Experts revealed that Djurgarden are 11th in the Swedish top flight after a disappointing start to the season

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca is "worried" about playing on a much-criticised artificial surface in the semi-final of the Conference League. 

The Blues face Djurgarden on Thursday on a pitch even the Swedish club's manager Jani Honkavaara described as "horrible" after a match against GAIS last week. 

His criticism of the the 3Arena pitch has been echoed by Djurgarden's players, and rival managers. 

Work has been done to improve the quality of the surface by adding extra sand before the match against Chelsea.

But Maresca, who has watched replays of Djurgarden's past six matches in the past few days, is aware the pitch could cause issues.

"It can be a concern," he said. "I'm a little bit worried about that. It's completely different [to grass].

"I know that in the last weeks even some of their players were complaining about the pitch. They play every week, so for us it's a different one. 

"But there are no excuses, no reasons why we are not going to compete tomorrow and the second game at all."

Despite the pitch, Chelsea remain huge favourites to advance. In Uefa's league rankings, the Premier League is first and Swedish Allsvenskan 20th, with Chelsea's squad worth 44 times more than the hosts', according to Transfermarkt. 

But Maresca said he would not rest players despite Chelsea hosting Liverpool on Sunday with Champions League qualification still in the balance, adding: "We are not in a moment where we can say we decide to save players. 

"This is a semi-final, it's a European competition and we want to be in the final."

Christopher Nkunku and Robert Sanchez have not travelled for the match after picking up minor injuries and are being assessed, but Chelsea have their strongest available squad in Sweden. 

Maresca added: "Now that we are in the semi-final, the next target is the final, and then once, if we are able to reach the final, we go for the title.

"It's a huge title, because it's a European competition, and we can give this club the opportunity to be the only club in the world to win all the European competitions. It's also a responsibility for me, a responsibility for the players to get that."

Captain Reece James previously said Chelsea "disrespected the competition" after a shock 2-1 defeat by Legia Warsaw in the last round, although the Blues still progressed 4-2 on aggregate.

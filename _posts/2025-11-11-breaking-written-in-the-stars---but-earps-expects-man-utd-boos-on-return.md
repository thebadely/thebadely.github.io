Here’s what you need to know: Earps started in PSG's defeats by Wolfsburg and Real Madrid in the Champions League this season

Women's Champions League: Manchester United v Paris St-Germain

Venue: Old Trafford, Manchester Date: Wednesday, 12 November Kick-off: 20:00 GMT

Coverage: Watch on BBC Three & BBC iPlayer, commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live & BBC Sounds, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app

"Written in the stars, some might say." 

After 501 days since her departure, Mary Earps is returning to Manchester United.

But the goalkeeper, who played 125 times for the club during a five-year spell, will be lining up on the other side of the pitch when Paris St-Germain visit Old Trafford in the Women's Champions League on Wednesday.

"I knew it from the moment they qualified. Sometimes you just feel it. Maybe I manifested it, I don't know," Earps told BBC Sport.

The 32-year-old said she exchanged messages with her former United team-mate Ella Toone straight after the draw was made, while she added: "Going back to Old Trafford which is a special place, with so many amazing memories. I'm looking forward to the game."

The spotlight will certainly be on Earps, who has dominated headlines in recent weeks for comments about former England team-mate Hannah Hampton and manager Sarina Wiegman in her newly released autobiography.

"Mary was always a leader," said United manager Marc Skinner in his pre-match news conference. "She always had a voice and her own opinion - I always welcomed that. She always said what she was thinking.

"We welcome her back and absolutely respect her for what she did here. We also welcome her back as an opponent and I have to be clear on that. During the game, it's about us trying to win against Mary."

With United chasing a third successive win in the competition, what sort of reception can Earps expect at Old Trafford and how has she fared in the French capital?

Sitting Down With Mary Earps

Mary Earps was a big draw when she was at Manchester United

Earps was a hugely popular figure at United following her arrival in 2019 from Wolfsburg.

She played every league game for four seasons as United's outright number one and won the Women's FA Cup in May 2024 - the club's first major trophy -  before heading to France when her contract expired.

Earps had been offered a new deal to stay but, after much deliberation, she rejected it, saying the club were preparing to "undergo a period of transition" that "did not align" with where she was in her career.

"I think she will get a good reception. Her time at Manchester United was very good," ex-England midfielder Fara Williams told Football Focus.

"She took them to their first Champions League finish while she was there. She had second-placed finishes with United, played in FA Cup finals. She had a great time at the club and the fans adored her, so I'm sure she'll go back to a good reception."

Earps, though, was less hopeful.

"I'm probably expecting a little booing," she admitted.  "I hope it's a little bit, but it might be a lot.

"A few of the fans have come out to support me at PSG, but Manchester United is their number one team. I understand that."

While he can't control what reception Earps will receive, Skinner said he was looking forward to welcoming her back to Manchester and hopes the new book will not change people's perceptions of her.

"Deep down I know Mary is a good person," he added. "I'm sure part of bringing out a book is bringing out controversial stuff that will help sell the book. I know that she has to defend that publicly.

"Knowing the human she is, I'm sure she will be getting criticism that she won't like. It's part of the other side of releasing a book.

"But she's a great person, she doesn't need me to say that really. I hope people toe the line with criticism, but I'm sure Mary understands the situation she's put herself in.

"She's on a platform where people are interested in what she says, so that's a credit to her and to her hard work.

"The goalkeeper we had at the start, to the one that left, was not the same person. She transformed."

Speaking in a BBC interview earlier this year, Earps said her move to PSG had allowed her to escape "the craziness of England".

She fitted seamlessly into the team, instantly becoming the club's number one to start 22 of their 24 league matches last term.

But it was a disappointing season for PSG as they ended the campaign 10 points behind Lyon, who also beat them in the play-off final, while they were also knocked out in the second round of Champions League qualifying.

And just as her journey in Paris was getting started, Earps' England career was beginning to wind down. Despite playing regularly for her club, Lionesses boss Wiegman gave more opportunities to Chelsea keeper Hampton.

When Hampton was handed the starting spot ahead of Euro 2025, Earps described the decision as "unjust" and subsequently announced her retirement from international football just before the tournament started.

This term, PSG find themselves second in the league, three points behind Lyon, and head to Manchester in search of a first Champions League win after losing to Wolfsburg and Real Madrid.

Earps has started every game in both competitions, conceding 15 goals in nine matches - including six in the 6-1 defeat by Lyon.

PSG head coach Paulo Cesar has "no doubts whatsoever" Earps is ready to take on her former club, despite the furore surrounding her book.  

"She is completely ready for the game," he said. "Has there been an impact on her as a person? I can't see it. 

"If there is anything in the dressing room, it hasn't filtered through to me and I see her every day."

PSG defender Olga Carmona added all her team-mates had "a great deal of confidence" in the keeper, who was capped 53 times by England.

"It's a pleasure to play with Mary, I'm very lucky to be in the same team as her. It creates safety and security we all need at the back.

"As a defender, we have very good communication between us. I value her winning mentality and we see it in the matches she plays."

It has been recently reported that Yoane Wissa completed a protracted Â£55m move from Brentford on deadline day

Yoane Wissa does not have to look too far for inspiration.

Alan Shearer, Jackie Milburn, Andy Cole, Malcolm Macdonald and Les Ferdinand are just some of the prolific strikers who have worn Newcastle United's iconic number nine shirt.

Wissa is the latest in a long line to inherit it, and he offered a reminder why in his side's 3-0 Champions League win against PSV Eindhoven at St James' Park.

On a night supporters unfurled a banner urging their side to "write the next headline", Wissa certainly did so.

Not only did he open the scoring after just eight minutes, the forward also set up his side's second goal with the aggressive manner in which he pressed slack PSV defender Yarek Gasiorowski.

No wonder the man of the match left the field to a standing ovation after he was taken off by head coach Eddie Howe midway through the second half.

The prospect of sampling such moments under the lights had long served as inspiration after Wissa suffered a knee injury while on international duty with DR Congo back in September.

"It's been a tough start for him here," Howe said. "For any new player to come and get a serious injury, having not even done a training session, that's really tough mentally.

"So it's taken us a while to get him to a level that's close to his best, and I still feel he's got some more to come.

"A big night for him tonight because in part that's why he came to the club - for these nights - and I'm just pleased that he's made a positive impact."

It has taken Wissa time to deliver such performances.

Wissa, who had already had a disrupted pre-season, following his protracted departure from Brentford, has only scored three goals since making his debut for Newcastle last month.

The forward has looked rusty at times, failing to take a big chance to open the scoring in the defeat against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals last week.

But Wednesday night showed what he can bring to this side.

Howe had called on Wissa to "max out" before the game, and he led the press effectively against a naive PSV side, who repeatedly played out from the back.

That certainly did not go unnoticed by fellow goalscorer Harvey Barnes.

"He's had a tough start since he's come here," he told TNT Sports.

"Obviously injured for a long time. I had a similar start here. I know how tough it is just watching from the stands, so I know how delighted he will be. 

"A first Champions League goal. I thought he played really well so I'm buzzing for him."

The challenge for Wissa, of course, is to start scoring more regularly.

But he is a poacher in a differing mould to the towering Nick Woltemade, who likes to come in deep.

Of those forwards to have played a minimum of 250 minutes in the Premier League this season, Wissa ranks first for cross option runs per game.

These are defined by Opta as runs to get into the penalty area to make yourself available for a cross while your team-mate has the ball in a wide area.

Wissa also ranks 15th for runs in behind.

Given their differing qualities, Howe felt it was "transformative" to have Wissa available after Woltemade had to shoulder the burden up front in his absence.

It had always been the plan for the pair to share the load after Newcastle lost top scorer Alexander Isak to Liverpool last summer, and Wissa's Premier League experience helps explain why Newcastle paid such a hefty Â£55m fee.

"Yoane's career at Brentford was brilliant to watch from afar because I thought he was outstanding for them, scoring a number of massive goals," Howe said.

"I loved his attitude and the way that he played, the determination and aggression that he played with."

Such aggression is one of the reasons Wissa is likely to line up from the off against holders Paris St-Germain next week.

Newcastle are in a strong position going into that final game of the league phase, and sit in seventh place in the standings.

Newcastle have already secured a last 16 play-off spot, and still have the chance to reach the knockout stages automatically with a landmark result in the Parc des Princes next week.

While Howe refuted talk of "revenge" after a controversial stoppage-time penalty was awarded against his side on their last visit to the French capital in 2023, the visitors certainly won't need any added motivation.

"We know what we can do when we turn up against teams," Barnes added. 

"We had a sour taste after the game a couple of years ago, and it's one we will want to go and put right. 

"It's a massive challenge - they're a quality side - but why not?"

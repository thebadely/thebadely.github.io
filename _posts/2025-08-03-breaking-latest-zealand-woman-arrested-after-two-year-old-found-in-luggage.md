According to new developments, A woman in New Zealand has been arrested after a two-year-old girl was found in her luggage while she was travelling on a bus. 

Police said officers were called to a bus stop in Kaiwaka, a small town in the north of the country, on Sunday after a passenger asked for access to the luggage compartment. 

"The driver became concerned when he noticed the bag moving. When the driver opened the suitcase, they discovered the two-year-old girl," New Zealand Police said a statement.

The woman, 27, has been arrested and charged with ill-treatment/neglect of a child. 

"The little girl was reported to be very hot, but otherwise appeared physically unharmed," police said. 

She has been taken to hospital, where she is undergoing medical assessment, they added. 

The relationship between the woman and the child has not been disclosed. 

The woman is due to appear in the North Shore District Court on Monday.

"We would like to acknowledge and commend the bus driver, who noticed something wasn't right and took immediate action, preventing what could have been a far worse outcome," police said.

According to new developments, Which in-form striker is the player worth having in your FPL team?

Fantasy Premier League managers have flirted with the second forward spot in their team all season and while Erling Haaland is a set and forget for pretty much every team, landing on a second striker that justifies his price and produces points consistently has been a problem position for most.

Pre-season favorite Joao Pedro has two goals in nine, one time bandwagon Jean-Philippe Mateta can't find the form we saw last season, Victor Gyokeres has as many attacking returns as his centre-back team-mate Gabriel (five) and Nick Woltemade is now sharing minutes with Yoane Wissa.

A set and forget second forward that we can leave in our teams for the foreseeable would be a welcome addition to most squads and there are arguably two main contenders putting their hand up in Ollie Watkins and Igor Thiago.

Watkins is the in-form forward in the league right now and after a slow start which saw only one goal in his first 13, he now has six goals and two assists in his last seven league games. Pundits will speak about confidence and hot streaks and Watkins is no better example of a player that you can trust when he's in the middle of a purple patch.

Villa have excellent fixtures too and while the entry point of Crystal Palace away might look difficult on paper, they're on a seven-match wineless run and have had arguably the toughest fixture schedule of all teams over the festive period. 

From Gameweek 22 Villa then have four home games in six with Everton, Brentford, Brighton and Leeds visiting Villa Park, where 10%-owned Watkins has a fantastic record.

Thiago was the second most sold player last Gameweek and he's going to be one of the most bought this time round off the back of his 17-pointer at Everton.

With 14 goals, only Haaland has scored more than the Brazilian and in similar fashion to the Norwegian, Thiago is very much the talisman for his team. The goals at Brentford aren't shared around and chances are very much funneled to Thiago. It often feels like the wide forwards and midfielders around him have a sole purpose to create big chances for their number nine. 

Rice, Watkins & Cunha make cut - FPL team of the week

Brentford have an impressive home record and they welcome Sunderland and Nottingham Forest in two of their next three matches. At seven million, Thiago is phenomenal value with 108 points so far this season.

Huge Ekitike and Jarrod Bowen are worth a mention too. Ekitike is a doubt for Thursday's trip to Arsenal but we've seen enough from him to suggest if he can stay fit, he's going to score lots of goals in the second half of the season and Alexander Isak's injury only cements his place in the team. 

Burnley come to Anfield in Gameweek 22 and Ekitike owners will be very conscious of that when deciding if they sell him this week.

Bowen meanwhile costs considerably more than the likes of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Danny Welbeck, Richarlison and Thiago but does rank third for overall points among forwards this season. Unfortunately for him, by being listed as a forward this season he will earn fewer points than in years gone by when he's been a popular midfielder in the game.

The barrier to entry here though for many won't be Bowen per se, it's the trust issues managers have with West Ham and their ability to score goals and win games. Ekitike, Thiago and Watkins feel more reliable, partly because we trust their team and those around them to provide.

According to new developments, Ethan McLeod signed for Macclesfield in July

Macclesfield forward Ethan McLeod has died in a car accident on the M1 motorway while travelling back from a game on Tuesday.

McLeod, 21, was returning from his team's National League North match at Bedford Town in which he had been a substitute.

The accident occurred at around 22:40 GMT near Northampton when his white Mercedes collided with a barrier.

Macclesfield described McLeod as "incredibly talented" and a "well-respected member" of their squad.

In a statement, the club said:, external "News of Ethan's passing has devastated our entire club and no words can convey the immense sense of sadness and loss that we feel now." 

McLeod joined Wolverhampton Wanderers' academy at the age of seven.

He went on to play for the club's Under-21s in the EFL Trophy but never made an appearance for the first team.

The Birmingham-born forward had a loan spell with Alvechurch in the Southern League, before short periods with Rushall Olympic and Stourbridge after leaving Molineux.

He arrived at Macclesfield in July after a successful trial.

McLeod played seven times for the Silkmen, most recently on Saturday in an FA Trophy fixture at South Shields, while he scored his third goal for them in a 1-1 draw with Kings Lynn Town on 10 December.  

Macclesfield described McLeod as having a "lust for life" and an "unwavering work ethic", which was an inspiration to those around him.

While referring to his "unique smile", the club offered their condolences to the player's family and friends.

"The deep mental scars elicited from Ethan's passing will undeniably never heal â but one thing is for sure, and that is Ethan's vibrant legacy will never fade, no matter how much time passes in the future," the club added.

Macclesfield's next league fixture is scheduled to be at Alfreton Town on Saturday, although the club has not yet said if the game will go ahead.

Wolves, where McLeod's younger brother Conor, 20, plays for the Under-21 team, said, external they were "heartbroken" by the death of their former player.

The Premier League club said they will "provide care and support to Conor and his family" after the loss of his brother. 

A minute's silence will be held before Saturday's home game against Brentford.

McLeod competed for VZN FC in season one of Baller League, who said they were "devastated" upon hearing the news.

"We send our love and condolences to his family, friends and team-mates at this heartbreaking time," they added., external 

McLeod scored an 81st-minute equaliser against King's Lynn on 10 December

McLeod scored three goals in his seven games for Macclesfield, including one on his debut against Atherton LR in an FA Cup second qualifying round tie in September.

The Silkmen Supporters' Trust (SST) said it was "devastated" at the loss of "one of our own".

"Ethan had broken into the first team of our club and started to make a real difference, scoring two goals in recent weeks," fan and SST board member Jon Smart told BBC Sport.

"He was a nippy forward and the fans viewed him as an important member of the first-team squad, improving with every game and with an eye for goal, with a real potential to go back up higher in the football pyramid.

"He regularly came over to the bar after games to mingle with supporters and one couldn't help but notice his engaging smile and cheery and happy demeanour after games. 

"His passing will have a terrible impact on the players. Losing one of their own in such awful circumstances will be a terrible cross to bear."

Before the club reformed as Macclesfield FC, Macclesfield Town manager Keith Alexander and midfielder Richard Butcher died 10 months apart.

Smart added: "Like Alexander in 2010 and Butcher in 2011 - both lost in difficult and tragic circumstances - Ethan McLeod will be forever a Silkman."

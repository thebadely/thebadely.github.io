Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Josh Kerr (right) fell in the 800m at last year's UK Athletics Championships as athletes competed for a place in Britain's Olympic squad

Britain's top athletes will compete in Birmingham this weekend for a place at the World Championships.

The nation's stars will target a top-two finish at the UK Athletics Championships which, combined with a World Athletics entry standard, will guarantee a place in the squad for Tokyo.

Olympic medallists Josh Kerr, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Georgia Hunter Bell are among those in action on Saturday and Sunday, but are each assured of selection by virtue of their achievements last summer.

Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson is among the notable absentees as she continues her recovery from injury, and faces a race against time to prove her fitness for the championships which take place in Japan's capital from 13-21 September.

For most athletes competing at this weekend's British trials, the equation is simple.

A top-two finish in their respective event in Birmingham, accompanied by a World Athletics entry standard achieved since 1 August 2024, will confirm their place in Tokyo.

Selection is guaranteed for individual medallists from the 2024 Olympics and 2023 World Championships, and those who have been awarded a World Athletics wildcard - providing they have demonstrated "current form that gives confidence in their ability to fulfil the performance objectives of the championships".

According to UK Athletics, this involves "an assessment of the athlete's performances and performance consistency during the 2025 outdoor season".

Hodgkinson has not competed since winning gold at Paris 2024 almost 12 months ago.

But, having achieved the World Athletics entry standard with her performance at last summer's Games, the 23-year-old will focus on proving her fitness in the final weeks before the British squad is announced on 27 August.

The two-time world silver medallist suffered a hamstring tear in February and setbacks have further delayed her return - but she is due to compete at the Lausanne Diamond League on 20 August.

Matthew Hudson-Smith and George Mills also miss the trials, where permission to not compete is only granted in the case of illness or an injury.

For those who fail to finish inside the top two this weekend, and a maximum of three athletes per nation permitted to contest each individual event, remaining places may be awarded to those with a World Athletics entry standard, UKA Consideration Standard, or based on performances in designated competitions.

In Hodgkinson's absence, training partner Hunter Bell is entered in both the 800m and 1500m as she considers which event to target in Tokyo.

The Olympic 1500m bronze medallist is joined by Jemma Reekie in the 800m, while the 1500m also features Laura Muir, Revee Walcott-Nolan and Katie Snowden.

Competition is also fierce in the men's middle-distance events, with Max Burgin and Ben Pattison headlining the men's 800m, and Jake Wightman and Neil Gourley among the 1500m contenders.

World 1500m champion Kerr takes the opportunity to race over 5,000m, with teenage star Innes FitzGerald in the women's race.

In the sprints, Dina Asher-Smith contests the women's 200m, with Daryll Neita and Amy Hunt doubling up by adding the 100m.

Jeremiah Azu and Zharnel Hughes are among those aiming for glory in the men's events, with Louie Hinchliffe focusing his attention on retaining his 100m crown.

Charlie Dobson is favourite to retain his 400m title in the absence of Hudson-Smith, as is world indoor champion Amber Anning in the women's event.

In the field events, high jumper Morgan Lake will seek to continue her good form following her London Diamond League victory, while Molly Caudery is in pole vault action.

Johnson-Thompson is entered in the 100m hurdles, javelin and shot put as she builds towards her bid for a third world title.

With the World Para Athletics Championships taking place in New Delhi, India, from 26 September, Kare Adenegan, Zachary Shaw and Sophie Hahn are among the British stars also in action.

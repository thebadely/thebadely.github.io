According to new developments, England host Wales at Wembley on Thursday, 9 October in a friendly international before both sides return to their World Cup qualifying campaigns.

The two countries have enjoyed many notable encounters in a rivalry stretching back over a century - including at Euro 2016 when Chris Coleman's Wales made it all the way to the semi-finals.

It was Roy Hodgson's side though that came out on top in their Group B fixture and we want you to name all the players that featured in the match in Lille.

You have seven minutes to remember all 27. Good luck!

Experts revealed that McIlroy has taken some time off after finishing tied seventh at the Open

Rory McIlroy will not play in the opening play-off event of the PGA Tour season next week. 

The Masters champion was not listed in the field for the FedEx St Jude Championship in Memphis, which was released on Friday. 

Northern Ireland's McIlroy has not played since finishing tied seventh at the Open Championship at Royal Portrush last month. 

The tournament in Memphis will mark world number one Scottie Scheffler's return after his four-shot victory at the Open. 

Three-time FedEx Cup winner McIlroy, 36, struggled at the St Jude Championship last year, finishing joint second last on nine over par. 

The top 70 in the FedEx Cup standings after this week's Wyndham Championship will qualify for the St Jude.

After Memphis, the top 50 will advance to the BMW Championship in Maryland on 14-17 August. 

The season-ending Tour Championship, featuring the top 30 players, takes place in Atlanta the following week. 

McIlroy, who is second behind Scheffler in the FedEx Cup standings, is scheduled to play in the Irish Open at the K Club and the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in September before returning to the United States for the Ryder Cup in New York.

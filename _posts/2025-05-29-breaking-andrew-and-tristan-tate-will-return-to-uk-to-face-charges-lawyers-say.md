According to new developments, Andrew and Tristan Tate will return to the UK to face 21 criminal charges once proceedings against them in Romania have concluded, their lawyers have said.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Wednesday that it had authorised charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking against the brothers in 2024, before an extradition warrant was issued to bring them back from Romania.

Authorities in Romania are investigating the two British-Americans in a separate case, in relation to a number of charges which they deny.

In a statement on Thursday, lawyers for the Tates said that "once those proceedings are concluded in their entirety then they will return to face UK allegations".

Previously, the brothers' legal representatives said that UK allegations dated back to between 2012 and 2015.

At the time of an arrest warrant obtained by Bedfordshire Police in March 2024, the Tates said they "categorically reject all charges" and were "very innocent men".

A Romanian court has already ruled that the brothers could be extradited to UK following the end of any trial there, for which there is no clear timescale currently, and the CPS said "domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first".

The CPS said Andrew Tate, a 38-year-old influencer and former kickboxer, faces 10 charges connected to three alleged victims, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain.

Tristan Tate, 36, faces 11 charges connected to one alleged victim, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.

The CPS's charging decision came after it received a file of evidence from Bedfordshire Police.

Responding to the allegations on the Tates' behalf, their solicitors said there had been a "vast amount of misinformation in the media regarding the allegations faced by our clients" and that they were being subject to "a trial by media".

A statement added: "Regardless of your views, it must be the case that everyone that is tried in England and Wales has the expectation of a fair trial."

They added that "UK prosecutors refuse to give even the most basic information to allow our clients to understand the allegations they face".

The BBC has been told the CPS believes it is fully complying with its role in accordance with disclosure obligations.

In recent years, Andrew, a self-described misogynist, has built a massive online presence, including more than 10 million followers on X, sharing his lifestyle of fast cars, private jets, and yachts.

The pair were both born in the US but moved to Luton in the UK with their mother after their parents divorced.

Since first being arrested in Romania by the Romanian authorities in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking, the pair have largely been under travel restrictions in the country.

They then faced further allegations in Romania in August 2024 including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.

Earlier this year they unexpectedly had their travel ban lifted and visited Florida in the US, before returning to Romania less than a month later in March 2025.

British authorities faced criticism for allegedly not requesting an extradition to the UK while they were in Florida, after authorities there said they would have approved it, but the BBC understands that this was to avoid subverting the UK-Romania arrangement.

Given the complexity of the proceedings in Romania, their return to the UK is unlikely to be soon.

According to new developments, Families in Barnsley could soon get up to £100 per child to help with school uniform and equipment costs.

The council plans to spend £2.7m on a voucher scheme in time for the next academic year. If the idea is approved, pupils in secondary school would receive a uniform voucher of £100 each, with £50 going to primary school pupils.

For pupils in Year 11 a support pack containing study material and information about their health and wellbeing would also be provided.

The council's cabinet meeting on 9 July is due to consider the scheme, which it said was to help remove barriers to school attendance while saving families money.

The scheme would be open to families living in the borough who pay council tax to Barnsley Council, even if pupils attend schools outside the town. 

The uniform vouchers would be available to collect from local post offices, the council said.

Councillor Trevor Cave, cabinet spokesperson for children's services, said about 37,000 pupils would benefit from the scheme.

"We know that the start of a new school year can be a financially challenging time for families, which is why this practical support is so important, making sure that our families have more money in their pockets," he said.

"We're committed to removing barriers to education, so every child is supported to attend school every day with the opportunity to thrive, reach their full potential and be healthy, confident, and inspired to learn."

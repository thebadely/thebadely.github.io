Let's dive into the details: Helen Nelson was named in the Team of the Pool Stage by Opta

Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final: England v Scotland

Venue: Ashton Gate, Bristol Date: Sunday, 14 September Kick-off: 16:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, Sports Extra Two and BBC Sport website and app

Although the sun shone down on Clifton College as Scotland went through their captain's run, they have surely prepared for the storm clouds forecast for Sunday's Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final.

They won't just be met by the world's number one team, the hosts, the relentless England winning machine, but also a yellow warning for wind and potential downpours.

It might make for an atmospheric back drop, a Shakespearean setting to an all-or-nothing game in which Scotland play the part of defiant under-dog.

One day out from the game, the mood in camp was buoyant. The tunes boomed across a luscious playing field, silly group photos were snapped, and throngs of players chanted along to one specific song.

"All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us."

In the lead up and even during this tournament there have been numerous negative story lines surrounding this team.

Contract stalemates, uncertain futures, a departing head coach, players removed from cold storage. The mood music seemed muted from the outside.

Internally, the players - at the heart of a stand-off with the union - seem to have ignored the noise but the BBC's Sara Orchard had another theory.

"I think the person who has said it best so far is actually the former England captain Katy Daley-McLean, when she just said what Scotland are putting out on the field right now, is not because of what's going on behind, it's in spite of it.

"What they are doing that with all that baggage, is stunning, absolutely stunning."

Former Scotland captain and fly-half Lisa Martin agreed: "In a way, you'd kind of wish that they weren't performing as well because of it, because you're like, 'oh, clearly, it's absolutely fine'. 

"It's kind of camouflaging it, but's great that they're able to do this in spite of everything."

It's not the motivation the squad would have wanted, and in the long run that level of emotion is simply not sustainable. But in the performances so far, the proverbial two fingers have been stuck up to the doubters, and perhaps to the powers that be.

The weather in the south west has, so far this week, been rotten and it doesn't look set to change.

Although Ashton Lane is a little more sheltered than other venues, it will almost certainly have an effect on the game and perhaps lower the scoreline.

Given Scotland have usually been on the end of 50-point shellackings, one automatically assumes that will benefit them more than their hosts.

"The weather becomes a bit of an equaliser," former England winger Ugo Monye told the Rugby Union weekly podcast. "It will be tight and niggly, and it might take the Red Roses slightly longer to break the spirit of Scotland."

That's where Scotland fly-half Helen Nelson comes in. Any Scotland attack will come through her, and her kicking game will have to be perfect.

"Nelson is a real trump card for them," Orchard said. "As much as we have seen some sparkling rugby from their backs, if the weather plays out the way it looks like it will, they won't be able to fire the way they have earlier in the tournament.

"Her kicking game at fly-half is going to be absolutely key for them. We saw that Australia were set up to make sure the ball kept on going behind the heads of the England back three.

"Nelson will be relishing that opportunity."

"She's such a wicked operator," Monye agreed. "The question is whether she'll be able to get the front foot ball to dictate play.

"If she's given that, she'll cut you apart. You give her time and space and she'll make you look really silly."

Konkel was Scotland's first-ever contracted professional in the women's game

Just after the team was announced, which had former captain Jade Konkel returning to the starting XV, it was announced the number eight would be retiring at the end of the tournament, whenever that may be.

"You only do it to create this emotional groundswell, to let the players know," Monye said. "The last voice in the changing room is going to be Jade saying 'follow me, this is it'.

"When you are in knock-out rugby, that could be it. There's no better demonstration than a player saying 'this could be it for me'.

"'Some of you will play in more World Cups, but for me this could be the last time I walk off the pitch with a Scotland jersey on my back'.

"You don't need to say any more."

Of course, the reality is Scotland need to have the perfect game, and England to have an off day. Any mistake will be punished, any attack must be clinical. 

They've got the emotional drivers, they have the weather to create a tight game, they've got an idea of England's weaknesses. Will it be enough?

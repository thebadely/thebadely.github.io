Let's dive into the details: Kimberley Woods is an eight-time European champion 

Great Britain's Kimberley Woods claimed K1 silver in the Canoe Slalom World Championships.

The 30-year-old raced through the bottom half of the course in Penrith, Australia to finish behind Poland's Klaudia Zwolinska. 

Woods, who won bronze in the kayak cross and K1 at the 2024 Olympics, picked up a touch on gate 12 but managed to push Australia's Katie Ekhardt into third. 

A two-second penalty is incurred for touching one or both poles of a gate with any part of the paddler, boat or paddle.

"I think that touch is going to haunt me for a little bit," said Woods. 

"It was very slight but overall I'm thrilled with that.

"I wanted to go out there, give it my best. I really attacked it and I'm really pleased with how I reset after the touch."

Woods, the six-time world champion, returns to action on Saturday for the kayak cross.

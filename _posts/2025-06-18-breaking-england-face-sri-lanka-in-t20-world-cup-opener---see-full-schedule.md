Experts revealed that Nat Sciver-Brunt replaced Heather Knight as England captain in April 

England will face Sri Lanka at Edgbaston in the opening match of the Women's T20 World Cup on 12 June 2026. 

Last month it was confirmed that Lord's would host the final of the 12-team tournament, with Headingley, Old Trafford, Edgbaston, The Oval, the Hampshire Bowl and Bristol's County Ground as the other group-stage venues. 

England, Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa, India, West Indies, Pakistan and defending champions New Zealand have already qualified, and the four remaining places will be decided at a qualifying tournament later this year.

The format consists of two groups of six teams and the top two from each will progress to the semi-finals. 

England's group includes West Indies, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and two qualifiers, with Australia, India, South Africa and Pakistan in the other. 

Both semi-finals will be held at The Oval on 30 June and 2 July respectively, and the  final will be on Sunday, 5 July. 

The past six editions of the tournament have consisted of 10 teams. 

England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, said: "World Cups are always special, but this one already feels different - it has the potential to be truly game-changing. 

"It's going to be a huge moment for our sport and a brilliant opportunity to inspire young people and captivate fans across the country."

Other notable fixtures include India v Pakistan at Edgbaston on 14 June, while England face champions New Zealand at The Oval on Saturday 27 June and Australia take on India the following day. 

England have not won the tournament since its first edition in 2009, when they beat New Zealand under the captaincy of current coach Charlotte Edwards. 

They were runners-up to Australia in 2012, 2014 and 2018, were knocked out in the semis in 2020 and 2023 and did not make it out of the group stage last year. 

Australia have won the trophy a record six times, their most recent title coming in South Africa in 2023 - before New Zealand's surprise win last autumn. 

However under Edwards and new captain Sciver-Brunt, England's first major assignment comes at the end of September with the 50-over World Cup taking place in India.

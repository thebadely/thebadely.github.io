Bath flanker Guy Pepper has been named in England's 36-player training squad for their match against a France XV at Allianz Stadium Twickenham on Saturday.

The 22-year-old, who has trained with England in the past, was player of the match as Bath beat Leicester 23-21 on Saturday to lift their first Premiership title in 29 years.

England head coach Steve Borthwick has named nine other players who featured in the final, including try scorers Max Ojomoh of Bath and Leicester's Jack van Poortvliet.

According to new developments, Hyundai Motor Group says it will roll out human-like robots in its factories from 2028, as major companies race to use the new technology.

The South Korean firm showed off Atlas, a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Monday.

Hyundai says it "plans to integrate Atlas across its global network", including a plant in the US state of Georgia that was involved in a massive immigration raid in 2025.

Other firms that have said they will use humanoid robots in their operations include Amazon, Tesla and Chinese car making giant BYD.

The Atlas robots will gradually take on more tasks, said Hyundai. The firm owns a majority stake in Boston Dynamics, the technology company famous for Spot the robot dog.

Atlas, which is designed for general industrial use, is being developed to work alongside people and autonomously manage machines.

Hyundai said the robots will help ease physical strain on human workers, handle potentially dangerous tasks and pave the way for wider use of the technology.

The firm did not say how many robots it would initially deploy or how much the project will cost.

Speaking at CES, Hyundai's vice chair, Jaehoon Chang, acknowledged concerns that human workers could lose their jobs to robots. But he said people will still be needed to train the robots, among other roles, the news agency Reuters reported.

Monday's announcement came after Hyundai said in 2025 that in would invest more than $20bn (£15.5bn) in the US, supporting President Donald Trump's plans to boost manufacturing in the country.

The firm said it would expand car production in the US and invest in autonomous driving technology and artificial intelligence (AI).

Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla has also invested heavily in its humanoid robot, Optimus.

Hyundai's battery plant in Georgia, which it operates in partnership with electronics giant LG, is one of its key facilities in the US.

In September 2025, US immigration officers raided the plant and arrested hundreds of workers, including at least 300 South Korean citizens.

The workers had their legs shackled in scenes that sparked outrage in South Korea.

President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's chief executive José Muñoz warned that the raid could deter foreign investment in the US.

Later that month, Washington and Seoul reached an agreement to release the detained workers.

Trump said he opposed the raid and that the US had an "understanding" with the world on the need to bring in experts to set up specialised facilities and train local workers.

Muñoz said in November that the White House had phoned him personally to apologise for the raid.

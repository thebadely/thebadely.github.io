It has been recently reported that Anel Ahmedhodzic has scored 12 goals for Sheffield United

Feyenoord have submitted an offer worth Â£15.6m (18m euros) for Sheffield United defender Anel Ahmedhodzic.

The 26-year-old has made 114 appearances for the Championship club since joining in July 2022 from Malmo.

Ahmedhodzic was a target for Premier League club Wolves last summer, but he remained at Bramall Lane for the 2024-25 campaign in which the Blades lost in the play-off final to Sunderland.

Feyenoord, who finished third in the Eredivisie last season, sold Slovakian centre-back David Hancko to Atletico Madrid in July and have turned to Ahmedhodzic as a replacement.

The Bosnia-Herzegovina international spent three years with Nottingham Forest between January 2016 and 2019, before spells at Malmo, Hobro IK and Bordeaux.

Sheffield United begin the Championship season under new manager Ruben Selles at home to Bristol City on Saturday, 9 August.

Dutch outfit Feyenoord host Fenerbahce in the first leg of third-round qualifying in the Champions League on Wednesday, 6 August.

'I've just said something that's true' - Postecoglou defends second-season trophy comments

"I always win things in my second year. Nothing has changed. I don't say things unless I believe them."

Having just seen his side lose 1-0 at home to rivals Arsenal back in September, Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was in defiant mood and that quote has followed and been repeated to him all season.

Yet, the 59-year-old Australian, who took charge of Spurs in July 2023, has had the last laugh with his side beating Manchester United 1-0 in the Europa League final in Bilbao on Wednesday. 

Tottenham, whose last trophy was the 2008 League Cup, had come close to proving him right earlier this year.

They held a 1-0 lead after the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Liverpool, only to then capitulate 4-0 in the reverse fixture at Anfield. Spurs also fell at the fourth-round hurdle of the FA Cup, losing at Aston Villa.

It all came against the backdrop of the club's worst campaign in the Premier League era as they sit in 17th place with one game to go and a mammoth 45 points behind champions Liverpool.

In his 100th game in charge of Spurs, the Europa League triumph also took the club into the Champions League and silenced Postecoglou's critics as he maintained his superb second-year record - and may keep him in his job.

He won the Australian title with both South Melbourne and Brisbane Roar and the Japanese league with Yokohama F. Marinos - all in his second season or second full season in charge.

Postecoglou also won the Asian Cup two years after becoming Australia boss - and the Scottish championship in both seasons with Celtic.

He did not see out two seasons in charge of the three clubs he failed to win anything at - smaller clubs Panachaiki and Whittlesea Zebras, and Melbourne Victory, whom he left after 18 months for the Australia job.

We take a look at how he has enjoyed second-season success throughout his career.

Postecoglou had a win percentage of 73% at Celtic, the best spell of his career

Matches: 113. Wins: 83 Draws: 12. Losses: 18. Goals scored: 284. Goals conceded: 108.

Postecoglou came to Celtic in June 2021, just after Steven Gerrard had guided Rangers to the Scottish Premiership title.

But the Australian did not need two seasons before winning, as he took the Bhoys to five trophies in his two years at the club.

In his first campaign they became Scottish champions and won the League Cup, before they added the Scottish Cup to make it a domestic treble in his second year with him then before moving to Tottenham.

Former England goalkeeper Joe Hart had already won two Premier League titles with Manchester City before he was instrumental in Celtic's success. He felt one of Postecoglou's main strengths was getting his players to view the game in a different way and teach them new skills.

"He is top, really, really good," said Hart after Postecoglou's second Scottish title victory in May 2023. "He is really clear in what he wants and the biggest buzz for me is playing for someone who is pushing me and I am learning new things every day - it makes me feel alive.

"I have played in different teams that have been successful. Identity in football has always been there, but in terms of having a real way of playing, this is the first time I have been part of a team with that.

"I genuinely feel comfortable making risky passes, short passes, and if someone does miss a pass or a tackle and the ball goes in, I don't think any of us would even flinch because that's what we are being asked to do."

Matches: 161. Wins: 79. Draws: 30. Losses: 52. Goals scored: 313. Goals conceded: 228.

Before Celtic, Postecoglou had a three-and-a-half-year spell in Japan with Yokohama F. Marinos.

He went there in January 2018 and almost won a trophy in his first 10 months, only to lose 1-0 to Shonan Bellmare in the J.League Cup.

But success was not too far away as his side then won the J1 League to become Japanese champions, finishing six points clear of FC Tokyo.

That title took the side into the Japanese Super Cup (their version of the Community Shield), but Yokohama could not add another trophy as they lost 3-2 on penalties against Vissel Kobe after Yokohama had fought back from 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 down to leave it at 3-3 after 90 minutes.

"Ange really gave the club purpose," said Japanese football writer Dan Orlowitz.

"It was a refreshing style of football that the league hadn't really seen. Even when YFM struggled results-wise in 2018 it was very clear that the players and above all Ange believed in what he was doing.

"The fans believed in him as a result, and over the next year he let go of players who weren't a good fit for the system and brought in players who were a great fit. All of that added up to the triumph of 2019."

Matches: 49. Wins: 22. Draws: 12. Losses: 15. Goals scored: 86. Goals conceded: 58.

During his playing career, Postecoglou was a defender and represented Australia four times and in 2013 he got the chance to become his country's national manager.

At the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Australia finished bottom of a tough group that also included the Netherlands, Chile and 2010 winners Spain.

Australia hosted the Asian Cup in January 2015 and Postecoglou guided the Socceroos to the final with a crowd of more than 76,000 watching the game against South Korea in Sydney.

Midfielder Massimo Luongo (now at Ipswich Town) put Australia ahead, before Son Heung-min, Postecoglou's current captain at Tottenham, equalised in the 91st minute to take the tie to extra-time. But James Troisi, who developed through Newcastle United's academy, scored the winner as Postecoglou and Australia celebrated a 2-1 victory to win the tournament.

Former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill was a key player for Australia at that time and, in an interview with Optus Sport in 2024,, external was full of praise for Postecoglou.

"I never knew Ange until he came to the Australia job, he had a great pedigree," said Cahill. "When you listen to him, everything he talks about is simple and logical - he wants the ball in play, action and intensity and that's what the players want.

"The way you look at a coach is their presence and secondly their training, everything was measured and calculated. What I love with Ange is he is very honest, very detailed. He has a really nice way about him and you see the way he connects with players."

Matches: 83. Wins: 42. Draws: 24. Losses: 17. Goals scored: 142. Goals conceded: 91.

Before becoming Australia manager, Postecoglou had an 18-month spell at Melbourne Victory, but was not there long enough to have a second full season.

That came after he had great success with another Australian side in Brisbane Roar. In a two-and-a-half-year spell, they won the A-League Championship in 2010-11 and retained their title the following year.

"Ange's massive strength is his ability to be able to bring players along that journey and buy into what he does," former Brisbane captain Matt Smith told BBC Sport.

"There's zero tolerance for players that don't want to follow. We were never made to feel comfortable, we were always pushing to be better, always developing, always working harder than any group I've experienced before.

"It didn't matter if you were the biggest player in the dressing room or the youngest - if you weren't pulling your weight or following his principles, he was very ruthless."

For a seven-year period, Postecoglou coached the Australian youth teams, gaining success at both the Oceania Under-17 and Under-20 Championships, winning each event on three occasions.

After that, he had brief spells at Greek side Panachaiki (nine months) and Australian outfit Whittlesea Zebras (three months) before joining Brisbane Roar.

Matches: 155. Wins: 82. Draws: 30. Losses: 43. Goals scored: 276. Goals conceded: 194.

Postecoglou's first managerial job came at South Melbourne in the Australian National Soccer League (the predecessor to Australia's A-League).

It did not take long for him to be successful as he steered them to successive championships in 1997-98 and 1998-99, with them also winning the Oceania Club Championship in 1999.

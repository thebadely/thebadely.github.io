It has been recently reported that EastEnders and James Bond actor Colin Salmon has said he is "genuinely grateful" for the "compassion" he was shown by a court after he avoided a driving ban for speeding.

The actor plays George Knight in the BBC One soap and also appeared in three Bond films from the Pierce Brosnan era - Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day.

Salmon already had nine points on his licence and received three more for travelling at 24mph in a 20mph zone in London last March.

That would usually trigger an automatic six-month disqualification from driving, but Salmon avoided a ban, partly because he cares for his seriously ill wife and daughter and drives them to medical appointments. 

Writing on X on Thursday, Salmon apologised and said he appreciated the understanding shown for his "extraordinary circumstances".

"I hold my hands up, take full responsibility & apologise," he wrote. "I actually feel the 20mph limit has improved quality of life in London.

"Nine points in seven weeks within half a mile of my front door. Proves the maxim 'you're more likely to have an accident five mins from home!'

"The court weighed up our extraordinary circumstances, fined me but showed compassion for which I'm genuinely grateful."

He added: "Here's to a less eventful and healthy 2026."

Salmon, 64, appeared at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court in south-west London earlier this week.

He pleaded guilty to driving his Suzuki Wagon in excess of the 20mph limit in  Acton, near his Shepherds Bush home, on 31 March last year.

The actor already had nine points for speeding in April 2023, running a red light in February 2025, and driving without due care and attention in April 2025.

On Tuesday, Salmon was fined £666, with £130 costs, ordered to pay a £266 victim surcharge and received three more penalty points, but avoided a driving ban.

Salmon is married to artist and illustrator Fiona Hawthorne, who previously revealed she was diagnosed with a rare lung condition, interstitial lung disease, which requires her to use an oxygen tank. She underwent a lung transplant in the US in 2024.

The couple's daughter Sasha also fell ill with lymphoma, a cancer that affects the blood cells, in 2019.

They also have a high-functioning autistic son, and Salmon himself underwent hip replacement surgery last year.

Bench chairman Mark Stollery told him: "We note you are the main breadwinner and carer for your family and within the family, members have life-limiting conditions, including your wife and children."

The magistrate noted Salmon and his family would suffer "exceptional hardship" if he was disqualified, adding: "They rely on you abnormally compared to most families and we also note your charitable work and that takes up time and travel."

Salmon previously said he took the role in EastEnders in 2022 as he "can't be far from home" because his wife is "not well".

His character in the soap, ex-boxer George Knight, is the patriarch of the Knight family and a former co-owner of the Queen Vic pub.

In James Bond, Salmon played MI6 deputy chief of staff Charles Robinson, and was often featured in scenes along side Dame Judi Dench's M.

Salmon's other screen credits include Death In Paradise, Silent Witness, Band of Gold, Judge John Deed, Bad Girls, Doctor Who, Spooks and Midsomer Murders.

Let's dive into the details: Rangers' Leanne Crichton and Celtic's Elena Sadiku go head to head on Friday

Rangers against Celtic kicks off a weekend of three derbies in the Scottish Women's Premier League as the Glasgow rivals meet under the lights at Ibrox on Friday.

Always intriguing games, they can also prove significant in terms of the title race, but there is a danger that might not be the case this season.

Both have been off the pace so far this term, with Celtic sitting in third, six points behind leaders Glasgow City and one off reigning champions Hibernian, with Rangers three points further adrift in fifth.

Rangers trail despite winning their previous meeting with Celtic this season, 2-0 away from home in early September.

As their second meeting looms, we ask what is the state of play for both sides ahead of this Old Firm derby?

Rangers head coach Leanne Crichton admits the early days of her tenure have been "a whirlwind" and "challenging". 

The former City and Scotland midfielder arrived in post just two weeks before the new season and, having lost some key players in the summer window, also had to contend with a depleted squad through injury.

That has played a part in the side dropping points this season. 

In October, Rangers lost to Hibs after surrendering a 2-0 lead, while earlier this month a slow start against Heart of Midlothian resulted a 3-2 defeat. 

Ibrox has also not been the fortress they desire.

In their first game of the season there, Hearts scored a late equaliser to share the spoils, while City left with all three points in September.

It is a familiar story from last season, when Hibs stole the title from Rangers' grasp in their final-day winner-take-all shootout.

While Crichton says her players "love it and thrive on it" and she takes some positives from their performances at their Govan home, she concedes "the results have not been what we wanted".

However, she views Celtic's first visit of the season as "a brilliant opportunity", believes "any Friday night game always feels better" and hopes her players will "maximise playing at Ibrox" this time.

With City favourites to take all three points when they visit sixth-placed Montrose on Sunday, Rangers cannot afford to fall further behind.

Although Celtic have also come second best to some of their main rivals this season, some observers feel they have had a better start than expected.

Last season failed to live up to expectations as they looked to retain the title after their historic first win in the previous campaign. 

The demands of Champions League football and reports of unrest within the camp were not conducive to a successful season.

The loss of key centre-half Caitlin Hayes at the start of this year, followed by some significant departures in the close season, led to a sense that all was not well.

An away win over Hearts, a team that caused them some problems the previous season, provided a solid start. 

Head coach Elena Sadiku said it was important to "build upon that win", but when it came to facing the sides you would expect to be their challengers this season, they dropped points.

A draw with Hibs was followed by a defeats by Rangers and City - all at home.

The loss to City was a sore one and prompted the Swede to speak out, as she seemed to criticise Celtic's level of investment into the women's side.

"I feel right now that we are in a situation where teams are investing strongly and you can see how tight it is every season," Sadiku said. "Teams are getting better and better and we need to push in the same direction as well." 

A Celtic team boss hitting out at the failure to strengthen their squad - a mirror image of the now departed Brendan Rodgers' complaints about the men's team.

Given some of their recent results and the current league standings, Sadiku maybe had a point given Celtic are behind both City and Hibs while level on points with Hearts. 

However, six points off the leaders is hardly insurmountable and a win over their Glasgow rivals on Friday could go some to getting them back on track. 

"There's bigger pressure on Rangers as they're behind us," Sadiku said. "It's been a while since we beat them, but belief is going to be more important than tactics and we have strong belief at the moment."

Rangers' record at Ibrox might also give Sadiku and her players some confidence for a trip they will repeat in February when Celtic visit the holders in the SWPL Cup semi-finals.

As Sadiku added: "The SWPL is tighter than ever, but that's the most exciting thing about this league - playing against Rangers. It is more than just a game."

According to new developments, James Wilson made his debut for Hearts during the 2023-24 season 

Tottenham have signed teenage striker James Wilson on loan from Hearts in a deal that includes an option to buy at the end of the season.

Arsenal were in talks with the Scottish Premiership leaders over a move for the 18-year-old - in a deal that was effectively a six-month trial.

Wilson, who became the youngest man to represent Scotland when he came on in their Nations League play-off tie against Greece in March, has joined Spurs' Under-21s side.

The Gunners later confirmed they had signed Scottish forward Evan Mooney, 18, from St Mirren for their academy.

Wilson has scored eight goals in 45 appearances for the Edinburgh club and has earned a spot in Scotland's senior side.

Earlier this week, Hearts manager Derek McInnes admitted the Premier League clubs' interest in Wilson had taken him by surprise.

"He's been restricted with minutes this season. It's tough to get into the first team at this age," McInnes told Sky Sports Scotland.

"Would we see the benefit of a loan? Yes, to get some minutes. But this one was a wee bit left-field."

Mooney has made 23 appearances in all competitions for Scottish Premiership St Mirren since making his senior debut in October 2024.

He came on in the Scottish League Cup final as St Mirren beat Celtic 3-1in December 2025.

He can play as an attacking midfield or as a centre-forward and is capped at Under-19 level for Scotland.

Wilson has been around Hearts for a number of years and there was considerable interest from Leeds United, before he signed his first professional contract just after his 16th birthday.

Although he played a number of matches for Hearts 'B', he has been training with the first team for the vast majority of his professional career.

Wilson scored six goals in 33 appearances last season, but has struggled to force his way into the line-up in this campaign thanks to the excellent form of Hearts' strikers.

He already has one Scotland cap to his name having been introduced to the squad by Steve Clarke last year.

James has twin brothers, Alfie and Stanley, who are also youth players at Tynecastle.

Arsenal are closing in on a deal to sign England Under-19 international Jaden Dixon from Stoke City.

The 18-year-old defender made his Stoke debut in the Championship last season, but has not played for the first team during the current campaign.

A source has told the BBC the deal is worth around Â£500,000.

Arsenal have changed the way they have gone about their academy recruitment in recent years and now have a more aggressive approach in signing young players.

The move for England Under-21 goalkeeper Tommy Setford from Ajax in 2024 was an example of this.

The 19-year-old was a signing for the academy, but has been training with the first team since he arrived.

Arsenal have also recently agreed deals for Ecuadorian twins Edwin and Holger Quintero, as well as signing 17-year-old Shamrock Rovers forward Victor Ozhianvuna, with the trio set to join when they turn 18.

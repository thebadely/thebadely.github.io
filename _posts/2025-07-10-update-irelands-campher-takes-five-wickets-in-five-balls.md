Watch: Ireland's Curtis Campher makes cricket history

Ireland international Curtis Campher has become the first male player to take five wickets from five balls in a professional match.

The all-rounder, 26, did so for Munster Reds in their Inter-Provincial T20 Trophy win over the North-West Warriors in Dublin.

The Warriors were chasing 189 but collapsed from 87-5 to 88 all out thanks to Campher's sensational spell.

The Reds captain's first wicket came when he bowled Jared Wilson with the penultimate delivery of the 12th over. Graham Hume was then trapped lbw to conclude the over.

Scorecard: Munster Reds beat North-West Warriors by 100 runs

'I was flying' - bowler's two hat-tricks in two overs

Returning in the 14th, the South Africa-born pace bowler completed the hat-trick when his Ireland international team-mate Andy McBrine was caught at deep mid-wicket.

Robbie Millar was then caught behind before Josh Wilson was bowled for the final wicket.

With the feat spread across two separate overs, Campher said he was initially unaware of the record.

"I wasn't really sure what was happening," he told Cricket Ireland. 

"I just kind of stuck to my guns and kept it real simple and luckily it kind of went off."

Campher, who previously took four wickets from four balls against the Netherlands at the 2021 T20 World Cup, was playing his second match since returning from a finger injury that caused him to miss Ireland's ODI and T20 series against West Indies this year.

"Performances aside, it has been really good just to be around the boys," he added.

"When you get injured, it's a bit of a dark place when you get into the gym and stuff like that, so it has been really nice.

"I have been really enjoying myself and putting pressure on myself to do well."

Zimbabwe Women all-rounder Kelis Ndhlovu previously took five wickets in five balls in a domestic under-19 T20 last year.

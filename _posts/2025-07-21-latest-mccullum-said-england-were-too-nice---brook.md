Here’s what you need to know: Harry Brook (right) says England are prepared to embrace 'needle' with India

Head coach Brendon McCullum told England they were "too nice" before the tetchy third Test against India, according to batter Harry Brook.

England's thrilling 22-run win at Lord's included a number of flashpoints between the two sides, starting on the third evening, when the tourists were annoyed by the time-wasting of home openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett.

India pace bowler Mohammed Siraj was subsequently punished for his celebration of Duckett's wicket on the fourth morning, while England seamer Brydon Carse and visiting all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja had to be separated on the final day.

England's aggression in the field was a feature of their defence of a target of 192, dismissing India for 170.

And Brook said McCullum's previous comments were raised on the fourth evening, when the match hung in the balance.

"He actually said a few days before that we are too nice sometimes," Brook told BBC Sport. 

"I brought it up the night before the last day: 'Baz said the other day we're too nice, I think tomorrow is a perfect opportunity to really get stuck into them'.

"It came at the perfect time. The opportunity that arose for us to not be the nice guys was because of what they did the night before.

"We watched two of our guys out there on their own, going back at the Indians after they were going at them. We just thought 'we're not standing for that'.

"We had a conversation and said 'it's time to not be those nice guys that we have been before'."

New Zealander McCullum's desire for England to show a different side to their character coincides with, or has resulted in, the enlisting of former All Blacks mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka.

During his time as New Zealand captain, McCullum altered the approach and perception of his team, using Enoka's theories on team culture as inspiration.

Enoka represented New Zealand at volleyball, but is best known for his work with the All Blacks. With Enoka on the staff, New Zealand won the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and 2015.

He first linked up with England before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May. It was at that time McCullum and captain Ben Stokes spoke about their team showing more "humility".

Enoka's presence is designed to aid the mental development of the England side in this year that includes the series against India and the Ashes tour of Australia.

On Monday he addressed the squad two days out from the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, where victory would give England a series win.

In terms of their combativeness on the field, England have lost some of their more aggressive characters in recent years. Stuart Broad and James Anderson have retired, while Jonny Bairstow and Ollie Robinson have been dropped.

Brook, who made his Test debut in McCullum's first summer in charge in 2022, said England had been "nice guys" for three years.

"At Lord's we had a conversation, we thought it was the perfect opportunity to not be the nice guys that we have been in the past three years," said the Yorkshireman. "To go out there and put them under more pressure than what they have probably had before.

"I don't think it's against the spirit of cricket. We weren't being personal, we weren't being nasty, we were just putting them under more pressure.

"We weren't going out there effing and jeffing at them, and being nasty people. We were just going about it in the right manner."

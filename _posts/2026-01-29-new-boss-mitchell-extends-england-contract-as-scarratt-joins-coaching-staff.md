Experts revealed that Mitchell was named World Rugby's Coach of the Year for 2025 after leading England to World Cup glory on home soil

John Mitchell will continue as Red Roses head coach through to the next Women's Rugby World Cup in 2029.

Mitchell led England's women to their first World Cup win in 11 years with victory on home soil in 2025.

"I am pleased to extend my time with the Red Roses," he said. "This extension provides continuity across a World Cup cycle and enables the programme to operate with a clear, long-term vision.

"The past three years have been both challenging and rewarding, delivering success at the highest level... and a culture that wins.

"This emerging group has the opportunity to continue leading our game globally."

In addition, having announced her playing retirement last year, England's record points-scorer Emily Scarratt joins the coaching set-up as "lead attack and backs coach".

Former England attack coach Lou Meadows will be leaving.

The addition of Scarratt will likely be popular with the England players, but Scarratt has not been given the job permanently yet.

The England announcement said Mitchell will be "head of attack" in the 2026 Six Nations, indicating this is a trial period for Scarratt, who will also continue with her role as assistant coach at PWR side Loughborough Lightening.

Scarratt is one of the most high-profile and respected figures in the women's rugby  world and since her retirement has continued to work for broadcaster TNT, as well as on her "The Good, the Scaz and the Rugby" podcast.

Scarratt moved into coaching as an assistant with PWR side Loughborough Lightning, who she represented as a player for seven seasons, when she retired in October 2025

Mitchell's reappointment was expected after a successful tenure at England coach that delivered their previously elusive World Cup win, after years of increasing investment from the RFU compared to other nations.

The New Zealander stressed that the Red Roses will be pushing on from the 2025 World Cup win.

"There is a strong sense of unfinished opportunities within the group," Mitchell explained, "and that will shape our preparation, training approach, and ongoing drive to raise our floor as we build our hunger in dynasty."

The 61year-old confirmed his interest in the British and Irish Lions Women's head coach role last year.

If he is successful in securing the role it would be an opportunity for an existing member of the current England coaching group to step up as England head coach while he was on a saabatical.

Sarah Hunter will continue as England defence coach and Louis Deacon as forwards coach.

Meadows' exit could be a means of freshening up the voices in England camp or a way of getting Scarratt on the coaching ticket

Meadows was a surprise appointment when she was named attack coach in 2023 and helped England evolve away from being a side that relied on its forwards and set-piece for results.

She had been linked with other international roles since the conclusion of the Rugby World Cup but her next move is yet to be confirmed.

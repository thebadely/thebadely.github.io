Here’s what you need to know: Sha'Carri Richardson won 100m gold at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest

Olympic gold medallist Sha'Carri Richardson has been arrested  for "dangerous excessive" speeding, according to jail booking records.

Richardson was booked into Orange County Jail in Florida at 19:39 local time on Thursday.

Jail records state the 25-year-old American was charged with driving dangerously and at "excessive speed of 100mph or more".

A spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriff's Department told BBC Sport that Richardson was allegedly travelling at 104 mph tailgating and crossing lanes of traffic to pass other drivers.

Her bond was set at $500 (Â£363).

The American won silver in the 100m at the Paris Olympics and gold as part of the USA's 4x100m relay team.

The state of Florida introduced new penalties for speeding offences in July. 

Under a new statute - known as the "Super Speeder" law - drivers can be fined up to $1,000 (Â£727), be mandated to appear at court if the allegation is more than 50 miles per hour over the limit, face jail time or have their licence revoked for repeat breaches.

In August, Richardson was arrested over allegations of domestic violence. She was released the following day and later said she would seek help.

Richardson missed the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 after testing positive for marijuana.

Experts revealed that Leanne Crichton is a well known pundit in Scottish football

Glasgow City assistant manager Leanne Crichton is the frontrunner to become the new Rangers women's head coach, BBC Scotland has learned.

The Ibrox club have held positive talks with the former Scotland player and she is expected to replace Jo Potter, who left to manage Crystal Palace last month.

The Ibrox side won the domestic cup double in both of Potter's seasons in charge and were third in the SWPL last term.

Crichton, 37, had three playing spells with City and also turned out for Celtic, Hibernian, Notts County and Motherwell, the latter where she also moved into coaching. She returned to Glasgow City to assist Leanne Ross in November.

The midfielder also won 72 senior international caps and has become a regular football television and radio pundit across BBC Scotland output.

Rangers, who travel to Italy on Monday for a pre-season training camp, open the new SWPL campaign away to Montrose on 17 August.

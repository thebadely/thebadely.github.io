It has been recently reported that Cameron Norrie has a 30-25 record in singles in 2025

Britain's Cameron Norrie was taken to three sets for the third successive match before reaching the Moselle Open semi-finals as he bids for a first title since 2023.

Norrie beat lucky loser Kyrian Jacquet 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 for his third victory over a Frenchman this week.

World number 27 Norrie, the only seeded player left in the draw, is into a first hard-court semi-final since Metz last year.

The 30-year-old is bidding for his first ATP Tour title since the 2023 Rio Open.

He will face either Italy's Lorenzo Sonego for a place in Saturday's final.

Norrie started the better of the two, racing into a 4-1 first-set led before a nosebleed and a late surge from Jacquet checked his momentum.

World number 156 Jacquet used his serve and forehand to good effect, winning five games in a row to take the opener and stay close in the second.

Norrie called for the physio when another nosebleed disrupted his service game at 4-4 and he had to save a break point before holding and dominating the eventual tie-break.

Ultimately 48 unforced errors cost Jacquet, who was broken to love at 4-4 to allow Norrie to serve out victory.

Elsewhere, Lorenzo Musetti is two wins away from a place at the season-ending ATP Finals after reaching the Athens Open semi-finals.

Italian world number nine Musetti must win the title to take the eighth and final spot at the tournament. If he does not, Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime will take up the place.

Musetti, who has not won a title for two years, moved past France's Alexandre Muller 6-2 6-4 to set up a semi-final against American Sebastian Korda.

World number five Novak Djokovic, who has also qualified for Turin, is a potential final opponent for Musetti.

Serbia's Djokovic reached the 199th semi-final of his astonishing career with a 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 win over Nuno Borges of Portugal.

The 38-year-old is aiming for his second title of the year and a 101st overall.

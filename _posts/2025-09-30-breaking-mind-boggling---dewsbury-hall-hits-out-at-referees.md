According to new developments, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has scored one goal for Everton this season

Everton midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall said it's "mind boggling" that he has already received a suspension after picking up five yellow cards in six Premier League appearances.

Dewsbury-Hall, booked for a 90th-minute challenge on Kyle Walker-Peters during Monday's 1-1 draw against West Ham, will miss Sunday's game against Crystal Palace.

The Everton midfielder won the ball but also appeared to catch the West Ham defender on the top of his foot during the challenge.

"Forgive me if I'm wrong, and I might be, but some of these decisions are so hard to take. Mind boggling," the 27-year-old posted on X, external.

It is not unheard of for players to be suspended for an accumulation of yellow cards at this stage of the campaign - it happened to striker Nicolas Jackson at Chelsea two seasons ago.

Everton manager David Moyes said referee Samuel Barrott's decision to show a card was "shabby" and questioned the level of officiating in the Premier League.

"I think the decisions we've had at the moment [have been frustrating], but I think all the managers might be saying that at the moment," Moyes said.

"I mean there's been a general poor level at the moment. I thought the decision on Dewsbury-Hall was a really shabby decision."

Why was Dewsbury-Hall booked in Merseyside derby?

Dewsbury-Hall has started all six of Everton's league games since joining from Chelsea in August in a deal worth about Â£28m.

His fourth yellow came in a 2-1 defeat against Merseyside rivals Liverpool on 20 September for taking a quick free-kick.

Team-mate Jack Grealish criticised referee Darren England for making that call and said he had "never seen that in my life".

Grealish was fouled by Liverpool's Curtis Jones in the 78th minute and stayed down injured after the incident. Twenty-nine seconds later, Dewsbury-Hall took the free-kick.

The referee was not facing the set-piece taker and had not blown his whistle when it was taken. He then proceeded to book the Everton player.

According to the International Football Association Board (Ifab), which determines the laws of the game, there is no law that states taking a quick free-kick is punishable with a card.

However, under Ifab's law 12.4, a player can be booked for dissent by word or action, or even for displaying unsportsmanlike behaviour such as showing a lack of respect for the game.

As the game was stopped for Grealish's injury, England could therefore deem that Dewsbury-Hall's set-piece could not proceed without his permission first.

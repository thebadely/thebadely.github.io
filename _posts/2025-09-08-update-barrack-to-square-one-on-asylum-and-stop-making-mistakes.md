Let's dive into the details: 1,097 is a figure that appears on some of the front pages, the number of people arriving on boats on Shabana Mahmood's first full day as home secretary. The Daily Mail says the surge of migrants tipped the total for the year over 30,000 in record time. The i Paper says Mahmood described the figure as "utterly unacceptable", while the Daily Telegraph says she accused the smuggling gangs of "wreaking havoc" on our borders.

The Sun says that the one measure that could smash asylum claims at a stroke and allow the deportations to begin would be to quit membership of the European Court of Human Rights. The Daily Mail says the only long-term solution to this crisis is a deterrent that drastically reduces the numbers arriving, "something for which Labour has no credible policy", it concludes.

The Times turns its attention to some of the other issues facing Sir Keir Starmer's new cabinet. It says the prime minister has tasked "Blairites" in his new team with securing growth, by changing regulations on building and net-zero and pushing through welfare reforms. The Daily Mirror says the government is being urged by the unions not to give up Angela Rayner's dream of workers' rights. The paper says her departure - and the sacking of the Employment Rights Minister Justin Madders - have sparked concern.

The Guardian looks ahead to the upcoming battle for the deputy Labour leadership and says Sir Keir has been warned by senior party figures to stop making mistakes, to avoid handing the country to Reform. The Daily Telegraph says the unions are expected to back someone closer to them than Rayner was. "Which Deputy would be the PM's nightmare?" the paper wonders.

Many of the papers celebrate the victory of England's cricketers over South Africa in Southampton. The Times says Jacob Bethell's first professional century led England to the largest winning margin in men's one-day-international history, despite South Africa's series victory.

The Daily Mail says the American musical couple Beyonce and Jay Z are to join the Cotswolds set, as they are close to buying a 58-acre property near the village of Great Dew. The paper says the area is already home to celebrities including the Beckhams, Jeremy Clarkson and the former US talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. Borrowing from the title of one of Beyonce's biggest hits, the Times headlines its coverage: "Crazy in Wiggington."

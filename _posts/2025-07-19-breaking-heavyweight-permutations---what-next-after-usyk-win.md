It has been recently reported that Oleksandr Usyk (left) is now a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion

Oleksandr Usyk cemented himself as the world's best heavyweight with a five-round demolition job of Daniel Dubois on Saturday at Wembley.

The reigning undisputed heavyweight champion for a second time, is there anyone that can challenge Usyk?

So, what fights do we know are happening? And what other bouts might be possible?

BBC Sport analyses the heavyweight fight scene.

The next big heavyweight fight on the horizon is Moses Itauma's tussle with Dillian Whyte on 16 August in Saudi Arabia.

It will be a huge step up for Itauma against the former world title challenger and we will likely learn a huge amount about the 20-year-old tipped to be the next big thing. 

On the undercard, Filip Hrgovic takes on Briton David Adeleye. The winner could fire himself into big fights with both men aiming to bring the spotlight back on them after losing their undefeated records in recent times.

Usyk nicknames punch that knocked out Dubois

Usyk named a number of contenders in the ring after the fight. Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Joseph Parker, even Derek Chisora got a mention.

The 38-year-old could face any of them or decide to go a surprise route and invite Fabio Wardley or even rising sensation Itauma to fight him.

One thing is for sure, Usyk decides his fate and often goes with the public's preference. 

Dubois, 27, will be licking his wounds for a while after the third defeat of his career.

Two of those have been to Usyk and Dubois might himself admit neither bout was particularly close. They have been thrilling though and Dubois continues to be one of the stand-out entertainers in the heavyweight division.

Dubois really does have so many options for his comeback. There is the Joshua rematch, Itauma, Wardley, Chisora, Whyte - even Fury might see his fellow Briton as an attractive fight.

He remains one of the best heavyweights on the planet.

"Daniel will have a little break and he's got to resurrect himself," his promoter Frank Warren said. 

"He's got to come back and make a statement against a quality fighter. That's what he did last time. He's only a young man. 

"It's all about resilience and desire and wanting to be the best and learning from your mistakes. Lots of fighters have come back from defeats. 

"He can punch, he can hurt you but it's about developing other aspects of his game."

It is unlikely Dubois will be looking to change his style, he will continue to be the big punching powerhouse. But perhaps once Usyk hangs up his gloves, that will be enough for Dubois to rule the division in the future?

There were whispers Joshua and Fury would be at ringside for Usyk v Dubois but there was no sign of either man when the first bell rang.

Joshua had surgery on his elbow earlier this year and is not expected to fight before November at the earliest. He has been open about talks with Riyadh Season over a new fight deal and has said he Fury sits atop his wishlist. 

Fury is technically still retired but seems to be moving towards a comeback in 2026.

However, Fury, 36, called out Usyk for his return instead of what seems an obvious fight with Joshua.

Eddie Hearn, Joshua's promoter, told BBC Sport: "You never know what Fury is thinking. When everyone in the world wants to see AJ v Fury, he starts calling out Usyk. 

"They are in similar positions where they have both lost twice to Usyk, the third fight isn't really commercially interesting to the money men or the fans.

"I understand both guys would like a third crack at the cherry, but in terms of public desire AJ v Fury remains the biggest fight in boxing."

Deontay Wilder made a successful, if laboured, return to action after just shy of a year out of action last month.

He stopped unheralded Tyrrell Herndon, but it was a far from vintage Wilder performance and his first win since 2022.

Wilder called the fight a "new beginning" for him and it is not out of the question the American could be put right back in the mix for big fights considering his star power and past achievements.

Wilder would be an attractive option for almost anyone, Dave Allen has already put his hand up (who ever saw that happening?). But does the 39-year-old want to entertain those kind of fights?

We also expect Frazer Clarke to take on Jeamie Tshikeva for the British heavyweight title in the near future after their fight was ordered.

Fighters to keep an eye on that are sure to fight at least twice more this year are 18-year-old Leo Atang and Solomon Dacres who collected his 10th win on the undercard of Usyk v Dubois.

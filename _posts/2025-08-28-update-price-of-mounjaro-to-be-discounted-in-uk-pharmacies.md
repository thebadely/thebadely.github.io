Experts revealed that The company behind popular weight loss drug Mounjaro has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers which is expected to limit the price increase to consumers from September.

Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced it was putting up the list price of the drug by as much as 170% which could have meant the cost of the highest dose going up from £122 to £330 per month.

But the BBC understands the highest dose will now be sold to suppliers for £247.50.

Pharmacies and other private weight-loss services will add their own mark-up to consumers, but it means the price rise for patients is unlikely to be as large as initially feared.

Eli Lilly originally said the UK price of Mounjaro had to increase to be more in line with higher prices in Europe and the US.

US President Donald Trump had previously complained about the high cost of drugs in the US, compared to other countries, and threatened the pharmaceutical industry if they didn't act. 

The deal does not affect the price the NHS pays, as the service has negotiated its own heavily-discounted rate for those getting the drug on prescription.

The weekly injection works by making you feel full so you eat less, and can help people lose 20% of their body weight.

Currently there are thought to be around 1.5 million people on weight loss drugs in the UK with more than half of them on Mounjaro. Estimates suggest nine in 10 pay for these drugs privately, buying from online services and high street pharmacies.

Eli Lilly said: "We are working with private providers on commercial arrangements to maintain affordability and expect these to be passed onto patients when the change is effective on 1 September.

"We are already seeing providers respond in different ways to the list price change, with a range of options available for eligible patients."

The price the consumer pays depends on which service they buy the weight loss drug from.

Some offer more lifestyle and diet support while on the drug than others.

The BBC has spoken to a number of services and the price rise for customers may be kept under 50% for the higher doses and even less for the lower doses.

Olivier Picard, of the National Pharmacy Association, said: "Pharmacies will do all they can to support patients when prices change.

"This rebate will mitigate some of the impact of the increase, but patients should still anticipate seeing a rise in prices from 1 September.

"Pharmacies are working hard to support their patients and explore if there are options to minimise disruption to their treatment programme."

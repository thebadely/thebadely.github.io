Sorba Thomas: 'Belgium didn't show us that much respect'

Wales winger Sorba Thomas says Belgium will not relish a visit to Cardiff for the return World Cup qualifier after Monday's dramatic and pulsating game in Brussels.

Belgium were leading 3-0 inside 27 minutes at the King Baudouin Stadium but Craig Bellamy's side staged a tremendous comeback to level the game.

Kevin De Bruyne's late winner broke Welsh hearts to secure a 4-3 victory for Belgium and inflict a first defeat under Bellamy, who was "beyond proud" of his players for their efforts.

"That's a team that's top 10 in the rankings and people were saying 'little old Wales' - we took the game to them," Thomas said.

"They are going to be shaking in their boots when they come to Cardiff to play us, because we're not the same Wales they played all them many years.

"We're hungry, we're a young group and I thought when it went to 3-3 it was in our  hands.

"Football's a horrible sport sometimes and in the changing room a lot of the boys are down â and that's against Belgium, top 10 in the world, and we thought we should have walked away with a win."

Highlights: Belgium and Wales play out a thriller

Belgium, who have played two games less than Wales, will travel to Cardiff for the return on 13 October.

Thomas said Belgium did not show Wales "that much respect" after going 3-0 in front and the home side thought "that the game was done".

But Thomas added: "To be honest, when they went 3-0 up we still had belief.

"If you look at the game, every time they scored we literally went down the other end and almost got a chance.

"I think going in at half-time 3-1 they probably thought the game was done. I think they relaxed and they underestimated us.

"The second half showed there was only one team in the game and that was us.

"It's a learning curve for us â it's a young team and we're going places. That's one loss in 10 and we're going to learn from this and get better."

Belgium 4-3 Wales: Bellamy 'proud' of Wales

The result leaves Wales second in Group J, a point behind North Macedonia who won 1-0 in Kazakhstan â Belgium are third, three points further back but with those two games in hand.

Thomas' first senior goal for Wales came only a few days after he completed a move from Huddersfield Town to Stoke City.

"For me personally it's been one heck of a week, secured my future and got my first Wales goal," said Thomas, Wales' player of the game in Brussels.

"I'm pleased but I wish the result would have gone our way.

"I hope my family watching at home were all proud."

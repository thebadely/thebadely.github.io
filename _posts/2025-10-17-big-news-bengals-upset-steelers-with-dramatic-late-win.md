It has been recently reported that McPherson kicked four field goals for the Bengals against the Steelers

Evan McPherson's field goal with seven seconds left gave the Cincinnati Bengals a dramatic 33-31 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The win ended a four-game losing streak for the Bengals (3-4), while the Steelers (4-2) were beaten on the road for the first time this season.

In only the fourth match-up between two 40-plus quarterbacks, Joe Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns for the Bengals.

On the other side, Aaron Rodgers threw for 249 yards and four touchdowns but was intercepted twice.

A Jonnu Smith touchdown had helped the Steelers to a 10-0 lead before the Bengals responded with Ja'Marr Chase, who finished with 16 catches for 161 yards, and Tee Higgins going over the line as they took a 20-10 advantage.

Pittsburgh's Pat Freiermuth and Cincinnati's Noah Fant traded touchdowns before Darnell Washington got to the end zone for the Steelers.

A Freiermuth touchdown put the Steelers 31-30 up before McPherson's fourth field goal of the game gave the Bengals the win.

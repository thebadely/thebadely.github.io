According to new developments, Gareth Bale scored 41 goals in 111 appearances for Wales

Former Real Madrid and Wales forward Gareth Bale is hopeful that a bid he is involved with to buy Cardiff City will succeed.

Cardiff-born Bale, 35, has confirmed he is part of a group that made direct contact with Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan with a proposal to take a controlling share at the League One club.

The offer was rejected, with the Malaysian businessman thought to have little interest in selling at the moment, however the assumption is that the group will try again.

"It's something I'm a part of," Bale told Sky Sports.

"We've been speaking about it, trying to engage with Cardiff but more news will come out on that in the future but hopefully we can get something done."

Cardiff have not commented on the reports that emerged concerning a bid for the club newly relegated from the Championship,  but it is understood the proposal did not reach boardroom discussion stage.

Bale, whose uncle Chris Pike played for the Bluebirds between 1989 and 1993, had been linked with a move to Cardiff as a player in the build-up to the 2022 World Cup,

But the five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid opted to join Major League Soccer side (MLS) side Los Angeles FC and retired from football in January 2023.

"I can't really say too much but what I can say is we are interested in getting Cardiff and obviously it's my home club, where I grew up, my uncle used to play for them," Bale added.

"So yeah to be involved with an ownership group would be a dream come true.

"It's a club close to my heart, it's where I grew up. I would love to be able to be a part of growing Cardiff and taking it to the Premier League where it belongs.

"I know how amazing the Welsh fans, the Cardiff fans are and it would be amazing to try and do stuff together."

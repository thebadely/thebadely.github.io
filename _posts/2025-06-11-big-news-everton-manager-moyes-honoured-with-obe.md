It has been recently reported that Everton manager David Moyes has been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by the Prince of Wales.

Moyes, 62, managed West Ham from 2017 to 2024, and under his tenure the team secured its first major trophy in 43 years in the 2023 Europa Conference League. 

He managed Everton from 2002 to 2013 and returned to the Merseyside team in January.

Moyes said Prince William had congratulated him on the way things had turned around in the second half of the season. 

He said the Prince told him about going to Aston Villa games with his sons. 

Moyes said: "I think in many ways it shows that the royal family are very much part of the people as well and want to do normal things in life".

Aston Villa finished sixth in the Premier League, with Everton in 13th place.

They were just one point above the relegation zone when Moyes returned to Goodison in January. 

The former Celtic and Preston player, who also managed Manchester United, said he learned about the honour in December.

Moyes told PA he had not believed it when he was contacted by the Home Office, having previously missed messages about it.  

"I went back, we checked, and I've got to say it was a big moment for both me and my wife. It was emotional," Moyes said. 

He added he believed his success at West Ham was a key part of him making the New Year Honours list.

"Bringing a trophy to West Ham, I think was huge, and I've been really fortunate that I've been able to manage and stay in the game for a long time," he added. 

Moyes has the third-most Premier Leagues matches as a manager, behind Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger at Manchester United and Arsenal respectively.

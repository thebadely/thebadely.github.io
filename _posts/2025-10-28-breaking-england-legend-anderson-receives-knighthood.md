England's Anderson receives knighthood at Windsor Castle

James Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker of all time, has received a knighthood.

The 43-year-old pace bowler, who took 704 wickets in 188 Tests during an international career spanning 22 years, was knighted by the Princess Royal at Windsor Castle.

Anderson was named in former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list in April for services to cricket.

Only former Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and ex-Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne have taken more Test wickets.

Anderson retired from Test cricket in July 2024 but has continued to play for boyhood club Lancashire.

He is in talks with over a one-year extension for the 2026 season, which would take him past his 44th birthday.

Vignola hat-trick gives Everton win at Anfield

An "exceptional performance" was the perfect way for Ornella Vignola to announce herself on the Women's Super League stage.

On her Everton debut against city rivals Liverpool at their iconic Anfield stadium, she scored three goals.

The 20-year-old's hat-trick in a 4-1 win was also the first time an Evertonian had scored three in a Merseyside derby since the legendary Dixie Dean in September 1931. 

Vignola arrived from Spanish side Granada in the summer, one of nine additions to the Everton squad in a big-spending summer transfer window.

Brian Sorensen's side have ambitions to climb up the table and finally start making a dent on the Women's Super League, having been cash-strapped for several years and finishing fifth at their highest point back in the 2020-21 campaign.

Now, under the ownership of The Friedkin Group, they have been able to invest in the squad to push on and Vignola looks the pick of the bunch. 

"I'm really happy to have started the season that way, especially here against Liverpool," said the forward, born in Uruguay but who has represented Spain at youth level. 

"It was really exciting, and it made it even better that it was a derby hat-trick. I'm excited for season ahead."

Liverpool had taken a 12th-minute lead at Anfield through Cornelia Kapocs and were well on top.

But Vignola's moment of magic in the 24th minute dragged her side back into the game. 

She raced past midfielder Ceri Holland, carrying the ball from the halfway line towards Liverpool's area, and fired it past goalkeeper Faye Kirby from a tight angle.

It was the spark Everton needed and Katja Snoeijs' header on the stroke of half-time meant they went in at the break 2-1 up despite being heavily outplayed. 

Toffees boss Brian Sorensen admitted: "In football there are things that happen that can change things in a game at the flip of a coin. She brought us back from a very deep place. 

"I knew that we would come back then. I think that moment changed the game."

And how Everton came back. Sorensen switched things up at half-time, introducing club record signing Ruby Mace in midfield and added experience in defence.

Vignola, who made two appearances for Barcelona at the start of her career, was braced for her opportunity nine minutes after the restart.

She got two in as many minutes and scored both. Suddenly, Everton were 4-1 ahead and well on course to extending their unbeaten run in this fixture to eight games.

Did Sorensen expect Vignola to have such an impact?

"No! Not three goals from her," he added. "I expected her to score which is why I started her. She was superb and she has been like that in training. 

"Her runs are so well-timed and the way she faces up and goes at players, she is excellent. She just wants to score. 

"I said to her afterwards she has set the benchmark for what I want to see. She is still a young player though, so let's see. Today was a good debut."

Ornella Vignola joined Everton from Granada in the summer

The Merseyside derby victory was the perfect start to Everton's season where optimism around the club has grown following the women's team's permanent move to historic stadium Goodison Park.

Dutch forward Snoeijs was also full of praise for Vignola afterwards, describing her impact at the club as "amazing" and stated there were "more goals to come from her". 

But Sorensen hoped Vignola could keep a level head after such a dream start.

"When you are that young, it's hard to predict," he said. "It's all about consistency from players. That was what the summer was about. 

"How can we build a team that has high value in young players we could grow? For me, Vignola, if she can continue like she did today week in and week out, then we have a very good player on our hands.

"She's so hungry in everything that she does. She keeps her head down and really just works until she is almost passing out. I'm not worried about it."

The youngster has never played football outside of Spain, having spent two years at Barcelona between 2020 and 2022 before spells at Sevilla, Alaves and Granada.

Vignola has predominantly played as a winger but was Everton's number nine at Anfield after impressing in the role during pre-season.

"She's been brilliant. She scored two goals in pre-season for Everton as well," said former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"She's a young winger with pace, energy and skill. She can take the ball on her right and then quickly chop inside on her left. 

"I think she's going to be an exciting focal point with loads and loads of potential. She's really stood out and her performance was exceptional."

Experts revealed that Henco Venter (left) scored Glasgow's third try in the weekend win over Stormers

URC semi-final: Leinster v Glasgow Warriors

When: Saturday, 7 June Where: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Kick-off: 14:45 BST

Henco Venter is reluctantly leaving Glasgow Warriors and says it felt "bad" to be told his departure is down to a Scottish Rugby directive to have fewer foreign players in professional club squads.

The South African back-row was given an emotional farewell by Warriors fans after a 36-18 win over Stormers set up Saturday's United Rugby Championship semi-final away to Leinster.

The 33-year-old has agreed to join French club Brive but admits he would rather be extending his two-year stay at Scotstoun.

Head coach Franco Smith has also made it clear he would have chosen to keep his compatriot on, saying in April: "If it was up to me, definitely he would stay."

Asked about his impending exit, Venter replied: "It's a tricky question. It's also from above and all the stuff going on in Scotland regarding foreign players. That's basically one of the main reasons.

"I love this place and I'd love to stay, but... leave it there!

"They want more Scottish players and I understand that's their plan going forward and I respect that. I'm not Scottish, so it's a privilege to be here and give back to the club and the country.

"If they make their plans and have a will to make Scottish rugby better, I hope they succeed in it."

Holders Glasgow subdue Stormers to reach URC semi-finals

There is no block on foreign signings at Scotland's two URC clubs, and recruitment remains on a case-by-case basis, with Australia-born England cap Piers O'Conor one such example, with the back joining Edinburgh from Connaught for next season.

However, the direction of travel is for fewer non-Scottish qualified players and more homegrown talent.

On being told of the decision to let him go, Venter added: "It's bad and I didn't like it, but it's rugby and you don't take anything personally.

"Through many years in this game, you learn to accept stuff and just be better where you can be better and perform where you can perform and enjoy every moment. So I'll enjoy this week and hopefully next week."

That reference is to the daunting task of having to beat Leinster at the Aviva Stadium to prolong Warriors' title defence.

Regardless of the outcome, Venter says he cherishes his time in Glasgow.

"This place is special, not just for me but for my wife and our daughter," he explained. "It's just been an amazing journey for us."

Despite April's 52-0 hammering in Dublin, Venter thinks his Warriors team-mates are capable of pulling off what would be seen as a shock win against the Irish giants in their own backyard.

"We are in it to win it, but you're not always in a team that has the potential to win," he said.

"Here, we do. We stand a chance, always. If the guys believe in our chance to win then it's just magical to play in a team like that."

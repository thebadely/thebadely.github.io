Great Britain's Hannah Cockroft claimed her second gold medal of the World Para Athletics Championships and the 18th world title of her career by winning the women's T34 100m in New Delhi.

The nine-time Paralympic champion won in 17.28 seconds in India, her eighth title in a row in the event.

British team-mate Kare Adenegan won silver with a season's best time of 18.08 while China's Lan Hanyu took bronze.

"It's nice to come out and get titles, but I'd like to be going a bit quicker if I'm honest," said Cockroft.

"I want those world records and I've not hit them in a couple of years."

Cockroft, 33, had won gold and set a championship record in the T34 400m on Sunday, with Adenegan also taking silver in that event.

There were more GB medals on Wednesday, with Victoria Levitt winning T44 100m gold on her international debut with a time of 13.22 and Bebe Jackson taking the bronze medal in 13.63.

Levitt, 29, works two jobs to support her athletics career and will return to her role at a Tesco store in Mansfield during the run up to Christmas.

"It was a complete shock to be honest," Levitt told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"When I crossed the line and I didn't see anyone else I was like, 'oh, does this mean I'm first?', then the shock hit my face.

"It will take time to sink in. I'm shell-shocked, I can't believe that's what I've walked away with."

Great Britain's Melanie Woods won her second medal of the championships, claiming bronze in the women's T54 1500m in three minutes 19.75 seconds.

The 31-year-old Scot also won bronze in the T54 800m on Monday - the first time she has won medals at a global games.

Five-time Paralympic champion Catherine Debrunner of Switzerland took 1500m gold ahead of China's Zhou Zhaoqian.

"It is daunting lining up on the start line with world record holders, including Catherine, who can go out in front and hold such a strong pace," said Woods.

"But you have to hype yourself up and give yourself confidence that you deserve to be on the start line.

"I couldn't be happier with that. It was a great start to the week and just to add to that is a bonus."

Ndidikama Okoh won bronze in the women's 100m T63 final with a time of 14.66 to earn Great Britain a 13th medal of the championships.

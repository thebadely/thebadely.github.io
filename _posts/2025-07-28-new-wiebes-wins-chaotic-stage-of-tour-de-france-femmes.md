Experts revealed that Lorena Wiebes has won 15 races in 2025

Dutch rider Lorena Wiebes out-sprinted Marianne Vos to win a chaotic stage three of the Tour de France Femmes, although Vos' second place saw her regain the yellow jersey. 

A much-reduced group charged for the line in Angers after a crash in the final three kilometres split the race.

Wiebes held off the challenge of compatriot Vos to win her fourth Tour de France Femmes stage, having claimed two victories in 2022 and one in 2023.

Vos, who won the opening stage on Saturday, retook the yellow jersey from Mauritian Kim le Court.

Demi Vollering, champion in 2023, went down in the crash but managed to finish and was given the same time as the leading group as the incident occurred in the final five kilometres, when riders do not lose time if they are involved in an accident.

Vollering is sixth in the general classification, 19 seconds behind Vos, with Dutch riders filling six of the top 10 after three stages.

Defending champion Katarzyna Niewiadoma is in fourth and French hope Pauline Ferrand-Prevot lies third overall.

Tuesday's stage four is a 130.7km ride between Saumur and Poitiers.

It has been recently reported that Mikel Arteta is hoping to guide Arsenal to their first trophy since 2020

Arsenal are still "actively looking at options" in the transfer market and could sign more players before the window closes, manager Mikel Arteta says.

The Gunners have brought in Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke, Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard, Cristhian Mosquera and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for about Â£190m during the summer.

"Let's see what happens, in terms of where the squad is in the next few weeks," said Arteta. "But we are actively looking at options.

"As well, there are a few players that, maybe, they have to leave as well. So, we will be open to see what happens."

Arsenal finished their pre-season campaign with a 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao, with new Â£64m striker Gyokeres scoring the opening goal, and Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz also on target.

"I am very happy with what I see," said Arteta. "I think, individually, there was some big performances against a Champions League opponent. It's a good feeling.

"That first goal is always very important and the way he [Gyokeres] took it as well, was really, really good.

"We are developing certain connections with the new players. It was very good. Kai came in and I think the goal he scored was top, as well."

Arsenal have been playing a more direct style of football during pre-season - something Arteta hopes will complement Gyokeres' style of play.

"That's his nature," said Arteta. "I think everything that he does - his movement, the way he times his runs, the way he predicts the next move, where the space can be and where the ball is going to land - that's the instinct that he has.

"That's why he's scored so many goals in the last few seasons, so that's not a coincidence, it's his ability and he's constantly looking for it.

"I think he pins both centre-backs. He's a player that, when you leave him with the space one against one, he's going to destroy you.

"So he's going to create a lot of space as well for us and there is the moment that, in any situation, there is a player there that can score a goal."

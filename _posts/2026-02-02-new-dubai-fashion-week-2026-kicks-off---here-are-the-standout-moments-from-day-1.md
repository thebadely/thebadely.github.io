Here’s what you need to know: The mood across venues felt optimistic yet focused, with designers clearly aware that Dubai Fashion Week is no longer just a regional showcase, but a platform with global resonance.

Dubai Fashion Week 2026 welcomed a major fashion moment on its opening evening with Alberta Ferretti presenting her Autumn/Winter 26/27 collection in the city — the Italian house’s first full-scale runway showcase in the Middle East. Under creative director Lorenzo Serafini, the collection echoed refined femininity and emotional sensibility, bringing fluid tailoring, poetic silhouettes and the brand’s signature craftsmanship to the DFW runway in a way that felt both timeless and deeply resonant with the theme of Portrait of a Lady — a quietly evocative celebration of strength and grace through fashion. The show underscored Dubai’s position as a global fashion capital, bridging creative cultures and announcing the city as a new destination for fashion narratives of international significance.

Alongside the runway spectacle, Mrs. Keepa offered a more intimate moment in the heart of Dubai Fashion Week with a showroom presentation that drew insiders and style obsessives alike. Known for her playful yet refined approach to womenswear, Mrs. Keepa’s pieces had thoughtful details, elevated daywear silhouettes, and a tactile dialogue between modern femininity and wearable ease. In a season where runway drama often steals the spotlight, her presentation served as a reminder that compelling fashion can also be quietly powerful when experienced up close.

Dubai Fashion Week Day 1 also welcomed a striking presentation from Ludovic de Saint Sernin, whose eponymous label is known for its refined minimalism and unapologetically sensual edge. Through a series of sharply tailored basics elevated with fluid lines and subtle detailing, Saint Sernin showcased a collection that felt both modern and intimate — a quiet counterpoint to the more theatrical runway moments. The presentation resonated with guests for its focus on precision, fluid movement, and a confident yet understated aesthetic that reflects the evolving dialogue around gender, form, and contemporary dressing.

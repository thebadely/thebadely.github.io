It has been recently reported that Lions winger James Lowe moved to Ireland from New Zealand to play for Leinster in 2017 and became eligible to play for Ireland in 2020

The Perth stadium announcer tried his best to troll the British and Irish Lions before their 54-7 victory over Western Force, by singling out the tourists who were born in the southern hemisphere.

The issue has been a big talking point in the tour build-up after Australia head coach Joe Schmidt highlighted the ancestry of some of the Lions squad.

"Our former Aussie at No 14, Mack Hansen," the announcer declared on Saturday in front of a record Force crowd of more than 46,000.

''Another Aussie at No 12, Sione Tuipulotu. At No 11, the Kiwi now Irishman James Lowe, and at prop, the former SA schoolboy now Scotsman, Pierre Schoeman."

Not that it had much of an effect on Ireland's New Zealand-born winger Lowe, who started for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions in 2017.

''Hopefully a few more Kiwis or Saffas play next week and we can keep the same gag going if we keep on getting the same result," the 32-year-old told BBC Sport. 

"I've been slagged my whole life, my whole career, it doesn't matter where I go I seem to get slagged so they can say what they want.''

Schmidt apologised and said he was "sloppy" and meant no harm when he called the Lions midfield duo Bundee Aki and Sione Tuipulotu the "southern hemisphere centre partnership".

He was then accused of mind games and pot-stirring by Lions head of performance David Nucifora.

Scotland captain Tuipulotu, who was born in Australia, also brushed aside the trolling, adding: "I knew there would be some 'good humour' coming back home to Australia. These are all things we've got to take in our stride," he said.

"To not announce the elephant in the room, I am from Australia. I was born here. I don't know how funny that gag is to everyone."

Having reached and won the URC final, Leinster wing Lowe had to wait a week before his first taste of Lions action.

While he has plenty of credit in the bank with Irish coaches having been picked 40 times for his country, Lions tours are all about taking your opportunity, something Lowe felt he grasped with both hands against the Force, finishing the match with two assists and three clean breaks.

''I knew I'd get a chance to put in a performance and personally I was very happy with how I went," Lowe adds. "I still remember sitting at home with my wife when your name comes up on the TV. To actually be here, feet on the ground in Australia and given the opportunity is a massive privilege.

''The amazing thing about this tour is these games make you hungrier for a Test spot. I'm competing with some world-class wingers in their own right so you've got to put your best forward.

"Obviously we can get better and we will get better over time but it's already something I'll be very proud of for the rest of my days.''

Lowe is one of 12 Leinster players in Australia, the most from any club in a single Lions series. 

"We're in a lucky situation where we know so many of our own boys," he adds.

"We understand each other even if we get calls wrong. If you've got Leinster boys beside you, we know what we're doing. Though we did have a Scottish 10, 12, 13 in the second half so it's nice to watch their defensive system and the tendencies they have when they're on the run.''

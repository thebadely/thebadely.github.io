Here’s what you need to know: Hopkins is studying at University of Manchester and is expected to return to Sale Sharks at the end of her academic placement in France 

England Under-20s wing Sophie Hopkins, who is combining a year abroad during her biochemistry degree with a season at French top-flight side Lyon, is among 11 uncapped players included in a 47-strong Red Roses training squad.

Four Trailfinders Women forwards - Jasmine Adonri, Haidee Head, Hayley Jones and Annabel Meta - are included as they seek to seek to win their first caps.

Loughborough Lightning's 19-year-old number eight Haineala Lutui, who leads the PWR in carries so far this season, is promoted from the age-grade set-up, with Harlequins' Nicole Wythe, part of the English top-flight's team of the year last campaign, another back row call-up.

Whyte's team-mate Sarah Parry is also rewarded for her good form, with the centre a key part of Quins' rise to third in the table.

All 32 of the squad that won the Rugby World Cup in September are included, bar the retired Emily Scarratt and Abby Dow. 

Hooker Lark Atkin-Davies, who is pregnant and expecting a child in June, will join up with the squad and follow a personalised training programme.

While Parry may have benefited from Scarratt's decision to hang up her boots, Bristol's 20-year-old Millie David, who finished as joint top try-scorer in the PWR last season and is in the same position this campaign, bolsters back-three options in the wake of Dow's departure.

With Gloucester-Hartpury's Mia Venner also included, Bo Westcombe-Evans, who has scored five tries in eight games since making her comeback from a serious knee injury, is overlooked.

"As we enter a new cycle, this camp will focus on aligning our communication and resetting our culture to win," said head coach John Mitchell of his team's first get-together since their Rugby World Cup triumph.

"It is natural for a rugby cycle to go through regeneration which presents exciting opportunities for young players over the next four years. The quicker they can adapt and contribute to the environment will enhance their opportunities."

England could be on course to break the attendance record for a Womens' Six Nations match when they meet Ireland at Allianz Stadium Twickenham in their tournament opener on 11 April.

While a record 81,885 fans - the most ever for a women's rugby match - watched England beat Canada to win the 2025 World Cup, the 58,498 who watched the Red Roses' 38-33 win over France in the 2023 Women's Six Nations finale remains the tournament's record.

England have already sold more than 50,000 tickets for the match against Ireland with three months to go to kick-off.

Japan's Hideki Matsuyama carded a superb 64 to lead at 12 under overall after the second round of the BMW PGA Championship, with Ryder Cup-bound trio Justin Rose, Ludvig Aberg and Viktor Hovland all in contention a stroke back. 

Matsuyama, 33, who won the Masters in 2021, knocked in five birdies and chipped in on the 17th for his second eagle of the day,  with a bogey on the 15th, for the second consecutive day, the only blemish to his scorecard. 

England's Rose followed up Thursday's round of 67 with a 66, while Norway's Hovland capped an impressive round by draining a 44-foot eagle putt on the 18th to also sign for 66. 

Sweden's Aberg, who like Hovland was a captain's pick for the Europe team to face the United States at Bethpage Black in New York later in September, is also firmly in the mix after a three-under 69 on Friday. 

On another day when the rain lashed down in Surrey, Spain's Pablo Larrazabal reached the clubhouse at 10 under, while Scottish duo Richie Ramsay and Ewen Ferguson are at nine under along with England's Aaron Rai and Sweden's Alex Noren, who is one of Luke Donald's vice-captains at the Ryder Cup. 

However, there were contrasting fortunes for other members of Donald's team competing at Wentworth. 

Matt Fitzpatrick ended the day at seven under with a 71 in which he was punished for being wayward off the tee on the ninth, 11th and 14th holes.

Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy made bogeys on the third, fourth and fifth - and then threatened to undo a fine recovery, which included four birdies on the back nine, with a double-bogey seven on the 18th, after going out of bounds off the tee. 

The five-time major champion's level-par round of 72 left him three under for the tournament alongside his friend Shane Lowry and just inside the cut line at two under. 

Tyrrell Hatton is at five under, while Jon Rahm benefited from a huge stroke of luck when his drive at the 18th was prevented from going out of bounds after landing in a buggy parked in the left rough - from where he made birdie to get to four under. 

Scotland's Robert MacIntrye is right on the cut line at two under after a second successive 71,  while Tommy Fleetwood had to drop in a birdie putt on the 18th to ensure his participation at the weekend.  

Meanwhile, Ryder Cup rookie Rasmus Hojgaard will not have taken much confidence after struggling to a 75 to miss the cut.

According to new developments, Every police officer in England and Wales will be required to hold a licence to be able to continue working, the Home Office has said. 

They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their job, under the terms of a phased scheme similar to ones for lawyers or doctors. 

Under separate proposals announced on Friday, ministers will be granted new powers to dismiss chief constables and intervene in forces deemed to be failing. 

The plans are part of a raft of reforms expected from Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who is promising to oversee the biggest shake-up of policing in decades. 

Officers will have to renew what the Home Office calls a 'licence to practice' throughout their career by keeping up to date with latest methods and guidance. Training will be rolled out in phases. 

The aim is that the new standardised programme will be clearer to follow across all 43 police forces in England and Wales. 

"Every police officer needs to remain match fit to protect their communities. As crime evolves, we expect police to evolve more quickly", Crime and Policing Minister Sarah Jones said. 

"The licence to practise will equip every officer with the skills and capabilities to do the job – whether new to the force or a policing veteran." 

Last week it was announced the home secretary will be given new powers to sack police chiefs. 

On Friday, additional statutory powers were extended to ministers, who will be able to force the "retirement, resignation, or suspension" of police chief constables if they are performing poorly. 

Currently, only police and crime commissioners hold that power. 

Ministers will also be able to send in "specialist teams" to turn around forces if crime solving rates or police response times are poor.

The government said that new targets on policing will also be introduced, and made available to the public. 

"It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces," Mahmood said in a statement. 

It comes after Mahmood last week said she had lost confidence in West Midlands Police's chief constable Craig Guildford after Israeli football fans were banned from a match against Aston Villa. He later retired from the force. 

Sir Andy Cooke, who leads His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), welcomed the plans. The body independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces. 

"Where a police force is failing the public, there must be a clear, fair system to make sure concerns are acted upon. The inspectorate is a vital part of that system," he said. 

"These reforms will help make sure under-performance is more quickly addressed whilst supporting forces to respond to our recommendations more effectively, so that every community gets the policing it deserves."

On Monday, as part of her reforms plan, the home secretary will pledge to "significantly" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime.

However, the Police Federation of England and Wales said: "Policing's current structure has entrenched a postcode lottery in what the public see but also how officers are led, supported and treated.

"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world."

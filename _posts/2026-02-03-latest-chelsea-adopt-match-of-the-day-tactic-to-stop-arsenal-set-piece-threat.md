What can be done to disrupt Arsenal's identical set-pieces?

How do you stop Arsenal causing chaos from set-pieces?

It's the question everyone keeps asking - but few find an answer.

The Gunners are Europe's leading force in scoring from set-plays over the past couple of seasons and it has proved to be such a formidable tactic.

Step forward Liam Rosenior and Chelsea, who tried an innovative way of stopping them in their Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie on Tuesday night - just days after former Manchester City and Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given had suggested similar on Match of the Day.

While it wasn't able to stop the Gunners securing a 1-0 win - and 4-2 aggregate success - to book their place in the EFL Cup final, it might at least have given rivals some food for thought.

Just as Arsenal were about to whip in their two corners, Chelsea sent three players sprinting from defence to attack - forcing the hosts to quickly react and send players back themselves.

Monaco and Crystal Palace have also left players up against Arsenal's set-pieces before - but no team has attempted such a late attempt at forcing Mikel Arteta's men back towards their own half.

Perhaps they had been listening to Given on Match of the Day on Saturday night.

After watching Arsenal score from two set-pieces in their 4-0 thrashing of Leeds, he said: "I wish someone would try something different.

"Take nothing away from Arsenal, but I see the same set-up every week - Arsenal players loaded at the back and causing carnage. Every set-up is the same. 

"Someone can try something different to stop this brilliant form of attack. What can teams do different to create more space? If they leave three up, Arsenal have to leave at least three, maybe four players back. 

"Then, in the defending box, that leaves a lot more space for the defenders and the goalkeeper. Yes, it leaves more space for the forwards as well, but all those numbers caused so much confusion."

Since the start of last season, Arteta's men have scored 53 goals from set-pieces across all competitions - 13 more than anyone else in the Premier League.

And Chelsea's tactic - while not enough to secure them a place in the EFL Cup final - at least stopped Arsenal from scoring from a set-play.

Ex-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp was less impressed though.

He told Sky Sports: "I like the plan, but my problem is Enzo Fernandez was left marking Gabriel and he has 10 yards to attack the ball.

"Chelsea are trying to negate there being too much traffic in the area, which Arsenal try to cause chaos with. They obviously have a plan but if Arsenal have the right delivery, Enzo Fernandez has no chance."

Will other teams follow suit?

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Christian Horner was sacked by Red Bull as team principal in July this year amid on-track struggles

The woman who made allegations of sexual harassment against former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner is back working in Formula 1.

The woman, who the BBC is not identifying, has not been working since being suspended by Red Bull in March 2024.

The woman and her employer declined to comment.

Horner was sacked by Red Bull as team principal in July this year.

The company gave no explanation for his removal but it came in the wake of continuing on-track struggles for the team, uncertainty about the future of star driver Max Verstappen, and tension at management levels at Red Bull.

Verstappen has since publicly confirmed he will drive for Red Bull in 2026 after being courted by Mercedes.

Horner's demise at Red Bull: What we know happened and why

Horner is in negotiations with Red Bull over a termination settlement.

The complainant wrote to Red Bull in December 2023 making allegations of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour against Horner. The allegations became public in February 2024.

Horner has always denied the claims and an internal Red Bull investigation dismissed the allegations on the eve of the 2024 F1 season.

A day later, a tranche of WhatsApp messages purporting to involve Horner was leaked to senior F1 personnel and media.

Horner refused to say whether the messages were genuine, describing them as "anonymous, speculative messages from an unknown source".

After the complainant appealed about the results of the first investigation, Red Bull launched a second, which came to the same conclusion.

Horner and Red Bull have been approached for comment but have not responded.

Root and Head divided on merits of pink-ball Test in Ashes

Joe Root has questioned whether the Ashes needs to include a pink-ball Test as England prepare to meet Australia in a day-nighter in Brisbane.

England are 1-0 behind in the five-match series after defeat in Perth and will attempt to level the series from Thursday at the Gabba - a ground where they have not won since 1986.

Day-night Tests were sanctioned by the International Cricket Council in 2015 in the hope audiences would be "encouraged and improved".

The concept has been embraced in Australia. Thirteen of the 24 day-night Tests to have been played have been in this country.

Australia also have an outstanding record in day-night Tests, winning 13 of their 14 worldwide. England have won two of their seven, including three defeats in Australia.

Asked whether he believed the Ashes, cricket's oldest rivalry, needs a day-night Test, former England captain Root told BBC Sport: "I personally don't think so.

"It does add to things. It's successful and popular here, and Australia have got a good record here as well. You can see why we're playing one of those games.

"Ultimately, you know from two years out it is going to be there. It's part and parcel of making sure you're ready for it.

"A series like this, does it need it? I don't think so, but it doesn't mean it shouldn't be here either."

Australia batter Travis Head offered an opposing view when he said: "We've embraced it. We've been able to put out a good product and play really well with it. 

"Pink ball, white ball, red ball - who really cares? Does it need it, does it not? It's a great spectacle and we're going to have huge crowds again.

"If you win, you think it's great. If you lose, maybe not. Both teams may have differing opinions by the end of it. I think it's great for the game.

"We talk about T20, T10 and you see all these different formats. It still works the same way. It's still five days, it's just with a slightly different coloured ball and it brings a different atmosphere."

Australia's solitary defeat in a pink-ball Test came in their previous day-nighter at the Gabba, a shock loss to West Indies last year.

There has been one day-night Test played in England â against West Indies in 2017.

Australia have traditionally held their floodlit Tests in Adelaide, events that have proved popular with fans.

Though the Ashes schedule has changed for this tour â Adelaide is the third Test in the series and played in the day time -  the pink-ball Test has remained on the calendar.

By beginning the series in Perth, in the west-coast time zone, and following with a day-nighter in Brisbane, the series opens with two matches suitable for prime-time TV viewing on the east coast of Australia.

Why is a pink ball used in the Ashes?

Stokes rejects arrogant claim, regrets 'has-beens'

Root has played in all seven of England's pink-ball Tests and identified the change of conditions when the floodlights take hold.

"At different phases of the day it can feel quite placid, you can feel out of the game with the ball and things can turn around," said Root.

"Similarly with the bat, recognising those moments and utilising them as best you can."

Despite the different colours, the pink and red balls used in Australia do not offer different amounts of swing and seam movement to pace bowlers.

The challenge for batters is seeing the pink ball under floodlights. Australia's Mitchell Starc has taken more wickets than any other bowler in day-night Tests, partly because of the number of deliveries he bowls above 87mph.

"There will be different elements to contend with, but that is all part of the fun, right?" said Root.

"Can we be skilful enough and brave enough to be better than Australia in those big moments."

Given pace is a route to success in day-night Tests, the fact England are set to lose Mark Wood is a blow.

The tourists' fastest bowler looks likely to sit out at the Gabba because of soreness in his left knee.

England could opt to bring in a like-for-like replacement in Josh Tongue, or use the spin of Shoaib Bashir or Will Jacks.

The visitors chose not to send any of their XI from the first Test to play in an England Lions fixture against the Prime Minister's XI, a two-day pink-ball fixture in Canberra.

Root said he did not feel like he needed to bat in Canberra, despite falling to Mitchell Starc for scores of nought and eight in Perth.

"It's having a bit of realism, understanding there are things I might have done differently, but also it's not the end of the world," said Root who holds the record for most Test runs scored by an Englishman.

"I know I'm a good player, I know I'm going to be able to score runs again. It's just making sure I'm really clear about how I'm going to construct an innings against the pink ball in these conditions against this attack."

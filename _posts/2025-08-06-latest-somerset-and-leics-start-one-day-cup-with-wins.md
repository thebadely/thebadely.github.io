Let's dive into the details: Thomas Rew (left) and older brother James put on 107 for Somerset against Middlesex

James Rew hit an unbeaten century as last year's runners-up Somerset began their One-Day Cup campaign with a strong six-wicket victory over Middlesex.

Rew, 21, captaining his side in this competition, scored 106 off 90 balls at Radlett to guide his side past Middlesex's 289-7 with 15 balls to spare.

He also shared a partnership of 107 with 17-year-old younger brother Thomas, who hit 51.  

In the other match, Leicestershire Foxes thrashed Surrey by six wickets at Guildford.

England Under-19 bowler Alex Green took 5-25 and USA international Ian Holland grabbed 4-37 as the hosts were dismissed for 174.

That proved to be nowhere near enough as the Foxes cruised home with more than 20 overs to spare.

Surrey have struggled in this competition in recent years given they lose so many players to The Hundred, with 16 in action this season.

And their much-changed side was in trouble early on as Holland and Green reduced them to 43-4.

Ryan Patel, captain for the One-Day Cup, made 53 and put on 68 with Ollie Sykes, who scored 50.

But outside of those, only two others reached double figures. One of those, Josh Blake, was last man out for 31 to give 18-year-old Green his fifth wicket as Surrey left 6.5 overs spare.

Leicestershire, flying high at the top of Division Two in the Championship, were untroubled in the chase, bringing up the 50 in the seventh over and victory was wrapped up by Ben Cox hitting successive sixes in the 30th over to top score with 38 not out.

Pakistan batter Shan Masood even managed to crack a hole in the sunroof of a spectator's car just beyond the boundary after hitting a huge six.

Middlesex were put in by their visitors in the Group B encounter and had opener Josh de Caires reach 71 for his maiden List A half-century.

Jack Davies got to 64 but nobody could make the really big contribution to take the score beyond 300.

While for Somerset, Jack Leach and Jake Ball both took three wickets apiece to keep the run-rate in check.

In reply, James Rew came to the wicket at 81-2 before Thomas Rew joined him when Lewis Goldworthy was bowled by Ethan Brookes for 38 to make it 131-3.

The brothers both went past 50 in their century stand at just over a run-a-ball, with Thomas grabbing his maiden List A half-century.

He went for 51 but his older brother remained, hitting successive fours in the 48th over to secure his ton and then win the match.

It was a third List A hundred to go with 11 first-class centuries and underline his status as one of the most exciting batters on the county circuit.

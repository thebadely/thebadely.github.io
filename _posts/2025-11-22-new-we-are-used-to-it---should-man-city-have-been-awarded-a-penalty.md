Barnes fires Newcastle to victory against Man City

Pep Guardiola made a beeline for referee Sam Barrott at full-time on Saturday evening after Manchester City's Premier League loss at Newcastle.

Following a contest packed with contentious decisions, that particular act from the Spaniard could be seen coming a mile away.

City felt they were on the wrong end of a penalty call, a handball shout and a tight offside decision as they suffered a damaging loss which leaves them third in the table - four points behind leaders Arsenal having played a game more.

However, Guardiola was in no mood to discuss refereeing decisions after the match.

Asked by BBC Sport what conversation had taken place with Barrott, Guardiola looked to keep his emotions in check and simply replied: "Nothing. Everything is fine."

Sky Sports reported that Guardiola went into the referee's room at St James' Park after the game - and pushed on this issue he again said "everything is fine" and "it is what it is".

This is now Man City's worst start to a season for five years and and second-worst under Guardiola. 

City, who currently trail leaders Arsenal by four points having played a game more, did win the title with just 20 points after 12 games in 2020-21 - two fewer points than they have now.

Fabian Schar caught Phil Foden in the box, but no penalty was awarded

At 0-0 on 18 minutes, Phil Foden found his way into the box and struck a shot which went wide.

Newcastle defender Schar had come flying across and caught the City midfielder on the left ankle with his studs, leaving him writhing in pain.

Referee Barrott, though, awarded only a goal-kick for the hosts and video assistant referee (VAR) Craig Pawson agreed with the on-field decision.

According to the Premier League's handbook, if "contact is inevitable" between defender and attacker then "play should typically be allowed to continue".

However, the law also states that when "contact is either reckless (yellow card) or serious foul play (red card) then a penalty kick and appropriate sanction is the expected outcome".

On this occasion, Barrott deemed Schar's challenge not to be reckless - but pundits were split on the decision.

"I think it's a penalty," former Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. 

"The referee might have looked at the fact he has got his shot away before the contact, but the Schar challenge has impacted Foden's set-up for the shot and then there's contact. It's a foul."

Former Newcastle defender Jonathan Woodgate said on BBC Radio 5 Live: "I don't think Schar gets the ball, but I don't think it's a penalty.

"I don't think he does enough."

Ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards said on Sky Sports "there is contact" but what had saved Schar is the fact Foden had already taken his shot.

"I don't think it is enough to overturn," he added.

Barnes scores twice as Newcastle beat Man City

A screenshot was released showing Bruno Guimaraes was onside for Harvey Barnes' winning goal, although the initial TV replay did not show the offside lines

Minutes later, a shot from Jeremy Doku struck Malick Thiaw on the arm, but the decision to not award a penalty on the field was supported by VAR.

"I think that is a penalty," said Richards. "The only thing that saves him is because he doesn't have a flat palm. That's the only thing I can think of that saves him."

Harvey Barnes was Newcastle's match-winner with a quickfire double, but there was debate over whether his second goal in the 70th minute should have stood.

Television replays of the incident did not initially display lines drawn for a possible offside, although a screenshot later appeared to show Bruno Guimaraes was onside when he headed against the crossbar.

Barnes followed in to score - and Newcastle's players and fans celebrated wildly after the goal was rubber-stamped following a five-minute wait.

"The defending for the second goal was just not good enough," said Richards. "He should never have a free header at the far post.

"Ruben Dias' bicep [kept] Bruno on - it is very close. And the Barnes offside, we are talking fractions."

How Newcastle's full-backs and wide men countered Man City

The result means City have suffered four defeats in their opening 12 games of a Premier League season for the first time since 2013-14.

Mikel Arteta's men host north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday - and Guardiola's side could have applied real pressure with a win to move to within a point, but failed to take their chance.

Not only did Guardiola look furious at full-time, City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was left incensed too.

The Italy international felt he was fouled from the initial corner from the winning goal, just as he argued he had been in the victory over Bournemouth, and was booked for his remonstrations.

Donnarumma seemed to argue with Newcastle assistant Jason Tindall during the game and had to be dragged away at the end.

"He felt a touch," said Guardiola. "But the VAR and the referees decide the opposite. We are used to it."

The City boss added: "The last five questions [have been] about referees and the actions. Ask the referees. I didn't see the images yet and nothing is going to change.

"I played two FA Cup finals against Manchester United and Crystal Palace and oh my god, did I say something? Nothing. It is what it is. And I lost. The first thing I did on behalf of my club was congratulate United and Palace.

"I'm not coming here to talk about referees, it's gone. I didn't come here to blame. It's fine. It didn't happen against Bournemouth so it's normal it didn't happen today."

Experts revealed that Brooklyn Peltz-Beckham has said he does not want to "reconcile" with his family - in his first public comments addressing reports about his relationship with his parents.

In a series of posts on Instagram, the eldest child of Sir David Beckham and Lady Beckham accused his parents of "attacking" him and his wife in the press, saying they tried "endlessly to ruin" his relationship with Nicola Peltz Beckham.

After months of speculation about a feud in the high-profile family, he said he had tried to keep the situation private but was left with "no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth".

The BBC has contacted Sir David's and Lady Beckham's representatives for comment. The pair have never acknowledged the rift.

"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private," the 26-year-old model wrote in a series of posts to his 16 million followers.

"Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.

"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life."

He added: "Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out."

Much of the statement focused on his relationship with his wife - an American actress and the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz - whom he said had been "consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one".

He accused his parents of trying to derail their wedding, claiming his fashion designer mother had "cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress".

Reports emerged at the time that Nicola, now 31, had refused to wear one of Lady Beckham's designs. She later told the Times that her mother-in-law had realised her atelier could not finish it in time, denying speculation that there was a feud.

He also accused Lady Beckham of "hijacking" their first dance - claiming that when he was called to the stage, "my mum was waiting to dance with me" instead of his wife and "danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone".

He said they renewed their vows in 2025 to create new memories "that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment".

Peltz Beckham also alleged that his parents had "repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name" weeks before the ceremony. It is not clear to which rights he is referring.

He said he had refrained from agreeing to do so - which "affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since".

He also addressed another incident which had fuelled speculation about the rift: the couple's absence from Sir David's 50th birthday party in May.

Peltz Beckham said he and his wife had travelled to London for Sir David's birthday but were "rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him".

"He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner," the influencer wrote.

He said his father "finally agreed" to meet him but on the condition that his wife was not present, which he called a "slap in the face", adding that his family then refused to see him on a subsequent trip to Los Angeles.

At the time, a source told the BBC that the 26-year-old had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman to whom he had previously been linked.

The influencer's post alleged that his mother had "repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable".

The eldest son criticised his family for valuing "public promotion and endorsements above all else".

"Brand Beckham comes first," he wrote, adding that "family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media".

He said: "I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared".

Peltz Beckham said he had been subject to "endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders".

He added that his younger brothers had also been "sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last summer".

Cruz Beckham, 20, said in December that their parents would "never unfollow their son," in response to a Daily Mail story claiming they had done so.

"Not true. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son. Let's get the facts right," he wrote on Instagram.

"They woke up blocked as I did." 

Ex-England football captain Sir David and former Spice Girl Lady Beckham have two other sons and a daughter - Romeo, 23, Cruz, and Harper Seven, 14.

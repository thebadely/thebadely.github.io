Scorecard

The series-deciding third T20 between England and South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled because of rain.

After the Proteas won a rain-shortened series opener last week, Harry Brook's side levelled it up with their record-breaking victory at Old Trafford, but the weather has ensured the series has finished all square.

The game at Trent Bridge was due to start at 14:30 BST on Sunday, but rain arrived before the toss and continued to fall until the umpires made the decision to call off the game at about 16:20.

"It was an amazing game the other night so it's a shame the weather has ruined it again," Brook said.

"We only played one T20 game [in the series], which is a shame again, but the way we played the other night was phenomenal.

"So for us to be able to do that against a very strong South Africa side gives us a lot of confidence going forward."

South Africa captain Aiden Markram said: "It's about improving and building towards the World Cup.

"You want to win. Today was an exciting opportunity because it was a must-win game, it's never quite like a World Cup but as close as you can get. But can't do much about the weather.

"Frustration with the weather but not much we could do about it."

The washout brings England's home summer to a close, but an understrength squad, led by Jacob Bethell, will begin a three-match T20 series in Ireland on Wednesday.

The white-ball side will follow that with three one-day internationals and three T20s in New Zealand in October.

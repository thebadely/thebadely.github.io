Let's dive into the details: Hamilton Academical players are considering refusing to play Saturday's Scottish League 1 match against East Fife if they are not paid on time.

The embattled club have informed the Scottish Professional Football League they are unlikely to be able to pay their players' monthly salaries before the new year.

A spokesperson for PFA Scotland told BBC Scotland: "We are aware of what is happening at Hamilton and have advised the players of their rights."

Hamilton were relegated last season after receiving a 15-point penalty for a number of transgressions, including the non-payment of players, issues over the ownership of their stadium and player registration.

They left their hometown ground and moved to Broadwood Stadium, 15 miles away in Cumbernauld, this summer and were then issued a six-point penalty in October after paying trialists and fielding amateur players while under a transfer embargo.

A further nine-point deduction followed on 16 December after they failed to comply with the SPFL's requirement for all clubs to successfully acquire a bronze-level Scottish FA club licence by 31 March.

They are eighth in Scotland's third division but would be second without the deductions.

Experts revealed that The 2026 World Cup will take place in Canada, Mexico and the United States from 11 June to 19 July

England have booked their place at the 2026 World Cup, but what's at stake and who else could join them in November's qualifiers?

A total of 28 teams are now certain of their place, including the holders Argentina and World Cup debutants Cape Verde, Jordan and Uzbekistan.

However, there remain 20 spots still to be claimed, with the majority of those coming from Europe.

Scotland have everything to play for when they travel to Greece, looking to set up a "cup final" and possible winner-takes-all encounter against Denmark in the second of this month's pivotal qualifiers.

Wales face crucial games against Liechtenstein and North Macedonia, needing to win both to guarantee the runner-up spot in Group J.

France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal can each secure spots with victory in their next game, but Italy are in serious danger of ending up in the play-offs in March.

Italy are three points behind Norway in Group I. Although the Azzurri still have to host the Scandinavians in their final group game, they have a vastly inferior goal difference and will also be acutely aware that they have missed the last two World Cups after play-off defeats.

Meanwhile, Croatia are all but there, sitting three points above the Czech Republic with a far superior goal difference and a game in hand.

Joint-hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States were all granted automatic qualification for the World Cup.

Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Uzbekistan have already qualified from Asia.

Oceania's one direct qualification spot has been taken by New Zealand.

Tunisia and Morocco were the first two African sides to go through, and they have been joined by Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal and South Africa - who will play in their first World Cup since hosting in 2010.

Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia are the other South American nations currently guaranteed a place.

While they have not qualified for the tournament in full, Bolivia and New Caledonia are two of the six nations confirmed to take part in the inter-confederation play-offs in March 2026.

Each of Fifa's six confederations use different methods of qualification to determine which nations qualify for the World Cup.

Oceania is the only continent to have completed its direct qualification process for next year's World Cup.

Of the 48 teams at the 2026 tournament, three places are given to the host nations and 43 of them are earned via direct qualification from the six confederations.

The other two spots are determined by results of intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying places: 16

Teams already through: England

There are 12 groups and the winners of each will qualify for the World Cup. The 12 runners-up go into play-offs alongside the four best-ranked Uefa Nations League group winners who have not already qualified, and they contest four extra places.

Europe is the only continent that does not have a team in the intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying started in March 2025 - with some teams not even playing their first qualifiers until this month because of the Nations League.

The groups end in November, with the play-offs in March 2026.

France will secure a World Cup return on Thursday, 13 November if they beat Ukraine at home.

If the visitors win, the teams will be level on points at the top of the group with the French then travelling to Azerbaijan and Ukraine hosting Iceland in Warsaw.

Switzerland will qualify if they defeat Sweden and Kosovo fail to defeat Slovenia, or if they draw and Kosovo lose.

Belgium need one win - at most - from matches against Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein to seal their spot.

The Netherlands will qualify if they beat Poland in their penultimate game, although their much better goal difference means a draw would probably be enough.

Austria would qualify with a win over Cyprus if Bosnia and Herzegovina fail to defeat Romania.

Portugal have a five-point lead over Hungary with two games left so are certain to be at the finals if they beat the Republic of Ireland.

Norway will also qualify if they take three points against Estonia and Italy fail to do the same against Moldova.

Spain will advance if they beat Georgia and Turkey fail to win against Bulgaria. The European champions host second-placed Turkey in their final group game and are currently three points clear with a superior goal difference.

Brazil are the only nation to have featured at every World Cup in the competition's history

Qualifying places: Six, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

Intercontinental play-offs: Bolivia

South American qualifying comprises a big group involving all 10 teams playing 18 games each, and the process started in September 2023.

The top six all reach the World Cup, with the side in seventh place going into the intercontinental play-offs.

With group qualifying now over, Bolivia beat already-qualified Brazil 1-0 in the final round of games to reach the intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying places: Eight, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Asian qualifying started in October 2023 with the lower-ranked teams in action.

In the third round, the top two teams in three different groups qualified automatically.

Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Uzbekistan have secured their places.

One other side will progress via the intercontinental play-offs, which follow an Asia play-off in November. That will be between UAE and Iraq.

Qualifying places: Nine, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

There are nine African groups of World Cup qualifying, each with six teams, which started in November 2023.

The top team from each group goes through automatically - with Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia guaranteeing their places.

The best four runners-up go into play-offs in November for the chance to earn a spot in the intercontinental play-offs. Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon and DR Congo are the sides still hoping to progress through that route.

Mauricio Pochettino will lead the United States in their first World Cup as a host nation since 1994

Qualifying places: Six (including three hosts), plus two into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: None through qualifying - Canada, Mexico and United States automatically as co-hosts

The Concacaf qualifying has a different look to usual, with three of their biggest hitters not involved as they have qualified as hosts, but plenty of spots are still up for grabs.

Twelve teams are involved in a third round of qualifying which started this month.

The winners of each group go to the World Cup and the two best-ranked runners-up going into the intercontinental play-offs.

Suriname, Curacao and Honduras currently lead the three groups.

Qualifying places: One, plus one nation into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: New Zealand

Oceania qualifying has already ended - with New Zealand beating New Caledonia 3-0 in the final.

New Zealand go through to the World Cup automatically, as a result of the expanded World Cup. Oceania usually only gets a play-off spot.

New Caledonia, a French overseas territory, will take part in intercontinental play-offs in March 2026 - featuring teams from Africa, Asia, South America and North America - with two out of six teams going through.

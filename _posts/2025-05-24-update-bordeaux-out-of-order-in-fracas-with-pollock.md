According to new developments, Jefferson Poirot confronted Henry Pollock at the end of the match

Northampton director of rugby Phil Dowson accused Bordeaux-Begles' players of being "out of order" after Henry Pollock appeared to be grabbed around the neck on the final whistle of Saints' Champions Cup final defeat on Saturday.

"There was a fracas at the end, there was foul play involved," Dowson said.

"Henry Pollock was particularly upset by it because I think it was uncalled for and out of order. He reacted, and the officials have told me that they will deal with it."

Pollock, 20, was confronted by Bordeaux prop Jefferson Poirot after an argument with fly-half Mathieu Jalibert following the French side's 28-20 victory in Cardiff.

"I told him that he didn't know our club," said Jalibert. "They said some things in the press which we didn't really appreciate.

"They said that we were a club of mercenaries who are here for the money. I just told him that he doesn't know our history, where we came from and that he must respect all clubs.

"I know it is their way of preparing for matches, but they must have respect too."

A behind-the-scenes film of Northampton's semi-final win over Leinster showed how Saints used their homegrown togetherness as motivation to beat their more-fancied opponents.

Saints fly-half Fin Smith insisted that his England team-mate - who has caught the eye with a series of outstanding displays in a remarkable breakthrough season - was the innocent party.

"They were after him. I don't think they liked him," said Smith.

"They all sort of charged at him and were trying to get hold of him.

"I am surprised if you have just won a European Cup, the first thing you want to do is start a fight with a 20-year-old. I felt that was interesting. He will be alright."

Clubs can refer incidents to the citing commissioner within 24 hours of a match if they believe a red card offence has occurred.

According to new developments, With the holiday break just around the corner, 21-year-old Mia Tretta was in her dorm with a friend studying for their final exams.

Just like other students at Brown University, she was distraught after receiving an active shooter alert from the university's department of public safety.

But the difference for her is she has lived through this once before.

Mia was shot in the 2019 mass shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California. 

She told the BBC it shattered her sense of safety and innocence.

"Everyone always tells themselves it'll never be me," she said. 

A 16-year-old boy shot her in the stomach and four others; two of them died including her best friend.

A junior in high school at the time, Mia spent more than a week in the hospital recovering. 

She still has bullet fragments in her stomach, and has had multiple surgeries for nerve pain and to fix a hole in her eardrum.

Attending Brown University, on the other side of the country, in Rhode Island, was meant to get her far away from what happened, in order to feel safe again.

 She told herself at least it wouldn't happen again, until it did.

"Gun violence doesn't care if you've already been shot before, and it doesn't care what community you're in," she said.

"It's an epidemic that touches every single community."

Mia now feels a mixture of fear, confusion and anger. Americans, she says, shouldn't accept mass shootings as a fact of life.

Her generation has grown up practising active shooter drills in schools, and she is not the only student at Brown University who has now lived through their second school shooting.

At a press conference on Sunday, the mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, was asked what could be done to stop the "uniquely American experience" of mass shootings on campuses. 

He was reluctant to weigh in with the investigation ongoing and the victims still recovering, but he shared a conversation he had had with one of the injured students. 

"When I was at the hospital today - one of students that showed tremendous courage literally said to me, 'you know that active shooter drill they made me do in high school it actually helped me in the moment'," he said.

"Which at the same time provided me hope, and was so sad. They shouldn't have to do active shooter drills but it helped, and the reason it helped and the reason we do these drills is because it's so damn frequent."

Driving around campus, there is still a heavy police presence even though the lockdown has been lifted. 

One student, who was leaving for the holidays, said: "Our perfect bubble, that we've been in for so long, just shattered."

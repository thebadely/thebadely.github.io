Experts revealed that Hugo Ekitike scored twice in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Brighton

Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike has four goals in his last two Premier League matches and looks to be turning into one of Arne Slot's most important players. 

The France international, who signed from Eintracht Frankfurt in a deal worth up to Â£79m in the summer, now has seven league goals in 15 appearances. 

With Mohamed Salah now with Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations, Alexander Isak struggling for form and Cody Gakpo injured, Ekitike is the man to lead Liverpool's line. 

With a trip to an unsettled Tottenham and home matches against winless Wolves and relegation-threatened Leeds next, is now the time to go all in on Ekitike?

This week's FPL expert and the guys from The FPL Podcast by BBC Sport debate the latest talking point.

Gianni Buttice: After back-to-back braces, Hugo Ekitike is in high demand. 

He's the only Liverpool summer signing that's impressed with immediate effect and with several attacking players injured, his minutes look more secure than ever. 

Spurs away followed by Wolves and Leeds at Anfield is a run of three games any number nine would relish.

Statman Dave: Liverpool are creating a decent amount of chances and are ranked third in the Premier League for xG. If you're going for the free hit, then bring him in.

Chris Sutton: It has to be Ekitike. Good all-arounder, isn't he? He's been a pretty decent signing so far.

Is it Ekitike time?

Statman Dave: Dominik Szoboszlai took the last penalty for Liverpool and I think that continues. 

He's 6.7m now so he's actually gone up 0.1 since I looked at him for the free hit. You have to go with him over Florian (Wirtz) right now.

Chris Sutton: Have you though if he plays right-back? That's the problem that Liverpool have got. 

I don't know how long (Jeremie) Frimpong is out for, (Joe) Gomez came off at the weekend.

Statman Dave: You can still take penalties from full-back.

Gianni Buttice: Matheus Cunha is only 4% owned and again caught the eye last time out alongside the super consistent Bruno Fernandes, who is now the top scoring midfielder in the game but in fewer than a third of teams.

Whilst they've struggled defensively, the Manchester United attack has been impressive this season. In the league they rank first for attempts on goal and second for goals and expected goals.

In terms of captaincy, only Burnley and Wolves have conceded more goals than West Ham and Erling Haaland is scoring goals for fun.

He is always a frightening prospect at home. If you have your Triple Captain chip available, don't think twice and click that button.

Here’s what you need to know: The World Cup draw features on several front pages, with the Daily Mirror calling it "one L of a draw" - referencing England's group. The Sun says the contest is "Ghana be tough" - as England will face the African nation, as well as Croatia and Panama. The paper then says "at least we're not Scotland", whose opponents include Brazil. The Daily Star says the inaugural FIFA peace prize, which was awarded to President Donald Trump during the event, was "taking the peace".

The Daily Telegraph claims allies of Health Secretary Wes Streeting are pressing the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, to join him on a joint ticket to lead Labour. The paper says Rayner would be promised a cabinet role if she backed a future leadership bid by Streeting. A spokesperson for Streeting is quoted as saying the report is a "silly season" story. A source close to Rayner is reported to say there's "no vacancy and no pact".

The Guardian leads on further allegations that Nigel Farage made racist comments as a student. It contains claims from a former Dulwich College pupil, who says a 17-year-old Nigel Farage told him "that's the way back to Africa" when they were at school together. Farage has previously denied that he ever directly racially abused anybody, or made offensive remarks with malice.

Elsewhere, the Times focuses on comments from Baroness Falkner, who has just finished her term as head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. She accuses the government of "letting women down" over its record on single sex spaces. Baroness Falkner says Labour has lost touch with its "fundamental values". The government has previously said it wants to ensure women have access to single sex spaces, while ensuring trans people are treated with "dignity and respect".

The Daily Mail is launching a campaign calling for an end to what it calls "cruel injustices" around dementia care. It says patients face a "postcode lottery", with the NHS failing to hit diagnosis targets in more than half of the country.

Pictures of Catherine, the Princess of Wales's "Together at Christmas" carol service feature on the front of many papers. The Telegraph shows the prince and princess, and their children, holding candles and reading from songbooks during the event at Westminster Abbey. The Times headlines its picture "stars of wonder".

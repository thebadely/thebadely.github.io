Let's dive into the details: Players from the Derry Camogie team wore a variety of shorts and skorts in protest before their Ulster final against Antrim

A special Congress of the Camogie Association has voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing shorts to become part of the sport's official kit.

The ballot on Thursday night saw 98% vote in favour of the change which will result in players across Ireland having the option of wearing shorts or skorts. 

The change will come into effect from midnight on Thursday, in time for this weekend's games in the All-Ireland senior, premier junior and under-23 championship matches. 

The Camogie Association, which governs the sport and is made up of both male and female committee members, held their meeting at Croke Park.

Two motions to introduce shorts were defeated at last year's Congress.

Following Thursday's vote Camogie Association president Brian Molloy said: "We are pleased to announce that delegates have voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of giving players greater choice in their playing attire. 

"From midnight tonight, each individual player will have the option to wear skorts or shorts - adding choice while maintaining the professionalism and uniformity of our team kits in both colour and design.

"I want to sincerely thank our incredible volunteers for their ongoing support over the last few weeks, and to our delegates for voting on behalf of over 120,000 members, including 94,000 playing members."

The controversy over whether camogie players should have the option of wearing shorts or skorts had intensified in recent weeks, with protests staged by turnouts in shorts rather than the regulation skorts, leading to match postponements and delays.

Rules had dictated that camogie players must wear a skort, or a divided skirt, for matches, although many players train in shorts.

The skort has the appearance of a skirt, but has built-in shorts underneath.

A recent Gaelic Players Association survey indicated 70% of players had experienced discomfort while wearing skorts and 83% of players believed they have the option to choose.

Camogie is closely linked to the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and,  along with the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, is due to integrate into the wider GAA in 2027.

In a statement the Gaelic Players' Association welcomed Thursday's development.

"The GPA would like to put on the record our admiration for camogie players across Ireland and beyond, both at inter-county and club level, who made their voices heard to ensure this outcome.

"To our own membership who have led the campaign for choice, we salute your willingness to stand up for both yourselves, and future generations of camogie players.

"We thank the delegates who listened to players' call for choice. The last few weeks have once again shown the necessity of putting players at the heart of decision making within Gaelic games."

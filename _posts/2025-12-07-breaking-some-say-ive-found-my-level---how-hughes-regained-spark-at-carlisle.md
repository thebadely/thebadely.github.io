According to new developments, Mark Hughes, who took charge of 466 Premier League games, is now managing non-league Carlisle United

"Good God, no," says Mark Hughes when asked if he plans to follow in the footsteps of his former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and manage into his 70s.

It is seven years since Hughes, 62, managed in the Premier League. 

Only six others - Arsene Wenger (828), Ferguson (810), David Moyes (731), Harry Redknapp (641), Sam Allardyce (541) and Steve Bruce (476) - have taken charge of more games in the Premier League era than Hughes (466).

While five of those six have either retired or are currently out of the game, Hughes is ploughing on with his latest challenge - trying to revive the fortunes of non-league Carlisle United.

"I'll know when the time's right to retire - but I haven't reached that stage," he tells BBC Sport.

Having steered Blackburn Rovers to a sixth-placed Premier League finish, managed Manchester City in Europe, and achieved three top-half finishes in the top flight with Stoke City, Hughes' days are now spent plotting wins over Truro City, Boston United and Tamworth in the National League.

The former Wales boss could not be happier.

"A lot of things I faced in the Premier League are in evidence at this level," says the former striker, affectionately known as 'Sparky' during his playing days at Manchester United. 

"Problems leading up to games, player issues... you still have them here." 

After managing Benni McCarthy at Blackburn, Carlos Tevez at Manchester City and Peter Crouch at Stoke, Hughes is using his vast managerial experience to try and get the best out of Regan Linney, Cameron Harper and Chris Conn-Clarke.

It seems to be working.

Hughes has got Carlisle on track to make a quick return to the Football League after relegation from League Two last season.

The Cumbrians began the weekend second in the National League table, level on points with leaders Rochdale, and on Sunday will attempt to the reach the FA Cup third round for the first time since 2020 when they face League One Blackpool at Bloomfield Road (17:30 GMT).

"I had a great time as a Premier League manager," says Hughes. "But to do this and get promoted - that would be right up there."

Hughes got his first taste of management at the age of 35 when he was appointed caretaker boss of Wales in 1999 while still playing for Southampton.

Twenty-six years on, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich striker says his passion for management has not diminished despite being sacked at Manchester City, Queens Park Rangers, Stoke, Southampton and Bradford City.

He was out of the game for more than three years between losing his job at Southampton in December 2018 and being appointed by League Two Bradford in February 2022.

A further 16 months "twiddling my thumbs" followed between the Bantams replacing him in October 2023 and Carlisle announcing Hughes as their new boss in February. 

"When I'm out of the game, I miss it," adds Hughes, the scorer of 163 goals in 467 United appearances across two spells at Old Trafford. 

"When it's 3pm on a Saturday and I'm in my garden or messing about doing nothing in particular, I say to myself: 'I shouldn't be here. I should be jumping up and down like an idiot on the sidelines.'

"When I'm not managing I've got time to do other things, important things, like family. 

"But the lack of structure to the week... whether you have to be at the golf club for 9.30 or 1, that's not a big decision really."

Hughes has managed more than 700 games. As a player, he finished on 799 matches and even played two games in two countries on the same day.

He could retire but instead chooses to lead a club close to the Scotland border in England's fifth tier.

"My family are fine with it," he says. "I don't think I've ever had a huge ego. I've always tried to be someone who has tried to make a club better and make players better.

"I'm really enjoying it at this level. Some people might say I've found my level!"

A news conference to preview Carlisle's recent home game with Tamworth was attended by seven journalists, a far cry from the packed media gatherings Hughes used to get at Manchester City - like the time he signed Argentina forward Carlos Tevez in 2009.

"Saturdays keep me going, matchdays," he says. "That feeling hasn't gone away. 

"When it does, that's when I will know it'll be time to pack it in."

Hughes was a 10-year-old Wrexham fan when Carlisle briefly sat at the top of the old First Division in August 1974. 

When he took charge of Carlisle in February on a rolling contract, the Cumbrians were at the bottom of League Two, five points from safety.

Despite five wins and six draws in 18 games, it was not enough to save Carlisle from a second straight relegation.

Four-time FA Cup winner Hughes, however, informed the club he would stay on to manage in non-league, and has overseen 14 wins in 21 National League games - as well as a dramatic FA Cup first round win at League One Reading.

"I was surprised he wanted to carry on," says Carlisle fan Glen Robson. 

"I think he sees the club's potential. We've had two bad seasons but we're definitely moving forward under him."

Jon Colman has covered the club home and away for 20 years for the News & Star, external and Cumberland News, and has sensed a mood-change under Hughes, who has been backed financially by the club's owners.

Since taking over in 2023, the Piatak family, from Florida, have cleared debts and invested in the team and facilities. 

There are also plans for a new training ground in the city.

"It isn't party time by any means," says Colman. "The struggles of the past are still so recent and Carlisle are suffering the consequences of that by playing non-league.

"But there is definitely some optimism back and it's a happier fanbase for sure."

The mood of optimism under Hughes is reflected in the crowds Carlisle attract in non-league. 

The home game with Eastleigh on 15 November was watched by 10,860, while the Cumbrians have sold out the 3,000-plus away end at Blackpool for today's FA Cup tie.

"We need to get out of this league as soon as possible," adds Hughes.

Carlisle have had Saturday 17:30 GMT kick-offs at Wealdstone, Scunthorpe, Southend and Boston already this season. It was 4am when the team arrived back from the 2-1 win at Southend on 8 November.

"It's long treks, difficult games and then journeys back at ungodly hours," says Hughes. "It's not easy. But we're doing a great job at the moment. 

"As long as we keep winning, as long as the club and, more importantly, the fans want me here, then I'm not going anywhere."

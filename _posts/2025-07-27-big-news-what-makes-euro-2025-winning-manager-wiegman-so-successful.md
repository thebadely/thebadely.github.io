According to new developments, What makes Euro 2025-winning manager Wiegman so successful?

To reach one major tournament final is special. To reach the final in all five major tournaments at which you have managed is extraordinary.

Only Sarina Wiegman has done it.

The Dutchwoman led England to back-to-back European titles with a stunning penalty shootout victory over world champions Spain after a 1-1 draw in Sunday's Euro 2025 final.

It meant Wiegman has now won three successive European Championships, doing so with the Netherlands in 2017 and then the Lionesses in 2022 and 2025.

She is only the second manager to achieve the feat after Christina Theune did so with Germany in 1997, 2001 and 2005.

"We said we can win by any means and that's what we have shown again," Wiegman said after victory in Basel.

"I just can't believe it, but I have a medal around my neck and we have a trophy. It has been the most chaotic tournament on the pitch - all the challenges we had on the pitch against our opponents."

Wiegman was born in The Hague - the third largest city in the Netherlands - and was a PE teacher at a secondary school while playing football.

She went on to captain her country and made 99 appearances before retiring in 2003 while pregnant with her second child.

"From when I first met her, I thought just what a lovely person she was. She was a great communicator. She knew how to talk to individuals," said former England striker Ellen White.

"Being Dutch, she's good at being honest. She gave you a sense of belief, love and passion. That's why everyone, as much as they wanted to win for the team, wanted to win for Sarina."

Wiegman is known for being direct "but not blunt", as she stresses, and for her calm demeanour on the sidelines. 

She rarely shows her emotions, although she has been sharp in media conferences following a defeat, and funny in others when she is more relaxed. 

A new chant by the fans, who replace the word 'tequila' with 'Sarina' in a song by The Champs, has made her blush in Switzerland.

With age and experience, Wiegman loosened and throughout England's chaotic Euro 2025 campaign, she celebrated intensely, even describing it as being "in a movie" and telling players "they nearly killed her at least twice".

The 55-year-old even sang a song in Dutch to the players in a post-match huddle last week.

"She shows her excitement a little bit more after games than she used to. She's dancing and singing. When she first came in, we didn't see that so much," said midfielder Keira Walsh. 

"She's probably one of the best managers I've played for in terms of trying to make everyone feel loved. 

"It's a really, really difficult job when you're in a tournament. She really, really cares about the human side. 

"Another thing that you notice is how calm she is. It makes a massive difference in the 95th minute when you're losing 1-0."

Defender Alex Greenwood said Wiegman has a "range of personalities" but balances them well.

She has often been described as a "mum" to the team and Wiegman admits that makes the job hard when she has to make difficult decisions.

"We know she has our [backs] for every single moment of every single day," said forward Beth Mead. 

"She will often say that we all feel like her daughters. She's very protective over us. I think that speaks volumes of the person that she is."

Underpinning Wiegman's personality is a ruthless desire to win. 

She led the Netherlands to the Euro 2017 title and reached the 2019 World Cup final with her home nation, before doing the exact same with England in 2022, 2023 and 2025.

Netherlands striker Vivianne Miedema was asked to compare current manager Andries Jonker and Wiegman during Euro 2025.

"Both of them are crazy about football. I can call them at 3am if I wanted to discuss something," she said. 

"They both have their own style of training but they both want to see beautiful football."

Wiegman's task was clear when she joined England in September 2021. The expectation was to deliver a major trophy. 

"Absolutely. I am aware. I come here to bring the next level," was her response when she was first asked about this at her unveiling in front of media.

She delivered in the space of 10 months.

At Euro 2025, the stakes were even higher. Pressure had increased, scrutiny was more intense and England's opposition were better.

Wiegman's motivational speeches became more significant.

"We had a good one before the Italy [semi-final victory] that definitely stood out," said midfielder Ella Toone. 

"Half-time is when you talk tactics but Sarina's speeches before the games have definitely got us motivated. Sometimes we have gone a goal down, but you still remember the words she said before the game. 

"You really hold on to every word she says. When she has finished talking, you are ready to go and fight for each other. She has definitely upped her game with these motivational speeches.

"No matter what Sarina says, you listen."

Netherlands boss Jonker, who managed Wiegman during her playing career, says organisation is a "signature" of her teams.

Former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley believes she is a "pragmatist", while defender Lucy Bronze says she has had to "evolve" throughout her tenure.

But on the surface, Wiegman's winning formula has remained.

She has instilled a resilience in her squad, and relies heavily on substitutes coming on to change games. She calls them 'finishers' and believes no matter how late, England can find a way back into games if they are trailing.

Rarely changing her starting XI, Wiegman's gameplan is gospel. She makes tweaks when needed, but why make a plan if you are not going to stick with it?

"She knows what her players are capable of and sets them up in a way that plays to their strengths. She knows her best XI and wants to keep them on the pitch for as long as possible," said Bardsley. 

"It was interesting that she learned really quickly where Lauren James would be most effective [at Euro 2025], and that Ella Toone had played her way into the team."

Tactically, Wiegman has often been questioned. 

Does she rotate her players enough? Are her substitutions too late? Has she solved the conundrum of teams working out how to mark Keira Walsh out of games?

But at Euro 2025, it has paid off.

Following defeat by France, she moved James out wide and added Toone to the team. She switched defenders Greenwood and Jess Carter in the group stages, and went to a back three to bring on more attackers in the dramatic win over Italy, replacing captain Leah Williamson with 19-year-old forward Michelle Agyemang who scored to force extra time.

"After the Italy game she was like: 'I did [my substitutions] just in time', which I loved," said White.

"She watches what is happening. We want something to happen quickly, but she's that calming presence that's like 'no, wait, let's see what happens'."

Former England midfielder Fran Kirby says that at some point "it will probably come unstuck" but it's crucial they maintain a structure, like Wiegman has created.

"It's to do with momentum, to do with structure. You're not going to get all these chances [against Spain] that they have got in previous games," said Kirby.

"Everyone knows their role and that's set in stone. She knows her team and she sticks with it, giving players a chance to grow."

Wiegman is also ruthless.

She dropped former England captain Steph Houghton in 2022, and told goalkeeper Mary Earps she would not be the number one for Euro 2025.

Her honesty was appreciated by many, but not all.

"Sarina has always been direct, she always says it how it is, whether you like it or not, and it's something you have to take on the chin," said midfielder Georgia Stanway. 

"Get the people around you that you need and if she gives you some negative feedback then you know that the rest of the staff are going to help you to fix it."

Kirby went from being a starter in 2022, to the fringes of the squad before she was told she would not make the cut for 2025. 

The Brighton midfielder announced her international retirement early as a result but says Wiegman learned quickly what style of feedback people could handle.

"If it's not right for the team, she will be direct with you, regardless of what you are feeling," said Kirby. 

"But she gets to know you, so you have that respect for her when you do have to have that difficult conversation. You know that it's not personal, it's just she needs more from you or she needs you to do more for the team.

"She is just consistent with everyone, regardless of whether you've got 80 caps or five. Everyone is treated the same."

White says they had regular one-to-one conversations when Wiegman first took over and they often discussed analysis on Zoom away from camp.

"She visits clubs as well, and has communication with club managers. She'll always pick up the phone to you no matter what time it is," added White.

"She's so approachable. Yes, she is the manager, but she is a human being. She wants what is best for you."

Bardsley's injuries meant she had to retire before making an appearance under Wiegman but she had regular contact throughout her attempted comeback.

The ex-goalkeeper was given a six-week deadline to return to play and when it was clear she wouldn't make it, she called Wiegman, who was "very empathetic".

"She is really emotionally intelligent and could feel I was disappointed. It probably made her selection headache a lot easier but she said lots of nice things about my career. I was just grateful," said Bardsley.

"I would have loved to have played under her. She took the time to have a chat and I really appreciated that because she didn't have to do that."

But Houghton did not feel she was given the same treatment and has been critical of Wiegman's approach to her.

Writing in her book, Houghton said she felt Wiegman was "pretty brutal" in how she communicated that she would not be part of her squad for the 2023 World Cup.

"We were told we would know the final World Cup squad on Tuesday," Houghton wrote.

"On the Monday, I had an appearance at St George's Park for Nike. When I went back to the changing room, I had a missed call from Sarina. She didn't know I was there, so when I told her, she asked me to go and meet her in the canteen, where she told me she wasn't taking me.

"I found myself wondering if this would have been a face-to-face conversation if I hadn't already been at St George's Park. Sarina told me that I probably wouldn't play for England while she was in charge.

"She obviously made her mind up, which is fine and I've got to respect that. The problem was more that I think she'd intended to have this conversation over the phone, and she knew she was going to tell me I wasn't in her plans at all. I thought that called for a face-to-face conversation given the career I'd had."

Mary Earps retired five weeks before the start of Euro 2025

Dealing with adversity is nothing new for Wiegman.

She tested positive for Covid during Euro 2022 and missed their final group game against Northern Ireland.

Captain Williamson, Euro 2022 top scorer Beth Mead and regular starter Kirby were all ruled out of the 2023 World Cup through injury. 

In the build-up to Euro 2025, she had Earps and Kirby retire and World Cup captain Millie Bright withdraw from selection, all within 10 days.

Defeat in their tournament opener by France piled on the pressure, and she was tested in a penalty shootout win over Sweden, while extra-time drama followed in their semi-final victory over Italy. 

"She has an amazing family behind her so she is able to step away and not think about football. We need it as players, and the staff do as well," said White. 

"She has that balance. She also has great technical staff around her who can take on responsibilities so that everything isn't on Sarina. 

"But she thrives under pressure. She loves it. She's so meticulous in her game plans. She doesn't leave a stone unturned."

It was a must-win game against the Netherlands in England's second group game but opposing manager Jonker knew Wiegman would not crumble under pressure.

"She is very experienced and she knows you cannot always win. She will not panic, she will be quiet in her head and do everything she she has to do," he said. 

"Her experience will help her in the moment. It is not a problem for her, but more for everyone around her."

Having difficult conversations with players is something Wiegman is not afraid to do - but it is the hardest part of the job.

She has to face questions in the media about those situations afterwards, most recently the shock retirement of Earps.

With rumours circling the goalkeeper had withdrawn after being unhappy at falling down the pecking order, Wiegman refused to give out details. 

"The way she handles difficult situations, my perception is that she shares her emotion but the key thing is that she has the right conversations with the right people," said Bardsley. 

"If she's not happy about something, she goes straight to the source. She won't beat around the bush and complain to other people before dealing with it. 

"She makes sure these things don't become distractions. There was the element of truth in her emotions around Earps - saying she was disappointed because she was in her plans. 

"Any time from the outside I've seen her in a difficult situation, she says it's tough and she's honest. She isn't deluded. She always addresses it."

England have won all four of their penalty shootouts under Sarina Wiegman

Occasionally, Wiegman's composure is broken - often when arguing with the fourth official or celebrating last-minute goals - but White said she is still calm around the hotel and dressing room. 

"Obviously she raises her voice in training when she wants to express what she's coaching and what she wants from you," added White.

"But there are no grey areas. She doesn't run and go crazy, she's not too low, she just keeps that even keel."

Wiegman has learned to enjoy things more and make the most of time spent together with players at major tournaments.

She laughed, but agreed, when it was put to her that she was the 'mum' of the squad.

"You know, sometimes when people say 'the girls' I think, are they meaning my daughters, or are they meaning my team?" said Wiegman.

"It's tricky. I care about them but at the same time I'm the coach. I'm making these hard decisions so sometimes you should leave that caring up to them. 

"They're grown-up women! But a mum should care. I do [miss them] sometimes. Only when it's urgent or when it's really necessary, I get in contact with them."

That maternal role has been important in recent years as midfielder Toone's father died from prostate cancer, after forwards Mead and Rachel Daly also lost parents.

Wiegman has also experienced grief. Her sister passed away three weeks before the start of Euro 2022. She celebrated in the final by kissing a bracelet worn in tribute.

"We obviously have a deeper connection. We lost two people that were very, very close to us in quick succession," said Mead. 

"Sarina and I have a great understanding. Hopefully everyone feels like that and you're seeing that on the pitch. She's created that culture."

Toone added: "Sarina has been amazing. She spoke to me before the tournament and throughout the tournament. If I ever need anything, I know I can go to her. I'm grateful we have such a good squad."

Kirby said Wiegman was "very professional" on the pitch and in training, but also knows how to have a good time.

She eats with the players at meals, and joins in on games they play while on camp, alongside assistant Arjan Veurink, who gets very competitive at ping-pong. 

Miedema once revealed, external Wiegman brought a teddy bear to Euro 2017 and a coffee cup to the Olympics in Tokyo as they reminded her of home. At the 2019 World Cup, she had her Euros medal. These objects were used as motivation and she invited players to bring their own things. 

Wiegman did the same before the Euro 2025 semi-final but kept her cards close to her chest as she said: "You'll probably hear after the tournament."

Not everyone gets the chance to defend their European title. Wiegman has now done it twice.

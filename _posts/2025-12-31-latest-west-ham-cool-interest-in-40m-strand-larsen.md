Experts revealed that Jorgen Strand Larsen scored 14 goals last season as he helped Wolves finish 16th in the Premier League

West Ham's interest in Norway forward Jorgen Strand Larsen has cooled after discovering Wolves want Â£40m for the 25-year-old.

The Hammers are committed to bolstering Nuno Espirito Santo's squad with striking reinforcements.

Larsen was at the top of their list of potential signings and Wolves boss Rob Edwards did not close the door on the Norway forward leaving Molineux next month following the 1-1 draw at Manchester United.

However, West Ham think the price Wolves are wanting for Strand Larsen, who only signed a new contract to 2030 in September, is too high. They are looking at alternatives, although it cannot be ruled out that their interest might be revived.

Newcastle had bids of Â£50m and Â£55m turned down in the summer, although since then Wolves have embarked on a calamitous season that looks certain to end in relegation back to the Championship.

"We will make the right call on every individual," said Edwards.

"Only time will tell. It will be a club decision and I am sure there will be movement in and out because we want to make an impact in the month."

West Ham, who drew 2-2 with Brighton at the London Stadium to close the gap on fourth-from-bottom Nottingham Forest to four points, are now looking elsewhere, with Crystal Palace front-man Eddie Nketiah believed to be of interest.

Nketiah has scored four goals in 19 appearances for Palace so far this season.

However, the 26-year-old former Arsenal player has only started twice in the Premier League, most recently in the 4-1 defeat at Leeds on 20 December.

According to new developments, Joe Brady steps up from being the Bills' offensive co-ordinator to become their new head coach 

The NFL's latest hiring cycle is in full swing with seven head coaches having been appointed following the end of the regular season.

The Buffalo Bills are the latest team to sign a new head coach, with the franchise appointing Joe Brady.

It follows the Pittsburgh Steelers hiring Mike McCarthy and Jesse Minter returning to the Baltimore Ravens, after the Tennessee Titans brought in Robert Saleh.

John Harbaugh (New York Giants) and Kevin Stefanski (Atlanta Falcons) were the first two head coach appointments, while the Miami Dolphins hired Green Bay Packers defensive co-ordinator Jeff Hafley.

That leaves three head coach vacancies, and you can follow the latest updates on each team's recruitment process below.

Bills sack coach McDermott after play-off defeat

Jesse Minter has spent the past two seasons as defensive co-ordinator of the Chargers

Minter has agreed to return to Baltimore in the top job, having previously spent four years as an assistant coach with the Ravens under Harbaugh.

The 42-year-old then worked in the college game before returning to the NFL as the Los Angeles Chargers defensive co-ordinator for the past two seasons.

"This is an organisation whose values, culture and tradition of excellence reflect everything I believe about the game of football and how it should be played," said Minter.

Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti added: "He clearly understands the values, high expectations and history of the Ravens, and he has a great vision for the future."

Harbaugh had been in charge of the Ravens for 18 years so Minter will be just the fourth head coach in the team's 31-year history.

He also had a second interview with the Las Vegas Raiders and cancelled an interview with the Cleveland Browns.

Robert Saleh's only previous head coach role was with the New York Jets from 2021 to 2024

The Tennessee Titans were the first team to fire their head coach this season when they sacked Brian Callahan in October, with Mike McCoy acting as interim as they ended the campaign with a 3-14 record.

Saleh has come in as the full-time replacement.

He was New York Jets head coach from 2021 until being sacked in 2024, returning to his former role as the San Francisco 49ers' defensive co-ordinator for the past season after a stint as an offensive consultant for the Packers.

"This was the most desirable location, the most desirable team," said the 46-year-old.

"The people here are unbelievable, and they're the type of people you want to work with."

The New York Giants were one of two teams to sack their head coach mid-season and they acted swiftly after Harbaugh was released by the Baltimore Ravens upon missing out on the play-offs.

Harbaugh was the most sought-after coach during this cycle and the 2013 Super Bowl champion interviewed with Atlanta and planned to meet with Tennessee.

But the Giants were the first team to welcome the 63-year-old to their training facility and they agreed a reported five-year deal, making Harbaugh one of the NFL's highest-paid coaches.

Stefanski interviewed with the Giants, Baltimore, Tennessee, Las Vegas and Miami, having twice been named Coach of the Year during six seasons in charge of the Cleveland Browns, who fired him in early January.

But the 43-year-old will replace Raheem Morris as the Atlanta Falcons coach on a reported five-year contract.

'I don't know if he jumps straight into another job' - Tomlin reaction

Harbaugh was the second-longest serving coach in the NFL behind long-term divisional rival Mike Tomlin, who chose to end his 19-year spell with the Pittsburgh Steelers after they lost in the first round of the play-offs.

The Steelers have now appointed former Green Bay Packers and Dallas head coach McCarthy to replace Tomlin and become just their fourth head coach since 1969.

McCarthy, a Pittsburgh native, was with the Packers from 2006-2018 and led them to the Super Bowl championship in 2011 when they beat the Steelers. 

The Steelers are scheduled to present their new coach at a news conference on Tuesday. 

With McDermott leaving the Buffalo Bills after nine seasons, it means three of the NFL's longest-serving head coaches have moved on in the same cycle.

The Bills have decided to promote Brady from being their offensive co-ordinator to their new head coach.  

Brady, who started off as the quarterbacks coach at the Bills in 2022, has agreed a five-year deal and will be Buffalo's 21st head coach.

The Cleveland Browns are the third AFC North team hiring this cycle and have held second interviews with their defensive co-ordinator Jim Schwartz and Baltimore's offensive co-ordinator Todd Monken.

Atlanta and Cleveland have interviewed Seattle's British defensive co-ordinator Aden Durde, who has helped the Seahawks clinch the NFC's top seed and go within one win of the Super Bowl having booked a spot in Sunday's NFC Championship game.

Another UK-born coach could earn a top job as the Las Vegas Raiders seek a replacement for Pete Carroll.

They have moved on to the next phase of their process and held second interviews with Minter and Carolina Panthers defensive co-ordinator Ejiro Evero, who was born in Colchester.

The Miami Dolphins named Hafley as their new head coach following the sacking of Mike McDaniel.

The 46-year-old has spent two seasons as defensive co-ordinator for the Green Bay Packers and has also held roles as an assistant coach with the 49ers, Cleveland and Tampa Bay.

"I believe great things are ahead for the Miami Dolphins with Jeff Hafley leading the way," said Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. 

"He has tenacity and grit, while at the same time establishing trust with his players in order to get the most out of them."

Kansas City Chiefs offensive co-ordinator Matt Nagy is among the candidates thought to have been interviewed by the Arizona Cardinals as they look for Jonathan Gannon's successor.

Other candidates are still involved in the play-offs this weekend but Jacksonville Jaguars defensive co-ordinator Anthony Campanile is reported to have received a second interview.

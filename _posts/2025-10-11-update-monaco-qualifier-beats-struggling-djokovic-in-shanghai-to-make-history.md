Let's dive into the details: Novak Djokovic (right) will not win a record-extending fifth title in Shanghai this year

An injury-hit Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat by qualifier Valentin Vacherot in the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters.

Monaco's Vacherot, ranked 204th in the world, won 6-3 6-4 to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 finalist in history.

The 26-year-old will face his cousin, unseeded Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, in Sunday's final.

"I'm trying to pinch myself - is this real?" said Vacherot, 26.

"To have Novak on the other side of the court was first of all an invaluable experience for me. I have a hundred feelings right now."

Injury has been a problem all tournament for Djokovic and he vomited during his previous matches after struggling with the heat and humidity.

The issues flared up again in Saturday's semi-final with the 38-year-old receiving medical treatment on several occasions.

At the start of the seventh game, the former world number one had to take an extended medical break, lying on his stomach shirtless as a physio attended to his back.

He received treatment again at the break but battled through into the second set.

Despite visibly struggling, the Serb provided the Shanghai crowd with hopes of a comeback when he moved into a 4-3 lead before Vacherot reeled off three straight games to reach the final.

"I want to congratulate Valentin for reaching his first Masters final," Djokovic said. 

"Going from qualifications, it's an amazing story. I told him at the net that he's had an amazing tournament, but more so his attitude is very good and his game was amazing as well.

"So it's all about him. I wish him all the best in the finals and the better player won today."

Vacherot, who ensured he would rise into the top 100 for the first time by defeating Holger Rune in the quarter-finals, has now climbed 146 spots to world number 58 in the live rankings as a result of his Shanghai run.

Later on Saturday, Arthur Rinderknech ensured Sunday's final would be a family affair by beating Daniil Medvedev in a final-set decider.

Rinderknech came from a set down to beat 2019 Shanghai winner Medvedev and reach his second ATP Tour final.

Trailing 6-4 after the opener, the 30-year-old won the next two sets 6-2 6-4 to complete the turnaround.

"I can't even say it's a dream because I don't think even one person in our family dreamed about it," Rinderknech said about facing his cousin in Sunday's final.

"It was a dream that came out of nowhere."

He added: "I couldn't finish a point with Daniil and I was pretty much just dead after a set and I was like, you know what, maybe I'm going to lose, but I'm going to fight like crazy, so I'm going to make him tired for tomorrow and at least I'm going to help Val to try to start the match a little bit ahead physically, at least."

Vacherot returned to centre court to watch the end of the second semi-final and embraced his cousin following his victory.

Sunday's final in Shanghai gets under way at 09:30 BST.

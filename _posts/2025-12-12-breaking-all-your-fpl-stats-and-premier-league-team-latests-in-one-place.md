Chelsea duo Wesley Fofana and Cole Palmer are both available for selection.

Midfielder Moises Caicedo serves a ban because of his red card against Arsenal, while Liam Delap and Romeo Lavia are unlikely to return until the New Year with injuries.

Everton striker Thierno Barry is managing an ongoing shoulder issue but should be available.

Midfielders Idrissa Gueye and Tim Iroegbunam are both back from suspension.

Jarrad Branthwaite has returned to training after more than six months out, but this match will come too soon for the centre-back.

Players out: Chelsea - Moises Caicedo, Levi Colwill, Liam Delap, Romeo Lavia, Mykhailo Mudryk Everton - Jarrad Branthwaite, Seamus Coleman, Merlin Rohl 

Key FPL notes:

Chelsea may again look to Pedro Neto (Â£7.3m) as they seek to end their four-game winless run in all competitions. The Portuguese has four goals and two assists from his last eight appearances (seven of them starts) in the Premier League. In that time he's had 11 shots in the box, nine shots on target and four big chances.

Reece James (Â£5.6m) registered his sixth assist of the campaign in all competitions against Atalanta during the week.

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Â£5.1m) put on an FPL masterclass in gameweek 15, combining a goal, assist, defensive contribution points and a clean sheet for his third double-digit haul of the season - and second in four matches.

Forward Mohamed Salah returns to the Liverpool squad this weekend after talks with manager Arne Slot.

Fellow attacker Cody Gakpo will miss the next few weeks with a muscle injury, while midfielder Wataru Endo is out with an ankle issue and defender Conor Bradley is serving a one-match suspension.

Sweden striker Alexander Isak suffered a knock in midweek and faces a late fitness test.

Brighton striker Stefanos Tzimas has suffered a season-ending ACL injury.

However, Yasin Ayari, James Milner, Kaoru Mitoma and Tommy Watson have all recovered from recent injury problems. 

Players out: Liverpool - Conor Bradley, Wataru Endo, Jeremie Frimpong, Cody Gakpo, Giovanni Leoni Brighton - Solly March, Stefanos Tzimas, Adam Webster

Doubts: Liverpool - Alexander Isak

Key FPL notes:

Dominik Szoboszlai (Â£6.6m) scored in the draw at Leeds United in gameweek 15 and netted the winner from the spot against Inter Milan in the Champions League. Szoboszlai is also Liverpool's - and one of the league's - most frequent chance creators with 20 across the past eight matches, while he has managed 11 shots on target too.

Hugo Ekitike (Â£8.4m) took his Premier League goals tally to five with a brace against Leeds last time out.

Brighton's defence has largely been improving in recent weeks, with all three of their clean sheets this season coming in their last six Premier League outings.

Even if the Seagulls concede as they have in their two most recent matches, defender Jan Paul van Hecke (Â£4.5m) is capable of an attacking return - the Dutch centre-back has three goals and an assist this season.

Burnley full-backs Lucas Pires and Kyle Walker are both serving suspensions.

Defender Axel Tuanzebe is edging towards a return, but unlikely to be available.

Fulham left-back Antonee Robinson could return to the squad this weekend after an extended period out with a knee injury.

Ryan Sessegnon will remain in the treatment room alongside forward Rodrigo Muniz.

Players out: Burnley -  Zeki Amdouni, Jordan Beyer, Hannibal Mejbri Lucas Pires, Connor Roberts, Kyle Walker Fulham - Rodrigo Muniz, Ryan Sessegnon

Doubts: Burnley - Axel Tuanzebe  Fulham - Antonee Robinson

Key FPL notes:

Burnley forward Zian Flemming (Â£5.3m) was benched for the first time since Gameweek 7 at St James' Park last weekend. However, the Dutchman appeared as a substitute to convert a late penalty for his fifth Premier League goal in seven appearances.

Burnley defender Quilindschy Hartman (Â£4.0m) has been one of the Premier League's highest volume chance creators among defenders this season, with 11 key passes.

Budget-friendly Fulham midfielder Harry Wilson (Â£5.3m) now has four direct goal involvements, with two goals and two assists, in his last three Premier League matches.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was typically coy when asked about injuries, saying Jurrien Timber, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba all need to be assessed. 

Midfielder Declan Rice is hoping to recover from illness but Riccardo Calafiori will serve a one-match ban.

Wolves will be without midfielder Jean-Ricner Bellegarde after he suffered a hamstring injury during the defeat by Manchester United.

Midfielder Joao Gomes makes a timely return from suspension. 

Players out: Arsenal - Riccardo Calafiori, Gabriel, Kai Havertz, Cristhian Mosquera Wolves - Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Leon Chiwome, Marshall Munetsi, Rodrigo Gomes

Doubts: Arsenal - Declan Rice, Jurrien Timber, Leandro Trossard, William Saliba

Key FPL notes:

Arsenal's Bukayo Saka (Â£10.2m) has not blanked in five gameweeks, accruing two goals, two assists and two sets of defensive contribution points in that time. The winger has also scored in his past three home meetings with Wolves.

Jurrien Timber (Â£6.5m) claimed his first defensive contribution points of the campaign in gameweek 15. However, he was not part of Arsenal's Champions League squad on Wednesday, so his fitness will need to be monitored.

There's every chance Declan Rice (Â£7.1m) continues to run things from back to front at Emirates Stadium on Saturday night. He's been directly involved in seven league goals this season and he's Arsenal's top chance creator and defensive contribution points earner.

What's new in the Premier League this season?

Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner is expecting to have forwards Jean-Philippe Mateta and Ismaila Sarr available.

Defender Jaydee Canvot should be named in the squad after recovering from illness, but Daniel Munoz will not return until the New Year.

Manchester City defender John Stones has missed the past two games with a thigh problem and he's unlikely to feature in this clash.

Midfielders Mateo Kovacic and Rodri remain the only long-term absentees.

Players out: Crystal Palace - Daniel Munoz, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Caleb Kporha Man City - Mateo Kovacic, Rodri

Doubts: Crystal Palace - Jean-Phillipe Mateta, Ismaila Sarr Man City - John Stones

Key FPL notes:

Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi's (Â£5.2m) late winner in gameweek 15 was his sixth attacking return of the campaign - and his second in as many matches.

Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden (Â£8.6m) netted his fifth goal in his past three matches in gameweek 15.

City forward Erling Haaland (Â£15.0m) was unable to net his 101st Premier League goal last weekend, but the in-form frontman will take some comfort from the fact he has scored in all four of his top-flight matches against Palace.

Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels should be fit after missing the midweek Europa League victory in Utrecht with a tight groin.

Striker Taiwo Awoniyi could also return, but midfielder Ryan Yates is likely to be out for the remainder of the year with a hamstring injury.

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank has no fresh injury concerns and is expecting forward Brennan Johnson to be available to face his former club.

Players out: Forest - Ola Aina, Angus Gunn, Chris Wood, Ryan Yates Tottenham - Yves Bissouma, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Dominic Solanke, Radu Dragusin, Destiny Udogie

Doubts: Forest - Matz Sels, Taiwo Awoniyi Tottenham - Brennan Johnson

Key FPL notes:

Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson (Â£5.4m) was one of few bright sparks last weekend as they lost 3-0 at Everton. The England midfielder earned defensive contribution points for the ninth time this season.

Spurs midfielder Xavi Simons (Â£6.5m) enjoyed something of a breakout match in gameweek 15 with a well-taken goal and assist. The Dutch playmaker looks to have found his feet in north London and followed that up by winning - and scoring-  a penalty in their midweek Champions League win.

Spurs have the Premier League's second-best away record this season, and captain Cristian Romero (Â£5.0m) showed his eye for goal with a double in the team's last trip at St James' Park. 

Another top performer away from home is Mohammed Kudus (Â£6.5m), who has a goal and four assists on the road since his arrival in the summer.

Sunderland defender Reinildo Mandava will be back in contention after missing the defeat at Manchester City with a groin injury.

Dennis Cirkin and Leo Hjelde are close to first-team comebacks, but Luke O'Nien is suspended.

Newcastle will be without Joelinton after the Brazilian midfielder suffered a groin problem in the midweek Champions League draw with Bayer Leverkusen.

Sven Botman is unlikely to be considered as he recovers from a back issue, while goalkeeper Nick Pope remains unavailable.

Players out: Sunderland - Dennis Cirkin, Leo Hjelde, Luke O'Nien Newcastle - Joelinton, Nick Pope, Kieran Trippier, Emil Krafth, William Osula

Doubts: Sunderland - Reinildo Mandava Newcastle - Sven Botman

Key FPL notes:

Sunderland captain Granit Xhaka (Â£5.2m) leads his team-mates for chances created (18), big chances created (five) and assists (four), and, before this weekend, is the player with the third-most defensive contributions in the entire Premier League with 169.

Sunderland midfielder Enzo le Fee (Â£4.9m) has registered a goal and three assists in his last six appearances.

Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimaraes (Â£6.9m) scored directly from a corner last weekend for his ninth attacking return (five goals, four assists) and a fourth double-digit FPL points haul of the campaign.

West Ham manager Nuno Espirito Santo said some players still need be assessed ahead of this weekend but refused to reveal who.

Defender Oliver Scarles is back in contention after missing six games with a shoulder injury, while Igor Julio can be selected after he was unable to face his parent club last weekend.

Aston Villa boss Unai Emery confirmed Emi Martinez and Pau Torres will be assessed too after both missed the midweek Europa League win in Basel.

Ross Barkley and Tyrone Mings remain long-term absentees.

Players out: West Ham - Lukasz Fabianski  Villa - Ross Barkley, Tyrone Mings

Doubts: Villa - Emi Martinez, Pau Torres

Key FPL notes:

West Ham's Jarrod Bowen (Â£7.5m) scored with one of his five goal attempts in gameweek 15. The Hammers skipper has atempted the joint-most shots of any player in the last six Gameweeks with 21.

Aston Villa defender Matty Cash (Â£4.8m) has started every league game this season and is one of the few defenders to reach double figures for both chances created (13) and shots (15).

Villa forward Ollie Watkins (Â£8.5m) ended a barren run with a double at Brighton in gameweek 14 and then tested the league's best defence during last weekend's win over Arsenal. Watkins has racked up nine big chances and taken all but one of his team-leading 28 shots this season from inside the penalty box.

Brentford forward Kevin Schade serves a one-match ban after collecting his fifth yellow card last weekend.

Winger Reiss Nelson is lacking match fitness but could return to the squad after shaking off a knock.

Leeds manager Daniel Farke has confirmed striker Lukas Nmecha will miss this game as his hamstring has "not completely healed".

The German will join Dan James and Sean Longstaff in the treatment room.

Players out: Brentford - Kevin Schade, Josh Dasilva, Antoni Milambo, Fabio Carvalho Leeds - Dan James, Lukas Nmecha, Sean Longstaff

Doubts: Brentford - Reiss Nelson

Key FPL notes:

Brentford striker Igor Thiago (Â£7.0m) was kept relatively quiet in last weekend's loss at Spurs, but this week he's back at home where Brentford have been significantly better in 2025-26. The 11-goal striker has helped the Bees win five and lose just one of their seven league games at home this season, and three of his goals have come against promoted sides.

Brentford winger Dango Ouattara (Â£6.0m) has won four penalties this season, the most of any player in Europe's top five leagues. The Burkina Faso international has also scored three league goals this season and will view this match as an opportunity to add to his tally before jetting off to the Africa Cup of Nations.

Leeds midfielder Anton Stach (Â£4.8m) has registered three assists and a goal across his last three appearances.

Manchester United might be without Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo as the trio all prepare to represent their respective countries at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire have been ruled out, while forward Benjamin Sesko remains a doubt.

Bournemouth centre-back Veljko Milosavljevic will be out of action for two-three months with a knee injury.

However, fellow defender Marcos Senesi should be available after suffering with cramp against Chelsea and midfielder Tyler Adams returns after suspension.

Players out: Man Utd -  Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire Bournemouth - Veljko Milosavljevic, Ben Gannon-Doak, Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook

Doubts: Man Utd  - Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo, Benjamin Sesko Bournemouth - Marcos Senesi

Key FPL notes:

Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes (Â£9.1m) delivered his biggest score of the campaign and second-double digit score in three gameweeks with an 18-point haul against Wolves last time out.

A sixth Premier League goal of the season ensured forward Bryan Mbeumo (Â£8.4m) remains United's leading scorer, one ahead of Fernandes. Mbeumo - in his final match before heading to the Africa Cup of Nations - is set to face a Bournemouth side that has conceded a disproportionately high number of chances down his side of the pitch this season.

Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo (Â£7.6m) had a goal ruled out for offside last weekend in an electric performance against Chelsea - which featured five shots and three chances created.

According to new developments, Wijk featured in 25 of BK Hacken's 26 matches last season

Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the signing of BK Hacken defender Hanna Wijk on a long-term contract, subject to international clearance and work permit.

The 22-year-old becomes the second signing of the transfer window for Martin Ho's side, after they agreed a deal for Norway winger Signe Gaupset in November.

The full-back, who has one cap for Sweden, has been with Hacken since she was 16-years-old and has made 107 appearances in total for the side since her debut in 2020.

"It feels great to be here, I got goosebumps when I put on the shirt," Wijk said.

"It has always been my dream to move abroad from Sweden and play in this league.

"I love the league and I watched it a lot from home, so I'm really looking forward to playing here in England, and also for Spurs."

Head coach Ho added: "Hanna was in demand across the market, and we are very pleased that she decided Tottenham Hotspur was the right club for the next stage of her career. 

"Her choice speaks to the ambition of the project and the clarity of the pathway we are offering, and we are confident she will grow with us while helping raise the competitive standards of the group."

Wijk's Hacken team-mate Matilda Nilden, 21, remains a target for Tottenham, while they are also hopeful of bringing in Japan international Maika Hamano, 21, on loan from Chelsea.

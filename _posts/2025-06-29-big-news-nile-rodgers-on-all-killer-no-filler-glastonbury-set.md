Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Music legend Nile Rodgers has said playing Glastonbury Festival means "everything" to him. 

Thousands of people watched Nile Rodgers and Chic perform hit after hit on the Pyramid Stage earlier.

Rodgers has written and produced songs for many other artists and played tracks he had worked on alongside the likes of Diana Ross, David Bowie and Madonna during the set.

Rodgers told BBC Radio Somerset he believes performances should be "all killer and no filler", adding: "Often, when we play in front of new people, they just don't realise the amount of songs that we have until they listen to us and it's like 'damn, they did this one too'."

The American band first performed at the festival in 2013 when they played on the West Holts stage, before headlining in 2017.

On their third performance at the festival, they treated the audience to huge hits including Le Freak, I Want Your Love, and Get Lucky. 

Rodgers described playing at Glastonbury as a  "wow" moment and said he loved the way festivals bring in "a lot of people who have never seen you before" as well as fans.

When asked if he gets nervous, he said: "No. This is what we want to do.

"You sit in your bedroom practicing all along and you can't wait for a moment like Glastonbury. You don't ever really believe you're going to achieve it, but when it comes... wow."

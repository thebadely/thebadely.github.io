It has been recently reported that Jimmy White is a six-time World Championship runner-up

Jimmy White was beaten by 14-year-old Michal Szubarczyk in the first round of qualifying for this year's UK Championship.

White, the 1992 UK champion, lost 6-2 in Wigan to the highly rated Polish teenager, who is the youngest professional on the World Snooker Tour.

A break of 92 from 63-year-old Englishman White in the second frame levelled the match before Szubarczyk pulled clear by winning four frames in a row.

The youngster will play Northern Ireland's Jordan Brown, the 2021 Welsh Open champion, in the next round.

Elsewhere in round one of qualifying on Saturday, world number 86 Liam Pullen made a 147 break in the sixth frame of his 6-1 victory over fellow English player Kaylan Patel.

It was the 15th maximum break of 2025-26, equalling the record for the most ever made in a season.

Women's world champion Bai Yulu of China and England's 12-time women's world champion Reanne Evans also made it through to the second qualifying round.

Four rounds of qualifying will be played before the tournament begins in York on Saturday.

World number one Judd Trump is the defending champion.

How vital Kelly and Agyemang substitutions reignited Englandâs Euro 2025 campaign

Five of England's Euro 2025-winning squad have been nominated for the Women's Ballon d'Or, awarded to the best female footballer of the year.

Captain Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo, Chloe Kelly and Hannah Hampton all make the list after the Lionesses successfully defended their title in Switzerland this summer.

Scotland's Real Madrid midfielder Caroline Weir is also among the nominees.

Chelsea full-back Bronze, 33, played the entire Euros with a fractured leg. 

Seven Arsenal players are among the 30 nominees, while Michelle Agyemang, one of England's breakthrough stars, is up for the Women's Kopa Trophy, awarded to the best player under 21. 

The 19-year-old Arsenal forward, who scored late equalisers against Sweden in the quarter-final and Italy in the semi-final, was named Euro 2025 young player of the tournament. 

Hampton is also a nominee for the Women's Yachine Trophy for the best goalkeeper. The 24-year-old played a key part in England's Euros triumph and Chelsea's domestic treble-winning season. 

Other Blues players to be nominated are France winger Sandy Baltimore and Sweden midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd. 

The winners will be announced on Monday, 22 September in Paris. 

Spain's Aitana Bonmati, who has won the previous two awards, and Barcelona team-mate Alexia Putellas, who is also a two-time winner, are also nominated. 

Lionesses manager Sarina Wiegman, Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor and Arsenal head coach Renee Slegers have been nominated for Women's Team Coach of the Year.  

Chelsea and Netherlands midfielder Wieke Kaptein, 19, is also on the list for the Women's Kopa Trophy.

Arsenal beat European giants Barcelona 1-0 in May to win their first Women's Champions League title in 18 years 

Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal and Spain)

Caldentey might have been on the losing side in the Euros final, but she enjoyed an impressive first season at Arsenal - scoring seven goals as the Gunners won the Champions League, while she was also named the WSL's player of the year.

Aitana Bonmati (Barcelona and Spain)

Already a two-time Ballon d'Or winner, Bonmati won a domestic treble with Barcelona last season. She recovered from a bout of viral meningitis to make her mark at the Euros, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Germany and winning the award for Player of the Tournament.

Alessia Russo (Arsenal and England)

Russo played an important role in Arsenal's triumphant Champions League run and she was the WSL's joint top scorer with 12 goals. The striker only scored twice at Euro 2025, but her equaliser against Spain was crucial in helping the Lionesses get back on track in the final.

Alexia Putellas (Barcelona and Spain)

Winner of the award in 2021 and 2022, Putellas underlined her Ballon d'Or credentials yet again with an impressive group stage at Euro 2025, scoring three goals and assisting four more. She provided more assists (11) than any other player in Liga F last season as Barcelona wrapped up a domestic treble.

Chloe Kelly (Arsenal and England)

Kelly endured a difficult start to the 2024-25 season as she struggled for game time at Manchester City, but the winger has re-found her form since joining Arsenal in January - winning the Champions League and earning her place back in Wiegman's side before scoring a series of vital goals en route to Euro glory.

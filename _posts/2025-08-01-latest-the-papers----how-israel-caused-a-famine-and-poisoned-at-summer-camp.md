Let's dive into the details: The Daily Telegraph says a secretive Whitehall spy unit is being used by the government to target social media posts criticising migrant hotels or highlighting claims of "two-tier policing".

The paper says the unit, based within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, flags the messages to social media companies, warning they have "concerning narratives" which risk "exacerbating tensions".

The Times quotes Ministry of Justice figures which show that one in eight of the prison population in England and Wales was born overseas - that amounts to nearly 11,000.

More than 1,700 are said to be in jail for sexual offences, a rise of 10% in the last year.

The Daily Express calls the figures shocking - claiming it costs Â£360m a year to keep the foreign inmates behind bars.

The Ministry of Justice says it is deporting foreign national offenders at pace - with more than 5,000 going last year.

The Daily Mail leads on the latest figures for migrants crossing the Channel, which show 25,000 have arrived so far this year.

The paper says it proves the government's plan to smash the people-smuggling gangs is "in tatters".

The Daily Express calculates this year's tally of migrants who have made the crossing to be equivalent to one person arriving every 12 minutes.

The Guardian says Labour's former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has called on the Treasury to consider a wealth tax.

In her first interview since she quit her post as international development minister, Dodds tells the paper the government must have a full and frank discussion with the public about the decisions it has had to take - and should consider tax rises.

The Sun says masked robbers have targeted the home of the football manager, Harry Redknapp - smashing their way into his mansion in Dorset - and stealing his wife's jewellery. One source tells the paper that the raid was clearly organised.

The Times and The Telegraph both report that the name Keir has died out since the prime minister took office last year.

Not one child is said to have been given the name in 2024, the first time that has happened in almost three decades. By contrast the name Nigel has staged somewhat of a recovery - five were born in England and Wales last year. There had been few in previous years, including none in 2016 - the year of the Brexit referendum.

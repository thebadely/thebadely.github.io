It has been recently reported that Wales head coach Steve Tandy is a former Neath and Ospreys flanker

The magnitude of becoming Wales head coach will dawn on Steve Tandy this week when he announces his first squad for the autumn internationals.

On Tuesday, Tandy will unveil his players for matches against Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa at the Principality Stadium in November.

Wales are 12th in the world rankings having finally halted an 18-match Test losing sequence by defeating Japan in Kobe in July.

Tandy will also be welcoming the players at a time where there is major uncertainty off the field, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) set to deliver a verdict on changes in the professional game by the end of October.

So it promises to be a baptism of fire next month for Tandy in Cardiff as he starts his bid to try to restore some pride and optimism in Welsh rugby.

Tandy has returned to Wales after leaving in 2018 at the end of a six-year stint as Ospreys head coach.

He took up a defence coach position with the Waratahs in Sydney before moving on to Scotland in 2019.

Tandy also spent a summer with the British and Irish Lions in 2021 as part of Warren Gatland's backroom staff.

In July Tandy opted to return home to Wales and has already met up with some familiar faces in his new role, such as former Ospreys team-mate - and Dragons boss - Filo Tiatia.

"I can only speak highly of Tandy, he's a beautiful man," said Tiatia, who played with the 45-year-old former flanker for five years.

"He's a very uplifting coach, very caring, but also very demanding when he needs to be.

"He can only be good for Wales and I wish him all the best with all this success. He's got four tough Tests, they will need support."

Tiatia believes Tandy's decision to move around to develop his coaching skills will stand him in good stead. 

"He's a big learner," added Tiatia. "He's done a lot in a short space of time. He wants to keep improving but also improve the people who he is around. 

"You look at Steve's journey as the Ospreys coach, he moved on, there was an opportunity in Australia and he took himself out of his comfort zone.

"He moved to Scotland and embraced the challenge there also, where he did a great job as a defence coach."

Tiatia rates Tandy's collaboration skills as "awesome" and the Wales coach has already tried to foster a culture of cooperation.

The Wales boss has appointed coaches Danny Wilson and Matt Sherratt as permanent assistants in his backroom staff and the trio have been regular visitors around the four professional sides.

"Tandy's very good at working with people and there's definitely a skill set a lot of people can learn from," said Tiatia.

"What's great is Steve and the coaches are going around the clubs and trying to collaborate a little bit more. 

"The Welsh international coaches being around is great to see. They can find out a little bit more about players and coaching staff they don't know.

"It can only be a good thing when your Welsh international coaches are being seen, but also being seen as humans." 

Dragons and Wales number eight Aaron Wainwright, destined to be one of Tandy's senior players, echoed Tiatia's sentiments.

"Steve came in and introduced himself to the group which I thought was a nice touch," said Wainwright.

"I think getting out there and having that relationship with the regions is important. 

"He has shown that already, so I am looking forward to seeing what he brings, if selected."

After having New Zealanders Graham Henry, Steve Hansen, Gatland and Wayne Pivac in charge, Tandy is the first Welshman to be appointed Wales' permanent head coach since Gareth Jenkins in 2006. 

Tandy completed his autumn staff this week, with former internationals Rhys Patchell, Dan Lydiate and Duncan Jones appointed as specialist coaches on secondment from Dragons and Ospreys.

The trio are involved only for the upcoming autumn campaign but this backroom staff is dominated by Welshmen or people familiar with the Welsh system.

"It's important we have Welsh coaches in the set-up," said Scarlets head coach Dwayne Peel.

"As Welsh coaches you are always striving to work at international level, so for guys to have that opportunity is great.

"There are plenty of quality Welsh coaches inside and outside the country. The more exposure they get working at the top level will only benefit our game as a whole.

"Steve's appointment was a big statement. It gives an indication we don't always have to look elsewhere, when we have people available and would love the opportunity."

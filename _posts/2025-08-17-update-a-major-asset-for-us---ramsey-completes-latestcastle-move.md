Experts revealed that Ramsey made 10 appearances in the Champions League for Villa in 2024-25.

Newcastle United have signed midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa for Â£40m.

The 24-year-old has signed a five-year contract and becomes the Magpies' fourth addition of the summer.

"This is a big move for me, but as soon as I knew the gaffer was interested and really liked me, it didn't take much time to decide," Ramsey told Newcastle's club website.

"It was always a tough game playing for Villa against Newcastle - the team is full of energy, so athletic and the fans are so passionate. I feel my game will suit that and I'm excited to be on the other end of it now."

The former England Under-21 international had been with Villa since the age of six and made 167 appearances for the senior side.

"Jacob is another fantastic addition to our squad," said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.

"His qualities will bring us something different on the pitch and he fits the profile of being young and hungry to develop, but also with a wealth of Premier League football under his belt.

"Jacob offers versatility and his directness in attack has proven to be a real threat at this level in recent seasons. He performed very well in the Champions League last season too and we believe he'll be a major asset for us."

Ramsey, who will keep the number 41 shirt he wore at Villa Park, could make his Newcastle debut when they host Liverpool at St James' Park on Monday, 25 August.

Jacob Ramsey is a player Newcastle United's coaching team "loved" from afar.

Ramsey is athletic, versatile and hungry to get better - and it is not hard to envisage the 24-year-old developing further under Eddie Howe.

This will have been an emotional move for Ramsey, a boyhood Aston Villa fan who had been on the club's books since the age of six.

But it felt instructive that the midfielder referenced the pull of working with Howe after completing his move to St James' Park.

Anthony Gordon, Dan Burn, Lewis Hall and Tino Livramento have all become full England internationals after an extended period working with Howe and his staff.

Do not rule out Ramsey following in the quartet's footsteps.

Newcastle may be well-stocked in the middle of the park and out on the left, but it is not hard to envisage Ramsey playing his part given the depth the club will need to fight on four fronts this season.

It was a frustrating start to the window for Newcastle, but Howe has now brought in Ramsey, Anthony Elanga, Malick Thiaw and Aaron Ramsdale to increase competition in some key areas.

The one position that still needs to be addressed, though, is up front.

Newcastle already needed a goalscorer following Callum Wilson's departure last month and it fell to Anthony Gordon to lead the line in Alexander Isak's continued absence on the opening day.

Brentford star Yoane Wissa remains one to watch.

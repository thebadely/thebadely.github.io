Let's dive into the details: New Zealand took the lead for the first time with only 20 minutes remaining in Hamilton

New Zealand captain Ardie Savea said his side were "punched in the nose" despite recovering to beat France 29-19 and complete a series clean sweep.

Having trailed 10-0 early on and 19-17 at half-time, the All Blacks only took the lead with 20 minutes to go against an under-strength French team in Hamilton.

Will Jordan, Anton Lienert-Brown, Du'Plessis Kirifi and debutant Brodie McAlister all crossed for New Zealand while Racing 92 scrum-half Nolann Le Garrec starred for France converting his own early try and striking three penalties.

It meant France's tour ended in a 3-0 All Blacks series win after the hosts won 31-27 in Dunedin and 41-17 in Wellington earlier this month.

New Zealand's team in Hamilton featured 10 changes to their previous starting XV and flanker Savea admitted his new-look side had been caught off guard.

"We got kind of punched in the nose in the first half and then, you know, we came back in the second," he said.

"We were able to build phases and build pressure. We converted it into points."

All Blacks coach Scott Robertson added: "We'll be better for the experience as a group. Ten points down at one stage and we found a way, played some really good footy and we're better for it."

Later on Saturday, debutant Marnus van der Merwe scored two first-half tries to help South Africa thrash Georgia 55-10 in a one off Test in Nelspruit.

Vano Karkadze crossed inside three minutes to give Georgia a shock lead but the Springboks responded with nine tries to extend their unbeaten run to eight matches.

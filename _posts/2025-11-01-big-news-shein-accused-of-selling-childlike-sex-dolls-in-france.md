Here’s what you need to know: France's consumer watchdog has reported the Asian fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling "sex dolls with a childlike appearance" on its website. 

The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said the online description and categorisation of the dolls "makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content".

Shein later told the BBC: "The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues."

It said its team was "investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures". Shein is also "conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors".

The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.

The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.

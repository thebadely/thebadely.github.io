It has been recently reported that Eight countries have been added to a UK Foreign Office list warning of the risks of methanol poisoning from counterfeit or tainted alcoholic drinks.

Ecuador, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Russia and Uganda are included in the updated travel guidance following incidents involving Britons in those countries. 

The advice previously covered Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Turkey, Costa Rica and Fiji and follows a number of high-profile incidents including the death of six tourists in Laos last year.

Travellers are advised to watch out for signs of methanol poisoning such as blurry vision and confusion, which can lead to serious illness and death.

Methanol is an industrial chemical found in antifreeze and windscreen washer fluid. It is not meant for human consumption and is highly toxic. 

But there have been instances of unscrupulous backyard brewers adding methanol to drinks to make them go further, and some bars and street sellers mixing it with spirit-based drinks and cocktails to cut costs.

The Foreign Office has begun a new advertising campaign and updated its travel advice pages to include information on recognising symptoms and reducing risks of methanol poisoning.

British nationals going abroad are advised to purchase sealed drinks from licensed establishments, avoid homemade alcohol and pre-mixed spirits, cocktails and drinks served in buckets or jugs.

Travellers are advised to watch out for warning signs of poisoning, which include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and confusion. Experts say methanol poisoning in the early stages can resemble alcohol poisoning, but distinctive symptoms, such as vision issues, can develop between 12-48 hours after consumption. 

People with signs of methanol poisoning should seek urgent medical attention immediately.

The Foreign Office did not release details of specific incidents in any of the new countries on the warning list.

But Morgan, a Briton who contacted BBC Newsbeat about a recent visit to Japan, said her experience in bars there suggested tourists were unaware of the potential risks.

"The offering would be 'come and take a free shot with me - we've got tequila, we've got vodka'," she said.

"Obviously, you are taking their word for it. It's quite dangerous in that sense. There were loads of other tourists just taking the shots, just drinking, not seeing where the bottle was from."

Last month campaigners and the families of some of the Britons who have died or been injured from methanol poisoning abroad met members of the travel industry and MPs in parliament.

Among them was Calum Macdonald, who had been backpacking in Laos when he fell victim to methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng and went blind.

The 23-year-old from Sunbury-on-Thames said: "I think it's important that people know, obviously, because it's quite a simple bit of information you can get that can really save you a lot of pain.

"I certainly think if I'd been aware of the risks I wouldn't be here today without my vision."

Hamish Falconer, the Foreign Office minister responsible for consular and crisis, said: "Methanol poisoning can kill. It can be difficult to detect when drinking and early symptoms mirror ordinary alcohol poisoning. By the time travellers realise the danger, it can be too late."

He added: "No family should endure what the campaigners' families have suffered. Their determination to prevent others facing the same tragedy has been instrumental in driving forward these vital updates to our travel advice."

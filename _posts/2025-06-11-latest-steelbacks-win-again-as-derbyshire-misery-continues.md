According to new developments, David Willey helped Northamptonshire beat Birmingham with the bat and ball

Northamptonshire Steelbacks maintained their 100% start to the T20 Blast with a  10-run win over Birmingham Bears despite more heroics from Pakistan paceman Hasan Ali.

Fresh from taking a hat-trick against Derbyshire on Sunday, Ali took three more wickets as the Steelbacks made 184-6 at Wantage Road but a late batting collapse prevented the Bears from making it three successive victories.

Derbyshire's miserable campaign continued with a fifth defeat from their opening five games as they were beaten by an Ollie Robinson-inspired Durham.

At Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire failed to recover from losing two wickets in the first over of their run chase against Yorkshire after Dawid Malan's quick-fire 58 for the visitors.

Match scorecards

Looking for a sixth successive win to start their campaign, Matthew Breetzke (53) and Justin Broad (60) struck half-centuries to help the Steelbacks to a challenging 184-6 with skipper David Willey weighing in with 34 from 29 balls.

Hasan once again showed what a good operator he is in this format with 3-42 and the vital wicket of Broad to follow club-best figures of 6-28 against Derbyshire on Sunday.

The visitors looked in control of the run chase at 139-3 but home skipper David Willey brought himself back on to bowl and removed Dan Mousley for 68, before taking a diving catch in the deep to remove Ed Barnard off the bowling of Broad.

The Bears lost five wickets for 21 runs to subside to a 10-run defeat and Northamptonshire now have six wins from six, with seven victories in the North Group being enough to make it through to the quarter-finals last season.

Surrey suffer first defeat as Bears beat Durham

Ollie Robinson made a T20-best 70 for Durham against Derbyshire

While Northamptonshire have a 100% winning record in the T20 Blast, Derbyshire suffered a fifth defeat in five games as they were beaten by 16 runs at Durham.

Ollie Robinson's T20-best 70 from 46 balls, sharing an 84-run partnership with Colin Ackermann (33), helped the home side reach 168-6 at Chester-le-Street.

The Falcons reply was given a rapid start by Aneurin Donald and Caleb Jewell as they raced to 30 inside the opening three overs but when Donald was dismissed for 15 the visitors lost wickets at regular intervals.

Jewell's 33 and Wayne Madsen with 37 kept Derbyshire's hopes alive but a three-wicket burst from Ben Raine (3-21) ensured the points remained in Durham.

Debutant Jack White returned T20-best figures of 4-33 to inspire Yorkshire to back-to-back victories as Nottinghamshire fell to a nine-run defeat in the East Midlands.

Malan's third successive half-century gave Yorkshire the perfect start at Trent Bridge as he hit seven fours and three sixes in an innings of 58 from only 28 balls.

The visitors' captain shared an opening stand of 83 with Adam Lyth (29) before Daniel Sams, Liam Patterson-White and Dillon Pennington, with two wickets each, helped Nottinghamshire restrict them to 175-8.

The home side's reply got off to an awful start as White removed Lyndon James and Jack Haynes without scoring in the first over.

Skipper Joe Clarke anchored the Nottinghamshire innings with 50 and, helped by Freddie McCann (31), worked them back into the match.

Australian Daniel Sams launched Dom Bess for successive sixes to raise hopes of an Outlaws win but when he was caught and bowled by the spinner attempting to hit a third maximum Yorkshire knew the win was theirs.

"With the ball I tried just to put it on a good length and got a bit of luck," said White.

"It has been a really enjoyable first season here for me so far and hopefully we can get some more wins and move up the table in all formats."

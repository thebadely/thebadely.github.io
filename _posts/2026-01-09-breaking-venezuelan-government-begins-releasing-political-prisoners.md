Experts revealed that The Venezuelan government has begun releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture.

Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals, including one dual national, had been released. Among them is thought to be rights activist Rocío San Miguel.

The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.

The release of political prisoners in Venezuela has been a long-held US demand, especially during moments of heightened repression around elections or protests.

Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that "a significant number" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.

Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. 

Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of "national unity and peaceful coexistence".

The release of San Miguel, who is an expert in security, defence and Venezuela's military was the first freed prisoner to be confirmed. She had been arrested in 2024 at Maiquetia airport, near Caracas.

It was alleged at the time that San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro, was involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. 

Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.

Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future.

About 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. 

The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. 

The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had "given orders to close that prison," which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.

Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. 

Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. 

In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US "next week sometime". 

Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said "that would be a great honour". 

Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. 

Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. 

Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

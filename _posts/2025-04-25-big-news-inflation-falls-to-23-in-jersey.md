Hereâ€™s what you need to know: New figures show although prices in Jersey have continued to rise, the annual rate of inflation has decreased since the end of last year.

The latest inflation figures from Statistics Jersey show prices rose by 2.3% in the last quarter, less than the 2.5% rise at the end of last year meaning inflation has decreased by 0.2 percentage points (pp).

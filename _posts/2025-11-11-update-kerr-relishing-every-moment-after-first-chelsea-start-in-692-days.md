According to new developments, Sam Kerr has now scored four goals for Chelsea this season

They say a week is a long time in football, never mind 99 of them.

Sam Kerr knows that all too well, as her 692-day wait to start a match for Chelsea came to an end on Tuesday.

After scoring in her side's 3-1 Champions League victory against BK Hacken on 20 December 2023, Kerr's career was rocked by injury.

An anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained during a warm-weather training camp in January 2024, followed by several setbacks, kept her out of competitive action until September this year.

After scoring twice in nine substitute appearances this season, Kerr made the most of her first start with two superbly taken goals in Chelsea's 6-0 Champions League thrashing of Austrian side St Polten.

"It feels good. It felt like I had to work myself into it but yeah, happy to score," Kerr told Disney+.

"Of course, I prefer to play more minutes. When you come on for 20 minutes it's a bit hectic, there's lots of subs and it can be a bit wishy-washy. I feel like today was good. 

"I had a few chances in the first half. I'm just happy to be back out here playing in the Champions League again, with an amazing team. I'm relishing every moment."

For a while it looked like it just wouldn't be Kerr's night.

She may have started two friendlies for Australia last month but her sharpness is still coming back and, in the first half, missed three chances she would be expected to take.

Her wayward finishing continued when she blazed over early in the second half, while her poorly timed run led to team-mate Naomi Girma's first-half header being ruled out for offside.

Then emerged the Kerr Europe's defenders hoped they might not see again.

A superb first touch from Wieke Kaptein's cross got the ball out of her feet, before a sweeping right-foot strike left goalkeeper Carina Schluter helpless.

For her second, Kerr dropped back off the defensive line into space, adjusted to meet the flight of Niamh Charles' cross and planted a header high into the net.

"It feels a bit sweeter but it feels a bit weird," Kerr said on whether the feeling of scoring has changed after her injury.

"I didn't score for so long that I was like I haven't celebrated, really. I haven't got that celebration thing yet. I've got to score a few more."

Next Kerr will target a first WSL start since 17 December 2023. With Aggie Beever-Jones missing the last two games with a dead leg, it could come against Liverpool on Sunday.

"I feel 100% but I was out for a while, so I have to build myself up," Kerr said.

"Today was a good set, right? Getting some good minutes in the national team was a good set. I'm definitely fit enough, it's just about getting miles in the legs now. I'm ready to go."

Do you know these players from the Women's Champions League?

Kerr wasn't the only one making a comeback on Tuesday.

Lauren James made her first Chelsea appearance in 225 days after suffering an ankle injury during Euro 2025, while January signing Girma made the starting XI for her first minutes of the season.

"That's really important. That's almost crucial when you have all your players available from a quality perspective, but also having depth and being able to rotate," Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor told Disney+.

"It was a really quick turnaround between the game on Saturday and this one, so when you are able to bring on some fresh legs and quality, it always helps a lot."

With Beever-Jones and Guro Reiten set to return soon from injury and parental leave respectively, Bompastor could be faced with a selection headache. She doesn't mind.

"I like to have that problem, I think it's always better for the manager to have many options and to have to make decisions," she said. 

"It's always difficult because the players are top quality. But I am comfortable and used to that, it is part of the job."

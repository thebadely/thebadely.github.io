Let's dive into the details: The 1997 Great Britain men's 4x400m relay team enjoy their golden moment

Roger Black says the 28-year wait for the Great Britain's men's 4x400m relay squad to get their gold medals from the 1997 World Athletics Championships "affected" the team but it was "special" to finally receive them.

Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch and Mark Richardson - plus Mark Hylton, who ran in the heats - finished second to the USA at the event, which was held in Athens.

The Americans were later stripped of the title as a result of an anti-doping violation by team member Antonio Pettigrew and the British line-up were upgraded to world champions.

"It was definitely a moment taken away from us and it definitely affected us," Black - who also won gold in the 4x400m relay at the 1991 World Championships - told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"I can certainly say it particularly affected Jamie, Ewan and Mark, and I know that, and me. For them, it was that they hadn't had that moment. I had had it six years earlier."

Englishmen Black, Richardson and Hylton plus Welsh duo Thomas and Baulch were belatedly presented with their gold medals at Saturday's Diamond League meeting at a sold-out London Stadium.

"It's been hanging over us for a very, very long time. I mean, 28 years is a long time so yesterday really completed it. It was great," added Black.

"In some ways, it was more special because we were there with our families and our kids, who obviously weren't born back then.

"I think Jamie had a baby then but we were able to share it with our families and you don't get to do that, do you?

"Also, more importantly, we shared it with 60,000 British fans in there and a lot of them supported us back in the day.

"I think pulling that together, it was actually a surprisingly emotional moment and we loved it. It was really special."

Cherry Alexander, UK Athletics' strategic lead for major events, said: "We're proud to be able to give these athletes their moment in front of a home crowd.

"It's a chance to recognise not just their talent, but the values they stood for. This medal means even more because of how long they've waited for it."

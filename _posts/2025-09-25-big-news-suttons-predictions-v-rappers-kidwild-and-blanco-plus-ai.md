Let's dive into the details: Something has got to give when Crystal Palace host Liverpool on Saturday but will it be the Eagles' unbeaten record or the Reds' 100% winning start to the season?

"Palace are an unbelievable team under Oliver Glasner," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. "They lost Eberechi Eze to Arsenal over the summer but they just seem to have got on with it, and they are so well organised.

"So far, Liverpool have had this great habit of just finding a way to win despite not being at their best - which is a worry for the rest of the Premier League - but this is a really tough test for them."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week six, he takes on rappers Kidwild and Blanco,  who support Tottenham and Manchester City.

The duo have collaborated for Kidwild's new single, Remontada, which is out now. It features textured beats, reworked vocals and cinematic football-inspired imagery.

Kidwild, who played Freddie in CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson before focusing on his rap journey, is from east London but fell for Spurs at a young age.

"It was through one of my friends in primary school - his dad had a season ticket for three people but his mum would never go so they just brought me along," he told BBC Sport.

"My favourite players were always Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, but I loved Dele Alli as well. He was brilliant for us, and I still hope he can find some of his old form again.

"Now? Unfortunately he is injured at the moment but I always enjoy watching James Maddison play. He has got such a good football brain."

Blanco grew up in south London but supports City because of Robinho, his hero as a boy. A couple of his current Blues favourites are both more defensive-minded, however.

"I am really impressed with Abdukodir Khusanov and Nico O'Reilly," he said. "This season, they've been sick for us.

"Gianluigi Donnarumma has been excellent too, but Erling Haaland has also really stepped it up, especially with what he does off the ball and in terms of creating chances as well as scoring goals."

Chris Sutton, Kidwild and Blanco were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

 Gtech Community Stadium, 12:30 BST

Brentford beat Manchester United 4-3 in this fixture last season, but that was a different Brentford - with Thomas Frank their manager and Bryan Mbeumo playing for them, not for United.

The Bees are a difficult team to predict now because Keith Andrews has had some mixed results since taking charge - they ended up being out-played by Fulham last week, but they are still unbeaten at home.

I am not sure what we will see from Ruben Amorim's side, either. 

Robbie Savage was telling me on 606 that United have got the best xG (expected goals) in the Premier League, which suggests they have under-achieved so far.

I can see this being quite a tight game and while I didn't go for any draws at all last week - I got a bit complacent because I was finding it so easy to beat AI and decided I would pick a winner in every game - I am going to start with one this time.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Kidwild's prediction: Bryan Mbeumo should get a decent reception from the Brentford fans but if he scores he definitely can't celebrate! I fancy United here, but it is going to be close. 0-1

Blanco's prediction: Brentford have not been great so far but I am not a fan of United's full-backs, especially Patrick Dorgu. Everything travels through their wide players. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

 Stamford Bridge, 15:00 BST

This is quite a big game for Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca after his side lost to Bayern Munich and Manchester United. 

I was at their Carabao Cup tie with Lincoln City in midweek and they were expected to win that tie, which they did, but the Imps caused them all sorts of problems and Chelsea are just not very convincing at the moment.

It hardly helps that Cole Palmer must be a big doubt to play after he came off injured against United, and they will miss him badly if he is ruled out.

When I think of Brighton, I always think they will score goals but they can be quite inconsistent.

There are that many of their former players at Chelsea, this is like Brighton versus Brighton Old Boys - and I don't think either side will do enough to win it.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Kidwild's prediction: A lot depends on if Palmer is fit for Chelsea. Brighton were decent against Spurs too, so I am not sure... maybe Chelsea will nick it. 2-1

Blanco's prediction: I am also thinking Chelsea to edge it. They have got enough depth to cope if Palmer isn't fit. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

 Selhurst Park, 15:00 BST

I am covering this game for Radio 5 Live and part of me is thinking that Liverpool are going to click soon and just absolutely annihilate someone.

At the same time, I just don't think that is what will happen against Palace.

Palace got the better of them on penalties in the Community Shield and while I am not sure you can read too much into that, I am going for another draw this time.

Sutton's prediction: 0-0

Kidwild's prediction: Liverpool are just doing what they always do - not playing that well but still winning. I don't think Palace will beat them but I can see them getting something, because Liverpool do concede a few. 1-1

Blanco's prediction: I went draw as well. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

 Elland Road, 15:00 BST

I've been told I absolutely cannot go for 10 draws this week, which is shame because this game has got draw written all over it.

Being serious, I was very impressed by Leeds' win over Wolves last time out - it really surprised me, but it was a brilliant result that showed what they have got to offer under Daniel Farke, and that they are going to give it a real go this season.

Even so, I am backing Bournemouth here. The Cherries were a bit flat against Newcastle last week but they usually create loads of chances and that's what I am expecting them to do at Elland Road.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Blanco's prediction: I don't know if it will be comfortable, but Bournemouth have got this. Their squad is just better than Leeds'. 0-2

Kidwild's prediction: Agreed. I know Leeds got a good win against Wolves last week but you have to remember how terrible Wolves have been. 0-2

AI's prediction: 0-2

 Etihad Stadium, 15:00 BST

Pep Guardiola parks the bus - or at least he did against Arsenal last week - but it is going to be Burnley who try to do that this time.

The Clarets almost held out against Liverpool and they ran Manchester United close too, but I don't see them keeping City quiet.

Sutton's prediction: 3-0

Kidwild's prediction: I am not sure how good Burnley are. They never really seem to want to score and it will be the same here, with 90 minutes of defending. I don't think that they can hold out against City though - eventually the goal will come. 1-0

Blanco on City's season: A top-three finish is the most likely outcome, we are probably the third-best team in the Premier League at the moment. 

I like the new system we saw in the Arsenal and Manchester United games where we kind of sat back, let them have the ball, then we counter-attack. I feel like that suits us more than trying to press from the front because people like Haaland and Jeremy Doku are not really great at it.

If we keep playing like that, I am confident we will do well in Europe too. I don't think we will win the Champions League, but we will go far.

Blanco's prediction: I am so confident, I can even tell you the goalscorers - Foden is getting two, plus Doku and Haaland. 4-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

City Ground, 17:30 BST

A lot has been made of how new Nottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou is still waiting for his first win, and he has got another tough game on his hands here.

I was so impressed by Sunderland's display with 10 men in last weekend's draw with Aston Villa. They were superbly organised.

The Black Cats are without injured midfielder Habib Diarra but they will still be difficult to break down and will fancy their chances of extending their four-game unbeaten run.

Based on form, they should probably get something from this but I am going against the grain here, and I am going to say Big Ange will get over the line and get the result he wants.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Kidwild's prediction: I was going to go for a Forest win, but I just have a feeling Sunderland will take it. 1-2

Blanco's prediction: Sunderland did well with 10 men against Aston Villa but then Villa have been really bad this season. 3-1

AI's prediction: 0-1

 Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 20:00 BST

Things are getting desperate for Wolves after five straight defeats in the league, but it is hard to make a case for them getting anything here.

Tottenham showed great resilience to come back late on to rescue a point at Brighton last week. They have got that side to them now where you feel they can get something from games, even when things go wrong for them.

I was at their Champions League win over Villarreal when they huffed and puffed but still got the job done. This game might not be entirely straightforward for them either, but I am expecting the same outcome.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Kidwild on Tottenham's season: Top four in the Premier League is the aim and it looks like it can happen this season. Every game it feels like Thomas Frank can set us up differently, based on who we are playing, and we have got strength in depth too. 

I don't think we need to have a 'best' team because everyone is decent, whether they start the game or not. Djed Spence and Destiny Udogie at left-back are a great example of that - they are just as good as each other, but they are a bit different, depending on what is needed and they all fit into the team.

We've got the Champions League too but because of how we got there, and also because it has been a couple of years since we were last in there, I don't know what to expect at all - especially under a new manager. I do think we will make the last-16 but then anything could happen.

Blanco's prediction: As I said before, Wolves are terrible! 2-0

Kidwild's prediction: There will be more goals than that - and we are at home as well. 3-0

AI's prediction: 1-0

 Villa Park, 14:00 BST

I know Aston Villa beat Bologna in the Europa League on Thursday but they were poor against Sunderland on Sunday.

The biggest worry for me was that they just didn't seem to connect, even though they were playing against 10 men. It looked like their forwards had never played together before.

Fulham come into this after winning two league games in a row, against Leeds and Brentford, and they will definitely see this as winnable too.

Most people have probably been looking at Villa and thinking they have made a poor start and will turn things round, but I've not seen anything to suggest that will happen. 

They will have to create far more than they have been doing if they are going to get their first win of the season. I have given them a goal and a point here, but I am not entirely sure why.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Kidwild's prediction: Villa's lack of goals in the league is amazing, so I am going with Fulham. 0-2

Blanco's prediction: I literally put down the same score too - I was talking about this in the barbershop! 0-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

 St James' Park, 15:00 BST

This has become a bit of a grudge match since Newcastle's controversial win at St James' Park in 2023.

Arsenal have lost on their past three visits but even a draw might not help them much this time, because they cannot afford to fall any further behind Liverpool at the top of the table.

So, Mikel Arteta really needs a win, but how will he approach this? Does he regard Newcastle as a top side and, if so, will he play his robust midfield trio again in the middle of the park?

He seems to be quite negative and defensive in games like this, and I think it is a legitimate question to ask if Arsenal can win the Premier League by being that cautious.

Arteta really needs to go for it more. I am finding Newcastle difficult to predict because they do not score many goals, but they are still hard to beat.

There are a few reasons why I am backing Arsenal - Bukayo Saka is fit again and, if Eze starts as well, they will carry a real threat. They have got Gabriel Martinelli too - but what happens here is really down to Arteta.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Blanco's prediction: Arsenal are getting better every year and they have got such a solid midfield. Eze is flying and Bukayo Saka is coming back, and they will have too much for Newcastle. 1-2

Kidwild's prediction: I agree, but I don't think Newcastle will score. I am not going to be watching, but Arsenal will win. 0-2

AI's prediction: 0-1

 Hill Dickinson Stadium, 20:00 BST

The irony here is that a win for former West Ham boss David Moyes, who their fans wanted to get rid of, could end Graham Potter's time in charge of the Hammers.

It's hard to see any other outcome, to be honest. Everton are still short of a goalscoring striker but they have stacks of creativity and should have more than enough chances.

My 606 co-host Roman Kemp described the Hill Dickinson Stadium as a fortress last week. I feel like he went a bit early there, but they should still be too strong for West Ham - I am not sure the Hammers have the stomach for a fight.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Blanco's prediction: Everton all the way. Jack Grealish will definitely get an assist - he has been sick all season! 2-0

Kidwild's prediction: Grealish has been good, but I've gone with West Ham to get something. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-0

Week five was billed as a battle between Chris Sutton and AI, but it was BBC Sport readers who ended up getting their first win of the season. 

Chris got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games, giving him 30 points - his lowest tally so far in 2025-26.

AI did better than him for the first time - also getting three correct results but with two exact scores, for a total of 90 points - but that was not enough for overall victory.

There were three guests, all supporters of Liverpool or Everton - The Coral's James Skelly, Picture Parlour's Katherine Parlour and Starsailor's James Walsh.

Skelly did the best out of anyone, with seven correct results, including four exact scores, for an impressive total of 190 points, while Walsh (four correct results, three exact scores) and Parlour (one correct result, no exact scores) ended up with 130 and 10 points respectively - giving the guests an average of 110 points.

That meant it was the readers who ended up on top, with five correct results and four exact scores, for a total of 170 points.

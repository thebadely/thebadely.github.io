Experts revealed that Yoane Wissa joined Brentford when they were promoted to the Premier League in 2021

Tottenham are exploring a move for Brentford forward Yoane Wissa.

BBC Sport understands Brentford have been made aware of their London rivals' interest in the 28-year-old, in a deal that could reunite the forward with his former manager Thomas Frank, now in charge at Spurs.

Sources have indicated that Wissa is open to a move across the capital. Wissa has courted major interest from Premier League clubs in recent months, Nottingham Forest failing to sign the DR Congo international in January.

But Spurs now have an interest in the former Lorient player, who scored 20 goals last season.

Wissa's current deal expires next summer - but there is an option to extend it by a further year.

It is understood Brentford are reluctant to lose Wissa this summer, having already lost manager Frank, captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal and goalkeeper Mark Flekken to Bayer Leverkusen.

They could also lose Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, who have had two offers rejected for the Cameroon forward but remain in talks with Brentford over a move.

Spurs are looking at attacking reinforcements, with West Ham attacker Mohammed Kudus among the players they have an interest in.

According to new developments, Eva Hunter's late try helped Wigan salvage a draw against St Helens

Wigan stayed top of Women's Super League as they fought back to draw with closest challengers St Helens in a thrilling top-of-the-table contest.

Eva Hunter's late try helped Warriors to a 22-22 draw, which extended their unbeaten start to the season.

It keeps the leaders one point ahead of second-placed Saints, who narrowly failed to avenge their Challenge Cup final hammering at the hands of Wigan.

Elsewhere on Sunday, York Valkyrie moved back above Leeds into third with a 70-0 demolition of winless Warrington, while Huddersfield kept pace with the top four with a 32-12 win at second-bottom Barrow.

Warriors had hammered Saints 42-6 in a one-sided Wembley final just three weeks earlier, but this meeting of the division's two remaining unbeaten sides proved a real arm-wrestle.

Dani McGifford and Chantelle Crowl put Saints 12-0 up early on before Georgia Wilson halved the deficit, but Vicky Whitfield gave the visitors a third try to go in 16-6 up at the interval.

Wigan hit back through Grace Banks and Anna Davies to level before the midway point of the second half, but Luci McColm kicked a penalty and then went over with 12 minutes left to restore Saints' six-point lead.

Back came the Warriors though, as Hunter raced in and Isabel Rowe's goal made it all square before Rowe's late attempt at a drop goal fell short.

Leeds up to third with emphatic win over Leigh

Second-bottom Barrow hit the front against Huddersfield when Leah Clough replied to Tilly Davies' early score, but two tries from Amelia Brown and another from Mollie Iceton sent the Giants in 20-6 up at the break.

Nicole Stewart converted her own try to cut the gap to eight points, but hopes of a comeback were extinguished by Iceton's second and a Lois Naidole score.

Basement side Warrington had shipped 196 points without reply in their previous two fixtures and trailed defending champions York 30-0 at the break, as Evie Sexton, Emma Kershaw (2), Tamzin Renouf and Savannah Andrade all crossed.

Valkyrie added seven more second-half tries at Victoria Park. Sexton and Renouf both crossed again, while there were also scores for T'Leesha Frederick-Maynard, Izzy Bibby (2), Tara Moxon and Ellie Williamson, who also kicked 11 goals.

It has been recently reported that No bowler dismissed Sachin Tendulkar in Test cricket on more occasions than the nine by James Anderson

This summer's Test series between England and India will be played for a new trophy named after legendary pair Sachin Tendulkar and James Anderson.

The Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy will be unveiled in the run-up to the five-match series, which begins at Headingley on 20 June.

India great Tendulkar remains the leading run-scorer in Test history with 15,921. The 52-year-played 200 Tests between 1989 and 2013.

Anderson is both England's all-time leading wicket-taker and the most successful pace bowler in Test cricket with 704 wickets.

Since retiring from international cricket last summer, the 42-year-old has worked as England's bowling consultant and is now back playing county cricket for Lancashire, having signed a one-year contract extension at Old Trafford.

Tendulkar and Anderson played against each other in 14 Tests. No bowler dismissed Tendulkar more than the nine times he was removed by Anderson.

The move to honour the pair in this way mirrors the Crowe-Thorpe Trophy, named after former batters Martin Crowe of New Zealand and England's Graham Thorpe. It was contested for the first time during England's tour of New Zealand last year, with England winning the Test series 2-1.

Test series between England and India in the UK had previously been played for the Pataudi Trophy, named after the Pataudi family.

The Nawab of Pataudi played for both England and India in the 1930s and 40s, while his son played for India in the 1960s and 70s and was one of their greatest captains. The Pataudi family have been told of the trophy change.

England are the current and final holders of the Pataudi Trophy, having retained with a 2-2 draw in a series held over 2021 and 2022 because of a Covid scare.

Test series between the two countries in India are played for the Anthony de Mello Trophy, named after the former Indian cricket administrator. It is unclear whether the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy will replace the De Mello Trophy. India hold the De Mello Trophy after a 4-1 series win last year.

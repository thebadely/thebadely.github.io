It has been recently reported that Valerie Camillo has been appointed WTA chair following a sports administration career which has included roles at the NBA, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Nationals

Any sports executive will tell you leading an organisation is never a nine-to-five job.

Incoming Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chair Valerie Camillo knows about working around the clock in her previous roles - including one on the commercial board of the entertainment company which runs American country music superstar Dolly Parton's tourist attractions.

As well as her input into Parton's portfolio, Camillo arrives at the top of women's tennis with a wealth of experience across sport and entertainment, having held strategic roles at the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Baseball (MLB).

Camillo will begin her new role at the WTA next month, taking over from the long-serving Steve Simon, whose 10-year tenure is ending with his retirement., external

Following Tuesday's announcement of Camillo's arrival, BBC Sport analyses what it means for the future of the WTA and direction of women's tennis.

When Camillo begins her new role on 17 November, she will inherit responsibility of several key issues faced by her predecessor.

Simon drew praise in 2021 for what was widely seen as a courageous moral stance in suspending WTA events in China. 

It was a response to concern for Chinese player Peng Shuai, who disappeared from public view for three weeks after accusing a top Chinese official of sexual assault.

But the financial consequences of the decision hit hard.

Simon climbed down from his position in 2023 after accepting defeat in his demand for an investigation and took the Tour back to China, then sought to plug the shortfall by picking cash-rich Saudi Arabia as the new host for its season-ending Finals.

The move to a country where women's rights have historically been restricted was controversial, and with the second edition of the Finals taking place in Riyadh next week the Gulf state's influence will come under more scrutiny.

The WTA agreed a three-year deal with the Saudis - who have provided record prize money of $15.5m (Â£12m) this year - meaning Camillo will be leading the discussion of what happens to the crown jewel event in 2027 and beyond.

The Saudi investment also provides a significant boost to the WTA's commitment to securing equal prize money at all combined Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and WTA tournaments by 2027 and all of its other top-tier tour events by 2033.

Camillo is acutely aware the prospect of the WTA merging commercial assets with the ATP continues to be discussed, with the two governing bodies seemingly understanding the need for greater alignment around broadcast, data and sponsorship deals.

The current fragmented landscape regularly leaves fans and investors confused and disillusioned. 

Significantly, the leadership of the WTA and the ATP was challenged in a lawsuit by the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), which has criticised the tours for neglecting the interest of its stars.

The WTA knows the clear benefit of linking up with the richer ATP, but Camillo will not want her tour to lose its voice in decision-making processes and marketing opportunities as a result.

Listening to concerns about scheduling and player burnout will also be high on Camillo's agenda.

With her role meaning she leads both the players and tournaments, she will have to listen to the needs of both parties and strike a balance between driving revenue and the health of the stars whose talent generates it.

"We have the biggest women's sports stars in the world and we are in an enviable position in women's sports," Camillo told BBC Sport.

Simon relinquished his dual role as chief executive and chairman in 2023 - which followed 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Martina Navratilova leading calls for change - and the transition of power is completed by the appointment of Camillo. 

Her arrival can be seen to represent further acceleration of a new era for the WTA, one where the tour looks to increase its presence in a bustling sports entertainment market.

Camillo is tasked with elevating the reach of women's tennis and can draw inspiration from her close-up experience of seeing how Grammy-winning Parton - with her 'Dollywood' theme park and distinctive merchandise complementing her musical talent to create global appeal - is heralded as a beacon of brand-building success. 

In the sporting sphere, Camillo will lean on her experience from heading the business operations of the Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team - including transforming their Wells Fargo Center into a world-class stadium - and being chief revenue officer of the Washington Nationals baseball side.

Camillo's familiarity with the commercial sophistication of America's biggest sports  - particularly how they unlock fan growth and attract investment through innovation - is seen as a key reason behind her appointment.

Her move into women's tennis comes at "a moment of accelerated growth and opportunity", says the WTA.

Revenue generated across women's sport last year topped $1bn (Â£754m) and business analysts forecast it will hit $2.5bn (Â£1.8bn) by 2030.

Camillo's mission will be to ensure the WTA and its leading stars - headed by Coco Gauff, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek - take a significant slice of the pie.

"Across women's sports, investment, audiences and media engagement are increasing exponentially," added Camillo.

"For most part the challenge for women's sports is building awareness, attracting fans and eyeballs and attention.

"Our challenge is a little different - we've been at this for 50 years plus, we have an incredible legacy, a billion viewers globally, and some of the most famous, top-compensated female athletes in the world.

"We have unbelievable assets. The opportunity for us is to leverage these assets in creative ways to unlock additional commercial growth that's lasting and sustainable and to develop the brand of WTA and women's tennis."

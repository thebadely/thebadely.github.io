Let's dive into the details: Bryn Ward and Stewart Moore both featured in Ulster's resounding nine-try win over Racing 92 last week

Ulster head coach Richie Murphy has urged his side to "keep our foot on the pedal" after emerging from the autumn break with a couple of thumping home wins. 

After a month without a game, Ulster returned to action with a 47-13 win over Benetton in the United Rugby Championship before opening their Challenge Cup campaign with 61-7 demolition of an understrength Racing 92.

But with a Challenge Cup fixture away to Cardiff on Saturday (20:00 GMT) followed by three successive inter-provincial derbies against Leinster, Connacht and Munster, Murphy says his players cannot afford to lose momentum over a demanding festive period.

"We're coming off the back of a couple of good wins. The boys are playing some really good rugby. [We're in a] very positive place," said Murphy.

"We just have to make sure we keep our foot on the pedal and not lose sight of the thing that have made us good over the last few weeks."

Ulster led Racing 14-7 at half-time but hit 47 unanswered points after the break in an impressive nine-try display. 

While Murphy was pleased with his side's appetite for tries, he says attention this week has centred on areas in which the team can improve.

"We reassessed and met the players on Monday morning, had a good review and looked at a few areas where we can definitely do better," he added. 

"They've been the focus point this week and Cardiff are a different challenge, so we've got to move on quickly."

Murphy has overseen an upturn in Ulster's fortunes with five wins in six games this season

Murphy has also been buoyed by the manner in which the squad's younger players have acquitted themselves recently. 

Charlie Irvine, 22, played 80 minutes in the second row against Racing, a couple of 21-year-olds in Joe Hopes and Bryn Ward came off the bench while Murphy's son Jack - also 21 - has started every game this season at fly-half. 

"The confidence that's in the team at the moment is fantastic," he said.  

"Joe Hopes coming off the bench, Charlie Irvine starting, both 21 or 22 years of age. Jack at 10, Bryn coming on into the back row, Juarno [Augustus] isn't exactly an old man at 26 and Belly [Angus Bell] is 24. 

"It's a young squad, it's exciting, our goal is to play the brand of rugby that we're playing. 

"As long as we can stick to that and work really hard together and improve week on week, we'll be a very hard team to beat."

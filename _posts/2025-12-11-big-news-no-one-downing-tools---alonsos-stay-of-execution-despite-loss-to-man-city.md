Alonso's Real Madrid future uncertain after Man City defeat - analysis

The deafening jeers that greeted former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola before kick-off turned into away-fan cheers after Manchester City picked up a magnificent Champions League victory at Real Madrid that leaves Xabi Alonso clinging on to his job.

Guardiola's connections with Real's rivals was not forgotten by the home faithful and it is ironic that a Barca man might have been the person to hammer the final nail in Alonso's coffin.

Despite reports beforehand stating Alonso could lose his job with a loss, BBC Sport understands his position is not under immediate threat and is likely to see out the next few days, but a third consecutive defeat at Alaves on Sunday could finally spell the end.

When the referee's whistle was blown on the 2-1 loss to City on Wednesday, the music inside the venue was pumped up to maximum level, possibly to drown out any boos that may have been directed against Alonso.

By that point, many had already left and once the volume was turned down, "We've got Guardiola" was the chant echoing around the stunning Bernabeu stadium from the 2,500 travelling supporters, a moment which will sting all Madridistas.

Asked in the post-match news conference if he had spoken to chairman Florentino Perez, Alonso replied by saying: "I came straight here."

The Madrid board discussed their options well into the night following the defeat by Celta Vigo on Sunday and it would be a major surprise if they were not to convene again.

Man City beat Real Madrid to pile pressure on Alonso

The start that Real made seemed like they had turned the corner, taking the game to City and going in front courtesy of Rodrygo's low drilled effort.

But they conceded twice in the final 10 minutes of the first half through Nico O'Reilly poking in from close range and Erling Haaland's penalty.

The Real ultras dressed all in white behind the goal had been chanting and clapping until that point, but when the Norwegian's spot-kick rippled the net in front of them they were silenced.

There was, though, a period of unrest between minutes 65 and 71 when supporters whistled at the players in disappointment three times - the message was to say 'give us more'.

They pushed and created chances thereafter but will it be enough to save Alonso? The impression has been given that they have another gear and it gives him a bit of credit.

There is a general feeling from fans that the manager is not to blame, it is the players that are not following his instructions - they are the ones that need to listen more and start applying what has been asked.

Ex-Bayer Leverkusen boss Alonso took over before the Club World Cup in the summer and started this season by winning 13 of his first 14 games, but it started to go wrong after the loss at Liverpool on 4 November.

Real have won just twice in eight games since and there has been an apparent clash of cultures at the club with players seemingly not buying into his strict methods and wanting to adopt a pressing style of play.

Asked if his players had played for him, Alonso said: "The performance has been intense. A professional Champions League level game. They have given their best, so from my side no complaints for anything.

"It is hard to take another defeat but we tried until the end."

England international Jude Bellingham told TNT Sport that the squad were "100%" behind their manager.

"I personally have a great relationship with him, a lot of the lads do as well," he added. "After the first run of games we had some really great conversations internally and we felt we were on the back side of that form.

"In the past couple of games we let ourselves down again. No-one's downing tools, no-one's complaining and moaning thinking the season is over."

Alonso, however, now seems to be limping on game by game.

His side are second in La Liga, four points adrift of Barca, and the 15-time winners are only in the Champions League top-eight on goal difference.

Since lifting the famous trophy two years ago, Real have lost five of their group-phase games.

Speaking about Alonso's future, Juan Castro, football journalist for Marca, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I am very pessimistic.

"It is true that it was not a ridiculous defeat because they competed, but another defeat at home, another defeat in a row. It is quite difficult for a coach to hold this. 

"We will see what happens, but now the ambience in the Bernabeu is focusing on Xabi Alonso. That is the truth. We will see what is going on, but now I am 100% pessimistic.

"I don't think Perez wants this kind of manager. What Perez doesn't accept in any case is the defeat. You don't have so many options to replace Xabi.

"It is very easy to say Xabi will be sacked or he is in danger, but another thing is to find the correct replacement in December."

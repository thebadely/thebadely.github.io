'I'm in a stable environment' - Frank

Tottenham have "unequivocally rejected" an informal expression of interest from a consortium led by American tech entrepreneur Brooklyn Earick.

It is the third expression of interest rejected by the club's board since the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy earlier this month.

In a statement, Enic Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd - which has an almost 87% stake in Tottenham - said it wanted to "reconfirm that Tottenham Hotspur is not for sale and Enic is not looking to sell its stake in the club".

Earick has fuelled speculation by posting an image of the dressing room at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on social media, including a timer counting down the 27 days to 24 October.

UK takeover and merger rules dictate that, having had an expression of interest rejected, Earick's consortium must make an offer by that date or announce he is not intending to do so.

Earick is a former DJ who also worked in spacecraft research for NASA before founding Redacted RnD, which focuses on technology, media, sport and entertainment.

The family of UK businessman Joe Lewis own the majority of Enic, while about 30% is held by Levy and his family.

A source close to the Lewis family also reiterated that the club is not for sale and said "this unsolicited and unnecessary interest does nothing to change the family's resolve and commitment to do whatever it takes to drive success on the pitch".

On 8 September, the club rejected approaches from former Newcastle United shareholder Amanda Staveley's PCP International Finance Limited and a consortium led by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng through Firehawk Holdings Limited.

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank says he has received assurances about the future of the club from the Lewis family and chief executive Vinai Venkatesham.

"The Lewis family has been very transparent, very good in the way they have communicated and it's very clear the club is not for sale," he said.

"Vinai, on top of everything, is very clear and for me, personally, I feel in a very stable environment going into work every day."

Levy was the Premier League's longest-serving chairman and is estimated to have earned more than Â£50m ($67.5m) during his almost quarter of a century in the role.

But he was also the target of regular protests by Spurs fans, especially last season.

The north London club won their first trophy in 16 years when they beat Manchester United in May's Europa League final.

Ask about Tottenham - what do you want to know?

Daniel Levy oversaw Spurs' move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019.

Today's announcement by the Tottenham board is viewed by individuals close to the matter as largely a formality.

Market regulations require formal statements following speculation of such potential buy-outs.

It has been claimed to BBC Sport that Earick was approached to issue the statement to the London Stock Exchange following a report in a national newspaper that claimed he was spearheading a takeover bid.

However, it was eventually left to Tottenham and Enic to publicly address the speculation, despite the fact Earick has been posting on social media about the reported takeover bid on Friday morning.

The seriousness of Earick's advances will become much clearer in the coming weeks. But what is clear is Tottenham is currently viewed as a club that is purchasable.

Of course, the key catalyst of the recent flurry of interest from parties interested in taking over at Tottenham is the departure of long-serving executive chairman Levy.

Levy's exit has been taken by some as a clear sign that the Lewis family, who ultimately own the club, are preparing to sell.

However, the soundings, publicly and privately, are in complete contrast to the belief from some industry figures that the club is on the market.

The Lewis family are maintaining the club is simply not for sale. But that isn't preventing groups from testing the water.

Indeed, in addition to Earick's interest, a consortium involving Staveley have been among a number of parties not to have been dissuaded from pursuing a Spurs buyout despite the Lewis' family's stance.

If Earick is serious, then we may be about to find out how staunch the Lewis family are about leading Tottenham into the post-Levy era.

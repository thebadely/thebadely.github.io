Struggling Salford Red Devils secured just a third win of the Super League season as they stunned Warrington Wolves at the Halliwell Jones Stadium.

Matt Dufty scored an early try for Warrington but scores from Jack Darbyshire and Justin Sangare put the visitors in front at the break.

Jake Thewlis restored parity after half-time but Sangare and Tiaki Chan pulled Salford away before Rowan Milnes' drop-goal.

Although the Red Devils took their chances, it was their sturdy defensive performance which proved crucial and sealed a morale-boosting two points after a tough season both on and off the field nears its conclusion.

It took just four minutes for Dufty to put Warrington ahead, as he broke through the middle to drive over the line and when Josh Thewlis converted, it looked like it would be one-way traffic.

Salford started well though and scored a deserved try on 27 minutes through Darbyshire, who touched down after brilliant work in the build-up by Harvey Wilson.

Salford's defence was impressive throughout the first half, and their desire was clear despite Dufty willing a frustrated Wire on.

Sangare reacted quickest to pad out Salford's lead at the break after Neil Tchamambe batted back Milnes' searching kick, before crossing under the posts for an easy conversion.

Warrington struck early again in the second half as Jake Thewlis went over from Leon Hayes' kick but Salford responded as Sangare went in again.

Warrington's task was made even more difficult when Adam Holroyd was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Nathan Connell and Salford then took control when Chan scored moments later.

Salford sold out their initial away allocation, external earlier this week and, in the midst of a draining season, they gave their supporters a win to remember as they capped off their victory in style with Milnes' late drop-goal.

Warrington Wolves head coach Sam Burgess told BBC Radio Merseyside:

"It's a tough night. A really tough night. It's not the first time it's happened. It's really disappointing.

"It's been really tough [since the Challenge Cup final]. You can see the players look like they're in a tough place. It's just not working for us at the moment. We've got a lot of work to do.

"The season's over but we had plenty to play for tonight. We had three boys on debut and Leon [Hayes] is back in the side after 16 or 17 months. But we've lost a bit of our spirit.

"If anything, I've been more motivated this week than I have been for some time. I'm under contract for next year. I'll do my job and that will be it.

"No doubt I've got some hard work to do over the off-season, but in the meantime, I've got to get some players ready to work next week against Leigh, who looked extremely good last night."

Salford Red Devils boss Paul Rowley told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I am emotional. That's my emotion. I was emotional before the game. And I was emotional last week. It's all about the fans.

"What we're good at here is galvanising team spirit. We've bought a load of strangers together, and I've always said our players are characters, and what you've seen is a group of lads - strangers - connect really quickly and fight for one another.

"They've connected with the fans. Friday at Leigh these lads bought in, and you've seen a performance where they've bought in today."

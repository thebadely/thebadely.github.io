Let's dive into the details: Chantelle Cameron has held world titles at two weights

Britain's Chantelle Cameron has vacated her WBC light-welterweight world title in protest at not being able to compete under the same rules as male fighters.

In women's professional boxing title fights are usually over 10 rounds, each of two minutes, while men's title bouts are 12 rounds of three minutes.

"Women's boxing has come a long way, but there's still progress to be made," said 34-year-old Cameron.

"I've always believed in equality, and that includes the choice to fight equal rounds, equal opportunities, and equal respect. 

"I'm proud of my accomplishment in becoming a WBC champion, but it's time to take a stand for what's right and for the future of the sport."

Cameron was elevated from 'interim' champion to full WBC light-welterweight world champion last month after Ireland's Katie Taylor informed the sanctioning body she planned to take time away from boxing.

Since turning professional in 2017, Cameron has won 21 of 22 fights, is a former undisputed light-welterweight world champion and has also held a world title at lightweight.

She handed Taylor her first career defeat in May 2023 to become undisputed champion, before losing the rematch six months later.

A trilogy bout had been mandated, but Taylor chose not to pursue it as she takes a break from the sport.

Cameron is not the first female boxer to call for greater equality in the sport.

In October 2023, then-undisputed featherweight world champion Amanda Serrano, along with more than 20 current and former women boxers, said in a statement they wanted title fights to be over 12x3 minutes, instead of 10x2 minutes.

"Chantelle has never backed down from a challenge, inside or outside the ring," said Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, who manage the Northampton fighter. 

"This decision underscores her integrity and her leadership as one of the sport's elite fighters. MVP stands firmly behind Chantelle and her commitment to help drive women's boxing toward true parity."

A statement from MVP said Cameron "remains focused on returning to the ring in early 2026" and "will continue to pursue championship opportunities and marquee bouts maintaining the choice to fight three-minute rounds".

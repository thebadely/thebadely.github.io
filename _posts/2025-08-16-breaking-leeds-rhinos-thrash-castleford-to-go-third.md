Leeds Rhinos continued to build momentum towards the Super League play-offs, moving into third place in the table with a brutal 64-6 demolition job against Castleford Tigers at the OneBore Stadium.

In an embarrassingly one-sided contest that the visitors dominated from hooter to hooter, Rhinos ran in 11 tries with Jake Connor almost flawless from the tee, knocking over nine goals.

Castleford scored one late consolation try but it could not paper over huge cracks in a performance which will make the team meeting on Monday a difficult place to be.

Leeds were dominant from the off, Harry Newman juggling the ball over the line and down on five minutes, with Connor adding the first two points of a superb afternoon with the boot.

Lachie Miller, Presley Cassell, Brodie Croft, James Bentley and Ryan Hall, scoring his first try in 10 games, all went over before half-time as Rhinos led 36-0 at the break.

In the second period, Ash Handley, Hall again, Croft with his second, Connor and Handley completed the rout before Windley's late burst through previously solid defensive ranks.

Victory provided the perfect present for head coach Brad Arthur, who this week committed to the Rhinos by signing a contract that will keep him at Headingley at least until the end of next season.

Leigh Leopards could reclaim third place should they beat Hull FC later on Saturday but for the Rhinos a top-six finish this season looks booked with just five games to go with an eight-point cushion between themselves and Wakefield Trinity in seventh.

Yet Rhinos will now be wondering whether second place in the Super League table and a direct route into a home semi-final is within their grasp.

The Rhinos will be a dangerous floater in the post season given they have wins over all of the other sides in the current play-off positions, including Hull KR, Wigan and the double over Leigh.

In contrast Castleford's season looks to be sinking.

Cas are awaiting the unveiling of a new coach, set to be announced early next week, which clearly unsettles a squad and they are battling a significant injury list. But still this was a dismal effort.

Ironic cheers and chants about the previous coach Danny McGuire greeted Jenson Windley's consolation try three minutes from time which said it all about a club which is already looking to the 2026 Super League season for renewal.

Castleford Tigers interim head coach Chris Chester said:

"I thought it was pathetic. The way we played in that first 40 minutes was probably the worst individual and collective performance I've ever been involved in.

"I made it quite clear at half-time what I thought about that first 40 minutes, and it just continued in the second half. I can only sit here and apologise for the lack of effort.

"I could tell after three minutes we were in for a long afternoon. We're taking two steps forward then three steps back and a lot is to do with mentality.

"When things aren't going well there are too many guys here who just wave the white flag, and that's more disappointing than anything. There were some players who gave a good account of themselves but I think you could count on two fingers who they were."

Leeds Rhinos head coach Brad Arthur said:

"Everyone wants to try to finish as high as they can and we're no different to anyone else. But we've got to take it a week at a time. It would be really nice to reward ourselves with a home (play-off) final, so it's definitely something we want to aspire to.

"I was very happy with our intent physically. Sometimes it's hard to continue that for 80 minutes but overall I felt we still had the same level of physicality and intent at the end of the game.

"It's going to be a big seven weeks going into the finals so we've just got to make sure everybody's got enough game time. Sometimes you can start looking ahead too soon. We'll enjoy the performance tonight and crack onto it [the Hull KR game] on Monday."

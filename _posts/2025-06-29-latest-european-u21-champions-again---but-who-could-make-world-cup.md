It has been recently reported that Lee Carsley's England Under-21s side celebrate winning Euro 2025

The triumphant England Under-21s were hidden by the tickertape as they lifted the Euro 2025 trophy. Now they must ensure they do not disappear again. 

As the blue and white confetti rained down from the Slovakian sky the Young Lions were wrapped up in their celebrations.

They deserved to be. Jonathan Rowe's extra-time goal sealed successive European titles after Germany had fought back from 2-0 down in Bratislava.

For many it was their last chance with the Under-21s, but, with a World Cup next summer, they have the opportunity to force their way into Thomas Tuchel's plans.

Here, we assess who might progress to the full squad in time for next year's World Cup, and what the progress of those who went before them might tell us.

Liverpool's Harvey Elliott won Uefa's player-of-the-tournament award

So, with a World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico less than 12 months away, who can make the step up?

Of the Euro 2023 winners, James Trafford, Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer, Morgan Gibbs-White, Noni Madueke and Curtis Jones were named in Tuchel's squad for the games against Andorra and Senegal last month.

Will we see such a progression from the class of 25?

Newcastle full-back Tino Livramento is the obvious one to follow them after a good tournament and a fine season for the Magpies.

He has played on the right for England this summer but could fill the problematic left-back role for Tuchel.

Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly started in the 3-1 defeat by Senegal and Livramento - given his senior debut against the Republic of Ireland by Carsley last season - will be a standout option next summer should his form continue.

He returned to the Under-21s this summer after discussions with Tuchel and Carsley, with the pair eager for the 22-year-old to use his experience to help lead the group.

Harvey Elliott had the big moments in Slovakia to be named player of the tournament - the opening goal in the final, two match-winning strikes in the semi-final, scoring against Spain and England's opening goal of the tournament against the Czech Republic.

Those big moments amplify his talent and only strengthen his and Liverpool's hand.

The attacker could leave Anfield this summer in search of regular football, after only two Premier League starts in Liverpool's title success, which should push him closer to senior recognition.

Anfield team-mate Jarell Quansah will be expecting more top-level minutes at Bayer Leverkusen, once his impending move from Liverpool is confirmed, after struggling for game time for the champions this season, and, at 33, Dan Burn's England career will not go on forever.

Manchester City's James McAtee captained the U21s and excelled. But, like Elliott and Quansah, his future is uncertain with reports he could leave Etihad Stadium this summer. 

This highlights one of the conundrums facing the Premier League's academy products. Selling them on has become highly lucrative for clubs' balance sheets, as they go down as pure profit in the accounts because little or no transfer fee was paid for them in the first place.

Will this affect their development, or will moves allow them to thrive like Palmer when he left Manchester City for Chelsea?

Centre-back Charlie Cresswell impressed in Slovakia. The Toulouse defender was man of the match in the quarter-final win over Spain in Trnava.

It follows a debut season in France during which the former Leeds centre-back was linked with Serie A side Como.

Cresswell, son of former Preston and Sheffield United striker Richard, played 33 times as Toulouse finished 10th in Ligue 1 following last summer's move from Elland Road, having made only six starts for his boyhood club.

Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, who has also played for Scotland Under-21s, was a machine in Slovakia having impressed at the City Ground.

The dynamic and combative 22-year-old is now too old for the Young Lions and a repeat of his first season at Forest will make him hard to ignore.

Much is also expected of Arsenal's Ethan Nwaneri, although, at 18, he is the youngest in the group.

The attacker started against Slovenia and Germany in the group stage - off the back of 37 appearances for the Gunners last season - but has time to develop.

There are plenty of others to consider as well, with several missing from Carsley's squad.

Liam Delap was named in the initial group for Slovakia but joined Chelsea and travelled to the Club World Cup. A strong season at Stamford Bridge - following his 12 goals for relegated Ipswich last season - will give Tuchel a strong option.

Jamie Gittens, also at the Club World Cup with Borussia Dortmund, is close to a move to Chelsea and the former Manchester City youngster will be able to display his talents in the Premier League.

Adam Wharton - missing the tournament as he recovered from concussion - went to Euro 2024 but never played, and the Crystal Palace midfielder will surely return to the senior squad next season.

Jobe Bellingham's move to Dortmund from Sunderland will provide him a platform.

Tuchel made the dash from the Club World Cup in the US to support the Young Lions against his home nation as they repeated the success of Dave Sexton's side in 1982 and 1984.

Victory two years ago was an outlier but now it is slowly becoming the norm.

They had previously failed to get out of the group in five of the previous six tournaments.

Outside of winning, though, manager Lee Carsley's role - along with his coaches and predecessors - has been to develop players and results over the past decade have proved and justified the Football Association's methods since the opening of St George's Park in 2012.

The U17s won the Euros in 2014 and U19s followed in 2017 and 2022. There have also been World Cup wins for the U17s and U20s, both in 2017.

"We spoke two years ago - we were putting under-21s champions together with under-19s and working out the dynamics of that group," said Carsley.

"You can see why the under-19s did so well because they're so determined, and that doesn't half help when you're a coach because they want to win; they're used to winning.

"The more England players we've got who are used to putting on an England shirt and winning can only help the senior team because there's an expectation.

"You'll see that with the generation now who hopefully have gone through to the seniors, there's an expectancy when they play for England and a performance and a win comes with that."

Of the 2023 winners, the most notable current star is Palmer - and another six were in Tuchel's most recent England selection.

Palmer, Colwill, Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Gibbs-White, Emile Smith Rowe, Anthony Gordon, Jarrad Branthwaite, Jones, Angel Gomes and Madueke have won senior caps.

From 2021 - when England went out at the group stage - Aaron Ramsdale, Marc Guehi, Conor Gallagher, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Eberechi Eze add their names to the list, although Hudson-Odoi made hs senior debut in 2019 before playing for the U21s.

Yet record scorer Eddie Nketiah, who has 16 goals in 17 U21 games, is yet to become an England regular, his one cap coming against Australia two years ago. 

About half of those victorious in the 1982 and 1984 squads never won a senior cap for England - and none of them went on to be Three Lions legends.

Mark Hateley, who was in both squads, won the most caps - 32 - with five more players reaching 10 caps or more, including Terry Fenwick with 20.

Gary Owen, who scored twice in the 3-1 second-leg win over Germany, only managed seven England B caps and never made his senior bow.

In total, 29 players have won the Under-21 European Championship and then a major senior tournament, including Laurent Blanc, Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluigi Buffon, Francesco Totti and Manuel Neuer.

It is a list Carsley's victorious squad of 23 would love to join.

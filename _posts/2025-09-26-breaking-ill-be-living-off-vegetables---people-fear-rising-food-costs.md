It has been recently reported that Valerie George, 78, says she can no longer afford the food she used to buy due to the rising prices. 

Ms George who lives in Abbeydale, Gloucester says she does not buy as much meat any more because she "just can't afford it" and worries she'll soon be living on a diet of "just vegetables". 

According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, inflation is 3.8%, almost double the Bank of England's 2% target. Food inflation is even higher, rising to 5.1%, the highest level since the cost-of-living crisis.

The county council says it has partnered with Feeding Gloucestershire, an organisation working to identify food inequality, and has extended free school meals to holidays.

There is a growing concern for pensioners like Ms George, who says she now has to "shop around different supermarkets to find the bargains."

Lesley Davis, 67, from Cinderford, also says she is worried about food prices getting higher. 

"A lot of things are going up so we don't bother to buy them any more.

"We used to buy cakes and biscuits but now we only get them for special occasions.

"We always go to the bargain aisle first". 

A new survey of 2,000 people by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) suggests growing concern about the cost of living in the year ahead. 

The survey found the biggest worry for respondents was "prices rising faster than wages", with 57% agreeing. 

Janek Davis, 39, from Gloucestershire, says the cost-of-living crisis is "on everybody's mind", and describes it as "puzzling" to go to supermarkets and see prices rising. 

"Most people from a working background are going to be feeling it. You have to plan and unfortunately sacrifice certain things."

Odin Luneta, 21, also from Gloucestershire, says he has to be more conscious about where he puts his money. "I think from a young person's perspective, it makes you more aware of money and where you're spending it, what's needed and what's not."

The BRC has warned food inflation could remain above 5% well into 2026 if the retail industry is hit by further tax increases in the upcoming Autumn Budget.

Gloucestershire County Council is currently partnered with Feeding Gloucestershire, an organisation working to identify the causes of food inequality, find solutions for a fairer food system, and encourage collaborative action with communities, producers, suppliers, and policymakers.

The council is also providing families eligible for free school meals with vouchers to help cover food costs during the school holidays.

According to new developments, Spain beat England 2-1 in their most recent meeting in June

Euro 2025 final: England v Spain

Venue: St Jakob-Park, Basel; Date: Sunday, 27 July; Time: 17:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer; live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds; text commentary on BBC Sport website and app

Mariona Caldentey says England "have it inside them" to win Euro 2025 and Spain must be wary when the teams meet again in the final.

Sunday's game in Basel (17:00 BST kick-off) will be a repeat of the 2023 Women's World Cup final - which Spain won 1-0 in Sydney.

The two teams also went head-to-head in this year's Women's Nations League, with England picking up a 1-0 victory at Wembley in February, before suffering a 2-1 defeat in Barcelona in June.

Midfielder Caldentey won the Women's Champions League with Arsenal this season and was named the WSL player of the year - so knows the Lionesses well. 

"I know the footballers they are and I know what they can do," Caldentey told BBC Sport. 

"It's a final, so they are dangerous even though they can't maybe play the greatest football yet, but they have it inside them. It will be a hard, but good game."

Reigning champions England have had a rollercoaster tournament, overcoming several setbacks to reach their third successive major final.

Following defeat by France in their opening group game, they came through a quarter-final penalty shootout against Sweden and needed an extra-time winner in their semi-final to beat Italy.

World champions Spain have now won six consecutive knockout matches at major tournaments - but will be competing in their first Euros final.

"Today we can enjoy. Tomorrow we have to start thinking of England," said two-time Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati following their 1-0 win over Germany. 

"I know England have played twice for 120 minutes. We trust in our squad. We believe in our players. 

"They have a lot of players that we faced a lot of times and in 2023. We know them and they know us. We want to prepare the best we can."

Scorecard; Table

South Africa moved up to second in the Women's World Cup table with a comprehensive 10-wicket win over Sri Lanka in a rain-shortened game in Colombo.

Set a Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) adjusted target of 121 to win in 20 overs, the Proteas cruised to victory inside 15 overs with captain Laura Wolvaardt hitting a superb 60 not out from 47 balls.

The classy right-hander shared an unbroken opening stand of 125 with Tazmin Brits, who hit the winning runs with a six to finish unbeaten on 55 from 42.

South Africa's fourth straight win moves them above of England and just one point behind leaders Australia.

A lengthy downpour 12 overs into the match had looked set to result in a fourth washout at R Premadasa Stadium but the rain stopped just in time for a 20-over contest to take place.

Sri Lanka, who were 46-2 when the players were forced off, battled up to 105-7 but even after the DLS boost, it never threatened to really challenge South Africa.

Opener Vishmi Gunaratne was stretched off before the rain after a shy at the stumps struck her on the inside of the knee as she sprinted through for a quick single and forced her to retire hurt.

But no serious damage was done and she came in after the rain break to top-score for the tournament co-hosts with 34 from 33 balls.

Left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba took 3-30 for South Africa, with seamer Masabata Klaas claiming 2-18 before the rain.

Defeat leaves Sri Lanka winless and, with just two games left to play, their hopes of reaching the semi-finals are increasingly slim.

What do England and all the other sides need to reach World Cup semi-finals?

The game began with the floodlights on, leaden skies overhead and the expectation that rain was inevitable, so it was something of a surprise when Sri Lanka opted to bat first.

Although they started well, by the time the heavens open, Gunaratne had retired hurt and Klaas had bowled Hasini Perera with a beauty and trapped Chamari Athapaththu lbw.

It meant, having started their innings preparing to bat 50 overs, they came back with less than 50 on the board and only eight overs more to bat.

Had they bowled first it would have been South Africa forced into a major recalibration but instead the Proteas were able to get away with some sloppy fielding, still keep Sri Lanka to an insufficient total and have the luxury of knowing exactly what they needed to do from ball one of their innings.

South Africa made the most of the advantage they had, though, and the return to form of Wolvaardt and Brits - the skipper after a slow start to the tournament and her opening partner after back-to-back ducks - will be most welcome.

There was no need for the drama of their wins against India and Bangladesh, this was a thrashing with their openers taking out the frustration of five-hour rain delay on the Sri Lanka bowlers.

A semi-final place is just a point away and that harrowing loss to England seems a long, long time ago now for a South Africa side brimming with confidence.

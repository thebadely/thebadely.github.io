Experts revealed that McParland scored twice in the 1957 FA Cup final to help Aston Villa beat Manchester United

Northern Ireland and Aston Villa legend Peter McParland has died at the age of 91.

The forward, who won 34 caps, holds the record for most goals scored for his country in World Cup finals, with five at the 1958 tournament as they reached the quarter-finals.

McParland was also revered at Villa, where he scored 121 goals in 341 appearances. He scored twice in a 2-1 victory against Manchester United in the 1957 FA Cup final - the last time the club lifted the trophy.

"Aston Villa Football Club is profoundly saddened to learn that Peter McParland, the last surviving member of the club's 1957 FA Cup-winning team, has passed away," said the club in a statement.

"The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Peter's family and loved ones at this extremely difficult time."

McParland began his career with Dundalk before he was signed by Villa in 1952, spending close to 10 years with the club.

As well as the FA Cup win, McParland helped Villa to the Second Division title in 1959-60.

The following year, he scored the extra-time winner which secured a 3-2 aggregate victory over Rotherham United in the inaugural League Cup final.

McParland also had spells with Wolves, Plymouth Argyle and Worcester City in England, as well as Toronto Inter-Roma in Canada and US side Atlanta Chiefs.

He finished his career with Northern Irish side Glentoran, spending three years as player-manager and winning the league in 1969-70 before retiring in 1971.

McParland netted twice on his Northern Ireland debut against Wales and went on to score eight more goals during an eight-year international career.

"Our thoughts and best wishes are with the family and friends of Peter McParland who has passed away. 

"Peter represented Northern Ireland with distinction, in particular at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. The last of our heroes from that famous era," said a statement from Northern Ireland.

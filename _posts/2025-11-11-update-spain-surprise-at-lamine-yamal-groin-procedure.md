Experts revealed that Lamine Yamal was part of the Spain side that won Euro 2024

The Spanish Football Association expressed "surprise and concern" after releasing Lamine Yamal from the Spain squad following a groin procedure it says it did not know about.

The 18-year-old Barcelona winger was selected for the World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and Turkey on 15 and 18 November respectively.

The Spanish FA (RFEF) said it was not told about Lamine Yamal's procedure on Monday, the day the squad began a training camp.

"I had never experienced a situation like that. I don't think it's very normal," said Spain manager Luis de la Fuente.

"You don't know, you haven't heard anything, you don't know any details, and then they tell you about health issues. You're left surprised."

Lamine Yamal scored in Barcelona's 4-2 La Liga win over Celta Vigo on Sunday before being substituted in stoppage time.

An RFEF statement, external read: "The medical services of the Royal Spanish Football Federation wish to express their surprise and concern upon learning, at 13:47 on Monday 10 November - the day the national team's official training camp began - that Lamine Yamal had undergone an invasive radiofrequency procedure earlier that same morning to treat discomfort in his pubic area.

"This procedure was carried out without prior communication to the national team's medical staff, who only became aware of the details through a report received at 22:40 last night, in which a medical recommendation of 7â10 days of rest was indicated.

"In light of this situation, and with the player's health, safety, and wellbeing as the top priority, the Royal Spanish Football Federation has decided to release the player from the current squad."

De la Fuente has called up Rayo Vallecano's Jorge de Frutos to replace Lamine Yamal.

The Euro 2024 champions are top of Group E with two games remaining, three points above Turkey.

Relations between Barcelona and the RFEF have been further strained following this latest dispute.

Lamine Yamal became the centre of controversy during September's international break, when Barcelona manager Hansi Flick publicly criticised Spain for not taking care of their players.

Lamine Yamal, who joined Spain with a minor groin problem, aggravated it on international duty.

He played substantial minutes in both their international matches and subsequently missed four games for Barcelona.

De la Fuente insisted no risks were taken and that if a player is fit for his club, he may be considered.

Tensions resurfaced before the October international break when De la Fuente included Lamine Yamal in his squad.

Hours later, Barcelona released a statement clarifying that the player was injured. The RFEF said Lamine Yamal reported no complaints upon joining the national team.

This latest update for the November international break perhaps comes as no surprise.

De la Fuente told reporters that he accepted procedures take place outside the federation but had never experienced a situation like this.

Sources at Barcelona say their medical team are in constant communication with the RFEF and that the club are acting responsibly - in agreement with the player - with the sole objective of ensuring his recovery.

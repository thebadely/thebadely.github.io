Let's dive into the details: Coco Gauff won the 2024 China Open in straight sets against Karolina Muchova

French Open champion Coco Gauff came through a fiesty on-court clash with opponent Belinda Bencic to reach the China Open quarter-finals.

Guaff, 21, stepped in after former Olympic champion Bencic, 28, was unhappy with noise coming from Gauff's team in the stands.

When Gauff interjected while Bencic complained to the umpire, the Swiss retorted: "No-one's talking to you. Your team is chatting. I'm too old for these mind games."

The American settled the better to claim a 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 victory in Beijing.

Gauff said: "I knew she said something to my team, but I didn't know exactly what. They told me she said, 'Shut up'. I didn't hear it, so I can only go based off what they said.

"I was telling her to be respectful. I've been nice with her team off court. We've been nice with each other. I just didn't like that comment towards my team. We moved on after that.

"I haven't spoken to her since. She's entitled to how she felt and I'm entitled to how I respond.

"I obviously have a lot of respect for Belinda. She's a great player, coming back and playing great tennis as a mom. I obviously wish today didn't happen, but it is what it is."

Gauff also backed up Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek after she said on Monday that the tennis season is too long.

"I think I've basically played as much tennis as I possibly can," Gauff said.

"It's just impossible. Especially now with more and more events being two weeks long, it just doesn't really make sense to strain your body."

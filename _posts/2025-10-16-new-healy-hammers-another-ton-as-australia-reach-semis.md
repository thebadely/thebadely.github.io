Scorecard. Table

Captain Alyssa Healy struck her second consecutive century as Australia thrashed Bangladesh by 10 wickets to secure their place in the World Cup semi-finals.

Healy scored 113 in an unbroken opening partnership of 202 with Phoebe Litchfield as the defending champions raced to their target inside 25 overs in Visakhapatnam.

Litchfield scored 84 from 72 balls, while Healy's innings came from 77 deliveries as she followed up her superb 142 in Australia's record chase against India on this ground on Sunday.

Chasing 199, the pair struck 33 boundaries between them, as Australia qualified for the knockout stages with two games to spare.

Having chosen to bat, Bangladesh opener Rubya Haider lived a charmed life, surviving numerous edges and drops before finally falling for 44.

She was the second wicket to fall as Bangladesh slid from 73-1 to 165-9.

Sobhana Mostary hit an unbeaten 66 to drag her side towards respectability, putting on a 34-run last wicket partnership with Fariha Trisna, but Bangladesh's total of 198-9 was never going to be defendable against a formidable Australia batting line-up.

Captain Healy hits century as Australia demolish Bangladesh

Australia may be unbeaten but did not start this tournament in the smoothest fashion, with individual performances digging their batting line-up out of trouble in their opening matches.

They slipped to 128-5 in their first game against New Zealand before Ash Gardner scored 115 from number six to drag them to a total their opponents couldn't chase.

Rain saw their encounter with Sri Lanka washed out without a ball bowled, before Beth Mooney took the saviour role against Pakistan, smashing 109 to take Australia from 76-7 to 221-9.

When India scored 330 on Sunday, the seven-time world champions were up against it again - only for Healy to anchor a record chase, with three other batters recording scores over 40 as Australia slotted into their familiar position as a dominant force.

Their bowlers have looked strong throughout the competition and they overpowered Bangladesh's batters in this match, with Alana King's 2-18 the pick as four of the attack took a pair of wickets.

Healy then stepped up, scoring consecutive centuries for the second time in World Cups after achieving the feat against England and the West Indies in 2022.

The 35-year-old, who may be playing her final year of international cricket, has taken her side into yet another tournament semi-final, and will be keen to continue building momentum in their final group stage games.

Their next opponents? England on Wednesday.

Australia captain Alyssa Healy: "Bangladesh have proven that they are hard to remove at times. I was a little bit poor behind the stumps but we take the two points and move on.

"It is so hard to juggle everything sometimes but I deal with it as I go. I really enjoy the challenge of it. We go to a different venue after this and we will be up for England next."

Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana Joty: "We started well and we didn't lose a wicket in the powerplay. After that, we kept losing wickets and could not build a partnership.

"In these conditions, we should have got more runs. It cost us not batting as a unit today and that cost us the game. It was a bad day for the bowlers and a rough one. We are better than this."

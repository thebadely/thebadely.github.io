According to new developments, Euro 2025 will bring a summer of fierce competition and fantastic football. 

Sixteen teams are set to play across eight venues in Switzerland from 2 to 27 July. In the group stages, defending champions England take on Wales - who are playing in their first international tournament.

Tickets are still available for a range of matches and there's a host of activities outside the games - including fan zones in Switzerland and the UK.

Whether you fancy a last-minute trip or want to watch the games at home, here's a complete guide to all the action.

Yes, but secure your spot quickly.

Tickets for high-demand matches go on sale daily at 10:00 BST via UEFA's ticketing site, with a limit of 10 tickets per person per game. Prices start at 25 CHF (about £22) and go up to 90 CHF (about £81) for the final.

You can access your tickets via the UEFA Mobile Tickets app, which can be downloaded for free by Android and iPhone users. There's also a resale platform where fans can safely resell any tickets purchased - but it's best not to rely on this for the big games.

The tournament will take place across eight Swiss cities: Basel, Bern, Geneva, Zurich, St Gallen, Lucerne, Sion, and Thun. The action kicks off in Thun on Wednesday 2 July at 17:00 BST. Expect a breathtaking backdrop of idyllic lakes and mountains. 

England matches in the group stages will be held across two cities - Zurich and St Gallen. The Lionesses take on France in Zurich on Saturday 5 July and the Netherlands in Zurich on Wednesday 9 July.

Then we're off to St Gallen for the crunch England v Wales match on Sunday 13 July.

Wales' first game will be in Lucerne against the Netherlands on Saturday 5 July, followed by their second game against France in St Gallen on Wednesday 9 July.

Flights from London to Zurich start at around £50 to £70 for one person on a one-way ticket on 2 July. Tickets get more expensive over the weekend rising to about £150 plus for a direct one-way flight. From Manchester prices for the most direct flights on 5 July start at about £200. For Cardiff, the cost is even higher.

Zurich is the best destination for England and Wales fans heading to the games, because Lucerne and St Gallen are a short train ride away. There's also the option of going to Bern or Geneva and travelling on from there.

In the car, it's about an 11-hour drive from London to Zurich. The car ferry from Dover to Calais for two people starts at about £85 on 2 July and £100 on 5 July for a one-way trip. If you take the Eurotunnel from Folkestone to Calais, prices range from about £140 to £270 on 2 and 5 July.

Trains via Paris or Brussels cost about £310 to £530 and take between seven-and-a-half and 10 hours. Coaches are cheaper, with some routes starting at about £70. But the journey takes more than 20 hours.

A very long bike ride from London to Zurich takes about 52 to 60 hours. It costs about £23 to £30 to take your bike on the ferry, not counting the toll it will take on your legs.

British citizens can travel to Switzerland without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period if the visit is for tourism and sporting events. But double check that the expiry date on your passport is dated at least three months after the day you plan to leave.

Switzerland is known for being a pricey holiday pick. But there's a range of accommodation options for different budgets.

As one of the tournament's main hubs, Zurich is in high demand. Hotel prices start around £210 to £300 per night for two people on key match nights like Saturday 5 July. If you're on a tighter budget, Airbnb prices start from £70 to £200 per night although lots of options involve staying in a room rather than renting a whole flat.

In St Gallen, hotels for Sunday 13 July range from about £200 to £600. Lots of places are already booked up. The town also offers a variety of Airbnb accommodation, with prices ranging from £50 to £800 for the same dates. Accommodation is still available slightly outside the town, so it's worth checking these spots too.

If hotels and Airbnbs stretch your budget, camping is one alternative. Campsites near Zurich and St Gallen offer scenic views and you could look into renting a car or bike to get around. The average cost for an overnight stay at a Swiss campsite is about £20 - £35, though prices vary between locations. 

Switzerland has good public transport networks, with fast and reliable services between major cities. On match days, public transport is free for ticket holders. Every ticket will be valid on the match day for a second-class round trip between any Swiss locality and the stadium. 

Switzerland's vast network of trains offer an efficient and scenic way to travel. The SBB (Swiss Federal Railways) has a range of different tickets on their website. There's also Postbus, a bus service connecting rural areas to urban centres, which offers hundreds of journeys via several apps or you can purchase tickets from stations and drivers.  

If you're planning on staying for a longer break, a Swiss Travel Pass offers unlimited travel by train, bus and boat, and is available for three, four, six, eight or 15 consecutive days.

If you're feeling more adventurous, there are also plenty of iconic cycle routes across Switzerland.

There will be city centre fan zones across the eight cities where Euro 2025 games are taking place. Organisers have planned a "packed schedule of activities for all ages" with live screenings of matches, concerts, workshops and child-friendly football pitches.

In Zurich, the ZüriFanzone will be right by the main station – with screenings of all the matches, concerts, and workshops. In St Gallen, Marktgasse in the old town will host the fan zone with lunchtime panel talks, street football and live music. In Lucerne, the fan zone is located at Europaplatz next to Lake Lucerne and will offer a range of music, concerts and football entertainment.

Fan zones open on 2 July, the day of the first game. Double check their closing dates on the UEFA event guides.

The Swiss Franc (CHF) is the official currency in Switzerland. For every pound, it's roughly 1.10 Swiss Francs. In most cases, you can also pay in Euros. A pound is worth roughly €1.17.

Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. German is the most widely spoken but English is a common second language for many Swiss people.

Switzerland is not part of the EU so mobile roaming charges could differ from rates in European countries. Check with your network provider before you travel. One solution is buying a local eSIM to cover you for the tournament.

For fans at home there are events taking place across England and Wales.

There will be watch parties of each England match in the group stages in Birmingham, London and Brighton.

In Wales, there will also be lots of watch parties and concerts, including in Swansea, Newport and Wrexham.

Look out for events on social media in your local area as the tournament goes on.

Every match in the UK will be shown either on BBC or ITV, with the final available on both channels.

There will be live coverage of 16 matches on BBC One, BBC Two and iPlayer with Gabby Logan, Alex Scott and Jeanette Kwakye presenting across the tournament. This includes Wales v Netherlands and England v Netherlands on BBC One. France v England, France v Wales and England v Wales will be on ITV.

On Radio, there will be 25 live match commentaries on Radio 5 Live, Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds across the tournament. BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru are covering Wales' games, providing commentary in English and Welsh.

The BBC Sport website, app and social media will cover every moment with live match reports, clips, highlights, interviews and analysis.

And there are lots of podcasts to help you get your football fix including Football Daily, featuring interviews with players and managers, and Feast of Football, bringing you all the latest news from Euro 2025.

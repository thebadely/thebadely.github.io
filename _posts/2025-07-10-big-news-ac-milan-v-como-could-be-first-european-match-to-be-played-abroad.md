It has been recently reported that AC Milan beat Como 2-1 in their most recent Serie A fixture in March

AC Milan's Serie A match against Como in February could become the first European league fixture to be played abroad after plans to host the fixture in Australia were announced. 

Italy's football federation (FIGC) revealed plans on Thursday to play the match in Perth. 

However, the fixture would need the approval from Fifa, Uefa, Football Australia and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

The FIGC said it has given a "positive opinion" to the Serie A plan, adding: "This brings closer what would be a historic 'trip' abroad for a Serie A match."

But it also acknowledged that the plan would involve a "complex authorisation procedure" to gain approval from the other bodies.

Fifa's rules do not allow domestic league matches to be played abroad but last year it set up a working group to look into the matter.

Last year, La Liga said it wanted to hold Barcelona v Atletico Madrid in Miami before dropping the idea because of time constraints.

In 2019, Barcelona also planned to stage a league match against Girona in Miami, but the idea was scrapped after opposition from Spain's football association and its players' union.

The Premier League has previously said it has no plans to play games overseas.

Let's dive into the details: A woman has been charged after the attempted abduction of a baby near Blackpool promenade.

Members of the public and the baby's parent intervened when the woman tried to walk away with the pram with the baby inside at about midday on Saturday, Lancashire police said. 

Nicolette Goldrick, from Marton Drive , has been charged with child abduction and police assault.

The 51-year-old has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Lancaster Magistrates Court on Monday.

Ch Insp John Jennings-Wharton said the attempted abduction was being "treated as an isolated incident" and police are not looking for anybody else in relation to the incident which happened near Coral Island.

"I know this incident has understandably caused the community a great deal of concern and I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank people for their patience and allowing us to fully investigate this matter," he added.

Let's dive into the details: Different allegations from the latest release of files by the US Department of Justice relating to Jeffrey Epstein are reported across the front pages.

The Daily Mail and the Times highlight emails between Epstein and a man believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor inviting the disgraced financier to visit Buckingham Palace after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor. The latest batch of documents shows emails signed "A", with a signature that appears to read "HRH Duke of York KG".

The Daily Telegraph and the Sun give details of the claim that the sex offender offered to set up a meeting between the man behind "The Duke" account and a 26-year-old Russian woman. 

The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing and the BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response. He has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing connected to Epstein.

The Guardian focuses on Epstein sending money to Lord Mandelson's husband, while the Daily Star hones in on lurid claims concerning the tech billionaire Bill Gates, which he has strongly denied. The Daily Mirror leads with claims relating to US President Donald Trump that the Department of Justice has described as unfounded and false.

FT Weekend says Trump's choice to take over as the chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, has buoyed confidence in the dollar. The paper says he is well regarded on Wall Street.

"I lied to protect my mates," is the Daily Express headline as it says England's white-ball cricket captain, Harry Brook, has admitted that he wasn't alone during an altercation with a night club bouncer in New Zealand last November. The Daily Telegraph says Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue could also now be under investigation by the cricket regulator. The Times says the development raises questions over whether Brook can remain captain.

The much-hyped documentary about Melania Trump - produced by Melania Trump - wasn't shown to reviewers before its release, so this morning's papers give critics their first chance to talk about the film itself.

"More outfit changes than the Devil Wears Prada, but we're no nearer unravelling the mystery that's Melania Trump," is the view of the Daily Mail. The movie isn't "so bad it's good... it's just boring," concludes the Times. The Daily Telegraph describes it as "Melania's North Korean-style propaganda, served ice-cool with a dash of Ralph Lauren." "Two hours of Melania feels like pure, endless hell," is how the Guardian ends its zero-star review.

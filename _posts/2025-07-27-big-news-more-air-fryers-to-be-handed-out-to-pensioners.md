It has been recently reported that A council is to hand out more air fryers to pensioners to help them reduce their household bills.

Last winter North Lincolnshire Council distributed 8,000 appliances, including 6,000 energy-saving cooking devices.

A Freedom of Information request by a member of the public revealed the council spent more than £650,000 on the scheme.

It was paid for from a £2.3m grant from the government's Household Support Fund.

According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, details of this year's scheme were discussed at a council meeting.

Council leader Rob Waltham said the project had "proved hugely popular". 

"We know many pensioners continue to struggle with the cost of living crisis," he said 

"Being able to support all older residents to eat healthily and keep energy bills down is important, we know it matters."

As well as air fryers people can also apply for slow-cookers and one-cup kettles.

Those eligible can register online or through their local community centre and the devices will be distributed from September onwards.

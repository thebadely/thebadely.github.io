According to new developments, Australia captain Pat Cummins (left) will play for the first time in this Ashes series

Australia have opted against recalling batter Usman Khawaja for the vital third Ashes Test â a match Ben Stokes has called the most important game in his time as England captain.

England, 2-0 down after defeats in the first two Tests, must win in Adelaide to keep their hopes of regaining the urn alive.

Defeat would mean a fourth successive series loss in Australia, extend England's run without winning the Ashes to at least 12 years and heap significant pressure on the tourists' management.

The positions of Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and managing director Rob Key would all come under significant scrutiny.

"Throughout my career I've been involved in quite a few big moments. This is another one and I'm really, really looking forward to it," Stokes told BBC Sport.

"I've enjoyed the build-up, I've enjoyed the pressure of what this game means. As it's come closer and closer, it's become a lot easier. That's how I deal with big things and big moments â look at it front on, take it on and deal with all the emotions that come with it.

"What else are you supposed to do? Don't let the moment overcome me or feel like it's going to control me. I'll go out, put all that stuff to one side and do what I need to do in every situation I get put in, and try my absolute best."

Pat Cummins will return to lead Australia after missing the first two Tests as he recovered from a back problem.

Pace bowler Cummins and off-spinner Nathan Lyon are added to the Australia team that won the second Test in Brisbane, replacing Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett.

It means no return for opener Khawaja, who missed the Test at the Gabba because of back spasms. Khawaja turns 39 on Thursday and may have played the last match of an 85-Test career.

Travis Head and Jake Weatherald will continue as the opening partnership

Australia were 2-0 ahead in the last Ashes in the UK in 2023, only for England to fight back to draw 2-2.

Cummins said his team have learned a "few lessons" from that experience and was also adamant he is fit enough to bowl without restrictions in Adelaide.

The 32-year-old has not played since the tour of West Indies in July after scans detected the back issue.

Match fitness could be crucial in the high temperatures that are forecast for when the match starts on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday).

"I had 16 weeks completely off bowling, made sure the bone heals well and from there it's ramping up," said Cummins.

"Normally you ramp up over maybe three or four months, but that would have meant missing the Ashes.

"We set on a pretty aggressive plan to get up in six or seven weeks. I haven't had any hiccups. I'm feeling great, probably better than I would have thought. The back has healed well, so, here we are."

Australia XI for third Ashes Test: Travis Head, Jake Weatherald, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.

England XI: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue.

Barking out orders: Stokes wants England to 'show a bit of dog'

In the aftermath of the defeat in the second Test in Brisbane, Stokes said his dressing room is "no place for weak men".

England have spent part of the time since that loss on holiday in Noosa, then had three days of training in Adelaide.

The tourists have made one change to their side, with Josh Tongue coming in for fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson. Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir has again been overlooked in favour of all-rounder Will Jacks.

All-rounder Stokes took over as captain in 2022 and his partnership with McCullum yielded 10 wins in their first 11 matches in charge.

After those first 11 games, England have won 16 and lost 15 of their next 33. They have not won any of their five-Test series against Australia or India.

Since pace bowler Mark Wood was ruled out of the series with a knee problem, Stokes remains as one of only four members of the England squad to have been part of a previous Ashes tour.

The 34-year-old has suggested that some of the newcomers to Australia had struggled with the atmosphere of the series.

"I've got an understanding that quite a few guys in the dressing room won't have that to fall back on," said Stokes. "What I feel like I've had to do is fall back on my own experiences, and voice that to the group."

Defeats in Ashes tours often bring sweeping changes to England teams. A loss in Adelaide would not only heap pressure onto Stokes, McCullum and Key, but also raise questions about the international futures of a number of players.

"I've probably used my voice more than I have at any time in the past three and a half years," said Stokes.

"We are in a situation where we know we need to win three games. There are a few things I felt the group needed to hear, but also a few things I felt like I needed to say to be able to go out there with a very clear head about this week.

"I've definitely left no stone unturned in terms of the mental side of the game, and what we're going into.

"Expectations around what we want to see this week â I've spoken a lot about fight, determination and grit over the last couple of days. I hope we're going to see a completely different thing, purely because of the situation we find ourselves in here."

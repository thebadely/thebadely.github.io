According to new developments, A family which shopped for school uniforms in the sales and at charity shops said there was "less of a stigma" around second-hand clothes and equipment than in the past, but items had still set them back nearly £800.

Mum, Nikki, from Guernsey, said the cost of living and specific school uniform requirements for children, James, 10, Henry, 11, Grace, 14, and Olivia, 16, had meant they felt the financial pinch this year.

The States said 1,027 children would get a grant to fund uniform this year and it had received an additional 667 applications for the money as of Monday.

It said it expected more applications later in the year, as the uniform grant scheme was open until April. 

Principal of Les Varendes High School, Verona Tomlin, said they had a uniform store which ensured students and parents always had access to school uniform

"We'll have those discreet conversations with individuals just to say 'if you need five shirts, come and take them'."

The government said each States secondary school had a uniform store and offered school supplies and equipment to pupils who needed them.

Nikki said "We tried to shop in the sales and went to charity shops" but some of the costs were unavoidable.

"The school policy is very clear about what kind of socks they have to wear, if they're wearing shorts or a skirt they have to wear white socks and if they're wearing trousers they have to wear black socks."

She said she was not "sure what colour socks they wear adhere to how well they learn".

Ms Tomlin said a uniform shows "we belong to this team".

"We want children to feel that they belong here. Uniform for me isn't about the learning as such, it's about the belonging."

Nikki said her and her husband had saved their August pay to cover the cost of going back to school. 

She said there was "less of a stigma" around second-hand clothes and equipment, and she happily accepted hand-me-downs from friends and family. 

"For a lot of people it's the only way they can manage."

In Jersey, parent Clive said: "As they get to secondary school it gets a bit more expensive – they need to buy pencils and pens and stuff like that.

"I think second-hand uniforms is a great idea, we always look for that sort of stuff, try it on before they go back to school, and then pass them down to the younger siblings."

Freya, 17, said: "I had to get a folder, a new notebook and some pencils.

"It's quite good because I already had most of it from last year that I could reuse, but there are always some bits you have to buy every year which is quite annoying."

Jade Gallichan, manager of stationery company, Paperclix, said: "When you've got so much to consider – uniforms, stationery – it adds up very quickly."

The Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority estimated that parents spent between £100 and £200 per year on uniforms.

Claire Mackenzie, manager of Jersey Hospice Shop East, said their pop-up sales of new uniforms at reduced prices had been hugely popular.

"Buying from us you'd probably pay somewhere between £15 and £20 to get a full uniform."

She added it was "a massive saving".

Carl Walker, chair of the Jersey Consumer Council, said: "It could cost up to £400 per child to prepare them for school – not just uniforms, but stationery, lunch boxes, haircuts, coats, everything. It's absolutely extortionate."

Barber Lino Cadel said he had been "back-to-back" with appointments in the run-up to term time.

"Parents are already worried, but at £15 to £17 for a standard trim, it's not too dear compared to other costs."

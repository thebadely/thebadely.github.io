Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Times and the Guardian both feature an image of smoke billowing from a building in Gaza after an Israeli attack on their front pages. The Guardian says the conflict has "become an almost daily slaughter", with 85 people reportedly killed on Sunday while seeking food. "End this horror now", is the message from Foreign Secretary David Lammy in the Daily Mirror, who describes the Israeli aid system as "inhumane".

Much is made of Reform UK's news conference on its policing and justice policies. The Daily Mail leads on Nigel Farage's claim that Britain is on the brink of "societal collapse". The Daily Express focuses on his comments that those who commit more than three serious offences could face life in prison. But as the Times points out, Farage "enjoys the freedom to promise the earth without, yet, having to deliver".

The Daily Telegraph reports that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is pushing for councils to be given powers to tax tourists. Rayner is said to want local authorities to be able to "cash in" on hotel stays. Treasury officials are apparently opposed to the plan, fearing it would harm hospitality businesses that are already "reeling" from tax increases and the pandemic.

The Daily Mirror calls the proposal to scrap the water regulator Ofwat a "welcome" move. But the Daily Express warns that while there are "merits" to this approach, it says it is unlikely a single regulator incorporating other agencies will perform any better.

"Come on England", is the message on the front of Metro, ahead of the Lionesses' Euros semi final against Italy. The i says the team are "ready to roar", with the captain, Leah Williamson, available to play despite going off with an injury in the quarter finals. According to the Guardian, the travelling supporters "smell a date with history". To get in the mood? The Daily Star is offering its readers a cut out and keep ponytail.

Experts revealed that Ronan Keating has said he hopes his New Year's Eve concert, shown on BBC One either side of the midnight fireworks, will help those who are finding things difficult. 

"It can be a very lonely time for a lot of people. A very hard time," he told BBC News during rehearsals at London's Riverside Studios. "Especially when you reflect on a tough year.

"So you want to look at, maybe, optimism into 2026," said the Boyzone singer, explaining his aims for the show.

"I hope that I can bring some sort of joy to people, so they feel like they're not at home alone tonight, that I'm right there with them."

As one of his best known solo songs puts it, Ronan Keating wants to end 2025 by putting a "smile on your face".

Last year it was Sophie Ellis-Bextor who performed in BBC One's New Year's Eve slot, describing the event as a "career highlight".

Robbie Williams, Alicia Keys and Madness have also had the honour since the tradition began in 2013, with the show often attracting the biggest TV audience for any music programme broadcast that year.

"How does this happen?" Keating asks, turning his head to look round the studio. "I feel truly honoured. The people who have gone before me. Ridiculous. And here I am, little old me. Be careful what you wish for."

He says this while standing in front of a giant R-O-N-A-N, made up of Elvis '68 Comeback-style golden lights. 

"My head is swelling constantly," he jokes.

It turns out, he has been wondering where the display will end up after the concert.

"In my bedroom?" he suggests mischievously. "That would be amazing."

These annual New Year's Eve shows have become renowned for their guest appearances. 

Olly Alexander's team sheet included Kylie Minogue and Pet Shop Boys, Sam Ryder was joined by Justin Hawkins from The Darkness, while Rick Astley duetted with Rylan. 

Keating has enlisted the help of an old flatmate, Louise, with whom he shared digs during the early days of her group Eternal.

"Lou and I and Shano [his nickname for Boyzone's Shane Lynch], we were flatmates back in 1995, right next door to Ant & Dec in London," he reminisces.  

"It was a poptastic house. We were on the Smash Hits Roadshows. We'd all be touring together and coming back to our flat. It was very cute."

So who took longer in the bathroom, him or Louise? 

"Shano," he answers without missing a beat. "Plucking his eyebrow!"

Another special guest is the former EastEnders star and finalist in this year's I'm A Celebrity, Shona McGarty. 

"What a voice," enthuses Keating. 

"She was singing every night on the show and I just thought, man, we've got to get her on New Year's Eve. That was her audition."

Tonight, there  will be no rendition of her campsite creation Feeling Good in the Jungle. Instead she will be duetting on the Tracy Chapman song that Boyzone took to number two in the charts, Baby Can I Hold You. 

Calum Scott, whose album Bridges is a favourite in the Keating household ("I love his voice. I love his songwriting") will sing the late Stephen Gately's part on No Matter What.

Exactly 30 years ago this week, Boyzone's version of Father and Son was prevented from reaching number one by Michael Jackson's Earth Song.

Two members of the group, Keith Duffy and Shane Lynch, will be seen tonight, giving a taste of what can be expected when Boyzone reunite in 2026, for two huge shows in June at London's Emirates stadium. 

"It's unbelievable," beams Keating.

"Boyzone never headlined a stadium before.

"The guest list is ridiculous. The phone hasn't stopped ringing. And yes, I have received more Christmas cards this year than I normally do," he chortles.

One thing Keating will not be doing is making any New Year's resolutions. 

"If I've got to make changes, I make them now. I won't wait till a certain date, because I'll only fail." 

He pauses, suddenly looking more wistful. 

"Really for me it's about spending more time with loved ones; family and friends. It's been a tough couple of years. We lost my brother," he explains.

In July 2023, his elder brother Ciaran was killed in a car crash at the age of 57, while travelling to watch his son Ruairí play for Cork City Football Club.

"Now, keeping the family together is more important than ever for me," he emphasises.

It suddenly becomes clear that Keating was also talking about himself when explaining how difficult people can find new year. 

Tonight he too will use music as part of his own healing process, by singing the soundtrack to his more than 30-year career, a period over which he has made the journey from Boyzone to family man.

Ronan and Friends: A New Year's Eve Party is on BBC One and iPlayer from 23:30 except in Scotland where the Hogmanay show will feature music from sea shanty singer Nathan Evans, Michelle McManus and the award-winning folk supergroup Mànran.

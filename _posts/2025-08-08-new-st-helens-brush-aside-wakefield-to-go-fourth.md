St Helens brushed aside Wakefield with six tries to climb to fourth in the Super League table.

Prop Alex Walmsley waltzed in for Saints' opening try after seven minutes and it set the tone as loose forward Morgan Knowles and hooker Daryl Clark also went over to help them into a 20-4 half-time lead.

Harry Robertson added a fourth try after the break before Kyle Feldt crossed twice to complete a crushing victory.

Wakefield found little in attack and only had a first-half try from Lachlan Walmsley to show for their efforts.

It was Saints' eighth straight away win at Wakefield, who stay sixth and could slip to seventh if Hull FC beat Salford on Sunday.

The hosts thought they had scored the opening try after just five minutes but it was ruled out for an incorrect play of the ball and just two minutes later, Saints took the lead as Alex Walmsley dashed in easily.

Soon after, Wakefield got nowhere near claiming a high kick that was instead taken unopposed by Owen Dagnall for Saints who fed Knowles for a run in, before another missed high kick led to Owen Pratt sin-binned for a tackle off the ball.

A third try quickly followed as Feldt was released down the right wing and two passes inside sent Clark over on his 400th career appearance.

Then came potentially a pivotal moment as Saints interchange George Delaney was only shown a yellow card for jumping into a tackle and making clear contact with Lachlan Walmsley's head.

Walmsley shrugged it off to take Mason Lino's perfectly floated pass to dive spectacularly into the right corner but Trinity still trailed by 16 points at half-time.

The game was effectively put to bed nine minutes into the second half as Robertson caught Jayden Myers napping to touch down a grubber kick in the right corner.

Wakefield thought they had scored a second try but it was ruled out for obstruction before a loose pass went to ground and Feldt gathered to run in from halfway for Saints' fifth try.

And the finishing touch was applied a couple of minutes before full-time as Saints kept the ball alive superbly and eventually worked Feldt into the right corner.

Wakefield head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds:

"We got belted to be honest. The start probably summed it up with not playing the ball properly and the set after that they just rolled us and scored.

"I don't think the week off did us any good and we didn't come out of that well.

"Saints have been too good for us all year. They've beaten us three times and they've been deserved winners three times and we haven't handled how hard they've come at us."

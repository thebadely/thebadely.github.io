Let's dive into the details: The Princess of Wales' annual Christmas carol service is to take place for the fifth year early next month, with British movie stars Kate Winslet, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hannah Waddingham delivering readings at the event. 

The "power of love and togetherness" will be celebrated at the Together at Christmas event led by Catherine, who wants to recognise people across the country who contribute to society.

Organisers said the theme was picked because people will be able to celebrate love in all forms in a world that can often feel fragmented and disconnected.

The service -  which will be a mixture of traditional and modern elements to include people of all faiths and none - will be held in Westminster Abbey on 5 December.

Last Christmas, Catherine similarly focused on love, and the importance of giving and receiving empathy, following her cancer diagnosis earlier in the year. 

She spoke of her relief at completing her course of chemotherapy in September 2024, and revealed this year in January that she is in remission from cancer.

In 2021, she surprised guests with her piano-playing skills alongside musician Tom Walker in a clip shown at the event, which was staged for people who supported their communities during the Covid pandemic.

Guests at the event will be people who have been nominated by lord-lieutenants across the UK and charities linked to the royal family. Among them will also be guests who have been invited after having shown love and kindness this year.

As well as the readings by the British acting stars, carols will be sung by the Westminster Abbey choir, alongside musical performances.

A festive display based on the importance of nature in our lives, created by horticulturist Jamie Butterworth, will feature at the event. 

The Royal Horticultural Society is also set to donate wreaths made by their ambassadors and schoolchildren.

Across the UK, 15 community carol services on the same theme of love and togetherness will also take place, including in a community farm in Gwent and an arts centre in Newbury.

The Westminster Abbey service will air on ITV1 and ITVX on Christmas Eve and again on Christmas Day.

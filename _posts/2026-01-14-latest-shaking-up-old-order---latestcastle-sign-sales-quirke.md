According to new developments, Raffi Quirke became Sale Sharks' youngest-ever scrum-half when he made his debut against Harlequins in February 2021, aged 19

Newcastle Red Bulls have confirmed the signing of Sale Sharks scrum-half Raffi Quirke on a two-year deal for next season.

Sale announced on Tuesday that the 24-year-old would be leaving at the end of the campaign.

Both of Quirke's two England caps to date came in 2021 but he was part of the squad for last year's autumn internationals and was also at a January get-together earlier this month.

Meanwhile, Newcastle have signed North Harbour hooker Bryn Gordon on a deal until the end of the season.

The 24-year-old New Zealander, who qualifies for England, made his Super Rugby debut for Blues last season and could make his Red Bulls bow at Dragons on Friday.

Quirke is the latest player to commit to Newcastle for 2026-27 as new owners Red Bull continue to overhaul the squad..

All Black Hoskins Sotutu, Exeter pair Josh Hodge and Rusi Tuima, Northampton forward duo Sam Graham and Elliot Millar-Mills and Argentina's Franco Molina will all be arriving in the summer.

"Having been up to visit Newcastle and listen to their vision, I could only be massively excited about the new journey they are all on with Red Bull," he told the club website., external

"I want to be part of that new story, and I look forward to bringing my energy and attacking mindset to a club that deserves to be shaking up the old rugby order for the fans in the north east."

Newcastle were taken over by energy drink company Red Bull in the summer and have already started rebuilding their squad, with their arrivals for this season including Wales and British and Irish Lions full-back Liam Williams, former Wasps and Gloucester wing Christian Wade and Argentina scrum-half Simon Benitez Cruz. 

And, after a losing start to the campaign, their form has picked up in recent weeks, with the Red Bulls winning four of their past six games in all competitions.

The results have helped the club progress to the knockout stages of the European Challenge Cup and they also claimed a first win in The Prem since 2024 when they beat Gloucester 25-19 in their first league match of the new year.

Quirke becomes the first player involved with the senior England set-up to sign up to Newcastle's new era and is a significant coup for the upwardly-mobile Red Bulls.

His physicality and pace are his point of difference, making him a threat around the fringe. He has even made cameo appearances on the wing for Sale and did not look out of place out wide.

He is younger than you may have thought as well. Having made his Sale Sharks debut at 19 and England bow at 20, it feels like he has been on the scrum-half scene for a long time, but he is only 24.

He is highly thought of in the England set-up, with head coach Steve Borthwick keen to include him when available. Keeping injury-free and ahead of the impressive Simon Benitez Cruz will be the challenge for him now.

If he can manage to do so, a third England cap will not be far behind.

Newcastle's recruitment has focused heavily on adding bulk, depth and quality to their forward pack this winter.

However, Quirke's signing, along with all-court number eight Hoskins Sotutu, suggest Red Bull are, predictably enough, aiming to entertain Kingston Park with speed and swagger as well next season.

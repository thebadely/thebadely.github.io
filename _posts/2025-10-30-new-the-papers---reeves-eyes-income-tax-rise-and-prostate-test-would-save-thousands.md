The Daily Telegraph says Rachel Reeves is considering a 2p rise in income tax in next month's Budget - and that she could become the first chancellor since the 1970s to raise the basic rate. It says Reeves might opt for a scheme floated by the Resolution Foundation think tank, which offsets the increase with a cut in National Insurance. It says that would hit pensioners and landlords but would allow her to say that overall rates are not going up for working people. 

The Times also thinks that is under consideration and says the latest set of economic forecasts tomorrow could be crucial in deciding what measures are needed. The i says Sir Keir Starmer has paved the way for "manifesto-breaking income tax hikes" - in what it calls a political gamble to find cash to boost growth.

The editorial in the Sun says that deporting the Ethiopian asylum seeker who was jailed for sexual assault, then released in error, is "hardly a victory" and is more of a farce. It says the asylum system is beyond broken, and urges ministers to rip it up and start again. 

The Daily Mail groups the incident with two other murder cases in the headlines yesterday, saying the consequences of Britain's porous borders have been laid bare by "blood-curdling tragedies and moronic bureaucracy". The Daily Express concludes that if Labour can't fix the problem, the UK needs a government that will.

The Guardian says five women involved in the inquiry into grooming gangs are demanding an apology from Nigel Farage for saying they were victims of other forms of abuse. The five, who publicly backed Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, said his comments were untrue and degrading. The paper says Reform UK has been approached for comment.

The Times reports that a European trial has offered "compelling new evidence" in favour of a screening programme for prostate cancer. It says it found screening all men over 50 would save thousands of lives in Britain. The Telegraph, which also highlights the study, says it wants a targeted scheme which offers tests first to those most at risk, such as black men or those with a family history of the disease.

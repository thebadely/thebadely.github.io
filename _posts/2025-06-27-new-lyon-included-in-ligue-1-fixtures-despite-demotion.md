It has been recently reported that Lyon have won the Ligue 1 title on seven occasions

Lyon have been included in the Ligue 1 fixtures for next season despite being relegated to French football's second tier because of the poor state of their finances.

In the schedule released on Friday, Lyon have been earmarked to play Lens in their opening game of the 2025-26 campaign - which starts on the weekend of 16-17 August.

Lyon were provisionally demoted in November by the DNGC, the body which oversees the accounts of French professional football clubs.

Club officials, including owner John Textor, met with the DNGC earlier this week but failed to convince the body that the club had improved their financial situation enough to lift the punishment.

Last October Textor's Eagle Football Group, which owns a 77% stake in Lyon, announced debts of Â£422m.

Lyon previously described the DNGC's decision as "incomprehensible" and have taken steps to appeal.

Les Gones finished sixth in Ligue 1 last season and qualified for the Europa League. 

Their relegation could prove significant to FA Cup winners Crystal Palace, whose hopes of playing in the Europa League next season are under threat because of Uefa rules which prevent multiple teams under one multi-club ownership structure competing in the same European competition.

Textor owns stakes in both clubs although he agreed a deal to sell his 43% share in Palace on Monday.

Uefa executives met on Friday to discuss the matter, and the outcome of the hearing had been expected to be announced later in the day, but the meeting is now set to resume at the start of next week.

Experts revealed that Granit Xhaka has one goal and three assists for Sunderland

Former Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney says Sunderland captain Granit Xhaka is "probably the signing of the season".

The Black Cats have been superb on their return to the Premier League and currently sit fourth after 11 games with 19 points, putting them well on the way to securing their primary objective of staying up this season.

Former Arsenal midfielder Xhaka has been a key factor in Sunderland's strong start thanks to his experience and leadership skills.

He has played every minute of all their league games, scoring once and providing three assists.

This season he leads the way for the Sunderland in terms of assists, chances created, touches, successful passes, duels won, possession won and distance covered.

The 33-year-old was one of several summer signings following promotion from the Championship, joining from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial Â£13m.

Rooney said on The Wayne Rooney Show: "Coming back to the Premier League you wonder if he can do it. Obviously with a promoted team as well coming up, what impact could he have? 

"But he's probably been the signing of the season. He has been brilliant."

Xhaka made 297 appearances for Arsenal, winning two FA Cups. 

But he was something of a pantomime villain - and sometimes much-maligned - at the Gunners.

He was sent off five times for Arsenal and spent six weeks as captain in 2019, clashed with his own fans and was stripped of the armband.

But things went better under Mikel Arteta and he became an important player before leaving in 2023 for Leverkusen, where he helped them to their first Bundesliga title during his opening season.

"When he had the situation with Arsenal, when he fell out with the fans it showed his character to go and play for Arsenal again," Rooney added.

"To get through that and then go and perform for Arsenal, and then at Leverkusen to be part of a team to beat Bayern Munich to the title for the first time in over 10 years has shown what a good player he is.

"Sunderland have got a very young squad as well. He'd almost be like a father figure and he'll be a big help for the coach as well to be the in-between man as captain.

"And they made a lot of signings in the summer, he'll be a massive help for the manager and with them players, for sure, using his experience."

Let's dive into the details: Murray won five Six Nations titles during his Ireland career 

Former Ireland and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Conor Murray has confirmed his retirement from rugby after opting against a move abroad.

Murray, 36, ended his Test career alongside Peter O'Mahony and Cian Healy at the conclusion of this year's Six Nations. 

While initially indicating that he would "pursue a playing opportunity abroad", five-time Six Nations winner Murray has decided to hang up his boots. 

"I had left it open-ended," he told The 42, external.

"My body felt really good and in a good place. But it was more for a life experience for my wife Joanna and our little boy Alfie, who's 10 months now, and just if we wanted to go somewhere nice and experience a nice place to live, for them as much as me wanting to play on."

Murray added that he received a "couple of offers" to extend his career.

"There was one in Japan but dragging them [his family] there, putting them in an apartment in Tokyo or something like that just didn't appeal to where we're at at the minute," he added.

"So long story short, nothing of appeal came up and I'm very happy to hang up the boots properly and move into the next chapter."

During his 125-cap Ireland career, Murray won five Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams.

He also made eight Test appearances for the British and Irish Lions across the 2013, 2017 and 2021 tours. 

Having made his debut in 2010, Murray played 206 times for Munster, winning two United Rugby Championship titles.

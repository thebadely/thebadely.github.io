It has been recently reported that Last Friday, Israel launched massive air strikes on Iran, prompting Tehran to retaliate with barrages of missiles. 

In a video message that day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Iranian people that in addition to Israel's aim of thwarting Iran's nuclear programme, "we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom".

Some sections of Iran's splintered opposition have rallied behind Netanyahu's call. Others are mistrustful of his objective.

There are no official opposition groups inside Iran, where authorities have long cracked down on dissent, including a wave of mass executions and imprisonments in the 1980s. 

Since then, most opposition groups have operated from abroad, including two of the most organised groups: the pro-monarchy supporters of Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, and the exiled Mojahedin-e Khalq Organisation (MEK/MKO).

It has become increasingly difficult for journalists to contact people inside Iran, due to the authorities restricting access to the internet and social media.

We have managed to speak to several young Iranians who oppose the regime - and have protested against it in the past - in recent days, however. 

Their names have been changed for their safety as the Iranian authorities frequently imprison opponents in an attempt to suppress dissent.

Tara, 26, told the BBC that when Israel issues evacuation warnings ahead of strikes, authorities shut off internet access "so that people don't find out and the death toll rises".

Checkpoints and toll stations are also set up, she says, accusing authorities of "deliberately" creating traffic, which "encourages people to stay in targeted areas".

"Talking about patriotism, unity, and standing up to the enemy is absurd. The enemy has been killing us slowly for decades. The enemy is the Islamic Republic!"

The Israeli military has been issuing evacuation warnings via Telegram and X, which are banned in Iran. Coupled with limited internet access, this means it's difficult for Iranians to see the warnings. 

Sima, 27, tells us she does not care about this anymore.

"I wish Israel would get the job done as soon as possible. I'm exhausted. Although I'm still not a fan of Israel or what it's doing, I hope they'd finish what they've started. 

"Wishful thinking, I know. But I want them to rid us and the world of the threat of the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei and ayatollahs as a whole."

Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, including the powerful IRGC, which is tasked with defending the Islamic system and overseeing Iran's ballistic missiles. The recent Israeli strikes have killed many senior IRGC figures, including its commander, Hossein Salami.

Some people we spoke to were even more forceful in their support for Israel's attacks.

Amir, 23, said he supported them "100%". Asked why, he said he believed no-one else was prepared to take on the regime.

"Not the UN, not Europe, not even us. We tried, remember? And they killed us in the streets. I'm joyful when the people who've crushed our lives finally taste fear. We deserve that much."

Amir is referencing the widespread protests in Iran following the death of Masha Amini. The 22-year-old died in police custody in 2022 after being arrested for allegedly violating rules requiring women to wear the headscarf.

The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group reported that 537 protesters were killed by state security forces during the unrest. The government's official line is that "security forces acted with responsibility", blaming the deaths on violent protesters or foreign agitators.

The rallying cry of the protests - "woman, life, freedom" - was repeated by Netanyahu on Friday in both English and Persian, as he urged Iranians to "stand up and let your voices be heard".

Iran has not officially responded to the Israeli prime minister's calls, but some hardliners and media figures have mocked and dismissed the remarks. Meanwhile, authorities have warned against sharing campaigns and statements by Israeli and US officials.

Some opponents of the Islamic Republic are suspicious of Netanyahu's intentions, however.

"I participated in the protests [in 2022] because I had hope for a regime change then. I just don't see how the regime could be overthrown in this conflict without Iran itself being destroyed in the process," said Navid, a 25-year-old activist who was briefly arrested during the protests.

"Israel is killing ordinary people as well. At some point, people will start to take the side of the Islamic Republic," he added.

Darya, 26, said: "I think the fact that people are not coming out to protest is already a clear response" to Netanyahu's call.

"I wouldn't go even if Israel bombed my house. Netanyahu is hiding behind Iranian nationalist slogans and pretends he's helping Iranians reach freedom while he's targeted residential areas. It's going to take years just to rebuild the country."

Arezou, 22, said she did not know what to think.

"I hate the regime, and I hate what it's done to us. But when I see bombs falling, I think of my grandmother, my little cousin. And I've seen what Netanyahu did to Gaza - do you really think he cares about Iranians? This isn't about us, it's about [Israeli] politics," she said.

"I feel like I have to choose between two evils, and I can't. I just want my people safe. I want to breathe without fear."

Mina, 27, said: "I want this regime gone more than anything - but not like this. Not through more bombs, more death."

"Israel is not our saviour. When innocent people die, it's not a step toward freedom, it's another form of injustice. I don't want to trade one kind of terror for another. I'm against this regime and also against this war. We deserve a better way out than this."

It has been recently reported that Ryan Brierley made 95 appearances for Salford Red Devils between 2022 and 2025 before joining Oldham in August

Former captain Ryan Brierley is returning to Salford to become chief executive, the consortium that has won the bid to run the phoenix club has said.

Brierley, one of the players who departed the club midway through the 2025 campaign, has ended his playing career at Oldham in order to take on the role.

He has been appointed two days after fellow former Salford player Mason Caton-Brown's consortium was successful in applying for membership of the second-tier Championship from the Rugby Football League.

The old Salford Red Devils club were wound up on 3 December after a turbulent year, with a mass player exodus, late wage payments, heavy defeats and ultimately the loss of their Super League status for 2026.

"Salford is in my heart, and I believe saving its rugby league heritage is something that transcends rivalry," 33-year-old Brierley said.

"I hope Oldham's incredible supporters understand that this is about protecting something we all care deeply about, and what a great club they belong to."

In a statement,, external Oldham said they wished Brierley "every success in his new venture, and we thank him for his efforts in an Oldham shirt".

Coincidentally, Salford are set to begin the 2026 Championship season by hosting Oldham in mid-January in their first game back.

"It feels fitting," Brierley added. "That match will be about rebirth, it will be a celebration of rugby league itself.

"Two historic clubs, built by working people, standing shoulder to shoulder for the good of the game."

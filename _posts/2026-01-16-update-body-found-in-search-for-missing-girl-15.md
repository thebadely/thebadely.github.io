Experts revealed that A body has been found in the search for a missing girl, 15, who was swept into the sea off the East Yorkshire coast, Humberside Police has said.

Grace Keeling went into the water at Withernsea on 2 January. Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.

The force said emergency services had attempted to retrieve the body, which was found among the rocks on the beach at Withernsea on Thursday at 08:30 GMT, but was unsuccessful due to tide times and other conditions.

Specialist officers have been in contact with Grace Keeling's family and have asked people to "refrain from speculation" and "respect their privacy".

Police said emergency services, including HM Coastguard, had cordoned off an area of Holmpton Road and remained at the scene.

Det Supt Simon Vickers said: "Officers and specialist teams have been working to explore every possible option in very complex circumstances to delicately recover the body.

"Due to tide times, conditions and the location, the recovery could not be immediately carried out and has therefore been paused until it is safe to resume."

A major operation was launched involving HM Coastguard, lifeboats and helicopters after calls to the emergency services at about 15:00 GMT on 2 January.

Police have previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace Keeling and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was "believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave".

Ratcliffe was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. Sarah Keeling's body was recovered later the same evening.

In a tribute, Ratcliffe's family described him as a "true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others".

Joanne Gee, a close friend of Sarah Keeling, said the 45-year-old "left a mark with absolutely everyone she met".

Humberside Police said no formal identification of the body had taken place but recognised the discovery had followed 13 days of "extensive searches" for Grace Keeling.

Vickers added: "I appreciate this update will understandably cause concern to members of the public.

"We have a dedicated team of specialists who are doing everything they can in their efforts to carry out the recovery as safely and as quickly as possible."

An inquest into the deaths of Ratcliffe and Sarah Keeling was opened at Hull Coroners' Court on 12 January.

The hearing was told that the results of a preliminary post mortem examination found Sarah Keeling died from drowning and head and neck injuries.

She came from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire and worked in sales.

Ratcliffe, who was a retired warehouse worker and lived in Withernsea, died from drowning and chest injuries. He was originally from Bradford, the court heard.

The inquest was adjourned to a later date.

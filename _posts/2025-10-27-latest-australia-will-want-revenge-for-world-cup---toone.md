Ella Toone on 'revenge game' against Australia

England midfielder Ella Toone says it will "feel like a revenge game" for Australia when the sides meet in their friendly match at Pride Park on Tuesday.

The last time the two sides met England beat Australia in the 2023 Women's World Cup semi-final in Sydney.

In her media conference earlier on Monday, Australia and Arsenal defender Steph Catley admitted the defeat was the "most heartbreaking" of her career.

Toone is expecting another physical game as a result, off the back of England's 2-1 defeat by Brazil, who played with 10 players for almost 70 minutes on Saturday.

"We broke a lot of their hearts at the World Cup so it will feel like a revenge game. For us, we just want to go out there and put on a big performance," said Toone.

"It's difficult when you lose a game but there's another one right around the corner to put it right. We know it will be difficult. 

"There are no friendlies in football. We want to win every game. We want to perform well and hopefully get the win."

There are 11 players from the Australia squad who play for clubs in the Women's Super League - so Toone is familiar with many of the opponents. 

"I think it gives you more of an insight of what those players bring on the pitch. You know the strengths and weaknesses of each player," she added. 

"But I don't think it changes it too much. Yuu are stepping out on to the pitch to put 100% in no matter who it is."

England manager Sarina Wiegman said both teams have moved on since the 2023 World Cup with changes to both squads.

Former Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro is now in charge of the Matildas, while there are several uncapped players and new assistant coaches with the Lionesses.

"I didn't think about it. I'm just really excited we play Australia again. They are a top-level team and they will challenge us in the way we want to be," said Wiegman. 

"Of course, it's a non-European team but so many players play against each other here in the WSL so they know each other really well. 

"But no, I'm not really looking back at the World Cup semi-final. It was an incredible game [but] we have moved on and they have moved on."

England's defeat by Brazil kickstarted the first of four friendly matches which are forming a "homecoming series" to celebrate their Euro 2025 victory. 

Several key players are missing from the squad through injury, including captain Leah Williamson, forwards Lauren Hemp and Lauren James, and midfielders Jess Park and Grace Clinton. 

However, there could be a boost for Wiegman with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton set to return after missing Saturday's defeat with a minor elbow injury.

West Ham defender Anouk Denton has also been called up to the squad to provide extra cover as players return to full fitness and manage knocks.

Of Hampton, Wiegman said: "She's good and she's progressing really well. She has ticked all the boxes so far. There is another training session to come through but things look really good.

"We have all seen what she can bring. She is a good goalkeeper. The first task for any goalkeeper is to stop the ball going in the net, together with the team. 

"But she is also very good with her feet and that long-distance kick she has. That is really her super-strength."

England have conceded first in their last four games but Wiegman said her side have not been guilty of"starting slowly despite finding themselves behind. 

"Against Spain [in the Euros final] we started well and could have been 1-0 up. The Italy [semi-final] we could have scored one goal," she said.

"Against Sweden we didn't start well and then against France we started well. So I don't agree that we have slow starts but I do agree, that on Saturday we didn't start well enough and needed to be more physical. 

"We will definitely do everything we can to start better on Tuesday."

England's game against Australia will be in front of a sell-out crowd at Pride Park (19:00 GMT).

The attendance at Etihad Stadium against Brazil was 37,460 after the Football Association said before the match that over 43,000 tickets had been issued. For Saturday's game,  a Premier League game in the same city clashed with the kick-off time.

"I think it's really nice," Wiegman said of Tuesday's match being so well supported. 

"The fans have shown so much support for us here in England but also in Switzerland for the Euros," said Wiegman. 

"It really helps us and it's one of the reasons why we go around the country. Now it's sold-out and that's incredible. We never take that for granted. 

"It's also on a Tuesday evening. There will be great support again. We really appreciate it and enjoy it. We try to connect with our fans all the time."

According to new developments, Angela Rayner is fighting for her political future after admitting she should have paid more stamp duty when she bought a flat in Hove earlier this year. 

The deputy prime minister has denied trying to dodge the extra tax, but faces a probe into whether she broke ministerial rules. 

Here is a breakdown of how the story unfolded.

Rayner buys a house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, with her then-husband Mark, which becomes their family home.

A court orders that a trust be set up to manage a financial award made to her severely disabled son, reportedly from the NHS, linked to his premature birth.

During their divorce, the couple each decide to transfer some of their share in the family home to the trust set up for their son.

Rayner sells her remaining stake in the house to the trust, receiving a lump sum thought to be £162,500.

The deputy prime minister uses the sum, along with a mortgage, to buy a three-bedroom flat in Hove, East Sussex, for £800,000.

According to Rayner, she was advised she would only need to pay the standard rate of stamp duty on the purchase.

The Mail on Sunday and Sun on Sunday report her purchase of the Hove flat, with the Tories calling on her to clarify where she pays council tax.

The Daily Telegraph reports Rayner saved £40,000 in stamp duty by not paying the higher rate reserved for additional home purchases.

In the story, published on its website late in the evening, the newspaper quotes a spokesperson for Rayner saying she paid the "correct duty" on the purchase.

The Tories announce they have written to Sir Laurie Magnus, the prime minister's ethics adviser, asking him to investigate Rayner's tax affairs.

Rayner instructs a senior lawyer to review her tax position that evening.

Downing Street tells reporters Rayner cannot give further details of her situation due to a court order, which she is "urgently" trying to lift.

Shortly afterwards, Sir Keir Starmer rallies round Rayner during a BBC interview, saying he is "proud" of his deputy.

The senior lawyer commissioned by Rayner gives a draft opinion on her situation in the evening, whilst seeking further information.

The court order is lifted late in the evening.

The senior lawyer's final legal opinion is received in the morning, with Rayner contacting HMRC and referring herself for investigation by Sir Laurie.

Shortly before Sir Keir is due to appear at Prime Minister's Questions, Rayner releases a statement admitting she should have paid the higher rate of stamp duty when purchasing the Hove flat.

She denies she tried to dodge the extra tax, saying the initial legal advice she received failed to "properly take account" of her tax liability resulting from the nature of her son's trust.

Sir Keir again backs his deputy, but the Conservatives and Reform UK call for her to resign.

Sir Keir repeatedly refuses to say if he will sack Rayner if the standards adviser concludes she broke the ministerial code.

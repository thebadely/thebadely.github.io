Wolverhampton remain winless after loss against Sunderland

The contrast in emotions at full-time at the Stadium of Light was palpable.

Sunderland, having won their fourth game out of eight on their return to the Premier League, climbed up to seventh.

Wolves, by comparison, remain rooted to the bottom of the table and without a win so far this term. 

Regis le Bris' side have enjoyed their joint-best start to a Premier League season, while Wolves have endured their second worst. 

So, what is behind the difference in results? 

Given the turbulence at the club over the last decade, Sunderland fans could be forgiven for feeling apprehensive on their return to the Premier League. 

Their route back to the top division has been a long one, with the Black Cats experiencing back-to-back relegations and spending four years in League One. 

Even last season's promotion was dramatic.

Having finished 16th the season before, Sunderland upset the odds to beat Sheffield United in the play-off final with a last-gasp winner in injury time at Wembley. 

But there has been more than good fortune to Sunderland's revival. 

There were fears after the Black Cats made 14 first-team signings this summer that Le Bris' side could lose the togetherness that helped them earn promotion.

But the Black Cats have more than maintained the momentum so far this season.

With 14 points from eight matches, Sunderland have matched their best start to a Premier League campaign.

Not that manager Le Bris is taking anything for granted. 

"For me it's just a question of the next game," he told BBC Sport. 

"It's a long journey and a tough journey. If we can win points early, it's good for the confidence."

The Black Cats' fine start has been built on their home form, with 10 of their 14 points coming at the Stadium of Light - only leaders Arsenal have as many. 

Perhaps the most impressive element of Sunderland's form is that they have bucked the trend of promoted sides in recent times.

Southampton, Leicester and Ipswich - who were all relegated last season having earned promotion the season before - managed just 14 points between them after eight matches last season. Sunderland have already matched that total on their own. 

In fact, Sunderland's points tally is the best from a promoted since since Wolves in the 2018-19 campaign.

If 40 points is the benchmark for survival, then Sunderland are already well on their way to safety. 

Sunderland maintain fine home form as Wolves lose again

Wolves may be one point better off than at the same stage last season but there are few positives to extract from Saturday's trip to the North East.

Despite the season being only eight games old, they are already five points from safety, in danger of being cut adrift and have the worst goal difference in the division.

They have also failed to score in four of their eight games so far and it is the 14th occasion a side has had two or fewer points at this stage, with eight of the previous 13 ending up relegated.

Indeed Wolves are the only club to not be relegated from that position in the last five campaigns.

While Vitor Pereira talked up his players' performance after an insipid opening 45 minutes they still fell short against opponents that were operating in League One as recently as three years ago.

"When I look back at the first half, I don't remember good moments," said Pereira.

"In the second half we corrected our moments and in my opinion we played 30 minutes of high-quality football and created three or four chances to score.

"In the Premier League you cannot lose these moments. But in the end we concede. In the last 15 minutes with two strikers we stopped playing, we started playing the long ball and this is not our game."

While Pereira penned a new contract exactly a month ago after four straight Premier League defeats the wisdom of that could well come under scrutiny given their plight has barely improved.

The other big issue is that Jorgen Strand Larsen is yet to score a top-flight goal this term.

The Norway international has averaged a goal every 3.5 games over his career.

And it was presumed that he was viewed as key to the club steering clear of trouble this term when they rebuffed offers of Â£50m and Â£55m for him from Newcastle in the summer.

He is yet to get going although the blame can hardly be placed solely on his shoulders for Wolves looking toothless in attack.

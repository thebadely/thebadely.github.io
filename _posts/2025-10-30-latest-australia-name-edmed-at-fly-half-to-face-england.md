Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Edmed made his Test debut from the bench against Ireland last autumn

Quilter Nations Series: England v Australia

Venue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham Date: Saturday, 1 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Tane Edmed will start at fly-half for Australia when they face England at Allianz Stadium on Saturday, while Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, Max Jorgensen and Taniela Tupou are all recalled following last weekend's win over Japan.

But with the fixture falling outside the official international window, the Wallabies are still without several European-based players, including fly-half James O'Connor, lock Will Skelton and centre Len Ikitau.

Edmed has only started three Tests in his fledging Wallabies career and will face a tough test against England's vastly experienced George Ford on Saturday.

The 25-year-old's rival fly-half Carter Gordon, who has secured a release from his NRL contract to resume his rugby union career, is believed to be struggling with a quad strain and is not in the matchday 23.

Hamish Stewart will provide fly-half cover on the bench.

Former rugby league star Suaalii made an eye-catching Test debut in last season's dramatic 42-37 victory at Twickenham, pinching a high ball in the build-up to Jorgensen's winning try with the last play of the game.

In the absence of Ikitau, who has been in outstanding form for Prem side Exeter, Hunter Paisami will continue his centre partnership with Suaalii.

Tupou, the 23-stone tight-head prop nicknamed the 'Tongan Thor', last appeared for the Wallabies in their defeat by New Zealand in September.

Regular captain Harry Wilson returns to the number eight jersey, with Rob Valetini and Fraser McReight completing a powerful back row. Nick Champion de Crespigny, last week's skipper, is among the replacements.

Australia finished third in the Rugby Championship with two wins from six games and beat Japan 19-15 in Tokyo on Saturday with a much-changed team before flying to England.

The Wallabies, ranked seventh in the world, will also play Italy, Ireland and France this autumn.

"The coaches have tried to balance this year's tough schedule in terms of Test matches and travel," said head coach Joe Schmidt. 

"It was great to freshen a few players up last weekend and we hope that allows the group to be really competitive on Saturday."

Starting XV: Kellaway; Jorgensen, Suaalii, Paisami, Potter; Edmed, Gordon; Bell, Pollard, Tupuo, Frost, Williams, Valentini, McReight, Wilson (capt).

Replacements: Nasser, Robertson, Alaalatoa, Salakaia-Loto, Champion de Crespigny, Lonergan, Stewart, Daugunu.

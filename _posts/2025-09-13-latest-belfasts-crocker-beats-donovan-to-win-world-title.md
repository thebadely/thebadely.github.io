It has been recently reported that Crocker savours that winning feeling 

Lewis Crocker claimed the vacant IBF welterweight title with a split decision win against Paddy Donovan at Windsor Park.

The Belfast man scored knockdowns in rounds three and five, which proved crucial as two cards in his favour read 114-112 and 114-113, while Donovan claimed a 115-111 verdict on the third.

It was a night of vindication for Crocker in this rematch, having won the first meeting between the pair in March by disqualification despite being second best in the fight.

The Belfast man produced a much better performance this time and was much crisper, quicker and sharper with his heavy hands, although using them sparingly, proved vital as he improved to 22-0 with Donovan's record now at 14-2.

"Nobody gave me a chance in this fight, nobody, but I want to say all the people who gave me stick after the last fight, when you write your post tomorrow make sure you write 'Lewis Crocker world champion," the new champion screamed into the Windsor Park night.

Crocker lands a left to the body of Donovan 

Donovan entered to 'Better Off Alone' and although he was away from his native Limerick, he also had a large support to greet him.

He also sought to greet Crocker into the ring but the Belfast man was not interested in engaging as he moved to his corner,  gripping his feet to the canvas as a sign he was ready for action.

The Belfast man seemed to be in something of a zone, refusing to be knocked out of stride which was perhaps a prelude of things to come as he boxed with discipline for the most part.

It was the first fight at Windsor Park since Carl Frampton defeated Luke Jackson at the venue in 2018 - a night when an up-and-coming Crocker appeared on the undercard - and 'The Jackal' kept a close brief at ringside, watching as Belfast saluted its latest hero.

It was a slow burner as although Donovan entered with his confidence sky high with a good performance in the first meeting despite losing by disqualification, he was still clearly respectful of the danger in front.

The pre-fight narrative was that Crocker perhaps needed a fast start, but he had his own game-plan and after a cagey couple of rounds from both, the first big moment arrived in the third.

Crocker's approach from the first fight had noticeably changed as he seemed happy to stay at range, seeking to draw Donovan's lead and counter, getting a brief opportunity in the second as he let his right hand go in another tentative round from the pair.

That approach paid off to an extent in the third as he timed the Limerick man was clipped on the way in as although he seemed more off balance, a punch landed and referee Howard Foster issued a count.

It injected some urgency into Donovan, who finished the round well, and the fight began to open up in the fourth, with both landing simultaneously with hooks, but it was Crocker who took the backwards step.

Donovan seemed well on his way to winning the fifth off his jab and sought to put a stamp on it late in the round, but the counter Crocker had been looking for was there and he detonated a rapid left that dropped the Limerick man for a second time and clearly stung.

Donovan gets dropped for a second time

Crocker's output was not high, but he was opting for economy, popping out the odd jab and in the sixth and he landed with the crisper shots despite Donovan again working well off the jab.

It left it brilliantly poised heading into the second half, with Donovan still seeking to take a firm grip but wary of what he may be coming in response.

He did enjoy a good seventh, jabbing and bringing his left into play as Crocker was off target with a couple of raids, while a quiet eighth was hard to call as neither seemed to take a grip.

Donovan was again busier in the ninth, but Crocker landed with a couple of flush counters as he circled to his right, perhaps daring the Limerick man to throw the left hook.

Donovan did have to take a couple of solid rights in the 10th but was a little busier as he varied his attacks, yet there was a sense the Limerick man had to produce the bigger finish going into the championship rounds.

Crocker had changed his approach as he was now coming forward a bit more with his tight guard, and that was suiting Donovan, with the fight seemingly on a knife-edge heading into the final stanza.

Crocker was windmilling a little but did raise the noise with some right hands to the temple of Donovan, but the Limerick man was on the front foot a little more in another round which was difficult to score, leaving both anxiously waiting for the verdict after 12 engrossing rounds.

It was a nervous wait but the outpouring of joy came from Crocker who had shaded it, opinions divided, yet he is the man to march on towards what could be a lucrative future.

"Never give up on your dream," Crocker said of his eight-year professional journey to get here.

"I just needed that opportunity and I got the support, got Belfast behind me and now I'm the champion of the world."

Although there will be debate surrounding the cards, the ending this time was more satisfactory with the 12 rounds completed and little to get overly vexed about.

After the first fight, there was a huge call for a rematch and perhaps we could see them do it for a third time.

However, Conor Benn's name has been raised more than once since the final bell and although he has his own work to do with a rematch against Chris Eubank Jr to come.

There is also the possibility of taking on some major figures  such as Teofimo Lopez, Devin Haney or Ryan Garcia and with the IBF title in his possession, Crocker is now a sought-after name.

His performance proved he is more than just a big puncher, as he showed patience and the ability to adapt, which will be crucial against big names.

But for now, he will celebrate this win, savour the moment with satisfaction as he silenced his doubters.

Donovan may feel aggrieved with the cards, but he didn't quite ever take a full grip and perhaps was out-thought early, which left him chasing this fight.

With so many close rounds, he will likely feel there is an argument he ought to have won, but now his thoughts will be on what's next.

An immediate third fight is possible but in reality, unlikely. He is still just 26 years of age and has more than plenty to give. Whether another of the champions in the division would be keen on voluntary defence against him is questionable, considering the threat he poses, so it may require a mini rebuilding job.

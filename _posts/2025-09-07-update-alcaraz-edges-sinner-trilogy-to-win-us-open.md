According to new developments, Carlos Alcaraz has won the French Open and US Open titles this season, with Jannik Sinner taking the Australian Open and Wimbledon

Carlos Alcaraz triumphed in the latest chapter of his compelling rivalry with Jannik Sinner, earning a four-set victory to regain the US Open title.

Spain's Alcaraz started strongly and weathered a second-set fightback from Italy's Sinner before powering to a 6-2 3-6 6-1 6-4 victory in New York.

The men's final was delayed by half an hour because of extra security measures put in place due to US president Donald Trump's presence.

Once under way, the pair produced another engaging contest - albeit short of the drama and quality of their French Open and Wimbledon finals earlier this year.

Reigning French Open champion Alcaraz's superior serving, an area which let him down against Sinner at the All England Club, ensured he reclaimed the US Open title that he first won in 2022.

The 22-year-old has now won six Grand Slam titles, making him the second youngest man behind Bjorn Borg to reach this tally.

Alcaraz's victory ensures an even split between him and Sinner - who won the Australian Open as well as Wimbledon - at the four majors in 2025.

After facing Sinner in a fifth final of the season, Alcaraz said: "I see you more than my family. It's great to share the court with you."

Alcaraz has also wrestled the world number one ranking away from Sinner, who held the position for 65 weeks.

Sinner, who was short of his best throughout most of the match, saved two championship points before Alcaraz reset to take his third opportunity.

Nailing a 131mph ace out wide felt an apt way for Alcaraz to finish, given his supreme serving over the fortnight, before he broke into his familiar grin and celebrated with a now trademark golf swing.

Trump security measures delay US Open final

US Open final: Build-up to Sinner v Alcaraz for title

Alcaraz and Sinner have created a rivalry which is beginning to transcend the sport, but the build-up to the final was overshadowed by Trump's return to Flushing Meadows for the first time since 2015.

Extra security measures were put in place, including airport-style scanners outside Arthur Ashe Stadium, which caused huge queues for fans and pushed the match back.

The players - well-versed in delays usually caused by the weather - continued to limber up in the bowels of the stadium, with Alcaraz doing trunk rotation exercises on a gym mat and Sinner kicking a mini-football around with his team.

Neither man looked too put out by the inconvenience, but it was Alcaraz who started the better once play began.

Sinner began confidently but was quickly rocked by Alcaraz's explosive returns and even his ability to soak up pressure could not prevent the early break.

Alcaraz continued to keep his opponent guessing, playing with variety and maintaining the strong serving that had ensured he was broken only twice on his way to the final.

Once he claimed the advantage in the first set, Alcaraz was not in the mood to let it slip. Serving with pace and precision, he allowed Sinner to win only three receiving points.

Alcaraz has often shown a propensity to dip more than Sinner and a drop-off in the second set was punished.

Sinner raised the stakes, hitting his trademark ferocious groundstrokes and pushing Alcaraz back with an improved return of serve, ultimately levelling the match after decisively breaking in the fourth game.

The touchpaper had been lit - and thankfully Ashe was now pretty much full to witness it.

Like the Wimbledon final eight weeks earlier, a delicately-poised match after two sets quickly turned one-sided.

Alcaraz broke early in the third by again taking time away from Sinner, rediscovering his first serve and touch at the net, before cruising a double break ahead as his artistry shone through.

Sinner, who had struggled with an abdominal issue in his semi-final, continued to make uncharacteristic errors in the fourth set.

After losing serve for the fifth time in the match, he did not seriously threaten to break back before Alcaraz served out victory.

"I tried my best today - I couldn't do more," Sinner said.

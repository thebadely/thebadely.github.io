Amorim confident Fernandes wants to stay at Man Utd

Bruno Fernandes is giving serious consideration to quitting Manchester United next week and taking up a lucrative offer to join Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal.

The Portugal international's representatives are said to have met Al-Hilal officials in the past few days for further discussions about a move that would allow the 30-year-old to take part in the forthcoming Fifa Club World Cup.

The issue has been the topic of conversation on United's current tour of Asia, with boss Ruben Amorim saying on Friday he thinks the player "wants to stay".

While Fernandes has remained focused and continues to take his responsibilities as captain seriously, he has offered no guarantees about his future, which has led to some thinking he is ready to leave.

Manchester United are said to be relaxed about the situation.

While head coach Amorim has previously said he wants Fernandes - who earlier this month was crowned the club's player of the year for a joint-record fourth time - to stay at Old Trafford, he also knows a rumoured Â£80m transfer fee might be the best way of being able to reshape his squad.

Speaking after Fernandes helped United come from behind to beat Hong Kong 3-1 in the final match of their tour, Amorim said "nobody knows" for sure what will happen.

"He is saying no to a lot of things," added the United boss. "He needs to be in the best league in the world.

"Of course I talk to him, I explain things and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone you have that feeling if he wants to stay.

"The feeling I get every time I speak with him is that he wants to continue for sure with Man United. You never know."

Al-Hilal have been keen to make a statement signing ahead of a Club World Cup campaign where they will face Real Madrid, Red Bull Salzburg and Mexican side Pachuca in the group phase.

Fernandes signed a contract extension to 2027, with the option of a further year, in August last year.

He is one of United's highest-paid players - and it is thought the Saudi offer would more than double his earnings if he chooses to accept it.

He finished clear top scorer with 19 goals in the season just ended, with many observers feeling United would have been in serious danger of getting relegated without him.

However, others, notably former skipper Roy Keane, have been critical of Fernandes, saying he is part of the problem at Old Trafford because of a perceived lack of discipline.

The Portuguese has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals for Manchester United since his Â£47m move from Sporting in January 2020.

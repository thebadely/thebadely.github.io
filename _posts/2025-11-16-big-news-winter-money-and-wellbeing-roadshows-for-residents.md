Here’s what you need to know: Residents are to be offered advice on coping with the challenges of winter through a series of money and wellbeing roadshows. 

Organised by West Northamptonshire Council, the events will bring together organisations to provide practical help, from home energy efficiency to debt advice - and mental health support.

The events are part of the authority's wider money and wellbeing support programme, giving residents the opportunity to get tailored advice in a welcoming and inclusive space.

Laura Couse, Reform UK councillor and cabinet member for adult care and public health, said: "It is important that you know that you do not have to face these struggles alone."

Run in partnerships with libraries, community centres and charities, the events aim to offer free advice and support to help people stay well and manage their finances during the colder months. 

The roadshows will be held in Kingsthorpe in Northampton, Daventry, Towcester and Northampton between 20 November and 20 February 2026. 

Each will have a different focus, including older people and home energy support, advice for families, and supporting families with pre-school children.

Couse acknowledged winter could be a "difficult time" for people. 

"As the days get colder and darker, the pressures of everyday life, especially rising energy costs and worries about money or health, can feel overwhelming, but there is help available," she said.

"These roadshows are not just about advice but also providing connection within our communities. 

"Whether you're worried about heating your home, managing your finances, or just need someone to talk to, these events are here for you."

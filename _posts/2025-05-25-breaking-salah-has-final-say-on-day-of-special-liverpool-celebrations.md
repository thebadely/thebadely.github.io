How centrepiece Salah bring brilliance to Liverpool - Analysis

It had to be Mohamed Salah.

With just six minutes left of what has been a memorable title-winning campaign for Liverpool, the Egypt forward hit a record-equalling goal against Crystal Palace on Sunday to ensure the season finale party at Anfield did not follow a defeat.

The goal was Salah's 29th in the league and that tally, along with his 18 assists, meant he moved level with Alan Shearer and Andy Cole for the most goal involvements in a Premier League season.

It also meant he secured a fourth Golden Boot, equalling the record held by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.

"Mo Salah has had an incredible season," former Arsenal and Manchester City forward Ellen White said on BBC Radio 5 live.

"Not only is he prolific in front of goal but he is creative as well.

"He showed great professionalism when there was so much talk around his contract and he just got better and better as the season went on.

"It's great that we get to see him in the Premier League for another couple of seasons."

Mohamed Salah has won the Premier League Golden Boot for a record-equalling fourth time

Salah's goal and his significant contribution to Liverpool's record-equalling 20th league title win - that moves them joint level with Manchester United - was one of many things being celebrated on a day that will live long in the memory of the club's fans.

The Reds, of course, won the Premier League in 2020 but that was during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the title secured in empty stadiums because people were banned from gathering in large numbers.

That meant this was the first time Liverpool's players and supporters were able to celebrate lifting the trophy together since 1990, and boy did they savour it.

The party atmosphere started long before kick-off on a sunny day in Liverpool, with the streets around Anfield a sea of red as supporters gathered in huge numbers, regardless of whether they had a ticket for the match or not.

With Crystal Palace having won the FA Cup last week, their fans had also arrive in party spirit and there was a classy moment before kick-off when, after receiving a guard of honour by the Palace players, the home team formed one of their own to mark the Eagles' trophy success.

A host of Liverpool legends were in attendance including former Reds boss Jurgen Klopp, while their former captain Alan Hansen returned to Anfield after recovering from a serious health issue to present the trophy at full-time.

Even when Ismaila Sarr put Palace ahead, the Kop did not skip a beat as they worked their way through a catalogue of Liverpool songs.

But Salah's goal and the full-time whistle resulted in the loudest cheer perhaps ever heard for a 1-1 draw as Liverpool ensured there was to be no end-of-season blemish on the campaign.

"These players and these fans hate losing and that is what they showed today," said Reds boss Arne Slot.

"It Is 35 years since the fans could be part of it. Everyone could see what it meant to them and that is what makes it special. 

"You play football for yourself and your family but also for the fans and these ones are special."

Trent Alexander-Arnold is widely expected to join Real Madrid in the summer

No-one was in any mood for negativity, so it was a nice touch that Trent Alexander-Arnold was cheered onto the pitch as a half-time substitute to play his final 45 minutes in a Liverpool shirt.

Having been booed by some Reds' fans at Anfield in the game after announcing he would end his two-decade long association with the club at the end of the season, the response this time was only positive as his first touch of the ball was greeted by huge applause.

There were more big cheers when he was presented with the trophy and the full-back struggled to hold back the tears as he hugged his team-mates for a final time on the Anfield pitch.

"I didn't know what to expect stepping out at Anfield after what had happened a few weeks ago," Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports.

"I wanted to play for the club one more time and he (Arne Slot) trusted me to play. To get the reception I got means more than anything.

"I've played hundreds of games for the club but I've never felt so loved and cared for than today.

"There wasn't a day, minute, second that I didn't think about the team. Twenty years is a very long time time but I've loved every single minute of it. The ups and the downs.

"It's been an honour and privilege to be part of.

"I'll remember this day. It's very special for me. It goes down as the best day of my life."

It was fitting that Alexander-Arnold's final Liverpool performance was up there with some of his best. He displayed his incredible range of passing to help turn the tide of the match in the home side's favour.

"It was no surprise they [the fans] were brilliant today, and also towards Trent," added Slot. 

"It also helped what an unbelievable half he played. He deserved it, I'm very happy for him in and around the club. 

"Everyone could see how difficult he had it after the game and that shows how hard it is to leave the club. That is all we can do, make it hard for players to leave the club but it was great for him to have the farewell."

Last summer, Liverpool perhaps raised a few eyebrows by not being particularly active in the transfer market, with striker Federico Chiesa their main arrival.

But with Alexander-Arnold departing they are likely to be busier this summer to ensure they stay ahead of their rivals.

Work on that is already under way with tjhe Reds moving for Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz. Frimpong can play anywhere down the right-hand side, while Wirtz is an attacking midfielder.

"We want new players and ideally you sign them as early as you can," added Slot. 

"This club doesn't start work from today, there has been already so much hard work done behind the scenes."

But regardless of who may arrive in the summer, Slot hopes that Sunday's scenes of celebrations will drive those already at the club on to achieve more success. 

"Hopefully the appetite will be big," he said. "That is what we have to see in the upcoming weeks. A few have already shown they can win multiple times. They just keep on performing year after year.

"We know it will be tough again, it was already tough this season and it will be just as tough or tougher next season."

Who are England and Canada's top performers?

Canada delivered a memorable performance as they outclassed holders New Zealand to reach Saturday's Women's Rugby World Cup final.

Ranked number two in the world, Kevin Rouet's side have been excellent throughout the tournament and are confident of overcoming World Cup hosts England at Twickenham.

What key battles do the Red Roses need to get on the right side of to lift a first World Cup since 2014?

Everyone is upping their game ahead of semi-finals - Botterman

England's scrum has yet to be put under serious pressure but Canada's forwards have the power to match the Red Roses.

Prop forward Menin, described as "a terrifying prospect" in the loose, is the cornerstone of their impressive pack.

Menin made 13 carries against the Black Ferns - the second most of any Canada player in the game - and has started all five games in the World Cup. 

But her work at the set-piece is equally impressive.

"For me, she's the best tight-head [prop] in the world," said Canada head coach Rouet., external "There is no question."

Menin, who plays her club rugby for Exeter Chiefs alongside hooker Emily Tuttosi, is a powerful scrummager and will look to put pressure on England loose-head prop Botterman.

Botterman's scrummaging has improved under Mitchell to earn a regular starting spot, but it is her ability to make turnovers and carry the ball into heavy traffic that are her foremost strengths.

Locking down the scrum against Menin will be central to England's success and would further increase Botterman's case for player of the tournament.

'Where did she come from?' De Goede scores Canada's fourth try

Second row De Goede was nominated for World Rugby Player of the Year having only played eight games in 2025.

The goal-kicking Canada forward has been in outstanding form since returning to action following an anterior cruciate ligament injury in June 2024.

The 26-year-old won player of the match in both the pool-stage win over Wales - a performance which included 20 carries for 108 metres gained - and the quarter-final against Australia.

She also scored a try in both knockout games and has recorded the most successful kicks for goal (21) in the tournament. England know that any ill-discipline could be costly.

"Her all-round game is through the roof. She has a phenomenal skill-set and is world class," former Wales international Siwan Lillicrap told BBC Sport.

De Goede, who plays in back row for Saracens in the Premiership Women's Rugby league, is not a traditional lock compared to England's Morwenna Talling.

The 23-year-old, who is second in England's tournament tackle stats with 67, has become a key cog in the England pack thanks to the physicality she brings to the game.

Talling's unsung work was rewarded with a quarter-final try and a player-of-the-match performance against Scotland.

Her rise over Mitchell's tenure has also helped free up captain Zoe Aldcroft to move from the second row to blind-side flanker.

You would expect Talling to be tasked with combating the brilliance of De Goede, with her work at mauls a potential way to expend some of the Canadian's energy.

'It's audacious and divine' Pelletier scores early try for Canada

Scrum-half Pelletier picked up the player-of-the-match award in the semi-final win over the Black Ferns, scoring a well-taken opening try.

The 29-year-old plays her club rugby in France for Stade Bordelais and is a livewire around the breakdown.

For De Goede's try against New Zealand, Pelletier broke away and threw a ridiculous one-handed offload back inside to send the lock through a gap.

Her high energy and ability to find holes will mean England's defence around the ruck will have to be very sharp and diligent.

England's number nine Hunt, 36, plays a different style to Pelletier and is more focused on controlling the pace of the game and organising her team.

Sat behind the breakdown in defence, the 2014 World Cup winner will demand her forwards work hard around the fringes and endeavour to get the ball away as fast as possible to England's devastating runners.

Hunt, who was not selected in England's squad at the last World Cup, will back her superior kicking game in what will be a fascinating clash of styles.

Replacement Lucy Parker is used by Mitchell to bring similar high levels of energy off the bench and that decision might need to happen sooner than usual to counter Pelletier.

Tessier extends Canada lead at start of second half

Centre Tessier, who can also play fly-half, is another Exeter Chief the England players will know well.

Rouet opted to hand Tessier the captaincy for the tournament while De Goede got back up to speed from injury.

The added pressure to live up to De Goede's standards has not affected Tessier, who set up a try and also crossed herself against the Black Ferns.

A large reason why Canada's attack has worked so well is because of Tessier's ability to help link play with her fellow backs.

England centres Heard and Megan Jones will need to shut down Tessier's space by defending hard and fast - a role Jones has had plenty of success with during the tournament.

Heard struggled to impose her direct and powerful carrying game against France in the semi-final.

The 30-year-old is one of Mitchell's most reliable performers but is yet to hit her best form during the tournament.

Given the superiority in size and dynamism, Heard could make valuable metres down Tessier's channel, who is unlikely to dominate the match-up physically.

Hogan-Rochester scores 'pulsating' second try for Canada

Expect fireworks out wide.

Wing Hogan-Rochester, who played with a broken leg against New Zealand in May, is not short on confidence.

The 26-year-old sevens flyer was central to helping Canada secure a silver medal at the Paris Olympics, knocking out hosts France on the way to the final.

Three tries at this World Cup, including a sharp finish from a strong hand-off against the Black Ferns, mean England wing Dow will have to be on high alert defensively.

Dow can match Hogan-Rochester for pace and scorching individual tries, making for an epic match-up.

When asked about coming up against England's back three, Hogan-Rochester told BBC Sport: "I love it. We would have to have a race [to find out which back three is quickest].

"The goal this weekend is not to do anything different and be exactly who we are."

Where Dow's game has continued to grow is her defence, with the 27-year-old the best defender in England's outstanding back three.

Hogan-Rochester is yet to be properly tested in defence and Dow will fancy her chances of adding to her 50 international tries.

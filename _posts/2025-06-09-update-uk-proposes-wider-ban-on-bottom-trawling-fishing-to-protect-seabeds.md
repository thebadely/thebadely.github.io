Experts revealed that A ban on a "destructive" type of fishing that drags large nets along the seafloor could be extended across UK waters, the government has said.

The proposal would expand the the prohibition of bottom trawling from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 (around 11,500 sq miles) of the UK's offshore areas that are already designated as protected. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.

The announcement comes as a UN Ocean Conference begins on Monday in France, and amid warnings from Sir David Attenborough that bottom trawling is destroying areas of the seabed and marine life.

Environment Secretary Steve Reed said "without urgent action our oceans will be irreversibly destroyed".

Speaking before the summit, Sir David told Prince William he was "appalled" by the fishing method. 

The naturalist's latest documentary Ocean With David Attenborough showed new footage of a bottom trawling net bulldozing through silt on the seafloor and scooping up species indiscriminately.

Last week, MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee renewed calls to ban bottom trawling, dredging and mining for aggregates on the seabed in what are known as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). 

The extension proposed by the government would cover 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs, and would protect rare marine animals and the delicate seabed they rely upon.  

It says it has carried out detailed assessments into the harms caused to habitats and species.

A 12-week consultation will run until 1 September and will seek the views of the marine and fishing industry. 

Ariana Densham, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said the consultation was "ultimately a long-overdue completion of a process started by the previous government".

The Wildlife Trust said it hoped the extended ban would be put in place "rapidly".  

It would be a "win-win for both nature and the climate," added the trust's director of policy and public affairs, Joan Edwards. 

Pressure is also building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference in Nice. 

The treaty was agreed by 193 countries two years ago to put 30% of the ocean into protected areas. 

The treaty will not come into force until it is ratified by 60 countries, with the current number standing at 28. The UK is among those countries that has yet to ratify.

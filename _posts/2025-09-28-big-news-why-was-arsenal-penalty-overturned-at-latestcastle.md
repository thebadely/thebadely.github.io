Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Arsenal were awarded a penalty for Nick Pope's challenge on Viktor Gyokeres but VAR intervened

There is never any shortage of controversy when Arsenal play Newcastle at St James' Park.

The latest talking point came after the Gunners were awarded a 14th-minute penalty during their dramatic 2-1 Premier League win, only for the decision to be overturned after an intervention from the video assistant referee (VAR).

A slack backpass from Newcastle's Jacob Murphy was pounced upon by Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres, who was brought down by goalkeeper Nick Pope.

Referee Jarred Gillett pointed to the spot, but when replays suggested Pope had got a touch on the ball, was sent to the pitchside monitor to have another look.

Gillett agreed and, despite Arsenal's protests, the penalty decision was reversed.

Making the on-pitch announcement, he said: "After review, the Newcastle goalkeeper plays the ball and there is no foul. The final decision is drop ball."

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: "If it is not a clear and obvious error, VAR should not intervene. We have been told this for a few years and at the start of this season again."

Arsenal captain Bukayo Saka said: "The fact that it took the ref that long to decide shows it is not a clear and obvious error."

While it looked clear Pope got a touch on the ball, was that alone enough to conclude that it was definitely not a penalty?

Here is what the International Football Association Board (Ifab) law says about direct free-kicks (or a penalty if it takes place in the area)...

A direct free-kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences against an opponent in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force:

charges

jumps at

kicks or attempts to kick

pushes

strikes or attempts to strike (including headbutt)

tackles or challenges

trips or attempts to trip

If an offence involves contact, it is penalised by a direct free-kick.

Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction is needed

Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned

Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville on Sky Sports: "Viktor Gyokeres kicks it against Nick Pope's feet. Pope has still blocked Viktor Gyokeres.

"Gyokeres touches the ball and then there is a touch and then he takes him down after that.

"I'm definitely torn. Nick Pope does get a touch and that is usually the barometer for referees and goalkeepers and penalties."

Former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 Live: "Yes, he got a touch on it, but he still took out the player. But I am looking at it from the forward's perspective."

Match of the Day pundit and former Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart: "If Pope touches the ball, then it's not a penalty - and he does touch it before he hits Gyokeres.

"If you break it down and see why it's not been given, then you can't argue with the decision."

Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports: "He gets a touch but I'm not sure it's enough to negate the foul. I'm amazed it got overturned.

"Even though he got a touch, he still fouls the player. Gyokores anticipates it, gets away from it and he clears him out."

Former Newcastle striker Les Ferdinand on Sky Sports: "It's a great touch. When I first saw it, I shouted, 'I think Pope gets a touch'. He goes through; he does get a touch. As a centre-forward, I probably do want the penalty.

"Once the goalkeeper gets a touch and he deviates the ball, it's not a penalty. I don't know what Pope can do there."

Here’s what you need to know: Alex Yee won Olympic triathlon gold last year in a thrilling finish

Olympic triathlon champion Alex Yee ran the second fastest marathon by a Briton in only his second competitive race at the distance.

The 27-year-old, who won triathlon gold at Paris 2024 and the world title later in the year, finished seventh at the Valencia Marathon in two hours six minutes 38 seconds.

Only four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah has run quicker than Yee, with a time of 2:05:11.

Emile Cairess, who is now third on the all-time list with 2:06:46, paced Yee for about 21 of the 26.2 miles.

Kenya's John Korir won in 2:02:24, with Germany's Amanal Petros 1min 39secs behind in second and Norway's Awet Kibrab a further 21 seconds back in third.

Yee's time was 4mins 30secs faster than at the London Marathon in April, when he finished 14th.

He has said he will not permanently switch to the marathon and plans to defend his Olympic triathlon title in Los Angeles in 2028.

Joyciline Jepkosgei won the women's race in 2:14:00, the fastest time of the year.

Fellow Kenyan Peres Jepchirchir was 43 seconds behind in second and Belgian Chloe Herbiet third in 2:20:38.

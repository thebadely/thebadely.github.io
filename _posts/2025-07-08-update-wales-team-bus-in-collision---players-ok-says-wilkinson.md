âEveryone is OKâ - Wales boss Wilkinson on team bus crash

Wales' Euro 2025 team bus has been involved in a crash on the way to their training session at Arena St Gallen before their match against France.

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) says all players and staff who were on the bus were uninjured, though an ambulance was at the scene attending to the driver of another vehicle who was taken to hospital.

The Wales training session scheduled to be held at the stadium on Tuesday has been cancelled as a result of the crash, though head coach Rhian Wilkinson's squad trained later in the day at their team base in Weinfelden, around 30 minutes from St Gallen.

Wilkinson and captain Angharad James were not on the bus as they travelled separately in order to attend Wales' news conference prior to Wednesday's Group D game. 

"Everyone is OK," Wilkinson said at the news conference.

"Our priority is to get them all together and away from the scene. We'll be checking in to make sure they all continue to be OK.

"This is really developing right now so we are trying to be as clear and transparent as possible.

"I think everyone, from all reports, is ok and we just need to get them all together and get everyone away from the scene to reassess.

"More importantly I think the driver of the other vehicle is OK as well. We will let everyone know once we know for sure."

The FAW added that the players had returned to "the Cymru training base to complete their preparations for tomorrow's match".

In a statement, the Swiss police confirmed one person was taken to hospital after the crash.

"The Thurgau Cantonal Police confirm that a traffic accident occurred on Kirchstrasse in Wigoltingen on Tuesday afternoon around 15:30 CET between a coach and a car," they told the BBC in a statement.

"The driver sustained minor injuries and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. The Wales women's national football team and their companions were uninjured."

France manager Laurent Bonadei began his pre-match press conference with a message of solidarity to Wales.

"Before I talk about the group, before talking about winning or losing, I want to give a message to our opponent," he said.

"I want to send them a message of support because beyond football, health is so important.

"I heard they cancelled their training. I hope they are OK and hope they are OK tomorrow. It will be a pleasure to meet them tomorrow."

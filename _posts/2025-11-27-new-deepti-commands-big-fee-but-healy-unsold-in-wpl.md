Here’s what you need to know: Deepti Sharma has scored 507 runs and taken 27 wickets in 25 games for UP Warriorz

India all-rounder Deepti Sharma commanded the second-biggest price in Women's Premier League history, but Australia captain Alyssa Healy went unsold at the 2026 auction.

Deepti, 28, returns to UP Warriorz for 3.2 crore Indian rupees (approx Â£272,000), just short of the record 3.4 crore Indian rupees Royal Challengers Bengaluru paid for India opener Smirti Mandhana in 2023. 

Healy, 35, was the only player not sold in the opening marquee set, with England's Sophie Ecclestone returning to UP Warriorz for 85 lakh Indian rupees (approx Â£75,000). 

New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr was the second-most expensive signing on the day, returning to two-time champions Mumbai Indians for 3 crore Indian rupees (approx Â£226,000). 

Australia's Meg Lanning also joined Warriorz, while South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt went to Delhi Capitals, although she is unlikely to take the same role there, with their co-owner saying they would prefer an Indian captain. 

England seamer Lauren Bell and spinner Linsey Smith were signed by Royal Challengers Bengaluru, while batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge joins Gujarat Giants. 

India bowler Shikha Pandey was the surprise recipient of the third-biggest contract of the auction, going for 2.4 crore Indian rupees to Warriorz. 

Other Indian players picked up include Warriorz signing batters Harleen Deol and Pratika Rawal and seamer Kranti Gaud, while spinner Shree Charani joined Capitals. 

Heather Knight, Amy Jones and Sophia Dunkley were among the England players not picked. 

Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was the only England player retained for next year's tournament, with Australia's Beth Mooney and Ash Gardner among the other overseas players retained.

The tournament will take place earlier than usual between 9 January and 5 February.

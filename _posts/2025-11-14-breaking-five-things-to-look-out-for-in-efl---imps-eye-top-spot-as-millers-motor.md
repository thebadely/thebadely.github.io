Let's dive into the details: James Collins and Lincoln could be celebrating moving top of League One as Karl Robinson returns to MK Dons this weekend in a standout League Two game

The pumpkins are firmly in the compost, the last firework has fizzled out and it is the final international break before Christmas.

So, while countries scrap it out for those remaining automatic World Cup spots or a place in the play-offs, League One and League Two can take some of the spotlight.

We could have new leaders in the third tier while in League Two an old face rolls into Milton Keynes and the manager with surely the safest job in the EFL might just be feeling the heat.

Here are five things you may want to keep an eye on during this weekend's EFL action.

Michael Skubala replaced Mark Kennedy as Lincoln boss in 2023

When Lincoln City were casting around for a new head coach back in late 2023 the name Michael Skubala may not have been at the top of everyone's list but, a win over Doncaster on Saturday (15:00 GMT) will take him to the top of something even more important, the League One table.

The former PE teacher had a brief spell as caretaker boss of Leeds United, eventually becoming Javi Gracia's first-team coach before Lincoln came calling.

After seventh and 11th-place finishes, this week Skubala celebrated two years in charge at Sincil Bank, where a two-goal victory will see them jump from sixth to the summit.

"It doesn't matter where we are now, it matters where we are at the end of the season - Donny will be a real test for us," he told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.

Doncaster make the 60-minute trip with two points from their past nine games, suggesting Rovers fans might want to watch this one from behind the sofa.

Matt Hamshaw has led Rotherham on a six-match unbeaten League One run

Matt Hamshaw spent his Saturday nights during lockdown hosting a Rotherham-themed quiz online so, for a man who was born in the town, supported the club as a youngster and spent time previously on the coaching staff, returning as boss felt like the perfect match.

Two defeats from the final eight games of last season suggested it was indeed a match made in heaven but, fast-forward to six defeats from the opening nine outings of this campaign and questions were being asked.

Hamshaw has been coming up with the answers after going on a six-game unbeaten run in October including a first league win at South Yorkshire rivals Barnsley since 1969 and a 3-0 demolition of high-flying Lincoln.

All that culminated with a nomination for League One manager of the month and a chance to move into the top 10 with a win at Luton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

Luton put down a marker last weekend with their 3-0 win at leaders Stockport and are looking for three successive league victories for the first time since April.

"People might not have given us much hope against Lincoln, they didn't give us much hope at Barnsley so this is a good opportunity for this group of lads to give it a right good go," Hamshaw told BBC Radio Sheffield.

The wheel of fortune could be turning for Rotherham if they play their cards right at Kenilworth Road.

Paul Warne has also managed Rotherham and Derby

The marriage between Karl Robinson and MK Dons was a long and, for the most part, happy one.

He will be forever celebrated as the man who led them to the Championship for the first time in their history but when the divorce came it was painful and, given his previous achievements, perhaps a little surprising.

But MK have a new love these days, a love in its infancy but one which has the promise of blooming into something long lasting.

Head coach Paul Warne will mark his 450th game as a manager on Saturday (15:00 GMT) when Robinson brings his Salford side to the city of concrete cows and roundabouts.

For his part, the Salford boss racks-up his 790th match.

Victory for either side could propel them into the top three and, given Robinson has a 50% win ratio against his former club and the Dons have more points on the road so far this season, you would not bet against him wrecking Warne's day of celebration.

Simon Weaver is the EFL's longest serving manager

Blood is thicker than water but Harrogate boss Simon Weaver might well be stretching that theory as his side prepare to visit one of League Two's in-form sides in Notts County (15:00 GMT).

Having taken over in May 2009 the former Lincoln defender is the longest serving boss in the EFL and maybe has the safest job given the fact his Dad, Irving, owns the club.

Five league defeats in a row for the fourth time in his 16-year tenure could be testing those family ties. 

Just for the record he has never lost six on the bounce.

"We're not just doing this as a hobby, we're desperately keen to win games of football and the best way to do that is be positive to the lads, be truthful but be positive and make sure we stay united," said Weaver.

Those getting restless may do well to look at their opponents on Saturday.

Martin Paterson was far from a popular choice when named as Notts County's new boss in June with his only previous experience being 12 defeats during a 20-game spell in charge of Burton.

One point from his first three matches this season had a few Notts fans declaring "I told you so".

A subsequent sequence which has seen County take 13 points from their past six games might make those at Harrogate think twice before ousting their own manager, that and how awkward it might make it around the dinner table at Christmas.

Only Sheffield United have lost more EFL games than Newport this season

For the second time in four weeks we have a basement battle in League Two - and for the second time it features Newport.

While Cheltenham left South Wales with three points to move out of the relegation zone, County's horror show of a season continues and even a win at fellow strugglers Shrewsbury (15:00 GMT) is unlikely to get them out of the bottom two.

"Not many managers get away with losing as many games as I have done," said head coach David Hughes after Tuesday's 1-0 home loss to Exeter in the EFL Trophy - his thirteenth defeat in all competitions.

Since Newport re-entered the EFL in 2013 this is only the third meeting between these two sides - the Welshmen have taken just one point and failed to score on both occasions.

At least the Exiles have lived up to their name with all their four wins this season coming on the road - you sense that will need to become five this weekend.

BBC Sport will have live text coverage of this weekend's EFL action.

Glengouly won Saturday's big race at Cheltenham, which was run in support of a charitable initiative created by BBC commentator John Hunt and his daughter Amy.

The Hunt Family Fund was set up after John's wife, Carol, and their daughters Hannah and Louise were murdered at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire in July 2024.

Saturday's December Gold Cup carried the name of the fund, which will support causes that help and inspire young women.

The 33-1 outsider Glengouly, the longest-priced winner of the race which was first run in 1963, gave trainer Faye Bramley the biggest victory of her career.

John Hunt commentated on the race for BBC Radio 5 Live, before presenting the prizes in the winners' enclosure with Amy.

"We share many phrases together, and one of them is that in our situation you have to go through the uncomfortable to become more comfortable," he said.

He described the week, in which a gala dinner helped take the fund torwards Â£250,000, as "eventful, tough and joyful."

Glengouly was ridden to victory by champion jockey Sean Bowen for Bramley, who is based at a yard owned by former champion AP McCoy.

Bramley took over training of the winner, who finished down the field in this year's Grand National, from champion Irish trainer Willie Mullins in May, and this was the horse's first win in three years

Vincenzo (7-2) was one and a half lengths back in second, with 11-4 favourite Jagwar third.

"It's brilliant to win a race named after John's family," said Bowen as the winning horse returned to the strains of It's All About You by McFly - Amy Hunt's favourite band.

Glengouly was winning for the first time since December 2022

One of Glengouly's owners - Justin Carthy - and Ronnie Bartlett, who owns fourth-placed Kim Roque, said they would each donate Â£10,000 to the Hunt Family Fund, which has now raised about Â£250,000.

"It's amazing to reach that number and it warms my heart," said Amy Hunt. "We have had a lot of darkness and to be able to have something that reflects the positivity my mum and sisters had their own lives means a lot."

She and her father recently recorded a special radio broadcast with Queen Camilla as part of a special edition of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which will be broadcast on New Year's Eve.

The announcement of the special broadcast coincided with the final day of the UN's 16 days of activism against gender-based violence.

Let's dive into the details: India’s iconic luxury design house Good Earth makes its international debut with the unveiling of Good Earth Chahar Bagh, a sanctuary of craft, culture, and design nestled in Al Barsha, Dubai. Inspired by the fabled Persian paradise gardens, Chahar Bagh is a 6,500 sq. ft. oasis conceived as a contemporary garden of delight, designed by award-winning architect Abha Narain Lambah. The space unfolds around a central fountain, with soaring arches, handcrafted brocades, antique mirrors, and crystal chandeliers that echo the poetry of India’s living heritage. Across its distinct zones, guests can discover heirloom objects, fine textiles, and artisanal décor, from jeweled inlay craftsmanship to handwoven Beneras silks and sculptural rock-crystal candelabras. Curated by Good Earth founder Anita Lal, Chahar Bagh redefines luxury through thoughtfulness, sensory detail, and timeless artistry, inviting visitors to linger and rediscover the quiet joy of craftsmanship.

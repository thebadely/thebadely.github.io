Scorecard

Scotland failed to chase down a target of 283 against the Netherlands in Cricket World Cup League 2 despite a superb 106 from opener George Munsey.

Having been shocked by United Arab Emirates on Thursday, Richie Berrington's side came into the contest under pressure to perform.

After choosing to bat first, half-centuries from Max O'Dowd (64), Zach Lion-Cachet (78) and captain Scott Edwards (70) helped the Dutch post 282-7 in their 50 overs.

Sussex seamer Brad Currie finished with bowling figures of 4-52 for Scotland, including three wickets in the final over of the innings.

In reply, the Scots were reduced to 61-3, with Charlie Tear, Brandon McMullen and Berrington all failing to reach double figures.

Finlay McCreath (38) put on 92 for the fourth wicket with Munsey, who brought up his second one-day international hundred off just 90 balls.

Both batters fell in the space of five overs though, swinging momentum back towards the hosts.

Wicket-keeper Matthew Cross chipped in with 47, but Scotland fell 19 runs short, leaving them with seven wins from 14 matches, while the Netherlands top the table with 11 wins from 18. 

The Scots face the UAE on Wednesday, before taking on the Dutch again on Friday.

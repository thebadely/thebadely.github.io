Scorecard

Sam Curran salvaged England's innings before the first match of their winter travels was washed out by rain in Christchurch.

Harry Brook's side battled canny bowling and a tricky pitch to post 153-6 in the opening T20, but the weather denied New Zealand the chance to start their chase, resulting in a frustrating start to a low-profile white-ball series.

This contest comes little more than a month before the highly anticipated Ashes tour, and England named three of their squad to face Australia in the XI at the Hagley Oval.

It was one of those not included who was most effective, however, as all-rounder Curran hit 49 not out from 35 balls to lift England from 81-5.

Jos Buttler, potential Test number three Jacob Bethell and Brook made starts, before Curran survived being dropped twice and overturned an lbw dismissal to drag England to a score that may well have been competitive.

The second T20 is at the Hagley Oval on Monday, starting at 07:15 BST, before the third match in Auckland on Thursday.

Three one-day internationals follow, when Joe Root, Ben Duckett and Jofra Archer are among the other Test players who will join the touring party.

Most eyes are, understandably, on the Ashes rather than this series.

It should not be forgotten, however, that this was the first of only six T20s England have before the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka begins in February.

While Bethell, who flickered in striking a fine straight six before falling to a top edge for 15, can press their case to play against Australia, Curran is one of those with the most to gain before the World Cup.

The 27-year-old was picked for the first time in any format under coach Brendon McCullum last month and offers a second seam-bowling option in the batting-heavy side Brook's England favour. He was told by the England hierarchy earning a place as an all-rounder who could bat in the top six was his route back into the side, rather than as a bowler.

Having seen Bethell, Buttler, who made 29, Jordan Cox and Tom Banton tamely chip catches into the air on a surface that nipped for the quick bowlers and held for the spinners, Curran was fortunate to be dropped on 14 by bowler Jacob Duffy and at deep extra cover by Tim Robinson when he had 26. Both were straightforward chances.

While at no point did he find his best batting rhythm, Curran remained calm to power the impressive left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner for one six over long-off and flicked a full toss over square leg in a final over from which he took seamer Duffy for 19.

This match will not last long in the memory, but Curran at least took advantage of what limited opportunity he was given.

"Baz [McCullum] gave him a very honest reason for why he wasn't selected in the first place," Brook said. 

"He went back, practised hard and he's put out those performances and done really well in the last year and a half.

"Everybody in world cricket knows he's done it pretty much everywhere. He's a very valuable player to have in the middle order, a left-hander as well. He's going to be around for a while, I think. It's good to have him back."

England captain Harry Brook: "The pitch did a little bit to start with. Matt Henry, especially, made the most of the surface.

"We obviously want to adapt to the situation and the surface but, with the depth of batting we've got, we can go hard all the way through."

New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: "The boys started extremely well with the new ball. It was a pretty good performance. 

"It was doing a bit today and it was handy to chuck the ball around. It's nice when you can throw the ball to someone and they are able to respond."

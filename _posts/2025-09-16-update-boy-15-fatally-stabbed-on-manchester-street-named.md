Let's dive into the details: The parents of a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death have said they will "not allow his name to be known as yet another statistic in the rise of knife crime".

Mohanad Abdullaahi Goobe died of his injuries after he was stabbed on Moston Street, Manchester, on Monday afternoon.

In a tribute his family said: "Mohanad was the baby of the family, he was quick to laugh, easy to love, with a ready smile".

Another 15-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody after the stabbing, Greater Manchester Police said.

In a statement, Mohanad's family said: "His life has been cut tragically short, it is difficult to comprehend that seeing your son head off for school in the morning would be the last time that we would see that handsome face." 

They said the 15-year-old had "an uncanny ability to make you laugh, making it sometimes difficult to be serious with him".

He also had an older sister and brother, they said.

"Mohanad had many friends, he was loyal and often played the class clown, simply to see them laugh," the family added.

"Mohanad deserves to be remembered for the young man who was loved by his family, and loved big in return, not as the boy whose life was taken with no thought or reason."

Police are continuing to investigate the stabbing and have urged anyone with information about the attack to come forward.

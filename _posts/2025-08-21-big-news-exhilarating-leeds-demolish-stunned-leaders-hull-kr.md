Leeds Rhinos produced a scintillating performance to sweep aside Super League leaders Hull KR and turbocharge their push for second place.

The rampant Rhinos cracked open the meanest defence in the competition with some superb play at Headingley.

Hull KR had only conceded 37 tries in 22 rounds heading into the game, but Leeds ran in four in a terrific display.

Three came before the break from Jake Connor, Presley Cassell and Lachie Miller before Harry Newman added another in the second half.

The statement win took Brad Arthur's side level on points with second-placed Wigan Warriors, who face Wakefield Trinity on Sunday.

It was a chastening evening for the Challenge Cup holders, who found Leeds simply too hot to handle.

They were not helped by first-half injuries to forwards Sauaso Sue and Jai Whitbread, which took them out of the contest and, in the case of Sue in particular, looks serious enough to threaten his involvement in the run-in.

Already without the suspended Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, Hull KR were on the back foot from the start with Leeds drawing first blood in the 13th minute through Connor, who landed six out of six with the boot.

There did not look to be much on when he took the ball in the middle of the field, but a fend on Whitbread created the space and the Leeds half-back had the pace to go over.

Four minutes later, teenage front-row Cassell struck for his side's second try, collecting Kallum Watkins' chip kick, which cannoned off the post.

It was the outstanding young prospect's second try in two games.

Things went from bad to worse for the Robins when Miller went over for the home side's third try in the 26th minute. It was a beauty too, with the lightning full-back gliding through a hole as the home side spread the ball, and then stepping off his right foot for his ninth Super League try of the season.

Leeds led a stunned Hull KR 18-0 at the break.

The visitors came out strongly after the break, but winger Joe Burgess was thwarted by a terrific last-ditch tackle from Newman. Then Mikey Lewis, who endured an uncharacteristically error-ridden evening, was held up over the line.

Hull KR claimed a try on the hour as Newman, under pressure for a kick from Jack Broadbent, spilled the ball behind his own line, but referee Jack Smith adjudged he was tackled in the air.

Brodie Croft put Newman in for Leeds's fourth try with ten minutes left, leaving Tom Davies's 100th Super League try late as mere consolation.

While the defeat will almost certainly only delay Hull KR's crowning as League Leaders' Shield winners, Leeds have put themselves right into the race for second place that brings with it a home semi-final.

The only blot on the evening for Leeds was the loss of captain Ash Handley in the second half to a groin injury.

Leeds Rhinos head coach Brad Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds: 

"After winning last week 60-odd with a really good clinical performance, the hard thing is to do it the next week against the best team in the comp.

"I'm pretty happy for the boys. They've worked hard. I feel like it has been building towards that.

"They're a good side. How you keep them to nil I don't know, but we came close.

"We've still got a bit of work to do, but in the back of our heads we're desperate to get a home [play-off] final."

[On full-back Lachie Miller] "There's some things at times where you don't see it but you've just got to let him go, because he's so dangerous.

"I feel the thing he's really improved is that those brain snaps are few and far between. He's such a competitor and he wants to win. If he can stay in control of his emotions, he's a very good player."

Hull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside: 

"It wasn't a good performance and, obviously, result. We didn't start how we planned to.

"We didn't attack well and we didn't defend well. We need to be honest about why we performed that way.

"Credit to Leeds, I thought they were very good. Leeds are definitely a team that will be there at the back end of the year."

[On the injury to Sauaso Sue] "It's a knee. It doesn't sound good at the moment, so we'll have to see how the scan goes.

"We're fearing the worst, but we're hoping it's going to be better for us because he adds so much to our team, and we certainly missed him tonight when he went off.

"We had Jai [Whitbread] go off as well, so it hurt. Naturally, it does if your two front rowers don't play a large part of the game - but I don't think we had control of that game tonight."

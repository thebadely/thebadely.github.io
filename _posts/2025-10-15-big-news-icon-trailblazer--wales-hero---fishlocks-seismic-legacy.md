Let's dive into the details: Midfielder Jess Fishlock is the most capped Wales international of all time

Jess Fishlock's Wales chapter is poised to come to an end following a glorious international career that has boasted 165 caps and 48 goals.

She will make her 166th and final appearance for her country when Rhian Wilkinson's side host Australia at Cardiff City Stadium on 25 October.

The 38-year-old Fishlock was a monumental figure in the growth of a side that played in a major tournament for the first time in their history earlier in 2025.

The record goalscorer then netted the first ever goal for the women's side on the grandest stage, although her remarkable impact went way beyond her on-pitch exploits.

From the word go, there was always something special about Fishlock.

She started her playing career with hometown club Cardiff City Ladies, now Gwalia United, and swiftly caught the eye - making her first-team debut at 15.

Having captained Wales Under-19s, Fishlock earned her senior bow against Switzerland - a nation where almost two decades later the final touch of gloss would be dabbed on what was to be a glittering career - in 2006.

Only two years later, Fishlock made the decision to join Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and became the first overseas player in the Eredivisie.

Her boldness typified that of a woman who was as relentless as she was ambitious from the very beginning of her time as a footballer.

Despite some struggles in the Netherlands, Fishlock was part of a side that claimed back-to-back Eredivisie titles, and it was a sign of things to come at club level. 

Upon returning to Bristol, she was named Women's Super League (WSL) Players' Player of the Season in her second campaign and enjoyed even more success in Australia soon after.

Having joined Melbourne Victory, Fishlock starred as the Victoria-based side reached two Grand Finals - winning their first title in 2013.

An eye-catching move to Seattle Reign in 2013 proved to be the catalyst in making Fishlock a star on the global stage.

She has helped the club win three NWSL Shield titles, and even during her loan stints away from the American side, of which there have been six in total, success still followed.

Indeed, the midfielder tasted further league glory with Glasgow, Melbourne City, Frankfurt and Lyon - winning the Champions League with each of the latter two sides.

But the glut of honours were never replicated on the international stage.

Fishlock wasted no time in becoming a key cog under Andy Beattie, Adrian Tucker, Jarmo Matikainen, Jayne Ludlow, Gemma Grainger and most recently Wilkinson.

Though for all of her mesmerising showings, goals, assists and endeavour, tournament qualification proved one hurdle too many with Wales for the majority of her career. Although, thankfully, not for all of it.

'She's the best player in the world'

The date 3 December 2024 will be forever etched into Wales history.

Following a 1-1 draw between the sides in Cardiff four days earlier, goals from Hannah Cain and Carrie Jones earned Rhian Wilkinson's side a 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin to ensure Wales would at long last break their tournament duck.

It was the pinnacle for a team who had seen icons including Laura McAllister, Jayne Ludlow and Helen Ward - and Neville Southall, Ryan Giggs, Ian Rush and Mark Hughes to name a few on the men's side - all fail to achieve their tournament dream with Wales.

On the eve of the 2025 Euros, Fishlock told BBC Sport Wales: "A big narrative around my entire career internationally has been, 'Can I get to a major tournament?' and 'Can we get to a major tournament?' We've been so close so many times.

"When you want to achieve something and you get to do it with some of your very closest friends, there's really no comparison to that feeling."

Even in the aftermath of their humbling 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands in their competition opener in Switzerland, Fishlock was intent on ensuring further progress was the target.

"This is the level now, right?" she said. "We've got to get used to this real fast."

Not content with adding one more piece of history to her ever-increasing list of achievements, Fishlock again took centre stage as she netted a 13th-minute equaliser in Wales' second group stage match against France in St Gallen - the first  goal the women's side had scored in a major tournament.

Aged 38 years and 176 days, the strike made Fishlock the oldest scorer in women's Euro finals history.

It was as fitting as it was deserved, given the weight of expectation she had carried on her shoulders for the vast majority of her time in the red of Wales. 

It also demonstrated there was immense quality to go with her commendable longevity - with Fishlock playing in 67% of the 245 international matches ever played by the Welsh women's side.

Recent Welsh success has brought with it increased expectation and stronger opposition - with Wales' nine-game winless run across their Euro and Nations League A fixtures in 2025 serving as proof that they are now on a whole new level when it comes to competing with the world's big guns.

But Fishlock simply would not have it any other way.

Fishlock has never shied away from using her profile to speak out on her beliefs having come out as gay.

In 2018, Fishlock - who married former team-mate Tziarra King in 2023 - was awarded an MBE for services to women's football and the LGBT community.

Before the men's World Cup in Qatar, Fishlock opened up on the importance of visibility amid concerns over the 2022 tournament host nation's record on gay rights.

It came after she had described her experience at school as "hell on earth" because of abuse she received over her sexuality.

Nevertheless, Fishlock remained determined to use her platform to help educate others.

Speaking in 2019, Fishlock said: "I'm not the only one that gets abused. I am not the only one that gets comments thrown at them. 

"It's come round to my family and my sisters and my mum and my dad, so when I made that decision, you know I have to think about other people as well otherwise it's very selfish of me.

"But there really is a big picture, and the bigger picture is generations of kids looking at a role model, looking at what they've achieved and understanding whatever they are going through."

Following the friendly between Wales and the United States of America in July 2023, Fishlock embraced USA icon and Seattle Reign team-mate Megan Rapinoe - who is also openly gay.

The pair wore each other's national team shirt and posed for photographs - making sure their support for LGBT rights was front and centre of the pictures' message.

Such has been Fishlock's impact on the game itself, a mural covering the playing area of a five-a-side football pitch in Splott, Cardiff, was unveiled in June to celebrate her impact on football, equality and representation.

The Red Wall will get the chance to celebrate Fishlock's efforts when Wales host Australia and Poland in friendlies later this month.

One thing is for certain, the void left by Fishlock is unlikely ever to be filled, or her achievements surpassed.

But Wales are unquestionably in a far better place thanks to the truly astonishing efforts of a player who gave her all, and more, to ensure she leaves behind a legacy like no other.

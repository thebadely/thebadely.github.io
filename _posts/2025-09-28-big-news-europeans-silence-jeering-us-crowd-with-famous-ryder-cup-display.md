According to new developments, Childhood friends McIlroy and Lowry won both of their matches in Saturday's pairings at Bethpage 

Finally, after a frenetic afternoon in a febrile New York, Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry felt the love as they celebrated earning a point which edged Europe closer to a seismic Ryder Cup away win.

And it was down to the pair largely keeping calm in the face of American abuse, rarely rising to the bait and, ultimately, letting their golf do the talking.

McIlroy and Lowry received crude barbs at Bethpage - related to romantic relationships and their appearance - as well as the home fans ignoring golfing etiquette by shouting out as they were about to hit their ball.

Lowry had to be restrained from confronting a fan on the 10th tee. McIlroy, who was forced to back away from shots, described the whole experience as a "really challenging day".

"What I consider crossing the line is personal insults and making sounds when they are trying to hit on their backswings or very close to when they are trying to go into their routines," said European captain Luke Donald.

"That did happen a little bit. It's happened at other Ryder Cups.

"It's something we prepared for and I can see how well [McIlroy and Lowry] have dealt with it."

The tension spilled over elsewhere, too.

Justin Rose was unhappy that Bryson DeChambeauâs caddie strayed too close when he was ready to putt on the 15th green - another no-no in golfing circles - leading to an exchange of words which also involved Rose's playing partner Tommy Fleetwood and his and Scottie Scheffler's caddies.

"I asked him to move. Maybe not as politely as I could have done but in the scenario, coming down the stretch, it's intense out there," said Rose, who regretted the incident might detract from a fabulous match that they won 3&2.

"If I should have done it a different way, I apologise."

In the face of adversity, close friends McIlroy and Lowry tamed the Bethpage bear pit with a vital fourballs win, setting Europe on the path to a commanding 11Â½-4Â½ lead going into Sunday's 12 singles - 14Â½ is the magic number for victory.

Sealing victory on the 18th green allowed the pair to finally cut loose emotionally, grabbing each other tightly in a vice-like grip before demonstratively expressing their delight.

Instead of hostility, they could only hear the sound of European fans sweetly serenading them.

"We knew what we were going to get coming here," said Lowry.

"It was a very tough day. Being out with Rory doesn't make it any easier. I think he's getting the brunt of it.

"But, look, we dealt with it very well."

The continued abuse overshadowed one of Europe's most outstanding days on American soil as they moved within three points of a first away victory since 2012.

There were a number of unsavoury exchanges with world number two McIlroy receiving the majority of the stick.

It started early from an unexpected source. A Bethpage MC joined in with an expletive-led abusive chant about the 36-year-old from Northern Ireland as she warmed up the crowd before the opening tee-shot at 7:10am local time.

McIlroy grinned as he was told where to go by hundreds of home fans, blowing them kisses in response.

Heather McMahan later apologised to McIlroy but she will no longer perform her duties on the final day.

In a statement released to BBC Sport, the PGA of America said: "Heather has extended an apology to Rory Mcllroy and Ryder Cup Europe and has stepped down from hosting the first tee of the Ryder Cup."

'Give us respect' - McIlroy swears at fans amid jeering

But the exchange set the tone of the day. McIlroy lost his cool towards the end of his morning foursomes win alongside Lowry, swearing at American fans during a heated moment on the 16th fairway.

With some members of the crowd fuelled by all-day drinking, things became reached boiling point in the afternoon fourballs.

The atmosphere simmered over the opening few holes before becoming a tinderbox on the par-five fourth green.

McIlroy backed off a putt for an eagle three after a shout disrupted his concentration. He missed his effort but Lowry holed his chance - and then erupted with a passionate and pointed celebration towards the offender.

When Lowry stuck away another putt for a birdie on the fifth, he let rip with another vocal celebration. Only his dad Brendan, watching from the side, shouted louder.

Things ignited again on the sixth green when McIlroy backed off another putt. "Can't take it, Rory?'" bawled one New Yorker.

A crowd in a city known for its brash and harsh sports fans clearly felt this was all fair game.

By this stage, the exasperated European pair - as well as vice-captain Eduardo Molinari - were pointing out hecklers to the police officers, who had visibly moved in tighter in a bid to calm the mood.

American opponents Justin Thomas and Cameron Young sensibly appealed for calm, but also stoked emotions with wild celebrations when they won holes seven and nine to leave a tense match all square again.

The PGA of America, who organise the Ryder Cup, beefed up security around all four matches and the sight of police officers trailing the players was a clear warning sign of the threat they faced.

Messages warning fans of a zero tolerance approach to abusive shouting flashed up on huge screens across the course, saying they would "continue to closely monitor fan behaviour and take appropriate action".

Shortly after Lowry lunged towards the fan on the 10th tee, one of these reminders  was booed by the American fans around the 11th green.

At this point, an attritional match - which had quality but saw more grind - remained deadlocked.

Finally McIlroy landed a hot putt on the 14th, earning a birdie which put Europe into a lead they would not relinquish.

By the time they had navigated themselves to the 18th, thicker clouds gathered over Bethpage. The metaphor was clear.

Moods darkened to the point where a fist fight broke out between two spectators in the grandstand behind the final green.

Police quickly moved in and kicked out the offenders. Officers told BBC Sport that no arrests had been made over the course of a fiery day.

"I'm going to sleep well tonight," said McIlroy on the 18th green.

With Bethpage Black turning to Bethpage Blue, Sunday could be a mercifully short day for the Europeans.

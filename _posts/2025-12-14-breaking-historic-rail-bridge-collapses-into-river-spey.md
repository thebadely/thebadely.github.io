Here’s what you need to know: A historic former railway bridge has been cordoned off by police after a section of it collapsed into the River Spey in Moray.

The Spey Viaduct, an iron girder structure near Garmouth, was completed in 1886 and while no longer used for trains, was popular with cyclists and walkers.

Images on social media showed one of its supporting stone piers was leaning at an angle and part of the metalwork had twisted and fallen into the river. 

Local SNP MSP Richard Lochhead said people in the area would be devastated and questioned whether the structure has been adequately maintained. 

He said: "The local community will be heartbroken by the collapse of the much-loved Spey viaduct, which is not only an iconic structure but also incredibly popular with walkers, cyclists, and tourists.

"I'm now in touch with Moray Council seeking answers around when and by whom the structure was last checked, and what happens next with regards to the future of the bridge."

The bridge spans 350ft (107m) over the River Spey, regarded as the fastest flowing river in Scotland

The railway line closed in the 1960s but the bridge, also known as the Garmouth Viaduct, was later paved. 

The Speyside Way, a long-distance trail which traces the River Spey from the Moray Firth to the Cairngorms National Park, passes the east end of the bridge.

It is also part of the National Cycle Network.

Moray Council, which manages the trail, said the bridge would remain closed until further notice.

A council statement said: "Our engineers are aware and will assess the situation before further detail can be provided.

"Members of the public and media are asked to keep their distance from the rest of the bridge structure.

"Do not pass the police cordon in place and do not climb on any part of the bridge - thank you for your co-operation."

Local councillor Shona Morrison said she was "incredibly saddened by the news". 

"The viaduct holds such a special place in my family's heart,  it is devastating to see the collapse of such a well-loved and iconic landmark."

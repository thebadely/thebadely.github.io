It has been recently reported that Friday's summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin features on many front pages. The Guardian, the i Paper and the Financial Times all focus on the US president threatening Russia with "severe consequences" if the Russian president rejects a ceasefire with Ukraine. The Times says it has learned that Russia and the US have considered a model for ending the conflict which mirrors Israel's occupation of the West Bank â€“ with Moscow taking control of occupied Ukraine via a governing body. The White House tells the paper that no such discussion has taken place.

The Daily Telegraph claims that Trump will arrive at the summit armed with a series of money-making proposals for Putin, as incentives to end the war. These are said to include offering Russia access to rare earth minerals in the Ukrainian territories it occupies - and opening up Alaska's natural resources to Moscow. US officials are quoted as saying they do not comment on conversations that may or may not be happening.

The Daily Mail reports that BBC bosses have apologised in what the paper calls an "embarrassing climbdown" after the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, was called xenophobic by a Thought for The Day contributor on the Radio 4 Today programme. It says Dr Krish Kandiah "prompted fury" with his comments, leaving Jenrick to describe the incident as "extremely disappointing".

Comments by the policing minister Dame Diana Johnson advising shops not to keep expensive items near entrances to deter thieves are highlighted by the Daily Express, which says they've been branded a "disgrace" and "staggering" by the Conservatives. The paper notes that the boss of Iceland, Richard Walker, had warned that levels of shoplifting were getting worse, and says Dame Diana responded by agreeing that he had a point, and emphasised the government's investment in neighbourhood policing.

Ministers are considering scrapping a commitment to spend 80% of foreign aid on projects that support gender equality, according to the Guardian. It says critics have warned the move could worsen the impact of Donald Trump's rollback of funding for diversity. The Foreign Office says it will continue to champion the rights of women and girls globally.

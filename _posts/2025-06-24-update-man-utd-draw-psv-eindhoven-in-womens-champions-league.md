Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Manchester United finished third in the WSL last season

Manchester United will play Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the second round of qualification for the Women's Champions League.

The second round of qualification takes place as a mini tournament, with the semi-final on 27 August and the final and third place play-off on 30 August.

United, who finished third in the Women's Super League last season, are in Group 1, and will play PSV before the winner takes on one of Swedish side Hammarby or Metalist Kharkiv from Ukraine.

Should they get through the second round, the third round of qualification stage begins in September with a two-legged play-off tie against one opponent for a place in the league phase.

Glasgow City are also in the second round and the Scottish side will play Austria's FK Austria Wien in their first match, with the winner taking on Bulgarian side FC Minsk.

Welsh double winners Cardiff City will take on Republic of Ireland club Athlone Town in the first qualifying round with the winners facing Croatian champions ZNK Agram in the group final for a place in the second round of qualifying.

Also in the first round, Northern Ireland's Cliftonville Ladies will take on KFF Mitrovica, the champions of Kosovo.

Let's dive into the details: Paddy Pimblett is on a seven-fight winning streak in the UFC

Paddy Pimblett dropped nearly three stone in weight before his victory against Michael Chandler at UFC 314 last month.

The 30-year-old produced a brilliant performance to stop the UFC veteran for the biggest win of his career to date.

The Liverpudlian is known to balloon in weight between fights and released on his YouTube channel, external that he dropped 40lb - 2st 12lb - in the weeks leading up UFC 314 in order to reach the lightweight limit of 156lb (11st 2lb).

Pimblett weighed 190lb seven weeks prior to the fight when he began to slim down through careful dieting and daily training.

"Been heavier to start with," Pimblett said. "Been eating 2,000 calories a day."

Following a week of training, a frustrated Pimblett said his weight was "doing his head in" as he had only managed to lose three pounds.

However he was 175lb (12st 7lb) before fight week in Miami and 170lbs (12st 2lb) two days before the weigh-in.

All UFC fighters weigh in on the morning of the day before fight night, prior to a ceremonial weigh-in later that evening.

Pimblett dropped 13lb during his weight cut and was 157lb (11st 3lb) the night before.

"That was one of my easiest weight cuts," Pimblett said.

The UFC recommends a fighter can safely cut between 8% and 10% of their body weight in the days before they hit the scales.

Pimblett was above that threshold, but said being 170lb in fight week was generally his target number to achieve a straightforward weight cut.

His win against Chandler extended his unbeaten streak in the UFC to seven and his overall record to 23 wins and just three losses.

Pimblett then puts back on the weight he cut in the hours after the weigh-in and before fight night

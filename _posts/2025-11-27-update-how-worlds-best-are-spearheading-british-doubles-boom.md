Here’s what you need to know: Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool won seven titles together in 2025

There is only one thing Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have not been able to align on this year.

In their first full season together, the British duo have claimed the Wimbledon men's doubles title and secured the year-end world number one ranking.

Their post-season diaries, however, are another matter.

Glasspool will be marking their triumphant season with dinner at a swanky London restaurant with family, team members and sponsors.

But, thanks to a pre-booked holiday in Tenerife, Cash will be forced to miss out.

"Everyone will be there - apart from Jules. He'll be on a boozy lads' trip," Glasspool joked.

"There will be a few beers, but it's mostly golf and padel. We will both be celebrating - just separately," Cash laughed.

The easy-going exchange demonstrates the camaraderie that has helped 29-year-old Cash and Glasspool, 32, become the best men's team in the world.

Their rise has also helped secure Britain's place as the leading force in men's doubles.

There are five British players ranked inside the world's top 10. All of them reached the last four of the season-ending ATP Finals, with Cash and Glasspool losing to eventual runners-up Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.

Britain's Henry Patten went on to triumph in Turin alongside Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara.

All five have Grand Slam titles to their names and at least one of them has won a major in each of the past six seasons.

"We have created an amazing culture - we all train together and have a great atmosphere when we're on tour," Cash said.

"It shows we can succeed as a group."

The success has reiterated how distinguished doubles guru Louis Cayer has transformed the nation's quality and depth through his work at the Lawn Tennis Association.

Cayer began coaching in Montreal parks before rising to become Canada's Davis Cup captain.

It was Judy Murray who contacted him in the mid-2000s, asking him to help improve her eldest son Jamie's game.

Armed with video clips, stats and an eye for detail, Cayer elevated the Scot's game - leading to two Grand Slam men's doubles titles and the world number one ranking in 2016.

Cash and Glasspool are the latest beneficiaries of the programme implemented by Cayer, a maverick-like character who Glasspool describes as an "interesting personality", "straight-talking" and a "gentleman".

The pair pick out four key elements of Cayer's philosophy: instilling discipline, "black and white" communication, settling them mentally in new situations and providing astute video analysis to be relayed through their coaches.

"We often describe it as the best doubles programme globally," Leon Smith, Britain's Davis Cup captain, said.

"It is unique and it is one of the most successful programmes, I think, that we as a governing body have delivered. 

"The players have had direction from arguably the best doubles coach that has ever been around globally."

Linking up midway through 2024 was a case of "right place, right time" for Cash and Glasspool.

The early part of this season brought titles in Brisbane and Doha, before they became the first all-British team in the Open era to lift the Queen's trophy in June.

Three weeks later, they made more history by becoming the first British duo in 89 years to win the Wimbledon men's doubles.

"I've always believed we're good enough to win big tournaments but until you do, you're not good enough to win them, essentially," Glasspool said.

"When we won Queen's - a stacked draw with all the top players and the level as good as a Slam - we realised we can get over the line in the big moments against the big teams.

"That gave us the belief we could go on and do it at other tournaments like Wimbledon."

Glasspool and Cash have earned about Â£1.7m each in prize money this year, including Â£340,000 apiece from their maiden Grand Slam title at Wimbledon

Winning a Grand Slam was one of their shared goals for 2025. The other was securing a spot at the ATP Finals.

Cash and Glasspool qualified well before winning a seventh and final title of the season in Vienna and an outstanding year was capped by finishing top of the rankings.

A thorough reflection on the greatest spell of their careers will, however, have to wait.

Given the intensity of the tennis schedule. the pair want to switch off mentally - with the celebratory dinner and winter-sun trip helping.

Preparations for next season will begin in early December at the National Tennis Centre.

"Right now, it is important that we stop," added Cash, who only started playing doubles full time in 2022.

"It is better we shut it down and don't think about the tennis too much. 

"When we get back to to it, a big part of the reflection is sitting down and setting goals for next year."

Experts revealed that Jon Rahm won LIV Golf's individual and team titles in 2025

LIV Golf events will be extended to 72 holes from 2026, putting them in line with the sport's established tours.

The Saudi Arabia-backed circuit was launched in 2022 with 54-hole events and even takes its name from the Roman numeral for 54 - LIV.

The unconventional format played a role in players being denied official ranking points, with most LIV events having been played from Friday to Sunday.

They will now be contested from Thursday of tournament weeks - apart from a Wednesday start for February's LIV Golf Riyadh.

Two-time major winner Jon Rahm, who won his second straight LIV title in August, said that "this is a win for the league, and the players". 

"LIV Golf is a player's league," said the former world number one. "We are competitors to the core and we want every opportunity to compete at the highest level and to perfect our craft.

"Moving to 72 holes is the logical next step that strengthens the competition, tests us more fully, and, if the growing galleries from last season are any indication, delivers more of what the fans want."

Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) points play a key role in determining entry into golf's four majors.

LIV Golf players have slid down the rankings with Rahm now 71st in the world while Dustin Johnson, another former world number one, is 604th.

"Playing 72 holes just feels a little more like the big tournaments we've all grown up playing," said Johnson. "I've always liked the grind of four rounds."

Bryson DeChambeau, who is also on the LIV tour, added: "Everyone wants to see the best players in the world competing against each other, especially in the majors, and for the good of the game, we need a path forward."

For each regular season event, the individual competition will be decided over 72 holes of stroke play.

The team competition will continue to run concurrently, with each team's cumulative individual stroke play scores determining the team result.

"The move to 72 holes marks a pivotal new chapter for LIV Golf that strengthens our league, challenges our elite field of players, and delivers more of the world-class golf, energy, innovation and access that our global audience wants," said LIV Golf chief executive Scott O'Neil.

"The most successfulâ¯leagues around the world - IPL, EPL, NBA, MLB, NFL - continue to innovate and evolve their product, and as an emerging league, we are no different."

This is a major change for LIV and the most significant move since Scott O'Neil replaced Greg Norman as the breakaway tour's chief executive last year.

It is a voluntary rejection of one of the fundamental points of difference between LIV and the established professional tours.

Adding an extra round clearly pleases their players, several of whom have campaigned for this switch. In his first LIV season, Jon Rahm told BBC Sport that he would like to see the format increase from three to four rounds.

At the time, Rahm argued that such an alteration would help the game unify. But there still seems little chance of it leading to a coming together between the Saudi funded circuit and the PGA Tour.

The move could help LIV's quest for recognition by the official golf rankings, but the OWGR is still likely to have concerns over the league's team format potentially compromising individual performances.

This was a major sticking point when LIV's initial bid for recognition was rejected.  LIV also announced this week an expanded pathway for players to qualify for their tour, which is another move that could help them gain world ranking recognition.

It is also worth noting that many, not all, of LIV's biggest stars have struggled in majors. Returning to a regular diet of 72-hole competition might result in them becoming better prepared for the big four tournaments that remain the most important in the game.

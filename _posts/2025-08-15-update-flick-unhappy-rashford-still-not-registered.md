It has been recently reported that Marcus Rashford played in a friendly for Barcelona against Como last weekend

Marcus Rashford has still not been registered by new club Barcelona, with manager Hansi Flick saying he is "not happy" about the situation.

The Spanish champions' season begins on Saturday, but they are struggling to sign players because of La Liga's financial rules.

In the 2024-25 season, Barca spent more on buying players and on wages than they made in revenue.

"For me, the situation, you can imagine I'm not happy about that. But I know the situation and I believe in the club," Flick told a news conference on Friday.

"We will focus on what we can change and what is in our hands. The other things, I believe in the club."

Will Barcelona be able to register Rashford?

Chaos & controversy - Rashford's first two weeks inside Barca soap opera

Barcelona's finances have proved an issue in recent years, with them only being able to register Dani Olmo for the first half of the 2024-25 season as a special exception.

They then had two appeals rejected in their attempt to register him for the rest of the season. The club were allowed to re-register him temporarily in January 2025, and that was extended to the end of the season in April.

In 2022, they only managed to register four signings - including striker Robert Lewandowski - shortly before their opening fixture after freeing up funding with with several 'economic levers'.

This season, they have managed to partially help their registration headache by getting German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to agree to a long-term medical leave agreement, freeing up 80% of his wage value to register a replacement.

The departure of 34-year-old defender Inigo Martinez to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr has also freed up salary space.

Defender Joao Garcia is also yet to be registered.

Barcelona's first game of the season takes place at Mallorca on Saturday (18:30 BST).

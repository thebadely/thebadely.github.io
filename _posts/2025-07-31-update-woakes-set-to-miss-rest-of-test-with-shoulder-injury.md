Woakes injures shoulder after making dive at long-off boundary

England pace bowler Chris Woakes looks likely to be ruled out of the remainder of the decisive fifth Test against India after suffering a shoulder injury on the opening day at The Oval.

Woakes was tumbling to make a boundary stop late on Thursday when he landed awkwardly. He went from the field with his left arm in a makeshift sling, in obvious discomfort.

The Warwickshire man is likely to have a scan overnight and England will provide an update on Friday.

"It doesn't look great," fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson told BBC Sport. "I will be surprised if he takes any part in the game."

Atkinson added: "It's the last game of the series and when anyone gets injured it's a shame. We're hoping it's not too bad. Whatever it is, he will get full support from everyone."

Woakes was still at the ground after India closed Thursday on 204-6, undergoing treatment and assessment from the England medical staff.

It is cruel on Woakes, the only England pace bowler to have featured in every Test of the gruelling five-match series.

On flat pitches in the previous four Tests, he struggled to make a impact, taking 10 wickets. On day one at The Oval, Woakes had India opener KL Rahul play on to his stumps before suffering the injury.

Given his poor record away from home, Woakes was already facing a battle to be part of England's squad for the Ashes tour this winter. At 36, there will be concerns this injury threatens his future in international cricket.

Woakes' injury is also a huge blow to an England pace attack already depleted by injuries and exhaustion.

Captain Ben Stokes, England's leading wicket-taker in this series, is missing the final Test with a shoulder injury, while Mark Wood is a long-term absentee. Olly Stone is only just returning to fitness following a knee injury.

Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer were both left out at The Oval following their previous workload in this series.

'It looked serious' - Cook reacts to Woakes' injury

With the centrally-contracted Matthew Potts overlooked for the entire Test summer and Sam Cook not featuring again after making his debut against Zimbabwe in May, England's bowling unit already had a makeshift look even before the Woakes injury.

Atkinson is playing his first senior professional cricket in more than two months following a hamstring injury, Josh Tongue is back in the side after being overlooked for the previous two Tests and Jamie Overton is winning his second Test cap more than three years on from his first.

It meant England were often erratic in helpful conditions on the first day at The Oval. They conceded 30 runs in extras, while an unbeaten 52 from Karun Nair kept India in a healthy position.

If Woakes is ruled out for the remainder of the Test, England will have to rely on the other three seamers, plus the spin of Jacob Bethell and Joe Root.

Atkinson was the pick of the bowlers with 2-31 and said his enforced injury absence will provide a freshness that can cover for Woakes' absence.

"I feel fresh, I feel good," said Atkinson. "I know I've only got this one game to play so I can push the limits a bit."

Despite a mixed performance with the ball, England reduced India to 153-6, only for an unbroken stand of 51 between Nair and Washington Sundar to leave honours even.

"You look at the pitch and overheads and think it should be easy for the bowlers, but I think it's a ground where if you don't bowl well you can go for runs quite easily," said Atkinson.

"It will be interesting tomorrow. If we can pick up some early wickets, we'll get an opportunity to hopefully keep them down to 230 or 240."

Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played

Belgium given penalty against Wales after VAR check

Wales were left flabbergasted as referee Daniel Siebert pointed to the spot to give Belgium the opportunity to equalise in the World Cup qualifier between the sides.

Joe Rodon's early header was the reward for Wales' fine start at Cardiff City Stadium, although Ethan Ampadu was penalised for a handball 10 minutes later and Kevin De Bruyne netted the resulting penalty to kickstart the Red Devils' comeback.

It proved a turning point in the match and a major talking point in the aftermath as Wales' World Cup qualifying destiny fell out of their own hands.

"We were on top and that decision changed the game," said Harry Wilson.

In his role as match summariser for BBC Radio 5 Live, former Wales midfielder David Edwards said of the penalty: "There's nothing Ethan Ampadu can do about that. He's only a yard away as it's flicked up at his forearm.

"It can never be a penalty when it's that close, surely?"

After the spot-kick was awarded, Edwards labelled it an "outrageous decision".

But 16-cap defender Tom Lockyer felt Wales were in trouble as soon as Video Assistant Referee (VAR) Pascal MÃ¼ller urged referee Siebert to review the incident on a monitor.

"The longer it went on, he (Siebert) had one look at it and made his mind up straight away," said Lockyer.

"These European referees don't mess around when it comes to handball, they are a lot stricter than we are in the UK."

Former Wales player and assistant manager Kit Symons feels stricter interpretation in European competition could see attacking players intentionally seek to play the ball against the arms of defenders.

"In European international football you know it's going to get given," he told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast.

"The handball rule is one that really bugs people and the referees don't particularly like it either, I know that.

"[Charles] De Ketelaere flicked it up against his (Ampadu's) hand. Forwards now look to do that, it's clever play from forwards if you like.

"Intentional is one of the criteria, there was no intent in it whatsoever, and it was in very close proximity.

"A couple of the criteria are not really ticking the box, but his arm was out a little bit and it was going towards goal and all these sort of things. It's unfortunate but you knew it was going to get given I'm afraid."

Wales have lost four of their past five matches having gone unbeaten in their opening nine games under Craig Bellamy

After equalising, Belgium wasted no time in stamping their authority on proceedings as Thomas Meunier gave them a 2-1 lead.

Following a Jordan James handball, De Bruyne struck a second penalty on 76 minutes to put the away side in command.

Nathan Broadhead gave Wales late hope with his third international goal, although Leandro Trossard bagged Belgium's fourth a minute later to seal victory for the visitors.

Former Wales international Kath Morgan felt Rudi Garcia's side were more than worthy winners, regardless of the game's first penalty decision.

"We can argue all day about whether it was a penalty or not," she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.

"Ultimately, it's hit his hand. Was it in an unnatural position? You could argue both ways.

"It's unfortunate, but could we come back? We couldn't. We had no answer, Belgium were just so clinical."

22 March, Wales 3-1 Liechtenstein - Connor Roberts handball, penalty scored by Askhat Tagybergen

9 June, Belgium 4-3 Wales - Brennan Johnson handball, penalty scored by Romelu Lukaku

13 October, Wales 2-4 Belgium - Ethan Ampadu handball, penalty scored by Kevin De Bruyne

13 October, Wales 2-4 Belgium - Jordan James handball, penalty scored by Kevin De Bruyne

It prompted Wales boss Craig Bellamy to question differences in the interpretation of the handball rule across varying competitions.

"The second one (penalty), I have no complaints with. But the first one, it's like, what are we supposed to do with our hands?" he said.

"I just don't know what we're supposed to do. We've conceded four penalties now from handballs. 

"Maybe we need to look at our game here as well because we have different rules here."

So what do the rules say?

Wales' path to World Cup after Belgium defeat

The International Football Association Board (IFAB), who set the Laws of the Game worldwide, state that it is an offence if a player:

Deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball

Touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player's body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised

Scores in the opponents' goal: directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper or immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

The Laws of the Game do not given a definition for an arm being in a 'natural position'. 

Leagues, tournaments and governing bodies can also issue their own guidelines on the rules. 

Current Premier League rules state: "A player's hand/arm position should be judged in relation to body movement in that particular situation and players are not expected to move with their arms by their side or behind their back."

In the English top-flight, the following are all to be deemed handball offences:

Deliberate movement of arm away from body

Clear additional arm movement

Arm position - Makes body unjustifiably bigger

However, a "justifiable position/action" is not to be deemed a handball offence while proximity is also taken into account - which perhaps goes some way to explaining Bellamy's annoyance on a night on which his side had to accept the play-offs are now their likeliest route to securing World Cup qualification.

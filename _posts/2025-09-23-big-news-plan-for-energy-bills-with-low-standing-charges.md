Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Every energy billpayer will be offered a low standing charge tariff by the end of January, under new plans, but the cost of energy bills is unlikely to fall.

Those who use relatively little gas and electricity say they have no control over the fixed daily charges, which cover the cost of connecting to a gas and electricity supply.

In response, regulator Ofgem has announced a plan which would see all suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales offer at least one tariff in which such fees are lower but customers would then pay more for each unit of energy.

Despite the move, charities have warned that the underlying issue of high bills has not been addressed. 

The regulator's latest proposals are less radical than previous considered, and it  would also require tariffs to have a minimum usage level.

Ofgem said costs covered by standing charges must be paid somehow, and so has said it could only move them to another part of the bill. 

The announcement of the plans comes as energy bills for millions of people on tariffs which vary with Ofgem's price cap are rising by 2% in October.

Rising standing charges are part of that, with the fees typically rising by 4% for electricity and 14% for gas.

Standing charges pay for the cost of transporting energy to people's homes, security of the supply, investment in the energy network and some bill support schemes.

From 1 October, the charges will typically cost 53.68p a day for electricity and 34.03p a day for gas for those paying by direct debit.

However, these fees vary depending on where billpayers live. In North Wales and Merseyside, the cost will be nearly 70p a day for electricity.

Over the last year, Ofgem has been considering how to change the system after widespread concern from billpayers. The regulator's initial public consultation received an unprecedented response.

"We have carefully considered how we can offer more choice on how they pay these fixed costs, however we have taken care to ensure we don't make some customers worse off," said Tim Jarvis, from Ofgem.

Under its plans, now subject to consultation:

"The costs covered by the standing charge ultimately must be paid. We cannot remove these charges, we can only move costs around," added Mr Jarvis. 

"These changes would give households the choice they have asked for, but it's important that everyone carefully considers what's right for them as these tariffs are unlikely to reduce bills on their own."

People who cut their energy use should see a bigger reduction in bills than would be the case without these changes, he said.

Suppliers will be able to decide whether to also offer zero standing charge tariffs, with much higher unit rates.

Many charities say that rather than shifting the fee onto another part of the bill, more should be done to help those struggling to pay.

Gillian Cooper, director of energy at Citizens Advice said: "Plans to offer a lower standing charge may provide more choice to consumers, but won't bring down people's bills.

"With October's price hike just around the corner, lower standing charge tariffs will not help the millions of households bracing themselves for yet another winter of unaffordable energy bills."

Campaigners are also concerned that more tariffs could create greater confusion. 

Dhara Vyas, from Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said it was hard to see how the move warranted the potential cost and disruption.

"Ofgem admits [this] will only be temporary and merely move costs around on the bill, so delivering a limited benefit to customers," she said.

The plans will now go to consultation before a final decision is made.

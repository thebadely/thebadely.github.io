England beat world number three Jamaica in first day of Netball Horizon Series

England produced a clinical display to beat a depleted Jamaica side 80-37 at Copper Box Arena on Saturday in the opening game of their two-match series.

The hosts started positively and held a comfortable 23-point advantage over the visitors at half-time as captain Fran Williams, who was named player of the match, led by example.

Eleanor Cardwell continued her recovery from a serious knee injury, while Natalie Metcalf played for the first time since having a baby seven months ago. 

"The girls make it so easy coming into camp, which just makes it easy when you get on court. It felt really connected," Cardwell told BBC Sport:  

"I just love playing games of netball and I've not played many this year so it's really nice. 

"There has been a lot of crying this year. I didn't realise I had this much mental toughness so it's been hard but I have learned so much on this journey and I think it's going to make me a better netballer."

England had lost their previous two matches against Jamaica

Jamaica won the inaugural 2024 Horizon series 2-1, which enabled them to leapfrog England and go third in the world rankings.

The 2025 series was due to consist of four fixtures - two in Jamaica in early December and two in England - but the matches in Kingston were cancelled following the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa.

Members of the Jamaica team helped in the relief effort, handing out care packages, and have been unable to train as a whole squad.

England Netball will donate Â£1 from every Horizon Series ticket sold to Netball Jamaica's chosen charity, World Central Kitchen, and has also announced fans will be able to contribute to the British Red Cross' Disaster Fund.

But with less than a year to go until the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the Horizon Series provides crucial game time for both nations.

They will meet again for a second match on Sunday at 14:00 GMT with the action available to watch on BBC iPlayer and on the BBC Sport website.

According to new developments, Arsenal beat Barcelona last season to win the club's second Champions League title

London will host the final matches in the new Women's Champions Cup early next year, Fifa has announced.

The competition will bring together the champions of the different continental competitions, similar to the old format of the men's Club World Cup.

The four matches in the final phase - two semi-finals, a third-place match and the final - will be played in London between 28 January and 1 February.

The venue in London is yet to be confirmed.

Arsenal will be Europe's representatives in the tournament after they won the Women's Champions League last season.

In their semi-final they will face whichever team emerges from the play-off matches featuring the champions of Asia, Africa and Oceania.

Asian champions Wuhan Jiangda host Oceania representatives Auckland United in China this month. The victors face the winners of the African Champions League in December, and whoever wins that will face the Gunners.

The other semi-final will see NJ/NY Gotham, the champions of North America, take on the winners of the women's Copa Libertadores.

Fifa have also confirmed the dates for next year's Women's African Cup of Nations - which will coincide with the Women's Super League season.

The competition will take place from 17 March to 3 April 2026, during which time two rounds of WSL fixtures are scheduled.

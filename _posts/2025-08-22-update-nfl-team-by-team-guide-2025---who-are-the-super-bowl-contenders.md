Let's dive into the details: Who will challenge Philadelphia for the Super Bowl this year?

NFL is ready to return - the new season starts on 4 September, with all 32 teams hoping that this will be their year.

The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl in February, ending the Kansas City Chiefs' hopes of a three-peat.

Who will challenge for the Vince Lombardi Trophy this time around? Here, we look at every team's prospects.

Super Bowl champions

Is this the start of a new dynasty? The Philadelphia Eagles went 9-7 after their last Super Bowl victory in 2018 but they're much stronger and settled this time, and can bring back the majority of their stars, such as quarterback Jalen Hurts, his two elite receivers and generational running back Saquon Barkley.

There's change in the fearsome defence that dominated the Kansas City Chiefs in New Orleans, with some big names leaving. But Jalen Carter is a beast and will lead what is still likely to be one of the best units in the league with Vic Fangio at the helm.

Star Man: Saquon Barkley

Hurts is a star but Barkley opens up the door and was more often the difference in key moments last season. Beyond just his 2,000 yards rushing, he can score from anywhere at any time and will be the key to glory again.

'It's the worst feeling in the world' - Mahomes on Super Bowl defeat

Lost in Super Bowl

Can the empire strike back? Only one team in 32 years has returned to the Super Bowl the year after losing it, and the manner of their beatdown by Philadelphia was a huge worry.

First-round draft pick Josh Simmons will be charged with giving Patrick Mahomes the protection he lacked last year, and that will be key if Kansas City are to buck the trend. 

Star Man: Patrick Mahomes

He's the best of a generation but his numbers are on the slide and he was beaten up in the Super Bowl. He has a big point to prove and will want to make a huge statement this year.

End of a dynasty? What next for the Chiefs after Super Bowl blowout?

Lost in Divisional Round

The fourth-highest points total in history (564) - plus the achievement of being only the ninth team to win 15 games in a regular season - gave Detroit the top seed in the NFC but they still suffered another heartbreaking play-off loss at home to the upstart Commanders.

Now the question is whether they can pick themselves up yet again to launch a third straight challenge with Dan Campbell losing both his offensive and defensive coordinators this summer.

Star man: Aidan Hutchinson

The Lions have a tremendous skill group on offence with Jahmyr Gibbs (1,929 yards, 20 touchdowns) the standout, but losing defensive end Aidan Hutchinson to a broken leg last year wrecked their defence - if he's back to his best, they'll be a different animal. 

Lost in Wildcard Round

Sam Darnold revived his quarterback career with this team last year but JJ McCarthy is the starter now, having lost all of his rookie season to a knee injury. 

The pieces are all there for him to thrive, not least head coach Kevin O'Connell being something of a quarterback whisperer and a strong defence that should keep them in games.

Winning 14 again, especially playing in the NFC North, is a tough ask, though.

Star Man: Justin Jefferson

What helped Darnold, and will help McCarthy, is having a stud receiver in Justin Jefferson, who can just about catch anything regardless of being covered or not.

Lost in AFC Championship

There's only ever one question in Buffalo, and that's how can they beat the Kansas City Chiefs, with Patrick Mahomes dumping them out of the play-offs in four of the past five seasons.

They've had five years of being a consistently elite side, with reigning MVP Josh Allen a true superstar at quarterback. So the frustration is huge as each season ticks by without a Super Bowl appearance the team deserves.

Star Man: Josh Allen

After leading the top scoring offence, the MVP will have to do it all again as team officials spent the first five draft picks and most free agency money on strengthening a defence that's allowed 33 points a game in their past five play-off defeats.

Lamar Jackson is 70-24 in the regular season but 3-5 in play-off games

Lost in Divisional Round

Last season summed up the Ravens and Lamar Jackson - arguably the strongest team in the NFL but failing in the play-offs. The two-time MVP and one of the best quarterbacks around is now 70-24 in the regular season and 3-5 when it gets serious in the post-season.

Not that it's Jackson's fault as he produced one of the best campaigns on record in terms of passing. With dominant running back Derrick Henry still alongside him, they'll take some stopping.

Star Man: Lamar Jackson

The best running quarterback we've ever seen threw 41 passing touchdowns last season, with the fourth best passer rating ever recorded (119.6), and just four interceptions. His Super Bowl will surely come.

Lost NFC Championship

The Commanders made a massive jump from four wins in 2023 to 12 last season. And they were just a game away from the Super Bowl thanks to a stunning season from rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. But will he suffer the dreaded sophomore slump?

Opposing defences have plenty of film on him now to study so you'd expect some regression - especially as Washington had just three draft picks in the top 200 and will again field one of the oldest squads in the league.

Star Man: Jayden Daniels

Deebo Samuel will offer more experience for Daniels to lean on as receiver but almost everything will be put on the quarterback's shoulders again. He's got the talent but may not quite have the team to go as far as last season.

Lost in Wildcard Round

Head coach Jim Harbaugh made an instant impact last year with the Chargers defence, allowing the fewest points in the league. while quarterback Justin Herbert had his most consistent season.

Expect more textbook Harbaugh 'ground and pound' this year after the arrival of running backs Najee Harris and Omarion Hampton.

Star Man: Justin Herbert

Herbert limited his mistakes all season then threw four picks in their play-off defeat by Houston - he'll need to clean that up if they are to push on.

Lost in Wildcard Round

Head coach Matt LaFleur again had the youngest team in the NFL last season and it showed as they lost all six games against better teams, including a tough play-off defeat in Philadelphia.

They're close but still don't look to have enough stars to beat the really elite teams when it matters.

Star Man: Jordan Love

Running back Josh Jacobs carried the offence last season and while he'll be key again, if you have a quarterback on a $220m contract then he really should be the focal point.

Lost in Wildcard Round

One of just four teams to score 500-plus points last season, the Bucs offence should again be box office viewing. And they should not be underestimated as they battered eventual champions Philadelphia in week four, won away in Detroit, took the Chiefs to overtime in Kansas City and only lost in the play-offs on a last-second field goal.

Star Man: Baker Mayfield

A true all-action gunslinger, Mayfield is also box office with his quarterback play. The Bucs may get more from the season if conservative head coach Todd Bowles acts a bit more like his quarterback and goes for more fourth downs and two-point conversions.

Lost in Divisional Round

The Rams pushed the Eagles all the way in the play-offs as Matthew Stafford showed why they kept him in LA. But he's 37 and is struggling with a bad back that could limit him at any time during a long, tough season. With Stafford fit to throw to new signing Davante Adams, the Rams are a play-off team - but the doubt is there.

Star Man: Jared Verse

The offence largely takes care of itself, but the defence needs big plays, and many should come from second year linebacker Jared Verse after winning Defensive Rookie of the Year last season.

Lost in Divisional Round

It's hard to call it a sophomore slump for CJ Stroud as Houston won the AFC South and won a play-off game - all while their star quarterback was getting sacked 52 times. It's all change this year on the offensive line to try and keep their man upright.

Star Man: CJ Stroud

Just 23 but starting his third NFL season, Stroud still looked good at times despite protection issues. He should produce something of a bounce back with an improved line in front of him.

Can Aaron Rodgers have success in what looks like his final NFL season?

Lost in Wildcard Round

Aaron Rodgers embarks on what looks like his final year, but at 41 and in such a tough division, it looks a huge task to help the Steelers get a first play-off win since 2016.

Mike Tomlin managed to get 10 wins out his team last year though and Rodgers, along with big new signing DK Metcalf at receiver, offer an upgrade in attacking options.

Star Man: TJ Watt

Pittsburgh will again lean heavily on defence this season and that means the game wrecking ability of TJ Watt, who the Steelers made the highest paid non-quarterback in the league with a new $123m deal in July.

Why has Rodgers signed for the Steelers?

Lost in Wildcard Round

Denver's defence went from awful to top five last season to lead an unlikely play-off run, and head coach Sean Payton has strengthened that again with some big-name additions in free agency - things are really looking up at Mile High even if they're a bit short on offensive playmakers.

Star Man: Bo Nix

Underrated in the draft but perfect for Payton. Having a coach of his calibre should help quarterback Bo Nix to avoid a sophomore slump and produce more of the good stuff he delivered down the stretch last season.

Second in NFC West

Seattle signed quarterback Sam Darnold from Minnesota, but was his renaissance all down to the Vikings' offensive set-up? The Seahawks look decent on defence but they'll need Darnold to hit the ground running.

Star Man: Jaxon Smith-Njigba

Despite Cooper Kupp's arrival, Smith-Njigba can be the go-to guy for Darnold after his breakout year last season - when he made the Pro Bowl after 100 catches for 1,130 yards and six touchdowns. 

Third in AFC North

No quarterback had ever thrown for more than 4,500 yards, more than 40 touchdowns and had fewer than 10 interceptions yet still not made the play-offs before Joe Burrow last year.

That's how bad the Bengals defence was, and there's not too much improvement this year with their best defender Trey Hendricksen looking to leave. At least they will be fun to watch.

Star Man: Joe Burrow

It'll be tough to improve on his stats from last year, but he may have to if he wants to make the play-offs.

Third in NFC West

A reasonable season last year as Arizona doubled their win tally from 2023 and the defence really improved. Quarterback Kyler Murray and receiver Marvin Harrison Jr have to show more this season though.

Star Man: Trey McBride

A breakout season for Trey McBride resulted in Arizona making him the highest-paid tight end in the league - he'll look to repay some of that in 2025.

Second in AFC East

A truly explosive offence lost all of its spark last year, with Tua Tagovailoa throwing lots of short passes and his speedy receivers losing more than a step. Throw in a poor secondary and this could be a tough season for the Fins.

Star Man: Tyreek Hill

He said he was done in Miami after an alarming dip in form, but now Cheetah is staying, he needs to find that speed again to give this stagnated offence a boost.

Second in AFC South

Anthony Richardson, fourth pick in the 2023 draft, has lost his starting quarterback job to Daniel Jones, who had plenty of problems at the New York Giants. The defence can keep them in games but they need at least average quarterback play to win them.

Star Man: Jonathan Taylor

Has just had his best season since he was 2021 rushing champion - and he'll need more of the same to carry this offence.

Second in NFC South

The Falcons could be anything this year with Michael Penix Jr the new starting quarterback and the defence relying heavily on rookies James Pearce Jr and Jalon Walker to generate a previously non-existent pass rush. 

Star Man: Bijan Robinson

The running back had a monster year with 1,456 yards and 14 touchdowns, and he'll have to carry the offensive burden as Penix settles in.

Micah Parsons wants to leave Dallas after a fallout with owner Jerry Jones 

Third in NFC East

Another summer and more drama in Dallas with defensive superstar Micah Parsons asking to leave after a disagreement over a new contract. 

The Cowboys also have a new first-time head coach in Brian Schottenheimer to deal with that and turning around a team that's gone nearly 30 years since even making the NFC Championship.

Star Man: Dak Prescott

He has George Pickens joining CeeDee Lamb as two elite receiving options and Dak Prescott puts up good numbers when fit - but he'd prefer a decent run game to also lean on this season.

Bottom of NFC West

The Niners lost eight decent players in free agency and could not replace them as they handed quarterback Brock Purdy a massive $265m contract extension - but he's a bit light on receivers because of injuries. There's still plenty of talent in this squad but they can't afford another injury crisis like last year.

Star Man: Christian McCaffrey

McCaffrey only played four games last year because of injury but has looked sharp during the summer, so could be a huge addition if he's back to his 2023 form, when he had more than 2,000 total yards and 21 touchdowns.

Bottom of NFC South

Derek Carr's retirement should've been a big hint for the Saints to perform a complete overhaul, but they still have an ageing roster and a poor salary cap situation after some questionable free agent moves. This could be a tough year. 

Star Man: Tyler Shough

The second-round draft pick should be the starter and he's no ordinary rookie as he's 25 after spending seven seasons in college, so he should have the right temperament for what looks a tough gig this season.

Third in NFC South

The Panthers defence allowed more points than any other team in NFL history last time around, so it will take more than one off-season to pull that unit back together. It's baby steps this year for Carolina.

Star Man: Bryce Young

The former number one overall pick was benched last year but came on strong down the stretch, and with rookie Tetairoa McMillan joining Xavier Legette at receiver Young has increasingly good options to take a big leap forward.

Bottom of NFC North

Bringing in Detroit's highly regarded offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as head coach is the big off-season move the Bears hope can get the most out of last year's top draft pick Caleb Williams. Drafting a tight end prospect in the first round can't hurt either.

Star Man: Caleb Williams

Chicago have never had a 4,000 yard passer in a season but offensive guru Johnson surely has the tools now to help Williams break that duck.

Third in AFC East

New head coach Aaron Glenn wasted no time in moving on from Aaron Rodgers, and that no-nonsense approach might help to snap their run of 14 straight seasons without making the play-offs. Whether Justin Fields, on his third NFL team, can be the quarterback to do it remains to be seen.

Star Man: Garrett Wilson

He's broken 1,000 yards receiving in all three seasons even with all the quarterback issues the Jets have had - give him just a settled man throwing him the ball and he'll be electric.

Bottom of AFC West

Pete Carroll, who turns 74 in September, will become the oldest head coach in NFL history as he starts what's been an impossible job of turning this franchise around - he's the 14th man in charge since the team's last play-off win 22 years ago. He'll no doubt improve them, but it an improving division progress may be slow

Star Man: Ashton Jeanty

New quarterback Geno Smith is steady, defender Maxx Crosby is one of the best around and Brock Bowers had the best rookie tight end season on record last year, but bruising rookie running back Ashton Jeanty could be a huge star and will have plenty of carries to prove it.

Bottom of AFC East

Things could finally be turning around in New England after successive four-win seasons. Head coach Mike Vrabel knows what he's doing and bringing back offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels was a smart move - plus they spent a decent amount in free agency.

Star Man: Drake Maye

We saw enough from Maye last year to believe he's a new franchise quarterback, and although the supporting cast around him looks weak, apart from an ageing Stefon Diggs, the team overall being better should help him along. 

Third in AFC South

Trevor Lawrence really needs to start repaying some of that massive $275m contract now as we've only seen flashes - perhaps new head coach Liam Coen can do the trick as he also has weapons around him including Brian Thomas Jr, who had a stellar rookie season.

Star Man: Travis Hunter

The Jags traded up to get the NFL's 'unicorn' and next big star, who plans to play plenty on offence and defence this year. He'll be one of the biggest stories to follow in the league.

Shedeur Sanders: can he start for the Cleveland Browns?

Bottom of AFC North

Joe Flacco will start at quarterback but all eyes will be on Shedeur Sanders even if he remains the fourth choice for Kevin Stefanski. But with question marks over his three rivals and some decent pre-season work, Sanders may get his shot - and if he does Cleveland will be the place to be.

Star Man: Myles Garrett

The Browns handed their star pass rusher a monster contract to hang around so he'll be expected to be a game wrecker on the field and a leader off it. Getting caught speeding in the summer wasn't the best start.

Sanders impresses NBA legend James on Browns debut

Bottom of NFC East

Veteran Russell Wilson will be under pressure from rookie Jaxson Dart after his impressive pre-season, and the quarterback change may come sooner than later as head coach Brian Daboll's job is on the line after going from nine wins to six to three  in his three seasons in charge.

Star Man: Malik Nabers

Whoever is quarterback has a genuine star receiver in Malik Nabers, who broke the rookie record for receptions last year so should help out Wilson and likely Dart later on.

Bottom of AFC South

Going from seven wins to six to three, the Titans have been getting worse over the past few years, so there's plenty of pressure to turn around this ailing franchise from the off. It's a tough spot for number one overall draft pick Cam Ward.

Star Man: Calvin Ridley

A true number one receiver on his day, Ridley will be vital in helping Ward out of any tight spots he gets into, and has broken 1,000 yards receiving in three of past four seasons.

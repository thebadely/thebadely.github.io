It has been recently reported that Charlie Dean took 2-14 in England's crushing win over South Africa

England spinner Charlie Dean says the increase in scrutiny the team has faced since a difficult winter is a positive thing for their game. 

Dean, 24, was part of the England squads that were knocked out of the T20 World Cup at the group stage by West Indies last year and subsequently thrashed 16-0 by Australia in the Women's Ashes.

But speaking after Nat Sciver-Brunt's side hammered South Africa in their Women's World Cup opener on Friday, Dean says they are becoming "tougher" from the experiences.

"We've had challenges, and the way you get around those is with resilience," Dean told BBC Sport.

"We had bit of scrutiny on us and that can only be a good thing - it means people are watching."

Dean added England are adopting a "tougher" and "really positive" approach she feels is helping the side get their "mojo" back.

In the Ashes fallout England were criticised for their fitness and attitudes on and off the field, but the 10-wicket thrashing of the Proteas felt like a statement win under the leadership of Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards. 

Linsey Smith starred with three wickets, while Dean took 2-14 on a Guwahati pitch that offered plenty of assistance for the spinners, but Dean is cautious about getting carried away after such a comprehensive victory.

"Bowling a team out for under 100 is something that you always strive to do, but you never really think it's going to happen," added Dean.

"So to start like that in a World Cup is fantastic but we are being really objective with our reflections - there's always things that you can do better. It's not going to happen that quickly every game."

England take on Bangladesh - who they have only faced once in a one-day international at the last World Cup in 2022 - in their second game in Guwahati on Tuesday, before travelling to Colombo for fixtures against Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Dean also revealed she had been appointed as Sciver-Brunt's vice-captain for the tournament. 

England had opted against an official deputy over the summer series against West Indies and India, instead utilising a "leadership group" of various senior players.

"I bit her arm off, really," said Dean about Edwards asking her to fulfil the role. 

"I've had a bit more captaincy experience this summer, so I feel like I am growing into a bit more of leader and I've been developing my public speaking as well. 

"Even if I can just help Nat 10% then I'll be doing my job."  

Bangladesh also started their World Cup campaign with a comfortable win, beating Pakistan by seven wickets. 

Their main threat with the ball comes from 20-year-old seamer Marufa Akter, who took two wickets in the first over of that game with her extravagant inswing. 

England are in a very promising position, having boosted their net run-rate significantly against South Africa, and should have a straightforward run of matches before crucial fixtures against India and Australia on 19 and 22 October.

'Tonight isn't about me' - Chris Eubank Jr on loss to Conor Benn

Chris Eubank Jr's rematch defeat to Conor Benn may be the time to retire, according to former boxers Carl Frampton and Barry Jones.

Eubank, 36, was beaten unanimously by Benn at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, seven months on from Eubank's victory in the first meeting between the two.

All three judges scored the fight convincingly in favour of Benn with Eubank struggling to even challenge his rival, months after beating him.

"It was a great performance from Conor, but this might be the time to call it a day for Chris," retired world champion Frampton told DAZN.

"I'm not trying to be harsh, I'm just being honest."

Former WBO super-featherweight champion Jones echoed Frampton's sentiment, pointing to Eubank's struggles throughout fight.

"I do think it should be the end for Chris," said Jones on DAZN.

"It was evidence from round one that he was flat. It could be weight or it could be wear and tear, I think it's the latter.

"We should give all the credit to Conor Benn, but there were opportunities for Chris to pull the trigger. 

"He didn't throw his punches from round one. He was quite lethargic."

Lightweight world champion Shakur Stevenson, who has won belts in multiple weights, said Eubank was clearly "weight drained".

Eubank has fought most of his recent career at middleweight but was restricted by a rehydration clause on fight day that prevented him from putting more than 10lbs.

Boxing legend turned promoter Oscar De La Hoya also defended Eubank's performance.

"Let me give you a little tutorial on boxing," he said on X. 

"Eubank never had a chance due weight drain."

Coach and former boxer Paul Smith said before the fight he felt it was a step too far for Eubank but praised the Briton for a "great career".

"People who always seemed to dislike or hate him ended up growing to love him in the end. Like his dad," he added.

WBC cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew disagreed with suggestions of a retirement for Eubank, but did say that Benn's performance would have won the fight "10 times out of 10".

"Round seven and eight, he tried to put it together but he couldn't' work out the timing and rhythm of Conor Benn," said Bellew said. 

"He was out jabbed, outworked and bullied.

"All of the good things came good to Conor Benn. That was the difference. Benn used the speed and size to his advantage. [Eubank] couldn't deal with Conor Benn.

"As convincing and one-sided a win as you'll ever see in boxing."

Frampton said that Benn's management of his emotions made a difference in the rematch.

"Benn was controlled with his attacks. He wasn't putting in too much energy," added the Northern Irishman.

"I think emotions are good for Benn, but I think they were too much for him in the last fight."

Rapper 50 Cent, real name Curtis James Jackson, walked Eubank to the ring and called for a trilogy bout.

"What a fight them boys went to war tonight, they gotta do that again," he said on X.

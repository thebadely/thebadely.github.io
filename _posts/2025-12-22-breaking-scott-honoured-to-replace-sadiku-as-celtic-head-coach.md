Here’s what you need to know: Former SWPL title-winning manager Elena Sadiku has left Celtic and has been replaced by Hibernian boss Grant Scott.

Sadiku, 32, was appointed in January 2024 following Fran Alonso's exit and guided Celtic to their first-ever SWPL title in her opening six months.

However, Scott, who took Hibs to the title last season, will now takeover in Glasgow following Sadiku's appointment as boss at BK Hacken.

"It is a huge honour to join Celtic and I look forward to carrying on the great work at the club, to push on and bring even more success to Celtic," he said.

"I'm excited to join at a time when the new Barrowfield Training Centre is giving our women's team every opportunity to develop, providing the players and those coming through the academy with the best possible environment to train and come to work each day.

"I have experience of bringing success to clubs and ultimately. This is what we will all strive for again, to ensure that Celtic can be at the very top of the women's game."

Under Sadiku, Celtic qualified for the Champions League group stages for the very first time and lost narrowly to Chelsea before heavy defeats to Real Madrid.

However, they struggled in the latter stages of the league season and finished a disappointing fourth as they tried to retain their crown, finishing 15 points behind eventual winners Hibs.

Celtic are currently fourth in the SWPL table, seven points behind leaders Glasgow City. Scott leaves Hibs in fifth and six points adrift of his new side.

"Everyone at Celtic would like to thank Elena for her historic contribution during a hugely successful period," said Celtic chief executive Michael Nicholson.

"We are now pleased to welcome Grant Scott to Celtic as head coach of our women's team. Grant brings a strong track record in Scottish women's football, with proven experience of leading competitive teams and delivering success, most recently guiding Hibernian to their first league title in 18 years last season.

"We believe he is the right person to lead an important next phase of women's football at Celtic."

Sadiku added: "To the Celtic fans, thank you for your support and always being there when we needed you. Home and away you were with us at every step, and the connection we built means a lot to me.

"Celtic will always be part of my journey, and I wish everyone at the Club every success in the future."

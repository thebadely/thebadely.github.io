Here’s what you need to know: Harri Deaves will become Wales' 1,217th men's international when he starts at flanker against New Zealand on Saturday

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v New Zealand

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 22 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

Ospreys flanker Harri Deaves will win his first Wales cap against New Zealand on Saturday.

Deaves comes into the back row for injured number eight Olly Cracknell as one of five personnel changes from the side that defeated Japan 24-23.

Scarlets centre Joe Hawkins will make his first Wales start since March 2023 as he replaces Ben Thomas, while wing Tom Rogers comes in for suspended Josh Adams.

Props Rhys Carre and Keiron Assiratti return to the starting side after dropping to the replacements bench against Japan.

Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan could make his debut after being included as a replacement, with Liam Belcher injured, while Ospreys prop Gareth Thomas is also named on the bench.

New Zealand head coach Scott Robertson has made 12 personnel changes from the side that lost 33-19 to England with star names Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett rested.

Deaves will 'pack a punch' against All Blacks - Tandy

Deaves' inclusion means Tandy has instigated another back-row reshuffle with  Aaron Wainwright switching back to number eight to replace hamstring victim Cracknell, who was player-of-the-match in his first Test start against Japan.

Alex Mann reverts to his more familiar blind-side role to allow Deaves to slot in at open-side flanker.

Deaves was called up to the squad after the loss of Ospreys and Wales captain Jac Morgan to a dislocated shoulder suffered in the 52-28 defeat by Argentina.

The 24-year-old from Pontyclun was a roofer during his academy days and has defied the critics who in the past have called him too small, at a shade under 6ft (182cm) and weighing 15st 1lb (96kg).

"Harri making his debut is an amazing story," said Tandy, himself a former Ospreys open-side flanker.

"His performances for the Ospreys, both sides of the ball, have been outstanding. I love how he plays the game. 

"He's a smaller rugby player and the way he plays he adds physicality - his speed and aggression are there for everyone to see. 

"It's an amazing opportunity for Harri and we can't wait to see him go on Saturday."

Deaves is the only specialist open-side in the squad after Tandy opted to overlook Leicester flanker Tommy Reffell, who would not have been available for the Springboks finale on 29 November which is outside World Rugby's official Test window.

Mann impressed in the number seven shirt against Japan, while Wales will continue to monitor Wainwright's fitness after he came off last weekend.

If the Dragons number eight is ruled out, Taine Plumtree would step up from the bench with uncapped Ospreys back row Morgan Morse in line to be promoted to a replacement role.

Hawkins was able to resume his international career after signing for Scarlets from Exeter for the 2025-26 season.

He previously became ineligible for international selection after choosing to play his club rugby outside Wales when he left Ospreys to join Exeter in 2023, ruling him out of the World Cup that year.

The 23-year-old will now link up with Max Llewellyn in the Welsh midfield with Cardiff centre Thomas dropping out of the match-day squad.

"We've been impressed with his versatility," said Tandy.

"He can play 10 and 12 and we feel he's that second pair of hands. 

"He's trained well over the last three weeks, so it's exciting for him to get an opportunity."

Scarlets wing Rogers is recalled after missing out against Japan, with Adams suspended for the next two matches against New Zealand and South Africa following his 20-minute red card against Japan. 

In New Zealand's final Test of the year, only captain Scott Barrett, flanker Simon Parker and Will Jordan, who switches from full-back to wing, keep their places from the team defeated at Twickenham.

Savea, half-backs Barrett and Cam Roigard and hooker Codie Taylor are among the players who are rested, while number eight Peter Lakai and centre Jordie Barrett are injured.

Damian McKenzie is named at fly-half and forms an experienced midfield with the centre partnership of Anton Lienert-Brown and Rieko Ioane who have both played 87 internationals.

Robertson says his team selection is not underestimating Wales.

"We have a lot to play for this weekend," said Robertson.

"We want to put on a performance that reflects the effort and pride we have put in

"We do not underestimate the passion and resolve that Wales will bring and we know how organised, accurate and ruthless we need to be in return."

Wales have not beaten New Zealand since 1953 with the All Blacks winning the 33 internationals played between the two sides since.

Wales captaincy a 'huge honour' as Wilson targets home semi-final

World Cup qualifier: Wales v North Macedonia

Super sub for club, key for his country.

Harry Wilson has developed a reputation for making an impact off the bench for Fulham.

But he has been making the case to be considered Wales' most important player for a while now.

Never mind the fact the 28-year-old is among the leading substitute scorers in the Premier League - his five last term equalling Ole Gunnar Solksjaer's season-best tally from the bench - Wales cannot wait.

And Craig Bellamy's decision to turn to Wilson and name him captain for Tuesday's crucial World Cup qualifier with North Macedonia simply underlines it.

"He's been really important,"  said Bellamy. "And when we don't have him, we see how much we miss him."

Wilson to captain Wales against North Macedonia

The permutations as Wales target World Cup

Can Wales produce another big night under the lights?

Suspended as Wales laboured in Liechtenstein, Wilson returns in front of the Red Wall at Cardiff City Stadium with Bellamy's side in need of a win to ensure a home semi-final in the play-offs - and a potentially easier route to next summer's finals.

With Aaron Ramsey and Ben Davies injured, and Ethan Ampadu suspended, Bellamy joked there was "no-one else" left to take the armband in their absence.

But, in truth, there have been few players who have been better under Bellamy - and have been able to step up when it has mattered.

"I think with the number of caps, the number of big games I've played in, I'd like to think I'm one of the leaders in the group," said Wilson, who will win his 67th cap and described the opportunity as a massive honour and a dream fulfilled. 

"I'd much rather Ethan or Ben were playing, but it's up to me to make sure I lead us in the right way and make sure we get that win."

With 14 international goals, Harry Wilson is one shy of matching John Charles' total for Wales 

There is a quirky coincidence to Wilson being handed the armband for this game. It was against Macedonia in October 2013 that he was first called into the senior squad at the age of 16.

Three days later, in Bellamy's final game as an international player, Wilson became Wales' youngest debutant when he came off the bench against Belgium.

There is a well-told tale of Wilson's grandfather winning a sizeable bet placed from his schooldays in Corwen, north Wales when he made his debut. The Liverpool academy product smiled to confirm there was not a side bet on becoming captain.

But Wilson's rise has not been straightforward.

After those three minutes in Brussels, there was a wait of more than three years before he returned to the squad, dropping down to the under-21s while the likes of David Brooks and Ethan Ampadu stepped up.

He returned in Ryan Giggs' first game in charge in 2018 - with a goal and an assist in a 6-0 win over China - and has remained ever since.

Staying in one place has not been the tale of Wilson's club career, though. There were loans to Hull, Derby, Bournemouth and Cardiff before finding Fulham.

A vital part of promotion to the Premier League, Wilson has made 99 top-flight appearances since - only 49 of which were starts, which makes his 24 goals and assists impressive. Intelligent, versatile and dynamic, he has been seen sometimes as ideal to bring into closing stages.

But increasingly he is needed from the off - his goal against Wolves instrumental in helping Fulham end a four-match losing streak at the start of the month.

Wales have not taken as long to be convinced of what he can add.

Because not only has Wilson been Wales' top scorer since Bellamy took charge, no player has scored more Wales goals since Gareth Bale retired. Nine of Wilson's 14 goals have come in those three years.

For a nation that probably accepts they will never replace the influence of Bale, Wilson's dynamism, spark and dead-ball ability has seen him go closer than most.

They have come on the big nights too. There were the two in a 2-1 win over Croatia that re-energised the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign. It was his quickening of tempo and spark of magic that provided David Brooks with the early opening against Finland to settle nerves the last time Wales reached a play-off semi-final.

âIâd be disappointed if they felt pressureâ

Bellamy has recognised it. Wilson started all six games of the Nations League campaign that will guarantee Wales a play-off place, regardless of Tuesday tonight's result. His three goals in three matches not done since Bale in 2016.

This campaign, though, has been stop-start. A broken foot seeing him miss the opening two matches, two subsequent yellow cards ruling him out of Saturday's narrow 1-0 win in Vaduz.

"It's been frustrating; those first games came a little too soon for me," said Wilson, who returned with two goals in Wales' June games against Liechtenstein and Belgium. "The suspension stopped the momentum a little bit."

It will be interesting whether the armband takes out any of Wilson's bite that is not too dissimilar to the fire once displayed by his manager on the pitch.

While there have been acts of petulance - his red card as Wales crashed out of Euro 2020 against Denmark springs to mind - there is an edge to his game that is part of the attraction, part of the reason for success.

Streetwise is how Bellamy has put it.

"Harry uses his body in that way and if you get too tight to him, you foul him," Bellamy has said previously, likening him to Carlos Tevez and Luis Suarez. "His smartness and how he is able to press, his intensity and what he is able to do, really tells me how good a player he is."

Wales will hope Wilson shows it again against North Macedonia. From the start, of course.

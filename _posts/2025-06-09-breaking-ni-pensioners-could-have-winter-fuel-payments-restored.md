Experts revealed that Tens of thousands of pensioners in Northern Ireland could be in line to have their winter fuel payments restored after a government U-turn.

The payment to about 250,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland was cut last year in a cost-saving measure by the new Labour government.

But the government has now set a new threshold for payments, as a result of which the majority of pensioners will get the payment of £200, for those under 80, and £300 for those over 80.

One Newtownabbey pensioner told BBC News NI she could now feel more relaxed about putting the heat on if she needs to.

The money will be paid for the incoming winter.

But those pensioners earning more than £35,000 will not qualify for the payment.

Stormont Communities Minister Gordon Lyons said the U-turn was "good news".

Lyons added that it would ultimately be a decision for the Stormont Executive to reinstate the payments for those in Northern Ireland, but said he would be making that recommendation to other ministers.

He said he had conversations with Finance Minister John O'Dowd and officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on Monday afternoon.

Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Older People, Siobhan Casey, said she hoped there would be clarity for Northern Ireland pensioners on the payments.

"It would have been preferable to make it a universal payment, but we understand that this is a move in the right direction," she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra.

"I think this is a lesson for policy-makers that support for older people must be planned, protected and communicated clearly."

She added: "People are budgeting and they need to know what's coming down the tracks so they can plan for their fuel bills in the winter.

"The uncertainty around the winter fuel payment has caused older people here significant stress so I would urge clarification for Northern Ireland pensioners as soon as possible."

Newtownabbey pensioner Margaret Galloway told the programme: "It makes a difference I'm not amongst the worst hit, I'm not too bad.

"But now I feel a wee bit more relaxed about being able to put the heat on again if I need to."

She said lots of pensioners were in "real trouble"  and some people she knows were making the decision between "whether to have a meal or put the heating on".

"It has caused a lot of people a lot of concern and anxiety," she added.

"I don't think the Westminster government realised what they were doing when they cut it, they didn't realise just how much trouble it was going to cause."

Many pensioners in Northern Ireland missed out on the winter fuel payment last year after Northern Ireland followed the Westminster decision to make the payments means tested.

The move, announced shortly after Labour took office last July, led to fierce criticism from unions and pensioner charities.

An extra £17m was found following a Stormont monitoring round and Lyons secured money to grant a £100 one-off payment to support pensioners who were affected by cuts to winter fuel support.

Winter Fuel Payments were created in 1997 to help everyone above state pension age with their winter heating bills. 

The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced last year that winter 2024 would be the first time pensioners in England and Wales would not be eligible for the payment.

Northern Ireland was forced to follow suit. 

Payments were then restricted to those on benefits and pension credit.

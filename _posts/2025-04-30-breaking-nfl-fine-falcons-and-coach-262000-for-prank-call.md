It has been recently reported that Shedeur Sanders had called the prank call "childish" but played down its impact on him

The Atlanta Falcons have been fined $250,000 (Â£187,000) by the NFL after Jax Ulbrich - the son of their defensive co-ordinator Jeff Ulbrich - prank called quarterback Shedeur Sanders during the NFL Draft.

Jeff Ulbrich has also personally been fined $100,000 (Â£75,000) for the incident, which the Falcons had said involved 21-year-old Jax Ulbrich getting Sanders' number from an iPad when visiting his parents' home and writing it down to "later conduct a prank call".

In video footage on social media, Sanders can be heard taking a call from someone purporting to be the New Orleans Saints' general manager Mickey Loomis.

The caller tells Sanders the Saints will make him their next pick before saying that he is going to "have to wait a little bit longer".

Sanders - whose father Deion began his storied NFL career with the Falcons - ended up being selected by the Cleveland Browns as the sixth pick of the fifth round, and 144th overall.

The Falcons, who issued an apology to Sanders along with Jax Ulbrich, had said Jeff Ulbrich was "unaware of the data exposure or any facets of the prank".

The punishment for the incident is reported to be, external "for failing to prevent the disclosure of confidential information distributed to the club in advance of the NFL Draft." 

"We were proactive in addressing the situation internally and cooperated fully with the league throughout the process, and accept the discipline levied to coach Jeff Ulbrich and the organisation," said a Falcons statement.

"We are confident in our security policies and practices and will continue to emphasise adherence to them with our staff whether on or off premises. 

"Additionally, the Ulbrich family is working with the organisation to participate in community service initiatives in relation to last week's matter."

Sanders had called the prank call "childish" but said that "it didn't really have an impact on me".

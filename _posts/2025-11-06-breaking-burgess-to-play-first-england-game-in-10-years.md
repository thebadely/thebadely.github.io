Here’s what you need to know: Joe Burgess returns for England after helping Hull KR to the treble - scoring two tries in the Grand Final win over Wigan

Joe Burgess will make his first international appearance for a decade after being named in the 19-man England squad for the final Ashes Test against Australia.

The 31-year-old Hull KR winger made the last of his three England appearances during the 2015 series against New Zealand.

Head coach Shaun Wane confirmed he will play against the Kangaroos at AMT Headingley in Leeds on Saturday.

Burgess' return caps a remarkable 2025 season, in which he was a key part of Hull KR's treble-winning campaign.

"It's a credit to him, he has a new lease of life at Hull KR," Wane said of a player he previously coached at Wigan Warriors. "I am so happy to be able to give him a start. That means something to me."

Asked if he thought he would ever return to international rugby, Burgess said: "Yeah, if I knuckled down - I did it once, could do it again. Once you get to 31, you wonder if it is too late. But I knew I had potential to play again. That has always been the end goal.

"This has been the best year of my life, my first time winning Challenge Cup and Super League. Then being recalled back to England squad, it is an unbelievable year I still have not fully processed."

England, who have lost the first two games in the three-match series, are without wing Dom Young, who has suffered a broken foot.

The Australia team, meanwhile, features only one change to the starting line-up, with captain Isaah Yeo returning to the XIII after missing the second Test having failed a head injury assessment.

It means Australia revert to the side picked for the first Test at Wembley, with Yeo going to loose forward, Patrick Carrigan switching back to the front row, and Lindsay Collins dropping to the bench.

Saturday's match kicks off at 14:30 GMT, and is live on BBC One.

Wane responded on Thursday to criticism Burgess has faced over historical social media activity.

In 2024, the winger reposted a comment on X by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.

Hull KR spoke to Burgess, external regarding his activity on social media at the time.

On Burgess, Wane said: "I like him - he is a personality and we need more of them, we are just guiding him in a certain way.

"I don't think we should shackle him. I like him showing him personality. He is a good guy and meant no malice."

Asked by BBC Sport about his posts, Burgess said: "I let my rugby do the talking. My opinion is my opinion off the pitch, nothing to do with it."

Also returning to the England team is Harry Newman, who is in line for his first appearance of the series at the ground where he plays for Leeds Rhinos - which is sold out for the final Test.

Newman replaces Jake Wardle, while there is no spot for Jack Welsby, who was dropped following the first Test at Wembley.

It indicates Wane may shuffle his XIII and move Herbie Farnworth to his preferred left-centre position.

John Bateman also misses out with the ankle injury sustained in the build-up to the second Test at Hill Dickinson Stadium.

Newman's Rhinos team-mate Kallum Watkins is included again after earning his 30th England cap last Saturday.

Australia have already won the series after beating England 26-6 at Wembley, then winning 14-4 in Liverpool last weekend.

Experts revealed that Emma Raducanu is playing her first French Open since 2022 after missing the past two tournaments through injury

Emma Raducanu says overcoming her "biggest phobia" - a fear of needles - is helping ensure she is fully fit for her French Open return.

The British number two suffered a back spasm at a warm-up tournament in Strasbourg earlier this week and has been "managing" the issue during practices at Roland Garros.

"It feels OK, it feels good, not 100% yet, but we're working towards that. I still have a couple of days," Raducanu told BBC Sport.

The 22-year-old, who suffered a similar issue before this year's Australian Open, says dry needling and heat therapy has been helping ease the issue.

Despite the discomfort, Raducanu feels ready to play China's Wang Xinyu in Monday's first round at Roland Garros. 

"I would say the one before Australia was worse. I feel like this one I kind of caught before it fully locked up," said the 43rd-ranked Briton, who reached the second round in her only previous French Open appearance three years ago.

"At the start of the year I was so scared of needles. It was my biggest phobia. That was the only way I was going to be able to play Australia.

"Since then, I've been kind of dipping my toes into it because I know it helps even though I'm really scared of them. That's how I've kind of been trying to manage it."

Having made her comeback from wrist and ankle surgeries in April 2023, Raducanu has made solid progress this year, climbing back into the world's top 50 after dropping out of the top 300 last year.

The 2021 US Open champion has played more tournaments in the opening five months of this season than ever before.

But Raducanu said clay courts - which place more strain on the lower back because of the longer rallies and higher bouncing balls - exacerbate her back problems.

Increased resilience has been a key factor in her improvement this season, although she is unwilling to place herself at further risk.

Listening to her body - and not her former coaches - is something she has placed greater emphasis on since returning from missing the majority of the 2023 campaign.

"I just kept pushing through because people were telling me I wasn't tough enough, like I need to just work through it," added Raducanu. 

"Like it's normal I'm feeling fatigued because I'm training so much, when in reality I knew there was pain, and I knew it kind of felt more than just soreness.

"I wish I would have listened to myself sooner. I would have saved myself maybe like eight months, 12 months of struggling, but I guess I can learn from that." 

Raducanu's climb back into the top 50 has put her in a three-way tussle with Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal for the British number one ranking.

Boulter has been the nation's leading women's player for almost two years, reinforcing her status by winning a clay-court title on the second-tier WTA 125 tour last week. 

The victory moved the 28-year-old up to 38th in the world, five places above Raducanu and 15 ahead of the 23-year-old Kartal.

"I want to see Emma and Sonay, and anyone else, pushing me in the rankings," said Boulter.

"My primary focus is going to be on myself. I take being British number one as a privilege, but at the same time it's not my goal. 

"It's not something that I want to put down on a piece of paper and say that I've been that for 10 years."

Earning a first career win in the French Open main draw would boost Boulter's chances of retaining the position.

Drawing French qualifier Carole Monnet - ranked 227th - represents a golden chance to reach the second round.

Kartal is making her French Open main-draw debut after a sharp rise over the past year.

Twelve months ago, she was ranked 278th, having recovered from an unspecified illness which prompted fears over her career, and then picked up an injury on her return to court.

Now Kartal is on the verge of the top 50, although the chance to accumulate significant ranking points at Roland Garros could be hampered by a potential second-round match against 2022 runner-up Coco Gauff.

"I love the clay, I grew up playing on it," said Kartal, who opens up against Russia's Erika Andreeva. "For me, I feel comfortable on these courts. I think they suit me really well."

The trio are joined in the women's singles by British number seven Jodie Burrage, who is making her main-draw debut using a protected ranking.

The 25-year-old missed the tournament last year after rupturing an ankle ligament chasing down a drop-shot in practice.

Burrage said receiving a photo reminder on her phone this week, which showed her wearing a protective boot, has provided a timely boost before a tough test against American former world number seven Danielle Collins.

"I needed that reminder - I didn't have an amazing practice yesterday but then I was reminded that I was sat on my couch with my foot in a boot on crutches this time last year," she said on Saturday.

According to new developments, Sir Lee Pearson has competed in six Paralympics, winning a total of 17 medals

British Equestrian and British Dressage have lifted 14-time Paralympic gold medallist Sir Lee Pearson's suspension after an internal investigation into his conduct.

Pearson did not take part at the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris but is now free to compete internationally after his membership was reinstated.

"With immediate effect, Sir Lee will return to the British Equestrian World Class Programme and his membership of British Dressage is fully reinstated which enables him to compete and coach nationally and internationally," a statement from British Equestrian read.

The 51-year-old is Britain's third-most successful Paralympian with 14 gold medals, only bettered by cyclist Dame Sarah Storey and swimmer Mike Kenny.

Pearson, a Great Britain flagbearer at Rio 2016, had stated his desire to compete at the Los Angeles Paralympics in 2028, something ParalympicsGB said it was open to in a statement released last year.

"Lee has publicly stated he did not seek to qualify for Paris 2024 for personal reasons," it read.

"This is a matter for him and British Equestrian and in no way detracts from his past achievements or possibility that he may seek to qualify for future Paralympic Games."

Pearson's suspension was in place before a four-strong British Para-equestrian team was named for the Paris Paralympics last year. He had not competed since March 2023 and therefore was not eligible for selection.

His suspension was not connected in any way to equine welfare.

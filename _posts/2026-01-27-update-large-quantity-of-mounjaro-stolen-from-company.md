Here’s what you need to know: A large quantity of weight loss drug Mounjaro has been stolen from a medical distributer.

Hertfordshire Police said the drug was taken from Phoenix Healthcare Distribution, on Handley Page Way in St Albans, shortly before 18:40 GMT on Saturday.

People are being urged to make sure they are only buying the product from reputable companies as they have to be kept at low temperatures.

Phoenix provides medication to more than 6,700 clients across the UK, including community pharmacies.

Det Sgt Yolanda Morales-Willis said: "These weight loss drugs must be stored correctly and are dangerous if they are not administered in the right way.

"These, along with other pharmaceutical items, should only be prescribed via a healthcare professional or bought through registered companies."

Anyone who is offered the drugs at unusually low prices, or by unfamiliar companies, is asked to contact Hertfordshire Police.

Hull KR beat Wigan to win first Super League title

Treble winners Hull KR will start the defence of their Super League title with a visit to newly promoted York Knights in the opening game of the 2026 season.

Rovers will travel to York's LNER Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February (20:00 GMT).

Hull KR won the Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and Grand Final last season, sealing the title by beating previous champions Wigan Warriors 24-6 at Old Trafford in October.

York are one of three new clubs in Super League for next season as part of an expanded 14-team competition.

The Knights and Toulouse Olympique were selected to join the top flight by an independent panel, while Bradford Bulls were promoted in place of financially troubled Salford Red Devils after climbing to 10th in this year's grading system.

York will play in Super League for the first time while Toulouse return to the top tier after their one-season stint in 2022.

Both the Bulls, who return to Super League after an 11-year absence, and Toulouse start the campaign with away games on Saturday, 14 February.

Bradford will make the journey east to face Hull FC, while Toulouse travel to Wakefield Trinity.

Elsewhere, last season's beaten Grand Finalists Wigan start the season at Castleford on Sunday, 16 February in a game that will be live on BBC iPlayer.

The highlight of three games on Friday, 13 February is a derby between Warrington Wolves and St Helens at Halliwell Jones Stadium.

There will also be a meeting of last season's third and fourth-placed teams as beaten semi-finalists Leigh Leopards host Leeds Rhinos, who were knocked out of the play-offs in dramatic fashion by Saints.

In the final game of the opening round Huddersfield Giants make the trip to Perpignan to face Catalans Dragons.

'It's a great feeling as a manager' - McInnes

St Mirren v Hearts highlights

29/10/25

Eleven months ago, with Aberdeen locked on points with Celtic at the Scottish Premiership summit, a first league defeat of the season at St Mirren started the derailment of the Pittodrie side's league campaign.

Almost a year later, with Hearts eight points clear at the top, observers were preparing to draw parallels when Stephen Robinson's men roared into a 3-1 lead in Paisley on Wednesday.

But with a slice luck and a ton of resilience, Derek McInnes' side fought back for a second time in an enthralling encounter to claim a point, maintain their unbeaten start and keep momentum rolling.

And it could have been more had Oisin McEntee not drifted into an offside position in the build-up to Pierre Landry Kabore's late disallowed goal.

Despite their lead being cut to six points, Hearts could yet be 12 clear before Celtic finish their next Premiership match.

"It's important we win [against Dundee] on Saturday now," McInnes told BBC Scotland. "If we do, this'll be seen as a decent point.

"If anyone told me at the start of the season that after 10 games we'd be six points clear of Celtic, you'd have grabbed that with both hands. That's where we are."

With Celtic set to face Rangers in the League Cup last four on Sunday (14:00 GMT), they have a weekend without Premiership football.

Hearts, though, welcome Stephen Pressley's Dundee to Tynecastle on Saturday (15:00) knowing they can stretch their lead to nine points with a win.

The following weekend, the top two both play on the Sunday. McInnes' side host Dundee United (15:00), with Celtic kicking off at home to Kilmarnock an hour later.

That means Hearts could sitting on a 12-point advantage before the reigning champions end their next league match.

Of course, there is no guarantee the Gorgie club win either of their games. And if they do, Celtic will still have a game in hand to cut any gap.

But for McInnes' men to crank up the pressure and give themselves a buffer at the top, this is a window of opportunity they will be desperate to capitalise on.

McInnes suggested his side might have got away with one when he was asked about the decision to deny St Mirren going into a 3-1 lead in Paisley.

The VAR team deemed Mark O'Hara, who was in an offside position, interfered with play by blocking the path of Lawrence Shankland when Hearts were attempting to defend a deep free-kick.

The move ended with Miguel Freckleton escaping Hearts' high line and scoring what he felt was a third St Mirren goal, but referee Matthew MacDermid agreed with the VAR when he reached the monitor.

That set-play was one of many that caused carnage in the Hearts box, something McInnes referred to post-match.

But the Hearts boss was equally as keen to reference the resilient mentality that ensured his side left Paisley with a point, extending their 10-game unbeaten start.

"We're disappointed with the goals we lose," McInnes added. "It's the first time we've looked susceptible from set-plays.

"Sometimes St Mirren put that pressure on you and you make poor decisions. But by and large I thought we were good in the game. 

"I loved the way the team were at the end. The support stay there at the death because they feel another goal is coming. 

"That's a great feeling to have as a manager, you feel the players are doing everything to get that winning goal."

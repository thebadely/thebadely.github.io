Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Pulse are five points clear at the top of the table

London Pulse maintained their unbeaten start to the Netball Super League season on Sunday with a 67-52 win over Cardiff Dragons.

It was a seventh victory out of seven for Pulse but they were made work hard by the winless Dragons in the opening half and only led 32-25 at the break before pulling away after the interval.

Liv Tchine once again led the Pulse scoring with 25 goals but there was a strong display by Sophie Kelly who finished with eight goals and her all-round efforts earned her the player of the match award.

Georgia Rowe scored 33 goals for the Dragons.

Elsewhere this round, Loughborough Lightning secured a tense victory over Birmingham Panthers to move up to second in the table.

One point separated the two at half-time, but Lightning edged a four-goal lead in the third quarter and held on for a 72-68 success.

Fresh from their first win of the season last week, Panthers were brimming with confidence at Sir David Wallace Arena and made it difficult for the hosts.

But the defending champions kept their composure as experienced Lightning shooter Samantha Wallace-Joseph scored 34 goals, while England goal attack Berri Neil added 16.

But Panthers had their opportunities and will consider themselves unlucky not to come away with more than the one point they will receive for keeping the deficit to less than five goals.

Shooter Sigi Burger was clinical under the post, scoring 37 goals, while Betsy Creak added 10 and the defence worked tirelessly to gain possession of the ball 16 times to 10 from their opponents.

Lightning have stuttered at times this season but will be relieved to get over the line before facing a crucial match against fellow top-four contenders Manchester Thunder next week.

Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest secured a third win of the season with a 76-60 win over Leeds Rhinos.

The two sides were level on points with two wins and four losses so far in this campaign but, after a close first half, Forest dominated the second and pulled away for a comfortable win.

Manchester Thunder host London Mavericks on Monday in the final game of the round which you can watch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

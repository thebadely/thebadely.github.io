Here’s what you need to know: Adrien Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe helped Marseille finish second in Ligue 1 in the 2024-25 season

Marseille have placed Adrien Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe on the transfer list for "unacceptable behaviour" following last week's defeat at Rennes.

French midfielder Rabiot and former Norwich winger Rowe were reported to have been involved in spat after the Ligue 1 fixture.

Marseille suffered a 1-0 loss at Roazhon Park despite Rennes being reduced to 10 men in the 26th minute.

Rowe, 22, was substituted in the 63rd minute while 30-year-old Rabiot played the full 90 minutes and RMC Sport, external said the pair were involved in a post-match altercation,

Marseille said in a statement that the decision to put the pair up for sale "was taken due to unacceptable behaviour in the dressing room" after the game.

The statement added that it had been done in "agreement with the technical staff and in accordance with the club's internal code of conduct" and was "communicated to the two players by the club on Monday".

England Under-21 international Rowe signed for Marseille from Norwich for Â£17m in August 2024 and has made 31 appearances for the club, scoring three goals.

Former Paris St-Germain player Rabiot joined Marseille last September on a free transfer after five years at Juventus.

Rabiot, who has been capped 53 times for France, has scored 10 goals in 32 appearances for L'Om.

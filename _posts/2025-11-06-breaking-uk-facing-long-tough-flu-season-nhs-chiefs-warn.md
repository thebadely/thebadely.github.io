Experts revealed that The UK is facing a long, drawn-out flu season, the boss of the NHS in England is warning.

Sir Jim Mackey said there is "no doubt" this winter will be one of the toughest the health service has faced.

It comes as flu rates have started climbing early this year, which is causing concern because the winter vaccination campaign has only just got under way and there are lots of vulnerable people yet to get protected.

NHS England is issuing a "flu jab SOS", urging those eligible for the free vaccine to come forward quickly for it.

More than 13 million people have been vaccinated so far this year, but that is still more than 5 million below the number who were jabbed last winter.

Sir Jim said: "There's no doubt this winter will be one of the toughest our staff have ever faced.

"Since stepping into this role, the thought of a long, drawn-out flu season has kept me awake at night. And, unfortunately, it looks like that fear is becoming reality.

"Australia has just endured its worst flu season on record — over 410,000 cases — and all the signs suggest the NHS will face similar challenges in the months ahead. From December through to March, our hospitals will be at capacity."

People aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS. Appointments can be booked online, by phoning 119 or at local pharmacies and GPs.

Children aged two to 16 can also get vaccinated with a nasal spray. That's mainly to help stop flu spreading.

Other people can buy a flu vaccine from high street chemist shops and some supermarket pharmacies. 

Two of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions were lifted combined with immunity being low.

Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.

Flu rates are currently three times higher than normal for this time of year, with the highest rates seen in children and young people. But health officials have warned the virus will start spreading to older groups in the coming weeks.

Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said: "With just weeks left to ensure best protection against the worst of the flu season, we are issuing an urgent SOS to the eligible people who have yet to get jabbed this year.

"It is vital that the public use the available appointments we have running next week to stamp out this early wave of flu cases and help shield themselves ahead of winter.

"The vaccine is proven to be safe and help prevent those at risk from getting seriously ill and even hospitalised from flu."

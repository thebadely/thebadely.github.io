It has been recently reported that Tuchel officially began work as England manager in January 2025

England will play Uruguay and Japan at Wembley in March in their final two games before head coach Thomas Tuchel chooses his squad for the 2026 World Cup.

The Three Lions will face Uruguay on Friday, 27 March before taking on Japan on Tuesday, 31 March, with Tuchel scheduled to announced his squad in May.

"We are really pleased to have these two fixtures confirmed as our World Cup year takes shape," said Tuchel.

"We wanted to play two teams ranked in the top 20 in the world, but also to test ourselves against opponents from outside of Europe."

Uruguay are 16th in Fifa's men's rankings while Japan are 18th and both countries have also secured spots at the 2026 World Cup, which will run from 11 June to 19 July across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

England, who are expected to play two warm-up games in America before the tournament, have been drawn with Croatia, Ghana and Panama in Group L.

Tuchel's team will play all three of their group games in the US, with their first two matches against Croatia, on 17 June, and Ghana, on 23 June, kicking off at 21:00 BST.

Their final group game against Panama on 27 June begins at 22:00 BST.

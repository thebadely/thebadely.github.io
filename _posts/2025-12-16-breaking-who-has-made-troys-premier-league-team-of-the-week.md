It has been recently reported that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Bernd Leno (Fulham): Excellent for Fulham in their 3-2 win at Burnley. I know the result looks like a close game and Fulham will say they deserved to win, but Bernd Leno made five or six good saves at the start of the game that kept them in it. Burnley will feel hard done by.

Malo Gusto (Chelsea): I'm not the biggest lover of this fella if I'm being honest. I can't work out why I don't rate him but I just don't. But credit where credit is due - he scored a good goal and played well against Everton - who were poor. He seems to be stepping up. A goal and an assist. I have to be as fair as I can. 

Nordi Mukiele (Sunderland): He was excellent in the win over Newcastle. He got a yellow card but shut down Anthony Gordon, one of the best wingers in the Premier League who will probably start for England at the World Cup, and Mukiele didn't allow him to get anything going. He handled the mental appoach to it fantastically. He got the crowd involved and was part of a monumental victory for Sunderland. 

Calvin Bassey (Fulham): He chipped in with a goal at Burnley and might be my favourite personality in football - happy-go-lucky, plays with his heart on his sleeve. He's going to make mistakes but doesn't try to be perfect or polished and it was another dominant display by him. It looks like he's at fault for the first goal but it's actually Antonee Robinson running out to the left for no good reason.

Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool): Konate was under a lot of pressure and people were questioning whether he's going to be at Liverpool long-term - whether he's letting the transfer saga get to his head. He stepped up again in the win against Brighton and delivered.

Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): I'm seeing a lot of talk about the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth being the best game we've seen all year. Amateur-hour defending. But quality with the corner for Casemiro's goal and then that free-kick - you get in team of the week if you spank one of them in the top bin. He deserves that.

Ibrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): I was struggling to put Forest players in, which is weird when they won 3-0, but I thought Spurs were that bad. So bad you couldn't turn around and say 'these were great players'. But Sangare with a goal and two assists has had a great day for a holding midfielder. He's thriving under Sean Dyche. They lose him now for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, which is really disappointing.

Callum Hudson-Odoi (Nottingham Forest): He's got all the ability and potential to be whatever he wants. We need to see more games like this - goals and assists. I thought he was excellent on the day and Spurs couldn't live with him - he ran them ragged.

Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool): The most underrated striker in the Premier League. Two goals in back-to-back games. The kid scores. He comes off after 70 minutes for Alexander Isak. Fantastic signing. He will be pushing Erling Haaland all the way for most goals. This kid is mustard - he's the real deal. Another one who will be looking at the World Cup and thinking he's got to go - he can play off the left-hand side with Kylian Mbappe for France.

Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Villa are going about their business now. They showed West Ham too many opportunities - they won 3-2 away but on another day they lose. Rogers, fantastic first goal. The calmness and poise to turn and swivel on it. The second, knuckleball. You can try that 10 times and it won't go there, right in the top corner. Making a real argument that he should be starting for England in the opening game of the World Cup. He's growing as a player and a leader. It's no coincidence Villa do well when this kid does well.

Harry Wilson (Fulham): Just a player you really enjoy watching. He has no real super strength but got two assists and a goal at Burnley. So calm, so poised. Not the quickest but he'll go past you, and knows he'll go on the left foot but you can't stop him. Wonderful football player.

Arne Slot (Liverpool): A massive result against Brighton. It was all about how he handled the Mohamed Salah situation. A lot of pressure on him and Liverpool. He defused the situation perfectly. They got the clean sheet, got the win. Also he managed that Joe Gomez situation - another injury at right-back. Pivotal win for them, and when you look at the table they're seventh. Considering their bad start to the season they're a few points off the Champions League places. They'll feel happy.

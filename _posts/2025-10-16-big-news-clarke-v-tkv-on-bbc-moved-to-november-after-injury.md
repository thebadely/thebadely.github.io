Experts revealed that Olympian Clarke and Londoner TKV will both bid to become British champion for the first time in the rescheduled bout 

The British heavyweight title fight between Frazer Clarke and Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva has been moved to 29 November after TKV suffered an injury in training.

It had originally been scheduled for 25 October at Derby's Vaillant Arena and will stay at the same venue, as well as be live on BBC Two and iPlayer.

The rearranged card will still mark the first event in a new partnership between BBC Sport and Boxxer.

"Jeamie suffered an injury in training and the medical advice was he can't compete," said Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom.

"There's an extra edge to the fight. Frazer feels he's ready to win right now and is frustrated at having to completely change his training plan. 

"Jeamie will be desperate to prove he's fighting fit and capable of beating Frazer. 

"They have been quite respectful of each other up to now, but it feels like that's changing as emotions are running high on both sides."

The final details of the undercard - which will still include British bantamweight Francesca Hennessy against former atomweight world champion Fabiana Bytyqi - will be confirmed in due course.

Clarke, 34, will be bidding to win the British title for the first time, having drawn and then lost in two attempts against Fabio Wardley earlier this year.

The Burton-upon-Trent fighter - who won bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics - has nine wins from 11 professional bouts.

Tottenham's 31-year-old TKV, whose real name is Tshikeva, is also seeking redemption after his own controversial defeat to David Adeleye for the belt.

Legendary fighters, including Henry Cooper, Lennox Lewis, Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, have previously held the British heavyweight title.

Farrell steps down as Dublin boss after Tyrone defeat

Dublin manager Dessie Farrell has stepped down from his role after the county's All-Ireland quarter-final defeat against Tyrone.

Farrell spent six years at the helm, guiding the Dubs to two All-Ireland titles as well as five Leinster Senior Football titles.

An All-Ireland winner in his playing days, Farrell leaves his role after a second successive last eight exit in the Sam Maguire for Dublin after they lost 0-23 to 0-16 against the Red Hands on Saturday.

"I would have informed the county board at the start of the season that this was my last one, I let the players know there now as well, it was always going to come to an end," he told BBC Sport NI.

"It was a privilege to work with so many great people, players, coaches and backroom team over the years, tremendous servants to Dublin football and I am very grateful for all they have given in service to the county, some special relationships and memories along the way."

Farrell succeeded Jim Gavin as Dublin manager in 2020 and led the county to a sixth successive Sam Maguire win in his first season.

They then beat Kerry in the 2023 final for their second All-Ireland success under his stewardship.

Farrell admitted that the seven-point defeat by Tyrone was a tough way for him to bow out.

"We're very disappointed with the level of performance, you put a lot into this and you hope on the big days it goes well, we were out of sync, created some good shooting opportunities but our actual shooting efficiency was well below par and won't be good enough on days like this."

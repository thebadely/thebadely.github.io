Experts revealed that Fred Kerley won a silver medal in the 100m at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games 

United States sprinter Fred Kerley has been provisionally suspended for an alleged anti-doping whereabouts violation, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced on Tuesday. 

Kerley, 30, who won 100m bronze at last summer's Paris Games, could face a two-year ban if the charge is upheld. 

The World Anti-Doping Code states an athlete cannot miss three anti-doping tests and/or filing failures within a 12-month period.

In a statement posted on X,, external lawyers for Kerley said he intends to contest the allegation. 

"[Kerley] strongly believes that one or more of his alleged missed tests should be set aside either because he was not negligent or because the doping control officer did not do what was reasonable under the circumstances to locate him at his designated location," it added.

Kerley, who won 100m gold at the 2022 World Championships, last competed at the Grand Sprint Series in Norwalk, California in July. 

He withdrew from the US track and field trials last month, writing on social media that he was taking time out. 

"The 100m should be a straight sprint. 2025 has presented many hurdles," he said.

In January, Kerley was tasered and arrested by police following a confrontation with officers in Miami, Florida. Then in May, he was reported to have been arrested for allegedly punching his former girlfriend and fellow athlete Alaysha Johnson in the face.

Kerley said his arrest was down to a "misunderstanding" and he would clear his name.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Bernardo Silva joined Manchester City from Monaco at the beginning of the 2017-18 season

Manchester City captain Bernardo Silva says he knows "exactly" what he is going to do when his contract ends, but "now is not the right time to talk about it".

The 31-year-old midfielder, whose deal expires at the end of the season, said it is a "big honour and responsibility" to wear the armband.

The Portugal midfielder, in his ninth season with City, has been linked with a move, with reported interest from Juventus and Benfica this month.

Silva has won every major trophy with City, including the Champions League and  seven Premier League titles.

He was linked with a move away earlier this year, but opted to stay.

"I know exactly what I'm going to do but it's not the time to focus on it," he said.

"It's to do my best, to put the club back to where it belongs. We've had a lot of captains who've left but it's for the guys who have the most experience to pass it on to the young guys."

Silva was speaking in a pre-match news conference before he faces his former club Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 BST).

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, asked about what Silva brings to the team, said "he cannot do better as a captain".

Silva succeeded Kevin de Bruyne in wearing the armband after the Belgian left in the summer before joining Napoli on a free transfer.

"He is one of the best in training. He is an extraordinary player - so intelligent and smart. He can play in so many positions. We're really happy to have him," Guardiola said of Silva.

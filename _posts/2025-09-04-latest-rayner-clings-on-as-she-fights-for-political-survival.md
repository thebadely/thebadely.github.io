According to new developments, Many of Thursday's papers lead on Angela Rayner's stamp duty admission.

"If PM had backbone he would sack her" reads the Daily Express' headline.

The Daily Mail asks if Sir Keir Starmer is too "spineless" to fire her, reminding its readers that as well as being the deputy prime minister, Rayner is the housing secretary. It says she is "fighting to save her political career".

The Metro leads with the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's comments calling for her to be sacked.

"Three pads... zero excuses" reads the Sun's headline.

The Daily Mirror leads with another story: the family of Virginia Giuffre, who sued the Duke of York for sexual assault and later took her own life, warning that they will not be silenced.

Her brother has called for files relating to the late sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein - who was at one time friends with Prince Andrew - to be released. Ms Giuffre's claim against Prince Andrew was settled out of court. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all the allegations against him.

The Guardian highlights comments by the head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, who said forces shouldn't be "policing toxic culture war debates". His remarks follow the arrest of the comedy writer, Graham Linehan, on suspicion of inciting violence in social media posts about trans people.

Sir Mark said policing had been left "between a rock and a hard place", according to the paper.

The Times says underperforming universities could be stopped from charging full tuition fees, under plans being considered by the regulator. The paper interviewed the new chairman of the Office for Students, Prof Edward Peck, who told it that the ratings institutions get "will have consequences".

The Financial Times says scientists in London have used artificial intelligence to help teams of robots work together without colliding. It says the system, known as Robo Ballet and developed by researchers at University College London, aims to boost the efficiency of various production lines.

Some supermarket chains are introducing a new scanner, which will tell shoppers how long their avocados have before they go off, according to a report in the Daily Mail. It says the company behind the technology, One Third, wants to cut down on food waste.

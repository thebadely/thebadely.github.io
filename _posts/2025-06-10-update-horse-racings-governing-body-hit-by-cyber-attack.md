According to new developments, UK racecourses are due to stage 1,460 meetings in 2025

The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has become the latest major organisation to be targeted by a cyber attack.

The sporting body, which is responsible for the governance, administration and regulation of horse racing, first identified a ransomware incident at the end of last week. 

Its London office is temporarily closed, and staff have been asked to work from home or remotely. 

An investigation is still in its early stages, but according to a source, the incident seems limited to internal systems and data.

A spokesperson for the BHA said: "We recently identified and began investigating an IT incident. We are working at pace with external specialists to determine what happened in more detail and safely restore our systems. 

"The delivery of racedays has continued as normal and will continue to do so. We have informed our colleagues, core industry stakeholders and law enforcement."

Retailers Marks and Spencer and the Co-op have both recently been affected by cyber incidents with M&S revealing that some personal customer data was stolen.

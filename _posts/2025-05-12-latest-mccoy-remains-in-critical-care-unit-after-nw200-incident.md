It has been recently reported that Red flags were displayed to halt the Supersport practice session after the incident on Wednesday

Northern Irish rider Gary McCoy remains in the critical care unit in hospital after an incident during the Supersport qualifying session on the first day of practice for the North West 200 on Wednesday.

McCoy was transported to hospital by ambulance while Englishman Craig Neve was taken from the circuit by air ambulance after both were involved in an incident at Mill Road roundabout six minutes into the Supersport qualifying session.

In an update provided by his wife Leana, she confirmed he is still in the critical care unit in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where "he is being cared for brilliantly by the team".

McCoy has suffered an extensive list of injuries including: 11 broken ribs, two fractures in his pelvis, a punctured right lung, a broken collar bone, a fractured right wrist, a broken left thumb and a small bleed in the brain.

Leana added: "I wanted to say on behalf of Gary and myself that we are so grateful for all of the kind messages, well wishes and support shown by everyone.

"Gary has a long way to go in terms of recovery but if there is one thing I have always said about my husband is that he is the most stubborn person I know and he's proving that each day."

It has been recently reported that Pedro Rubiolo has 32 Argentina caps at the age of 23

Bristol Bears forward Pedro Rubiolo has signed a new "long-term" contract with the Prem club.

The 23-year-old Argentina lock arrived from Newcastle Red Bulls in 2024 on a three-year-deal and has now agreed a further extension.

Rubiolo has made three appearances for the Bears this season, helping them to fifth place in the table after seven matches.

"We're absolutely delighted that Pedro has chosen to commit his long-term future to the Bears," said director of rugby Pat Lam.

"At just 23 years old, he is already one of the outstanding second rows in the global game.

"Since arriving in Bristol, his impact has been exceptional, and he has quickly earned the respect of his team-mates and everyone across the club.

"His physicality and work rate are clear to see, but just as impressive is his relentless competitiveness. Pedro fights for everything in both matches and training, and his attitude sets him apart. 

"He is intensely focused on his growth and development, eager to learn every day, and fully committed to becoming the best version of himself."

Rubiolo already has 32 caps for Argentina, helping his country beat both New Zealand and South Africa this year as they have climbied to sixth in the world rankings.

"From the first day, the club has made me feel very welcome and I love the way we work, train and play together," he said.

"I believe in what the club is building and I want to keep improving, growing as a player and helping the team achieve special things."

Bristol have not disclosed the exact duration of Rubiolo's new deal.

His extension follows new contracts at Ashton Gate for England scrum-half Harry Randall, Rubiolo's compatriot Matias Moroni and inside centre James Williams.

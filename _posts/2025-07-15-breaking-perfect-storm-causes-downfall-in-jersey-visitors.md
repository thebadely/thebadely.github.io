It has been recently reported that Tourism bosses and traders in Jersey have suggested a number of factors have led to a drop in visitor numbers.

Figures released by Visit Jersey on Monday said visits to the island had dropped by 25% or 17,000 in May, down from 70,600 to 53,300 visits compared with May 2024.

Traders from the island said factors such as the cost of living, delays to the ferry schedule's release and a need for more activities or facilities had been issues. Matt Seymour, of the Seymour hotel group, said these were a "perfect storm" and it had been a "tough season" so far.

Visit Jersey chief executive Tricia Warwick said value for money, connectivity and marketing had all been recent issues for tourism businesses.

Mr Seymour said Jersey was an expensive place to visit and it was not easy to operate within the local tourism industry at the moment. 

He said: "There are so many factors at play, but they all seem to be kind of coming together to create a perfect storm this season."

Mr Seymour added he hoped prospects would pick up later in the summer but more investment was needed in facilities and attractions on the island.

"We have to be investing as an island in facilities and infrastructure that's going to support that visitor experience," he said.

The BBC has contacted Jersey's government for comment.

Ms Warwick added she remained optimistic about how the rest of the summer season would pan out and urged traders to keep working hard.

"Going forward, I think every day you can go out there and be agile and tactical and grab that business," Ms Warwick said.

"We've got campaigns out at the moment with the likes of EasyJet and [ferry company] DFDS, so we're not giving up.

"You've got to stay agile and be on it because every other destination's on it too."

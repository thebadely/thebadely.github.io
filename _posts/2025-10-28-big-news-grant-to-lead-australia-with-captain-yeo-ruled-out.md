It has been recently reported that Harry Grant captained Melbourne when they were beaten in the NRL Grand Final by a Reece Walsh-inspired Brisbane

Australia will be in "great hands" with stand-in captain Harry Grant leading the side in Saturday's second Rugby League Ashes Test against England, head coach Kevin Walters says.

The Melbourne Storm captain will lead the Kangaroos at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium, with captain Isaah Yeo ruled out after failing a head injury assessment.

Grant, 27, took over as captain when Yeo was injured in a collision with England winger Dom Young during the early stages of Australia's 26-6 first-Test win at Wembley last Saturday. 

The 30-year-old back row is now going through return-to-play concussion protocols.

Sydney Roosters prop Lindsay Collins is promoted to the starting line-up in the only personnel change to the team that started at Wembley, with Patrick Carrigan moving into the loose forward role vacated by Yeo. 

Lindsay Smith, Yeo's Penrith Panthers club-mate, steps up to the bench, with Jacob Preston named among the reserves.

"Harry and all of the senior players for that matter stepped up after Isaah's unfortunate injury last week," said former Kangaroo half-back Walters.

"While we'd love to have Isaah out there, he'll still be contributing in many other ways around the group this week. He's a natural leader, and so too is Harry so we're in great hands this week.

"I'm really pleased with the way we've started the series, but we're into a new week now and our focus is on preparing well and being at our very best this Saturday."

Brisbane Broncos superstar Reece Walsh will again play at full-back, having scored two tries and won the man-of-the-match award on his international debut at Wembley.

Saturday's second Test, and the third at AMT Headingley on 8 November, both kick off at 14:30 GMT and are live on BBC One.

Australia: Reece Walsh, Mark Nawaqanitawase, Kotoni Staggs, Gehamat Shibasaki, Josh Addo-Carr, Cameron Munster, Nathan Cleary, Lindsay Collins, Harry Grant (captain), Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, Angus Crichton, Hudson Young, Patrick Carrigan.

Interchanges: Tom Dearden, Lindsay Smith, Reuben Cotter, Keaon Koloamatangi.

Reserves: Bradman Best, Jacob Preston, Mitchell Moses.

Speaking later on Monday, England head coach Shaun Wane confirmed that he expects to make several alterations to his side for the weekend. 

"Yes [there will be changes], a few. I'm seeing the coaches again shortly. We will look into what we do and make sure the team is a lot more equipped," said Wane.

"It's not easy trying to find that blend. At the end of the day, I want a team to go out on Saturday and for it to look like a proper Test match. It didn't look like a Test match to me [at Wembley]. 

"It wasn't physical. They were better in many areas, so this week has to look like a real Test match and we need to give a better account of ourselves. Whether I make two or four changes, I am not sure yet."

According to new developments, Kim has won three World Championship halfpipe gold medals

Olympic champion snowboarder Chloe Kim says she will be fit to compete at the Winter Olympic Games next month despite dislocating her shoulder last week.

Kim, 25, had an MRI scan on Friday after injuring her shoulder while training in Switzerland.

The American is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe, after her triumphs in Pyeongchang in 2018 as a 17-year-old and in Beijing in 2022.

Kim said in an update on Instagram she was "good to go" for the Milan-Cortina games in Italy, which take place from February 6-22.

She said her labrum injury is less serious than feared, though it will prevent her from training before the Games.

"There are two different ways to do it, and the way I did it is less severe than the other, so I'm really happy about that," said Kim.

"Obviously, I'm really disappointed that I can't snowboard until right before the Olympics, which is going to be hard.

"I haven't gotten nearly the amount of reps that I would have liked, but that's OK. It's funny I've been doing this for so long, and every season I've met different challenges.

"But again, I'm so grateful that I will be good to go for the Olympics."

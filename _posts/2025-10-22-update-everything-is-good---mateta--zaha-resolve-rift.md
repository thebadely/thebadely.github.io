Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Zaha and Mateta last played together at Crystal Palace in 2022-23

Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta says he has no issues with former team-mate Wilfried Zaha after an apparent falling-out during the international break.

The 28-year-old made his France debut in a 3-0 World Cup qualifying win against Azerbaijan on 10 October, before scoring in the 2-2 draw with Iceland three days later.

But Mateta told L'Equipe newspaper, external how former Palace winger Zaha - now at Major League Soccer side Charlotte FC - was among former team-mates "who were laughing" when he expressed his ambition to play for his country.

Zaha, 32, took to social media to defend himself, saying his head was "on fire" over what he had read.

Mateta said the pair had now resolved any misunderstanding.

"I spoke with him," said the striker, who has scored 35 Premier League goals in 80 appearances since Zaha left the Eagles for Galatasaray in 2023.

"Everything is good. We talked in private, and that's it."

With a contract until the summer of 2027, Mateta - who has struck seven times for Palace this season - added he was not thinking about his future before his club host AEK Larnaca in the Conference League on Thursday.

"I'm focused on my season," he said. "I'm just thinking about the game."

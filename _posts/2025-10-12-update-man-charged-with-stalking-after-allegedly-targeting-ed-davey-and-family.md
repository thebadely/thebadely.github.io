Let's dive into the details: A man has been charged with stalking after allegedly targeting leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey and his family over a period of several months.

Inigo Rowland, who is also charged with possession of a flick-knife, is accused of turning up at the Kingston and Surbiton MP's south-west London home "unannounced" and on "numerous" occasions between June and October, according to a court list.

The 58-year-old from Surbiton appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on 7 October and was remanded into custody, the Met Police said.

Sir Ed, 59, and his wife Emily have a 17-year-old son called John, who has a neurological condition and learning difficulties, and a daughter, Ellie.

Sir Ed won the south-west London constituency of Kingston and Surbiton in 1997 and lost his seat in 2015. He regained it in 2017 and became party leader three years later.

A Met Police spokesperson said Mr Rowland was arrested on 6 October in relation to offences alleged to have taken place between June and October.

He is due to appear again at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: "We cannot provide any details at this time; Ed's number-one priority is the safety of his family."

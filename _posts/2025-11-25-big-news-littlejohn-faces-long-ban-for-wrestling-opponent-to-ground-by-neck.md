'Unnecessary nonsense!' Littlejohn 'wrestles' player to the ground

Crystal Palace midfielder Ruesha Littlejohn could be set for a lengthy ban after the Football Association said its standard punishment for her sending off - after an altercation with Leicester City's Hannah Cain - was "clearly insufficient".

Littlejohn, 35, appeared to grab her opponent around the neck before throwing her to the ground during Palace's 3-0 win in the League Cup on Sunday.

The standard punishment for a red card for violent conduct is a three-match ban, but if the FA thinks that a dismissal offence is "truly exceptional" it can seek to increase the punishment.

The case will now be considered by a regulatory commission.

An FA statement said: "A claim of clearly insufficient punishment has been submitted against Crystal Palace FC Women's Ruesha Littlejohn.

"The player was sent off around the 58th minute for violent conduct, and the standard punishment is a three-match ban, but it's claimed that this penalty is clearly insufficient."

If the claim is successful, the commission will decide a new punishment, but if it is dismissed Littlejohn will serve the standard three-match ban.

Republic of Ireland international Littlejohn - who joined Palace in September - has until Thursday to respond.

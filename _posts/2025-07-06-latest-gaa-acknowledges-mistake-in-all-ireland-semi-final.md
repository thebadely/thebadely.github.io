Watch: The Tipperary 'point' that sparked scoreboard confusion

The GAA has admitted there was "confusion" over the final score of Tipperary's All-Ireland Hurling Championship semi-final win over Kilkenny.

The full-score at Croke Park has been confirmed as a 4-20 to 0-30 victory for Tipp, but it had been recorded as a 4-21 to 0-30 win.

The confusion came after Tipperary midfielder Noel McGrath's effort in the 70th minute was waved wide but was registered as a point on the scoreboard in the stadium - which left the eventual winners with 4-21. 

That left Kilkenny chasing a goal in the closing stages thinking they were four points behind, when in theory they could have taken points to draw level in additional time as there were three points between the sides.

"The GAA can confirm that the official score at the end of the Tipperary v Kilkenny GAA Hurling All-Ireland Senior Championship Semi-Final was 4-20 to 0-30," the statement read.

"The GAA acknowledges there was confusion over the final score. 

"The CCCC is awaiting the full referees report in order to establish how the initial mistake occurred."

Speaking on the GAA Social podcast, two-time All-Ireland winner Jamesie O'Connor said: "This type of thing shouldn't happen, especially at Croke Park. 

"If it's three points with four minutes left you are more inclined to tap it over the bar. With the time that was there Kilkenny have every right to feel aggrieved. 

"It shouldn't take away from Tipp's win, which was merited, but this type of controversy, in a game of this magnitude and at headquarters with the technology that is available to us, it shouldn't have happened."

When asked if he would go off the scoreboard in the stadium if he was playing at Croke Park, Limerick's five-time All-Ireland winner Seamus Flanagan said: "100%".

"It has a massive bearing on the game, it really does," he added.

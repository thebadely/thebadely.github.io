Here’s what you need to know: An autopsy into the death of French streamer Raphaël Graven, known online as Jean Pormanove, has found it was not due to trauma, according to the prosecutor handling the case.

The content creator, known for streaming live videos on the platform Kick, was found dead at a residence in Contes, a village north of Nice, on Monday.

French government minister Clara Chappaz described his death as an "absolute horror" and launched a judicial investigation into the circumstances surrounding it.

But prosecutor Damien Martinelli said on Thursday that medical examiners believed Mr Graven's death "was not traumatic in origin" and "not related to the intervention of a third party".

He said forensic doctors had found no "internal or external traumatic injuries" or burns - only a few bruises and healed lesions.

"The probable causes of death appear to be medical and/or toxicological," he said.

He said further tests had been ordered, and Mr Graven may have had a heart issue in addition to receiving treatment for a problem with his thyroid. 

A spokesperson for Kick previously told the BBC the company was "urgently reviewing" the circumstances around his death.

Local media reported the 46-year-old had been subject to bouts of violence and sleep deprivation during streams, and died in his sleep during a live broadcast.

On Wednesday, Mr Martinelli said a number of people present at the time of the incident had been interviewed by police.

"Equipment and videos have been seized as part of the investigation in order to clarify the events that occurred prior to the death and which may have contributed to it," he said.

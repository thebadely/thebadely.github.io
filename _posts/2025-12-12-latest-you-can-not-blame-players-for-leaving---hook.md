According to new developments, Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake were Wales' co-captains at the 2023 World Cup

Former Wales fly-half James Hook says players should not be blamed for leaving Welsh rugby as Dewi Lake and Jac Morgan consider moving to Gloucester from Ospreys.

Ospreys head coach Mark Jones say losing the Wales captains would be a big blow as Lake and Morgan look likely to move to Kingsholm.

Hook, who played for Gloucester and in France with Perpignan, fears that Welsh talent will be picked off.

"This was always going to be the concern for all players this season, because of the restructure in Wales, particularly for players like Jac and Dewi," he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.

"You can't blame the players. From their point of view, it's about survival not betrayal."

Hook believes the current uncertainty in Welsh rugby only adds to the risk of a "predatory raid" from English or French clubs.

"If the regions were stable and doing well, it would be a little bit of an issue, particularly for our best players like Jac and Dewi.

"They're probably thinking 'I've got a short career and I need to financially secure my family'.

"They'll think about securing their family and creating a better future on the pitch for themselves."

Hook says it is not just seasoned internationals who will be looking to secure their futures, with more than 80 Wales-based players out of contract at the end of the season.

Ospreys scrum-half Kieran Hardy has also been linked with Gloucester while Leicester are said to be interested in Wales fly-half Dan Edwards.

"It's the same situation for Dan," said Hook.

"He's come through the academy system, I coached him from the age of 16 or 17, and we've seen him grow into the player he is today.

"He's a young 10 who wants to be competing for trophies. At the moment, the way Welsh rugby is, that's not an option so naturally he's going to be looking as well. 

"It's not just these top players who are looking, it's the others also."

Wales head coach Steve Tandy selected 13 England or France-based players in his autumn squad and former Ospreys coach Sean Holley sees that trend continuing for the national side.

"Arguably our best team will be playing in exile in England or France," Holley told the Scrum V Warm-Up programme.

Hook also believes the uncertainty as to whether the Ospreys will exist will play on the minds.

The WRU announced in October that it planned to reduce the number of professional men's sides in Wales from four to three.

Welsh rugby's governing body confirmed it proposes to grant three licences for men's clubs.

There will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which is expected to result in a straight survival fight between Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.

Another option that has now emerged is Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport & Media, taking over WRU-owned Cardiff, which could produce the desired number of three professional sides.

"For Jac and Dewi, the region might not be there in six months, so it's going to be an option for them," said Hook.

"The decision keeps getting knocked back. I don't think the union know because they said initially they want to stay with four, then they said they wanted to go to two and now they're saying they'll go to three."

Hook says that lack of clarity is a major issue for players.

"I'm speaking to a lot of people around the game in Wales, players, coaches, supporters, everybody's in the dark," he added.

"You just feel something's going to happen soon but don't know when.

"There's so much uncertainty that's just going to put that anxiety on the players. Rugby is emotional for fans, but it's employment for players."

Former head coach Holley was part of the Ospreys coaching staff who between 2003 and 2012 won four league titles and an Anglo-Welsh Cup .

The 55-year-old former full-back, who hails from Aberavon, says the region's faithful would not support losing their side.

"To Ospreys fans, it probably confirms to them what is going on behind the scenes that is not being made public," said Holley.

"There is an air of sadness, anger, disbelief. Your average fan takes things on face value. 

"Let's talk hard facts. Who has been the most successful region?"

Holley highlights anger among Ospreys fans who he says "won't entertain" a potential 40-mile trip to watch rugby in Cardiff.

"They are die-hard fans who have gone through the hardships of the 2000s, established a brand and have two generations of supporters who have only known Ospreys," he said.

"Ospreys are doing good things in the community and on the field are still reasonably competitive because they have that culture.

"Ospreys people will say they are one true region. That must count for something as well as the success. 

"It is a hot-bed of Welsh rugby. Swansea, Neath, Aberavon or Bridgend. But there has always been the feeling the Ospreys have been the target, the ones to go and that creates the anger."

And Holley, who also coached Bristol to English rugby's top-flight warns Welsh rugby has reached a critical juncture.

"We are on the precipice, we don't realise how close we are to losing our game," he said.

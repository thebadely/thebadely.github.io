Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Daily Telegraph says that the first deportation under the government's one-in, one-out scheme has been "cancelled" at the last minute. The paper said it understood a migrant was due to be flown from Heathrow to Paris on an Air France flight but it was postponed amid protest by charities and threats of legal action. The Home Office said it expected the first returns to take place imminently.

The Guardian argues that the departure of a third senior ally of the prime minister in two weeks has raised more questions about the stability of his government. Paul Ovenden quit as Sir Keir Starmer's director of political strategy after the publication of WhatsApp messages in which he relayed lewd jokes made about the MP, Diane Abbott. The paper says it's been a "bruising two weeks" for Sir Keir Starmer. "Meltdown," is the Daily Mail's verdict.

Nigel Farage tells the Times that several more senior Tories could join Reform UK, after Danny Kruger's defection. But he said it was important first to make sure they were genuinely onside with Reform in policy terms, and they had to be coming to help, not just for a meal ticket.

The Daily Telegraph suggests Donald Trump is likely - in the paper's words - to go easy on Sir Keir Starmer during his state visit because he understands the pressure the prime minister is under. Two former US officials well connected with the White House said the trip, for Trump, was likely to be about the splendour of Windsor Castle rather than day-to-day politics.

According to the Daily Express, millions of households face price rises on food in the run-up to Christmas, amid fears the Chancellor could raise taxes for businesses. Retailers in particular have warned Rachel Reeves against a repeat of anything like the hike to employers national insurance contributions.

And the Daily Mirror welcomes the introduction of what has been called the Hillsborough Law. The legislation will hold officials and public bodies criminally responsible if they lie to cover up scandals. The paper says the move honours the 97 Liverpool fans killed in the tragedy in 1989.

Title talk in December 'doesn't make sense to us' - Emery

Manager Unai Emery says any talk of the title "does not make sense" for Aston Villa despite their historic form. 

The Spaniard has overseen a club-record equalling 11 straight wins in all competitions - eight in the Premier League, where Villa sit third.

They are three points behind Arsenal and travel to the Gunners, Emery's former club, on Tuesday (20:15 GMT) but the head coach continues to play down Villa's title chances. 

He said: "To speak about the title does not make sense for us. Now, in December, it does not make sense. We are motivated and excited but for the moment we are motivated for the match we play tomorrow. 

"With three points difference between them and us, this is our motivation. 

"With how we are performing, we can feel proud of everything we are building. Tactically, mentally, individually. We are trying to feel inside as a family, we are spending more time here than with family.

"The next challenge is very difficult, the most difficult challenge we can face now because it's the best team."

Aston Villa come from behind with Watkins' second-half double

Villa have been here before - but are they really in title race?

Saturday's 2-1 comeback win at Chelsea moved Villa seven points clear of fourth-placed Liverpool and 10 above Chelsea in fifth.

Emi Buendia's last-gasp winner earned a dramatic victory against Arsenal earlier in the month with Emery wary of the Gunners' response at the Emirates.

"We must be proud of everything we're doing but we must be humble and confident and we must be ambitious as well," the 54-year-old said. 

"They [Arsenal] are playing fantastic, being so strong in everything. They are getting better and better. We are so motivated to get this moment to play against them. 

"For them it is very important because three weeks ago we beat them and they will usually want to show their power against us.

"This is the next step forward. Our test is how we can face them with our structure."

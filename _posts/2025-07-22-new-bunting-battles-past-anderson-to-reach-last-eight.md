It has been recently reported that Stephen Bunting has equalled his best run at the World Matchplay after first reaching the quarter-finals in 2019

Stephen Bunting is through to the World Matchplay quarter-finals after a nervy 12-10 win over Gary Anderson at Winter Gardens in Blackpool

A topsy-turvy match saw Scotland's Anderson lead 6-4, only for Bunting to rattle off five successive legs - a run that included missing out on a nine-darter in the 15th with the final throw.

The 40-year-old Englishman then missed a match dart to complete a 101 checkout and 11-9 success, with 2018 champion Anderson taking the leg instead to level at 10-10. 

But fourth seed Bunting responded again by claiming the next two legs, including a 112 checkout, to set up a last-eight meeting with 2023 runner-up Jonny Clayton, who beat Belgium's Mike de Decker 11-8.

"I was so, so nervous, playing a legend of the sport in Gary Anderson on this stage," Bunting told Sky Sports.

"I tried to put that at the back of my mind but I just couldn't and for whatever reason I couldn't find my best form. I'm so happy with the win but I just need to get to bed, I'm shattered."

England's James Wade averaged 102.5 and had checkouts of 126, 121 and 108 as he thrashed Wessel Nijman of the Netherlands 11-5.

"It wasn't an amazing performance from me. I was just really fortunate the young lad didn't play how he can," 2007 winner Wade told Sky Sports.

"Who cares about doubles, who cares about averages. We just care about having a great time and the crowd enjoying themselves."

Wade will play Gian van Veen next after the Dutchman, who knocked out defending champion Luke Humphries, beat compatriot Danny Noppert 11-5.

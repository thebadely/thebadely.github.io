Experts revealed that Liverpool are yet to record a win in the Women's Super League this season

This might just be the spark Liverpool needed.

After going 12 Women's Super League games without a win and sitting bottom of the table with just four points, there has been little joy for the Reds this season.

A 9-1 defeat by Chelsea in the League Cup quarter-finals last month felt like the club hitting rock bottom with recovery a distant prospect. 

But Sunday's Women's FA Cup fourthâround victory over fourth-tier London Bees finally offered a moment of light in a campaign that has felt extremely bleak.

Much to the delight of manager Gareth Taylor, there were five different players on the scoresheet in the 6-0 demolition of the Bees - including three new signings. 

Midfielder Denise O'Sullivan opened the scoring less than a day after joining from American side North Carolina Courage while striker Martha Thomas, who signed on loan from Tottenham, also announced herself in style with a headed goal on her debut. 

Alice Bergstrom, who joined from Hacken earlier this month, then scored twice in two second-half minutes to seal their first victory since a 4-1 win at Sheffield United in the League Cup on 22 November.

While new signings stole the headlines, 16âyearâold Mazie Trueman delivered another moment to savour for Liverpool by becoming their youngest-ever player.

The FA Cup victory was proof that Liverpool's January signings are capable of shifting the mood around the club, with the pedigree of their new arrivals on display against the National League Division One South East side. 

O'Sullivan, who has played 128 times for the Republic of Ireland, won two NWSL Championship titles and three NWSL Shields with the Courage while also lifting the NWSL Challenge Cup in 2022 and 2023.

"Liverpool is a massive club and when you join a club as big as Liverpool, it comes with massive responsibility," she said after signing. 

"I want to help this team and it's important to get results and that's what I'm here for, to have an impact." 

Thomas, meanwhile, has proven WSL experience with the 29âyearâold Scotland international scoring 13 goals in 66 appearances for Tottenham.

"I know of Gareth from his time at Manchester City and know how good a coach he is," said Thomas before the FA Cup tie. 

"That drew me and also to play under a coach who is an ex-striker drew me. Other than the draw of being a Liverpool fan, that's what brought me here."

The Reds have also strengthened in key areas with fellow January additions Anna Josendal, Jennifer Falk and Bergstrom as they prepare for a crucial second half of the season. 

"[Josendal] is going to be a good signing for us but she's got an injury, so is going to miss the next couple of weeks," Taylor said after the game. 

"The quicker we can get her back in the team [the better]." 

But on a day when the senior recruits delivered, Trueman offered another lift. 

At just 16 years and 88 days, the midfielder became the youngest player in Liverpool's history, surpassing Lucy Parry's previous record of 16 years and 150 days.

The teenager thought she had scored when she fired home a volley from close range only for it to be ruled out for offside while on another occasion, Bees goalkeeper Tia Ginn denied her a dream debut.  

Trueman comes from a footballing family with her brothers also part of the club's academy. Ben is a midfielder who plays for Liverpool U21s and Reece is a goalkeeper coach.

"We like Maizie and we know she's very young," the Liverpool manager said. 

"She's trained with the first team a lot this season and we just felt it was a game for her. It looked like it was really fitting for her to be able to make her first start."

Taylor will know the real test, of course, lies in the WSL.

His winless Reds remain under relegation threat but with new signings firing, young academy talent shining and a cup win that will inject some much-needed confidence into the squad, Liverpool might have the springboard to mount a genuine survival push.

"We've still got a little bit of work to do in the window," Taylor said. 

"I think [the signings were] needed last summer but at that point we couldn't make the moves we wanted to and we had to wait until now to do that." 

With 10 games left, West Ham are only one point above them, while Everton and Leicester at four and five points better off are within touching distance.

Taylor's side will next welcome in-form Tottenham on 25 January before a trip to Manchester United on 1 February.

It has been recently reported that Price has scored eight goals in 20 caps for Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland's Isaac Price says that he wants to emulate the club success that international teammates Conor Bradley and Justin Devenny have enjoyed this season.

Bradley was part of the Liverpool side that won the Premier League, whilst Devenny   lifted the FA Cup with Crystal Palace.

Price, who joined West Brom in January from Belgian side Standard Liege, believes the two players are success stories that are inspirational for him and many of his younger teammates.

"You look at Conor, he's a fantastic player. The sky's the limit for him. For a player like me, looking at him, it's something that I aspire to do. I want to go and achieve the things that he's achieved, and he's done so much already," Price said.

"I know I want to go and achieve more. The same with Justin. He's had a very successful season and got a lot of minutes for Palace.

"I think that's the hardest thing to do as a young player is to break into a first team, especially at a Premier League club. They've both done that very well."

The 21-year-old was speaking ahead of Northern Ireland's friendly against Iceland on Tuesday and admits he has played some of his best football for his country as he has felt so at home under boss Michael O'Neill.

"When I'm with Northern Ireland I feel settled straight away and with each game I keep feeling more confident," he added.

"I feel like I'm going to get chances to score and it's just about putting them away.

"A lot of it's down to the manager as well, he's put a lot of trust in me since the start. I've probably played a lot more games than I would if it was under another manager."

Scotland's Grant Forrest received a video call from Donald Trump after triumphing at the Nexo Championship, played over the US President's golf course in Aberdeenshire.

The 32-year-old won by four shots at Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, and after collecting the trophy, spoke to Trump, who was himself out playing golf at the time.

"Your name's going to be on the board for a long time Grant," Trump said in the call, shared on X by the DP World Tour., external

"I watched it, he's some player. I look forward to playing with him - in fact I will play with him tomorrow if he could get on a plane.

"Get on a plane and come over here Grant.

"We all watched you play. We just came out, what a round of golf. What three rounds of brilliant golf. 

"Your swing is great and it's a great honour you won, thank you very much."

Forrest, who lifted his maiden European Tour title at St Andrews almost exactly four years ago, took control of windy conditions over the weekend but saw his three-shot overnight advantage trimmed to two after Todd Clements' birdie on the opening hole.

However, when Forrest birdied the fourth and Clements carded a triple-bogey eight at the same hole, the Scot led by five and never looked back.

The world number 294, who double-bogeyed the last, added two more birdies and a dropped shot in a closing 72 to finish with an eight-under-par total.

"It's amazing, just speechless," Forrest said. "I think it is the same week as I won four years ago on the calendar so just amazing, that must say something about this week and being at home.

"I just can't believe it. It's been such a tough year on the golf course. It's just a crazy game that you can go and come out and do this, with what feels out of nowhere.

"It's just that old chestnut that one week can turn things around and it has."

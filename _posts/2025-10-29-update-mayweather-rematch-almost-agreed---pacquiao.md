Experts revealed that Manny Pacquiao's defeat by Floyd Mayweather is one of eight he has suffered from 73 professional fights

Manny Pacquiao says he has "almost" agreed a rematch with fellow boxing legend Floyd Mayweather.

The former multi-weight world champions first met in 2015, in what was billed as the 'Fight of the Century'.

Mayweather won after 12 rounds by unanimous decision but Pacquiao said he had a shoulder injury and told the BBC in 2018 that he "cannot retire with peace of mind with that defeat".

The 46-year-old retired in 2021 but returned to face WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in his comeback fight in July, with Barrios retaining his title after a majority draw.

Mayweather has had a string of exhibition bouts since retiring with an undefeated record in 2017 and the 48-year-old American is scheduled to face Mike Tyson next year.

But Pacquiao says Mayweather's camp are "in negotiations" over a rematch that would "probably" take place in Las Vegas.

"It depends on whether we can understand each other," the Filipino told Seconds Out., external "My people and his people [are] directly co-ordinating."

Referring to his injury in 2015, Pacquiao added: "It's very interesting because, right now, I don't have a shoulder problem.

"I'm sure the world of boxing will be excited if the rematch will push through. He has his own decision so I cannot prevent him from fighting Mike Tyson."

Mayweather's exhibition fight with former heavyweight champion Tyson, 59, is scheduled for next spring but an exact date is yet to be confirmed.

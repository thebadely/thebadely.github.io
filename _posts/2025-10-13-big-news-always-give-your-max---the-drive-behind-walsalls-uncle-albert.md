It has been recently reported that Albert Adomah showed BBC WM's Darren Wrack a day in his life

Veteran Walsall striker Albert Adomah says the mantra of "giving it the max" has been the driving force of his 18-year career.

The 37-year-old has played more than 750 matches and, in his first season at the Bescot Stadium last term, quickly achieved cult status with Saddlers fans, who have  dubbed him 'Uncle' Albert in an affectionate nod to his longevity. 

Adomah, to the supporters' delight, plays up to that with his trademark 'zimmer-frame' and 'mobility scooter' goal celebrations.

Walsall are his eighth professional club and he will stay there until at least the end of the current season after signing a new one-year contract in June.

So what makes 'Uncle' Albert tick? And what keeps him going? 

Former Walsall midfielder and BBC Radio WM football phone-in pundit Darren Wrack got special access to follow a day in the life of the Ghana international to find out. 

"I'm in trouble with my wife. Samuel somehow smashed the light. I was supposed to be doing daddy day-care, but wasn't watching him."

Adomah is standing in his front room. He has been kicking a ball with his son who seems to already have a potent shot.

"He could be the next Adomah project," he says. 

"If not, it might be Noah [his other son]. He's a bit like me. I didn't like football when I was young, so when I became a footballer, everyone was surprised."

Born in the UK, Adomah lived in Ghana until he was nine and starting playing what he called "off-the-cuff" style cage and street football.

On his return to England he played men's football from the age of 15 in Sunday leagues, amateur combination and at semi-pro level before turning professional with Barnet, and scoring on his Football League debut, aged 19, in January 2008.

Speaking in the car on the way to his sons' school, Albert says he will never take being a dad for granted.

"When I was at QPR I lived away from them all for four seasons.

"In any walk of life, being away from your kids as a dad is going to be difficult. Nowadays, we're blessed with technology, and you can do WhatsApp and video calls, but it's not really the same.

"That's why, when I left QPR, I told myself I want to find a team nearby, and that happened to be Walsall, who were the first to come in for me."

Living so close, Adomah is something of a playground celebrity.

"Some people come up to me and say, 'How was the game?' But they are all very respectful as they know I have kids," he says.

"When I was young, I followed Manchester United as they were winning everything. I was a glory hunter, yes, I'm not going to lie. 

"Aged 13, I started following my local team, QPR -  one pound a ticket. I also sold free tickets for money, as a side hustle."

Adomah was part of the Aston Villa side that won promotion back to the Premier League in 2019

On the way to training, Albert enjoys a beetroot juice, but he is not too strict about what he eats just to prolong his career.

"I tend to eat what I like, and what my wife cooks me. I never turn down my wife's cooking - Caribbean or African.".

At this stage of his career, Adomah is being used more as an impact player from the bench, but he understands the situation.

"No matter who you are, or what age you are, you want to play. But I've come to a point where I know I'm helping the team in a different light," he says.

"I know I can come on as a striker, or a wing-back or as an eight. It's not just because of my name, he [head coach Mat Sadler] plays me, I've earnt it.

"I take pride in everything I do in life, even when I was doing painting and decorating. I was an apprentice when I was a semi-pro footballer, and trained twice a week, too. 

"Working and playing football was hard, but I say to my kids now, 'Always give your max.'"

The former painter and decorator almost played in the Premier league, helping Aston Villa go up via the play-offs in 2019 before being released.

He reflects on that missed opportunity with understandable regret. 

"Obviously, I was a bit disappointed, and perhaps deserved to have a chance at the promised land, but it's not [then Villa boss] Dean Smith's fault - he didn't sign me."

Adomah, nicknamed 'Uncle', says his shirt number when he was at Aston Villa inspired him to play on until he at least 37

At Walsall's training ground, Adomah swings into his parking space - one that is testament to his unfussy approach.

"It's a spot that when it's muddy, no-one parked here, and [now] I always do," he says, before heading in for his habitual core-work "as I'm a bit old". 

Then comes breakfast - a bagel or some scrambled eggs.

In Mat Sadler's office, the boss gives an insight into why he leapt at the chance to sign Adomah after a short trial in 2024.

"You are thinking, 'Has football taken its toll on him?'" the Walsall boss says. 

"Once we saw his athleticism and enthusiasm, we couldn't do anything but try and make it work.

"It's no surprise that the fans at every club he's ever been at sing his name."

After training, it is time for Adomah to pick the kids up and take them swimming.

"It's never ending, but I still feel fresh. It's a healthy lifestyle, not doing calculations in an office, and you do appreciate it," he says.

But did he think he would be still be playing at 37? 

"The Professional Footballers' Association [PFA] used to tell us that the retirement age of a footballer was 35.

"[But] when I got to Villa and got the [number] 37 shirt, I realised my next target was 37.  

"My next milestone is 800 career games, and I've already reached 100 career goals.

"I want to retire on my own terms, knowing I'm healthy."

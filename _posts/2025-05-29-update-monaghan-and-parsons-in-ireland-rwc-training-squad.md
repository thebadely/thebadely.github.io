According to new developments, Ireland's Sam Monaghan and Beibhinn Parsons have both been included in a 37-player training squad for the Women's Rugby World Cup in England.

Scott Bemand's side begin their tournament against Japan on 24 August with New Zealand and Spain also in their pool.

Co-captain Monaghan has not played international rugby since the 2024 Six Nations with the 31-year-old lock missing this season's championship and last year's WXV1 campaign through a knee injury sustained playing for her club Gloucester-Hartpury.

Olympian Parsons has also been absent through injury after she suffered two leg breaks in the space of four months, the second coming when representing Ireland Sevens in December. 

With 26 Tests to her name, only Enya Breen has more caps than Parsons among the backs in Bemand's panel.

Forwards Sarah Delaney, Eimear Corri and Shannon Ikahihifo are all included after missing out on the Six Nations where Ireland finished third with two wins and three defeats.

Alma Atagamen and Ivana Kiripati are the only two uncapped players in the panel.

Influential forwards Erin King and Dorothy Wall have already been ruled out of the tournament through injuries sustained in the Six Nations. 

Ireland's final squad for the competition will be reduced to 32 players with the side playing warm-up games against Scotland in Cork on 2 August and Canada in Belfast  seven days later. 

The side did not qualify for the 2021 World Cup after finishing eighth on home soil four years prior. 

Forwards: Alma Atagamen, Aoife Wafer, Brittany Hogan, Christy Haney, Cliodhna Moloney, Deirbhile Nic a Bhaird, Edel McMahon, Fiona Tuite, Grace Moore, Ivana Kiripati, Jane Clohessy, Linda Djougang, Neve Jones, Niamh O'Dowd, Ruth Campbell, Sadhbh McGrath, Sam Monaghan, Sarah Delaney, Shannon Ikahihifo, Siobhan McCarthy.

Backs: Amee-Leigh Costigan, Anna McGann, Aoibheann Reilly, Aoife Corey, Aoife Dalton, Beibhinn Parsons, Dannah O'Brien, Emily Lane, Enya Breen, Eve Higgins, Katie Corrigan, Molly Scuffil-McCabe, Nicole Fowley, Stacey Flood, Vicky Elmes Kinlan.

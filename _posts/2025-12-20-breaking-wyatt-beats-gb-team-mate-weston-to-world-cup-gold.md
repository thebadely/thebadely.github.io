Let's dive into the details: Weston (left) and Wyatt (centre) became the first British men to win gold and silver at the same World Championships in March

Great Britain's Marcus Wyatt beat team-mate Matt Weston to World Cup gold in the men's skeleton in Latvia. 

Wyatt's victory comes 24 hours after two-time world champion Weston pipped him to the top spot at the same Sigulda track on Friday. 

The 34-year-old clocked a two-run time of one minute 41.37 seconds to finish 0.14 seconds clear of silver medallist Weston, 28, and just over half a second ahead of China's Zheng Yin in third.

Also on Saturday, GB's Zoe Atkin won halfpipe gold at the World Cup event in Copper Mountain, Colorado. 

Atkin, 22, who is the reigning halfpipe world champion, scored 89.25 to go top of the standings after the first run of the final. 

Australia's Indra Brown, 15, won silver and Kexin Zhang of China claimed bronze. 

Atkin narrowly missed out on gold last week when she took silver at the freeski halfpipe World Cup event in China.

Meanwhile, the win for Wyatt moves him up to third in the world rankings behind second-placed Yin and leader Weston. 

"I wanted to give Matt a better race than I did yesterday and I came in with the mindset of knowing that, if I pushed fast and executed, the win would be there," said Wyatt. 

The circuit heads into the Christmas break before returning in Winterberg, Germany on 2 January.

Amelia Coltman made it a hat-trick of medals for the British team on Friday when she claimed bronze in the women's skeleton.

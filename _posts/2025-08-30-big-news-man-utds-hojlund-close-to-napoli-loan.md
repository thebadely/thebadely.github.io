It has been recently reported that Man Utd paid Â£72m to bring Hojlund to the club from Atalanta in 2023

Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund is close to completing a loan switch to Serie A side Napoli.

Hojlund, 22, is flying out to Italy today and will undergo a medical with the Italian champions on Sunday.

United and Napoli have agreed a deal that would see the Denmark international make the move a permanent Â£38m transfer if certain conditions are met.

One of those conditions is thought to be Antonio Conte's side qualifying for next season's Champions League. 

Last month, Hojlund expressed a strong desire to remain at United but he has since been left out of all four competitive games so far this season.

Hojlund scored just four league goals for United in 2024-25.

According to new developments, Tanya Oxtoby's Northern Ireland lost 5-0 on aggregate over the two legs with Iceland

Northern Ireland manager Tanya Oxtoby says there are "areas we can really improve" - but she is "proud" of her side after defeat in the Nations League play-off.

Iceland retained their League A status with a 5-0 aggregate win over the two legs, while Oxtoby's side will remain in League B for 2027 World Cup qualifying. 

The second leg was delayed by a day after heavy snow in Reykjavik forced the game on Tuesday to be postponed. 

Sveindis Jonsdottir, Hlin Eiriksdottir and Emilia Asgeirsdottir were on target as the hosts ran out 3-0 winners in Wednesday's rescheduled game.

"I said at the start of the tie we would end up where we deserve to end up," Oxtoby said.

"I thought there was elements of that tonight that were really, really good. 

"There are areas we can really improve. We spoke about that, that we would get found out in certain areas and there would be learnings from that."

Oxtoby said the postponement of the second leg had been "challenging" and she was "super-proud" of how her players and staff had adapted. 

The former Chelsea assistant manager, who also questioned the "professional courtesy" in Croatia last year, said there was "a long way to go" in the women's game "in terms of professionalism and the way things are done".

"For the group to come out and perform how they did, the country should be super proud of the players for what they've had to deal with over the last couple of days," she added.

Northern Ireland will remain in League B for World Cup qualifying as they fell short in their bid to reach the top tier for the first time and Oxtoby said "we have work to do".

But the Australian said the progress in her young squad from when she took over as manager in September 2023 as "night and day".

"I think their application to do what we are asking is nothing short of extraordinary. I think there are small areas for us, particularly in possession, where we need to develop," she said.

"I think that comes with a bit of time and the players know the areas we need to be better at. We can't click our fingers and change that, so we need to stick together.

"The morale of this group is better than it has ever been. The desire is better than it has ever been."

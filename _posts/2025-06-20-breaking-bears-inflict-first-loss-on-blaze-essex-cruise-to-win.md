It has been recently reported that Bears' Sterre Kalis has had two half-centuries in seven innings in this season's T20 Blast 

Bears inflicted a first defeat on The Blaze in the Women's T20 Blast as they enjoyed a 25-run victory at Edgbaston.

After winning the toss, the hosts batted first and reached 172-6 with Sterre Kalis top scoring with 54.

In reply, The Blaze slipped from 71-1 to 83-4, and with Em Arlott claiming three wickets, they could only manage 147-8 as Bears leapfrogged them into second in the table.

Essex romped to a comfortable six-wicket success over Durham at Chester-le-Street.

They restricted their hosts to a meagre 101-8 off their 20 overs before reaching their target with three overs to spare.

The match in Birmingham was a meeting of two in-form sides with both having won their previous three games.

Bears opted to bat and made a fine start as Meg Austin and Davina Perrin put on 59 for the first wicket.

But Netherlands batter Kalis played the anchor innings with 54 off 41 balls to set up the total, despite a fine 4-21 from Kathryn Bryce for the visitors.

Bryce and Tammy Beaumont had put on 49 in six overs for The Blaze's second wicket, but when Bryce fell to Millie Taylor, the momentum shifted, especially when Beaumont was out for 44 in the following over.

From there, Sarah Bryce battled to 32, but The Blaze could not build any significant partnerships and ended well short of their target.

Esmae MacGregor, 20, has taken a total of 18 wickets for Essex in the Women's T20 Blast this season

Essex got on top from the start against Durham as they reduced their hosts to 17-4 inside four overs, with two wickets each for Kate Coppack and Esmae MacGregor, the leading wicket-taker in the competition with 18.

Captain Hollie Armitage held the innings together as she finished 47 not out, but she lacked any real support as Durham only just got past three figures.

Having to score at a little more than five an over, Essex immediately got ahead of the run-rate and despite losing a few wickets were never in too much trouble, even at 71-4.

And Maddie Penna and Jodi Grewcock put on an unbeaten 34 to complete the job and end a four-game losing streak as Essex climb to fifth.

Durham remain seventh after suffering their sixth loss in eight games.

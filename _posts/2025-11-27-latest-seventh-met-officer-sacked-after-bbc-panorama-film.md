Let's dive into the details: A Metropolitan Police constable who expressed discriminatory views about Muslims has become the seventh officer based at Charing Cross police station to be sacked following a BBC investigation.

PC Sean Park also boasted about pretending not to see an alleged excessive use of force by another officer who is said to have stamped on a detainee's ankle, the Met said.

October's Panorama programme showed officers calling for immigrants to be shot, revelling in the use of force, and being dismissive of rape claims.

Cdr Simon Messinger called the comments and actions "appalling", and said it was "entirely right he has now lost his job".

PC Park was found to have breached standards of professional behaviour for authority, respect and courtesy, discreditable conduct, challenging and reporting improper conduct, and equality and diversity, Scotland Yard said.

As well as failing to challenge a stamp on a detainee's ankle, he also failed to challenge discriminatory views of PC Martin Borg, previously dismissed.

PC Brian Sharkey was also due to face a hearing on Wednesday but, according to the Met, "the BBC have once again disclosed additional unaired footage to the IOPC at extremely short notice... which has now been shared with the Met".

He is due to face a hearing in February.

Previous dismissals arising from the same programme were Sgt Lawrence Hume, who said a detainee "deserves to be beaten up". He was sacked on 7 November.

On 28 October, Sgt Clayton Robinson was dismissed after a panel heard he had "trivialised" the allegation of a woman during a rape investigation and "mocked the victim" by singing a song with another officer

PC Jason Sinclair-Birt was dismissed on 24 October after being secretly filmed "boasting about and revelling in the use of force" on a detainee.

A day earlier, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg were dismissed after allegations of gross misconduct were upheld.

Sgt McIlvenny was filmed being dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegation of rape and domestic violence against her partner and making misogynistic comments.

PC Neilson was recorded referring to an "invasion" of "scum" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia.

Sgt Steve Stamp is also due to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings in the wake of the 1 October broadcast.

Let's dive into the details: Chelsea have had a bid of Â£55m for Jamie Gittens accepted by Borussia Dortmund and the winger is now set to have a medical at the Premier League club.

The 20-year-old Englishman agreed a seven-year contract with Chelsea earlier in June.

Dortmund rejected a Â£42m offer for Gittens on 10 June with the German Bundesliga side known to be holding out for Â£60m.

He was outlined as Chelsea's primary target to replace Jadon Sancho after he returned to Manchester United following his loan spell, which cost the Blues a Â£5m penalty fee. 

Mykhailo Mudryk also remains provisionally suspended after being charged by the Football Association (FA) with violating its anti-doping rules after failing a drugs test.

How Club World Cup is paying for Man City and Chelsea's summer signings

Gittens would be unable to play in the ongoing Club World Cup because he has appeared in it for Dortmund.

He would be Chelsea's fourth summer signing, joining striker Liam Delap, midfielder Dario Essugo and defender Mamadou Sarr, with midfielder Andrey Santos also returning from his loan spell at Strasbourg. 

Estevao Willian, 18, will also join Chelsea after his Club World Cup campaign with Palmeiras. 

Chelsea will next target a versatile forward with Brighton's Joao Pedro among those on the list. Brighton rejected two bids from Premier League clubs for the Brazil international, with Newcastle one of those believed to be interested.

Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike and West Ham's Mohammed Kudus are other forwards admired by Chelsea, while they have not ruled out signing an additional defender.

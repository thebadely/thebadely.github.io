According to new developments, A former Aussie Rules player has come out as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the Australian Football League's (AFL) 129-year history.

Mitch Brown, who played 94 matches for the West Coast Eagles from between 2007 and 2016, told The Daily Aus that the weight of hiding his sexuality played a "huge" part in his decision to retire.

He added that he hopes his decision to speak out will create the "safety, comfort and space" for others to come forward.

The news marks a pivotal moment for the AFL, which before Brown's announcement, was the only major professional men's sport globally to never have had an openly gay or bisexual player, even after retirement.

Brown first shared the news in a direct message to The Daily Aus's social media account after watching coverage of recent incidents of homophobia in the AFL.

"I played in the AFL for 10 years for the West Coast Eagles, and I'm a bisexual man," he wrote.

The decision to speak out came from a "feeling of peace... comfort and confidence" that he didn't have while hiding his sexuality when he was an active player, Brown said.

"It was never once an opportunity to speak openly or explore your feelings or questions in a safe way," he added.

Brown described a culture of "hyper-masculinity" in the AFL, where he heard "countless" homophobic comments hurled at him on the field.

"When I was growing up at school, the word 'gay' was thrown around constantlyâ€¦ For a man in Australia, [it was seen as] probably the weakest thing you could be."

He also recalled having a conversation with teammates about how they would feel having to shower next to a gay man.

"One of the players said 'I'd rather be in a cage full of lions than have a shower next to a gay man.'"

Brown, 36, is currently in a relationship with a female partner and was previously married to former netball player Shae Bolton, with whom he shares two sons.

The announcement comes after several high-profile homophobic incidents in the AFL.

Last week, Adelaide Crows player Izak Rankine received a four-week ban for using a "highly offensive" homophobic slur during a game.

Addressing the incident, Brown said he would like to see a "sense of change" in the league through the lifting up of "positive male role models".

"My advice to the AFL would be, let's celebrate the players who may not be the most successful, but they're the most important players in our community."

Brown said he believes there are currently gay and bisexual players in the AFL who remain closeted.

He encouraged fans to have empathy for all players and shared a message for those who still don't feel comfortable enough to speak out.

"I see you and you are not alone."

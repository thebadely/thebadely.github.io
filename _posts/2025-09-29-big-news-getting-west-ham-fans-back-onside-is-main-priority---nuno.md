Premier League highlights: Bowen rescues point for West Ham at Everton

West Ham's "main priority" is bringing the club's fans and players closer together, says new manager Nuno Espirito Santo but he knows there is "a lot of work" to do.

After recent protests, chants of "sack the board" could be heard during Monday's 1-1 draw at Everton, Nuno's first game in charge of the Hammers after replacing Graham Potter.

But, after Jarrod Bowen's second-half equaliser had earned them a spirited point, the former Tottenham and Nottingham Forest boss took his players over to the travelling supporters at the end of the match in a show of unity and togetherness.

"What I think is important is to appreciate what our fans did traveling to Liverpool on a Monday night and giving the support they've given," he said. "It's our main priority to come closer to our fans. 

"We have to deliver so they can appreciate the work of the boys. Moving forward it's important."

After beginning his tenure with a point on the road, Nuno said his players will "embrace the challenge".

"I think the team competed well," the Portuguese manager said. "It's a tough, tough place to come, a very good team.

"Overall it was a good game, intense, both teams had chances. The message for us [to the players] is how we can compete now."

Nuno said he has avoided making too many changes to West Ham's tactics and is instead focusing on making incremental improvements.

"Simple, don't change too many things," he responded when asked about his approach. "When you arrive at a club it's about slowly progressing and trying to find the right options and solutions. Now it's how we can improve them."

'Keep it simple' - Nuno reaction to first match as West Ham manager

There were not many notable differences in the statistics for the Hammers against Everton compared to the rest of the season.

That was to be expected given Nuno has been in charge for two days and he is "starting" to implement the "small steps" needed for change.

Their 14 shots was more than their average of 10.2 in their previous five Premier League games, although they had fewer shots on target than their average.

Most notable was the fact that they managed 29 touches in Everton's box whereas they had averaged just 19 across their other league games so far.

While they were marginally more direct in the way they played - with 13.8% of their passes played long compared to 11.6% previously - it was good play in transitions which proved the most dangerous against Everton, with Crysencio Summerville being involved in many of their attacking moves.

Bowen added that Nuno kept it "simple and basic" with his approach to the game. 

"There wasn't loads of change because he understands there were only two days and it's been a lot for the players," the West Ham goalscorer told BBC Radio 5 Live. "He just kept it simple and basic.

"We've got a really good group, who want to do well and get us out of the position we're in. Regardless of any manager change, we look at ourselves, we take responsibility because we're the ones who play week in week out. 

"We've got to go out on the pitch together and fight in the Premier League every single week."

Experts revealed that On a farm nestled in the Surrey Hills, young people are helping herd cows and build pens so they can be wormed.

They are spending time on Pondtail Farm in Brockham, near Box Hill, to help boost their mental health as part of the Care Farm project.

Katie Daw, the Surrey Hills Society Care Farm co-ordinator, said the scheme was boosting young people's confidence and wellbeing, and reducing anxiety.

Ronnie, aged 17, said helping out on the farm was "like heaven on earth to me".

"People are sleeping better, eating better, wanting to actually get up and get out of the house, which a lot of them really can't because their mental health is so bad,"  said Ms Daw.

"We take anybody that's suffering from mental health or needs a boost with their health and wellbeing and we take them out to working farms."

She said that sessions involve farm jobs such as "collecting eggs or tagging cattle", depending on "what they need for their mental health".

"It's been really impactful, there has been a couple of participants that have looked into doing agriculture as a career," she added.

She said it also had a knock-on effect for families and carers and could make a "massive difference".

Ronnie, 17, has found solace on the farm and learnt new skills.

She said: "Just being around nature makes me quite a lot happier and just being here is like heaven on earth to me.

"It means quite a lot to me just being around the animals."

Peter, who is 16, said he enjoyed "just getting away from everything" and found the farm peaceful.

Nellie Budd, from Pondtail Farm, said: "There's always something different to do and for them to come and have a look at.

"I've definitely seen quite a few of them change and feel more confident with and around the animals."

One young person would not go near the animals on their first day but "they won't even hesitate" now, she said.

"It's given them the confidence they need to realise that they can achieve things."

Thea, 14, has now gained a place at agricultural college to study horticulture.

She said Care Farm had given her "a lot more confidence with people and animals".

Bethany, who is 17, added: "I really enjoy spending time with the cows and all the different animals around.

"It's just a good way to get out to the house and spend time in the countryside." 

The pilot scheme is backed by a Â£65,900 award from the Mental Health Investment Fund and the Surrey Hills Farming in Protected Landscapes programme.

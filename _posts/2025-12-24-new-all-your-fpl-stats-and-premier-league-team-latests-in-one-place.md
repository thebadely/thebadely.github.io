United will monitor Kobbie Mainoo, who was ruled out of that game after picking up a minor calf injury in training the day before.

Casemiro is available after suspension.

Newcastle are hoping goalkeeper Nick Pope will be fit enough to make the matchday squad after a groin injury.

The Magpies have been dealing with a defensive injury crisis but Tino Livramento's knee is not as serious as had been feared, while Sven Botman is making good progress after a back problem.

Anthony Gordon (Â£7.3m) recorded his first assists of the season for Newcastle against Chelsea in gameweek 17. In the past four gameweeks, he has also successfully converted two penalties.

Nick Woltemade (Â£7.3m) scored twice against Chelsea on Saturday to take his Newcastle goal tally for the season to seven - only three FPL forwards have scored more.

Nottingham Forest have no new reported injury problems.

Manchester City, who will have had a week off between matches, will assess their squad after they return from the three-day break manager Pep Guardiola has given them.

But Guardiola has warned his players that they will be weighed on their return: "The moment they arrive I want to see how they come back. They can eat but I want to control them. 

"Imagine one player and now he's perfect but he will arrive with three kilos more. He will be in Manchester, he will not travel to Nottingham Forest."

Players out: Man City - Kovacic, Ait-Nouri, Marmoush

Nottingham Forest - Sangare, Boly, Aina, Wood, Yates

Doubts: Man City - Stones, Doku, Rodri, Bobb

Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson (Â£5.3m) has produced 20 defensive contribution points this season, the most of any midfielder.

Only one defender has amassed more FPL points than the 36 of Manchester City's Ruben Dias (Â£5.7m) since gameweek 13.

Gameweek 17 was only the second time in six starts that Manchester City's Rayan Cherki (Â£6.6m) has blanked, yet he still created more chances (six) than any other player.

Only Marcos Senesi (Â£4.9m) has achieved more defensive contribution points than the 22 of Joachim Andersen (Â£4.6m). The defender has kept two clean sheets in the last six gameweeks and is the second-highest scoring player at Fulham (63).

Sunderland are still without Luke O'Nien, who is serving a three-match ban.

Habib Diarra has now travelled to the Africa Cup of Nations, where he will join five other Black Cats players: Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Reinildo, Chemsdine Talbi and Bertrand Traore.

This game comes too soon for Leeds midfielder Sean Longstaff, who has a calf injury.

Winger Daniel James is still out with a hamstring injury.

Players out: Sunderland - Diarra, O'Nien, Traore, Talbi, Reinildo, Sadiki, Masuaku, Alese

Leeds - James, Longstaff

Doubts: Leeds - Nmecha

Key FPL notes:

Sunderland's Robin Roefs (Â£4.8m) has kept back-to-back clean sheets to move on to six shut-outs for the season. He is the highest-scoring goalkeeper in FPL with 80 points but remains a differential, with an ownership of just under 10%.

In his past six home matches, Sunderland defender Dan Ballard (Â£4.7m) has produced 36 points for an average of just over seven points per appearance.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Â£5.8m) has scored six goals across the past five gameweeks. During this period, Erling Haaland (Â£15.1m) is the only forward to have returned more FPL points than the Leeds striker's 44 or had more than his seven big chances.

Players out: Crystal Palace - Sarr, Kamada, Munoz, Doucoure

Tottenham - Romero, Simons, Maddison, Sarr, Bissouma, Udogie, Solanke, Kulusevski

Key FPL notes:

Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi (Â£5.3m) is the second-highest scoring defender in FPL (93). He has produced two goals, four assists and six clean sheets in total but has mustered only two shut-outs since gameweek 10 (against Burnley and Wolves).

Maxence Lacroix (Â£5.2m) is among the five best defenders in FPL. Seven clean sheets, two assists and 14 defensive contribution points have helped the Palace centre-back amass 82 points in total.

Only four forwards have produced more goals in the past seven gameweeks than Tottenham's Richarlison (Â£6.4m), with four.

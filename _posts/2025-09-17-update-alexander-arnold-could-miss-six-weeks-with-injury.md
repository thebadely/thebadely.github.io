According to new developments, Trent Alexander-Arnold won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2019

Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to miss up to six weeks with a hamstring injury sustained in Real Madrid's Champions League win over Marseille.

Alexander-Arnold, 26, started Tuesday's match at the Bernabeu but was forced off in the fifth minute having injured his left leg.

Real Madrid confirmed the injury following tests on Wednesday morning.

Sources have indicated Alexander-Arnold will be out for at least a month, with his absence potentially running to six weeks.

Alexander-Arnold joined Real on 1 June after Liverpool accepted a fee to release the defender early from his contract.

The full-back was not named in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia, and is now a major doubt for next month's games against Wales and Latvia.

It also leaves him in a race against time to be fit for Real's visit to Liverpool on 4 November, which would be Alexander-Arnold's first return to Anfield since his move.

Alexander-Arnold made five appearances for Real at the Club World Cup over the summer - providing two assists - and has featured five times across all competitions in 2025-26.

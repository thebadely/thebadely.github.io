Experts revealed that Dragons forward Aaron Wainwright played for Wales at the 2019 and 2023 World Cups

Dragons will do all they can to prevent talisman Aaron Wainwright following Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake in leaving Wales.

The number eight is out of contract at the end of the season and the Rodney Parade club know he will have suitors.

The 28-year-old turned down other offers in favour of signing a new â and lucrative â Dragons deal in January 2024.

There is a concern that a fresh rugby challenge could appeal to Wainwright, who has won 62 caps, but the club will ensure that any exit would not be for financial reasons.

"Waino is really important to us and we are having chats about retaining him," said head coach Filo Tiatia.

Wainwright has made 127 appearances and consistently been Dragons' stand-out player.

He was man of the match on Sunday in the 23-21 comeback victory against Lyon that ended a near year-long winless streak, making nine tackles, 14 carries and having several key moments on the gain line.

"We want to keep him here, he is a Gwent man and his performance last weekend showed how important he is, not only for Dragons but Wales," said Tiatia.

"He is a beautiful man and inspirational in the way that he does things â he is uniquely Aaron Wainwright, he understands what he is about and what he brings. We want to keep him in the building."

Dragons are keen to establish his plans for the future in the coming weeks before pressing on with recruitment in January.

The Rodney Parade club, who signed a new Professional Rugby Agreement with the Welsh Rugby Union in May, will have an increased playing budget of approximately Â£6m next season.

Wainwright's main rival for the number eight jersey is currently Mackenzie Martin, who is on loan from Cardiff and is out of contract next summer.

Tongan international Solomone Funaki joined in the summer of 2024 but has not made a competitive appearance because of a serious knee injury.

With Dragons without a United Rugby Championship win since the opening weekend of last season, there is an acknowledgement that the squad needs to be strengthened in key areas.

The Wainwright situation is different to the position that Ospreys find themselves in because of uncertainty over their future due to Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) plans to cut to three clubs, with just one in the west.

Morgan and Lake will move to Gloucester next summer and fellow internationals Kieran Hardy and Dan Edwards have also been linked with English clubs.

Tiatia is an Ospreys legend after helping them to league titles in 2007 and 2010, plus the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2008.

"With Dewi and Jac, you are really disappointed that they have taken up another opportunity but also totally understand why," said the former All Blacks forward.

"I messaged Jac to say it was sad to see him leave the Ospreys but that I understood and he replied back.

"I do feel for our clubs not able to keep our best players in Wales, it's definitely a challenge and there could be a few more doing the same thing.

"We just need to make sure we keep our best players here in Wales to help grow the game."

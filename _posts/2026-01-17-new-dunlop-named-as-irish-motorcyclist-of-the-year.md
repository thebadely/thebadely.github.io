Experts revealed that Michael Dunlop celebrates on the podium after clinching TT win number 33 with a Supertwins success

Michael Dunlop has been named as Irish Motorcyclist of the Year for the third time.

The 36-year-old collected the Joey Dunlop Trophy at the annual gala awards evening on Friday night following another successful year on road race circuits in Ireland and on the Isle of Man.

Dunlop added four further IOM TT victories - two in the Supersport class and two in the Supertwins category - to extend his record number of successes at the iconic Manx event to 33.

The Ballymoney rider also brought to an end a nine-year drought at the North West 200 when he secured a hat-trick of wins over the 8.97-mile Triangle circuit.

He took triumphs in the Supersport and Superstock races during Thursday night's racing, and followed that up with a win in the second Superbike event of the meeting on Saturday.

Dunlop also took doubles at the Cookstown 100 and Tandragee 100 Irish national road race events.

Dunlop's dramatic Superbike win at the North West 200 was named Race of the Year.

Jonathan Rea, who called time on his distinguished World Superbike career at the end of the 2025 season, was presented with a Special Recognition Award in light of his six consecutive titles in the series from 2015 to 2020.

Donegal rider Rhys Irwin was chosen as Short Circuit Rider of the Year after winning the British Supersport championship, with Ulster Superbike champion and Sunflower Trophy winner Carl Phillips the Short Circuit Rider of the Year on Irish circuits.

Casey O'Gorman, who made his debut in the Moto3 GP series at world level, was selected as Young Rider of the Year, while Emma McQuaid collected the Female Trailblazer prize.

Last year, Emma once again made history by becoming the first female ever to represent Ireland in a mixed-gender Nations team â not only in Quad Cross of Nations, but across any Nations event where men and women compete together. A milestone moment, not just for Emma, but for motorsport itself.

The Joey 25 event, held in Ballymoney in May to celebrate the life and racing career of Joey Dunlop 25 years since his passing, was the Event of the Year.

Davey Todd won the King of the Roads crown following a season which yielded a treble at the North West 200, a first win in the Superbike race at the TT, a Southern 100 Solo Championship success and a Macau Grand Prix victory.

Cork racing outfit Team 109 received the Team of the Year after becoming the first Irish team to win a world championship in short circuits - the World Supersport 300 series - with 17-year-old Benat Fernandez their rider.

Former British 250cc champion Adrian Coates was inducted into the Hall of Fame, with Dungannon's Paul Cranston collecting a Services to Motorcycling award, reflecting his lengthy involvement in competing in the sport on both roads and short circuits.

David Allingham received the BSB Breakthrough Award after a hugely impressive campaign in the British Superstock series which saw him finish runner-up in the series and take a double success at the Brands Hatch round in late July.

Cole McCullough was named Off Road Rider of the Year after achieving a maiden win in grand prix motocross.

It has been recently reported that Keely Hodgkinson claimed gold in the 800m in Paris last year

Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson has signed up to compete in the all-female Athlos New York City event this autumn.

Athlos is a project backed by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian's venture capital firm Seven Seven Six.

The Briton, who has not raced since winning 800m gold at the Paris Olympics last August, will compete in the second edition of the athletics event on 10 October.

The 23-year-old misses the London Diamond League meet this weekend as a result of a hamstring tear in February.

British 400m record holder Amber Anning - who won two relay bronze medals at the Paris Olympics and the individual world 400m indoors title in March - and American 200m Olympic champion Gabby Thomas are among those also participating.

Last year's winners took home $60,000 (Â£44,603) - one of the largest prize purses in athletics. 

Ohanian is married to 23-time tennis Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams and bought an 8-10% stake in Chelsea Women in May.

The inaugural competition took place last September and was a track-only event but the second meeting will include the long jump, which is set to be headlined by American Olympic champion Tara Davis-Woodhall.

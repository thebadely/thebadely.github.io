According to new developments, A council is asking residents to support foodbanks and help families in hardship this Christmas.

East Riding of Yorkshire Council said people could make donations to the East Riding Food Poverty Alliance, including food and household items, or volunteer their time.

The council said donation points would be located at its leisure centres, libraries and multi-service centres, including Hornsea Hub, from Friday 28 November.

Jo Ramsay, chairwoman of the alliance, said: "Your support helps us provide not just food, but hope, dignity and a lifeline to those facing hardship in our communities."

Ms Ramsay added: "Hunger often hides in plain sight. It affects neighbours, colleagues and families across our region."

The council said the alliance had provided more than 360,000 meals to people in crisis between 2024 and 2025, supported by the council's regeneration and funding team.

The authority said residents could also donate at Bridlington Spa, as well as South Cliff Caravan Park.

Residents can donate tinned goods, cereals, pasta, rice, snacks and tea and coffee. They could also donate non-food items, such as toiletries, household essentials and pet food.

Volunteers were also needed to help with food sorting, packing and distribution.

Councillor Lyn Healing, cabinet member for communities and public protection, said: "The allowance plays a key role in supporting the vulnerable across our communities, and we're proud to support their vital work.

"We encourage residents to get involved and help out this Christmas, and throughout the year."

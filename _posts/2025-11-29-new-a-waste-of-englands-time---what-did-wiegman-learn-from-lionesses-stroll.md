Experts revealed that Lucia Kendall came on as a second-half substitute against China

England fans could not have hoped for a more entertaining evening at Wembley Stadium - but with Sarina Wiegman resisting the urge to be more experimental, how much did she actually learn from it?

After winning Euro 2025, the Lionesses have played three of their four friendly matches which were designed as a "homecoming" celebration.

Their latest, an 8-0 demolition of China on Saturday evening, was the pick of the bunch but it was not the test they perhaps hoped for.

Wiegman was understandably pleased with the display, which included a Georgia Stanway hat-trick, but there was a real lack of competition from China.

It was the tried and tested players who delivered on the scoresheet and England were in control of possession, dominating 70% of the ball as they cruised to victory. 

By half-time they were 5-0 up and the game was won, although Wiegman said she still learned something from the performance.

"Yes, of course we always learn something from the game. What we really wanted to do was start well," said Wiegman.

"They played in a little different shape to what we expected so that took a few minutes but after that, we started playing really well.

"We had a little bit more time on the ball and then you saw how good we are. We connected well and I thought we scored some really good goals.

"I also think that because we played so well and scored so early, that China were struggling even more."

As one BBC Sport live text reader, Brian, wrote: "What is the point of this match? It is a waste of England's time."

It was a harsh assesment after such a dazzling display - which the 74,611 inside Wembley Stadium no doubt enjoyed - but could Wiegman have given more minutes to some of England's unfamiliar stars?

Former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley told BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra 2: "I think the opportunity may have been missed to start a few more debutants or give players more caps - maybe make some changes a bit sooner.

"We knew it was going to be comfortable maybe a quarter of the way through the first half. 

"This felt more like an opportunity for the fans to come and see the players as opposed to anything they are really going to glean from a tactical point of view."

Lucia Kendall impressed on her debut in a 3-0 win over Australia last month so to experience a sold-out Wembley from the start would have been invaluable. She did come on, but not until the 68th minute with England already leading 6-0.

Forward Freya Godfrey, 20, was an unused substitute after earning her first call-up this week, while Taylor Hinds picked up her second cap, but only played 15 minutes.

The one player who was handed a debut - goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse - had little chance to impress because of the dominance of her side.

It was a very experienced midfield and frontline in the starting XI with Aggie Beever-Jones having to sit out for regular number nine Alessia Russo.

An injury-hit defence did see changes, though Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy was still on the bench.

Ian Wright said on ITV before kick-off: "At some stage, that has to happen [to see more youngsters]. We want to see more of those players. 

"I think with the World Cup in 2027, we need to know that there are players who can come through and make the step up."

These friendlies are the opportunity to do that. 

Stiff competition lies ahead with World Cup qualification starting in March - and a double header against world champions Spain in 2026. 

It is rare that Wiegman does not have pressure on her shoulders and England, while an 8-0 win should be applauded, does not have much to gain when connections are being strengthened between players who may not feature in two years' time.

Could Wiegman have changed things up even more when England's lead was so dominating, so early on?

"We take every game seriously and when we substitute three players at half-time I think that's enough," she said. 

"We have a squad of 25 and there are many players that are knocking on the door. Everyone wants to play. 

"Some players are just coming into the squad and finding their feet. Other players have done a great job for us and are competing for starting positions. Changing one or two players, I didn't want to do that."

With the Chinese domestic league ending on 28 September, and the national team not playing together since July, it was an easier night than many expected.

But it did not take away from England's impressive display.

Aside from a series of set-pieces early on, China could barely lay a glove as England were ruthless, clinical and composed throughout.

One of the standout performers was Arsenal's Beth Mead - the Euro 2022 top-scorer who has faced increased competition for her place in the side.

It is easy to see why Wiegman so often turns to Mead in big games, however, when she links up so well with right-back Lucy Bronze and creates numerous opportunities from wide positions.

She set up big chances for Russo and Lauren Hemp either side of her two goals and almost everything came down her side in a rampant first half.

"Me, Georgia [Stanway] and Lucy [Bronze] have had the chance to play together for a lot of years now and I think that showed today," Mead told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"We found the spaces, we rotated really well, we filled in for each other and we caused problems for their left side."

Mead may have been the star of three years ago but she's clearly still contributing, so has she evolved?

"I think she's improved. She's always been a smart player - picks up positions, is very calm in the final third and always keeps seeing pictures," said Wiegman.

"That's what she did today too. What we've invited her to do even more is make more rotations and pick up more positions and feel the freedom to do that. 

"She's had more experiences in football and life, and keeps developing, but technically she's improved also."

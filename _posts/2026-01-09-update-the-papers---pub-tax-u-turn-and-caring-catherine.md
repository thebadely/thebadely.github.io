Let's dive into the details: The government's climbdown on business rates for pubs features on several front pages - with The Daily Mail calling it "too little too late". The paper says hospitality bosses think the move is "just not enough". The Daily Express has a similiar sentiment, saying "cheers! It's yet another u-turn". It says the prime minister has "flip-flopped again".

The Daily Telegraph quotes the reaction of the Labour MP it says led a rebellion against the rate hike. Emma Lewell says she's "deeply sorry" to pub owners who've had to close their doors, and people who've lost their jobs. Speaking to The Times, sources "close to the chancellor" deny she was forced into a U-turn. The paper says the Treasury wanted to "cushion the blow" for pubs.

Elsewhere on its front page, The Times says Britain's most senior military chief has warned that the Ministry of Defence faces a £28bn shortfall over the next four years - even if the government increases core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035. The paper quotes a military source as saying some "big ticket items" must be cut. The MoD says the defence budget is "rising to record levels".

The Guardian leads on further allegations that the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage used racist language while at school in South East London. Nigel Farage has previously said he "never directly racially abused anybody" and has called the claims "made up fantasies".

The i Paper says at least 50 ships, suspected to be part of Russia's shadow fleet, have been recorded in British waters in the past three days. It quotes an ally of the prime minister as saying the UK is ready to use "hard power" against Moscow. Downing Street has said it's preparing to undertake operations against the shadow fleet.

And Catherine, Princess of Wales features on several front pages, including the Mirror and the Express, after she made an unannounced visit to Charing Cross hospital in central London. She spoke about her experience of chemotherapy. Catherine is quoted by the Sun as saying the "kindness" of NHS staff helped her during treatment.

Here’s what you need to know: Mark Jones replaced Toby Booth as Ospreys head coach in December 2024

Ospreys head coach Mark Jones says the squad were told owners Y11 Sport & Media are in talks to buy rivals Cardiff in a meeting on Tuesday, which some players walked out of.

Uncertainty has arisen after the Ospreys owners emerged as the preferred bidders from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) to purchase the Arms Park side.

Ospreys players, coaches and staff held a meeting with chief executive Lance Bradley on Tuesday where Jones says they were told about the Cardiff interest, which is the the first confirmation's of Y11's involvement.

"What we do know from yesterday's meeting is our owners are interested in discussing a potential purchase of Cardiff," said Jones.

"The feedback from the chief executive was they are in discussions with the WRU and Cardiff and around what that looks like.

"We don't know anything really about it, that's information going to be shared in a short space of time."

Jones confirmed some players walked out of the meeting and a full-scale training session was cancelled on Tuesday.

"There was a variety of feelings, not just anger," said Jones.

"Anger was one, frustration, confusion and probably a bit of fear around the unknown, which can cause anxiety.

"Players were frustrated with some of what they were hearing. Some were upset and just wanted their own space.

"It's natural individuals wanted to do that and I support that. It was just one or two players."

Afterwards a number of Ospreys players, including Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake and internationals Sam Parry, Dan Edwards and Gareth Thomas, shared a statement on social media saying they "have been left in the dark by the WRU and Y11".

Jones backed the actions of his players.

"It was awesome, it was great to see them coming together like that," said the head coach.

"They are a tight group and enjoy each others' company. You could see that by the statement. 

"Nobody asked them to do that, it was off their own back as a group of men deciding what they wanted to say and what they wanted people to hear. I support them 100%."

The Y11 news has sparked concern among supporters who fear it could mean the end of the region as the WRU prepares to reduce the number of professional sides from four to three.

Jones says he heard the news of Y11's interest from his wife, who showed him a media article.

The former Wales wing says the uncertainty is the major issue, with little clarity from the meeting.

"We didn't get anywhere near the amount of clarity everyone was looking for," said Jones.

"There are so many things that are unknown. It does make it difficult. I understand there's levels of conversations that happen way above my remit and my role and have to remain private.

"Where this has been difficult is the leaks that have happened before our people and family have been told what's coming out. That's the hard bit to deal with.

"That's the frustrating bit, we're hearing it second-hand and sometimes through my children or my partner. Everybody else is the same.

"They're asking questions and you don't have the answers and that's the most difficult thing to manage at the moment."

Jones was asked whether he thought Ospreys being in talks to buying Cardiff was a betrayal.

He replied: "It depends what it looks like. What does buying Cardiff mean? That's what the question on everybody's lips, that's the crucial bit. Then you can decide whether it's a betrayal or not.

"We don't know what is behind it at the moment, so once we get that and understand what the why is, what the plan is, what it looks like for each individual and team, then you can decide whether you think it's a good thing or not."

Jones says they have been told Ospreys will be continuing for the 2026-27 season and jobs were guaranteed for 18 months.

"That's what we are told, we are carrying on as normal," said Jones.

"That's always been the case from when this started around reducing the regions.

"We know we will be carrying on as best we can in this year's competition and next year. 

"That's a period of time where we have got our current funding deal signed and sealed and we have to honour."

Jones says Ospreys must continue in Welsh rugby.

"Professional rugby in this area is massive," said Jones.

"I have lived in this area for 16, 17 years and my sons both played junior sport in the area. They love the Ospreys.

"It's awesome to have a team like the Ospreys as a figurehead for young players to strive towards and putting the badge on your chest.

"I want that ambition to remain in the area for the youngsters so they have a clear goal of why they want to play the game.

"The Ospreys have to play a part in Welsh rugby moving forward, that's one thing I am absolutely sure of."

Legal action considered over Ospreys future as players hit out

Jones is trying to prepare his side for a United Rugby Championship (URC) match against Lions in Bridgend on Friday (19:45 GMT).

"It has been a tough week, this isn't something you'd plan in to try and be high performance," said Jones.

"As a coach and member of the Ospreys, it isn't helpful at all. The difficult thing to deal with is the shock and losing a day of training is not ideal either.

"There was still some distraction [on Wednesday] but boys have come in with energy and enjoyment into the environment.

"From a physical perspective, the players are going out there and putting their bodies on the line. 

"It also affects our people not on the field as well and they are equally as important."

Jones had a message for players who are concerned about the future and fans who are considering protesting against the management.

"It's difficult to tell somebody how to feel but the players and staff have talked about how we have a job to do to represent our region and our families," said Jones.

"If any group can do it, it's this group. What we can influence is our performances, preparation and how hard we work for each other in the week and the games.

"We can give as much positive energy around our supporters and fans by our performances. That's what we can control, as tough as it is going to be."

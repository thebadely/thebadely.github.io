Let's dive into the details: It's still only early November, but Christmas adverts are already coming thick and fast.

While they feature the usual sprinkle of festive cheer, experts say this year’s ads have also been tapping into some of 2025’s biggest themes, from the cost of living to masculinity.

The idea of hardworking families trying to get by is at the centre of Asda’s advert, which depicts the Grinch trying to do his Christmas shopping.

Meanwhile, John Lewis’s festive advert explores masculinity and emotion, leading some analysts to suggest it has undertones of one the year's biggest TV shows, Netflix drama Adolescence.

“What's striking this year is how the Christmas adverts are letting real life in,” said retail expert Kate Hardcastle.

TV historian Dr Richard Wallace adds that if retailers can find a way to “incorporate a topical social issue in a careful way”, it can lead to an advert “really cutting through”.

The BBC has looked at the Christmas adverts that are out so far - and asked experts what they tell us about the past year.

The John Lewis Christmas advert - seen by many as marking the start of the festive season - was beamed into our homes on Tuesday.

Set to Alison Limerick's 1990s track Where Love Lives, reimagined by British artist Labrinth, it's the first time the retailer has centred an ad around a father-son relationship.

The ad depicts a teenage boy, who struggles to express his emotions for his dad, using music as a way to connect with him.

We see the dad discovering an unopened Christmas present with his name on it - a vinyl record of Where Love Lives - which he immediately puts on.

As the song fills the room, he's transported back to a 90s club, dancing with his friends, before seeing flashbacks of his son as a baby.

When we return to the present day, the teenage son and dad share a slightly embarrassed hug and laugh together.

Reacting to the ad, retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth said it has "Adolescence written all over it".

"Especially with its focus on the lack of communication between father and son," she told BBC News.

Dr Wallace agreed, saying the advert had given a classic Christmas message of togetherness "a 2025 twist".

"There is clearly a desire to incorporate topical issues into this year's adverts," he said.

"John Lewis has responded to the crisis of masculinity, so evocatively addressed in one of this year's standout TV dramas Adolescence, to make a touching piece that speaks to the challenges of navigating inter-generational male relationships."

John Lewis's director of brand Rosie Hanley told BBC News that the script had been planned in January, before Adolescence came out.

But the drama's huge success "gave us reassurance that we were telling a story that was really relevant in 2025," she said.

Other retailers appear to have nodded to the cost of living.

The Asda advert, set to the song Let it Snow, follows The Grinch reluctantly doing his festive shop.

But the green cynic changes his tune once he's wowed by some of the low price products on offer.

For Dr Wallace, the ad sends a message that "an affordable Christmas" is possible, by "placating the cash-strapped 'Grinch' that threatens to spoil everyone's Christmas".

This message is echoed in Lidl's Christmas advert, which focuses on generosity and small acts of kindness rather than abundance and excess.

The ad also has a real-world action point, by pointing viewers towards Lidl's Toy Bank scheme.

According to Lidl, the nationwide scheme has seen over 250,000 gifts donated since launch.

The theme of community and affordable, practical cheer, is also present in the M&S food advert.

The ad sees the return of Dawn French as a festive fairy, and she also appears as herself.

We see the actress and comedian stuck in gridlocked traffic, but with a wave of the fairy's wand, a delivery truck is converted into a Christmas party.

The festive snacks served at the party are modest and a far cry from the tables of food that we've seen in past adverts.

But not all of the retailers have toned it down this year.

Beauty retailer Sephora's advert stars none other than Mariah Carey as an angel.

She later transforms into a Santa Claus bodysuit, and takes off in a sleigh filled with bags of shiny gifts.

Experts say that as a whole, this year's adverts are reflecting the fact many shoppers will be worrying about costs this Christmas.

“Value framing is part of the campaign this year,” said Shuttleworth. “And of course that’s relevant this Christmas.”

"We're seeing themes that reflect the world as we actually live it," agrees Hardcastle.

 "Audiences don't want fantasy; they want recognition. It's proof that even at Christmas, the stories that move us most are the ones that see us."

Elsewhere, a number of retailers have gone for fictional characters. Again, this is being seen as a deliberate move given the economic backdrop.

"If you're struggling and someone's showing you a glossy life on screen, it's not going to make you feel particularly great," Hardcastle said.

In the Aldi advert, its mascot Kevin the Carrot is back. This time, he is set to pull our heart strings as he pops the question to his beloved Katie the Carrot.

Not to be outdone, Sainsbury's advert also features a famous animated character - Roald Dahl's beloved Big Friendly Giant.

And Argos has also gone for the same characters as last year - cartoon duo Connie the doll and Trevor the dinosaur - who are joined this year by Inbetweeners star Simon Bird.

Advertisers are set to spend a total £12bn during this festive period, according to the latest Advertising Association and World Advertising Research Centre data.

John Lewis, for its part, doesn't disclose how much it spends on its Christmas advert, but Ms Hanley said they are "confident it pays off".

And experts say it's about more than just getting consumers through the doors.

"Fundamentally, the Christmas advert is about emphasising a sense of community and togetherness," Dr Wallace told BBC News.

Dr Wallace said that while the ads are still made for broadcast television, they are also now viral internet events, and are shared widely online.

The challenge for retailers, he said, is reflecting the "mood of the nation" when Christmas adverts are planned months in advance.

"If they can get it right, they can really become TV moments," he said. 

"They can set the tone for that particular year, and shape the way you remember that Christmas."

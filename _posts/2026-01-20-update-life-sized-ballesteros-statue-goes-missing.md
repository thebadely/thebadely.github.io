Here’s what you need to know: Seve Ballesteros won three Open Championships and two Masters titles 

A life-sized statue commemorating five-time major winner Seve Ballesteros has gone missing from his hometown of Pedrena in Spain.

Spanish authorities are investigating after Marina de Cudeyo town council said on Instagram, external that the "unfortunate event" at the weekend indicates the statue was stolen.

Spaniard Ballesteros, who helped Europe win four Ryder Cups as player and then captain, died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 54.

"If anyone has observed suspicious movements, especially in the last 24 hours, please let the Civil Guard or the local police know," the council said.

The bronze statue was created in 2009 by sculptor Salvador Garcia Ceballos and was permanently installed in La Barqueria Park in 2017.

It captures the moment Ballesteros celebrated a famous victory at the Open Championship at St Andrews in 1984.

Ballesteros was trailing Tom Watson in the final round but came back to win by two shots and claim the Claret Jug, denying the American a third successive Open.

Pedrena is near Santander in the Cantabria region in northern Spain.

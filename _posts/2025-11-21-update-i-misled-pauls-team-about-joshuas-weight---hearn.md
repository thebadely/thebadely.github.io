Let's dive into the details: Two-time world champion and Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua has won 28 professional fights and lost four 

Promoter Eddie Hearn says he misled Jake Paul's representatives by claiming Anthony Joshua was heavier than he was in order to agree a favourable weight stipulation for their fight.

Briton Joshua, a former two-time unified heavyweight champion, will face the YouTuber-turned-boxer at the Kaseya Center in Miami on 19 December.

Joshua has weighed more than 250lb (17st 12lb) in each of his past three fights, but must come in under 245lb (17st 7lb). Both fighters will wear regulation 10oz gloves.

"I spoke to AJ and he was sitting at 265lb (18st 13lb) or something like that. I think I told Nakisa [Bidarian - co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions] that he was 290lb (20st) or something like that," Hearn told the 5 Live Boxing podcast. 

The fight, streamed live on Netflix, is scheduled for eight three-minute rounds.

It will be a professional contest between one of Britain's most decorated heavyweights and a former Disney Channel actor who has reinvented himself as a pay-per-view attraction.

"I said I'm not interested in balloon gloves and two-minute rounds but he said it was a real fight. I asked if it was 10 rounds or eight rounds - they said fine to eight," Hearn added. 

"They said 'the only thing is that Jake will weigh about 220lb (15st 10lb) or 225lb (16st 1lb) and we want AJ to come down in weight'.

"He's a heavyweight and hasn't cut weight before. They said, 'look we're not being funny and it's not that we need an advantage but we need you to have some disadvantage'."

Jake Paul's promoter Nakisa Bidarian says his fighter has a 'great shot' of beating Anthony Joshua

Paul, 28, holds a 12-1 professional record built mostly against limited or faded opposition, with his only defeat coming against Tommy Fury in 2023.

"People keep playing back old interviews where I said Jake Paul is average - I stand by that," Hearn said.

"He's improved a lot, but he's not a world-class fighter. He's maybe top 60 at cruiserweight. He trains properly and spars hard, but this is just different."

Despite criticism that the bout is a mismatch designed to deliver Joshua, 35, an easy payday, Hearn insists his fighter remains focused on long-term plans.

"This isn't 'we're fighting Jake Paul and retiring'. We've got massive plans for 2026," he said.

"We're going to have a run-out here, nick a career-high payday, and then go back into camp for serious stuff next year."

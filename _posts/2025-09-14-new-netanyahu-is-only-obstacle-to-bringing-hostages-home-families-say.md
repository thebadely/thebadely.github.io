Let's dive into the details: Families of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas have said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the "one obstacle" preventing their return and reaching a peace deal.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum: Bring Them Home Now wrote on social media that Israel's strike on Qatar last week shows "every time a deal approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it".

The group's comments come after Israel carried out a strike on senior Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital of Doha, which Hamas said killed five of it members and a Qatari security official.

On Saturday, Netanyahu said getting rid of Hamas leaders in Qatar "would rid the main obstacle" to releasing the hostages and ending the war.

He also accused Hamas of blocking all ceasefire attempts in order to drag out the war in Gaza.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio travelled to Israel on Saturday and is due to meet with Netanyahu as Israel faces global condemnation for the attack.

However, families of the hostages described the Israeli PM's response as "the latest excuse for failing to bring home" their loved ones.

"The targeted operation in Qatar proved beyond any doubt that there is one obstacle to returning the 48 hostages and ending the war: Prime Minister Netanyahu," they said.

"The time has come to end the excuses designed to buy time so he can cling to power."

The group added that Netanyahu's "stalling" had cost "the lives of 42 hostages and threatens the lives of additional hostages who are barely surviving".

Before his departure, Rubio said US President Donald Trump was not happy with the strike on Qatar, but stressed that the US-Israeli relationship was "very strong".

"Obviously we're not happy about it, the president was not happy about it. Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next," Rubio said.

He added that Trump's priority remains the return of all hostages and an end to the the war in Gaza.

When asked whether the strike on Doha complicates Qatar's willingness to work with the US, Rubio said "they've been good partners on a number of fronts".

Qatar is a key US ally in the region and the location of a major American air base.

In the wake of the strike, Qatar condemned Israel's attack as "cowardly" and a "flagrant violation of international law".

Netanyahu said the move was "fully justified" because it targeted senior Hamas leaders who organised the 7 October attacks.

Meanwhile, Israeli forces have stepped up their assault on Gaza City with a wave of heavy air strikes, reducing entire apartment blocks and large concrete structures to rubble.

Israel has also warned all residents in the region to leave immediately in anticipation of a huge ground offensive.

Residents said the Israeli military has been targeting schools and makeshift shelters, often issuing warnings only moments before bombardments.

On Saturday, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said about 250,000 people had left the city and moved south. 

Netanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City has drawn international criticism, with the UN warning a military escalation in an area where famine has been declared will push civilians into an "even deeper catastrophe".

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 64,605 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

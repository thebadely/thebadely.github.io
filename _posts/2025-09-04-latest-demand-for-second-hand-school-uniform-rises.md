Experts revealed that Charities and community groups have seen a rise in demand for second-hand school uniform.

Barnardo's in Frome has put out an appeal for donated uniform, due to the high demand they are seeing, and parents in Somerset have set up Facebook groups to help.

The Community Hub in Chard has started a pre-loved school uniform shop which operates on the basis of paying what you can afford to help parents who may not be able to afford it.

Tessa Goodridge-Reynolds, from the Chard Community Hub, said: "It's pay-as-you-can so there's no pressure to donate at all. We just want to remove that pressure. It's a really expensive time for parents."

Ms Goodridge-Reynolds helped to set up the uniform shop in 2022, led by the need from the community.

"They found it difficult to get hold of uniform cheaply," she said.

"Part of it is sustainability, too. Isn't it great if we can swap and share and get as much use out of clothes as possible?

"Today, more than 1,300 items have gone out to families. It's a busy time of year, everyone getting ready for school this week."

Nikki Allen, a mum from Somerset, set up the South Somerset School Uniform Exchange group on Facebook.

"It was a few years ago when my son was still in school. I was looking for bits of uniform that I didn't really want to buy new," Ms Allen said.

"There's posts every day, whether it's school uniform or coats. People are really pleased to get something for less money because of course budgets are tight still."

Barnardo's in Frome said they have also seen a surge in demand for uniform.

They have been recycling uniform for the last four years but demand is now is at its highest ever, with parents queuing up to get uniform and PE kits for their children.

Hannah Smith, the store manager, said: "There's been a lot more demand, I've had messages, phone calls asking for uniform. 

"It's definitely the cost of living, people just can't afford it new anymore and they're struggling.

"Just for a general Frome college uniform you're looking at Â£100, just for one set."

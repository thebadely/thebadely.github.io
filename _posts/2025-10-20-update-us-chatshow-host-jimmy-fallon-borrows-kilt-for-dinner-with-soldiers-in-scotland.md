Let's dive into the details: A kilt might not be the first thing on your list when you're a TV superstar packing for an autumnal holiday in Scotland.

But that's exactly what American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon was left scrambling for when he was unexpectedly invited to a black-tie dinner while on a trip to Aberdeenshire.

Luckily, his hotel's night manager was on hand to give him a loan of his own kilt.

The comedian was welcomed to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater by officers from the 5Scots regiment who served him Scotch eggs and Buckfast.

Fallon rose to fame as a cast member on the comedy sketch series Saturday Night Live before becoming the host of a late-night talk show.

Speaking about his trip, in a video shared on TikTok, Fallon said he travelled to Scotland to take a trip on the Royal Scotsman when he had a chance encounter with some soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

The comedian was visiting the River Dee near Balmoral Castle when some members of the King's royal guards, the 5Scots battalion, recognised him and invited him to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater for dinner.

The invitation, along with its black-tie dress code, left him with a dilemma - where to get a suit or a kilt, at such short notice.

He approached staff at the Fife Arms where he was staying who went the extra mile to help their guest.

Fallon said: "I called the night manager and I talked to him. I said 'I need to get a kilt tonight' and he goes 'I'll figure something out', so Muir gave me his own kilt."

The manager pieced together a full ensemble of kilt, jacket, sporran, hose and brogues.

The SNL actor said his hosts were "psyched" he wore a kilt and he "had the best dinner ever".

He dined on venison Scotch egg washed down with Buckfast tonic wine, which Fallon said had left him feeling a bit worse for wear.

He left the evening with his very own kilt, fitted by the battalion's tailor and a Glengarry hat he proudly wore during the video.

Major Thomas Blair, commanding officer of 5Scots, said: "What started as a chance meeting near Balmoral turned into a brilliant evening.

"It's not every day you get to meet a Hollywood A-lister, and we were delighted to welcome him to Scotland - in true Scots style."

Within 5Scots, Balaklava company has a number of ceremonial roles in Scotland and forms the royal guard at Balmoral.

The infantry company welcomed the King to Balmoral when he arrived for his summer residence earlier this year.

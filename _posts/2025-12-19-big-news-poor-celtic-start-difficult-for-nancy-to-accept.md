Scottish Premiership: Celtic v Aberdeen

Venue: Celtic Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 21 December Time: 15:00 GMT

Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland & Sounds, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app

Wilfried Nancy says Celtic's poor start on his managerial watch is "difficult to accept personally".

The Frenchman has lost all four of his opening games since being appointed this month.

These have included Scottish Premiership defeats by Hearts and Dundee United, a home loss to Roma in the Europa League and missing out on the Premier Sports Cup as St Mirren triumphed at Hampden.

"For sure, it's difficult, because I know what we can do," Nancy said. "I know what I can do also. But I know that, as a coach, we are judged on results.

"That's why this is difficult to accept personally, because I know that we are on the right track.

"And it's difficult for me. But, again, I'm going to take it."

Nancy has told his players, "I'm going to be in front of you because I have to do it".

And he added before Sunday's Premiership meeting with Aberdeen in Glasgow: "The fans are not happy, I'm going to take that.

"But I believe also that we can do better. And I think on Wednesday [against Dundee United] we were close to having a really good performance, but we didn't do better at the key moments.

"If you watch all the games that we play, all the time I adjusted something. On Wednesday, I think that what we did was interesting, with the way we attacked. And we had many opportunities. So the idea is not to stay still, we add improvements all the time.

"I have to change certain things to see players but also see how I can adjust a few players, how I can mix players together. And I think that, every game, I did that.

"My job is to still do it for the next game, and again, and again, and again. So that doesn't change."

It has been recently reported that The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, according to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

It is the first pill of its kind to receive approval from the regulator, marking a new era for weight-loss drugs.

Wegovy's Danish makers Novo Nordisk said the once-daily pill was a "convenient option" to the injectable and would provide the same weight loss as the shot. It comes after Wegovy was approved by the FDA specifically for weight loss.

Others like Ozempic, which has similar weight-loss effects, were primarily approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

The BBC has contacted the FDA for comment.

The Wegovy pill showed an average weight loss of 16.6% during Novo Nordisk's trials, the firm said on Monday.

A third of around 1,300 participants experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the same trial, it added.

The pill is expected to be launched in the US in early January 2026.

"Patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection," said Mike Doustdar, the firm's chief executive.

The pill version of Wegovy could give Novo Nordisk's sales a boost after a challenging year which saw its shares slide as it warned over its profits.

The company has faced intense competition in the weight-loss market from rival drugmakers like Eli Lilly.

Novo Nordisk's shares rose by almost 10% in after-hours trade in New York after the announcement.

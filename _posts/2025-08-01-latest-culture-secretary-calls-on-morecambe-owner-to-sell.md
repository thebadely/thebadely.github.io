It has been recently reported that Morecambe finished bottom of League Two last season

The culture secretary Lisa Nandy has written an open letter to Morecambe owner Jason Whittingham urging him to sell the club.

Earlier this week, the club were suspended by the National League for failing to comply with their rules and, on Thursday, prospective buyers Panjab Warriors said in a joint-statement with Morecambe 's minority shareholders that the club would shut on Monday without a takeover.

Nandy said the incoming football regulator would look to stop situations like this arising again but "will not be up and running in time to help Morecambe today".

Describing Morecambe's plight as "heartbreaking" and "critical", she said: "It is imperative that you act and get round the table to do so."

BBC Radio Lancashire have contacted Whittingham for comment.

Neil Wainwright, Morecambe's academy manager, speaks to BBC Radio Lancashire

In the most recent statement from Whittingham on Sunday, he said owners Bond Group Investments were ready to sell and urged Panjab Warriors to make contact.

The sports investment company, who have been in talks to purchase the club for more than a year, released a statement on Tuesday which said they remain "ready, willing and able" to take over.

Morecambe's suspension by the National League remains in place until the league's compliance and licensing committee meets again on 20 August.

Despite the club's difficulties, academy manager Neil Wainwright has said that the Shrimps' academy has not ceased operating, and described the situation as being "paused".

Wainwright, who has been at the club for 17 years, told BBC Radio Lancashire that he had fielded calls from other clubs enquiring about their youth players, but that the club retained almost all of their registrations until the committee meets again.

"The case is that we're pausing activities until the club is sold or we know what is going on," he said.

"Come 20 August that could be a different story completely. [But] it's an academy pause rather than an academy close.

"There's been quite a few other clubs who think it's an academy close who've been contacting me about players. However the situation is currently, we're still hoping against hope the club can be sold and get back to normal."

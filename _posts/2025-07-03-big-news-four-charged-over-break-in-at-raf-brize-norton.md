It has been recently reported that Four people have been charged by counter-terrorism police over a break-in at RAF Brize Norton last month, during which military planes were damaged.

Damage worth £7m was caused to two Voyager aircraft at the Oxfordshire base on 20 June after they were sprayed with red paint.

Four suspects aged between 22 and 35 are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court later on Thursday.

Counter Terrorism Policing South East said they had been charged with conspiracy to commit criminal damage, and conspiracy to enter a prohibited place knowingly for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK .

A group called Palestine Action said it was behind the incident.

The four people due to appear in court are: 

A 41-year-old woman previously arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender was released on bail until 19 September.

Another man was released without charge.

In a statement, police said the Crown Prosecution service will argue in court that the alleged offences had a "terrorist connection".

On Wednesday, MPs voted to ban Palestine Action under anti-terror legislation.

The move passed by 385 votes to 26 after being proposed by the government.

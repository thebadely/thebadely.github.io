Alex Scott has had a wide-ranging football and broadcast career

Scott grew up in London and signed for Arsenal in 1992 at the age of eight.

A right-back, she stayed with the Gunners until 2004, when she joined Birmingham City for one season before returning to Arsenal.

Scott spent two years with US side Boston Breakers between 2009 and 2011 in the newly formed Women's Professional Soccer league - making 55 appearances.

She returned to Arsenal in 2011 for a third and final stint before retiring from club football at the end of the 2017-18 season.

Scott won 22 trophies during her time at Arsenal, including scoring the winning goal in the 2007 Uefa Women's Cup final.

She played for England at under-19 and under-21 levels before her senior debut in September 2004 - and scored 12 goals in her 140 international appearances. She was part of the squad that finished runners-up in the 2009 Women's Euros, and gained a bronze medal at the 2015 Women's World Cup.

She also finished fifth at the 2012 Olympics in London as part of Team GB.

Scott was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2019, followed by the WSL Hall of Fame in 2024. She was made an MBE in 2017 for her services to football.

While playing, Scott completed a degree in professional sports writing and broadcasting at the University of Staffordshire.

After retiring, she became a full-time broadcaster, becoming the BBC's first female pundit at a men's World Cup when she covered the 2018 tournament in Russia.

Scott also became the first female pundit on Sky Sports in 2018 when she joined Super Sunday.

Away from football, Scott came fifth in the 2019 series of Strictly Come Dancing. She also covered the Tokyo Olympics with the BBC.

Scott continues to be the main presenter for Football Focus, having replaced Dan Walker in 2021.

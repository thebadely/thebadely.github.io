Experts revealed that When Scotland's men last qualified for the World Cup in 1998, Believe by Cher was the bestselling song of the year, Tony Blair was the UK's prime minister and a pint of milk cost about 34p.

Tens of thousands of Scots made the trip across the Channel by planes, trains and automobiles to back Craig Brown's squad.

Now, 27 years later, Tartan Army footsoldiers have been telling their stories ahead of the crucial match against Denmark which could see Scotland end the long wait and qualify for next year's finals.

Ian Stephen from Perthshire was 28 when he embarked on a road trip to Paris with four friends to see Scotland play in the tournament's opening match against Brazil on 10 June 1998. 

He sold his car and bought a 1979 VW campervan to get across the Channel.

"The guys piled in to the van and we had flags and stickers on the side. We got the ferry to France and had an absolute blast.

"It was just fans of all nationalities mixing and having a brilliant time," he said.

The group made it round France to all three Scotland games in the van - although not without a snapped clutch cable and a faulty spark plug along the way.

Instead of cash, they paid mechanics with wine for the repairs in a bid to keep the trip under budget.

Henry Hepburn from Falkirk was also among those who made it to Paris for the opening game against Brazil.

He sat his final exam at Glasgow University, ironically a French speaking test, on the day the World Cup was due to kick off.

Then aged 23, Henry persuaded his university lecturers to give him the first available appointment that morning to sit the exam.

He then rushed to the airport to catch his flight to Paris, where he was planning to watch the game with the other fans who weren't lucky enough to have a ticket for the match.

The big opener was the only Scotland fixture he didn't have a ticket for, so he headed to the fan zone in the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville to watch the action on a big screen. He got there just in time.

"I had a friend waiting outside to dash to the airport and then we got to the big square in the centre of Paris literally at the moment that Scotland got awarded a penalty. 

"It was just amazing to see that moment, it just went wild," he said.

John Collins scored the spot-kick to level the score at 1-1 against Brazil, giving fans the belief that an upset could be on the cards against the defending World Cup champions.

Henry - who says he didn't have the "luxury" of a campervan to stay in during his stay - made his way around France, even sleeping in someone's back garden in Bordeaux, as hotel rooms were hard to find and kind locals offered their outdoor space to campers.

Being in France was one thing, but getting a ticket to Scotland's opening match was like "gold dust", according to Kevyn Whitelaw, from Stirling.

He was also 23 when he was lucky enough to make it inside the Stade de France in Saint Denis for that game.

Kevyn went to all of Scotland's France '98 matches, but that first one -which his dad Graham was able to join him for - was special.

Despite Scotland ultimately losing 2-1 to Brazil, the day holds nothing but positive memories for him.

"My dad and I were lucky enough to get a ticket in the ballot, where you had to write and apply for the tickets back in the day," said Kevyn.

His dad, Graham, called in sick from work to get to the game with his son, and opted to wear a disguise in case he was caught by one of the TV cameras during the match. 

The memory of his dad in sunglasses, with a tartan hat and wig, still makes 51-year-old Kevyn laugh.

Looking back, he says the biggest shock of all was the cost of his match day ticket.

"A category four ticket for the bit where most of the Scotland fans were was £22 and £4 postage.

"It's just the idea of getting to the opening match of a World Cup now for £26... it was incredible when you think about it."

In the end, Scotland exited the 1998 tournament at the group stages after two defeats and one draw.

The men's team have failed to qualify for the tournament since.

Kevin Donnelly, a loyal Tartan Army footsoldier from Edinburgh, can remember a time when Scotland were regularly competing on the world stage. 

Over the years, he has followed the team to four World Cups and four Euros. 

The 64-year-old wasn't willing to disclose just how much he had spent as a travelling supporter over the years, but says he will "definitely" be going to North America if Scotland make it to the 2026 World Cup.

His memories of France include bumping into singer Rod Stewart in Bordeaux. He then travelled to the Sporting Club in Monaco after the World Cup to collect an award on behalf of the Tartan Army.

It recognised the good behaviour of the Scotland supporters who had followed their team to France.

Kevin is "optimistic" that he will see Scotland go through to the World Cup next year. 

Steve Clarke's side must win against Denmark to qualify automatically for the tournament and avoid the play-offs.

Kevin said: "We're in a much better positions than we expected at the start of the qualifiers.

"If you'd have offered us this position at the start we'd have bitten your hand off. We are still in control of our own destiny and not relying on other results."

He said that for some of the squad, this would represent the last chance to get to a World Cup and the team needed to sieze the opportinity.

"You sometimes think we are a nation of dreamers when it comes to football. Let's dare to dream."

Scotland play Denmark at Hampden on Tuesday 12 November at 19:45.

You can watch Scotland v Denmark on BBC Scotland, BBC Two and iPlayer from 19:15 GMT.

It has been recently reported that At least one person has died and dozens have been injured after a train collided with a slurry tanker and derailed in southern Denmark, officials have said. 

Police said the crash occurred between the towns of Tinglev and Kliplev in southern Jutland, near the German border, leaving a 60-year-old woman dead and 27 others injured.

In an update shortly after midnight, police said a crane was being used at the site to lift some of the damaged carriages to ensure there were no more injured passengers.

Of the five people seriously injured, two remained in a critical condition in hospital.

Local media reported the train as having hit a slurry tanker, which are used to transport farm waste.

Pictures from the scene showed a carriage lying on its side, with passengers standing around the train tracks. 

Police said 106 people in total had been involved in the accident. Among the passengers onboard included pupils from a school in nearby SÃ¸nderborg, the train's intended destination.

None of the students or the two teachers with them were seriously injured, police said, but they had been invited to go into school on Saturday to talk to a psychologist.

"My thoughts go out to the relatives, the many injured and everyone who is currently affected by the accident," Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement to public broadcaster DR.

"I hope that everyone gets the best possible help and support."

The country's rail operator DSB said that it had shut down services along the line until further notice.

The national rail agency Banedanmark wrote on X that the collision happened at a level crossing. At least two of the train carriages were derailed, according to local media.

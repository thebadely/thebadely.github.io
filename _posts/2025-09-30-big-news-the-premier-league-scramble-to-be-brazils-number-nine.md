Let's dive into the details: Richarlison is likely to be in Brazil's squad for next summer's World Cup - unless some Premier League rivals usurp him

Pele. Ronaldo. Romario. Jairzinho. The list could go on.

Brazil has been blessed with great goalscorers throughout their footballing history, players who have fired them to a record five World Cup wins.

Now the race is on for the striker to lead their line at this summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

While the likes of Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo, Raphinha and Willian Estevao - even potentially the return of Neymar - provide exciting attacking options, the battle for the number nine shirt appears very much open.

And - with eight contenders playing in the Premier League - what happens in England over the coming months is likely to have a huge impact as Brazil bid to end their 24-year wait for the trophy.

Brentford's Igor Thiago is the joint second top scorer in the Premier League with four goals, while Tottenham's Richarlison has three and Chelsea's Joao Pedro has netted twice. 

Igor Jesus, meanwhile, has netted four times for Nottingham Forest in cup matches.

Richarlison and Pedro are the two most likely to be named in Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti's squad on Wednesday for their latest World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday.

BBC Sport looks at some of the striker candidates he will be following this season, with the majority of them from the Premier League.

Richarlison joined Tottenham from Everton for Â£60m in 2022

Tottenham forward Richarlison, 28, has scored 20 goals in 52 caps for Brazil - only behind Neymar (79) among World Cup candidates.

He started their recent World Cup qualifier defeat by Bolivia - but was a substitute against Chile.

He has scored three Premier League goals for Spurs this season.

Joao Pedro, 24, will hope his summer move to Chelsea can launch his Brazil career.

This is his debut campaign in the Champions League after spells at Fluminense, Watford and Brighton.

He is yet to score after five caps - but featured in both recent qualifiers.

Matheus Cunha joined United for Â£62.5m from Wolves this summer

Matheus Cunha, 26, will need a good season at Manchester United to seal a regular spot starting for Brazil.

Last season's 17-goal haul for Wolves was the best of his career.

He has only netted once - in a 4-1 defeat by Argentina - in his 15 caps to date.

Bournemouth striker Evanilson, 25, has played just twice for Brazil so far - and is yet to score.

He netted 10 Premier League goals for the Cherries last season, but has dropped out of the Champions League where he played regularly for Porto.

Igor Jesus has scored four goals in his first two cup starts for Forest

Nottingham Forest frontman Igor Jesus, 24, is another who is relying on taking the Premier League by storm to earn a Brazil spot.

He moved to England this summer from Botafogo in his homeland, having previously played in the United Arab Emirates.

He has netted four goals in his first two starts for Forest, against Swansea and Real Betis.

Jesus has scored once in four Brazil caps to date.

Can Gabriel Jesus get fit and stay fit?

The 28-year-old Arsenal forward has not played since January because of an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

He has scored 19 goals in 64 caps for Brazil and would certainly be on the plane if he can recover from injury and rediscover his form.

However, he was left out of the Gunners' Champions League squad, indicating a return is not imminent.

Rodrigo Muniz's seven goals as a sub since the start of last season are more than any other player in the Premier League

Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz, 24, is yet to feature in a senior Brazil squad and is uncapped at any youth level.

He needs to first dislodge Raul Jimenez from the Cottagers team and then bag enough goals to catch Ancelotti's eye.

Like Muniz, Brentford's Igor Thiago is a London-based uncapped 24-year-old.

Thiago missed the majority of last season through injury - but has already scored five goals this season, including a double against Manchester United on Saturday.

Keep this form up and he might be impossible for Ancelotti to ignore.

Vitor Roque is back in Brazil with Palmeiras after one year in Spain with Barcelona and Real Betis (on loan)

Vitor Roque, 20, won his one and only Brazil cap back in 2023.

That was the summer he signed an eight-year deal with Barcelona. 

He left the club after one season and is now back in Brazil with Palmeiras.

Marcos Leonardo, 22, has made a big impact at Saudi club Al-Hilal.

He was the joint top scorer at the Fifa Club World Cup with four goals, including two in their win over Manchester United.

Leonardo is yet to make his senior Brazil debut.

Endrick missed the Club World Cup and the start of the La Liga campaign through injury

Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick, 19, will hope to be a big part of the Brazilian squad next summer.

He has scored three goals in 14 games for Brazil - including one against England when he became the youngest goalscorer at Wembley ever, aged 17.

But he missed the start of this season with a hamstring injury.

According to new developments, Lucas Paqueta is keen to head home to Brazil, sources say

Flamengo are exploring the possibility of loaning Lucas Paqueta back to West Ham in an effort to seal a move for the Brazil international this month.

BBC Sport reported this week the attacker was the subject of interest from at least two clubs in his native country.

One of those clubs is Flamengo, who are prepared to pay about Â£35m for the attacker.

Sources indicate Paqueta is pushing to leave, but the Hammers are reluctant to let him go given they face a relegation battle.

However, it is understood they would consider letting Paqueta join Flamengo during the transfer window, provided the 28-year-old is loaned back until the end of the season.

Sources claim discussions to that affect have been held between the clubs.

The Brazilian top flight does not start until March, which could - in theory - clear the way for such a deal.

But any agreement for Paqueta to stay in London until the final game of the season in May could depend on how far adrift West Ham are from safety.

They are currently seven points adrift of Nottingham Forest, who occupy 17th place.

Paqueta missed last weekend's FA Cup third-round win over Queens Park Rangers, which sparked claims from insiders that he did not make himself available because he wants to leave.

However, club sources insist Paqueta's absence was down to a minor injury.

It now remains to be seen whether Paqueta is selected to play against Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday.

West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo says the club need to find an answer quickly.

Speaking on Thursday, he told reporters: "We always want our best players to be involved and Lucas is one of our best players, so let's try to solve the situation.

"It's a solution that we have to find. Us as a club, the player, myself."

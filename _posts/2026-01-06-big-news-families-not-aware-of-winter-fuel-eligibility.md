It has been recently reported that The Guernsey Community Foundation believes some islanders do not know they are eligible to receive financial support to help pay their heating bills.

The Winter Fuel Allowance is a weekly payment of up to £42.42. from the States of Guernsey, intended to support low-income families to pay for heating during the colder months.

Chief executive Jim Roberts said: "I know there are families out there that are struggling with the cost, and they will not be aware that there is a support system in place."

The Committee for Employment & Social Security has been contacted for comment.

A survey the Guernsey Community Foundation carried out last year found 5% of islanders often go without essentials like heating or food.

Roberts said: "Whether you're renting a place or you own a place, you have to pay the bills to heat that place."

"There is a persistent stereotype about winter fuel costs - you tend to call to mind an older couple or a pensioner couple," he added.

"But it's not just a problem which pensioners face."

The Winter Fuel Allowance can be paid to all eligible householders receiving Income Support.

At the Age Concern Centre at St Martin's Parish Hall, Leslie, said "If I qualified for it I'd use it, but I don't think I do."

Meanwhile, Maggie said: "We don't feel we need it enough. I feel other people need it more than we do."

Gareth Wordingham, customer product and innovation lead at Guernsey Electricity, said: "If you've got a problem with affordability do give us a call, we'd much rather help you than have you sitting at home shivering."

He also offered some tips on how to keep heating costs low.

Wordingham said: "If you've got a small heater, they're cheap to buy but they can be really expensive to run, so if you're not in the room that they're being used in, make sure you turn them off.

"Make sure you've got rid of any drafts and and the curtains are tucked behind the radiators so that the heat comes into the room and isn't trapped between the wall and the curtains."

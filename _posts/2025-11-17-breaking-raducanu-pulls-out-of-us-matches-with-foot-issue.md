According to new developments, Emma Raducanu is making plans for 2026 with coach Francisco Roig

Emma Raducanu has pulled out of two exhibition matches in the United States next month because of a minor foot issue.

The British number one has light bone bruising in her right foot, but she is able to practise and is soon expecting to travel to Barcelona for a pre-season training block.

Preparations for next season will be overseen in Spain by coach Francisco Roig, who began working with Raducanu in August.

The 23-year-old Raducanu has spent part of this month training at the National Tennis Centre in London and will now be able to focus entirely on the overseas camp.

Not having to play two exhibition matches nearly a month before the start of the new season is a way of reducing the load on her foot.

Raducanu also has a new physiotherapist, Emma Stewart, who used to work for the WTA Tour before joining the men's squad at British Rowing.

Stewart will travel to some events next year and, in the short term, also take control of Raducanu's strength and conditioning programme.

Why did Raducanu visit England's camp?

Rating Raducanu's season - and what does future hold?

Raducanu is preparing to represent Great Britain, alongside Jack Draper, at the United Cup in the first week of the new year.

GB will play Japan and Greece in the group stage in Perth, which means Raducanu can look forward to a singles meeting with her fellow Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.

As the current world number 29, Raducanu is in line to be seeded for the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on 18 January.

The 2021 US Open champion withdrew from her final two events of this season because of illness but was still able to record a career-high 28 tour-level victories.

Meanwhile, the world number six Jessica Pegula will replace Raducanu in the exhibition matches in Newark and Miami on 7 and 8 December.

Men's world number one Carlos Alcaraz is also appearing and will take on American Frances Tiafoe and 19-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca over the two nights.

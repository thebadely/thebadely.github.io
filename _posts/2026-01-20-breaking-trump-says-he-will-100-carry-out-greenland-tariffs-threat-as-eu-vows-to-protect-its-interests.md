Let's dive into the details: Donald Trump has vowed to "100%" follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries who oppose his demand to take control of Greenland.

European allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for "Greenlanders and for the Danes alone" to decide.

On Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries.

In a post to Truth Social in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the US president said he had a "very good telephone call" with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and agreed to a meeting "of various parties" in Switzerland this week.

He went on: "Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back — On that, everyone agrees!"

Trump has said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff "on any and all goods" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.

He said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949.

Asked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Trump told NBC News: "I will, 100%."

When the outlet asked whether he would use force to seize the territory, the president replied "no comment".

Trump added: "Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland."

Denmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic.

However, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies.

Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were "not the way forward".

"We have red lines that can't be crossed," he told Sky News. "You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation."

Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the tariffs did not benefit anyone, and he hoped to meet with the US president during his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum. 

He said: "We do not want this escalation. We do not want a trade dispute with the United States of America."

He also added that the Trump administration would not have been surprised by Nato's so-called reconnaissance mission over the weekend, as it had been announced and agreed upon beforehand. 

"It was never a military action," the German chancellor said.

The European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has "no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground".

"But trades threats are not the way to go about this," Kallas added. "Sovereignty is not for trade."

It comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday the US president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize.

In his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.

"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter," Støre added.

Trump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: "Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say.

"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it."

Meanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) on Monday announced that multiple aircraft are on their way to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. 

The joint US-Canada military defence organisation stressed they are part of a routine operation "to support various long-planned Norad activities", and said they had been  coordinated with Denmark and that the government of Greenland had been informed.

Similar Norad operations at the base took place in 2022, 2023, and last year.

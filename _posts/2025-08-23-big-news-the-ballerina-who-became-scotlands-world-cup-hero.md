Marvellous McGhie completes hat-trick as Scotland extend lead over Wales

Francesca McGhie has suggested that when she made her Scotland debut in 2023 she "didn't really know how to play rugby". 

After a stunning Women's Rugby World Cup debut, it's fair to say the 22-year-old winger is getting the hang of it pretty quickly.

A wonderful hat-trick of tries by McGhie helped Scotland dismantle Wales and take control of their own destiny in Pool B, with games against Fiji and Canada to come.

Beat Fiji - the lowest ranked team in their group - next Saturday and they will almost certainly reach the knockout stages after delivering a complete team performance against the Welsh.

Amid arguably Scotland's best display in many years, it was McGhie who stole the show.

"I'd like to think that that performance was better than my first cap," she told BBC Scotland.

Rugby union was not McGhie's first love. 

Dancing was her passion, and her talents as a ballet and contemporary dancer earned her a place at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.

That nimble footwork would serve her well in her ultimate calling as a rugby player, but it was not until 2018 that she took up the game, as a 15-year-old.

She joined Watsonians the following year and helped the club to the Premiership title in 2023.

She received her first Scotland call-up that same year, announcing herself in the Test arena with a stunning solo try in a victory over Ireland, which led to a nomination for World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year award.

McGhie has proved herself to be a player for the big occasion. 

She came up with a last-gasp match-winning try against Ireland in this year's Six Nations, and her hat-trick against Wales took her international try-scoring record to 13 in 23 games.

"When you put Fran McGhie in space, what a finisher," Scotland head coach Bryan Easson told BBC Scotland after Saturday's win.

"I'd said to her this morning she'll get a couple of scores, but I said to her at half-time, 'come on, that's not enough'.

"One-on-one, I don't think there's anybody better in the world. She's a world-class finisher without a doubt."

Scotland praise for the hat-trick of tries hero

Captain Rachel Malcolm: "She is probably going to be - if she's not already - one of the best wingers with ball in hand. She's so evasive and just an incredible athlete. 

"I think today she stamped her mark on this tournament, she stamped her mark on the world stage and I can't wait to see what she's got to come."

Evie Gallagher: "She's ridiculous. I think Francesca's one that's been building since her first Six Nations.

"She put out performance after performance then, and to see her grow in her first World Cup, I'm just so excited to see what she brings to the next few games because she's something worth talking about."

Emma Orr: "She's just amazing. She makes my job so easy. I think she's had a couple of injuries over pre-season, but to have her out there and a hat-trick on the opening game, I'm just so, so chuffed for her.

"She works so hard, but off the pitch, she's the kindest, funniest person and is always there for everyone. So I'm just so happy for her and cannot wait to see her keep smashing it in this World Cup."

Former Scotland lock Deborah McCormack on BBC One: "She's on fire. She's absolutely unreal. She's critical for Scotland. 

"That centre partnership, that's key - them fixing their defence, manipulating the space so that there is that space to exploit for Fran. She's all over it."

Former Wales lock Siwan Lillicrap on BBC One: "She's been outstanding, hasn't she? McGhie's a world-class finisher. 

"Not any player can score a hat-trick in a World Cup opening game with so much pressure on it. 

"I've always been a big fan of McGhie. She also creates opportunities as well as that finishing."

Former Scotland international Lisa Martin on BBC Radio 5 Live: You give Fran McGhie a one-on-one and it's always going to end in a try."

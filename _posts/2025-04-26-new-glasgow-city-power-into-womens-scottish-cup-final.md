Glasgow City cruise to Women's Scottish Cup final

Glasgow City booked their place in the Women's Scottish Cup final by overcoming Motherwell's initial stubbornness to win 4-0 at Hampden.

Sofia Maatta and Nicole Kozlova scored in the first half and Katie Lockwood added two more after the break as the nine-time winners booked a return to the national stadium to face either holders Rangers or Aberdeen on 25 May.

Underdogs Well frustrated City for more than half an hour, but Glasgow's pressure told when Emily Whelan escaped Emma Lawton and crossed for Maatta to tap into an empty net.

Maatta then unselfishly set up Kozlova, who rounded Emily Mutch to finish in first-half stoppage time.

Kozlova had moments earlier watched in frustration as she nudged the ball past Mutch, only for Jenna Penman to hack clear on the goal line. Kozlova also shot tamely at Mutch at 0-0 and Whelan headed wide before setting up the opener.

Whelan was the provider for Lockwood's second-half strike, laying the ball across for an emphatic finish.

Maatta was denied a second by Mutch soon after and Brenna Lovera netted from an offside position at a corner as the City onslaught continued. Replays suggested Lovera may in fact have been onside.

Samantha van Diemen's excellent long ball was met with an equally good first touch by Lockwood and the midfielder kept her cool to beat Mutch once again.

Motherwell did well to contain City for spells but struggled to create openings of their own.

However, their achievements in securing a SWPL top-six finish and reaching the last four of the Scottish Cup give them cause for optimism for next season.

Rangers meet Aberdeen in Sunday's semi-final at Hampden (14:10 BST), with the match live on BBC Alba, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Glasgow City head coach Leanne Ross: "It was a comfortable performance. Our patterns of play came out and the individual quality we have throughout the team shone. All in all, really pleased with the performance and result.

"I loved lifting silverware as a player. It's no different as a manager but it's all about the players. It's about them getting their hands on the trophy, so they've done the hard work getting themselves into the final and we can go and look forward to that."

Motherwell manager Paul Brownlie: "At 1-0, we still had control without the ball. We had a good structure about us, defensively we were sound at points in the game but the second goal almost kills the game.

"That's two visits to Hampden in three years, which is an incredible achievement for a club like Motherwell, it's about growing and getting better. 

"It's still pretty raw and we don't want to lose games, but I've got to think of the bigger picture."

Let's dive into the details: A senior midwife leading the largest maternity review in NHS history has said she would be prepared to expand her work to other parts of England.

Donna Ockenden, who is chairing a review into maternity failings in Nottingham, said on Thursday she had the backing from families in the city to take on a similar role investigating Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

But a short time later Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4 Ms Ockenden would not lead the Leeds review due to her existing commitments in Nottingham and Shrewsbury and Telford.

Families in Leeds have previously said they would like Ms Ockenden to take on the role, but the decision lies with Streeting.

Hundreds of babies have died or been injured while under the care of Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, which runs maternity departments at City Hospital and the Queen's Medical Centre.

The units, which are currently rated by the health watchdog as requires improvement, remain the focus of the largest inquiry of its kind with about 2,500 cases being examined.

In June, Streeting announced a national investigation into maternity care in England, with victims of scandals such as Nottingham set to be involved.

Ms Ockenden said she had discussed the issue with bereaved families in Nottingham and said she "felt confident" there was a way that she could take on more without impacting the work she has done so far.

She said she would be willing to chair the inquiry in Leeds and a maternity review at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, describing it as an "honour" to be considered.

The BBC has been told families in Nottingham are supportive of Ms Ockenden leading other reviews.

"We have to learn in this country that families shouldn't have to fight as hard to get the answers that they deserve," she said.

"We saw that at the start of the Nottingham review and we saw it in Shrewsbury and Telford, it's not good enough. 

"It's always an honour and a privilege when families trust in me and say they want me but it is not my decision, it's for the secretary of state."

She said nine families had been in contact with Streeting and asked for her to take on a review of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust - which has maternity units in Brighton, Chichester, Haywards Heath and Worthing. 

Asked about calls for her to take on this work, she said: "Again the sentiments are the same, it's an honour to be trusted by families, it is not my decision but there are ways it can be made to work.

"My promise, and I've discussed this in-depth with Nottingham families and MPs, is it will not impact the quality or timeline for their review."

Streeting said he was aware families in Leeds had told him recently it was "Donna or bust".

"She won't be leading the Leeds inquiry, not least because she's leading the work in Nottingham, Shrewsbury and Telford," he said.

"If I could clone her, I would but because Donna has earned the trust of the families she is working with, everyone wants Donna, I understand that and I have huge respect for her. 

"But I've got to make sure to protect the work Donna is already doing but I've also got to build a wider team of people who can support the government, support the NHS when trouble arises."

Streeting said the government was "drawing up a potential list" of candidates to chair the review in Leeds.

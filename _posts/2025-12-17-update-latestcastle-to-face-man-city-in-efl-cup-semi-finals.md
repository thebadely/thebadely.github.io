Experts revealed that Eddie Howe's Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-1 in last year's final

Holders Newcastle United will face eight-time winners Manchester City in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup.

Chelsea will either meet Arsenal or Crystal Palace in the other two-legged last-four tie but must wait until Tuesday 23 December to find out which of their London rivals it will be.

The Gunners' quarter-final match against the Eagles was rescheduled to prevent Oliver Glasner's Palace side playing three matches in five days because of their involvement in the Europa Conference League on Thursday.

The first legs of the semi-finals take place in the week commencing 12 January 2026 with the second-leg fixtures in the week beginning 2 February.

Chelsea were runners-up to Liverpool in both 2022 and 2024, last winning the trophy in 2015.

Manchester City won the trophy for a fourth-consecutive time in 2021 but have not reached the last four since while the Magpies beat Liverpool in March to win a first domestic trophy in 70 years.

According to new developments, Northern Ireland finished third in their World Cup qualifying group but advanced to the play-offs via the Nations League

Wales head coach Craig Bellamy has warned against writing off potential World Cup play-off opponents Northern Ireland.

The teams could meet in a play-off final in Cardiff in March, but only if Wales win their semi-final at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Northern Ireland progress from theirs with an against-the-odds victory in Italy.

The prize on offer for the play-off final winners will be a place at next summer's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, in Group B alongside Canada, Switzerland and Qatar.

Four-time World Cup champions Italy are the favourites but, having missed out on the previous two editions of the competition in Qatar and Russia, the Azzurri will be under severe pressure to qualify this time.

"Everyone thinks it'll be Italy we'll have to play if we beat Bosnia, but if there's one team that's happy not to have the ball it's them [Northern Ireland]," said Bellamy.

"I think they're ranked 48th of 54 teams in Europe for possession. They know where they're going and... they were the one team I didn't want to play.

"Everyone's writing them off but, I'm telling you now, watch out for that result - it's not going to be straightforward. It will be a tough, tough game for Italy."

Bellamy hopes to renew feud with Canada's Marsch

Northern Ireland learn possible World Cup opponents

Northern Ireland are 69th in the Fifa world rankings, 57 places below Italy and 27 adrift of Wales, but two spots above Bosnia.

Michael O'Neill's side finished third behind Germany and Slovakia in the World Cup qualifying group but secured their play-off place thanks to their Nations League success.

Italy, Wales and Bosnia all finished second in their groups, behind Norway, Belgium and Austria respectively.

Northern Ireland are looking to qualify for their first major tournament since Euro 2016, when they were knocked out in the second round by a Wales side who went on to reach the semi-finals under Chris Coleman.

O'Neill was in the midst of his first, nine-year spell in charge of Northern Ireland at the time and is now three years into his second stint as his country's manager.

"Down the years they've just had something and they know what they are. They've got a brilliant manager who I really like," Bellamy added.

"I was lucky enough to spend a bit of time with him as well, and I loved him. No wonder his players do well. They won't be playing at their home ground [against Italy], but I just feel they'll be comfortable in any situation you throw them into.

"There will be pressure coming on Italy because they haven't qualified for two World Cups. If I was Italy going into that game, with everyone expecting you to win, I'm telling you I'd be edgy. I wouldn't be comfortable with it.

"Italy is one of the greatest nations in football and that's a lot of responsibility to shoulder. To have to play a team like Northern Ireland, I'd just be thinking let's get through this and see what happens in the other game."

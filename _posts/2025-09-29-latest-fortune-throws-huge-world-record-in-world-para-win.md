Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sabrina Fortune won gold at the 2024 Paralympics in Paris

Sabrina Fortune threw a huge new world record as she won gold in the women's shot put F20 at the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi.

Fortune, 28, now has four world titles to her name as well as Paralympic gold from Paris 2024.

Fortune set a world record in Paris of 15.12m, before extending it to 15.75m in Birmingham last month.

She smashed that in India with a huge first throw of 16.75m, winning gold by nearly three metres.

She told BBC Sport: "After the first throw that was loads of fun!

"I wasn't expecting that much, we were hoping for around 16m. I wanted another world record but it's never guaranteed.

"I have a learning disability and it takes me a long time to learn new things, there are days when I can't focus, my brain is turned off.

"But India has been amazing, I am learning the culture and the language."

Melanie Woods also won her first global medal with bronze in the women's 800m T54.

She said: "I am super proud. I have raced well this season and was confident of a medal, I see these girls as beatable now."

Scot Woods is also competing in the 400m and 1500m this week. 

Entry is free throughout the championships, which started on Saturday and run until Sunday, 5 October.

Here’s what you need to know: Darwin Nunez scored seven goals from 47 Liverpool appearances last season

Darwin Nunez reached the end of his Liverpool career as the Uruguayan striker joined Al-Hilal on a three-year contract on Saturday.

The Saudi Pro League side secured a deal worth 53m euros (Â£46.3m) for the 26-year-old.

Nunez joined Liverpool in June 2022 from Portuguese side Benfica for an initial fee of Â£64m, arriving amid high expectations.

He scored 40 goals in 143 appearances for the Reds but only started eight Premier League games during their title-winning campaign last season.

A Liverpool statement read: "Everybody at the club would like to thank Darwin for his contributions and wish him and his family all the best for the future."

Nunez has joined the Al-Hilal squad on their pre-season training camp in Germany.

His departure may have an effect on Liverpool's pursuit of Sweden striker Alexander Isak, with Newcastle having turned down an opening offer of Â£110m.

Nunez leaves Liverpool having been unable to reach the heights it was hoped he would following his big-money move from Benfica.

There were moments of euphoria that will be fondly remembered by many on Merseyside: his late double to give 10-man Liverpool victory at Newcastle in August 2023, a 99th-minute winner against Nottingham Forest in March 2024 and two added-time goals against Brentford in January of this year, which helped to ensure Nunez leaves England as a Premier League winner.

However, there will be differing opinions over whether that is enough to override the frustration felt by many over his inconsistency in making such contributions - which convinced Liverpool head coach Arne Slot to seek other options.

Nunez missed this close-range chance against Newcastle last December

The man referred to as 'Captain Chaos' by ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher struggled to hold down a regular starting role throughout his three seasons at Anfield.

After scoring 15 goals from 42 games in all competitions in his first season, his tally increased to 18 from 54 during his second, but Nunez was used less often after Slot succeeded Jurgen Klopp in 2024.

He scored just seven times from 47 appearances last term and, in all, managed 25 goals from 95 Premier League games, although 46 of those appearances came as a substitute.

Darwin Nunez's first three games for Liverpool were a sign of what was to come

Nunez's latest transfer fee is significantly less than the Â£85m package - including add-ons, of which not all were activated - that was required to sign him in 2022.

He signed a six-year deal on the back of a 2021-22 campaign in which he scored 34 times in 41 appearances for Benfica, including twice in Champions League matches against Liverpool.

Klopp warned it was important for the club and supporters to recognise that Nunez was a "work in progress", as evidenced in his first few appearances when he scored in back-to-back games but was sent off on his home debut for headbutting Fulham's Joachim Andersen.

The late interventions from Nunez which endeared him to supporters sporadically hinted at his latent talent, and were also a theme of his stay.

However, having fallen out of favour towards the end of Klopp's reign, a summer 2025 exit appeared increasingly likely when Slot criticised Nunez's work-rate after the forward allowed a poor miss to affect the rest of his performance against Aston Villa in February.

"Players miss chances - that I can accept," Slot said. "What was a bit harder for me to accept was his behaviour after that chance, and by behaviour I mean it got too much in his head, where he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his butt off and makes sure he helps the team."

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot discusses Darwin Nunez

Nunez, whose game is underpinned by energy and enthusiasm, ended the season having made just eight league starts, scoring five goals.

His exit comes after Liverpool's signings of French forward Hugo Ekitike for Â£79m and club-record Â£116m playmaker Florian Wirtz this window, as Slot rebuilds the team before his second season.

Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, The Redmen TV's Dan Clubbe said: "The overriding feeling is frustration. [Nunez] came in for a lot of money and there was a lot of expectation around him.

"Given the money we spent on him, he probably has come some way short of what we expected, so [a move] probably is best for both parties."

It is Nunez's statistics in front of goal - and most notably his wastefulness - which detractors will ultimately point to in defining the success of his Liverpool career.

Here are the headline numbers:

Nunez has the lowest shot conversion rate of all Liverpool's forwards over the past three seasons, with 11.1%

His expected goals (xG) underperformance is the poorest among Liverpool forwards since the start of the 2022-23 campaign, at -8.5xG

Of the 15 players to register the most shots in the Premier League since 2022-23, Nunez's conversion rate ranks second-lowest (25 goals from 226 attempts)

He is the Premier League's second-biggest xG underperformer in the past three seasons, after Dominic Calvert-Lewin (-13.7xG)

Of the 10 players to receive the most opportunities defined as 'big chances' since 2022-23, Nunez has the poorest conversion rate of those at 23.6%

But what else do the numbers tell us about Nunez - and why does he still leave Anfield as a fan favourite?

As previously alluded to, Nunez delivered memorable moments.

He produced more 90th-minute winners (three) than any other player in the Premier League since the start of the 2022-23 campaign. That includes goals in stoppage time.

In fact, only six players in Premier League history have scored more.

With fans desperate to see his Liverpool career ignite, they also often shared in his obvious exasperation as luck frequently appeared to elude him.

That was certainly evident when he hit the woodwork a Premier League record four times in a game against Chelsea during the 2023-24 season.

That misfortune contributed to him hitting the post or crossbar more times (14) than any other player since his Premier League debut.

What went wrong for Nunez?

If Darwin Nunez had a composure and calmness under stress to match his physical ability, we'd be talking about the best striker on the planet. And I mean that.

He is ferociously quick and powerful, but works hard off the ball, too. It's no wonder Jurgen Klopp was so desperate to sign him. But despite getting in great positions again and again, Nunez just couldn't finish.

His shooting when Liverpool were at 0-0 or one goal down was largely abysmal, except for the bizarre occurrences when he'd score 90th-minute winners.

Why is there a fondness from fans?

Nunez wore his heart on his sleeve and his fragility was endearing.

You could tell when it wasn't going well for him - it was written all over his face. But you could also see how desperately he wanted it. In the end, this probably held him back.

And yet, he still chased lost causes, closed things down and occasionally did brilliant things. His emotional vulnerability led fans to love him, especially those who go to Anfield - not the ones on the internet whose teasing also affected his confidence.

Is the sale the right move?

Of course.

He's effectively ended his career as a high-pedigree player by going to Saudi Arabia for the money.

If Liverpool can use the money recouped for Nunez on Alexander Isak, a massive upgrade, every supporter will be delighted. If we somehow don't buy a forward, we'll look very light up top, but I trust fully in Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes to get Isak done.

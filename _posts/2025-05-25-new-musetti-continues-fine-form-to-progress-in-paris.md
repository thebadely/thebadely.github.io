In-form eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti safely cruised into the second round of the French Open with a dominant straight-set win over German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.

The Italian grew into his 7-5 6-2 6-0 victory, taking each of the last 11 games on Court Philippe Chatrier.

World number eight Musetti was the highest-ranked men's player in action on day one of the clay Grand Slam and appeared a level above Hanfmann throughout their tie.

The 2024 Wimbledon semi-finalist needed just 29 minutes to wrap up the final set, with Hanfmann failing to hold serve after the third game of the second.

Musetti, 23, who broke into the top 10 for the first time earlier in May, is in sparkling form on clay.

In April he was beaten in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters by Carlos Alcaraz and this month reached the semi-finals of the Madrid Open and Italian Open.

"This month has been incredible. I've reached many of my goals," he said. 

"But I think the best is yet to come. I've managed to find a way to make the click I needed to step forward in the rankings and in my level."

He will face Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan in the second round at Roland Garros.

Elsewhere on Sunday, American 12th seed Tommy Paul came from a set down to beat Dane Elmer Moeller 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-3 6-1. 

Fellow American Ben Shelton, seeded 13th, needed five sets to overcome Italian Lorenzo Sonego, winning 6-4 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-3 in the night session on Court Philippe Chatrier. 

And 15th seed Frances Tiafoe, also from the US, defeated Russian Roman Safiullin 6-4 7-5 6-4.

But two seeds were knocked out of the men's singles on day one as 32nd seed Alex Michelsen was beaten 6-3 6-2 6-4 by Argentine qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo, while another Argentine, Mariano Navone, defeated 28th-seeded American Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (7-2) 4-6 6-1 6-2.

Last Pundit Standing winner crowned at Wembley

Nahyan Chowdhury fell to his knees in tears as Alex Scott called out his name at Wembley.

The 25-year-old from Liverpool had just been announced as the winner of the Last Pundit Standing - the BBC's bold new talent search to find their next football expert.

Chowdhury - who works full-time as a chemist - was one of 12 content creators selected for the show from more than 400 applicants.

Over seven episodes, the contestants were challenged by some of the biggest names in the game through a series of tasks staged at iconic football locations.

With points up for grabs in each challenge, the top four progressed to the semi-final before the finalists battled it out to be crowned the winner at Wembley on the day of the 2025 FA Cup final.

Chowdhury went head-to-head with Toby Addison and the pair were challenged to create a bespoke 60-second social media video centred around the FA Cup final.

The finalists had won two challenges each heading into the final and were closely-tied until the end.

"The chosen creator has shown great resilience being able to deliver under pressure and has an exciting future in this role," Scott said as she announced the winner.

Chowdhury was overcome with emotion as he was hugged and congratulated by Addison.

From the first challenge at Goodison Park in episode one - where Chowdhury was the only contestant to hit the woodwork in the crossbar challenge - hearing the news at Wembley was a full circle moment for him.

"Fair play," Addison said. "He comes in week one at Goodison and hits the crossbar. It was destined."

With a contract at BBC Sport secured, Chowdhury's first day in his new role will be 12 August.

"I'm excited, get me in and get straight going," he said. "I wanted to get in there straight away and make an impact and prove I am a worthy winner.

"I had no idea I'd be in this position. If you asked me a year ago and you said you would be making content and be on a TV show, I'd have said 'no chance'. I never thought about it because you just don't see people like me doing that kind of thing. I am so lucky I have been thrown into this position.

"I've done it, I've proved to myself that I can do it and I'm going to prove to everyone else that I am a worthy winner. It's not the end, it's just the beginning.

"I am the last pundit standing."

According to new developments, Lando Norris finished third at last year's race at Silverstone

Lando Norris said his first home victory at the British Grand Prix was "pure joy, pure emotion".

The McLaren driver beat team-mate Oscar Piastri, inheriting the lead after the Australian was given a 10-second penalty for his driving before a safety-car restart.

He has narrowed the gap to leader Piastri in the drivers' championship to eight points.

Norris said: "It's a very selfish moment but it is one of the most special because it's such a rare thing to feel.

"For me, the best win. Maybe not the best way to win. I'm not going to say it was my best-fought win. That's not true.

"But in terms of what it means to win at home and in front of my own grandstand, the fans, McLaren, HRH [the Duke of Kent] is here and to have a one-two and make amends for last year makes it even more special. Very memorable."

The Briton was referring to the fact that he could have won at Silverstone in 2024 but for a wrong choice of tyres by McLaren at his final pit stop.

Norris points towards his cut nose

Norris, 25, suffered an injury to his nose while he was celebrating after the race.

He was climbing on the barriers separating the pit lane from the track, with photographers next to him. One of the photographers slipped and knocked the trophy into his nose.

It is the second nose cut he has suffered in a year - he has a scar from a cut he received from a glass during a party last summer.

Before suffering the injury, Norris said: "No tears. I tried but when I get emotional I don't cry. I smile. It was just pure joy, pure emotion of the moment you're in. I wish I'd cried because it looks better.

"This is where it all started for me. I saw my grandstand today and was thinking someone's got to win today, there is no reason why it can't be me.

"I sometimes find it difficult to be positive before races but I was surprised today that I had the pace when I needed it.

"I join a long list of pretty incredible winners here, most of them are Lewis [Hamilton] but to join him and continue the reign on the British side is pretty amazing."

Norris spent most of the first half of the race in third, but moved up after second-placed Max Verstappen spun his Red Bull at a safety-car restart.

He then took the lead when Piastri served his penalty at his final pit stop in the closing laps.

Although Norris somewhat inherited the win, team principal Andrea Stella said: "Looking at Lando's enthusiasm and happiness, he definitely got the full experience.

"He knew that he drove very well today and in fairness to Lando, he lost the position because of a problem on the team. He was second at some stage and he ended up from a piece of sequence third.

"So, Lando has done his job, he has done it fair and square, no faults at all of his own.

"He drove very well, he drove fast, he found himself in the lead and he won the British Grand Prix. He should completely and fully enjoy this great experience and this immense joy."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Liverpool were crowned Premier League champions weeks ago but the predictions title race has gone to the wire.

BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton leads the way going into the final day of the season, but only by virtue of the total points he has scored compared to his guests (see tables at bottom of page). 

The BBC readers are further back but can still have a say on who will finish top - if you or Chris win this week, then he will triumph for a third-successive season.

"I really hope the readers win this week, because I am not confident of beating my guest at all," said Sutton.

"The last day of the season always sees some unexpected results, whether teams have anything to play for or not."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.

For week 38, he takes on superstar DJ and producer Paul Oakenfold, who is a Chelsea fan.

Oakenfold's new track, Novacaine, is out now. He starts his European tour in Brighton on Friday.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Oakenfold is a three-time Grammy award winner who has twice been voted the number one DJ in the world

Oakenfold has been a Chelsea fan for more than 50 years but he could easily have started supporting a different London club as a boy, until a visit to Stamford Bridge made his mind up for good.

"My whole family are Arsenal supporters but I went to Chelsea with my cousin, and that was it for me," he told BBC Sport. "I was so young, I just liked the whole King's Road and the colour blue. 

"I just wasn't feeling Arsenal despite them being a much more successful team at that time - I liked the whole idea of an underdog, and that's what we were back then."

A lot has changed at Chelsea down the decades that Oakenfeld has been following them, but he has got favourite players from every period.

"My first heroes were when I first went, the era of Peter Bonetti, Peter Osgood, Ron 'Chopper' Harris and Ian Hutchinson," he explained. "That was the era that I first got excited and was going to watch them.

"We have had plenty of big stars since then, like Ruud Gullit, Michael Ballack and Gianluca Vialli but the big moment for Chelsea and Chelsea fans was actually when Gianfranco Zola came in 1996.

"Zola would pick up the ball and run at people, he would do tricks to beat them and he got you out of your seat. That was the first time we had someone really that good, and that exciting.

"Since then we have players like Eden Hazard who can do the same but Zola was the first one where you would watch him and just be thinking 'oh my god!' Diego Maradona taught him how to take free-kicks too - there was nothing he couldn't do."

Chris Sutton and Paul Oakenfold were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Oakenfold set up the pioneering Perfecto label and, as well as providing film scores for movies like Swordfish, The Bourne Identity and Collateral, he has produced and remixed artists such as U2, Madonna, Britney Spears and The Rolling Stones

Vitality Stadium, 16:00 BST

It's a little odd that Jamie Vardy is not going to play for Leicester on Sunday after his farewell game at King Power Stadium last week.

I'd only just got him in my Fantasy team, in time for his 200th goal for the Foxes, but he is coming out again now and, without him, I don't fancy Leicester to score. 

Bournemouth were a bit flat against Manchester City on Tuesday and were well beaten in the end, but I am expecting a better showing from them here.

That defeat means the Cherries can no longer finish eighth so their hopes of European football are over but a win here would give them a chance of equalling their highest-ever finish of ninth place (in 2016-17). That's what I'm going for.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Paul's prediction: Bournemouth to win this one. 2-0

Craven Cottage, 16:00 BST

Manchester City were really good in their win over Bournemouth on Tuesday, and they did not let the disappointment of last weekend's FA Cup final defeat affect them. Omar Marmoush was excellent, they created lots of chances and defended strongly too.

City still made mistakes, though, and the stray passes that led to Mateo Kovacic being sent off and also gifted Bournemouth a late goal are the kind of simple errors you don't expect their players to make.

City will miss Kovacic here because he gives them legs in midfield and knits their play together so well, and without him I have a sneaky feeling that this will not be a straightforward afternoon for them. The way the season has gone for Pep Guardiola's side, I would not put it past them to screw this up.

They only need a point to secure a top-five finish and maintain their ever-present record in the Champions League since 2011 but, with the way Fulham play, they are in for a tough time at Craven Cottage.

I still think City will find a way of winning, but me saying that is probably bad news for Pep Guardiola's side. I've found it impossible to predict Fulham all season and, whatever I say they will do, I am usually wrong.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Paul's prediction: A draw would do for City but they are going to win this. They are going to go for it, and Fulham don't have much to play for but I still think it will be close. City will definitely grab two goals and while Fulham will score, it will only be a consolation. 1-2

Portman Road, 16:00 BST

Fair play to any fans, home or away, who are going to this game.

Ipswich have won only once at home all season, while West Ham have been woeful for weeks now and will be glad to see the back of this campaign too.

The Ipswich fans have still always backed their team despite their poor form at Portman Road so it would be nice for them to end on some kind of a high note after their relegation, but I just don't see it happening.

West Ham supporters have not had much to smile about either, but Jarrod Bowen has been one of the few bright spots for the Hammers recently. He is a quality player, and he might make the difference here too.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Paul's prediction: Neither of them have had good seasons, have they? 1-1

Anfield, 16:00 BST

This is an example of an end-of-season game which is impossible to predict. It is the champions versus the FA Cup winners but I have no idea what kind of teams both managers will put out.

Liverpool have pretty much been on the beach since they secured their title at the end of April, while Palace left out several first-team players in their win over Wolves on Tuesday, with Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta only coming on for the last 10 minutes.

Palace are on a high after their Wembley win last weekend and if Eze and Mateta start against a weakened Liverpool side then I'd fancy the Eagles' chances. They have got some good players, and the pressure is completely off them.

You have to think that Arne Slot will go with a strong side here, though, to finish a great season with a win in front of the Anfield crowd before Liverpool get their hands on the Premier League trophy at full-time.

That's what I am guessing Slot will do, but it's a big gamble by me with my predictions title on the line.

Slot might do something very different and Eze and Mateta could cause carnage if Virgil van Dijk is left on the bench again, like he was in Monday's defeat by Brighton.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Paul's prediction: It's good for the Premier League to see two teams like Newcastle and Crystal Palace win a cup this year. I am going for a draw because Palace are on a high. It is at Anfield and it is the last game of the season - usually I would go with Liverpool all day long but they have taken their foot off the pedal. 1-1

Old Trafford, 16:00 BST

This might seem like one of the most stupid things I have ever said, but this is a massive game for Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.

In the fall-out after their Europa League final defeat, there have been further question marks over his inability to change his system, and also how there is seemingly a lack of thought going into his substitutions after how late he left them against Spurs - his first changes came after 71 minutes.

Amorim said after Wednesday's defeat in Bilbao that if the club's owners want to get rid of him, he would go without getting any compensation. When he comes out with stuff like that, it almost sounds to me as if he wants the sack.

We had a lot of United fans on 606 after the game and I can understand both sides of the argument when it comes to Amorim's future.

On one hand, he hasn't adapted his tactics to English football and you could say the United team has got worse under him, which is a hard thing to do after Erik ten Hag's stint in charge.

But then you also have to consider how Amorim was kind of railroaded into taking the job in November, after being told he had to come in straightaway or he might not get the job at the end of the season. He said then that he needed to play his system, and he hasn't been able to bring his own players in to do that.

His problem now, though, is even if he does get the backing of the United hierarchy and gets given the chance to bring his own players in this summer, who is going to want to come to Old Trafford?

There is no European football as an incentive, and that is a massive problem.

So, Amorim badly needs some kind of positive result to end the season with, and he would probably bite your hand off now if you offered him a draw against Aston Villa, who really need a win to have a chance of making the top five.

With what's at stake for Villa, though, I am expecting them to take the points. Unai Emery's side will be too good for United, and Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers could really do some damage to their defence.

I feel sorry for Amorim, because he seems like a really nice guy who is very likeable, but that won't help him keep his job.

We asked one United fan who called up 606 on Wednesday night whether he would want to keep Amorim on and he said he would love to have Sunday lunch with him, but that's not the same as wanting him to stay on as manager, is it?

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Paul's prediction: I have DJed at Old Trafford and at Etihad Stadium for Soccer Aid. I sat in the directors' box at both grounds and at City they have got heated seats - you can press a button and warm them up. Man United have not got that! We could do with Villa dropping points here, but I can't see United helping us out. 1-2

St James' Park, 16:00 BST

Newcastle are at home, and their superior goal difference means they know any sort of win will keep them in the Champions League places regardless of what Aston Villa do.

I usually fancy Eddie Howe's side to win when they are at St James' Park but there are serious doubts over Alexander Isak's fitness which is a real worry. I would have a different feeling if he was in the team.

On top of that, Everton are an awkward team to break down, who also carry an attacking threat with Beto in such good form.

So, I don't think this will be straightforward at all. I am still backing the Magpies, but I would not be surprised if Everton nicked a point.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Paul's prediction: Newcastle need a win and they are going to get it. 2-1

City Ground, 16:00 BST

What a game this is, and it's a must-watch if you're a neutral too. 

Nothing against my old club Chelsea, but I'd love to go with my heart and say Nottingham Forest will beat them and finish in the top five - it's just I don't think either of those things will happen.

The City Ground will be absolutely jumping, of course, but it was the same for Forest's past three home league games, against Leicester, Brentford and Everton, and they only have one point to show for them - from their draw with the Foxes.

Chelsea are probably going to need a win too, to finish above Aston Villa and stay in the top five, but I can see this ending in the result neither team wants, which is a draw.

That was the result when they met at Stamford Bridge in October, in a game that saw a thrilling finish with chances at both ends. I am expecting more of the same here, with both sides ending up disappointed.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Paul's prediction: I think we will win but I am not sure who is going to get our goals because both our senior centre-forwards are out.

Listen, this could be a disaster season. We could draw at Forest and see Newcastle and Villa win so we don't make the Champions League, and Real Betis [who Chelsea play in next week's Europa Conference League final] are dangerous too. They are sixth in La Liga and they are on fire, especially Antony, the kid on loan from Manchester United.

On top of that, Tottenham are one place above the bottom three but they have got in the Champions League, so we really have to get in there next season too. I don't care who scores our goals, we just have to win! 1-2

Paul on his favourite Chelsea player: How can you pick one? Frank Lampard obviously comes to mind as well as Zola but then there is Didier Drogba, there is Diego Costa and Eden Hazard... I can't pick one, I don't think you can, really.

Paul on Chelsea's future prospects: I look at our team and think we are still two to three seasons away from where people eventually expect us to be because we have a lot of young players, on long-term deals. Already we seeing some of them really come good - Enzo Fernandez, Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo for example. I am still not sure about our manager, but we will see.

St Mary's Stadium, 16:00 BST

There will be Arsenal fans going to this game who are really jealous of Tottenham and what they have achieved this season, you can be sure of it.

Mikel Arteta's side have been miles better than Spurs, obviously, but they don't have a trophy to show for it, unlike their north London rivals, and trophies are what football is about.

It's absurd to suggest Arteta should be any under pressure though.

As for my prediction, well this one is pretty easy to call. Arsenal are without the injured William Saliba at the back, but they have got Declan Rice as their driving force and this should be a routine win for the Gunners.

Southampton held out for a draw against Manchester City in their previous home game but I expect they are still too worn out from celebrating that point to get anything here.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Paul's prediction: Arsenal to edge it. 0-1

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 16:00 BST

The proverb 'he who laughs last, laughs longest' certainly applies to Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, who has answered his critics by winning the Europa League and will be able to enjoy a party atmosphere on Sunday too.

I am delighted for Ange because some of the flak he has taken has been extraordinarily over the top. One newspaper suggested he would be known as a clown if Spurs had lost Wednesday's final, which is the kind of thing I haven't read since the days when England boss Graham Taylor was compared to a turnip.

The people who write that kind of thing either don't look at Postecoglou's track record or they have been dismissive of it. Fair play to him, because he came out a few months back and talked about always winning something in his second season at a club.

He said it because it was true and also because he believed he could win a trophy this season with Spurs too and, you know what, he has gone and backed it up. There were so many people out there who were desperate for him to fail, but he has rammed that down their throats.

Postecoglou is a good guy, but people were continuously trying to poke him and provoke him in interviews. He wants to stay as Spurs boss and I hope he does but, regardless of what happens in the summer, he has proved he is a winner. He is a legendary figure at Tottenham now, and I am absolutely made up for him.

His players gave everything against Manchester United and it was a defensive masterclass. I hear a lot about how Tottenham always play the same way under Postecoglou, but that wasn't 'Ange-ball' as I know it - with their lack of possession in that game (27%), it was more like 'Ange-wall'.

I am not sure how much the Spurs players will have left in their legs for this game, especially against a Brighton team who have found a bit of form, are playing with freedom and are also looking to secure eighth place and possibly a European spot too.

That's why I am going for the Seagulls to win - but I don't think the Spurs fans will care too much about this result, and understandably so.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Paul's prediction: Spurs will be on a high after winning the Europa League. 2-1

Molineux, 16:00 BST

I am not sure which Wolves we will see here - after going on a six-match winning streak, they have now lost three games in a row - or if their star forward Matheus Cunha will be recalled after starting Tuesday's defeat by Crystal Palace on the bench.

Brentford still have an outside chance of finishing eighth despite losing at home to Fulham last week - I admit I did not see that result coming, but I rarely do when Fulham are involved.

Brentford have been great on the road recently and have only lost one away game since Christmas, but I am going to go for a draw here for tactical reasons, because I think everyone else will too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Paul's prediction: A hard one to call, let's go for a draw. 1-1

Sutton needed a win to keep his predictions title hopes alive going into the final week of the season, and he got one in style.

He got seven correct results, including four exact scores, from the 10 Premier League games in week 37, giving him a total of 190 points.

That was enough to beat his guest, DJ and producer Barry Can't Swim, who got five correct results with no exact scores, for a tally of 50 points.

Sutton also outdid the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game - who got six correct results, with two exact scores, for a total of 120 points.

The victory puts Chris back on top of the predictions table - level with the guests on outright weekly wins but above them thanks to his superior points tally - but will he stay there?

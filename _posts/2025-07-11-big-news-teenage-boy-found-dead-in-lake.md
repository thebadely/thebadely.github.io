It has been recently reported that The body of a teenage boy has been recovered from a lake in Birmingham.

West Midlands Police said the discovery was made after the boy was reported to have gone missing in the water at Sutton Park just after 18:00 BST on Thursday.

The force said "extensive efforts" had been made by the emergency services and Birmingham City Council to find him.

His death was not being treated as suspicious, it said, and his family was being supported.

The police force said it was liaising with the coroner and "supporting the family of the boy at this tragic time".

Sutton Park is a 2,400 acre National Nature Reserve and one of the largest urban parks in Europe, according to Birmingham City Council.

It includes woodland, heathland, marshes and seven lakes, including Powell's Pool, where the teenager's body was discovered.

At a size of 48 acres it is the largest lake in the park.

In 2001 another teenage boy, Fraser Amiss, died after diving into Powell's Pool with two friends.

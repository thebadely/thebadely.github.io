Lionesses support Carter following racial abuse - Bronze

England are working with police after defender Jess Carter revealed she had been the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025.

And in a statement on Sunday, the Lionesses said they would stop the anti-racism gesture of taking a knee before matches as it was "clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism".

Carter added she would take a step back from social media.

The Football Association said it was "working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice".

"From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse," said Carter, 27.

"While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result, I don't agree, or think, it's OK to target someone's appearance or race.

"As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with."

More abuse as women's football grows - Bronze

Carter's England team-mate Lotte Wubben-Moy said she would be also be coming off social media.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: "There is no place for racism in football or anywhere in society.

"I stand with Jess, the Lionesses, and any players who have suffered racism, on and off the pitch."

Carter, who made her England debut in 2017 and has 49 caps, was a member of the squad that won Euro 2022.

Having started her career at Birmingham City, she won five Women's Super League titles with Chelsea before leaving for American club Gotham FC last summer.

The United States National Women's Soccer League side said they were "heartbroken and outraged".

"Jess is not only a world-class football player, she is a role model, a leader and a valued part of our Gotham FC family," the club said.

"We stand with Jess, and we deeply appreciate the support for Jess from the Lionesses and England's Football Association." 

Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out sent its support to Carter, and backed her decision to step away from social media.

Kick It Out said those responsible "should face the strongest possible consequences", adding "responsibility also lies with social media companies".

It said: "We have been working with the government and the regulator, but we know that more urgency is needed from everyone involved."

Uefa, European football's governing body Uefa, said: "Abuse and discrimination should never be tolerated, whether in football or society, in person or online."

The Lionesses' next match is against Italy in the Euro 2025 semi-finals on Tuesday.

Jess Carter has made 49 England appearances since her debut in 2017

It has not been a smooth tournament for Carter, who has started every game in defence for England, switching positions from left-back to centre-back after a difficult experience in the opening-game defeat by France.

England's defensive unit has been scrutinised for several months because of their inconsistency, and Carter also endured a tough time against Sweden in their quarter-final, which the Lionesses won in a penalty shootout after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2.

She was sent racial abuse on social media following that game, but it is not something new to women's football.

During the 2023 Women's World Cup, forward Lauren James suffered similar abuse when she was sent off for standing on the back of Nigerian forward Michelle Alozie in their last-16 victory.

James' club Chelsea posted a statement condemning it when the 23-year-old was again a target of racial abuse following a WSL defeat by Arsenal in December 2023.

The Lionesses have often aligned with each other in the face of such abuse, and it was a player-led decision for Carter, the Football Association and some of her team-mates to raise the matter again on Sunday.

Carter's position in the team for Tuesday's semi-final against Italy was not assured, with Esme Morgan pushing for a start after a good performance in the win over Sweden.

Manager Sarina Wiegman will have a decision to make on whether to protect Carter from further abuse, which has grown across the tournament.

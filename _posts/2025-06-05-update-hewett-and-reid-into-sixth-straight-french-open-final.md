British pair Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett reached the final of the French Open men's wheelchair doubles for the sixth straight year.

The top seeds beat Casey Ratzlaff of the USA and Japan's Takuya Miki 6-2 6-3 amid increasingly heavy rain at Roland Garros.

An ace from Reid sealed victory in Paris on the pair's second match point.

They will play either Tokito Oda of Japan and France's Stephane Houdet or the duo of Spaniard Daniel Caverzaschi and Argentine Gustavo Fernandez in the final.

Scotland's Reid and Engand's Hewett have won the past five titles at Roland Garros.

They claimed victory in an hour and 14 minutes amid a sea of umbrellas on court 12, with all the other outdoor courts being covered to protect against the rain.

Following a first set which saw six breaks of serve - four of them by the British team - the second was much more straightforward for the perennial champions, in spite of the conditions.

It capped a slightly odd day for Reid and Hewett, which they started as opponents in the singles quarter-finals.

Hewett, the second seed, triumphed 6-2 6-4. He will play fourth seed Fernandez in the singles semi-finals.

Elsewhere, Britain's Andy Lapthorne suffered double elimination in men's quad wheelchair events on Thursday.

The Englishman's day started with a 6-4 6-4 defeat in the singles semi-final to top seed Niels Vink of the Netherlands.

He then suffered another last-four loss in the doubles as, along with Dutch partner Sam Schroder, he was beaten in the match tie-break by Ahmet Kaplan of Turkey and South Africa's Donald Ramphadi, losing 6-3 2-6 10-7.

Lapthorne and Schroder, the second seeds, fought back from losing the first set by winning the second in 35 minutes, and were ahead in the first-to-10 shootout decider before suffering defeat against their unseeded opponents.

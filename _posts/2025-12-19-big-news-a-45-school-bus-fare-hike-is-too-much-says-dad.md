Experts revealed that A dad-of-two wants a bus operator to reconsider its charges for a popular school route amid plans for a huge fare hike.

Ambi Ambituuni's daughter currently uses the 85 bus operated by National Express to travel between her home in Coventry and her school in Rugby - journeys costing £165 a term.

From January 1, the same route will be taken over by Stagecoach and the fares are set to be £75.60 a month, which equates to a 45% increase over a term.

Stagecoach has been contacted for comment.

Mr Ambituuni said he learnt of the change of bus operator through a parents' group chat which prompted him to check what the new fares would be, learning the term-long outlay would equate to £302.40.

"It is a substantial amount, especially given the cost of living pressure right now on parents and on guardians and I know it will be an issue many will be facing come January 2026," he said.

The bus Mr Ambituuni's daughter uses is popular as it serves three schools in Rugby.

He wants Warwickshire County Council and Stagecoach to consider the impact the fare increase will have.

"I think they need to look at the pricing again," he said. "It should be like for like with what National Express is offering.

"I think that they should offer prices that are comparable. I think that Warwickshire County Council needs to put pressure on the operator given that they are the ones that offered the contract to the operator."

The local authority has been contacted for comment.

Let's dive into the details: Katie Uhlaender had been aiming to reach her sixth Olympics

Canada's skeleton chiefs have been cleared of manipulating qualification for next month's Winter Olympics but "reminded" they should "act within the spirit" of the sport's code of ethics.

An investigation was launched by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) after Canada withdrew four athletes from the North American Cup at Lake Placid on Sunday.

USA slider Katie Uhlaender claimed it cost her a spot at the Milano-Cortina Games as it cut the field to fewer than 21, reducing the number of ranking points available.

IBSF said rules allowed national federations "to withdraw athletes from competition at any time" but that it would carry out a review in the spring to "possibly suggest adjustments".

In a statement, the organisation explained its Interim Integrity Unit "dismissed the complaints as the current IBSF rules and regulations did not give grounds for a breach of the international rules, the code of conduct, and respectively the code of ethics".

However, it "noted that the Canadian coach and the national federation shall be reminded that, whilst acting within the letter of the IBSF code of conduct, it is expected that all parties concerned should also act within the spirit of the code, whose aim is to promote fair play and ethical conduct at all times".

In quotes reported by DW,, external double world champion Uhlaender alleged she was told of the plan by Canada coach Joe Cecchini and described it as having "nailed my coffin" as she attempted to qualify for a sixth Olympics.

Rival federations alleged the move was aimed at protecting Canada's Games quota.

Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton had earlier defended the decision, saying it had been made following "careful consideration of athlete health, safety, and long-term development".

According to new developments, Oleksandr Usyk is an Olympic gold medalist, three-time undisputed world champion and unbeaten in 24 pro fights 

Oleksandr Usyk says he will continue to fight for two more years and plans to return to the ring in 2026, but has ruled out a bout with British heavyweight Moses Itauma.

Usyk, 38, stopped Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in July to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion.

The Ukrainian, who also previously held all four recognised world titles at cruiserweight, had previously hinted that he would fight only once more before retiring.

However, the pound-for-pound star appears to have reversed that decision.

"I'll fight until I'm 41," Usyk told the Ready to Fight website. "Then I'll build a sports academy - I'll train there and train others."

Usyk said he is back in training after being sidelined by a back injury which forced the postponement of a fight with WBO mandatory challenger Joseph Parker.

He added that, "God willing", he will return next year but dismissed 20-year-old Chatham fighter Itauma as a potential opponent.

"No, I won't fight Itauma," Usyk said. "He's young - always teasing me. And he said himself he doesn't hit grandpas. 

"I can't say who exactly [I'll fight next] because negotiations are ongoing. I'd be lying if I gave you a name."

Itauma extended his unbeaten record to 13 wins, with 11 knockouts, by stopping former world title challenger Dillian Whyte inside two minutes in August.

The WBA has ordered its secondary champion, Kubrat Pulev, to face Itauma next, although the Bulgarian is keen to defend his belt against Murat Gassiev in Dubai in December.

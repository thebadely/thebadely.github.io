Here’s what you need to know: Gede Priandana opened the batting for Indonesia, making six in a total of 167-5

Indonesia's Gede Priandana became the first bowler to take five wickets in an over in a T20 international.

The 28-year-old seamer claimed a hat-trick in returning figures of 5-1 from his only over as Indonesia beat Cambodia by 60 runs in the opening game, external of the eight-match series in Bali.

Brought into the attack in the 16th over with Cambodia 106-5 in pursuit of 168, Priandana removed Shah Abrar Hussain, Nirmaljit Singh and Chanthoeun Rathanak with his first three balls.

He bowled a dot ball before dismissing Mongdara Sok and Pel Vannak either side of a wide as Cambodia were bowled out for 107.

Priandana has taken 24 wickets at an average of 17 and scored 1,040 runs at 19.62 in 63 T20s for Indonesia.

Cricket Indonesia chairman Abhiram Singh Yadav told BBC Sport: "Today Indonesia showed two things at once: the ability to execute games and win, and the ability to produce world-class moments.

"Five wickets in one over is a symbol of discipline, courage and the training standards we continue to build.

"This is not the finish line. This is a sign that Indonesian cricket is levelling up."

Bangladeshi Al-Amin Hossain and Indian Abhimanyu Mithun have taken five wickets in an over in domestic T20 cricket.

When Indonesia and Cambodia met in a T20 in November 2023, Cambodia conceded the match midway through their innings and accused the home umpires of "making huge mistakes".

Indonesia are 64th and Cambodia 46th in the International Cricket Council T20 rankings.

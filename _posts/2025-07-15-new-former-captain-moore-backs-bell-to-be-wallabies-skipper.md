Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Bell has been capped 37 times since making his debut for Australia in 2020

Former Australia captain Stephen Moore would select prop Angus Bell to skipper the Wallabies against the British and Irish Lions.

Australia head coach Joe Schmidt is yet to name his series captain, with the first Test kicking off on Saturday in Brisbane (11:00 BST).

Number eight Harry Wilson, who scored a late try to defeat Fiji in the Wallabies' only warm-up game, is the favourite to skipper the side after performing the role in that win and against England, Scotland and Ireland in November.

"We need our players that are world class, Angus Bell is a good example. I would have had him as captain if it was up to me," Moore told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.

"Captaincy is an area they have ummed and ahhed about over the last couple of years.

"I don't know if it will be Harry Wilson, I think so, as he was captain against Fiji and they haven't named the captain."

Squad members James Slipper, Will Skelton and David Porecki, who only this year has got over his injury troubles that kept him out since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, have all captained Australia in the past two years.

Schmidt said Wilson is "one of the players at the forefront" of his thinking when it comes to a Test captain, but added he wanted to ensure his skipper was fully fit.

Flanker Rob Valetini missed the game against Fiji through injury and Moore believes his selection in the back row might be a problem for Wilson.

"Joe would have preferred to do that right [naming the captain], but that it is not his story to keep chopping and changing. He is finding out the best way to win," added Moore, who played in all three Tests against the Lions in 2013.

"Is Harry in that team? If Rob Valetini plays then are they in that team together? Do they need a jumping back rower?

"There are bunch of options that they have got and they are just not clear on the right one is. That is why we are seeing that hesitation."

Following the win over Fiji, the Wallabies' first-choice fly-half Noah Lolesio was ruled out of the series through injury.

That injury means 22-year-old Tom Lynagh, son of 1991 World Cup-winning number 10 Michael, is reportedly set, external to start his first Test on Saturday.

Veteran back James O'Connor, 35, and 17-cap Ben Donaldson are Schmidt's other options in the position.

O'Connor started all three Tests against the Lions in 2013 but has not played international rugby in almost three years.

Moore believes number 10 remains a "gap" in the national team.

"Since Stephen Larkham retired in 2007, we haven't had an out-and-out world-class 10 for a period of time like the other great nations have had," the former hooker added.

"It is a big position and we are going into a series with some younger players being tried and tested on a very big stage.

"Joe will make sure that their job is kept as simple as possible so they know exactly what they need to do under pressure and they can go out and execute it."

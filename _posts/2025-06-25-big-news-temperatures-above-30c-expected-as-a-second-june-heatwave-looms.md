According to new developments, The second heatwave of 2025 is set to send temperatures soaring back over the 30C mark this weekend. 

The hot weather will last into the first part of next week with the heat becoming increasingly intense with the possibility of recording the highest temperature of the year so far.

The hottest day of 2025 to date was recorded on 21 June at Charlwood, Surrey with temperatures reaching 33.2C (91.8F). 

Heatwaves are becoming more common due to climate change, with a greater chance of seeing extreme heat. 

There are lots of summer events that will be affected by the heat. It's likely to be the hottest start to Wimbledon, surpassing the record of 29.3C (measured at Kew) from 2001. Temperatures will get close to the Glastonbury record of 31.2C (measured at Rodney Stoke) recorded in 2017.

The highest temperature of 2025 is likely to be reached on Monday

Rain and showers are forecast for Thursday with a fresh feel to the weather. 

Humidity increases on Friday as a warm airmass associated with the recent extreme heatwave in the USA makes its way across the Atlantic. Rain and showers will affect the north-west of the UK, but with more sunshine in eastern England, temperatures will head into the high 20C's.

It becomes much hotter over the weekend as a ridge of high pressure over Europe influences our weather. On Saturday temperatures will more widely cross 'heatwave thresholds' reaching 27-30C in south-east England, East Anglia, the Midlands and Central Southern England. 

By Sunday the heat reaches parts of east Wales and north England. The highest temperatures will be in East Anglia and southeast England reaching 32C in the hotspots.

The heat will get even more intense on Monday, which is likely to be the peak of the heatwave. In East Anglia and south-east England temperatures are likely to reach 33-34C, challenging or surpassing the highest temperature of 2025. 

This is extreme heat and isn't far away from the June record which stands at 35.6C (96F), recorded at Southampton during the infamous summer of 1976.

Heatwave threshold are 25-28C across the UK

There's more uncertainty in the forecast for Tuesday onwards. Many computer models suggest cooler and fresher air arrives from the west, but it's not inconceivable that the hot weather clings on for another day or so in the east.

No heatwave is expected in Scotland and Northern Ireland with temperatures more generally staying into the low 20Cs. There will be some warm spells of sunshine around, but also the prospect of some areas of rain - for example rain could be heavy on Monday.

Heatwaves can cause problems for our infrastructure, such as trains running at reduced speeds due to the risk of train tracks expanding and buckling in the heat.  

We also see more heat-related health problems which can lead to an increase in excess deaths in those with underlying health conditions. 

Heat-health alerts are issued to warn health providers of the risk of a heat causing adverse impacts to the health and wellbeing of the population.

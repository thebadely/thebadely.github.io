Let's dive into the details: Huw Jones has just returned to the Glasgow Warriors side after injury

Scotland centre Huw Jones is to leave Glasgow Warriors to join French Top 14 club Toulon at the end of the current season.

The 32-year-old British and Irish Lion, who returned for a second spell with Glasgow from Harlequins in 2022, has signed a two-year contract.

Jones will join Scotland team-mate Ben White at Toulon, the scrum-half having signed a new two-year contract with the French club in November.

Toulon sporting director Laurent Emmanuelli told his club website: "The arrival of Huw Jones is the result of several months of groundwork.

 "He is an international-class player, a key member of his national team who has long played at the highest European and world levels. 

"His rugby skills, his high standards and his experience will be invaluable assets to the team. 

"He fits perfectly into our sporting project, which combines immediate performance with the development of our young players."

Leith-born Jones, who has 58 Scotland caps, began his career with the University of Cape Town and moved on to Western Province and Stormers before his first stint with Glasgow from 2017.

Now he moves from the side currently sitting second behind Stormers in the United Rugby Championship to one lying second in the Top 14, only behind Toulouse on points difference.

Jones, who has made 82 appearances during his two spells with Warriors, returned from injury in try-scoring fashion in Saturday's 33-21 away victory over Clermont-Auvergne in the Champions Cup.

His highs for Glasgow include crossing for the third - and ultimately match-winning - try in the URC Grand Final victory over the Vodacom Bulls in June 2024, one of 28 tries in their colours to date.

Selected for the 2025 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, he featured in all three Tests and scored a try in the decisive second-Test victory.

Toulon noted that his performances earned him a place in the World Rugby Dream Team of the Year 2025.

They go on to describe him as "a complete player" who will bring "his top-level experience, his power, his ability to break the line, his speed, as well as his game sense and defensive awareness".

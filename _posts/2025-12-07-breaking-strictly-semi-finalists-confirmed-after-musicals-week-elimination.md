Let's dive into the details: Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from Sunday's elimination

Only four couples remain in BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing 2025 after another celebrity and their professional partner were eliminated from the competition. 

Former Emmerdale star Lewis Cope and his partner Katya Jones were in the bottom two pairs following their performance for musical week, alongside reality TV star Amber Davies and her dance partner Nikita Kuzmin.

The judges decided to send Cope, who performed a salsa to Dance At The Gym from West Side Story, home. 

Davies, who danced a Charleston to Sit Down You're Rockin' The Boat from Guys And Dolls, joins Balvinder Sopal, George Clarke and Karen Carney in the semi-finals. 

"It's been more than I could have ever wished for," Cope said of the competition following his elimination on Sunday.

"If someone would have said that I'd have done 11 weeks on the show at the beginning, I'd have been over the moon."

He also paid tribute to his dance partner, of whom he said: "You've literally given me absolutely everything I could wish for as a friend, as a teacher."

Jones, in return, described Cope as a "gentleman", as well as "so humble and so kind".

"I'm so glad that we had a chance to see you and showcase your talent, and what a beautiful person you are to the world," she added. 

Davies and Kuzmin topped Saturday's leaderboard for their performance, receiving a perfect score.

EastEnders actress Balvinder Sopal and her dance partner, Julian Caillon, came second with their Viennese Waltz to Never Enough from The Greatest Showman.

Internet star George Clarke performed an Argentine tango to The Point Of No Return from The Phantom Of The Opera with his partner Alexis Warr.

And former Lioness and sports broadcaster Karen Carney and Carlos Gu took on the samba, dancing to The Rhythm Of Life from Sweet Charity.

The remaining four couples will perform during next weekend's semi-final, airing on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 18:35 GMT on Saturday 13 December, with the results show at 19:45 GMT next Sunday.

Each couple will perform two new routines and there will be performances from Australian singer Kylie Minogue and boyband Five.

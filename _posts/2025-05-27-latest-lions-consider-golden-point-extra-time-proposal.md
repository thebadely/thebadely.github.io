Let's dive into the details: Former New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen said he felt "hollow" after the series draw against the British and Irish Lions in 2017

The British and Irish Lions board is considering a proposal for sudden-death extra time if a deciding third Test this summer against Australia finishes in a draw.

Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh revealed he suggested at meetings in London that 'golden point' extra time - which means the first team to score wins - should be played in such circumstances.

In 2017, the Lions and New Zealand shared the series after the deciding third Test finished 15-15, with captain Sam Warburton saying it was "a bit of an anticlimax for the players".

Former New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen said the draw was "a bit like kissing your sister and no-one wants that".

"We've had some really constructive conversations. That's got to go to the Lions board around whether it's a drawn series, or you decide it through golden point or extra time," Waugh told the Sydney Morning Herald., external

"Our preference, if we put the fans at the centre of everything we're doing, I think that the familiarity that everyone has with 'golden point' and the interest for that in our market is a good guide.

"Obviously, we will be making sure both parties agree. But I think that if you're thinking about some fan engagement, that's certainly very appealing."

For regular season games this year, Super Rugby Pacific brought in 'golden point',, external where if the teams are level at full-time then 10 minutes of extra time is played, with a draw then declared if there is no winning score.

In April, Australian side Western Force and New Zealand's Hurricanes played out a thrilling 17-17 draw, with no score in extra time.

For Super Rugby Pacific knockout games, two 10-minute periods of standard extra time are played.

If the teams are still level, up to 10 minutes of golden point extra time are played, followed by a kicking competition if necessary.

British and Irish Lions fixtures for tour of Australia

12 from Leinster, two from Wales - the Lions squad in numbers

Sonny Bill Williams was red-carded for a first-half shoulder charge on Anthony Watson during the Lions' second Test win over New Zealand in 2017

Waugh confirmed both sides had agreed that the 20-minute red card will be used during the series.

The rule means the offending team can replace the red-carded player 20 minutes after being reduced to 14 players.

This year's Six Nations used 20-minute red cards for the first time after a trial at the Autumn Nations Cup in November.

Ireland centre Garry Ringrose, who will tour Australia this summer with the Lions, was given a first-half 20-minute red card against Wales.

Once the 20 minutes passed, Bundee Aki replaced Ringrose and played a key role in seeing the game home for Ireland.

"We've been very vocal in our support for the 20-minute red card," Waugh added.

The Lions will play a warm-up match against Argentina in Dublin on 20 June before leaving for Australia, with the three-match Test series against the Wallabies starting in Brisbane on 19 July.

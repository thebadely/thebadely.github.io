Experts revealed that Donald Trump's threat to Iran is covered by almost all of the front pages. "Countdown to conflagration" is the Daily Mail's headline. The Guardian says the threat of a US-Iranian war "appeared to loom closer" following the president's warning. According to the Daily Mirror, he is said to be "considering targets including weapons caches and members of the Revolutionary Guard". The i Paper says it has learned that "Iranians are fleeing" the capital. The front of the Financial Times has a picture of an "anti-American" poster in Tehran. It appears to show explosions on the deck of an aircraft carrier, with the slogan "if you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind".

Many papers cover Sir Keir Starmer's trip to China. The Sun focuses on a deal designed to cut the flow from China of boat parts and engines used by migrants for channel crossings - with Sir Keir saying it will "cut off the supply at source". The Express is scathing in its analysis of the prime minister's meeting with President Xi Jinping. It describes Sir Keir coming face to face with "one of the world's most powerful leaders" as the "greatest mismatch of our time". But the Mirror's editorial says the prime minister is "right to engage" with China, in "grown-up diplomacy" which involves "doing business without selling our soul".

The Times says Sir Keir has "vetoed" plans for a new attempt to change the benefits system, as Number 10 seeks "to avoid another confrontation with Labour MPs". The paper says the Department for Work and Pensions has been unsuccessful in including its bills in the King's Speech, which sets out the government's legislative agenda. But officials say "final decisions" on its contents "have not been made".

The investment minister, Lord Stockwood, has told the Financial Times that there are discussions within government about introducing a universal basic income for workers in sectors that are likely to be wiped out by artificial intelligence. He tells the paper there's a need to "think really carefully" about how to "soft-land those industries that go away".

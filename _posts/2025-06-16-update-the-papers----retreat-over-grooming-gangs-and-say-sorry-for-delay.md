It has been recently reported that US President Donald Trump's comments on the conflict between Israel and Iran make a number of the front pages. 

The Times highlights his remarks that the US could become involved and that Tehran would feel "the full strength and might" of the American military. 

The Guardian features Trump's claims that he is working behind the scenes on a deal to end the attacks. 

"We will have peace soon," he posted on social media. 

According to the Daily Telegraph, Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader. 

One senior US administration official is quoted as saying "we're not even talking about going after the political leadership".

The Sun has a photograph showing a traffic jam in Tehran. The paper says thousands tried to flee the Iranian capital. 

According to the Guardian, the city's streets are in chaos as residents rushed to buy food amid Israeli bombings.

The Daily Mail accuses the prime minister of being in "full retreat" over grooming gangs. 

The paper says having finally admitted a national inquiry was needed, the Home Office has now announced an investigation by the National Crime Agency. 

The main story in the Daily Express is a call from the leader of the Conservatives, Kemi Badenoch, that Sir Keir Starmer should apologise for repeatedly snubbing demands for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.

"Bullying probe at BBC Breakfast" is the headline accompanying the Sun's lead. 

Formal complaints have reportedly been lodged. 

The paper says the show is in crisis. 

The BBC said it would not comment on HR issues.

The Daily Telegraph features a picture of German tennis player Tatjana Maria on its front page after she became first woman to win a title at Queen's Club since 1973. 

The paper calls the triumph "the mother of all victories" for the 37-year-old, who was watched from the side-lines by her daughters who are four and 11. 

The i Paper's coverage says Maria "rolled back the years" and according to the Times she wants to prolong her career to the age of 40 so she can play doubles with her older daughter.

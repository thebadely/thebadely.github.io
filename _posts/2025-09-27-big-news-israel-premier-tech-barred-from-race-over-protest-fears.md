According to new developments, The Israel-Premier Tech team were targeted by protesters at the Vuelta a Espana

The Israel-Premier Tech cycling team have been excluded from next month's Giro dell'Emilia in Bologna over public safety concerns.

The decision follows disruption at the Vuelta a Espana this month, where the team were targeted by pro-Palestinian protests opposing Israel's war in Gaza.

The event in Spain was affected by several incidents, with the final stage being abandoned after protesters entered part of the course.

There are fears the race in Italy on 4 October could be affected by similar disruptions after pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with police in Milan on Monday during a nationwide strike called by trade unions against Israel's conduct in Gaza.

"Israel-Premier Tech has been informed that our invitation to the Giro dell'Emilia has been withdrawn," said the cycling team.

"The organisers have cited security concerns linked to planned protests that threatened to disrupt the race. We find it extremely regrettable that threats of violence have disrupted our sport."

Race organiser Adriano Amici added that the decision to exclude Israel-Premier Tech has been made "for the safety of all athletes, technical staff and spectators".

The Giro dell'Emilia is the traditional autumn race in Bologna finishing near the city's historic centre, which has a large student population and a long history of left-wing politics. 

In recent days, various groups in Bologna have announced potential protests and attempts to halt the race.

On Friday, world cycling governing body the UCI said it will continue to welcome Israeli athletes at its competitions despite calls for sporting boycotts.

This week the Israel-Premier Tech squad's title sponsor urged the team to drop the word 'Israel' from their name.

The team, whose five British riders include four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome, is Israeli registered and owned by Israeli-Canadian property billionaire Sylvan Adams.

After the United Nations commission of inquiry formally declared Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza - a claim Israel denies - there have been growing calls for the country to be suspended from international football competition.

The BBC has been told by a senior figure at one football federation that many nations are pushing for a vote on whether to throw Israel out of European football, and that the leadership of governing body Uefa wants to act.

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 65,549 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

According to new developments, US President Donald Trump's new tariffs on imports from more than 90 countries have come into effect.

The tariffs mean companies that bring foreign goods into the US will have to pay the taxes to the government, and experts say these companies may pass costs on to consumers.

Brazil faces one of the highest US tariff rates in the world, with a 50% rate applied to most goods.

India is also set to be hit with a 50% rate, effective from 27 August.

Negotiations are still under way, with both Washington and Beijing agreeing to delay any new tariffs until 12 August.

And Mexico also got a reprieve as Trump said it would be charged at current rates for another 90 days, avoiding a threatened increase to 35%.Canada already faces a 35% tariff, in effect since last Friday, although most goods are exempt under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

Here is a look at the full list of tariffs by country. Those with the highest share of US imports are at the top.

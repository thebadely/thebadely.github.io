Here’s what you need to know: Interim manager Martin O'Neill described it as "as sad a morning" as he had seen after Celtic's annual meeting was abandoned when shareholders jeered director Ross Desmond for accusing some fans of being "bullies".

The meeting at Celtic Park had earlier been adjourned for half-an-hour by chairman Peter Lawwell less than five minutes after it started following chants of "sack the board" by some shareholders.

But it was ultimately called to a halt after an hour "because of disruption" as Desmond read out a statement on behalf of himself and his father, Dermot, the club's major shareholder, who did not attend.

In a statement on their website shortly afterwards, the Scottish Premiership club said: "Such conduct is completely unacceptable and hugely disappointing.

"Clearly we regret the impact on our shareholders who were deprived of the opportunity to take part in an orderly and constructive meeting."

Celtic's board has been criticised by supporters groups over the Scottish champions' summer transfer business and failure to qualify for the Champions League, while they currently trail surprise domestic league leaders Heart of Midlothian by seven points.

Friday's meeting was also held amid the backdrop of a continued search for a new permanent team manager after Brendan Rodgers resigning last month and former boss O'Neill was appointed caretaker.

Desmond began his statement by defending his father, a "lifelong and passionate" Celtic supporter, and vowed that the board would not be "bullied by aggressive and irrational" criticism.

The Irishman defended Lawwell and chief executive Michael Nicholson and claimed attempts to "dehumanise and vilify them are shameful".

Desmond went on to criticise a section of fans over a recent incident that led to the Green Brigade ultras group being banned and added: "Those people are bullies."

That was as far as he got in his statement as the reaction of the shareholders prompted Lawwell to bring the meeting to a close.

Directors had been met with boos and dozens of red cards from shareholders as they entered the packed Kerrydale Suite, with other fans watching via video link from another function suite.

Cries of "out, out, out" followed before there were cheers for O'Neill when the interim manager was introduced.

As a season review video began to play on big screens, Celtic Trust vice-chair Jeanette Findlay approached the top table to ask that the meeting move immediately to questions.

Amid more shouts and chants of "sack the board" from shareholders, Lawwell said: "This disruptive behaviour is not on. It's got to stop. We have to have respect for everyone else in the room."

After shouts of "you respect us", Lawwell called a 30-minute adjournment.

When the meeting resumed, dozens of fans walked out as a series of videos were played on big screens while Lawwell, Nicholson and chief finance officer Chris McKay defended the board's record.

They returned after the videos in anticipation of the usual question-and-answer session, but Desmond's statement proved to the the final act.

In his video, McKay defended the club's summer cash reserve position of Â£77m, saying it "was a consequence of a very successful year in terms of Champions League performance and player trading".

However, Celtic had since "invested in major infrastructure projects, we've been through a transfer window and we've dropped to the Europa League this year".

McKay pointed out they had broken their transfer record twice in the 2024 summer window with the purchase of striker Adam Idah and midfielder Arne Engels, while missing out on the Champions League had cost Celtic about Â£25m.

"We had the highest first-team cost in the history of the club," he said. "We had the highest squad-carrying value in the history of the club. That's not lack of ambition."

Lawwell said he understood fan "frustration" and "we recognise we've made mistakes" but claimed the board's record was "not too bad" considering Celtic's record trophy haul and appearance in European group stages in all but two years.

O'Neill later said "it's as sad a morning as I've seen" and wished he "had said a few words" at the meeting to call for unity.

The 73-year-old who led Celtic to seven pieces of silverware during his first spell as manager recalled legendary predecessor Jock Stein saying "a club not united would never be successful".

At his post-match media conference, he admitted: "That was rather raucous. There were people who would have wanted to ask questions and the board have said that they've made mistakes.

"There's only so many times that you can apologise and then you have to get on with things again. So we'll start again and hopefully that will start when the new manager comes in.

"There's got to be a coming together again from this. There's an obvious disconnect at this minute, but that surely can be rectified."

O'Neill is surprised to still be in interim charge but added "that there is definitely progress being made" towards making a permanent appointment.

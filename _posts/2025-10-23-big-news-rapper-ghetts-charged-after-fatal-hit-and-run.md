Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The rapper Ghetts has been charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving after a fatal crash in north-east London.

The musician, whose real name is Justin Clarke-Samuel, allegedly failed to stop after hitting a 20-year-old man in Redbridge Lane East, Ilford, on Saturday, 18 October, the Met Police said.

Mr Clarke-Samuel, 41, appeared at Stratford Magistrates' Court on Monday, the same day the man died in hospital. The indictment is expected to change from causing serious injury to causing death by dangerous driving at the next hearing.

The rapper, from Woodford Green, was remanded into custody and is due to appear at Barkingside Magistrates' Court on Monday, 27 October. 

Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash to come forward.

Ghetts is a Mercury Prize-nominated grime MC, rapper and songwriter who has had high-profile musical collaborations with major acts including Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Skepta.

Ghetts won the Best Male Act at the Mobo Awards in 2021 and received the Mobo Pioneer Award in 2024 for his significant contribution to British black culture.

He also had a supporting role in the Netflix show Supacell.

According to new developments, Lord Mandelson called the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein his "best pal", according to a letter in an alleged "birthday book" that has been released by US lawmakers.

In the message for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, Lord Mandelson - UK ambassador to the US since last year - describes him as an "intelligent, sharp-witted man", who "parachuted" into his life.

The existence of the letter from Lord Mandelson was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in July, when the newspaper published details of the alleged birthday note.

An official spokesperson for Lord Mandelson told the BBC: "Lord Mandelson has long been clear that he very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein."

Democrats in Congress released copies of the so-called "birthday book" after the documents were subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee last month.

The documents also include a note featuring a drawing of a woman's body allegedly signed by US President Donald Trump. The White House on Monday denied its authenticity and said the president "did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it".

The "birthday book" was put together by Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring to traffic girls for sex. It is dated three years before allegations of sex abuse by Epstein became public in 2006.

When approached by the BBC, Lord Mandelson's spokesperson said that his connection to Epstein "has been a matter of public record for some time".

The spokesperson also referred to previous comments Mandelson made to the Financial Times, in which he said: "I regret ever meeting him or being introduced to him by his partner Ghislaine Maxwell."

The BBC has also approached the Foreign Office for comment.

A 2019 internal report by JP Morgan bank, filed to a New York court in 2023, said that Epstein kept a "particularly close relationship with Prince Andrew, the Duke of York and Lord Peter Mandelson, a senior member of the British government".

In the "birthday book" letter, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson writes that after Epstein appeared in his life, he "would spend many hours just waiting for him to turn up".

"And often, no sooner were you getting used to having him around, you would suddenly be alone... again, leaving you with some 'interesting' friends to entertain instead."

The letter then includes a photo of Lord Mandelson with two women, whose faces are obscured.

Lord Mandelson continues: "But wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!"

Following a photo of Mandelson sat with Epstein, he concludes: "Happy Birthday, Jeffrey. We love you!"

Along with the book, lawmakers also released a trove of documents that include Epstein's personal address book and his will.

After the Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the "birthday book", Trump filed a lawsuit against the newspaper's reporters, publisher and executives, including News Corp's owner Rupert Murdoch, seeking $10bn (Â£7.4bn) in damages.

Epstein was first criminally indicted in 2006 in Florida on a state felony charge of solicitation of prostitution. He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial.

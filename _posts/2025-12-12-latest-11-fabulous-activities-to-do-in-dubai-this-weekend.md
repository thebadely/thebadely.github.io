Here’s what you need to know: Breakfast just got a sky-high upgrade at TATTU Dubai Sky Pool, where mornings unfold 76 floors above the city with panoramic skyline views and a refined start to the day. Served daily from 7:30am to 10:30am, the Skyline Breakfast delivers elevated morning dining infused with TATTU’s signature atmosphere, think thoughtful service, beautifully executed dishes and a serene setting designed for slow, luxurious starts. Priced at Dhs149 per person, it’s an effortlessly chic way to begin the day, with bookings reserved for the restaurant experience only (pool and daybed access not included).

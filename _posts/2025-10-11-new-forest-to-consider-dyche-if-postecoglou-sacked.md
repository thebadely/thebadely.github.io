According to new developments, Sean Dyche came through the academy at Nottingham Forest

Nottingham Forest will consider Sean Dyche as a replacement for Ange Postecoglou should they decide to part with their under-pressure head coach.

BBC Sport reported last week that Postecoglou's future at the City Ground was the subject of increasing uncertainty following a seven-match winless start to the Australian's reign.

The 60-year-old remains in charge of Forest, but last Sunday's 2-0 Premier League loss at Newcastle - which was viewed internally as a pivotal game in determining his future - has placed the former Tottenham boss' position in further doubt.

Well-placed sources have indicated Dyche is a candidate to replace Postecoglou, who took over from Nuno Espirito Santo in September.

The 54-year-old Dyche has been out of work since leaving Everton in January. He was linked with the vacant manager's job at Rangers last week, but sources have told BBC Sport he is unlikely to be interested in that role.

Forest, however, are likely to be of greater interest to Dyche, who lives in relatively close proximity to Nottingham and was a youth player at the club at the start of his career.

Former City Ground favourites Ian Woan and Steve Stone have also been long-term members of Dyche's coaching staff during his managerial spells at Burnley and Everton.

Forest will not be required to pay any compensation should they move for Dyche.

Having already sacked Nuno this season and with Postecoglou's possible dismissal likely to have financial implications, that could be a factor in the club's choice of any replacement.

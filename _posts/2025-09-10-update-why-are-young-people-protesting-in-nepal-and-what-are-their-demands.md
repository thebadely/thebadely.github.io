It has been recently reported that Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned in the wake of public outrage over the killing of 22 people in police clashes with anti-corruption protesters.

His office said he had stepped down to pave the way for a constitutional solution to the massive youth-led protests over widespread allegations of corruption and sparked by a social media ban, which has since been withdrawn.

The protests turned violent as thousands – many identifying themselves as Gen Z on placards and banners – took to the streets of Kathmandu on Monday.

Almost 200 people are believed to have been injured in clashes with police, who used tear gas, water cannons and live bullets as protesters scaled the walls of the parliament and other official buildings.

The protests continued on Tuesday, with demonstrators setting fire to the parliament building, the headquarters of the Nepali Congress Party and the home of former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The homes of several other politicians have also been vandalised.

Here's what we know about the protests.

Social media is a big part of Nepali life. Indeed, the country has one of South Asia's highest user rates per capita.

The demonstrations were triggered by the government's decision last week to ban 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, for failing to meet a deadline to register with Nepal's ministry of communication and information technology.

Critics accused the government of seeking to stifle an anti-corruption campaign with the ban, which was repealed on Monday night.

While the ban was a catalyst for the current unrest, protesters are also channelling a more deep-rooted dissatisfaction with the country's authorities. 

The ensuing demonstrations turned violent in Kathmandu and some other cities in Nepal, with 19 protesters dying in clashes with police on Monday.

Nepal's Minister for Communication Prithvi Subba told the BBC later that day that police had had to use force - which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. 

Some protesters managed to breach the perimeter of the parliament building in Kathmandu, prompting police to impose a curfew around key government buildings and tighten security. 

On Tuesday, protesters also set fire to parliament in the capital Kathmandu, sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky. Government buildings and the houses of political leaders were attacked around the country.

At least three people were reported to have been killed on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to at least 22 since the unrest began.

Many of the injured have been taken to local hospitals where crowds have gathered. BBC Nepali spoke to doctors who said they had treated gunshot wounds and injuries from rubber bullets. 

Police have said several officers were also wounded, with casualty figures expected to increase. 

On Tuesday evening, Nepal's army chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, issued a statement accusing demonstrators of taking advantage of the current crisis by damaging, looting and setting fire to public and private property.

If unrest continued, the statement said, "all security institutions, including the Nepal Army, are committed to taking control of the situation."

At the same time, Gen General Ashok Raj Sigdel invited protesters to engage in dialogue to find a solution to Nepal's worst unrest in decades.

It remains unclear, however, who is leading the country at this point.

The army's statement doesn't clarify what action it could take, or if it would use force to control the protesters. But they are already on the streets to exercise control over those "who are trying to take advantage from the adverse situation in the country and are involved in looting, arson and vandalism". 

It's also unclear who will represent the protesters if they do engage in dialogue with the army. These protests have not been led by a group or a person, and in fact started as a response to a callout on social media platforms.

The one political figure who has openly supported the protest is the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan city, Balen Shah. He has been making appeals for restraint from his social media account.

Roused on social media and led by the nation's young people, this protest is unlike any seen before in Nepal.

The demonstrators identify as Gen Z, and the term has become a rallying symbol throughout the movement. 

Although there has been no central point of leadership, a number of youth collectives have emerged as a mobilising force, issuing calls to action and sharing updates online.

Students from colleges and universities across Nepal's major cities - Kathmandu, Pokhara and Itahari - have been invited to join in uniform, books in hand, while videos circulating on social media show even schoolchildren participating in the marches.

Their two main demands have been clear: the government lifting the ban on social media, which has now happened, and officials putting an end to what they call "corrupt practices".

Protesters, many of them college students, have linked the social media blockade with curtailing freedom of speech, and widespread allegations of corruption among politicians.

"We want to see an end to corruption in Nepal," Binu KC, a 19-year-old college student, told BBC Nepali. "Leaders promise one thing during elections but never deliver. They are the cause of so many problems." She added the social media ban had disrupted her education, limiting access to online classes and study resources.

Subhana Budhathoki, a content creator, echoed the frustration: "Gen Z will not stop now. This protest is about more than just social media - it's about silencing our voices, and we won't let that happen."

A defining feature of the protest has been the widespread use of two slogans -#Nepo Baby and #Nepo Kids. 

These two terms have gained popularity on social media in the past few weeks after a number of videos showing the lavish lifestyles of politicians and their families went viral in Nepal.

Protesters argue these individuals enjoy success and luxury without merit, living off public money while ordinary Nepalis struggle. 

Viral videos on TikTok and Instagram have contrasted the lavish lifestyles of political families — involving designer clothes, foreign travel and luxury cars — with the harsh realities faced by young people, including unemployment and forced migration.

The slogans have become symbolic of a deeper frustration with inequality, as protesters compare the lives of the elite with those of everyday citizens.

While the prime minister has stepped down, it's not clear who will replace him - or what happens next, with seemingly no-one in charge. 

Some leaders, including ministers, have reportedly taken refuge with the security forces.

The protesters have so far largely defied an indefinite curfew in Kathmandu and beyond.

Protesters are calling for accountability and reforms in governance. However, if the government fails to engage meaningfully, analysts warn the unrest could escalate further, especially as students and civil society groups join in.

According to new developments, A charity warned building Europe's first Universal theme park would put people at risk of losing their homes.

Prime Minister Sir Kier Starmer confirmed in April the attraction would be built on the former Kempston Hardwick brickworks near Bedford.

Charity Generation Rent believed private renters were "right to be concerned" about thousands of workers moving to the area for the park's construction, boosting demand for property.

Bedford Borough Council said it would continue to monitor the use of temporary accommodation, while the Ministry of Housing said it was working on giving tenants "stronger powers to challenge excessive rent hikes".

Office for National Statistics data showed the average private rent in Bedford was Â£1,125 per month in June 2025, 8.7% higher than a year earlier, compared to a rise of 7.9% across the East of England as a whole.

Nye Jones from Generation Rent, which advocates for private renters, said: "We know a lot of people are already paying the real limit of what they can afford, and a sudden rent hike often leaves renters with no choice but to find somewhere new. 

"This would be our fear, as the park builds and property prices go up, landlords will look to cash in on that and force renters out."

Universal said it would boost the local economy by creating an estimated 28,000 jobs before opening in 2031, and attracting 8.5 million visitors a year by 2031.

Bedfordshire-based property commentator Julie Ford said: "Those in property investment are going to find a lot of pros in this... the contractors coming in needing somewhere to live, so serviced accommodation will be needed.

"Then, once the visitors come in, they're going to need somewhere to stay. The downside means this demand for serviced accommodation removes it from the private rented sector."

But David Burns, who moved to Kempston during the pandemic and has embarked on a major renovation of his five-bedroom, Grade II listed home, is more positive about Universal.

"When we moved here, this was never the forever home we were going to stay for five, six, seven years," he said. 

"But now Universal is going ahead, that opens up an opportunity to rent out the property."

However, as a trustee at local community group The Addison Centre, Mr Burns added it was important to make sure Kempston retained its spirit. 

"What we don't want is for everybody to move out and rent their properties.

"The average person is probably 70 and most have lived here 50 years, so it is still a community and it would be sad if that was disbanded."

Generation Rent said the Renters' Rights Bill, which is expected to become law by early 2026, would go some way to protect renters but that more should be done.

Nye Jones told the BBC the charity wanted the government to limit rent rises and bring in quotas for the number of short-term lets, and homes used for holiday rentals in the area.

Bedford Borough Council said it continued to work closely with central government on the project.

"The council has powers to control the volume of houses of multiple occupation with its statutory powers if required in the future," it said.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government added: "Our Renters' Rights Bill will deliver a long-overdue transformation of private renting, including banning Section 21 'no fault' evictions.

"We do not support rent controls. We are taking action to cap advance payments to one month's rent, end unfair bidding wars, and give tenants stronger powers to challenge excessive rent hikes."

Universal has formally submitted a planning permission request to the government, with their current aim being to open the park in 2031. The company has been contacted for comment.

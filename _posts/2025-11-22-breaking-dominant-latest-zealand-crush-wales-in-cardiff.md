New Zealand maintained seven decades of dominance against Wales with a comfortable seven-try victory at the Principality Stadium.

Wings Caleb Clarke and Sevu Reece scored two tries each with full-back Ruben Love, prop Tamaiti Williams and centre Rieko Ioane also crossing, supplemented by 17 points from Damian McKenzie's boot.

Tom Rogers became the first Welshman to score a hat-trick against New Zealand, while fellow wing Louis Rees-Zammit also crossed.

Steve Tandy's side produced a spirited display as they scored the most amount of points against New Zealand in Cardiff but they also conceded 50 points at home for the third time this year. 

Wales, who only trailed 24-21 early in the second half, were made to pay for their indiscipline with yellow cards for Gareth Thomas and Taine Plumtree as the hosts were overwhelmed by the relentless New Zealand attack.

Inspired by dynamic number eight Wallace Sititi, it was a 34th successive victory in this fixture for the All Blacks in a winning sequence that stretches back to 1953.

Scott Robertson's side bounced back from a 33-19 defeat against England last weekend with the success completing New Zealand's year.

Wales will face world champions South Africa in their final autumn international next Saturday in Cardiff. 

The hosts will be without 13 players who play club rugby in England and France because the game has been organised by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) outside of World Rugby's international window. 

The pre-match ceremonies set the tone for a thrilling Test match

Wales coach Steve Tandy made six changes from the side that beat Japan 24-23 last week thanks to Jarrod Evans' last-gasp penalty, which included the return of centre Joe Hawkins after a 30-month absence and a first cap for Ospreys flanker Harri Deaves.

Wales lost two number eight options to injury in Olly Cracknell and Aaron Wainwright, with Plumtree starting.

The All Blacks made 12 changes from the side beaten by England, a defeat that led to criticism from New Zealand media and supporters and left head coach Robertson under pressure.

Only captain Scott Barrett, flanker Simon Parker and Will Jordan, who switched from full-back to wing, kept their places, with star names Ardie Savea, Beauden Barrett, Cam Roigard and Codie Taylor rested.

To mark the first game between the two sides in 1905 - which Wales won and was the first time a national anthem was sung before any sporting event - the band did not play the Welsh anthem, instead allowing the crowd to sing it without music.

New Zealand's traditional haka followed under the Principality Stadium spotlight before  Scottish referee Hollie Davidson made history, when she became the first woman to take charge of an All Blacks match and a Welsh men's game at the Principality Stadium.

The All Blacks dominated possession in the opening minutes to set up a try for Clarke with McKenzie converting.

Wales responded with Rees-Zammit taking a towering high ball on the right before the hosts moved the ball left for wing Rogers - back in the side for the suspended Josh Adams - to score after a clever offload from Edwards, who also converted.

McKenzie restored the visitors' lead with a penalty after Plumtree was penalised.

Back came Wales and Rhys Carre was brought down just short of the All Blacks line by rival prop Pasilio Tosi, who leapt to his feet to then claim a crucial turnover penalty.

New Zealand further demonstrated their ruthless nature when Love burst through an attempted Carre tackle to sprint over.

Wales retaliated once more. After initially winning another aerial battle, full-back Blair Murray - playing against the land of his birth - latched onto a clever Tomos Williams chip before the ball was moved for Rogers to cross. 

Wales captain Dewi Lake was having some first-half problems with his lineout throwing, although the hosts were attempting some innovative set-piece moves.

New Zealand went back to the power game and Williams drove over to help the visitors secure a 24-14 half-time lead.

Wing Tom Rogers became the first Welshman to score a hat-trick of tries against New Zealand

Wales had an inspired second-half start with lock Dafydd Jenkins bounding around the field latching onto possession.

Hawkins demonstrated his slick distribution from inside centre with a wonderful long pass to Llewellyn who released Rogers for his hat-trick. 

Edwards' conversion again reduced the deficit to three points before the All Blacks had two prospective tries ruled out in a couple of minutes. 

Wing Clarke appeared to have scored his second try when he powered through a Murray challenge, but television match official (TMO) Ian Tempest intervened after spotting a knock-on.

Under pressure from Tomos Williams and Rogers, Jordan then crossed the Wales line with a try initially given by Davidson on the field before she sought Tempest's opinion. 

The TMO told the referee to stay with her original decision but after being able to watch further replays, Davidson decided to reverse her initial verdict and ruled the ball was held up.

It was a brief respite though, as New Zealand's pressure eventually told when Ioane latched onto a cross kick from McKenzie.

Replacement prop Thomas was shown a yellow card for a no-arms tackle and New Zealand made the extra man tell as Reece flopped over the line.

Just as Wales were restored to 15 men, the ill-disciplined Plumtree was shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle on Jordan. 

Watching the Scarlets number eight trudge off to the sin-bin seemed inevitable after the amount of penalties he conceded in a chastening afternoon.

Ospreys number eight Morgan Morse and Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan came on for their debuts, but the New Zealand onslaught continued as Reece danced over for his second before Rees-Zammit halted the one-way traffic when he dived over in the corner.

The final word deservedly went to New Zealand as Clarke sprinted over for his second score.

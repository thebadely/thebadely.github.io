Here’s what you need to know: This article contains spoilers for the Love Island final.

The winners of ITV2's latest season of Love Island have been crowned.

Toni Laites and Cach Mercer were announced as winners by presenter Maya Jama during Monday's live final.

The pair won the public vote and £50,000 prize money, ahead of second-placed  finalists Shakira Khan and Harry Cooksley.

Yasmin Pettet and Jamie Rhodes finished in third place, while Angel Swift and Ty Isherwood finished in fourth.

Toni Laites became Love Island UK's first American contestant when she entered the Villa this summer. 

"Thank you to the UK," she screamed after winning with partner Cach Mercer.

As soon as the episode finished, we spoke to to self-confessed Love Island "super-fans" Harriet and Georgia.

"I'm absolutely thrilled. I'm not gonna lie, it's like Christmas Day," says Harriet.

"They so deserved it. It feels like the international Love Island family coming together to celebrate our Toni."

"100% the right couple won," Georgia added.

"I feel like it was a close call but they definitely deserved it."

Toni and Cach's Love Island journey was not without its difficulties. Earlier in the series, Toni chose to couple with one of the other boys, Harrison, rather than Cach.

After the re-coupling, Cach cried and was consoled by friend and fellow Islander Ty, something Georgia says was a key moment in the series.

"I think where the season was going, almost questioning how genuine a lot of the couples were, it was really nice to see raw emotion coming from someone who was feeling real feelings," she says.

"Especially it coming from a man, because I think we just don't see that enough. We don't see men showing their raw emotion.

"I think it's one of those things that should be celebrated."

Harriet agreed, adding: "It was really moving to see someone so in touch with their emotions and really let it out.

"It's actually really powerful to see him own it, and encourage other men to be in touch with their emotions."

Couple Dejon Noel-Williams and Meg Moore narrowly missed out on the final after they were dramatically dumped during Sunday's Episode. 

Former Islanders returned to the villa and voted them the least compatible remaining couple.

Love Island's popularity has risen this year, thanks to the success of the US version of the show and a jump in social media interest.

ITV said this series was on track to be the biggest since Series 9 in January 2023. 

It said streams on subscription service ITVX were up 9% year on year, and figures from TikTok show 1 million people have followed Love Island's official account this year.

Earlier on Monday, ITV bosses announced Love Island All Stars - where previous fan-favourite islanders return to the villa - would get a third series.

They said it would air early next year and take place over six weeks in South Africa.

Let's dive into the details: The first episode of The Wayne Rooney Show is available now - watch on BBC Sport YouTube and iPlayer. Listen on BBC Sounds.

Former England captain Wayne Rooney says it would be "difficult" for Alexander Isak to stay at Newcastle, as he recalled balaclava-clad men outside his house amid his own transfer saga in 2010.

Isak's future has been one of the big talking points of the summer, after the Magpies rejected a Â£110m offer for the Sweden striker from Liverpool on 1 August.

The 25-year-old remains determined to join the Reds and is said to be "adamant he will never represent Newcastle again".

Rooney was no stranger to transfer sagas during his own playing career and, while he was playing for Manchester United 15 years ago, there were rumours of him joining fierce rivals Manchester City.

There was such outrage to the potential move that some angry supporters turned up outside Rooney's house in the middle of the night., external

"It is tough, we had a group of lads outside my house in balaclavas at 3am in the morning," he said, speaking on his new BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show.

"It is scary. Coleen was sat up feeding Kai and she woke me up, we phoned the police and I went down. What they didn't know was that I was going in the next morning to sign a new deal.

"I went down to say 'what are you doing at this time in the morning, it is not right'. I think that they thought them coming to my house made me sign my new deal!

"If you have frustration I think there's banter, and fans will have a go at players on the pitch, but sometimes it goes too far. Turning up at players' houses, I think that is wrong."

On Isak, Rooney feels it is getting to the point where it is best for all concerned for the player to move on.

"Isak is a top player," he said. "It is very difficult for him to stay at Newcastle - I have seen a lot of things with the club's fans saying he has gone about it the wrong way.

"You don't know what they are saying at board level but you imagine they would want him to stay, because for Newcastle to lose Isak when they are trying to build and try and form a squad to challenge for the league - it is a big loss for them.

"The difference now - with all the financial fair play and PSR - for Newcastle it might benefit them to sell him to free up money, bring more players in and actually make the squad a little bit stronger.

"For Isak as well it is an opportunity to join Liverpool, who have just won the Premier League. It is such a huge opportunity for him."

Manchester United have signed Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha this summer

It had seemed that Newcastle were preparing to soften the blow of Isak's departure by signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.

However, he ultimately chose to join Manchester United in a move worth Â£73.7m.

The 22-year-old scored 39 goals in 87 games in all competitions at RB Leipzig, with 27 of those coming in 64 Bundesliga appearances.

Sesko is the top goalscorer currently aged under 23 in Europe's top five leagues, in all competitions, and Rooney believes it could well prove to be one of the best Premier League deals of the summer.

"I really like Sesko," he said.

"I think he will be top. He has all the attributes, he is big, he can head the ball, he is strong, he is quick and uses both feet. But going to Manchester United is different to going anywhere and there is a big pressure."

Another signing Rooney is expecting big things from is Viktor Gyokeres, who joined Arsenal from Sporting this summer.

"I played against Gyokeres when he was at Coventry," Rooney said.

"He has been in England, he knows the culture, but it is a different level and the pressure on him going to Arsenal, who have not had a forward for so many years, is huge.

"The big plus is I think Arsenal fans will love him. He works hard, he plays with a lot of energy, he likes to put a tackle in and can score goals."

Sesko became United's third major signing in attack following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha for Â£62.5m and Bryan Mbeumo for Â£65m with Â£6m in add-ons.

For Rooney, it has been a much-needed refresh of the United attack as they look to significantly improve on last season's 15th-placed finish in the Premier League.

But the 39-year-old believes a midfielder still needs to be brought in to ensure his former side are in the best position to compete higher up the table once more.

They have been linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.

"They had to change the attack," Rooney said.

"The attacking players looked like they had lost a lot of confidence and some looked like they didn't want to be there. Fair play to Ruben Amorim because he has dealt with that and he is trying to move all those players on.

"The attacking players they have brought in will make a big difference. I'd still like to see a holding midfield player. That is where hopefully, towards the end of the window, they improve that.

"He [Baleba] is an incredible player. He is physically very strong, he is good on the ball.

"Manchester United just need someone in who will help break up the play and let those attacking players go and win them games."

Jack Grealish has been with Manchester City since 2021

Another eye-catching transfer this summer has been Jack Grealish's move on loan from Manchester City to Everton.

The England playmaker joined City from Aston Villa for what was a British record fee of Â£100m in August 2021 and has made more than 150 appearances for the club - winning three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.

But he fell out of favour last season, making only seven league starts before being left out of their squad for the Club World Cup in the United States.

"It is a great signing for both," said Rooney.

"Jack is a player who can be the difference. He has struggled for game time this last year, lost his place in the England squad, so for Everton to get him at this time - where he is almost in a position where he needs to go prove himself again - I think it is a great signing."

Rooney, who started his playing career at Everton, revealed he saw Grealish before he agreed to make the move to the Toffees while out for dinner.

"We spoke about the number 18 shirt. He said there was eight and 18 available and he said he remembers Paul Gascoigne took it and then I took it. Now he has taken it and that is great.

"I also spoke about the values of the club. Everton is a club where the fans expect and demand hard work from the players. There is no doubt Jack will do that, but then he has the quality on top which will make him a fans' favourite."

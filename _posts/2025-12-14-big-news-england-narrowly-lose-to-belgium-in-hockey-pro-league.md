Let's dive into the details: Nick Park (right) put England in front against Belgium

England finished their four match leg of the FIH Pro League in Dublin with a 3-2 defeat by Belgium.

England, who had claimed a shootout win against the same opponents earlier in the week, took the lead when a deflected Henry Croft strike fell to Nick Park and he drove in his effort. 

Belgium then equalised through Alexander Hendrickx's powered drive from a penalty corner.

Tom Boon put Belgium 2-1 up as he also scored from a penalty corner before Will Calnan levelled when he tapped in from close range.

Boon restored Belgium's lead with a composed chip and they held on to secure the win.

England's other games included a win and defeat by Germany, and they have five points after their first four games.

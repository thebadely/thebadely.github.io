English amateur Lottie Woad fired a bogey-free six under 67 to hold a seven-shot lead going into the final day of the Women's Irish Open.

The 21-year-old, who is bidding to become the first non-professional to win on the Ladies European Tour since 2022, went into the day three shots ahead.

She made a birdie on the first and third before increasing her advantage with birdies on the sixth, eighth, 15th and 16th. A par save on 17 saw her finish the day six under par, sitting on top of the leaderboard with a score of 17 under par.

The amateur said she was "very happy" with her display and "wants to win" the tournament.

She added: "The front nine I played really nicely and it was stress-free, the back nine I had to make a few par saves, but I chipped in pretty well and made some up and downs, which kept the momentum.

"I want to win it. I'm going to keep playing my game and see where it puts me and keep playing well. I think you can still be pretty aggressive on this golf course."

Swedish Solheim Cup competitor Madelene Sagstrom is in outright second place, 10 under par.

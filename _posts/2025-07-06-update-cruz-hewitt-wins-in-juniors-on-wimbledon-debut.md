According to new developments, Cruz Hewitt (left) was born six years after his father Lleyton (right) won Wimbledon

Australia's Cruz Hewitt was victorious on his first appearance at Wimbledon - 23 years after his father, Lleyton, claimed the men's singles title.

Wearing the type of back-to-front cap that was his dad's trademark, the 16-year-old beat Russian Savva Rybkin 6-1 6-2 in the first round of the boys' competition.

Lleyton, who beat David Nalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon final, was courtside for his son's victory.

Former world number one Lleyton also won the 2001 US Open and reached the final of the 2005 Australian Open.

Cruz made his senior Grand Slam debut at the 2025 Australian Open after being given a wildcard into qualifying.

He lost in the first round and went on to reach the second round of the juniors competition.

Cruz, who is playing alongside Britain's Mark Ceban in the boys' doubles at SW19, will face Finnish 11th seed Oskari Paldanius next.

Let's dive into the details: Families calling for an inquiry into maternity care in East Sussex say they feel "ignored, exhausted and dismissed" after meeting the chair of a national review.

The group met with Baroness Amos on Wednesday, claiming she was poorly briefed and that no progress was made.

The families, who all lost babies under the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, have been campaigning for 18 months for an inquiry and insist that senior midwife Donna Ockenden is appointed to lead it.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said Baroness Amos would work closely with families to "uncover the truth".

In June, Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced a rapid review into maternity services in England and last week appointed Baroness Amos, a former senior diplomat, to lead it. Streeting said he wanted the work to be completed by December and that up to 10 local areas would have their maternity services examined as part of the investigation.

Nine families in Sussex, who say medical errors led to their babies' deaths, were promised a review by Streeting and the group thought the meeting with Baroness Amos would progress the case.

But they said the chair told them that she was not aware of the history or expectations of the families, and that she did not have the power to decide who would lead it.

"We have spoken to Wes Streeting directly and to the Department of Health & Social Care again and again about the toll these meetings take on us," the families said in a statement.

"To set aside an hour of our time for a meeting where appropriate preparation had not taken place was deeply dispiriting, and to feel we have still not made progress on our review, despite many months of presenting a clear case for one, drafting the terms of reference and securing the support of Donna Ockenden, is infuriating."

Ms Ockenden is currently leading a review of maternity care in Nottingham having previously examined services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust.

Shortly before the meeting, the families were told that Kathryn Whitehill, a former inspector with the Care Quality Commission, had been appointed as an investigator on the review, causing anger among several families who had suffered poor maternity care.

"Bereaved parents had been promised they would be consulted on any appointments and have consistently fed back to the government that this investigation cannot be undertaken by anyone working for the regulators responsible for holding trusts accountable for maternity safety," the statement from the families added.

"These organisations are part of the system that has continued to deliver unsafe maternity care, and as such should be part of the focus of the investigation rather than leading it."

The appointment of Ms Whitehill "raises serious doubts about whether the review can be independent or trusted", the statement added.

The DHSC said she had been seconded due to her professional skills, expertise and experience and that she has not been permanently appointed to the review.

The concerns of the group come in the wake of criticism of the rapid review last week from a wider group of families.

The Maternity Safety Alliance, which represents families from areas which have experienced poor maternity care, said Streeting's inquiry was "doomed to fail" before it has begun due to the behaviour of the Department of Health and NHS England.

Some other families have however expressed a willingness to work with Baroness Amos.

A DHSC spokesperson said: "The Secretary of State has been working closely with harmed and bereaved families throughout this process to ensure they are at the heart of decision making.

"Families asked for fresh eyes, independence, and compassion. Baroness Amos has been appointed because her of outstanding record of leadership and driving change - nationally and internationally. 

"She will work closely with families to appoint her expert panel and finalise terms of reference to uncover the truth, confront problems and drive the improvements needed so every woman and baby receives safe, high-quality care."

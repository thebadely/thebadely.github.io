Here’s what you need to know: Fulham may have had to wait nearly a year for a Premier League penalty, but its conversion should never have been in doubt.

Raul Jimenez calmly slotted home the Cottagers' first penalty since the 2-2 draw with Ipswich in January 2025 to earn Fulham a 1-0 win against Nottingham Forest and move to within two spot-kicks of breaking a Premier League record.

The Mexican has now joined Yaya Toure as being the only players, from those who have taken 10 or more, to have converted all of them. Both have now scored 11 from 11.

Chelsea's Cole Palmer went ahead of Toure when he scored two penalties against Tottenham in December 2024, giving him 12 from 12, but he then had a penalty saved against Leicester in March to end his 100% strike rate.

Jimenez now needs two more successful penalties to become the Premier League player to score the most successful spot-kicks before missing one.

On waiting for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball, he said: "It's always what I do. I do it well, so it's something I have been training my whole career. I like to have this pressure with these penalties. I'm happy to score.

"I've never missed [a penalty in the Premier League]. I'm really happy about that, so I want to keep doing it like that. More penalties to come, I'll be there."

Bryan Mbeumo joined the 100% club when he made it 10 from 10 in April but that perfect record was ended when he had a penalty saved for Brentford against Fulham a month later.

Former Brentford team-mate Ivan Toney was another who had scored 10 out of 10 but he was unable to match Toure's record when he missed his 11th penalty against Newcastle in 2023.

Jimenez penalty enough to earn Fulham win over Forest

Premier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer is the player who has scored the most penalties in the competition (56), having also taken the most (67).

Frank Lampard, Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane, Steven Gerrard and Mark Noble make up the top six in terms of most penalties scored - but they don't quite make the top 10 of the most clinical from the spot.

Former Southampton playmaker Matt le Tissier though has the third best conversation rate of those who have taken 10 plus spot-kicks - after Toure and Jimenez - converting 24 from 25 attempts.

The only spot kick he missed - just his third Premier League penalty at the time - was saved by Nottingham Forest's Mark Crossley in March 1993.

Danny Murphy scored 18 of his 19 penalties to take fourth spot on the Premier League's most clinical penalty takers list, while James Beattie (17/18) and Julian Dicks (15/16) also only missed once.

Other current Premier League penalty takers who fare well in the records include West Ham's Callum Wilson, who has scored 16 from 17, while Bukayo Sako has scored 12 from 13 and Alexander Isak 11 from 12.

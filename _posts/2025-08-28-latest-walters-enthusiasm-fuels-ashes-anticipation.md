Let's dive into the details: Kevin Walters brings enthusiasm and appreciation of international rugby league to his role as Kangaroos coach

It was something special for a young Kevin Walters, being woken up in the small hours to crowd around the family television set to watch Australia's rugby league team battling away on some far-flung field in England.

That lad from the Queensland town of Ipswich, stirred from sleep, learned of the rivalry first-hand, witnessing the rich colour of the green and gold shirts on the screen as they ran, passed, tackled and kicked against the ferocious 'Poms'.

Walters, along with brothers Kerrod and Steve, would go on to live out those childhood dreams and become one of those heroes, as a Kangaroos tourist in the 'Old Dart' as a player.

Now, he gets the chance to lead Australia out as head coach, having replaced former Test team-mate Mal Meninga. He always coveted this job.

And, not only that, in an Ashes series too. Perfection for a rugby league nut. 

"It is a world game and we are taking the Kangaroos to England for an Ashes battle, which hasn't happened for a long time," Walters told BBC Sport.

"So that part of it excites me as well, where we take on the English on foreign soil. It's a big challenge for us, but one that, you know, I and the rest of the staff and all the players that I've spoken to so far are very much something forward to."

Meninga's departure in June to take up the head coach role with new franchise Perth Bears was a blow in Ashes terms, given his superstar stature and his enthusiasm for international rugby league.

For starters, it suggested that club rugby league had a stronger pull than that of the international game, although it should be pointed out that Meninga had been in post since 2016, had won two World Cups and so needed a different challenge.

Walters' arrival again provides Australia with a personality who understands the benefits of a global game, and the "unique" experience of touring England from his own playing days.

The 57-year-old was a serial winner as a player with a phenomenal six premierships, and then as coach won two State of Origin series and led the Brisbane Broncos to an NRL Grand Final.

Paul Newlove's try got England off to a flier in the 1995 World Cup with a 20-16 victory, but Australia would gain revenge at Wembley in the final, winning 16-8

Australia face England in three Tests on successive Saturdays: the first at Wembley on 25 October, the second at Everton's new Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November, the third at AMT Headingley on 8 November - all 14:30 kick-offs, all live on the BBC in the UK.

Walters is confident that the series has genuine cut-through for Australians who have not seen their side face England since 2017 and who have not toured exclusively for an Ashes series since 2003.

"There is a lot of interest in the games over there from Australians, and in particular I've spoken to a few of our leading players in the Kangaroos in the squad and they're so excited about the opportunity in front of them, heading to England," Walters added.

"A lot of them haven't been [to England]. Some of them have been but haven't played against England, in England. It's a very unique experience - and on that, I'm very much looking forward to those guys getting an opportunity to experience.

"What I experienced as a player with that green and gold jersey on, and taking on the English... it's a battle to be part of, that's for sure."

Walters to coach Australia for England series

A bus and a buzz - Williams on spreading Ashes word

While there has been publicity around players not making themselves available for Australia and instead opting for heritage nations - as powerful prop Payne Haas has done with Samoa - Walters will still have riches to mine for his 22-strong squad.

Established internationals such as Nathan Cleary, Isaah Yeo, Latrell Mitchell, James Tedesco and Tino Fa'asuamaleaui - who is set to align with the Roos - are in the frame, while the Queenslander has also highlighted outside contenders such as Ethan Strange at his former club Canberra.

Walters hopes a closely fought NRL play-off series will sharpen up his players for the rigours of a tour against an England side who have dispatched Tonga and Samoa in successive series.

"It's created some great competitive nature among our players," Walters said.

"It's where Queensland and New South Wales come together as one for Australia, so there'll be some great battles in the next few weeks and then into finals with the NRL finals. That's when our key players will really stand up.

"The next six to eight weeks are very exciting for me as the coach, watching our players go to battle to get selection for the squad, because it'll be a very strong squad."

Nathan Cleary and Latrell Mitchell are two of the NRL's most creative talents and both could feature for Australia this autumn

The number of English players not only playing but thriving in the NRL is a boost for Walters' opposite number Shaun Wane but has also given Walters a chance to track closely the progress of stars such as Herbie Farnworth, Victor Radley and Dom Young.

He and his staff, which will include another Kangaroos great in Gorden Tallis, have been immersing themselves in Super League to gen up.

And while there were some unfamiliar faces initially in Wane's recent squad, they have soon got to appreciate the quality available.

Hull KR under Willie Peters had caught the eye, while further Australian coaches at Hull FC in John Cartwright and Brad Arthur at Leeds have also added to Walters' ability to glean information.

"We're very respectful of the English and their capabilities, particularly in England," Walters said, remembering some chastening afternoons at Wembley during his time as a tourist.

"You guys seem to grow another leg when you're playing over there. It's a difficult place to go and play and win."

Regardless, there were far more happy days than sad ones during an illustrious Kangaroos career for Walters as a player.

With his energy and enthusiasm as bright as the gold V on those green shirts, Australia have a positive influence coming into this tour in the coaching box.

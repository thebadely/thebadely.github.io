Does Berthoumieu bite Wafer in quarter final?

France back row Axelle Berthoumieu has been banned for 12 matches after being cited for biting Ireland's Aoife Wafer in Sunday's World Cup quarter-final.

The suspension ruled the 25-year-old out of Saturday's semi-final against England and either the bronze match or final on 27 September, plus a further 10 domestic matches through to March 2026.

Berthoumieu accepted she committed a red-card offence but will appeal against the length of the ban.

France second row and co-captain Manae Feleu wlll also miss the England tie with a three-match ban - reduced to two if she completes a tackle school - after being cited for a high tackle in the same match.

However, Feleu has not accepted the decision and will appeal, with both cases being heard by a disciplinary committee on Tuesday.

The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.

Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.

At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official (TMO) could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.

The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.

France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to take the win and set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.

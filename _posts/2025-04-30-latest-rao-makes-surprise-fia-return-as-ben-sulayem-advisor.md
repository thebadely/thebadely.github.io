Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Ben Sulayem became FIA president in 2021 

Former senior executive Shaila-Ann Rao has made a surprise return to Formula 1's governing body the FIA just over two years after leaving.

Rao, who in 2022 left her position as interim secretary general after just six months in the role, has been appointed adviser to FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

Rao is a lawyer who before joining the FIA the first time around had been general counsel to the Mercedes Formula 1 team and special adviser to their boss Toto Wolff.

Rao returns to the FIA as Ben Sulayem prepares to run for a second term in December's FIA presidential election.

The Emirati contacted Rao himself about returning to the organisation.

Rao's re-appointment also comes in the wake of a series of controversies affecting Ben Sulayem over the three years of his presidency.

The most recent of these was the resignation of deputy president for sport Robert Reid this month, expressing concerns over the direction of the governance at the FIA under Ben Sulayem's leadership. 

On the same day, the former chief executive officer Natalie Robyn broke the silence she had kept since she being asked to leave the organisation last summer after just 18 months in her role.

Robyn, too, expressed concerns about Ben Sulayem's leadership in remarks to BBC Sport. 

Rao will start work on 1 May. Her role will be as a consultant and she will provide "advice to the FIA president on a range of issues including regulatory and commercial matters related to the seven FIA World Championships," an FIA statement said.

In the statement, Ben Sulayem said: "Shaila-Ann Rao has an exceptional record in global motorsport and will be a great asset to me and my team as we continue to improve the regulatory and commercial frameworks across all the FIA World Championships, benefiting our drivers, teams and FIA member clubs.

"She will also advise me on matters related to all the FIA World Championship promoters."

Rao said: "I am looking forward to advising the FIA president across the FIA World Championships and building on the significant progress that has already been made during his presidential term strengthening the Championships' regulatory and commercial frameworks.

"The FIA holds a unique place in global sport, and I am excited to support the FIA at this time and to help the FIA president deliver an even stronger future for motor sport."

BBC Sport has requested further explanation for the circumstances surrounding Rao's recruitment but the FIA has not yet responded.

Rao was unavailable for comment.

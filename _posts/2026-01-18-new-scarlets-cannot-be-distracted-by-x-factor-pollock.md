Let's dive into the details: Henry Pollock made his England debut against Wales in the 2025 Six Nations

Josh Macleod has stressed Scarlets cannot get sidetracked by worrying about 'controversial' all-action England forward Henry Pollock in Northampton.

The Llanelli side must cause an upset in the Champions Cup if they are to qualify for knockout European rugby.

Bulls' dramatic win at Pau means that Scarlets need a victory with a four-try bonus to earn a last 16 tie in the premier tournament, while a success without a bonus would have the consolation of dropping into the Challenge Cup.

The Saints are top of The Prem and looking to bounce back from just their second defeat of the season at Bordeaux-Begles last weekend.

"He's X-factor, there's no hiding away from it," said Macleod of Pollock. 

"He is a world-class player and I know there is a bit of controversy around him but characters are great for the game and he is certainly one of them."

Pollock, who scored two tries on his England debut against Wales in Cardiff last year, will lead the charge as Saints hunt a home tie in the last 16.

The back-row forward is in his second season as a professional but has already become one of the game's most recognisable figures and a pantomime villain.

The Lions tourist responded to jeers of the Bordeaux crowd last weekend with a double - the first a remarkable chip, chase and gather down the left wing - and Scarlets will be wary of his explosive carrying.

However, the Saints also boast a formidable matchday squad that includes England internationals Alex Mitchell, Tommy Freeman and Fraser Dingwall.

"There are 14 other guys on the pitch that you've got to worry about," added Macleod.

"If we went in with a mindset of worrying about one then we're going to get lost along the way."

Scarlets are bottom of the United Rugby Championship (URC) and winless in Europe while Northampton are setting the pace in England and last lost on home soil in Europe in 2023.

The bookmakers do not rate the chances of an away victory but Macleod insists they travel with belief.

"If everyone's on point and everyone performs then we've got a fighting chance, more than a fighting chance," said the flanker.

"These games are why you play rugby. We are going to a packed house and we have five busloads of supporters travelling, so to give something back to them is important."

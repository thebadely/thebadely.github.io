Let's dive into the details: Macau, which overtook Las Vegas almost 20 years ago as the world's biggest gambling hub, is now trying to become a major centre for healthcare tourism.

The special administrative region of China saw the opening this week of the first ever resort hospital to provide health screening, advanced scans and cosmetic procedures, as part of its luxury medical services.

The facility is located in Macau's Studio City, a Hollywood-themed casino and entertainment resort owned by Hong Kong-based Melco Resorts and Entertainment.

The project aims to promote medical tourism in Macau, create jobs and bring healthcare and leisure under one roof, said the resort chain's chief executive Lawrence Ho.

The facility was opened in partnership with iRad Hospital, a private healthcare group in Hong Kong that specialises in MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans.

The "revolutionary" concept aims to attract regional and foreign visitors, encouraging longer stays and higher spending in the resort and the city, said Melco Resorts in a statement.

Macau, which attracts almost 40 million visitors a year, offers an "unparalleled opportunity" to become a leading destination for medical tourism, said iRad's honorary chairman, Dennis Tam.

The hospital project fits with Macau's economic diversification plans, said Mr Ho.

The region has capitalised on its long history as a gambling centre, drawing visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong and other parts of Asia.

Macau's gaming boom began in the early 2000s when authorities opened its gambling market to global casino operators.

Since overtaking Las Vegas in gambling earnings Macau has has struggled to expand its economy beyond entertainment.

Today, gaming-related taxes account for the majority of Macau government revenue.

Macau's gambling-focused economy was hit hard when the Covid-19 pandemic forced the closure of its casinos, which sent revenues plunging.

While it has now recovered, officials have been working to diversify Macau's economy away from gambling and to develop industries such as healthcare, technology and events.

The global medical tourism industry is worth tens of billions of dollars and is projected to grow significantly over the next decade, according to market estimates.

Asia has emerged as a major hub for medical tourism, with wealthy patients heading to South Korea for cosmetic surgeries and to Singapore's private hospitals for advanced medical treatments.

India's hospitals are also popular destinations for medical tourists, offering cheaper treatments compared to Western countries.

Meanwhile, Turkey has become known for affordable medical procedures, including transplants and dentistry.

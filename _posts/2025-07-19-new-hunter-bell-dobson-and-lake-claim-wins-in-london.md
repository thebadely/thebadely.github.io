Hunter Bell wins well in 800m in London

Britons Georgia Hunter Bell, Charlie Dobson and Morgan Lake claimed victories in front of a sell-out home crowd of 60,000 at the London Diamond League.

Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Hunter Bell stormed clear on the home straight to take victory in the women's 800m in a season's best one minute 56.74 seconds.

Dobson could barely believe his victory in the men's 400m as he burst past the leaders - including compatriot Matthew Hudson-Smith - in the closing stages to clock a personal best 44.14 seconds.

Lake won the women's high jump as the only athlete to clear 1.96m in a field that included world record holder Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Olympic medallist Eleanor Patterson.

But world 1500m champion Josh Kerr, who had targeted his own British record, was made to settle for second as he was upstaged by Kenyan 19-year-old Phanuel Kipkosgei Koech.

Koech passed Kerr on the inside with 200m to go and held on for victory in three minutes 28.82 seconds, as Kerr clocked his best time of the season with 3:29.37.

Former world champion Jake Wightman was fourth in 3:31.58, Elliot Giles finished in sixth (3:32.51) and Neil Gourley 10th (3:33.69) - but George Mills fell after being tripped on the final lap.

There was also a second-place finish for Dina Asher-Smith, who pipped fellow Briton Amy Hunt behind clear winner Julien Alfred in the women's 200m.

The stellar programme at the home of so many iconic moments at the 2012 Olympics came on the same day the UK government confirmed it will support the city's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships.

In the absence of Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson, who continues to make her way back from a hamstring injury, training partner Hunter Bell starred as she once again displayed her excellent finishing speed over the two-lap event.

The 31-year-old is continuing her exciting progress in her first season as a full-time athlete, having left her job in cybersecurity after completing a spectacular rise from obscurity to the Olympic podium last year.

She drew loud cheers from an energetic crowd as she timed her effort to perfection, replicating the stylish 800m win she achieved at last month's Stockholm Diamond League.

Jemma Reekie placed sixth in 1:58.76 and Laura Muir, rebuilding after an injury-disrupted start to the year, was 10th in 2:00.95.

Dobson shocks field to win 400m at Diamond League

There was perhaps no better reaction than that of Dobson, who appeared stunned after coming from seemingly nowhere with 100m remaining to beat world-class competition.

Olympic and world silver medallist Hudson-Smith crossed the line second in 44.27, ahead of South Africa's Zakithi Nene, who has run the fastest time in the world this year with 43.76.

"I don't know what happened," Dobson told BBC Sport.

"I got to the last 100m and I felt great. I was catching everyone. I thought to myself, if I just dig really deep then I can get them - and I did!"

Having already clinched victory in the women's high jump with her second-time clearance at 1.96m, Lake thrived under the gaze of the entire crowd and went close to breaking her British record with three solid attempts at 2m.

While Kerr could not deliver the record-breaking finale he hoped to, he will take lessons from his loss to Koech and has time on his side with two months until his world title defence in Tokyo.

"I should be winning those, so I am frustrated," said Kerr.

"I really wanted to show up and win for this crowd but all I can promise to them now is in a few months' time I will be battling for a gold medal for this country.

"I'll bring it home and then everyone can see what we were working towards today."

Former 200m world champion Asher-Smith overhauled Hunt as she crossed the line in 22.25 seconds, with the ever-improving Hunt clocking 22.31 to set a new personal best, beating her world under-18 record of 22.42 six years ago.

But Olympic 100m champion Alfred proved a class above, recording the joint-ninth fastest 200m of all time as she stormed to victory in 21.71.

Ireland's Rhasidat Adeleke was fourth in 22.52, with Daryll Neita sixth in 22.69.

Jamaica's Oblique Seville claimed a stunning victory in the men's 100m, obliterating a line-up featuring Olympic champion Noah Lyles by finishing in 9.86 secs.

Lyles, whose season has been disrupted by injury, finished second in 10.00, ahead of Britain's world bronze medallist Zharnel Hughes (10.02).

World indoor 60m champion Jeremiah Azu was sixth in 10.11, ahead of Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo (10.12) and rising star Louie Hinchliffe (10.21).

Elsewhere, Olympic champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi overhauled world champion Marco Arop in a thrilling finish to the men's 800m.

Kenyan Wanyonyi clocked a meeting record 1:42.00 to edge his Canadian rival, ahead of Britain's Max Burgin who ran a personal best 1:42.36 to finish third and replace Steve Cram as the third fastest British man in history.

He stands behind Sebastian Coe and 2023 world bronze medallist Ben Pattison, who crossed the line in 10th (1:46.08) behind compatriot Ethan Hussey, who ran a personal best 1:44.30.

Molly Caudery placed fifth in the women's pole vault after failing to go clear with three attempts at 4.73m, as New Zealand's Olivia McTaggart won on countback as one of four athletes to clear that height.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson was eighth in the women's long jump with a best leap of 6.48m as she continues to build towards defending her world heptathlon title later this year.

Hahn took victory in the women's race in 12.89 secs, while Skinner edged Thomas Young in 11.01.

Let's dive into the details: Englishman Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, of New Zealand, died in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire

Two riders have died after an 11-bike crash during the British Supersport Championship race at Oulton Park on Monday.

Owen Jenner, 21, and Shane Richardson, 29, were fatally injured in a "major chain reaction" incident on the first lap of the race as the riders exited turn one.

The race, the third of the weekend, was halted on the first lap, with series director Stuart Higgs later calling the incident "severe and catastrophic" as he announced the event was cancelled.

In a statement on Monday night, Motorsport Vision Racing (MSVR), who are responsible for circuit operations at Oulton Park, said another rider, Tom Tunstall, 47, had sustained "significant injuries".

New Zealander Richardson was racing for the Astro-JJR Hippo Suzuki team, while British rider Jenner raced for Rapid Honda.

"Owen Jenner, 21, was initially treated trackside and then taken to the circuit medical centre, where despite further resuscitation treatment he died from a catastrophic head injury," MSVR said.

"Shane Richardson, 29, was initially treated trackside and then taken to the circuit medical centre before being transferred to Royal Stoke University Hospital with severe chest injuries. He died prior to arrival.

"Tom Tunstall, 47, was initially treated on the track and was taken to the circuit medical centre. He was later transferred to Royal Stoke University Hospital with significant back and abdominal injuries."

MSVR and the Motorcycle Racing Control Board added they are "investigating the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the Coroner and Cheshire Constabulary".

Riders Carl Harris, Max Morgan, Cameron Hall, Freddie Barnes and Morgan McLaren-Wood were treated for minor injuries at the circuit medical centre.

Lewis Jones, Corey Tinker and George Edwards were also involved in the accident but did not suffer injury.

A Cheshire Police statement read: "Police are investigating two deaths on behalf of the coroner following a multiple collision at Oulton Park this afternoon.

"Emergency services were called to the scene following the collision which resulted in two riders being fatally injured and another with serious injuries."

The Oulton Park event marked the beginning of the 2025 British Superbikes season, with a further seven rounds set to take place across the UK before three 'showdown' events.

Race one of the meeting took place on Sunday with Bradley Ray claiming victory, before Leon Haslam secured his first win since 2018 in Monday's sprint.

The Supersport Championship is a support class to the main British Superbike series.

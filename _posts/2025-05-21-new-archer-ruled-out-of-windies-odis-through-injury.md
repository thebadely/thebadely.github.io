Let's dive into the details: Jofra Archer has taken 54 wickets in 31 one-day internationals

Seamer Jofra Archer has been ruled out of England's one-day international series against West Indies with a right thumb injury.

Archer will miss the series, which starts on 29 May, having sustained the injury while with Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. 

England said he will "reassessed over the next fortnight to determine when he may return to action". 

The 30-year-old had been left out of the squad for the following three-match T20 series in order to play for England Lions against India A.

Those four-day matches take place from 30 May and 6 June so Archer is set to miss at least the first of those games, which would have been his first red-ball cricket in four years. 

He has been hampered with back and elbow injuries since he last played Test cricket for England in February 2021. 

Speaking to Sky Sports, managing director of England men's cricket Rob Key said: "It is a couple of weeks - he's not going to be far off bowling. 

"We wanted to get four-day bowling in him. He'll probably miss the Lions game we had him down to play but then he'll probably play Championship cricket for Sussex. 

"We'll get some red-ball bowling into him and then he'll be ready - we thought around the second Test [against India] but it may be the third Test now. We'll wait and see but it is nothing too serious."

Lancashire's left-arm seamer Luke Wood has replaced Archer in the ODI squad, having already been part of the T20 group.

Wood has played two ODIs but is yet to take a wicket. The 29-year-old has claimed eight wickets in five T20s. 

The one-day series against West Indies is significant as Harry Brook's first as England's new white-ball captain.

It could also have long-term implications around England's qualification for the 2027 World Cup. 

The top eight teams in the world rankings as of March 2027 will advance directly. England and the West Indies are currently eighth and ninth respectively.

Given everything he has been through, any news of an injury to Jofra Archer is a concern. Mercifully, after years being tormented by back and elbow problems, this is 'only' damage to his thumb.

However, Archer has followed a meticulously laid plan for a potential return to Test cricket. Anything to disrupt that will have consequences.

In this instance, Archer would probably have played two of three one-dayers against West Indies, then made his red-ball return for the Lions against India A.

Even if Archer's thumb heals in time for the Lions game, it is not as simple as throwing him in. After any period on the sidelines, a fast bowler has to gradually rebuild their workload to ensure they are match-ready. Archer will have to go through the same process.

An absolute best-case scenario may have been for Archer to be fit to return to Test cricket in the second match of the series against India. That could now well be pushed back, possibly with some Championship cricket for Sussex used as preparation.

The idea of Archer playing Test cricket again has been fanciful for so long. Now the reality is growing. England will be ultra-cautious not to jeopardise it.

Here’s what you need to know: If you're the kind of FPL manager who likes to take the odd risk, then this week represents a chance.

Erling Haaland's Manchester City host Liverpool, a team he has scored just once against in the league and never beaten.

The Norwegian has been a permanent captain choice, with another two goals last week proving why, but this is surely a game to back against him.

And Chelsea at home against bottom club, and managerless, Wolves seems like the best place to look for an alternative captain.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Don't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert Holly Shand, live on the BBC Sport website at 15:30 BST on Friday, 7 November.

Every striker scored - Jean-Philippe Mateta (9 points), Danny Welbeck (6), captain Haaland (26) - and Arsenal's double defence again came up trumps.

A very tidy 76 points all out.

Alphonse Areola, West Ham, keeper, Â£4.3m - Burnley (h)

This team needs a couple of budget options and Frenchman Areola is a decent choice in net.

Nuno Espirito Santo got his first home win as Hammers boss last week and his plan was always to fix the defence first, so you have to hope they keep it tight against Burnley.

Gabriel, Â£6.6m, and Jurrien Timber, Â£6.1m, both Arsenal - Sunderland (a)

We don't need to say much here really. The Gunners kept their eighth straight clean sheet in the Champions League on Tuesday. A ninth would be an outright club record.

If you can only afford one from their defence, go for Gabriel, who seems on for an assist or a goal from a corner in every match.

The main question is whether it is worth tripling up on Arsenal's defence - our expert Holly Shand will debate that point in Friday's Talking Point article.

Reece James, Chelsea, Â£5.5m - Wolves (h)

James is emerging as an interesting defensive option - especially as Enzo Maresca is using him often as a midfielder.

This game against woeful Wolves is a home banker and you don't need to be a stats person to know James likes an assist and is partial to a long-range goal.

But here's a stat anyway - James has started his past six games and in that time no other defender has created more than his nine chances. 

Brentford's Michael Kayode (11) has, but I think Opta is counting long throws among that number.

James Tarkowski, Everton, Â£5.5m - Fulham (h)

Tarkowski has defensive contribution points (defcon) in seven of 10 games this season, and was fairly close in the other three.

This should be a tight competitive game, conducive to defcon, and Fulham have only scored four on the road this season, earning one point in five games.

Morgan Gibbs-White had 18 FPL returns last season - he only has two after 10 games so far this term

Enzo Fernandez, Chelsea, Â£6.7m - Wolves (h)

This week's team has a Chelsea triple-up and Fernandez wins the midfield spot.

As tempting as it is to pick Moises Caicedo, who is the third top-scoring midfielder in the game, I think Fernandez has more obvious routes to points this week.

Caicedo has three goals from an expected goals (xG) of just 0.6 this season - that can't carry on. And he's less likely to get defensive contribution points in a game like this, with Chelsea set to dominate.

Fernandez, meanwhile, has the same amount of goals from an xG of 4.25. No other midfielder has a higher xG - Mohamed Salah is at 3.28 for example.

Morgan Gibbs-White, Nottingham Forest, Â£7.3m - Leeds (h)

Leeds are a team to target - on the road. They let in three at Brighton last week and that's now 12 of their 17 goals conceded away from Elland Road.

Forest sparked into life, in the second half at least, to draw 2-2 with Manchester United and Gibbs-White is their key midfielder when on form.

He's taken twice as many shots (22) than any of his midfield team-mates and last week's goal was his first of the season despite an xG of 1.91.

Back him to produce again as Sean Dyche's Forest continue to improve.

Eberechi Eze, Arsenal, Â£7.6m - Sunderland (a)

Rolling the dice with Eze again over team-mates Declan Rice (Â£6.8m) and Bukayo Saka (Â£10.1m).

Rice scored last week and is flying with 68 points this season, but the England midfielder's two goals this term have come from three shots on target.

Eze is at the other end of that spectrum, leading Arsenal midfielders in almost every attacking statistic - and that's what I want to see in FPL.

Erling Haaland, Manchester City, Â£14.8m - Liverpool (h)

Haaland is in, but he's not captain this week!

You can't imagine Liverpool's defence - on the evidence so far this season - will keep City out, but this does have the potential to still be a cagey game.

Haaland might be kept to just one goal or even a blank, so I'm looking for a more explosive option.

Joao Pedro (captain), Chelsea, Â£7.4m - Wolves (h)

The Brazilian was really impressive last week against Spurs. He had five shots, five in the box, scored and his xG was 1.86!

That's encouraging given he barely had a shot between weeks five and nine.

Sometimes in FPL you just have to play what's in front of you and for Chelsea it is this managerless Wolves team that is leaking goals aplenty.

They let in four at home to Chelsea in the EFL Cup and have conceded eight in their past three league games.

Jean-Philippe Mateta, Crystal Palace, Â£7.9m - Brighton (h)

He delivered last week and should do again.

The Frenchman is in form, Palace are in form, Brighton have conceded two goals per game away from home.

Simple choice.

Dean Henderson, Crystal Palace, keeper, Â£5m - Brighton (h)

Casemiro, Manchester United, midfielder, Â£5.5m - Tottenham (a)

Neco Williams, Nottingham Forest, defender, Â£4.7m - Leeds (h)

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Everton, midfielder, Â£4.9m - Fulham (h)

Team total cost: Â£99.8m

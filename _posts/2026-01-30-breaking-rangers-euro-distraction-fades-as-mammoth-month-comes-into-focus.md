According to new developments, Rangers' 3-1 defeat in Porto summed up their European exertions this season.

Starting brightly, with some success - see wins over Panathinaikos and Viktoria Plzen.

A quick collapse - see the 6-0 humiliation by Club Brugge in their Champions League play-off second leg.

Then a disappointing second half - see an underwhelming Europa League campaign.

Just one win in the league phase this season - coming last week against Ludogorets - and it all came far too late. By that point, they were effectively out already.

Now attention turns to the league to see if Danny Rohl's domestically resurgent Rangers can rescue a season which began in such tumultuous circumstances.

If they are to do so, the next two-and-a-half weeks are vital.

Rangers end European campaign with Porto defeat

"I'm now fully focused on the league," Rohl told the media just a few minutes after the final ball had been kicked in Portugal.

"We have a mission and for this, we have all our energy now."

Perhaps it will end up being a blessing for the Rangers head coach. He is on a fantastic run domestically - winning his last seven - and the lack of European distraction might help them sharpen that focus.

Three of the next four games will truly test their credentials. First up, it's Hibs at Easter Road on Sunday afternoon (14:00 GMT).

After games against dwindling Kilmarnock and Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup it's Motherwell at Fir Park on 11 February (20:00). 

Four days later, they welcome Hearts to Ibrox - who have beaten them twice already this season. Three of the top five, two away from home. It's a huge test of their credentials.

"We are now fully focused on 15 match days in the league and it helps us to have two normal weeks," Rohl added. "It's the first time we can really train and can be fresh.

"We did well with the rotation. The next two-and-a-half weeks we have big games ahead and we need everyone. Some players will come back, some trained today.

"We kept one coach in Glasgow with them to be as prepared as possible. On Sunday, we go again with full conviction."

With three signings through the door, Rangers' transfer window has certainly got pass marks so far.

Tochi Chukwuani has been a solid addition in midfield and Andreas Skov Olsen is considered a sizeable coup, given the Danish winger's pedigree.

We're yet to see left-back Tuur Rommens in a Rangers shirt, but his signature has given them much-needed depth at left-back.

Rohl has hinted there is more to come, but where? 

"Rangers could do with a striker, even though they have [Youssef] Chermiti," was the opinion of ex-Rangers striker Billy Dodds.

Bojan Miovski has eight goals this season - three of which came against Annan Athletic - while Chermiti has just four. The lack of firepower has been noted.

But instead, all of the transfer rumours swirling around Ibrox whisper about outgoings. Chermiti, Djeidi Gassama, Danilo - all attacking options, all linked with the exit door.

Perhaps that is why Rohl said, before the game, that he expects "the next three, four days to be a little crazy," and admitted he is looking for an attacking player.

Fans will be glued to their phones and turning their notifications on to find out who the head coach can add for his title charge.

It has been recently reported that Max Ojomoh won his first England cap in a comprehensive win over the United States in July

Bath centre Max Ojomoh has been handed his biggest Test chance yet after England lost Fraser Dingwall to a side strain for Sunday's game against Argentina.

Ojomoh will form an all-new centre partnership with Henry Slade, who came in for the injured Ollie Lawrence when England originally named their team on Wednesday.

Dingwall picked up his injury in last weekend's win over New Zealand and struggled to shake it off in training during the week.

"We told Max this morning," England defence coach Richard Wigglesworth told BBC 5 Live.

"The lads were excited for him, he has been playing brilliantly for Bath and has done for quite a while now, so we are excited to see him in an England shirt.

"He's an excellent attacker in terms of his vision and distribution. He gets a backline and an attack moving. On the defensive side of the ball, he has made big strides - he double defends really well and wants to have an impact.

"He takes everything in his stride so we are confident he will enjoy his first start at Twickenham and do it with a smile on his face."

Ojomoh won his only previous Test cap in July's storm-affected 40-5 win over the United States in Washington.

It had appeared his involvement in this autumn's campaign would be limited to training with the senior side and a start in England A's defeat by an All Blacks XV a fortnight ago.

But the 25-year-old has been thrust into the starting XV, with head coach Steve Borthwick opting for his hard running and soft hands, instead of shifting Elliot Daly in from the wing and rejigging his back three.

Ojomoh is the most natural option at inside centre, although he can also play at 13 and covered fly-half for Bath in the early part of this season.

After making his debut for England in the summer, he was challenged with becoming fitter and working hard in defence to improve his chances of more regular game time in England's midfield.

At club level, he was a key part of the Bath team that won the English title last season under the guidance of attack coach Lee Blackett, who has since taken up the same role with England.

Ojomoh's dad Steve won 12 caps for England as a loose forward, with his final appearance coming in a 64-22 defeat by New Zealand in 1998. He also won five league titles with Bath.

Meanwhile Argentina have opted to keep Ojomoh's Bath team-mate Santiago Carreras among the replacements, after the playmaker was deployed to impressive effect from the bench in last weekend's win over Scotland.

Argentina scored four tries after Carreras replaced starting fly-half Geronimo Prisciantelli shortly after half-time at Murrayfield, storming back from 21 points down to win 33-24.

Pablo Matera and Joaquin Oviedo are formidable back-row reinforcements, with Saracens' Juan Martin Gonzalez and Bristol's Santiago Grondona starting alongside Marcos Kremer.

Newcastle scrum-half Simon Benitez Cruz forms a half-back partnership with Tomas Albornoz, with Harlequins trio Rodrigo Isgro, Pedro Delgado and Guido Petti also in the starting line-up.

Former Leicester hooker Julian Montoya, now with French side Pau, captains the Pumas.

England: Steward; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Ojomoh, Daly; Ford, Spencer; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Opoku-Fordjour, Itoje, Coles, Pepper, Underhill, Earl.

Replacements: Dan, Baxter, Stuart, Ewels, T Curry, Pollock, Mitchell, M Smith.

Argentina: Mallia (vc); Isgro, Moroni, Piccardo, Delguy; Albornoz, Benitez Cruz; Gallo, Montoya (c), Delgado, Petti, Rubiolo, Gonzalez, Kremer, S Grondona

Replacements: Ruiz, Wenger, Rapetti, Molina, Matera (vc), Oviedo, Moyano, S Carreras

It has been recently reported that Paris St-Germain became the 24th team to win the Champions League

Paris St-Germain's players celebrated their Champions League victory in the city on Sunday afternoon, hours after trouble broke out across France.

The Ligue 1 club beat Inter Milan 5-0 in Saturday's final in Munich to claim their first Champions League title.

Luis Enrique's side held an hour-long open-top bus parade through the city, running from the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe.

There was a heavy police presence for the celebrations, following the widespread disorder in France that occurred on Saturday night after the match, when two people died. 

A 17-year-old boy died after being stabbed in the chest in the south-west town of Dax, while a 23-year-old man who was riding a scooter in central Paris was also killed after being hit by a vehicle. 

Paris police prefect Laurent Nunez said 192 people were injured in the overnight clashes, with 491 arrests in Paris alone. 

Flares and fireworks were set off, bus shelters smashed and cars torched, with much of the disorder occurring in the capital.

Twenty-two police officers and seven firefighters were injured, while 264 vehicles were set on fire. 

A car ploughed into PSG fans in Grenoble in south-east France, leaving four people injured.

All those hurt were from the same family, police said. Two were seriously injured.

PSG released a statement condemning "in the strongest possible terms the violence that occurred during the celebrations".

"These isolated acts are contrary to the club's values and in no way represent the vast majority of our supporters, whose exemplary behaviour throughout the season deserves to be commended," the club said. 

Despite the disorder, a decision was made to go ahead with the victory parade on Sunday. 

A cap of 100,000 attendees was put on the event. 

PSG's players made their way to the Elysee Palace after the parade to be greeted by France president Emmanuel Macron.

They will close their celebrations with an event for season-ticket holders at the club's Parc des Princes stadium later on Sunday night.

Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played

Stephen Warnock on Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa

It's been the window of the striking strikers.

Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both refused to train this summer and both penned statements demanding moves elsewhere.

Former Blackburn and Aston Villa striker Chris Sutton called the pair's behaviour "despicable", "disgraceful" and "disrespectful".

But, in a heated debate on BBC Radio 5 Live, Joe Hart said clubs "have stomped all over players" in the past.

In the end, whatever your opinion, it worked. On deadline day Isak secured a record Â£125m move to Liverpool from Newcastle who also signed Wissa from Brentford for Â£55m.

In stark contrast, England defender Marc Guehi, who had kept training and playing for Crystal Palace, saw his dream move to Liverpool collapse having been widely praised for his professionalism.

So, is this the way football is heading? Will we have an increase in players actively trying to force a move? And is it ever defensible?

This month Isak released a statement saying promises had been "broken" by Newcastle and that their "relationship couldn't continue".

Two days before the end of the transfer window, Wissa also released a statement on social media calling on Brentford to "keep their word" and let him leave.

Sutton doesn't believe a pattern has been set, telling BBC Sport: "These are two examples of players downing tools and getting a move, but I can also point to Eberechi Eze who didn't and still got his move [to Arsenal this summer]."  

Similarly, Troy Deeney stressed to BBC Sport none of this is new as players have "always done what they needed to do to get their move" and have been releasing public statements and refusing to train "since the beggining of time".

On BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, The Observer's Football Correspondent Rory Smith said: "Does it set a precedent that Isak behaves not brilliantly and gets a move, that Wissa behaves not brilliantly, gets a move, but, Guehi is really nice, and doesn't get his move?

"It's not great, is it?"

Former England goalkeeper Joe Hart added: "I know it is not nice how Alexander Isak has conducted himself, but trust me if Newcastle wanted it to go the other way they would have stomped all over him. 

"I have seen it so many times in football."

Whatever your view, it worked.

The story of the biggest transfer saga of the summer

Before this summer Isak was "fast becoming a Newcastle legend" according to former Blackburn and Aston Villa striker Sutton.

The Sweden striker, who had three years left on his contract, had scored 27 goals  since joining the club in 2022, helping Newcastle win the Carabao Cup in March, the club's first trophy in 56 years.

But, after his British transfer record move to Liverpool, his reputation in the North East is now in tatters.

On the other hand, Newcastle ended up benefiting from Wissa "downing tools" at Brentford. The DR Congo striker missed all four of his side's games in August before the Newcastle's bid on deadline day was accepted.

Although both got their moves, Sutton believes the two players' behaviour was in the wrong.

"Players sign contracts, people in their everyday lives sign contracts and you adhere to those contracts," he told BBC 5 Live's Monday Night Club.

"It is absolutely despicable what they [Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa] have done. They may well be happy tonight, but it is a disgraceful, disrespectful way to behave."

Likewise, back in August, Alan Shearer told BBC 5 Live: "I get clubs and football players, there is no loyalty, clubs look after themselves and players look after themselves, but there's a way of doing things . 

"The way that Alex [Isak] has done things is not the right way."

'A great example of doing the right things'

There are two sides to this debate.

If Guehi had pushed more for a move to Liverpool, would he have left Selhurst Park?

Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney said on BBC Match of the Day on Saturday: "He deserves a lot of credit because we have seen certain players refuse to play. He deserves great credit for doing the right thing."

Ultimately though, model professional or not, Guehi will return to Palace's training ground after the international break.

Former Premier League striker Troy Deeney added to BBC Sport it was "hypocritical" for clubs to criticise Isak and Wissa's behaviour.

"People say there is no loyalty in football, but no one complains when a team gets rid of a player, do they?" said the ex-Watford captain.

"No one says there is no loyalty when clubs get rid of a manager. But they expect the players to be loyal to the team because the fans love the player.

"From a player's point of view, Isak and Wissa won't care because they have their moves."

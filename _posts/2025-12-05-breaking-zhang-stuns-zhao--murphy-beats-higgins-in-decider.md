According to new developments, Shaun Murphy (right) is aiming to reach his first UK Championship final since 2017

Zhang Anda produced a superb potting display to defeat world champion Zhao Xintong 6-2 and advance to the last eight at the UK Championship.

The 33-year-old, who has now reached three consecutive quarter-finals in York, will face Shaun Murphy.

Englishman Murphy came from 4-1 and 5-3 down to defeat John Higgins 6-5 in a dramatic decider, describing it as "one of the best wins" of his life.

Having lost the opening frame of the all-Chinese meeting, Zhang hit back-to-back centuries as the first four frames were shared.

But Zhao, who was guilty of missing several routine pots, was punished heavily by his compatriot when play resumed after the interval.

Zhang was near faultless among the balls and reeled off their next three frames with breaks of 87, 69 and 73 before rounding off his victory in a nervy eighth frame.

"I played so well, there were three frames where I scored heavily and Xintong did not play well. It was my day," Zhang told BBC Sport.

"In the first session, I made two centuries and it was very good stuff from me. In the fourth frame, I missed some simple shots but I told myself to forget it - I am playing well, I can beat him."

For most of Thursday evening, it looked as though Zhang would be granted his wish of playing his boyhood hero Higgins next.

The Scot, who won the second of his two UK crowns in 2010, registered two breaks of 70 plus a 78 and a 60 on his way to a healthy 4-1 advantage.

During that run, he took the third and fifth frames after errors from the reigning Masters champion, who had looked set to win both.

Yet, several loose pots of his own allowed Murphy back into the contest and the Englishman constructed an 89 - his highest break of the Championship - and a 53 on his way to forcing an 11th frame, which went his way after Higgins missed the yellow to the top right corner.

"It's the old cliche of one ball at a time," said Murphy. 

"Any time you play any of the Class of 92, you need your best and any win has to be celebrated. Particularly from that position, it is one of the best wins of my life."

Meanwhile, three-time UK champion Ding Junhui crafted a superb century break to win 6-5 after being forced into a decider by Scotland's Scott Donaldson. 

Ding will play world number one Judd Trump in the next round, while Barry Hawkins will meet Mark Selby after he completed a 6-0 demolition of Elliot Slessor. 

World number 14 Hawkins, the beaten finalist 12 months ago, was too good for a man just seven places below him in the rankings and compiled breaks of 94, 87 and 73 as he progressed comfortably.

Donaldson, 31, who shocked Stuart Bingham in qualifying and then thrashed Mark Allen on what he admitted was an emotional night following the death of his father Hector in October, struggled to settle early on, with his match paused briefly during the first frame while he was at the table as a spectator fell ill.

When play resumed, Ding took the opener with a half-century and then stretched his advantage with runs of 114 and 76.

Donaldson rallied with breaks of 118, 50 and 69 to take three of the next four frames.

And while Ding took the eighth frame, Donaldson continued to battle, crafting breaks of 81 and 72. 

But in the decider, Ding delivered the coup de grace from a superb long red after his opponent played safe on 22.

"When I saw the chance I just wanted to take it," Ding said.

"He has talent, he is a good player. I don't know what has happened because we have different lives. I just want him to move on because what he showed in the last three frames was top class."

Donaldson added: "The fight was good. That is what these top guys do when the pressure is really on. I probably should have gone for a red when I was on 22. You have to take so many crazy risks to beat these guys, so hindsight maybe. 

"It is a tough game but I am proud of the way I fought."

Even though Zhang had defeated Zhao in their only previous competitive meeting a decade ago, he was still regarded as the outside chance going into this contest.

While both practice at the same Sheffield academy, their careers have run on different paths.

Zhang has slipped out of the top 16 in the world rankings, while Zhao, who announced himself on a global stage by winning the UK title in 2021, has gained "megastar" status since becoming the first player from China to triumph at the Crucible in May. 

It was a feat all the more remarkable given he was one of 10 Chinese players sanctioned in 2023 following an investigation into match-fixing and served a 20-month ban.

"He played really well," said Zhao. 

"We practice every day together, so we know each other well but sometimes today I missed some easy shots that I never miss but it is fine. 

"When he plays well he can beat anyone."

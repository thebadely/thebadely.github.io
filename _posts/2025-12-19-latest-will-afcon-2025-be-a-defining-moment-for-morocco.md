Experts revealed that Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi is facing a fitness battle to lead his country on home soil after sustaining an ankle injury in November

When the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations kicks off on Sunday, hosts Morocco are hoping it leads to the culmination of an ambitious long-term plan to become the continent's leading football nation.

Since last lifting the Afcon trophy in Ethiopia in 1976, the Atlas Lions have rarely come close to repeating the feat. It is a lengthy wait which contrasts sharply with recent achievements elsewhere.

"Every time I put [on] the Moroccan jersey, it's like an amazing feeling," midfielder Sofyan Amrabat told the BBC World Service.

The former Manchester United player was a key part of the Morocco side who reached the semi-finals of the last Fifa World Cup in Qatar - the first African nation to go that deep at the tournament.

"It's difficult to explain. It's something you feel inside in your heart," the 29-year-old said about representing his country.

"I'm really looking forward to this Afcon, especially because it's at home. And of course, we hope it's going to be ours."

For Moroccan football analyst Jalal Bounouar, the expectations are clear.

"Morocco's primary and most immediate goal is to win Afcon," he told BBC Sport Africa.

"Winning the continental title is seen as the final piece of the puzzle."

The semi-final defeat by France at Qatar 2022 was followed by the men's under-23s winning bronze at the Paris 2024 Olympics, while the under-20s are world champions after defeating Argentina in October's final.

Morocco have also won the last three African Nations Championships - an international tournament for players based only in domestic leagues - in which they have participated (2018, 2020 and 2024). This week, that side also clinched victory in the Fifa Arab Cup final against Jordan.

These successes have, unsurprisingly, raised expectations, according to Bounouar.

"Since 1976, we have not been able to win the Africa Cup of Nations, can you imagine?" he said.

"That's the only [senior] title in the history of Moroccan football, so it's high time we went for it."

To get this far, Morocco has invested heavily, especially in football infrastructure, including two of Africa's most advanced facilities - both of which bear King Mohammed's name.

Together, the Mohammed VI Football Academy and Mohammed VI Training Complex host youth and senior national teams - men and women - combining elite training with education, accommodation and sports science.

"This evolution of Moroccan football is not a random achievement," said Bounouar.

"It came through years of strategic planning and a long-term national project supported by the highest levels of Moroccan authorities."

King Mohammed first discussed his plan to use football as a tool for social and economic development in 2008, before opening the academy in 2009 and the $65m (Â£48.5m) training complex in 2019.

"The idea was to give young talents modern facilities, good coaches, good education and a healthy environment," Bounouar added.

This structure has helped to create a steady pipeline for both domestic clubs and the national team, alongside an increasing number of players competing at top European clubs.

Nigerian photojournalist Sulaiman Adebayo, who has visited Morocco many times, agrees that the country's rising football profile is no accident.

"Everything they've done for the past four to five years has been deliberate in terms of building facilities and improving their football," he said.

"They are strategic and intentional - and it shows."

While fans have enjoyed the improved performances of Morocco's national teams, recently the size of the investment has come under greater scrutiny.

This year's so-called Gen Z protests saw the country's younger generation call for "hospitals not stadiums", as Morocco continues to spend big on new facilities before co-hosting the 2030 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal.

"There are differing opinions," Bounouar said.

"The majority of Moroccans view football as an essential national project that provides benefits beyond the field.

"Most of them believe success in football is a great way to unite a diverse population and raise Morocco's profile globally, attracting attention like tourism."

According to statistics from Fifa and the Moroccan FA, participation at grassroots level has increased.

Bounouar believes the sport has become "even more embedded in daily life", with more children playing outside of school - something not limited to boys and men, with increased social acceptance of girls playing football having been an original part of King Mohammed's plan.

This has been helped by the Atlas Lionesses reaching successive Women's Cup of Nations finals on home soil, while captain Ghizlane Chebbak is the new African player of the year.

Morocco head into their home tournament as clear favourites.

Currently on a run of 18 consecutive victories - a world record in international football - stretching back to March 2024, the Atlas Lions have scored 50 goals and conceded just four in 20 months, although the quality of their opposition has to be taken into account.

Like many others, Amrabat expects home advantage to play a role.

"We have amazing stadiums with very good pitches. The weather will be good, it's not very hot at the moment in Morocco," he said.

"With the fans behind us, they can push us a lot. We need this energy to go and to press and to show this intensity."

Alongside Amrabat, Morocco boast the continent's best goalkeeper, Yassine Bounou, Real Madrid playmaker Brahim Diaz and Paris St-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi, who was recently named African player of the year.

Hakimi is the team's captain and the undoubted star - it is his name you see on shirts across Morocco - but there remains a doubt over his participation because of an ankle injury sustained during a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in November.

"We will do everything for him to be 100%," said manager Walid Regragui recently.

"But if he isn't, he will be with us no matter what.

"He's the most important player for us, whether on the pitch or in the locker room."

Morocco begin their campaign against Comoros on Sunday (19:00 GMT).

And while that is the opening game of the tournament, it is far from the start of Morocco's recent football journey.

"Now is our moment," said Amrabat. "I believe we have to do it now, especially at home.

"I dream about this moment. We want to give this [to] the people and make everybody happy."

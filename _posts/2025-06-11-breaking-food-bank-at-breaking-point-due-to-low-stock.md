Experts revealed that A food bank has launched an urgent appeal for donations, after its stock reached the lowest level in years. 

Lincoln Foodbank, which is run by the charity Acts Trust in partnership with The Trussell Trust, said it was concerned about how it would continue to support local people in need if supplies run out. 

Staff said the situation was due to a significant fall in donations, alongside a rise in demand. 

Services manager Carolyn Bradbury said: "The situation is dire. We've got about two weeks worth of food left in the warehouse if no other food comes in. We've never had it this empty before." 

She added: "We are at a point now of having to go out and buy food. We've never had to do that before, but now we are. That is a sign that donations have dropped." 

Lincoln Foodbank said it sends out between 150 and 160 food parcels per week, containing at least three days worth of meals for single people, couples, and families. 

But staff expressed their concern about maintaining this if supplies run any lower. 

Ms Bradbury said: "We do this because we want to help people, and if there's no food we can't. 

"The best way to help is just to give. Give what you can. It doesn't matter how small it is, just put it in a donation tub and we'll get it out there."

The charity is also asking those who want to help to download the BanktheFood app, which keeps track of exactly what products are needed. 

There are also various donation points at supermarkets across Lincoln where dry goods can be dropped off. 

The Trussell Trust, which supports a network of food banks, said it had noticed a similar pattern across the country. 

"Food banks in the Trussell community across the UK are facing challenging times, with some at breaking point, as they seek to continue to serve their communities," a spokesperson said.

"The public are extremely generous with their donations of food and money. However, due to rising costs, these donations don't stretch as far as they once did."

The charity encouraged anyone who needs to use a food bank to get in touch with their local food bank to find out how to access support.

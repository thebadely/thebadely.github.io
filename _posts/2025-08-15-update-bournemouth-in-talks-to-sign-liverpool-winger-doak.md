Let's dive into the details: Ben Doak has played just 10 times for Liverpool

Bournemouth have opened talks to sign Scotland winger Ben Doak from Liverpool.

The Reds want Â£25m for the 19-year-old, who is expected to be left out of their squad for Friday's Premier League season opener against Bournemouth.

Doak has been a target for other Premier League clubs and Portuguese side Porto, but the Cherries are considered the frontrunners to sign him, according to multiple sources involved in the deal.

The forward, who has six caps for Scotland, spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, scoring three times and recording seven assists in 24 matches.

He has played just 10 times for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022.

Bournemouth, who have agreed to sell Dango Ouattara to Brentford for Â£42.5m,  are keen to reduce the price for Doak in negotiations.

It has been a busy summer for the Cherries after losing defenders Illia Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez for a total of about Â£150m.

Manager Andoni Iraola admitted his side are "not where they want to be" before the trip to Anfield but added "important movements" will be made before the transfer window closes on 1 September. 

Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite have joined Bournemouth this summer, with January signing Eli Junior Kroupi also coming into the squad after finishing last season on loan at Lorient.

It has been recently reported that Bradley Brooks last played in the World Championship in 2022

Former world youth champion Bradley Brooks won his maiden PDC ProTour title at the Players Championship 21 in Leicester.

The 25-year-old from Blackburn won the Â£15,000 top prize after beating Chris Dobey and James Wade on his way to a final against former world champion Gerwyn Price.

Brooks secured an early break of throw with a 13-dart leg and went on to win 8-5 to seal a spot in December's World Darts Championship.

"I'm lost for words," he said. "This week I felt so comfortable in my own game and everything clicked, so I'm over the moon.

"I treated the final like I had nothing to lose. I can't put into words how much it means to me.

"I struggled a couple of times this year and I still have that bad game in me, but I think when I do get it right, I can mix it with the best in the room."

Michael Smith, the 2023 world champion, was beaten in the first round which means he will miss the World Matchplay in Blackpool for the first time since 2013.

The 34-year-old needed to make at least the semi-finals to qualify, but lost 6-4 to Frenchman Thibault Tricole.

Tuesday's Players Championship 20 was won by Australian Damon Heta, who beat crowd favourite Stephen Bunting 8-7, and both men will be in Blackpool., external

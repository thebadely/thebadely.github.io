It has been recently reported that Manchester Thunder began the evening tied on points with Loughborough Lightning

Loughborough Lightning kept up the pressure on Netball Super League leaders London Pulse with a 65-53 win against Manchester Thunder on Friday.

Thunder had the better of the early stages, but Lightning fought back to lead 38-27 at half-time.

The hosts scored 27 more points after the break to secure victory and move three points above Thunder, after starting the evening tied on 16 points.

Samantha Wallace-Joseph scored 23 goals for Lightning, while Thunder's Elmere van der Berg led the scoring with 27 goals.

Lightning's Shadine van der Merwe was named player of the match for her performance against her former team.

Reigning champions Lightning began the season with two wins and two defeats, but a fourth straight victory puts them second in the standings, two points behind Pulse having played one game more.

Loughborough Lightning's Shadine van der Merwe speaking to Sky Sports: "I've done my homework. It was important for us as a team to suffocate them, and for then be rewarded. That's exactly what happened, but without the players around me I couldn't have done that.

"With every win we celebrate, but it's such a short turnaround so we have to focus on the next one.

"We've just passed the halfway mark but we've still got so much growth to do. It's exciting what comes ahead."

Manchester Thunder head coach Karen Greig: "I'm not overly happy with the performance, we knew exactly what Loughborough were going to come out and do to us and we played straight into their traps.

"They set some traps where they had their defenders playing in split circle, and we played into their hands numerous times. Not learning in those moments and adapting is not OK.

"We've got to stand up to the physicality of the game.

"We haven't got a 60-minute goal attack at the minute. We're playing with 18 and 19-year-olds out there, we're having to work really hard to keep legs and minds fresh."

Lightning head coach Vic Burgess: "That performance wasn't perfect, but to grind out a performance against a solid team like Thunder - I'm really proud of them, but there's still lots to work on."

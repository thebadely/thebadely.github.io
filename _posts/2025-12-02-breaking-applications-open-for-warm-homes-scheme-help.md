Here’s what you need to know: People who are struggling to pay fuel bills are among those who have been urged to apply for help from a council initiative. 

Staffordshire County Council said its Warm Homes: Local Grant scheme prioritised the "most vulnerable" and would provide free heating and insulation upgrades.

Demand is "expected to be high" for the scheme which aims to support people affected by fuel poverty, living in cold homes, or with health conditions made worse by the cold, the council said.

People can check if they are eligible online for the help which funds work such as smart heating controls and loft and wall insulation. 

"Keeping Staffordshire's residents warm and well through the winter is one of our top public health priorities," said Martin Rogerson, cabinet member for health and care.

He said: "By working closely with our district and borough councils, and local health partners, we are targeting help to the households who will benefit the most."

Mr Rogerson added such support could make a "real and lasting difference".

Rhian Wilkinson was appointed Wales boss on a three-year deal in February 2024 

Rhian Wilkinson was left frustrated despite an improved Wales performance as a 1-1 friendly draw with South Korea saw her side's winless run stretch to 12 matches.

Sophie Ingle gave Wales an early lead in Malaga and Wilkinson's team then created a succession of opportunities to stretch their advantage.

But the lack of a clinical edge cost Wales the chance to register a first victory in almost 12 months as Kim Min-ji headed in a second-half equaliser.

A draw was a decent result for Wales given that South Korea, in 21st, are 11 places above them in Fifa's world rankings.

Wales' display was also a step forward following last month's dispiriting 5-2 defeat by Poland â but Wilkinson rued her team's failure to register a first win in almost 12 months.

"[It was] a much-improved performance, a passionate performance," the Wales head coach said.

"We are [frustrated] and we need to be. We created the chances. When you don't get that second or third goal, they are always in the game.

"But I asked them to set a new standard for themselves, to keep pushing, and I asked them to communicate and to connect, and all of those things they delivered today."

Ingle, Hannah Cain, Mared Griffiths, Carrie Jones and Elise Hughes all had opportunities to stretch Wales' advantage as they controlled the first hour in Spain.

Wilkinson said Wales had done extra work in training on defending dead-ball deliveries, hence there was frustration as South Korea's leveller came from a corner routine.

"I thought we improved a lot on set-pieces but one personâ¦ we make a change and someone doesn't know their mark and they score," she added.

Laura Hughes is with the Wales squad for the first time in Spain 

Wales play their final game of 2025 â and their last before 2027 World Cup qualifying begins in March â when they meet Switzerland in another friendly in Jerez on Tuesday (11:00 GMT).

Wilkinson says there will be "some changes" for a meeting with the Euro 2025 hosts, with Wales hoping Laura Hughes will be eligible to make her debut.

The Melbourne City midfielder, who has been capped once in a friendly by Australia, is training with Wilkinson's squad after committing her international future to Wales.

But she was not involved against South Korea because of a delay in finalising her switch of allegiance.

"Her paperwork got held up," Wilkinson said.

"We worked really hard and waited and delayed to make the call that we would bring Liv Francis into the squad [to replace Hughes].

"She was upset. But I said to her before she even came in that we were going to get all guns blazing to try to get it over the line and unfortunately we missed that deadline. I am hoping [Hughes will be available for Switzerland]."

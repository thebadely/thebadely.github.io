It has been recently reported that The Olympics was last held in Los Angeles in 1984

At least one million tickets for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles will be priced at $28 (Â£20.94).

Organisers confirmed the pricing as they announced that fans will be able to register their interest from next month in attending the Games.

From 14 January, fans can enter a random ticket draw covering all Olympic sports and those who are selected will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April.

The announcement by LA28 organisers comes amid criticism of ticket prices for next year's football World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada.

Group-stage tickets for the 2026 World Cup will be up to three times the prices of those for the previous tournament in Qatar in 2022, while the cheapest ticket for the final will cost Â£3,119.

Every sport at the 2028 Olympic Games will have tickets available at $28, while a third of tickets for the event will be "under $100".

"That's not just lip service to a couple tickets in the corner of some venue, but a meaningful number of tickets," said LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield.

"We're looking at at least a million tickets at $28."

Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at 24 euros (Â£20).

The cheapest ticket for England's opening World Cup match against Croatia next June is priced at Â£198, with Scotland's opener against Haiti costing Â£134.

Fans' group Football Supporters Europe has said it is "astonished" by Fifa's pricing strategy, and called for ticket sales to be "halted immediately".

Fifa told BBC Sport last Friday that it had received five million World Cup ticket requests in 24 hours from fans across more than 200 countries.

Katz-Mayfield called LA28's random draw process "the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged."

"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity," she added.

Registration for tickets for the 2029 Olympics will be open until 18 March and there is no advantage to registering early. 

No purchase or payment is required to sign up for the draw.

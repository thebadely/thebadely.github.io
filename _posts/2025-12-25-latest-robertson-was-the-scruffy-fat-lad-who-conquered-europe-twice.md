Experts revealed that Watch Icons of Football with John Robertson on the BBC iPlayer now

John Robertson, who has died at the age of 72, is one of an elite band of seven Scots to have won the European Cup twice. 

He scored a winner in one of those finals, and did the same against England at Wembley. He netted at a World Cup and won a litany of trophies, both as a player and a coach.

Robertson featured in BBC Scotland's Icons of Football earlier this year and here those who know him best look back on his illustrious career.

'An unbelievable feeling to play for Scotland'

You can imagine what itâs like in Nottingham for John evermore, he is the man that won the European Cup for them the second time.

Nottingham Forestâs success in those five years, which is one of the greatest stories in the history of sport let alone football, is absolutely pivotal because of two people in my opinion, Brian Clough and John Robertson.

They are the men, on and off the pitch, who are connected, almost.

John is the personification of Clough on the pitch, he played the way Clough wanted to play and knew exactly what Clough wanted.

Thereâs no debate, the miracle men [Nottingham Forestâs most successful side] all say our best player was Robertson and they love him for it, thereâs not a hint of jealousy.

Mick Wormald, ex-BBC Nottingham broadcaster and journalist

The undoubted star of the show throughout that period of time for Nottingham Forest was Robertson. This was acknowledged by management, team-mates, supporters and everybody who watched the game.

He never missed a game, he was consistent. He turned out week in, week out and did, usually, something magical.

In 1980, Iâm sorry Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Robertson should have been the European footballer of the year.

The Robertson story, I would suggest, is a story of hope and inspiration to an awful lot of people. After all, Robertson was the scruffy little fat lad who conquered all of Europe twice.

John McGovern, Nottingham Forest team-mate

It was quite easy to see that if you wanted to create something, just get the ball out to Robertson as quickly as possible.

Any striker that came to the club knew that once John got the ball out there, they had to get into the penalty box and try get a yardâs difference between you and a defender because he will hit you a ball that is accurate.

All good players are consistent, obviously, but John was remarkably consistent. This guy may not have looked like George Best but he was as good as him in every way.

In those European Cup finals, without John producing something out of the ordinary, we donât win them. You could always rely upon him in situations like that.

Martin OâNeill, Nottingham Forest team-mate and manager at Celtic

He was a beautiful footballer who could play with both feet, terrific ability.

I keep getting back to this word, fulcrum. He very seldom missed football matches and we needed John to play every single one of those games. Heâs played his part in footballing history, I think.

When you consider the things heâs won in the game, heâs an iconic figure, absolutely.

John coming back to Scotland to see his family was a really big thing for him. Very seldom would he have got home and he hears this opportunity to come home as an assistant manager [at Celtic].

John really enjoyed his role. He was a special partner, no question about that.

People, for want of a better phrase, bought into John, they really did. There was something about him.

The players had enormous respect for John as a player and anyone who was playing in his position would come and ask John for advice. Iâve heard of players now, top quality players in the Premier League, that have said that John was influential in his advice to him.

Sherrie Hewson, actress and Nottingham Forest supporter

It was a very short period of time that took John Robertson from a player into a superstar.

If you watch him, itâs an extraordinary experience. You couldnât stop watching him because of the way he just darted and got out of everyoneâs way. No one could get the ball off of him, then bang, itâs a goal.

John was special and became an icon because he had every attribute a footballer should have. He got guidance from Clough, but John had the talent.

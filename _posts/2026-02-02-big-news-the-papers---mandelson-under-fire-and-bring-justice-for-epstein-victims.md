Let's dive into the details: Lord Mandelson's resignation from the Labour party broke too late for the papers, but the front pages do reflect the added pressure he is coming under after the latest revelations related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

According to the Daily Telegraph, Lord Mandelson is set to be summoned to US Congress to give evidence about his links to Epstein. Sources close to the House Oversight Committee, which the paper says has "spearheaded" the release of the Epstein files, say they are "poised to issue" Lord Mandelson with a demand to testify in Washington DC. The committee cannot compel testimony from foreigners, as the paper notes. 

The i newspaper says Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is also facing calls to give evidence to help "bring justice" for Epstein's victims.

Mountbatten-Windsor is also on the front page of the Times. The paper reports that the Metropolitan Police are facing calls to investigate new allegations that a woman claimed she was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor has not responded to a request for comment but has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.

The i newspaper reports that the over-50s are being encouraged to stay in work for longer for the benefit of the UK economy, as well as their own pension pots. Cabinet Office analysis shows that boosting what's referred to as the "silver economy" could drive innovation and generate employment opportunities.

The Times says ministers are paying hospitals in England £3m a month to remove patients from waiting lists, which the paper says is making it look like the NHS is treating more people than it actually is. It is part of a process known as "validation", getting hospital trusts to review and update lists and removing those who no longer need care. An NHS source has said the practice allows other patients to receive treatment faster.

And many of the papers carry photographs of the bizarre moment when the heavyweight boxer Jarrell Miller lost his hairpiece during a fight at New York's Madison Square Garden over the weekend. The Guardian says he appeared to laugh the incident off even though his "flyaway toupee" stole the show, while the Daily Mail says it was "hair-raising".

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England finished runners-up in Group D with two wins from three matches

WhatsApp group chats, a new 'clicking' celebration and 'a day in the life' of Beth Mead - England are doing all they can to bond as a team off the pitch.

Having booked their spot in the quarter-finals, the defending champions are gearing up for Thursday's match against Sweden (20:00 BST).

The Lionesses overcame a heavyweight group stage, suffering defeat by France but bouncing back to record emphatic victories over the Netherlands and Wales.

It was no surprise then, to see captain Leah Williamson relaxed in front of the media on Tuesday, while forward Chloe Kelly spoke glowingly about the squad's "finishers".

With Sweden up next, can England maintain their momentum with the help of some fun distractions off the pitch?

Substitute Aggie Beever-Jones scored in the 89th minute against Wales 

England enjoyed themselves in their 6-1 win over Wales on Sunday as six players got their names on the scoresheet.

Among them were substitutes Mead and Aggie Beever-Jones and their celebrations caught the eye as they ran over to the bench, ran along the substitutes who were lined up on the touchline and clicked their fingers in the air.

Keira Walsh, who started in midfield and won the player of the match award, was left in the dark as to what it meant - but forward Kelly later had an explanation.

"We have a little group of us in a [WhatsApp] group chat - 'the finishers' as you call it - and [they were] 'positive clicks'," said the Arsenal winger.

"You probably saw we were all clicking, thinking 'what are they doing?' But it was just a positive click. We said: 'If one of us comes on and scores, let's do that'. 

"It's just about sticking together and being at our best when called upon, making sure we're prepared to go on the pitch to do a great job."

Kelly said Walsh would be "kept in the loop" from now on, but the group chat was created by Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier for the substitutes.

England's super-subs made a big impact at Euro 2022 - Kelly scored the winner in the final against Germany, after Ella Toone had lobbed goalkeeper Merle Frohms in the same match. Alessia Russo produced a memorable backheel finish in the semi-final win over Sweden.

"Some of us didn't have the pictures of the click celebration so that's where the group chat came from - to send each other the pictures," added Kelly.

"I was saying to Lotte [Wubben-Moy] that throughout the tournaments that we've been playing in, the group of 'finishers' have been incredible."

It is not the only WhatsApp group chat on the go, as Lucy Bronze revealed last week they still use the one they had at Euro 2022.

Recently retired goalkeeper Mary Earps has been among those to message the squad in Switzerland, as well as former striker Ellen White.

"It's just mostly 'good luck', 'well done' or 'we believe in you'," said Williamson when asked about the messages.

"For them to reinforce their belief in the team and want to be part of it, that speaks volumes of the group.

"That group chat was originally created for the [Euro 2022] celebrations, so every time it pops up, it's not a bad thing. 

"Most group chats we archive or mute - but not that one. We're very tame though. I wish we had more banter - but that's not going to come from me."

The banter was there from Williamson this week, however, as she joked with the media in the build-up to England's quarter-final tie with Sweden, dismissing suggestions that ABBA were better than The Beatles, and stressing that nobody wanted to "kill each other yet" after several weeks together in camp.

Regularly catching up with former team-mate Jill Scott, who is out in Switzerland working as a BBC pundit, is one of the many things Williamson has done to switch off from football during the tournament. 

"We were begging for someone to employ her at the FA [Football Association] when she left just to bring her along," Williamson joked.

Having spent most of Euro 2022 sleeping in between games, the centre-back has also tried to be more sociable this time around. 

She missed out on the 2023 Women's World Cup, where England reached the final, because of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, so does not want to let her experience in Switzerland pass her by.

But taking part in a 'day in the life' of Arsenal team-mate Mead was a step too far for Williamson.

"Keira [Walsh] always says I pick up a new hobby every tournament and never follow through with it," said Williamson. 

"Beth Mead was laughing at me the other day because I did the 'day in the life' of her which meant I didn't go back to my room and I was very sociable.

"By the end of the day, I slept good. I said to her: 'I don't know how you do this every day'. It's crazy to me - I'm not that type of person."

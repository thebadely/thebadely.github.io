Let's dive into the details: Raya replaced Aaron Ramsdale as Arsenal's number one

Arsenal have rewarded goalkeeper David Raya with an improved contract to underline his status as one of Mikel Arteta's key players.

It is understood the Spain international has finalised terms on a deal that sees Raya earn a pay increase on the contract he signed when joining the club permanently in the summer of 2024.

BBC Sport understands the agreement was struck earlier this summer but has not been officially announced by the club.

Raya earned a reported Â£100,000-per-week at the Emirates but his wages have increased following the agreement, though the length of his contract is understood to have stayed the same.

His contract currently expires in 2028 - but sources have indicated there is an option to extend the deal.

In a similar agreement, Leandro Trossard penned terms on an improved deal earlier this summer without extending the length of his contract, that expires in 2027.

Like Raya, Trossard's new deal was not officially confirmed.

Since joining Arsenal from Brentford, initially on loan in the summer of 2023, Raya has established himself as one of English football's top goalkeepers.

He won the Premier League's Golden Gloves award in the 2023/24 campaign and retained the accolade last season â sharing the trophy with Nottingham Forest keeper Mats Sels.

Meanwhile, as BBC Sport revealed last week, Arsenal have opened talks with Jurrien Timber over a new long-term deal while the Gunners are hopeful that Bukayo Saka will renew his contract with his discussions at an advanced stage.

France defender William Saliba also recently signed a new five-year deal with the Gunners, while his centre-back partner Gabriel Magalhaes extended his Arsenal deal until 2029 in June.

Raya has been an invaluable asset for Arsenal.

He has missed only six Premier League games and has played every top-flight minute since March 2024.

Since making his debut in a 1-0 win against Everton at Goodison Park in September 2023, he has kept 33 clean sheets - six more than any other Premier League keeper.

His shot-stopping ability - sometimes seen as a weakness - also stands up to the best. His Premier League save ratio stands at 71%, which is bettered by only three first-choice goalkeepers from the start of the 2023-24 season.

Raya goes the longest of any keeper between conceding, letting in one goal every 114 minutes on average in the league.

Former Manchester City keeper Ederson is second on this list, conceding every 96 minutes, with Liverpool's Alisson third on 84.

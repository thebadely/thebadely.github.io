It has been recently reported that Swiatek has a good record in Madrid

World number two Iga Swiatek made it eight wins in a row at the Madrid Open as she beat Linda Noskova to reach the last 16.

The defending champion and 2023 finalist - who is still chasing her first title of the year - won 6-4 6-2 against her Czech opponent, who famously defeated her at the 2024 Australian Open.

The 23-year-old from Poland had to dig deep to beat teenager Alexandra Eala from the Philippines in the previous round in Spain.

But this time she looked more fluent as she came through in one hour and 17 minutes.

Her next challenge will be a first match against 13th seed Diana Shnaider of Russia, who did not drop a game in her encounter with Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova.

American duo Coco Gauff and Madison Keys also made it through to the last 16 thanks to straight-set wins.

Gauff, the fourth seed, defeated compatriot Ann Li 6-2 6-3 while Australian Open champion Keys, the fifth seed, was a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) winner over Russian 30th seed Anna Kalinskaya.

According to new developments, The Sunday Express is among those leading on what the government has billed as "the biggest overhaul of immigration laws since Brexit". The paper says the changes will make it harder for lawyers to use human rights laws to thwart deportations. 

The Mail on Sunday says migrants could be kicked out of the country if they commit any crime, while the Sun's Sunday edition says ministers want to "drive down" the reliance on foreign workers while getting soaring numbers of unemployed, young Brits into jobs.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper says the new rules are "essential to end the chaos left by the Tories... and to regain control". 

The Sunday Mirror says it will be a "job well done" for Cooper if she can protect the economy as well reduce the number of migrants arriving, but the Mail is sceptical, saying its "hard to believe" that a Blairite home secretary "has suddenly abandoned the open borders principles of the Labour top deck".

The Sunday Times reports that a woman is to lead the secret intelligence service, MI6, for the first time after interviews took place last week. Dame Barbara Woodward, the UK's ambassador to the UN, is reportedly the "runaway favourite" for the role. The paper adds that the other two candidates cannot be named for safety reasons, and that Dame Barbara's critics say she is too sympathetic towards China. The final decision will rest with the prime minister. Downing Street declined to comment.

The Telegraph reveals that a retired special constable was arrested and detained over a social media post warning about the threat of antisemitism in Britain. Julian Foulkes, from Gillingham in Kent, was taken into custody in November 2023. This week, Kent Police admitted his police caution was a mistake and deleted it from his record. A force spokesperson said the caution was "not appropriate in the circumstances".

The Sunday Mirror leads with a story about the Duchess of Sussex, which it says is an exclusive.  It reports that her father, Thomas Markle, is living in a £500-a-month high rise flat in the Philippines. The paper says he is being cared for there by Meghan's half brother. Mr Markle is said to have told friends his move to south east Asia is an attempt to find "peace" and "kinder people".

And finally, the Mail on Sunday reports on a job advert for a cat sitter who is prepared to pamper what could be Britain's most spoiled feline. The ad was posted by a luxury private jet company. Duties include playing the British shorthair classical music every Friday, as well as going to Harrods once a month to pick up new toys. The job has an hourly rate of up to £65 - money that the paper notes would be paid into the successful candidate's "kitty".

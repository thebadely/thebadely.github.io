It has been recently reported that Iraola worked at AEK Larnaca, Mirandes and Rayo Vallecano before guiding Bournemouth to their highest Premier League points tally

Having lost Antoine Semenyo to Manchester City, the focus for Bournemouth is now set to turn to manager Andoni Iraola.

The players' revolving door at the Vitality Stadium has spun a little too frequently for Iraola's liking of late.

But it is the manager's own future that will likely emerge as a dominant narrative as the Cherries head towards the final months of the season.

BBC Sport looks at the issues simmering away at the club.

The Spaniard has cultivated a strong reputation since his arrival from Rayo Vallecano in June 2023.

His current lofty standing is a far cry from the sceptical outcry towards his appointment at the expense of Gary O'Neil, who had successfully kept Bournemouth in the Premier League just weeks before.

Then sporting director Richard Hughes' decision to replace the popular O'Neil with the little known Iraola was a brave call - but the Spaniard has repaid the now Liverpool executive's faith.

They finished 12th in his first season and ninth last year with a club record top-flight points tally of 56.

However, Iraola's current contract expires at the end of the season to raise doubt over his long-term position at the club.

For much of the past year this has been a hot topic on the south coast. Last April Bournemouth owner Bill Foley flew to England to hold talks with Iraola over a new contract. But no news has been forthcoming at any point.

BBC Radio Solent's Jordan Clark has said Iraola would be "assessing all the options", but fans were hoping that he would at least sign a short-term contract later in the season.

However, there are varying degrees of interest from a number of clubs in Iraola heading into the summer.

For instance, sources claim Crystal Palace are among those keeping abreast of Iraola's situation heading into next season as they look to find Oliver Glasner's successor.

There will be those who say Iraola has earned the right to take charge of a traditionally bigger club than Palace.

But with suitable assurances over shaping the squad with his imprint, perhaps Iraola would see value in a move to south London.

Speak to those who have worked with Iraola and they describe a man too astute to simply go after the 'biggest' opportunity that may come his way.

Stability, coupled with a directive to build a team in his mould, are said to be far more important factors for Iraola than prestige.

It is likely that Iraola and his advisers are keeping their ears to the ground for what vacancies could be on the horizon.

Of course, the managerial market is gearing up to be extremely competitive heading into next season.

Xabi Alonso, Enzo Maresca and Ruben Amorim to name just three are currently out of work and available.

Glasner has confirmed he is leaving Palace at the end of the season. Thomas Frank, given his plight at Tottenham, could be available.

Then there are international managers Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann, who could also be out of work after the World Cup.

Indeed, the availability of so many top managers could benefit any plans Bournemouth have of trying to extend Iraola's contract into another season.

But you would imagine Iraola will be asking himself whether he has taken Bournemouth as far as he can before making a decision on his future at the Vitality.

In the past two transfer windows Bournemouth have sold three of Iraola's first-choice back four from last season - Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Milos Kerkez to Liverpool and Illia Zabarnyi to Paris St-Germain.

They have also sold attacking players Semenyo and Dango Ouattara.

The remaining member of last season's defence - Marco Senesi - is set to leave the club at the end of the season when his contract expires, with sources indicating that he has no intention of signing a new one.

Bournemouth's recruitment strategy of buying young and selling big has been hugely successful.

The five aforementioned transfers raised a grand total Â£254m for Bournemouth.

In the summer of window of 2024 they also sold Dominic Solanke to Tottenham for Â£55m.

Teenage striker Junior Eli Kroupi, who has scored seven goals in eight starts since arriving from FC Lorient in the summer in a deal worth about Â£12m, is the latest to be catching attention.

Financially, the model has been a lucrative success for Bournemouth, yet it poses the question as to whether Iraola can fulfil his ambitions from a sporting perspective.

You would imagine it is a question Iraola will be asking himself over the next few weeks as he decides his future.

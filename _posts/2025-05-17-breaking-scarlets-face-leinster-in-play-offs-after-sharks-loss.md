According to new developments, Scarlets won the league title in 2017 

United Rugby Championship: 

Sharks (3) 12

Pen:  Masuku, Fassi 3

Scarlets (3) 3

Drop-goal: Costelow

Scarlets will travel to face Leinster in the United Rugby Championship (URC) play-off quarter-finals following a 12-3 defeat in a tryless encounter against Sharks in Durban.

Aphelele Fassi and Siya Masuku shared four penalties for Sharks while Scarlets responded with a Sam Costelow drop-goal.

A last-gasp penalty from Fassi meant Scarlets' failure to gain a bonus point resulted in Dwayne Peel's side staying eighth in the final URC table.

This means Scarlets will face top side Leinster in Dublin on Saturday, 31 May (15:00 BST).

Sharks' victory mean they have risen to third in the URC table and will host Munster in the play-off quarter-finals, while Glasgow will entertain Stormers.

Results on Friday night ensured Scarlets had sealed their play-off status before they started their final regular game of the season, with qualification for next season's European Champions Cup also achieved.

Scarlets' success was rewarded after consecutive bonus-point wins against Ospreys, Dragons, Leinster and Lions.

What Peel's side did not know before kick-off in Durban was the opposition and destination of their quarter-final opposition, although they knew they faced an away game.

A losing bonus point would have seen Scarlets travel to face second seeds Bulls in Pretoria, but that prospect of a trip to South Africa will now fall to Edinburgh.

Scarlets will be hoping former Wales scrum-half Gareth Davies will be fit against Leinster after he suffered a rib injury in the victory against Lions.

Archie Hughes was given his first league start of the season and was given an early reminder of the level he was facing when his first kick was charged down by South Africa lock and Sharks captain Eben Etzebeth, who was living on the offside line all game.

There was no score in a cagey opening quarter with possession spilled by both sides.

Some of the first-half highlights included a searing break from Scarlets flanker Vaea Fifita, while his fellow back rower Taine Plumtree was a lively influence against a side coached by his father John.

Wales centre Joe Roberts, on his 50th Scarlets appearance, collected possession before releasing Hughes who was chased down by Springboks wing Makazole Mapimpi just short of the line.

Sharks fly-half Masuku finally opened the scoring in the 39th minute with a penalty before Costelow levelled matters with a drop-goal just before half-time. 

Scarlets hooker Marnus van der Merwe, who was named in an upcoming Springboks' alignment camp, was the first of the second-half replacements when he came on for Ryan Elias.

With Masuku forced off the field injured, Fassi took over the kicking duties and slotted over two successful penalties as the defiant Scarlets defence held out the home attack.

Scarlets had chances to score a late try. but could not capitalise on late pressure.

Their play-off destiny was then altered with the final kick of the game with Fassi's successful effort meaning they will travel to Dublin rather than Pretoria.

Sharks head coach John Plumtree: "There was no rugby played here tonight. 

"Defences dominated attack and there was plenty of inaccuracy from both sides so it was just one of those games we had to get over the line somehow.

"We know we need to improve on that, but fair play to the Scarlets, they were just so tough and have improved in all aspects of the game."

Scarlets head coach Dwayne Peel said: "It was brutal. I am super proud of the effort we put in. 

"It was a real scrap and fight with both defences on top and the ball was wet and greasy.

"We have had a good tour of South Africa and we are now looking forward to getting home and having two weeks preparations for the play-offs."

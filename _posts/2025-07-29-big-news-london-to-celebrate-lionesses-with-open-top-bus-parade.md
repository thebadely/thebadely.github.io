Let's dive into the details: The England women's football team will take part in an open-top bus parade in central London on Tuesday after their Euro 2025 victory over Spain.

A procession along The Mall will begin at 12:10 BST before a ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace.

Fans will be able to attend the event for free and the celebrations will be broadcast live across the BBC, ITV and Sky.

On Monday, the Lionesses were greeted by jubilant crowds as they landed back in the UK, before attending a reception at Downing Street hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.

The ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial will be hosted by former England star Alex Scott.

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the Lionesses' homecoming parade would be a chance for fans to "cheer these heroes home" after the team had "done our country proud".

Hundreds of fans holding flags and dressed in England kits waited outside Southend Airport on Monday to catch a glimpse of the triumphant squad.

England defended their European title with a 3-1 penalty shootout victory in the Euro 2025 final in Basel on Sunday.

Chloe Kelly scored the winning spot kick following two saves by goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, helping the squad become the first English team to win a major tournament on foreign soil.

Back home, more than 16 million people saw the match live on TV - the most-watched television moment of the year so far.

"The Lionesses have brought it home again," Rayner said during the No 10 event. "And what a fantastic feeling that is. Champions of Europe again."

England manager Sarina Wiegman also gave a short speech - joking that being at Downing Street was "different from standing next to a pitch".

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who was in Scotland on Monday meeting US President Donald Trump, held a five-minute video call with Wiegman and some of the England squad during the reception.

"It's lovely here," the England coach could be heard telling Sir Keir as she thanked him for supporting the team during the Euros.

The event came hours before ministers announced plans to double the amount of time women's and girls' football teams get allocated at government-funded sports facilities.

The government previously pledged to spend £900m on major UK sporting events and grassroots facilities - including £400m for new and upgraded sports facilities over the next four years.

Ministers say a new taskforce will bring together leaders from across sport and academia with the aim of replicating the progress made in women's football in other sports.

King Charles III also paid tribute to the Lionesses on Monday, saying they had the Royal Family's "warmest appreciation and admiration".

It is understood plans for a reception in the autumn at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle are being explored by officials.

Asked about calls for the team to be recognised with honours, the prime minister's spokesman stressed there was an independent process for nominations.

But he added: "I hope we'll see lots of nominations for this incredible winning team."

Downing Street dismissed calls for an extra bank holiday following the victory, with the spokesman saying: "If we had a bank holiday every time the Lionesses win we'd never go to work."

Royal Mail has, however, announced plans to mark England's win with a special postmark, which will be applied to stamped mail across the UK from Monday to Friday.

It reads: "It's Home. Again. Champions of Europe 2025. England Women's Football Squad."

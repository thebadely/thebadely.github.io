Let's dive into the details: George Turner has not played since joining Kobelco Kobe Steelers in Japan

George Turner has been recalled by Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend for their summer Pacific Tour after a year out while playing in Japan.

But there is no place in the 36-man party to face the Maori All Blacks, Fiji and Samoa for fellow hooker Dave Cherry and scrum half Ali Price, who are both leaving Edinburgh this summer, and experienced lock Jonny Gray.

Glasgow Warriors number eight Jack Dempsey, Edinburgh flanker Luke Crosbie and centre Mosese Tuipulotu all miss out through injury.

Warriors prop Fin Richardson is called up for the first time to a squad minus seven players involved with the British and Irish Lions.

Bath fly-half Finn Russell, who was co-captain for the Six Nations, is one of those absentees, so Glasgow flanker Rory Darge is named as skipper on his own this time.

Uncapped Soyaux Angouleme XV Charente number eight Alex Masibaka and Saracens fly-half Fergus Burke, who were in this season's Six Nations squad without playing, are included.

Saracens forward Andy Onyeama-Christie and Glasgow lock Max Williamson return after missing the Six Nations through injury.

Glasgow forward Matt Fagerson has been selected as he continues his recovery from injury.

Turner has not played for Scotland since leaving Warriors for Kobelco Kobe Steelers in Japan, but the 32-year-old could now add to his 45 caps after signing for Harlequins for next season.

Townsend said: "He's fully fit - I think he had a few niggles, but he's coming back to the UK to play club rugby, so he'll be available for us for every Test match next year, which hadn't been the case when he's in Japan."

Cherry, who was Scotland's first-choice hooker for the Six Nations, is leaving Edinburgh to join Vannes, while Price is joining French rivals Montpellier.

Townsend explained that Cherry had picked up an injury at the end of the season with Edinburgh, was in the process of joining a new club and, with the player now 34, he had to have an eye on the long-term future in his position.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: St James' Park has hosted Magic Weekend eight times since 2015

RL Commercial managing director Rhodri Jones is "quietly confident" the Magic Weekend will return to Newcastle next season.

More than 64,000 tickets were sold over the two days as St James' Park hosted all six matches of Super League round 10.

The event returned to Newcastle United's stadium for the eighth time after last year's edition switched to Leeds United's Elland Road home.

"They were disappointed we weren't here last year so they are delighted we're here and they want us to come back as well," Jones told BBC Sport.

"We are in advanced talks with Newcastle United Football Club and there'll be an element of time where we just have to wait for a couple of things to drop in, but we're quietly confident we'll be back here next year."

Jones said this year's event had attracted its highest crowds since Covid and drawn a record Sunday attendance.

He also estimated that 8-10,000 of tickets sold went to addresses within the Newcastle postcode area, creating a "growth opportunity" for the sport.

"We're taking it to a different destination, we're attracting those 8-10,000 from a different locality that perhaps don't go to regular Super League fixtures, so there's a lot to like about Magic Weekend," he added.

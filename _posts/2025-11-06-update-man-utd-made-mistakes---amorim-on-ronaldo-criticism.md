'We know we made a lot of mistakes in the past'

Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has admitted the club has made mistakes - but stressed they must look to the future rather than dwell on the past.

In an extensive interview with Piers Morgan earlier this week, legendary former United star Cristiano Ronaldo said that while he thought his fellow Portuguese was doing a good job, Amorim could not work "miracles".

Al-Nassr striker Ronaldo, a former international team-mate of Amorim, argued that while some of United's players were good, others did not have the "mind" of a player for the club.

Asked to respond to Ronaldo's comments as he spoke to the media before his side's trip to Tottenham on Saturday (12:30 GMT), Amorim did not address them directly but stressed the need to look forward.

"He [Ronaldo] knows he has a huge impact with everything he says," Amorim said.

"We know as a club we made a lot of mistakes in the past. We are trying to change that.

"Let's not focus on what happened [in the past].

"We are changing a lot of things; the structure, the way we want the players to behave. We are improving. Let's forget a little bit the past."

Ruben Amorim is nine days older than Cristiano Ronaldo

Ronaldo, who left United to join Real Madrid in 2009, rejoined the Old Trafford club from Juventus in August 2021. 

However, he had his contract terminated in November 2022 after he criticised the club and said he had "no respect" for then manager Erik ten Hag in a previous interview with Morgan. 

In his latest interview with the broadcaster, the 40-year-old said: "I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world and a club that I still have in my heart.

"They don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present and future, because the potential of the club is amazing.

"They are not on a good path. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion... He [manager Ruben Amorim] is doing his best. What are you going to do? Miracles are impossible."

Can Man Utd shore up defence without losing their cutting edge?

Who do fans think is the key player in each Premier League team?

Amorim, who took charge of United in November 2024, led the club to last season's Europa League final but they missed out on the trophy - and qualification for this season's Champions League - as they lost to Tottenham.

They finished 15th in Premier League, their worst performance since the 1973-74 campaign in which they were relegated from the top flight.

They spent more than Â£200m in the summer but started this season slowly - including being knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town.

Amorim appeared to be under pressure, but United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the Portuguese needed three years to prove he is a "great" coach.

In an interview in March, Ratcliffe said the club had "not performed at the level that has been expected" since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson as manager at the end of the 2012-2013 season, adding that some United players were "not good enough" and some were "overpaid".

Recently, United have shown an improvement in form, winning three of their past four league games - including a victory at Liverpool - and are eighth in the table.

France wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey was named player of the tournament after becoming the top try-scorer in a single Six Nations campaign with eight tries

France won the 2025 Six Nations thanks to a bonus-point win over Scotland in the final match of the Championship.

France, England and defending champions Ireland all only lost one game, but Fabien Galthie's side picked up a bonus point in every game including a losing bonus in their 26-25 defeat by England at Allianz Stadium.

England finished second - their best position since the last time they won the tournament in 2020.

Ireland, who were led by interim head coach Simon Easterby while Andy Farrell was away with the British and Irish Lions, came third, but had the consolation of winning the Triple Crown after beating England, Scotland and Wales.

Scotland beat Italy and Wales to finish fourth for the second year running.

Italy beat Wales in round two and picked up a losing bonus point against Ireland to finish in fifth place.

Wales secured three bonus points but suffered five straight defeats for the second successive year as they retained the Wooden Spoon.

Teams earn four points for a win and two for a draw.

Teams earn one bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and for losing by seven points or fewer. 

A team that completes a Grand Slam by beating all five other nations is awarded three extra bonus points to guarantee them the title.

How does the Six Nations points system work?

What is the 'Triple Crown' and 'Wooden Spoon'?

England's Allianz Stadium in Twickenham, London has the biggest capacity with 82,000 seats

France will play Ireland and England at the 81,338-capacity Stade de France in Paris and Italy at the 50,186-capacity Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille

Wales' Principality Stadium in Cardiff can seat 73,931 fans

Italy's Stadio Olimpico in Rome has room for 70,364 spectators

Scotland's home ground of Murrayfield in Edinburgh has a capacity of 67,144

Ireland's Aviva Stadium in Dublin can welcome 51,700 spectators

Six Nations Pod Guide: Twickenham

France's triumph in 2025 was their seventh since the championship became the Six Nations.

Their victory drew them level with England for the most titles won since Italy joined the tournament in 2000.

Wales and Ireland have both won six Six Nations, while Scotland and Italy have never lifted the trophy.

Wales and France lead the way when it comes to Grand Slams with four each, Ireland have three and England two.

Ireland have won the Triple Crown eight times, with England and Wales on five each. Scotland have yet to lift the Triple Crown trophy.

The trend of looking back 10 years has brought back some happy memories for England players of that generation.

The 2016 Six Nations was the last time that England secured a Grand Slam.

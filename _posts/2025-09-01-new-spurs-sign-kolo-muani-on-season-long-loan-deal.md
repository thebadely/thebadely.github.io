According to new developments, Randal Kolo Muani played for Juventus at the 2025 Club World Cup

Tottenham Hotspur have signed Paris St-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani on a season-long loan deal.

The France international, 26, moves on deadline day after agreeing personal terms, with the deal only subject to international clearance and being granted a work permit.

Kolo Muani will wear the number 39 shirt at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

He had been linked with Premier League clubs for several months, with interest from Spurs, Manchester United, Chelsea and West Ham.

The former Nantes and Eintracht Frankfurt forward spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, scoring eight goals in 16 Serie A games.

He joined PSG in September 2023 and has won two Ligue 1 titles.

Kolo Muani also has 31 senior caps for France, scoring in the 2022 World Cup semi-final victory over Morocco and playing in the final defeat by Argentina.

"I'm really happy and very proud to be at such a great club," Kolo Muani told the club website, external. "I can't wait to meet my team-mates, all the fans and to get out on the pitch.

"I know what the coach expects from me. I will fight hard for the shirt, the club and the fans. I will give everything for this team."

Spurs boss Thomas Frank added: "Randal is a quality player who has proven himself over a number of years, playing for big teams in the Champions League and also with good experience for the France national team.

"He's a good age, in the prime of his career, has good qualities that will suit both us and the Premier League, and gives us a different option in the final third being able to play out wide and through the middle.

"We are all excited for what Randal can add to the squad, and I'm looking forward to working with him."

Kolo Muani is Tottenham's fourth senior signing of the summer, following Mohammed Kudus, Joao Palhinha and Xavi Simons.

Along with wingers Kudus and Simons, centre-forward Kolo Muani could help form a new look strikeforce for Spurs as they prepare for a Champions League return.

The signings come at the end of a window which has been difficult at times for Tottenham, with failed moves for targets including Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze - who joined Arsenal instead.

Kolo Muani's arrival comes amid fears about the severity of striker Dominic Solanke's ankle injury.

Speaking after Spurs' 1-0 home league defeat by Bournemouth on Saturday, Frank said he was hopeful Solanke would be back after the international break.

He also warned against a potential imbalance in the squad if Spurs brought in another attacker.

"To have the three strikers in the squad can also cause a problem as you can only play one at a time," Frank said. 

"It's a fine balance. I'm not saying we will never go for another striker at another time, but I'm happy with Solanke and Richarlison."

However, the Englishman's absence at the weekend meant Spurs had no specialist centre-forward on the bench - and they have now moved to reinforce their attack.

Kolo Muani is perhaps best known for a chance he missed - the 120th-minute effort for France against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final which was so brilliantly saved by the leg of Emiliano Martinez.

However, the fact he was in that position indicates what sort of player he is and why Spurs have signed him on loan.

Kolo Muani is two-footed, has a knack of finding space in the area - and standing 6ft 1in, is good in the air.

He has scored regularly at most places he has played - 10 goals in 22 for Juventus, and 26 in 50 for Frankfurt. He only netted 11 in 54 for PSG, but many of those appearances were as a substitute.

Kolo Muani provides a silkier alternative to the more physical style of Richarlison, who started Tottenham's defeat by Bournemouth as the central striker.

And the Frenchman is also capable of playing anywhere across the front-line, ensuring valuable depth for Spurs as they aim to compete at home and in Europe.

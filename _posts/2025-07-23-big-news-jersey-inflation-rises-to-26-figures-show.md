Let's dive into the details: Inflation in Jersey has increased in the past three months, new figures have revealed.

The Retail Prices Index (RPI) for June 2025 said the annual figure was 2.6%, compared to the previous three months when it stood at 2.3%.

The RPI, which measures changes in the price of goods and services, found leisure goods and services - including sports and off-island holidays - had made the largest contribution to the annual rate.

Statistics Jersey said a decrease in housing, petrol and diesel prices helped offset the overall rising costs.

In December, the figure was 2.5% - a steep decrease since the historically high level of 12.7% in early 2023.

It has been recently reported that Joseph Parker has 36 wins from his 40 professional fights

Former world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker is facing a possible ban from boxing after testing positive for cocaine.

The 33-year-old New Zealander failed a drugs test on the day of his fight with Fabio Wardley on 26 October. 

He was tested by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) on 25 October.

Sources have confirmed to BBC Sport Parker tested positive for the recreational drug and not performance enhancing drugs.

His promoter, Queensberry Promotions said:, external "Joseph Parker returned an adverse finding in relation to his bout with Fabio Wardley.

"While the matter is investigated further, no additional comment will be made."

Parker could receive a two-year ban but could also be suspended for as little as three months depending on circumstances. 

Any ban would be handed down by UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC).

Ukad, however, did not administer this test and will need to conduct its own investigation.

The BBC has contacted Vada and the BBBC for comment.

Parker's UK manager Spencer Brown told Reuters: "We are in total shock at the findings.

"It is very early days and we will get to the bottom of it all."

Boxer Liam Cameron was given a four-year ban in 2019 for testing positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolic acid of cocaine, but rules have changed since then with rugby league player Adam Rusling getting a three-month ban in 2024 for testing positive for cocaine and MDMA.

Parker was hoping to put himself in position for a fight against undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk, but was upset by Briton Wardley at the O2 Arena.

Parker was heavyweight champion between 2016 and 2018, with his reign ended by Britain's Anthony Joshua in Cardiff.

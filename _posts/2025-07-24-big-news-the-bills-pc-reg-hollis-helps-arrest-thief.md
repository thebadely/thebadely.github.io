It has been recently reported that A former star of ITV's The Bill has helped real-life officers arrest a suspected shoplifter.

Jeff Stewart, who played PC Reg Hollis for 24 years, came to the aid of police in Ocean Way, Southampton, on Wednesday.

The fleeing suspect fell off a bicycle before being handcuffed and Stewart, who lives locally, sat on his legs.

In video of the arrest released by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary, officers thanked the actor before asking for a group photo. 

The star replied: "No, sure, man. Well, I was in The Bill for 24 years, in the TV show. Yeah, I played Reg."

The body-worn police video showed officers running across a car park in pursuit of the suspect who was wheeling a bicycle.

He fell off as he started to pedal away and was wrestled to the ground.

The actor, wearing shorts and sunglasses, was on the scene seconds later, helping the two officers.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: "In policing you should always expect the unexpected, but this really wasn't on The Bill for this week.‚Äù

Describing Stewart as a "local TV legend" the spokesman added: "Long since retired from Sun Hill station - but he's still got it."

The actor left the long-running police drama in 2008. 

He went on to appear in a music video for indie pop band Miike Snow.

Stewart also won a prize at the Manhattan Film Festival in New York in 2011 for a role in low-budget film Under Jakob's Ladder.

Police said the thief, 29-year-old Mohamed Diallo, of Anglesea Road, admitted stealing alcohol and food in five separate incidents in Southampton.

He was released on bail and will be sentenced by Southampton magistrates in August.

Referees' chief Howard Webb on new Premier League rules

The scope of the video assistant referee in the Premier League might be expanded in the future to include decisions on yellow cards and the awarding of corners, says Howard Webb.

Referees' chief Webb says the game's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), is reviewing how VAR operates and he is "open to discussions" about other uses.

VAR, which has operated in the Premier League since the 2019-20 season, can currently only intervene in what are perceived as match-changing decisions - goals, straight red cards, penalties and mistaken identity.

"There will definitely be discussions around possible extensions," Webb told BBC Sport.  

"Some believe we should use VAR more extensively for certain situations, but there are others who feel that shouldn't happen.

"We try to align VAR delivery with the expectations of those involved in the English game, based on consultation with fans, coaches and players. The message we get is 'less is more' with VAR, and we've done pretty well in aligning our delivery with that expectation.

"VAR has been in place for seven years and has pretty much stayed the same. If the game, or the people involved, tell us that greater use would be better for the game, then of course I'd be open - but we need to think carefully about the consequences, the ripple effects.

"If you are talking about yellow cards that are delivered incorrectly, which could be impactful on the game, then you also have to think about wrongly not-issued yellow cards.

"I understand the impact of a wrongly awarded corner that's clearly wrong - easy to see on video - and the impact of a wrongly issued yellow card. But equally there's also a feeling that VAR already exists to rectify clear errors in big situations, so we'll have those discussions and make sure to consult with the English game as well."

The 2025-26 Premier League season starts on Friday and several new rules are being introduced. 

Along with in-stadium announcements on VAR decisions, and only captains being allowed to speak to the referee over big decisions, a new law means a goalkeeper holding the ball for more than eight seconds will be punished with a corner for the opposition.

"It's quite a radical change, really, but the basic idea is to get the ball back into play more quickly," said Webb.

"It's meant to be preventative, not punitive. Like in other sports - if you play tennis at Wimbledon, you have to serve within a certain amount of seconds."

Webb believes abuse of referees at all levels of the game is worse than it has ever been and says more support is being provided to support officials.

In January, police launched an investigation after Michael Oliver received death threats online. In September, Anthony Taylor was temporarily stood down from officiating after being abused on social media.

Taylor and his family were confronted by angry Roma fans in Budapest airport after the Italian side lost to Sevilla in the 2023 Europa League final, with video of the incident posted on social media.

"People have a bigger platform than ever to voice opinions, but some of how that opinion is voiced is unacceptable," said Webb.

"We saw examples with our officials last season. It happens with players and other participants in the game as well. It's a little bit of a reflection of society today - people express strong opinions, which is normal, and the game naturally creates split opinions in the grey zone.

"But disagreement with an outcome doesn't give a license to abuse officials on certain platforms, including threats to the safety of officials and their families. That is wholly unacceptable.

"We provide good support for officials, including psychological support, mental health and well-being. Support extends to their families, too."

Webb says the introduction of VAR has increased scrutiny on officials' decision-making and can create perceptions of conspiracy of bias, though he says such perceptions are "wholly unjustifiable".

He said: "Previously, referees made judgments in the moment based on what they saw. Now, VAR reviews decisions with more time and different angles. But that doesn't change the fact that some decisions remain grey.

"If you think a penalty decision is wrong, you expect VAR to get involved. But if it's 50/50, half will think the original decision was right, and if VAR overturns it, those people will be disappointed.

"The skill for us is recognising when a situation is truly grey and conversely when there is a truly clear one. But don't expect to agree with the final outcome every time."

David Coote was sacked by the Premier League in December 2024

Webb says it would be "tough" for David Coote to return to top-level refereeing after he was sacked for misconduct last year.

Coote was dismissed by referees' body Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) in December 2024 after a video emerged online of him making derogatory remarks about Liverpool and then manager Jurgen Klopp.

On Tuesday, the Football Association (FA) issued an eight-week suspension and ordered Coote to have mandatory face-to-face education about the incident.

"Under the circumstances, it's difficult [for him to return]," said Webb. "We stay in contact and care about him, but it would be tough."

The 42-year-old has also been banned by Uefa for a separate video showing him sniffing a white powder when he was on duty at Euro 2024, which is organised by European football's governing body.

"This was one individual who made poor choices outside the game," said Webb. "Our job was to assess the impact his role as an official had on those choices, given the stress officials face.

"It was an opportunity to reflect on how we support officials and to address any gaps in external expertise, which we've done recently with new appointments. It doesn't reflect on the wider officiating culture or other officials' work.

"David was a former colleague we cared about and wish well for the future, but his choices were individual to him and don't reflect the wider group."

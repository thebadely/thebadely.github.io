It has been recently reported that Maro Itoje and Tadhg Beirne already have eight Lions caps between them

British and Irish Lions v Argentina

Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Friday, 20 June Kick-off: 20:00 BST

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app, and updates on BBC Radio 5 Live

After British and Irish Lions head coach Andy Farrell described Friday's curtain-raiser against Argentina as a "full-blown Test match" and said he wanted the performance of his side to leave those squad members not involved "twitching" with jealousy, tour skipper Maro Itoje was singing from the same hymn sheet. 

When the England second row, who will lead the Lions for the first time, was asked what he himself wanted to see, he replied a unit that is as "cohesive as possible". 

While still a month from the first Test against Australia in Brisbane on 19 July, the squad's media outings this week have made clear that the battle for spots in the biggest games has already begun.

To that end, Itoje and his second row partner Tadhg Beirne on Friday have a real opportunity to lay down a marker to pack down alongside one another when the tour reaches boiling point.

With those who joined up late thanks to domestic play-off involvement, with the exception of replacement hooker Ronan Kelleher, not selected for this first game, Farrell has named a fresh side with some new combinations.

Of the 23 selected, 14 will be representing the Lions for the first time. 

His second row partnership, however, were both on the tour to South Africa four years ago while Itoje was also a 2017 tourist in New Zealand.

Although Beirne was primarily a blind-side flanker in South Africa, the pair were both on the field for the conclusion of the second and third Tests.

Room-mates on that tour and in the early part of this one, it is clear that a mutual admiration has developed.

"We spent a bit of time together in the last tour and built a good relationship and it's been amazing that we've been able to continue on this tour," said Itoje.

"He's a fantastic player, that's clear for everyone to see. His ball skills, the way he moves the ball and controls it, and he has that level of physicality to his game which is really impressive."

In the years since that tour together to South Africa, Itoje and Beirne have been in frequent opposition, whether with England and Ireland or Saracens and Munster.

Beirne has enjoyed joining forces in one area in particular where the pair are used to going head-to-head.

"We've been bouncing ideas off each other for the line-out and stuff with JD [forwards coach John Dalziel]," he said.

"So far the relationship's been really good and really enjoyable."

As skipper, Itoje is naturally the figurehead of the group but, as a provincial captain himself with Munster, Beirne stands to be one of the experienced players who can share that load through the long trip.

"Probably one of the most impressive things I've seen from Tadhg has been his leadership and how he is about and around the group," added the Saracens player.

"He leads the boys in a very calm but mature way."

If a Lions tour is all about the successful blending of cultures and styles, Beirne similarly appreciates Itoje's manner of leadership even if it is different to his own when leading Munster.

"One thing I'm very impressed by, he speaks incredibly well.

"He doesn't curse. I've noticed [as] someone who, when you do get a bit amped up, you tend to curse a lot. 

"So, yeah, he's very well-spoken and he's led the team really well so far."

Itoje spoke about the "tremendous opportunity" for those involved on Friday to show what sort of team the 2025 British and Irish Lions are going to be.

In tours such as these, though, there will always be an element of vested interests with each opportunity a chance to press for further involvement down the line.

As captain, Itoje stands to be the first name on the team-sheet at this stage but Beirne will know the likes of Ollie Chesum, Scott Cummings and his Ireland team-mates James Ryan and Joe McCarthy will all be fighting for the same jerseys.

"Everyone's going to get their opportunity, with the schedule that we have there's no one not going to be given an opportunity along the way," he said.

"Each opportunity you do get, you seriously need to put your hand up if you want to be one of the lucky people, playing in that 23 come the first Test.

"But I'm lucky enough to be playing this Friday, and I have an opportunity to lay down a marker for myself."

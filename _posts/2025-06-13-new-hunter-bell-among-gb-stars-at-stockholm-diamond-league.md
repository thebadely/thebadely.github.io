It has been recently reported that Georgia Hunter-Bell won 1500m bronze on her Olympic debut at Paris 2024

Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson's return from injury has been delayed but several other British stars are set to compete at the Stockholm Diamond League on Sunday.

Hodgkinson, 23, was preparing to compete for the first time since winning her first global 800m title at Paris 2024 but she has suffered a setback in her recovery from the hamstring injury she sustained in February.

In her absence, Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Georgia Hunter-Bell and Jemma Reekie contest the women's 800m against Kenya's world champion Mary Moraa.

Sprinters Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita come up against Olympic champion Julien Alfred in the 100m, while world indoor champion Amber Anning and Ireland's Rhasidat Adeleke race over 400m in the Swedish capital.

Innes Fitzgerald, Katie Snowden and Hannah Nuttall are in 3,000m action, with hurdler Alastair Chalmers and discus thrower Lawrence Okoye also competing.

Sweden's pole vault world record holder Armand Duplantis, Femke Bol and Karsten Warholm are among those also competing as athletes continue to build towards September's World Championships in Tokyo.

Watch the Stockholm Diamond League action on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app from 17:00-19:00 BST on Sunday.

Hodgkinson won her first global title at Paris 2024

Stops in Paris, Eugene and Monaco follow the Stockholm Diamond League, before the series stops in the UK for a sold-out London Athletics Meet.

Hodgkinson has been named on the entry list at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene on 5 July, alongside main rivals Moraa and American Athing Mu.

She has also been confirmed to compete at the London Diamond League on 19 July, the event where last summer she improved her British record to one minute 54.61 seconds.

London will also play host to the latest chapter in the 1500m rivalry between world champion Josh Kerr and Norwegian rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen.

Olympic and world 100m champion Noah Lyles, world 400m hurdles champion Bol and British pole vaulter Molly Caudery are also on the entry lists.

Before then, five-time Diamond League champion Faith Kipyegon, who will attempt to become the first woman to run a sub-four minute mile in June, contests the 1500m alongside Hunter-Bell in Eugene.

Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo and world 100m champion Sha'Carri Richardson are both also in action in Eugene.

The 16th Diamond League season is under way as athletics' Olympic stars build towards their shot at world glory in 2025.

Athletes compete for points in 32 disciplines in a bid to qualify for the finals in Zurich in August.

That takes place just over a fortnight before the start of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan.

All Diamond League events will be shown on the BBC, which has agreed a deal to broadcast the competition for the next five years.

It is also the first year in which the Diamond League must compete with Michael Johnson's new Grand Slam Track for athletes' attention.

However, there has been only one direct clash between the two competitions - with the Miami Slam on 2-4 May taking place at the same time as the meet in Keqiao, China on 3 May.

The Diamond League has increased its prize money to the highest level in its history, with a total prize pot of $9.24m (Â£6.95m) on offer across the series.

That includes $500,000 (Â£375,000) at each of the 14 series meetings, and $2.2m (Â£1.7m) at the Diamond League final.

The Diamond League final will be held in Zurich for the first time since 2022

Athletes will compete for points at the 14 regular series meetings which started in April and run through to August. 

Points are awarded on a scale from eight for first place to one for eighth place. 

After the 14th meeting in Brussels, the top six ranked athletes in the field events, the top eight in track events from 100m up to 800m, and the top 10 in the distances from 1500m upwards qualify for the final. 

The two-day finals are a winner-takes-all competition to be crowned Diamond League champion in each event.

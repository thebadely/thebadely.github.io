According to new developments, Will Jacks took six wickets on his Test debut against Pakistan in 2022 but has not played since that tour

England Test captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum make new players feel "on top of the world", says all-rounder Will Jacks after receiving a surprise recall for this winter's Ashes in Australia.

Off-spinner Jacks has played only two Tests, in 2022, but returns as cover for Shoaib Bashir ahead of Rehan Ahmed, Liam Dawson and Jack Leach.

"The leadership group make you feel like you can take anyone on," Jacks told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"For someone who comes into the team making your debut, that builds you up quickly and makes you feel like you belong there straight away.

"He (Stokes) leads with his own actions, which makes him really easy to follow. He would never ask you do something he's not willing to do."

Jacks is a regular in England's white-ball team but has taken only five wickets in 74.1 overs in first-class cricket this year.

"Baz (McCullum) called me, had a casual chat then just dropped it in, and it took me completely by surprise - definitely brightened up my morning," Jacks said.

"I'm happy to play whatever role the team needs. That's what I have been doing in the white-ball team.

"It was great to be involved with the Test side and how Stokes led the team. So I am looking forward to being a part of it again."

The opening Test of the five-match Ashes series starts on 21 November in Perth.

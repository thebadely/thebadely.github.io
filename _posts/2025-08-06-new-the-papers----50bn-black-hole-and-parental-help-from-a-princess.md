The Daily Mail and the Telegraph highlight the scale of what is apparently needed: five pence on income tax if Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants to keep afloat by the end of decade and still meet her fiscal rules.

The Times' leader column says the treaty seems unlikely to work, and suggests Sir Keir Starmer focus instead on creating consensus in the EU, for an overhaul of the European Convention on Human Rights.

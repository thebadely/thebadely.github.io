Let's dive into the details: Plans to redevelop Leeds United's Elland Road home have been approved, with capacity set to increase by more than 15,000.

The expansion will see the ground become the seventh largest English football stadium, as it jumps from 37,645 seats to about 53,000.

Leeds City Council's planning panel approved the club's application on Thursday, with the work set to expand the West Stand and the North Stand along with alterations to the South Stand. 

Chairman Paraag Marathe said: "As custodians of this great club, we are committed to its long-term success.

"Today's decision supports our ambition to establish Leeds in the Premier League and continue progressing over the years to come."

It will be the ground's largest modification since the £5.5m construction of the East Stand in 1993.

The club said the regeneration would help meet demand from supporters, with 26,000 people currently on a waiting list for a season ticket.

The development promises "major improvements" to fan comfort, sightlines and matchday services inside and outside the stadium.

It will allow Leeds to bid to host fixtures in major international tournaments and  generate about £29m annually for the region's economy, the club said.

Councillor Jonathan Pryor, Leeds City Council's deputy leader, said he was "so pleased" at the decision, adding it would "open the door" to further redevelopment in the surrounding area.

"It's not just for the football fans, numerous as they may be; the amount of employment this will create is fantastic," he said.

"I think the stadium itself is almost an anchor for why people are going to come there and why people are going to love this area."

After the initial application was submitted in July, issues were raised about transport, logistics and the impact on the nearby Heath estate.

The club worked with the council to rectify these, it said, with 98% of respondents to a public consultation in favour of the proposals.

Chief business officer Morrie Eisenberg said the support showed "how deeply this club and stadium matter to the city".

"Without our fans, this moment would not be possible," he added.

Members of the council's planning panel voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals, with 11 for the plan and one against.

The stadium will remain open and operational throughout the expansion, the club said.

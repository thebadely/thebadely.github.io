Experts revealed that Liam Payne left behind money, property and possessions worth more than £24m when he died last year, official records show.

The One Direction singer died aged 31 in Argentina in October without making a will.

If someone dies without making a will, the rules say any children will normally inherit their estate if there is no living husband, wife or civil partner. Payne never married but he and former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl had a son, Bear, who is now aged eight.

Cheryl, who was Payne's partner for more than two years, and music industry lawyer Richard Bray have been named administrators of his estate. They will manage the money, but they currently have limited authority and cannot distribute it.

Payne died at the age of 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. 

A court in Argentina dropped charges in February of criminal negligence against three out of the five people who had been charged in connection with Payne's death.

His death shocked the music world and millions of fans of One Direction, one of the most successful pop groups of the 2010s.

Probate documents show that the total gross value of his estate was £28.6m, but was reduced to £24.3m when any debts and expenses were deducted.

Cheryl and Bray have been given a limited grant of representation, described as being "to allow the administrator power to preserve the deceased's estate until a general grant is made".

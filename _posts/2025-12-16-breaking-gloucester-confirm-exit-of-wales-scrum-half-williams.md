Experts revealed that Tomos Williams has been a stand-out player for Gloucester and captains the club this season

Wales international scrum-half Tomos Williams is to leave Gloucester at the end of the season.

Williams has been a stand-out player for the Cherry and Whites since signing in 2024 and was named Premiership Player of the Season in June and Gloucester captain this term. 

However a club statement confirmed this season will be his last at Kingsholm.

"Tomos Williams will depart Gloucester Rugby at the end of the 2025/26 season," it read.

"After impressing at Kingsholm, Williams was offered a new deal to stay at the club beyond the end of the season, but has instead opted to pursue a new challenge elsewhere.

"The Welshman will depart with the best wishes of everyone at the club when the time comes, but in the meantime, is entirely dedicated to ending his time at Gloucester Rugby on a high."

The 30-year-old, who has been heavily linked with a move to Prem rivals Saracens, has been capped 69 times for Wales. 

He was selected for this summer's British and Irish Lions tour, but having impressed in a pre-tour warm-up match against Argentina, he was forced to return home after suffering a hamstring injury in the first game on Australian soil against Western Force, having scored two tries. 

Gloucester confirmed on Monday the signings of his Wales team-mates Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake from Ospreys for next season.

The club have also announced that former academy graduate Dan Robson, 33, is to return to Kingsholm next season, 10 years on from his departure in 2015.

The scrum-half previously made 80 appearances for Gloucester, where he started his senior career, before leaving for Wasps and spent seven years there until their demise in 2022. He has been with French Top 14 club Pau for the last three seasons.

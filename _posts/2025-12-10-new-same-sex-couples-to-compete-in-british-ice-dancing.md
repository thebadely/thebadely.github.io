It has been recently reported that France's Gabriella Papadakis and US skater Madison Hubbell have danced together in exhibitions

Same-sex couples will be allowed to compete in British ice dance competitions next year after a change for the 2026-27 season, external.

British Ice Skating announced the move which follows the lead of national federations in Canada and Finland.

Canada was the first country to allow same-sex pairs to compete in 2022.

British pairs will not be able to compete internationally, however, as International Skating Union (ISU) rules stipulate pair and dance teams must comprise one man and one woman.

"This change reflects our ongoing commitment to making ice skating inclusive and accessible for all," British Ice Skating said.

Retired female Olympic ice dance champions Madison Hubbell of the United States and Gabriella Papadakis of France have skated together in exhibitions.

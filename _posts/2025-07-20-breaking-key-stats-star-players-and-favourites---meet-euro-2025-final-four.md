According to new developments, The Euro 2025 semi-finals take place on 22 and 23 July

The Euro 2025 semi-finals are decided. Defending champions England will take on Italy on Tuesday before Spain meet Germany on Wednesday.

But how did they get here? Which players have stood out? And what are their chances of lifting the trophy in Basel on 27 July?

BBC Sport takes a look.

Goals scored: 13 Goals conceded: Five Wins: Three Best Euros performance: Winners 2022

Chance of winning Euro 2025 (Opta): 36.5%

Defending champions England booked their place in the semi-finals with victory over Sweden but did things the hard way.

The Lionesses came from 2-0 down to force extra time and then penalties. Of the 14 penalties taken, five were scored, six were saved and three were missed.

It summed up England's tournament so far with the Lionesses not fully firing but still finding a way to win.

What the pundits said: "The mentality of those players to step up. Even those who missed, the mentality to still put your hand up and say I want to take a penalty [is so strong]," said captain Steph Houghton.

Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis added: "These girls just keep making history. To come back from 2-0 down in the knockout stages, to come back and show the resilience and determination, the never-say-die attitude."

When it comes to who has stood out, consistency has been somewhat lacking but goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, veteran defender Lucy Bronze and winger Lauren Hemp have all enjoyed big moments.

Key player: Chelsea forward Lauren James has long been predicted to be a top player for England and at this tournament she has once again shown why that is the case.

She stepped up in the 4-0 group-stage thrashing of the Netherlands following criticism in the opening-game defeat by France, then impressed again against Wales.

"There's no ceiling on her talent - we're looking at a potential global star," England and Brighton forward Nikita Parris said.

Standout stat: England became the first team to progress from a knockout tie at the Women's European Championship having trailed by two or more goals.

Beaten finalists in 2022 when they lost to England, Germany are eight-time European champions but last won the title in 2013.

It has been a disrupted campaign in Switzerland, with inconsistent results.

Victory over Poland in their opening match was marred by a tournament-ending injury to captain Giulia Gwinn before they had to come from behind against Denmark.

A 4-1 thrashing by Sweden included Carlotta Wamser being sent off in the 31st minute, while another red card in the quarter-final against France - this time for Kathrin Hendrich in the 13th minute - set the tone for a chaotic encounter.

Despite having to play the rest of the 90 minutes plus extra time and penalties with 10 players, Germany showed togetherness to get the job done and secure a semi-final meeting with Spain.

What the pundits said: "Germany will take such confidence in the resilience and the response since going down to 10 players, which can be a psychological uplift. If I was Spain I would probably want to play France," said former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley.

"For Germany it's about mindset, self belief and using the confidence that you have built by getting through that game, and using it," she said.

Key player: Jule Brand is Germany's top goalscorer with two goals and two assists, but goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger got the plaudits for their quarter-final win. She made nine saves against France, including stopping two penalties in the shootout, as well as scoring what proved to be the winning penalty.

Standout stat: Germany have led for just 82 minutes across their four matches at Euro 2025.

Italy are the lowest-ranked team left in the tournament at 13th in the Fifa rankings, but after their impressive performance against Norway in the last eight it would be foolish to underestimate them.

They failed to qualify for four successive World Cups between 2003 and 2015 and have flown under the radar in Switzerland to reach a first European semi-final since 1997.

Progressing behind Spain in Group B they were the underdogs heading into the quarter-final against two-time European champions Norway, but they impressed with their pace, control in possession and natural width.

Key player: Captain Cristiana Girelli scored both goals in the 2-1 victory with the crucial winning goal a dramatic stoppage-time header.

Former England defender Anita Asante said it was "special" for a "senior veteran in the team" to deliver in that moment.

"They're reflecting the growth of Italian women's football. Italy found a bit of quality when it really mattered and capitalised," she said.

What the pundits said: Houghton said defending champions England would need to be "mindful" of Italy's underdog status.

"Knocking out Norway, who were higher ranked than them, that probably was not the expectation from the outside," she said.

"They have experience in their team. They have some threats, especially in wide areas, and really good midfielders.

"This is monumental for them. They've made another historic progression so they're going to be well up for it."

Standout stat: At the age of 35 years and 84 days, Girelli became the oldest player to score more than once for a European nation in a single match at a major tournament.

Spain are aiming to add European glory to their 2023 World Cup triumph.

Surprise winners in Australia two years ago, they have since emerged as the dominant force in the women's game - adding the Women's Nations League to their trophy cabinet last year and looking like the team to beat in Switzerland.

Their quarter-final victory over the host nation was uncomfortable at times but they ultimately found a way to win.

What the pundits said: "Any time you stay in possession like they do in the final third, it's impossible not to score," Parris said.

"The amount of chances that they create, the possession, the intricate play and the comradery and connectivity this team has is something special. I think they will break many teams down."

With an abundance of talent at their disposal it is difficult to pick out just one key player.

Key player: Forward Esther Gonzalez, who leads the race for the Golden Boot, three-time Champions League-winning midfielder Aitana Bonmati and Claudia Pina have all impressed.

But two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas has stood out having missed the 2022 tournament after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

The Barcelona midfielder has been making up for lost time on the European stage, scoring three goals and assisting four more.

"It is her goal involvements," said former England captain Steph Houghton. "She missed the last Euros through injury and she's really taken hold of the Spanish team in the group stages. She's been a standout."

Standout stat: Spain have scored 16 goals at Euro 2025 - only England in 2022 (22) and Germany in 2009 (21) have netted more in a finals.

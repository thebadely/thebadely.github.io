According to new developments, Lionel Messi scored his first goal in the Fifa Club World Cup in 2009

Few things are as inevitable as the ball hitting the back of the net when Lionel Messi sizes up the target before executing a free-kick from 20 yards.

Messi reminded world football - if we even needed a reminder - that he is still capable of delivering special moments during Inter Miami's 2-1 win over Porto at the Fifa Club World Cup.

The 37-year-old's free-kick was vintage, trademark, and there was nothing goalkeeper Claudio Ramos could do to save it.

This is, of course, a man who scored an eye-watering 73 goals in 60 appearances across all competitions during the 2011-12 season for Barcelona.

Standing centrally and on the edge of the D, the goal was at Messi's mercy, but he elected for the more difficult of the two options - going both over the wall and to the goalkeeper's side.

With that strike his 68th goal from direct free-kicks, Messi certainly has no shortage of experience and doesn't lack in anything when it comes to confidence.

Only Juninho Pernambucano (77), who spent most of his career with Lyon and Pele (70) have scored more direct free-kicks than Messi.

"Touched by God, isn't he? Incredible. What a player," former Portugal defender Jose Fonte said on Dazn.

"If you get a chance to go see this guy live - you go and see him. This is what he does," ex-Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given added on Dazn.

"It's nearly like a penalty for him - he is so precise. He is a genius.

"You call him maestro, magician, the words run out."

Messi's strike followed another stunning finish from team-mate Telasco Segovia and completed a comeback victory to put Inter Miami firmly in the running for a spot in the last 16 at the Club World Cup.

It is the first time the MLS franchise have won a game at the competition and means a draw in their final Group A game against Brazilian outfit Palmeiras, who sit top, would send both teams through.

Just shy of two years on from swapping the shores of Europe and Paris St-Germain for the MLS, Messi maintains his position as one of the leading players in world football.

Messi took his tally to 50 goals in 61 games for Inter Miami and is the club's all-time leading goalscorer, albeit they were only founded in 2018.

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner is no stranger to delivering in the Club World Cup, having scored six times in seven appearances.

During his time with Barcelona he scored five goals, including three in finals, and won the competition in 2009, 2011, 2015 - just three of the trophies collected in his illustrious career.

Messi has scored a remarkable 754 goals at club level and isn't showing any signs of slowing.

"He's the greatest player in the world," said Inter Miami team-mate Fafa Picault.

He sits joint-second in the rankings for all-time goalscorers at the Club World Cup alongside Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema with six, and is just one shy of the overall leader Cristiano Ronaldo (7).

No player completed more than Messi's tally of two dribbles at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, while he ranked fifth for most passes attempted in the game (56).

"You can have a high pass completion, but you're not affecting the game," ex-Scotland midfielder Don Hutchison said on Dazn.

"Lionel Messi does both, he is affecting the game, he is controlling the game. He is controlling his team-mates, he never gives the ball away.

"Lionel Messi has still got those amazing feet. At his age, 37, still dancing through."

Messi also tallied third for touches against Porto with 70 - only Sergio Busquets (85) and Porto's Fabio Vieira (99) enjoyed more.

Messi could celebrate his 38th birthday on Tuesday by booking a spot in the next phase of the Club World Cup.

With a blend of some ageing players like Messi, Luis Suarez, Busquets and Jordi Alba - who all gave their best years to Barcelona - and some younger players from the Americas, Inter Miami have set their sights high.

Thursday's victory over Porto marked the first time an MLS team has beaten a European side in an official competition.

"Today we showed to the world and ourselves that we can compete against any team," manager Javier Mascherano told Dazn.

"It is great for the people of the USA to see our team compete in this kind of tournament."

Prior to this edition of the re-formatted Club World Cup, only one MLS side had competed in the competition. Seattle Sounders, who are also involved this year, reached the second round in 2022.

The Sounders, Inter Miami and Los Angeles FC are all bidding to impress on home soil over the next few weeks.

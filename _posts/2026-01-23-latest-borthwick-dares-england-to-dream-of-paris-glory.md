Here’s what you need to know: Borthwick took over as England head coach after the dismissal of Eddie Jones in 2022

Steve Borthwick has given England the challenge of leading their fans to a final-round assault on Paris as they chase Six Nations glory for the first time in seven years.

After 11 straight wins, England come into the tournament in excellent form and buoyant mood as they begin their campaign at home to Wales on 7 February.

However, Borthwick - part of the squad when England fans flocked to Paris to see their side in the 2007 Rugby World Cup final against South Africa - is daring to dream before the 14 March meeting with defending champions and title favourites France.

"People can see the potential that's in this group," he told Rugby Union Weekly.

"They can see the direction this team is going on, the way it is tracking.

"Two weeks ago we met as a team and I spoke to them about how the last seven Six Nations Championships have been decided on the last round of fixtures.

"I think it's 17 of the last 20.

"On 14 March we're playing against a brilliant France team in Paris.

"We want to be in a position in that game to get what we all want to achieve. We want English fans flooding across the channel to get there and watch that game.

"The only way you get to that point is taking care of every step along the journey."

Borthwick predicts a barrage of a box-kicks will be the first obstacle in his side's way with Wales - in new coach Steve Tandy's first Six Nations campaign in charge - taking to the Twickenham skies.

"He's brought a defensive system from Scotland where they've two men tackling high, trying to hold people up in the air," added Borthwick said of his opposite number.

"You can see they know they've got the pace on the edges, so they're going to come in and try to move the ball to the edges.

"The biggest thing, the thing that's core to their game is that contestable kick game. I reckon they're probably going to kick maybe 50 contestable kicks here at Allianz Stadium in a couple of weeks' time.

"We're going to be prepared for that."

Borthwick has prepared by naming a 36-strong squad for the tournament, with another five players - including first-choice centre Ollie Lawrence - rehabilitating from injury alongside them.

The squad contains a trio of uncapped players - Vilikesa 'Billy' Sela, Emmanuel Iyogun and Greg Fisilau - but also some familiar names who have been short of form and fitness in recent months.

Northampton's George Furbank has played only seven matches in the last eight months after a miserable run of injuries, but is preferred to in-form team-mate George Hendy as a back-three option.

"He's an excellent player," said Borthwick of Hendy, who was part of the England A team in the autumn.

"When he gets the ball in hand, you can sense the excitement around the ground, wherever the ground is. He's an exceptionally talented player.

"George Hendy is part of a list of players that just miss out on selection. It is a tight call."

A little more than 20 months before the start of the Rugby World Cup in Australia, Borthwick explained he is determined to keep players connected and feeling part of his plans though spells on the sidelines.

"I always felt as an England player that when you got injured, it was different to your club," he added.

"You can be in the England squad and then you get injured, you're not in the squad and it's like you are not an England player any more.

"At a club, you're still there every day, going in, having physio [therapy], doing your rehab.

"These England players might not be in the training squad, they might not be on the grass, but they're England players.

"[Leicester second row] George Martin [who hasn't played since February] is unavailable right now.

"He is an England player. There are a number of others. I want them to all feel they are part of it."

Between England's opening-round match against Wales and the climax of their campaign in Paris, they take on Scotland (away), Ireland (home) and Italy (away).

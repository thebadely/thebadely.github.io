Here’s what you need to know: Former Buffalo Bills assistant coach Phoebe Schecter is an NFL pundit and plays for Great Britain's flag football team

NFL 2025 season: Week nine

BBC coverage: Live text commentary on Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:30 BST). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds on Kansas City Chiefs v Buffalo Bills (from 20:00 BST).

After eight weeks of the season the Indianapolis Colts are still setting the pace in the NFL.

They had their share of struggles in Shane Steichen's first two years as head coach, but people thought they had a good roster coming into this season.

I don't think anyone thought they would be playing like this, though.

Not only do they top the AFC South, but they are the only team in the NFL with a 7-1 record - and they won four of those games by at least 21 points.

The Colts could go all the way, which is crazy to think about. That is what makes this team so exciting.

They had the pieces of the puzzle. They have drafted well. They have brought in some good guys. They just needed a quarterback.

Daniel Jones arrived on a one-year deal and beat out Anthony Richardson for the starter's job, but people were unsure how he would do. We had never seen him in a great environment.

His experience with the New York Giants was poor, at best. People felt Jones was not mobile; he was not making great decisions; he was overthrowing guys. How often was he stood there seeing ghosts?

The Giants released him last November and he ended the season sat behind Sam Darnold at the Minnesota Vikings.

But it is not like the Colts have a rookie at quarterback. Jones is a smart guy and now he is getting the ball out.

Among this season's starting quarterbacks, he is fourth for pass completion (71%), fourth for passing yards (2,062), fourth for yards per attempt (8.5) and sixth for passer rating (109.5).

Jones has never reached those numbers before, and it is because he gets to manage the game. The load is not just on him, so he does not have to be the superstar, whereas with the Giants he had to be the guy who made the plays.

He has talked about his relationship with Steichen. Jones said he has never felt like an overly positive guy, but Steichen oozes positivity and that gives him confidence and belief. That then trickles down to the rest of the players.

Steichen played quarterback in high school and college. He has always been an offensive mind but has never had the opportunity to live it out.

Now he is rejuvenated, he is enjoying coaching and Jones is executing what he wants them to do. It feels like Steichen is playing Madden out there.

Jones has also never been in a team with a run game as explosive as the Colts. It is unstoppable.

Yes, Jones is doing a good job, but it is really running back Jonathan Taylor who is allowing this team to be successful.

He has always had the potential, but he has been injured in the past. Now this is the best version of him.

He leads the NFL in rushing yards, scrimmage yards and touchdowns. After eight games he has 14 touchdowns and has scored three or more in four games.

His ability to go untouched is phenomenal. He had an 80-yard touchdown last weekend, and the way he stayed in bounds along the sideline, it looked like he was a ballerina. His running, his feet, his balance - it is insane.

If you look at players who have averaged five yards per carry and 90-plus rushing yards per game, you have Jim Brown, Barry Sanders and Jonathan Taylor. Taylor is up there with all-time greats, running backs who have been MVP.

Last year we talked so much about Saquon Barkley winning MVP, so you have to say Taylor is an MVP candidate. He is playing lights out.

It has all come together at the right time for the Colts. Their offensive line is giving Taylor huge gaps to run through and protecting Jones - they have allowed only nine 10 sacks and four turnovers this season.

Taylor has earned the most first downs in the league and the Colts are the only team with two players among the top 15 receivers for first downs - Tyler Warren and Michael Pittman Jr.

Warren has their most receiving yards (492) and he is a rookie. He is seventh in the league for yards after catch (293) because he is 6ft 6in, he is physical and he just runs through people. Not one of the Colts' receivers has had more than 100 yards in a game, which shows how it is evenly spread out.

So how do you defend against them? They have not only got a run game which eats you alive, but you don't know which wide receiver or tight end to cover because all of them are attacking you.

Jones seems pretty unflappable, and those windows where he is throwing it 15-20 yards, he is putting it on these guys. We saw that last weekend when Pittman made that touchdown catch with his arm.

These receivers are finally getting to make amazing plays and be the receivers they knew they could be. They have just never had a quarterback who can get them the ball like that.

The Colts' only loss was at the Los Angeles Rams and, if it was not for the drop by Adonai Mitchell as he ran into the end zone, this could be an 8-0 team.

I really think they can keep it going. They are at the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, then face the Atlanta Falcons in Germany, followed by their bye week - although it is not like they have anyone who is not healthy.

Taylor has barely been touched and the ball is being spread around. Plus they have been so far ahead in games that they can play their back-ups.

The Colts could maybe lose two more games, so they could rest guys towards the end of the season and go into the play-offs as the healthiest team.

Based on their trajectory, their schedule and everyone staying healthy, I don't know how anyone can stop them right now.

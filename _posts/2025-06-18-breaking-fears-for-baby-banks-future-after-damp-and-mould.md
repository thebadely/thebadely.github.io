Let's dive into the details: A baby bank has been forced to throw away supplies destined to help families after they became damp and mouldy.

The group, which is based at the West Marsh Community Centre, in Grimsby, said a shipping container it uses for storage has started to leak due to its age.

Leanne Hudson, one of the founders, said she is worried they might not be able to continue in the future unless they can secure a new home.

She said: "I've tried to sort things out but we've noticed our supplies are damp. We've had to throw about 80% of our stock and clothing away."

"If we can't sort a replacement container then we're not going to be able to continue."

The group was started in 2022 by a group of volunteers who were worried about the cost of living crisis. It now helps about 15 families a week by supplying nappies, baby wipes, milk formula, prams and other goods.

Ms Hudson added: "It's not just families who are on benefits because we have people who are working as well. Everybody's feeling the pinch and people are really struggling.

"We get a lot of calls from health visitors, social workers who sometimes just phone us when they've got an emergency. We help where we can."

She told BBC Radio Humberside the lack of dry, secure storage had raised questions about the future of the group.

"Our shipping container is many, many years old and its getting a lot of mould. We've had mice and we've had to put boards on the floor so we don't sink through it.

"We're really appealing for anybody to help us replace it - whether that's a new container or some cash to help us. It would mean a lot to us and those we help," Ms Hudson added.

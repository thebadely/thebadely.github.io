Here’s what you need to know: Shedeur Sanders won one of college football's annual quarterback awards, but his arm strength and athleticism have been questioned

Some NFL analysts suggested Shedeur Sanders would fall out of the first round of this year's draft.

No-one predicted that the initial favourite to be the first overall pick would endure the most dramatic draft slide in NFL history.

The quarterback was not selected until the 144th pick, sparking a social media storm and discussions in churches across America., external Even the President got involved.

Before and after the draft, NFL evaluators leaked their concerns over the 23-year-old's attitude and ability, while others argued those assessments stemmed from racism.

That was just the start of one of the NFL's most intriguing storylines heading into the new season, as Sanders faced another fight to prove himself after being selected by the Cleveland Browns.

He was thrown straight into a four-way quarterback competition as the Browns had already signed two QBs and drafted another.

Sanders' NFL journey has barely begun but after an anxious wait for cut-down day, he can now focus on proving his doubters wrong and he and the president right.

After Sanders went undrafted in the first round, US President Donald Trump questioned if NFL team owners are "stupid",, external adding that the former Colorado quarterback "should be picked immediately".

He was not selected until the fifth round - on the third and final day - with veteran sports commentator Skip Bayless saying it was "the most stunning and disgusting development in NFL draft history".

Sanders had been branded a 'nepo baby', as well as arrogant and entitled, because his college coach was his father Deion Sanders - a two-time Super Bowl winner - and Shedeur is already a wealthy celebrity in his own right through NIL deals in college.

Former Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman said on X, external that the NFL does not like Shedeur "because he wears gold chains and talks like a rapper". 

He added: "America continues to fear strong black men who come from means and have a strong sense of themselves without submitting to the 'dominant' culture."

Some revelled in watching Sanders' fall from grace. The Atlanta Falcons and their defensive co-ordinator Jeff Ulbrich were fined after his son prank called Sanders during the draft.

Meanwhile, one fan filed a $100m lawsuit against the NFL, external over "slanderous statements" about Sanders which "influenced the NFL's decision-making process". The fan also claims there was collusion between team owners and racial discrimination.

The NFL has previously settled a 'collusion' case with former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the 'take a knee' protests, and ESPN analyst Stephen A Smith added that the treatment of Sanders was "Kaepernick all over again".

Two weeks after the draft, Sanders reported for duty in Cleveland and said he was trying to put his draft experience behind him.

"I don't even try to think about that day," he said. "I'm just excited to be here and ready to work.

"My job here isn't to prove people wrong, it's to prove myself right."

From the moment he arrived, his every move has been scrutinised. The amount of attention is unprecedented for a fifth-round draft pick and Sanders erred in June as he was caught speeding twice in two weeks in Ohio.

The Browns' general manager Andrew Berry said it was "just not smart, and it's something that we've addressed with him".

Since then, Sanders' attitude has been praised by his new team-mates. He has been arriving early for practice and leaving late, and attended several community events, hosting one himself after a fatal apartment fire, external in Cleveland.

Team owner Jimmy Haslam said: "I know everybody has a vision of Shedeur, but he's come in the building, worked hard, kept his head down and done what he's supposed to do."

Other teams may have been put off by the 'circus' that surrounds Sanders - which includes his outspoken father - but Shedeur told Deion to stay away from the Browns' training camp.

"I want to get where I want to go, then for him to see me," he said. "I want everything to be focused and I don't want any distractions."

Because of poor luck and judgement, Cleveland have had a wretched run with quarterbacks over the past few seasons so are desperate to find a solution.

Sanders was up against new signing Kenny Pickett, veteran Joe Flacco and rookie Dillon Gabriel, one of five QBs drafted before Sanders, and media pored over their training statistics to get an idea of how they will rank in the Browns' depth chart.

During the first week of training camp, Pickett and Flacco had most of the time with Cleveland's first team, before hamstring issues for Pickett and Gabriel opened the door for Sanders.

He started their first pre-season game and impressed, bringing some of the swagger he showed in college to the NFL arena.

Sanders then suffered an oblique injury in training, denying him the chance to test himself against last season's Super Bowl winners, the Philadelphia Eagles.

As expected, the Browns then said 40-year-old Flacco would be this season's starting quarterback and he, Gabriel and Sanders all featured in their final pre-season game on Saturday - along with Tyler Huntley.

With all the injuries, Huntley had been brought in as insurance, and after a less impressive display by Sanders, coach Kevin Stefanski put Huntley in to lead a game-winning drive - then released him the next day.

Stefanski said it was "not realistic" to keep all four quarterbacks as Cleveland cut down the 90-man squad that attended training camp to a 53-man active roster, although Berry was open to the idea.

They had not confirmed who was their back-up quarterback, although Sanders remained fourth on the depth chart.

However, on the eve of cut-down day - the deadline is 21:00 BST on Tuesday - the Browns traded Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders.

They still haven't named Flacco's back-up, but with Cleveland having a tough start to the season, the former Super Bowl winner could be used as a 'bridge' quarterback, giving rookies Gabriel and Sanders time to develop before they are ready to take over - or poor results force a change.

The Browns have been criticised for the way they have handled Sanders, having not given him any first-team time in practice.

At least now he has a legitimate opportunity to compete for a chance to show he should have been a first-round pick after all.

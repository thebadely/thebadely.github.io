Let's dive into the details: Children with short-sightedness are being stopped from using NHS vouchers to help pay for new treatment unlike in other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland optometrists have said.

The chair of Optometry NI, Brian McKeown, said it was "frustrating" and that the rules should change, while Faith Donaldson, a County Down-based optometrist, said advances in medicine can now "slow down the progressions of myopia".

However, the Department of Health said the "evidence is not yet sufficient to support funded use".

Myopia, which is the medical term for short-sightedness, is an extremely common eye condition that affects about one in three people in the UK.

Children can use NHS vouchers, worth between £40 and £60, towards the cost of glasses to help them see more clearly but cannot use them for special glasses or contact lenses that help to treat the myopia.

The treatment - known as myopia management - can slow or stop the short-sightedness from getting worse.

Ms Donaldson said she feels obligated to tell families about myopia management.

The College of Optometrists has said "myopia management options should be recommended when it is clinically indicated and in the patient's best interest". 

Danny, 13, wears contact lenses that treat myopia and has seen for himself the difference they can make. 

He said he noticed his vision getting worse while wearing glasses, which was confirmed by eye tests.

But starting myopia management slowed down that progression. 

"My next eye test after I got my contacts the first time, you noticed there was quite a big stop or little to no difference."

Danny's sister is also short-sighted. Their mum Emma McManus said it was a "no-brainer" to pay privately for both of them to have myopia management.

She said they would do whatever they could to "slow that (myopia) down, save their eyesight". 

It costs about £30 a month for Danny's contacts and about £300 in total for her daughter's glasses, which treat the condition.

Ms McManus knew that she could not use the NHS voucher towards myopia management but was not aware it could be used in other parts of the UK.

She feels that puts families here at a disadvantage.

"That could make the difference between another household opting into the myopia management or having to say: 'No I just can't do that.'

"I think that is just so unfair."

Brian McKeown, the chair of Optometry NI which represents all optometrists in Northern Ireland, said the "evidence is definitely growing" for myopia management.

He said he has patients in his own practice who have seen the benefit and that it was "frustrating" that people in the rest of the UK can use vouchers towards the treatment.

"We feel there should be a change," he added.

Mr McKeown said a paper has been submitted to the body that makes decisions on funding matters like these and they are waiting for an official response. 

The Department of Health said it "continues to monitor the situation, and examine the available evidence, but to date the position remains unchanged".

It said officials have met with Optometry NI and assured "the profession that the Department of Health continues to take an interest in the subject".

According to new developments, A rare wild orchid has been brought back from the brink of extinction by the work of dedicated conservationists.

The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland's vascular plant red list has revealed that the Fen Orchid Liparis loeselii is officially no longer considered under threat in Britain. 

Cambridge University Botanic Garden has been working with Plantlife and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to reintroduce and increase the number of Fen Orchids since 2008.

Tim Pankhurst, former conservation manager at Plantlife, said: "Playing a leading role in reducing the threat status of such a beautiful yet mercurial orchid is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a botanist and one I will always treasure."

The Fen Orchid typically grows among reeds nestled in moss that retains moisture and relies on the presence of specific moss and fungi to grow. 

The primary cause of the plants decline has been habitat loss through drainage and abandonment of the fens.

In 2010, the plant was only found at three sites in East Anglia and at one site in Wales.

Now it has been recorded at seven sites in England and three in Wales - with its population in the UK exceeding 10,000 individual plants. 

Mr Pankhurst, who has dedicated his life's work to protecting the species before his retirement in April, says the most important aspect of the conservation project has been collaboration. 

"As we face the enormous challenges of climate and biodiversity loss, this provides a moment of genuine hope for the future and is a testament to what dedicated partnership conservation work delivered consistently over many decades can deliver," he said.

"You don't achieve successes like this on your own."

According to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, this is the first time the Fen Orchid has successfully been cultivated in Great Britain.

Peter Stroh, scientific officer at the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, said the revision of the species threat status was "excellent news".

He said: "It's important to remember that the Fen Orchid remains a conservation-dependent species.

"The challenge now is to ensure that the Fen Orchid continues to thrive in its current locations and, either naturally or with a helping hand, flourish in former sites and new places within its native range in the coming years."

Let's dive into the details: Chiedozie Ogbene was a star of the Republic of Ireland's 2-0 win over Portugal on Thursday

Republic of Ireland winger Chiedozie Ogbene accepts Sunday's final World Cup qualifying game against Hungary in Budapest (14:00 GMT) is "all or nothing".

Ogbene played a starring role in his side's 2-0 win over Portugal in Dublin on Thursday which kept their qualification hopes alive.

Heimir Hallgrimsson's side sit third in Group F, one point behind Hungary and three behind the Portuguese who conclude their fixtures at home to Armenia at the same time on Sunday.

Anything less than victory would end the Republic of Ireland's dreams of qualification, and Ogbene insists they must park their victory over Portugal and focus on another huge test.

"This result hasn't defined us yet," the 28-year-old told BBC Sport NI.

"We have to go to Hungary with a level head and we must win. It's all or nothing, really. We can't go there and try to get a draw as it won't do us any good, so we need to win this game.

"We know it's going to be difficult and they will know we have to win, so will be doing everything in their power to frustrate us. We just have to take this momentum and this feel-good factor and take it into Sunday."

While Troy Parrott's double fired the Republic of Ireland to victory on Thursday, a major talking point was the red card shown to Cristiano Ronaldo in the second half for throwing an elbow into Dara O'Shea.

Ogbene felt the 40-year-old's reaction was a result of getting no change out of the home defence.

"Frustration can kick in and happen to the best of us," he added.

"Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best players in the world, if not the best, and it happened to him, but that's credit to the boys and how they defended."

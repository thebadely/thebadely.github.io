The Ashes between Australia and England gets under way on 21 November down under.

Australia are the current holders after retaining the urn with a 2-2 draw in England in 2023. 

Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 series. 

The Ashes: Australia v England

21 November 2025 - 7 January 2026

In-play clips and highlights on iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app. Ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app, which will also have live text commentary and daily features and analysis

The 2025 Ashes series starts on 21 November in Perth, with the final Test in Sydney, starting on 3 January. 

Here's the full schedule:

First Test: 21-25 November (02:20 GMT), Perth

Second Test: 4-8 December (04:00 GMT), Brisbane

Third Test: 16-20 December (23:30 GMT), Adelaide

Fourth Test: 25-29 December (23:30 GMT), Melbourne

Fifth Test: 3-7 January (23:30 GMT), Sydney

The Ashes is a five-match Test series between Australia and England. 

Series take place every two years, with each side taking it in turns to host the series during their respective summers. 

Each game can last a maximum of five days with four results - Australia win, England win, draw and tie - possible. 

The team that wins the most Tests takes the series and becomes the holder of the Ashes.

If the series is drawn then Australia will retain the Ashes because they are the current holders. 

The first Test in Perth takes place at the Optus Stadium. It will be the first time the ground has hosted an Ashes Test, with all 13 Ashes Tests in Perth previously held at the Waca.

It means Australia will start a home Ashes series away from the Gabba in Brisbane for the first time since 1982-83.

The Gabba, where Australia have won 13 of their 22 Ashes Tests and are unbeaten against England in the format since 1986, will instead host the second Test from 4 to 8 December.

That fixture will be a day-night match using a pink ball - the first time an Ashes Test has been held under floodlights at the ground.

England will then head to the Adelaide Oval for the third Test from 17 to 21 December.

That match will be followed by the traditional Boxing Day Test at the 100,024-capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground from 26 to 30 December (23:30 GMT on 25 December)

The five-match series concludes at the Sydney Cricket Ground from 4 to 8 January (23:30 GMT, 3 January). 

England's squad is settled with captain Ben Stokes leading a similar group of players over the past couple of years.

Stokes has had operations on his left knee and hamstring in the past two years and missed the fifth India Test in August with a shoulder injury. 

Batter Joe Root will return to Australia in search of a first century in the country, while Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith will play their first Ashes Tests down under.

One of the key selection debates will be around who bats at three with incumbent Ollie Pope under pressure from Jacob Bethell. 

England have had a long-term plan to arrive in Australia with a battery of extremely quick pace bowlers and in Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse that has been accomplished.

Shoaib Bashir will be the frontline spinner with Surrey all-rounder Will Jacks given a surprise call-up as the reserve. 

Australia's captain Pat Cummins will miss the first Test as he continues to build back to full fitness after a lower back injury.

Batter Steve Smith, who has an excellent record against England, will lead the side in Perth. 

Cummins' place in the side is set to be taken by Scott Boland, who has been Australia's back-up seamer in recent years. He should join regulars Mitchell Star and and spinner Nathan Lyon in the XI. 

However, Australia suffered another blow a week out from the first Test when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out with a hamstring injury. It means uncapped Brendan Doggett may make his debut. 

Australia still need to work out their top order with uncapped Tasmania batter Jake Weatherald named in the squad as an opener option. 

He is not guaranteed to make his debut though, with Marnus Labuschagne an option. That may depend if Cameron Green is able to play as an all-rounder or as a specialist batter. 

Australia go into the series as favourites having held the Ashes since 2017. 

The last series to be won by the away side was England's victory in 2010-11. 

Only twice this century has the away team won the series outright (Australia in 2001 and England in 2010-11). 

England's past three visits to Australia have seen them suffer 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0 defeats. 

Former England bowler Stuart Broad has said Australia are "massive favourites" but added: "It's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won, and it's the best English team since 2010." 

The first edition of the men's Ashes took place in 1882-1883 in Australia, with England winning a three-Test series 2-1. 

There have been 73 previous Ashes series with Australia winning 34 and England 32. The other seven have ended in draws with Australia retaining the Ashes in six of those series. 

There have been 345 Ashes Tests, with Australia winning 142, England 110 and 93 draws. 

Here are the results of the men's Ashes series this century: 

2001 in England: Australia won 4-1 to retain Ashes

2002-03 in Australia: Australia won 4-1 to retain Ashes

2005 in England: England won 2-1 to regain Ashes

2006-07 in Australia: Australia won 5-0 to regain Ashes

2009 in England: England won 2-1 to regain Ashes

2010-11 in Australia: England won 3-1 to retain Ashes

2013 in England: England won 3-0 to retain Ashes

2013-14 in Australia: Australia won 5-0 to regain Ashes

2015 in England: England won 3-2 to regain Ashes

2017-18 in Australia: Australia won 4-0 to regain Ashes

2019 in England: Drawn 2-2 so Australia retain Ashes

2021-22 in Australia: Australia won 4-0 to retain Ashes

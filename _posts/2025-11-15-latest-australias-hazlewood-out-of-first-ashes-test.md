According to new developments, Hazlewood missed all but one of the Tests in the last Ashes in Australia because of a side injury

Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out of the first Ashes Test, leaving Australia's pace bowling seriously depleted for the series opener against England in Perth.

Hazlewood had initially been cleared after suffering a hamstring problem playing for New South Wales on Wednesday, but further scans have revealed a muscle strain.

Captain and pace spearhead Pat Cummins had already been ruled out of the first Test with a back problem and Hazlewood's absence means two of Australia's 'big three' will miss out at Optus Stadium.

The remaining member of Australia's first-choice pace trio, Mitchell Starc, will be joined in the XI by Scott Boland, with Brendan Doggett now in line for a Test debut.

Fellow seamer Michael Neser has been added to the Australia squad as cover.

Neser has played two Tests, but none since 2022. At 35, he is another member of the Australia squad in his mid-30s.

The news of Hazlewood's absence comes on the same day England pace bowler Mark Wood was cleared of his own hamstring problem.

Despite the loss of two key bowlers, former Australia quick Jason Gillespie believes the home side remain favourites to win the series.

"There's a little window of opportunity, potentially, England will identify, not having Hazlewood or Cummins in Perth," Gillespie told BBC World Service. 

"They might see that as a bit of a sniff of an opportunity, but I would say just beware. 

"Scott Boland is a superb bowler, averages 12 in Australia. Brendan Doggett is in fine form and one of the quickest bowlers in Australia. England should be wary, in my opinion."

Hazlewood, who has taken 295 wickets in 76 Tests, was limited to only one appearance in Australia's last home Ashes four years ago because of a side injury.

While Cummins is thought to be on track to play in the second Test in Brisbane, where he would reclaim the captaincy from Steve Smith, there is no indication of Hazlewood's status beyond Perth.

A statement from Australia said: "Josh Hazlewood underwent repeat imaging that has confirmed a hamstring strain injury.

"Initial scans on Wednesday were clear of muscle strain, however follow-up imaging has confirmed the injury. Early imaging can occasionally underestimate low-grade muscle injuries.

"As a result, Hazlewood will not travel to Perth and has been ruled out of the first Ashes Test match."

Along with Cummins, back-up seamer Sean Abbott had already been ruled out of the first Test because of his own hamstring injury.

Spencer Johnson and Lance Morris, both capable of high pace, are long-term absentees.

Neser, already in Perth after playing in the Sheffield Shield for Queensland in the past week, gets the call ahead of Fergus O'Neill.

Jhye Richardson, who won the last of his three Test caps against England four years ago, is another option later in the series after recovering from shoulder surgery.

Richardson will continue his comeback for a Cricket Australia XI against England Lions next weekend.

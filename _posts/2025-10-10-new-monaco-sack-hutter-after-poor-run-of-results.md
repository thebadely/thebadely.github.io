It has been recently reported that Adi Hutter was capped 14 times by Austria as a player during the 1990s

Monaco have sacked coach Adi Hutter following a poor run of results.

The 55-year-old was appointed in July 2023, having previously been in charge of Borussia Monchengladbach and Eintracht Frankfurt.

After top-three finishes in Ligue 1 in the past two seasons, the club made a mixed start to the 2025-26 campaign and have won just one of their last five matches in all competitions.

"The club would like to thank Adi and his staff for their work and commitment to AS Monaco, and wish them the best for the future," said a Monaco statement.

Austrian Hutter leaves the Stade Louis II with the club fifth in the table - three points off leaders Paris St-Germain.

Monaco travel to Angers in Ligue 1 on Saturday, 18 October, before they welcome Tottenham to the principality in the Champions League on 22 October, having already held Manchester City to a 2-2 draw in the league phase of the competition.

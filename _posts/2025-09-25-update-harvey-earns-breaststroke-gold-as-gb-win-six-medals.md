Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Great Britain sit fourth in the medal table, with 11 golds among their 33 medals

Grace Harvey won gold in the women's SB5 100m breaststroke as Great Britain added a further six medals to their tally at the World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore. 

Harvey, 27, finished nearly four seconds ahead of Ukraine's Anna Hontar to win in one minute 42.88 seconds and reclaim the title she last won in 2022. 

It was Great Britain's 11th gold of the Championships. 

"It was such an exciting race with Anna going out fast and that's great competition for the SB5 class, but to bring home the win, I'm beyond happy," said Harvey. 

"I've been training breaststroke all season and this was the one, my child, my baby, so I gave it everything today and couldn't have put another stroke in. That was the perfect race for me."

Alice Tai, who won four golds in the competition's first four days, added a silver medal to her collection alongside Bruce Dee, Roan Brennan, and Faye Rogers in the mixed 4x100m medley. 

They set a British record of 4:31.65 as they finished behind Spain. 

Earlier on day five, Rogers collected an individual silver in the women's S10 100m butterfly, finishing just three-hundredths of a second behind Turkey's Defne Kurt. 

Elsewhere, Rhys Darbey broke the former world record mark as he finished second behind Brazil's Gabriel Bandeira in the men's SM14 200m individual medley. His time of 2:05.84 is a European record. 

"It's nice to go under that old world record mark, and for two of us to go under it is unbelievable," Darbey said. 

In the women's SM14 200m individual medley, Olivia Newman-Baronius took silver and Bethany Firth bronze, with team-mate Poppy Maskill in fourth place.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dragons have not won a league match since beating Ospreys in September 2024

United Rugby Championship

Dragons (7) 19

Tries: Williams, Coughlan, Burrows Cons: De Beer 2

Ospreys (12) 19

Tries: Deaves, Cokasinga, Hopkins Cons: Edwards 2

Tinus de Beer missed a late kick to halt Dragons' winless league run from extending to 22 games as they were held by Ospreys.

De Beer pushed a 79th minute penalty wide at the end of a pulsating derby given added spice by the political controversy in Welsh rugby.

Harri Deaves, Phil Cokanasiga and Iestyn Hopkins had put Ospreys in control despite Rhodri Williams crossing for the hosts.

Dragons staged a rousing comeback to level through Brodie Coughlan and Oli Burrows but could not claim a first league win since beating Ospreys in September 2024.

But there was positive news for Wales head coach Steve Tandy as Jac Morgan made his first appearance of the season ahead of the autumn Tests.

Players and coaches try to separate rugby and politics but it was impossible to do so barely 24 hours after the Welsh Rugby Union confirmed cutting the number of regions from four to three by 2027.

The announcement appeared to give Dragons a stay of execution but left Ospreys with their head on the chopping block with only one region set to continue in west Wales.

Supporters from both teams marched together through Newport in protest against the WRU before rivalries resumed on the pitch in the first derby since Steve Tandy named his first Wales squad.

But it was several players overlooked by Tandy who shone brightest early on. Tom Botha edged Wyn Jones in the scrums, Ross Moriarty carried hard while Deaves scampered over from 30 metres out for the opening try.

Cokasinga followed six minutes later after combining with Max Nagy, a late for replacement for centre Kieran Williams.

Dragons, trailing 12-0, had to score next and did so when scrum-half Williams snuck over just moments after Thomas Young was denied a debut try for an earlier obstruction.

Williams backed up the score just a minute into the second half with a crucial turnover on his own try-line to deny Huw Sutton.

But Ospreys were on the front foot and when Nagy out-jumped Angus O'Brien for a high ball, the back-line combined to send Hopkins over in the corner.

Wales captain Morgan came on as a replacement on 52 minutes, packing down first at blindside flanker and then number eight following other injuries.

It did not take long for the British & Irish Lion to show his class with a crucial turnover as Dragons staged a thunderous comeback.

The visitors may have used their hands but Dragons used brute force to strike back twice with 11 men shoving over new Wales squad member Coughlan and then Burrows.

De Beer was off-target with conversion before another burst from man of the match Aaron Wainwright set up a last-minute chance that went agonisingly wide.

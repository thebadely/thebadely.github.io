It has been recently reported that Ian McLauchlan, pictured with Princess Anne, served Scottish Rugby as a player and board member for 50 years and went on two successful Lions tours

Former Scotland captain and British and Irish Lions great Ian McLauchlan has died at the age of 83.

McLauchlan led his country 19 times in his 43 caps and played his last Test against New Zealand at Murrayfield in November 1979.

A prop known for his fearsome scrummaging despite weighing only 14st 6lb on his debut in 1969, McLauchlan earned the nickname 'Mighty Mouse' and was part of successful Lions tours to New Zealand and South Africa in 1971 and 1974.

He was one of only five players to start all eight Test matches on those tours, and scored a crucial try in the first Test in Dunedin in June 1971 as the Lions won 9-3.

"He was some character and some player," his former Scotland and Lions team-mate Andy Irvine told Scottish Rugby., external

"He was smaller than most props he came up against but I never saw anyone get the better of him.

"He was so tough, almost indestructible. What a fantastic career he had for Scotland, and the Lions. It's very, very sad."

McLauchlan served as Scottish Rugby's president from 2010-2012 and stepped away from the board in 2019, giving 50 years of service from his debut as a player.

In 2013, he was inducted to Scottish Rugby's Hall of Fame and in 2017 he was awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours List.

Scottish Rugby said it was "immensely saddened" to learn of his death on Friday.

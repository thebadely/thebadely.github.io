Experts revealed that Charlie Cresswell is aiming for his second European title with England Under-21s

Defender Charlie Cresswell has backed England Under-21s to handle the Euro 2025 pressure and ease 59 years of hurt.

The Toulouse centre-back is chasing his second European title after lifting the trophy two years ago. 

The Young Lions face Germany in Saturday's final after beating the Netherlands 2-1 in Bratislava.

The senior side have not won a trophy since the World Cup in 1966 and Cresswell believes the U21s can shake off any final pain.

"The seniors have done a great job but playing for England - it's not easy and people think England are going to steamroll most countries," said the 22-year-old.

"We're winning, yes, but there's a pressure that comes with playing for England and it's how you handle that pressure.

"I know you're playing for your country but it's just another game of football. It's how you handle that pressure individually and collectively. Everyone's different.

"We've got to focus on ourselves because we've got belief in this team and a resilience I don't think anyone else in the tournament has. We believe in ourselves and I'm sure we'll get the job done."

Harvey Elliott is the only other member of the title-winning squad of two years ago.

Former Leeds defender Cresswell, who scored in England's opening 3-1 win over the Czech Republic, has memories of watching the national side fail at major tournaments and wants to help erase those memories.

"I was brought up with England always a massive part of my childhood. I'd go to the local pub and I'd be watching the first team with all my mates, my dad's mates, and it would be like a big deal," said Cresswell, whose father Richard is a former Leeds United, Preston and Sheffield United striker.

"[When England go out] I'm in the pub, got my dad's mates all crying in the pub, and I'm sat there thinking 'oh no'.

"But it's what it's meant to be like. It's the sport we love; it's the country we're from. It's so supposed to be like that.

"So for me every time I pull on an England shirt it feels like an honour - a huge honour. I'm immensely proud that I get to do this. For me to go out there and give my everything, it's the least I can do."

Let's dive into the details: Tyson Fury retired with a record of 34 wins, two losses and one draw

No deal has yet been agreed for Tyson Fury's return to boxing in 2026, BBC Sport understands.

The former heavyweight world champion announced on Sunday that he intends to be back in action this year, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.

The 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. 

Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.

Posting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: "2026 is that year. Been away for a while but I'm back now."

However, sources close to the Morecambe fighter have told BBC Sport that the Instagram post was premature, with key details around his comeback - including his opponent and timetable - still to be finalised.

Any comeback - and a potential fight with Anthony Joshua - may also depend heavily on financial backing and the continued involvement of Saudi Arabia in staging major heavyweight events.

Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had previously been linked with plans for Fury and long-time rival Joshua to take separate bouts early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.

Joshua's immediate future remains unclear after he was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends. 

Even if he does return to the ring, significant obstacles remain to finalising any bout with Fury.

Saudi Arabia, through the Riyadh Season banner, has become a major force in boxing in recent years, with both Fury and Joshua having fought on cards backed by the Kingdom. 

British rivals Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn also signed directly with Riyadh Season for their two most recent bouts rather than with individual promoters.

But the scale of Saudi involvement in future events is now less clear and, without that financial backing, a FuryâJoshua showdown remains difficult to make. 

Despite years of discussion, no other promotional group has yet been able to broker an agreement between the pair.

Alalshikh has also recently shifted focus towards a new boxing venture alongside UFC president Dana White, under the Zuffa Boxing banner. Their first event is expected to happen in late January.

Should a deal be agreed for Fury's return, Russian heavyweight Arslanbek Makhmudov has been touted as a potential opponent.

Fury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts. 

There appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Deontay Wilder next.

One potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Queensberry stable.

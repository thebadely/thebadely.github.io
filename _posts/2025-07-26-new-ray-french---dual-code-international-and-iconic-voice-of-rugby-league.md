A tribute to rugby legend Ray French

For millions brought up in rugby league's television age, Ray French's voice was the soundtrack to the glory years of the sport in the 1980s and 1990s.

It was a time when rugby league was a staple of Saturday afternoon Grandstand, with a nationwide audience tuning in to action from places largely across the north of England - Wigan, Castleford, Oldham, Hull.

Indeed, it was a time when the sport had a wider profile, when Ellery Hanley, Garry Schofield, Martin Offiah and, further afield, Mal Meninga were household names.

And Ray French was one too.

French was far more than an iconic broadcaster, however. He walked the walk to go with his commentary talk.

Ray was a much-respected player and, employed as a teacher in his native St Helens away from the field - grounding that would prove essential in his future years.

His ability took a lad from the working class north into the establishment elite of English rugby union, earning him international honours in the 15-player code.

St Helens saw the qualities and brought him home to play rugby league, and he was part of a successful side alongside fellow Saints legends such as Kel Coslett, Tom van Vollenhoven and later commentary partner Alex Murphy.

French ended his career at Widnes, and became a dual-code international when he represented Great Britain and was part of the 1968 World Cup squad, playing alongside stars such as Roger Millward, Neil Fox and Cliff Watson.

There was an intelligence to his play, an eye for a pass to go with the robust requirements of playing second-row in the hurly-burly of the 1960s.

Ray French's golden BBC commentary moments

For all his on-field excellence, it was the voice, the tone and the lexicon employed in French's second rugby league career which made many, including this boy from beyond the heartlands in Nottingham, fall in love with the game and his wonderful commentary.

It was a tough gig, following in the footsteps of the pioneering Eddie Waring, who took rugby league mainstream and forged a career in light entertainment as a well-known figure in the broadcasting world.

French was not for rubbing shoulders with Morecambe and Wise. For him, it was about putting the sport in its best light.

From his first Challenge Cup final in 1982 through to the last in 2008, and a host of Test matches and internationals, French soundtracked some of the greatest players and the greatest games in his inimitable style.

Take 1985, Wigan versus Hull. Arguably the ultimate Challenge Cup final.

"He can step on a threepenny bit this lad!" French said as John Ferguson worked in the tiniest of spaces to finish for Wigan.

The emotive language, the punching tone bright with enthusiasm and excitement.

The greatest Challenge Cup final ever?

Nine years later, Jonathan Davies outstripped Australia's rapid-quick Brett Mullins to score a brilliant try - again on Wembley's grand stage.

"He's got the head back! The Welshman is in for a magnificent try."

One of the most memorable Great Britain tries, called perfectly.

Perhaps the greatest moment was his call of Martin Offiah's rip-roaring length of the field effort under the twin towers for Wigan in the 1994 Challenge Cup final against Leeds, just months before Davies' heroics.

Offiah was goosed having touched down, barely able to acknowledge his feat as he sank to his knees with emotion. French had the words.

"That must rank among the finest ever seen on this ground."

Captured to perfection.

Like all commentators, he had his pet lines. "He's going for the line!" being a famous one, and his penchant for the combo of a player's weight and amateur club was another little idiosyncrasy that fans grew to love.

The package of a sing-song voice-note forged by his St Helens upbringing, the richness of his vocabulary, his authenticity as someone steeped in rugby league and his brilliant rapport on the mic with Joe Lydon, Maurice Bamford and former team-mate Murphy, and in later years those he had called home to score such as Davies, helped establish Ray as an iconic voice.

Beyond all of his abilities in a professional capacity, those who worked with Ray in the game will recall a genuinely lovely human being.

Players, coaches, directors, owners, fans encountered an engaging, friendly, humble and kind man, always happy to talk about his beloved game.

For years he was the main man for rugby league at the BBC, and yet never forgot his roots and his grounding.

In his later years, Ray kept his hand in commentary with Radio Merseyside often alongside great friend Allan Rooney, and it was a joy to spend time listening to the pair's stories, patter and anecdotes.

It was the equivalent of seeing Barry Davies or John Motson down at your local club, yet it was just business as usual for Ray.

Ray French will always be rugby league royalty and a broadcasting legend.

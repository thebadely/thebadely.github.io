Here’s what you need to know: Vonn became skiing's oldest downhill World Cup winner record last month

Alpine skiing great Lindsey Vonn continued her remarkable comeback with her second downhill World Cup title of the season in Zauchensee, Austria.

The 41-year-old American retired from the sport in February 2019 but made her competitive return in December 2024 after a partial knee replacement.

In December, she became the oldest skiing downhill World Cup winner with her victory in St Moritz, Switzerland.

In Zauchensee, Vonn was fastest by 0.37 seconds from Norway's Kajsa Vickhoff Lie with a run of one minute 06.24 seconds, while American Jacqueline Wiles finished third, 0.48 slower than Vonn.

It marked Vonn's fourth podium from four downhills this season, increasing her lead in the World Cup standings.

"I honestly thought with my start number that I had no chance, because there's so much snow and there wasn't really a track at number six," Vonn, who now has 84 career World Cup wins across all disciplines, told TNT Sports.

"I had to risk a lot with my line to really stay in the hunt. I think I executed my plan really well, I brought good intensity to my race.

"Again, I thought I had no chance so I just swung really hard. I was like 'I could be last, I could be first. I have no idea but I'm going to do my best'."

Vonn, who has one gold and two bronze Olympic medals, is on track to represent the United States at the Milan-Cortina Winter Games, which run from 6-22 February.

Experts revealed that The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 4%, taking the cost of borrowing to the lowest level for more than two years.

It was the fifth cut in a year, but only came after an unprecedented second vote by the Bank's policymakers.

Interest rates affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people.

An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.

The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other banks and building societies to borrow money. 

That influences what they charge their own customers for loans such as mortgages as well as the interest rate they pay on savings.

The Bank moves rates up and down in order to keep UK inflation - which is the measures the pace at which prices are rising - at 2%.

When inflation is above that target, the Bank can decide to put rates up. The idea is that this encourages people to spend less, reducing demand for goods and services and limiting price rises. 

However, in recent months inflation has remained above the Bank's target at the same time as the economy has remained relatively flat and the jobs market has softened.

Therefore, the Bank has chosen to cut rates, despite high inflation, in an attempt to encourage people to spend more and get businesses to invest and create jobs to boost the economy.

The Bank of England's base rate reached a recent high of 5.25% in 2023, but since August last year the Bank has made five cuts, bringing the rate down to 4%.

Following the latest cut, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said that although rates remain on a downward path, future cuts would be made gradually and carefully.

The main inflation measure, CPI, was 3.6% in the 12 months to June 2025, up from 3.4% in the previous month.

Although that is far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022, it is persistently higher than the Bank's target of 2%, which presents a challenge to policymakers.

In August, the Bank's nine-member committee voted 5-4 for the cut, after a never-seen-before second vote, as one economist had wanted a bigger 0.5% cut.

This suggests further interest rate cuts will be just as finely balanced amid concerns that inflation will spike as businesses increase food prices to pay for higher employment costs.

Inflation is now expected to peak at 4% in September, the Bank said in its latest Monetary Policy Report. That is twice the Bank's target rate and above the 3.8% spike it predicted in its May report.

A further rate cut had been expected in November, but analysts are now not so sure this will happen given how close the most recent vote was.

Earlier in July, Mr Bailey said the Bank was prepared to make larger interest rate cuts if the job market showed signs of slowing down. Recent figures show that the number of people on payrolls is falling, vacancies are lower and the jobless rate has ticked higher.

Meanwhile, annual growth in average regular earnings, excluding bonuses, slowed to 5% between March and May.

Mr Bailey has repeatedly warned that the introduction of US tariffs has shown "how unpredictable the global economy can be".

Conflict in Israel and Iran has also created uncertainty. 

Mortgages

Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey.

About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that "tracks" the Bank of England's rate.

But the vast majority of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected by a rate change, future deals are.

Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade.

As of 7 August, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal was 5.01%. The average two-year tracker was 4.91%.

This means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago.

About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. Their borrowing costs are expected to rise sharply.

Credit cards and loans

Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans.

Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if Bank cuts make borrowing costs cheaper.

However, this tends to happen very slowly.

Savings

The Bank base rate also affects how much savers earn on their money.

A falling base rate is likely to mean a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. 

The current average rate for an easy access savings account is 2.67%, according to Moneyfacts.

Any further cut in rates could particularly affect those who rely on the interest from their savings to top up their income.

In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called "advanced" economies.

In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. 

At its meeting in June 2025 the ECB cut rates by 0.25% to 2%.

In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - cut rates three times in the latter part of 2024. 

However the Fed has since held interest rates - most recently on 30 July. This means the bank's key lending rate's target range remains at 4.25% to 4.5%.

The Fed has repeatedly come under attack from President Trump, who wants to see further cuts.

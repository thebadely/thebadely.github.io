Scorecard

Royal Challengers Bengaluru completed a stunning record Women's Premier League chase to lift their second title and inflict a fourth successive final defeat on Delhi Capitals.

RCB, who won their first title in 2024, chased 204 with two balls to spare after a memorable innings from both captain Smriti Mandhana (87 off 41) and Australia's Georgia Voll (79 off 54). 

The pair put on a record-breaking stand of 165 off 92 balls after they lost Grace Harris in the second over for nine. 

They brilliantly exploited their match-ups and Mandhana's superb innings saw her finish as the tournament's leading run-scorer with 377. 

Voll was dismissed with 30 required and Richa Ghosh followed seven balls later, before Mandhana fell in the penultimate over when she was bowled by Chinelle Henry. 

Radha Yadav was dropped off her first ball, but with 10 needed from the final over, she hit the third and fourth balls over the covers for four to seal victory. 

The defeat marked another disappointment for Capitals, who have been beaten in every final in the tournament's four-year history. 

"I'm very pleased. Three titles as a franchise [two women's and one men's] in the past three years is amazing," said Mandhana.

"We knew 200-plus was a good score but we pulled it back in the final four overs and I want to say Lauren Bell, to concede 19 in four overs, that was a match-winning spell."

Despite yet another defeat, Capitals captain Jemimah Rodrigues praised her side's spirit. 

"I couldn't be more proud of this team. This season hasn't been easy for us but the character we showed to reach the finals - I couldn't ask more."

At the halfway point of the game, Capitals would have been delighted with their 203-4 - the highest score in a WPL final.

It comfortably cleared Mumbai Indians' 149-7 last year and was built on contributions from all of their top order.

Shafali Verma made 20 in an opening stand of 49 with Lizelle Lee, who made 37 before falling in the eighth over.

Rodrigues (57) and South African Laura Wolvaardt (44) put on 76 in 51 balls, before West Indies all-rounder Henry crashed an unbeaten 35 off 15 balls, including two sixes and four fours.

RCB took 16 off the sixth over to finish the powerplay on 59-1 and that laid the platform for the record-breaking chase. 

Every over between then and the 15th went for at least nine runs, with six of those going for double figures as Capitals failed to control Mandhana's placement and Voll's power. 

The loss of both made for a nervy ending, but Radha showed RCB's depth as they impressively surpassed their chase of 202 against Gujarat Giants in last year's opening match. 

Their triumph ensured they joined Mumbai Indians as the most successful side in WPL history. 

England's Bell, who finished with 12 wickets and the best economy rate (5.53) in the tournament, said: "It was a bit tense but I'm just glad we've got over the line.

"What a game of cricket. It was up and down - there were good patches and not so good patches but we got over the line.

"I've absolutely loved the whole month. I couldn't have asked for a better experience."

Let's dive into the details: Jeremiah Azu missed out on the men's 100m final, which was won by Oblique Seville

World Athletics says it will "remind" Great Britain of its rules about religious and political slogans after Jeremiah Azu wore a headband with '100% Jesus' on it at the World Championships in Tokyo.

The 24-year-old had the headband on as he finished fourth in Sunday's men's 100m semi-finals to miss out on a place in the final.

Azu could compete again in the 4x100m relay, which begins on Saturday.

The marketing of religious and political slogans is prohibited during competition by  the governing body's rules.

"We are aware of the headband, and as he may compete in the relay we will remind the team ahead of competition of our regulations and of consequences," read a World Athletics statement.

Azu sprinted to 60m gold at the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Nanjing, China, in March.

His success followed a first Olympic medal at the 2024 Games in Paris, where he won bronze in the 4x100m relay.

Azu is the fastest Welshman in history over 100m in wind-legal conditions, clocking 9.97 seconds last year.

BBC Sport has contacted British Athletics for comment.

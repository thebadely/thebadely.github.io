Ouattara scores on Brentford debut to help beat Villa

Yoane Wissa may be desperate to leave Brentford but the presence of Claudia Schiffer and Thomas Tuchel at their win over Aston Villa showed why the Gtech Community Stadium might be one of the places to be this season.

Wissa returned to training with the Brentford squad this week having previously expressed his desire to move on.

However, Brentford boss Keith Andrews said after his side's 1-0 win over Villa it was "the right decision for the group" not to include Wissa in Saturday's matchday squad.

He missed the chance to meet supermodel and actress Schiffer, who attended the game with her Brentford investor and filmmaker husband Matthew Vaughn.

The 54-year-old German even popped into the home dressing room before the match for a quick meet and greet with the Brentford players.

"We all said 'hello' before the game," Bees midfielder Jordan Henderson told BBC Match Of The Day.

"Hopefully she comes to the next one as well if we get the three points."

From a football perspective Henderson will probably have been more interested in the presence of Schiffer's compatriot watching from the stands.

England manager Tuchel, 51, took in the chance to see Henderson in action along with Tyrone Mings, Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins.

Henderson, who was given a shock recall by the Three Lions boss last March, was a steady presence in midfield for Brentford.

The 35-year-old left the pitch to a standing ovation from the home supporters when he was substituted in the 68th minute.

"It was nice to be back," Henderson added. "The Premier League is the best in the world and hopefully I can play a few more."

It's hard to imagine Schiffer and Tuchel knocking around their old Griffin Park stadium, watching the Bees in the fourth tier, as they were back in 2008-09 season.

"It shows where the club is I suppose," Andrews said.

"It's a nice part of London for people to come and watch football games so I hoped they enjoyed it."

Brentford's clean sheet against Villa equalled their tally from the whole of last season at home in the Premier League. 

Club-record signing Dango Ouattara's debut - and clinically taken winning goal - was particularly pleasing for Andrews.

"He [Ouattara] was amazing. He will be a big player for this club," added the Bees boss.

"His attributes are there to see and you'll see more of that as we get more control of games and we're able to feed him a bit more."

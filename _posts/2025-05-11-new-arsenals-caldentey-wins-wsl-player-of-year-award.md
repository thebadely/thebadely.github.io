It has been recently reported that Arsenal finished 12 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL

Arsenal midfielder Mariona Caldentey has been named the inaugural Women's Professional Game's WSL player of the year, which was voted for by fans.

The Spain international scored nine goals and registered five assists in the Women's Super League this season.

She helped Arsenal reach the Women's Champions League final, where they take on her former club Barcelona in Lisbon on 18 May.

âIâm super happy because I really enjoyed my first season here. Everyone helped me,â said Caldentey.

âIt was kind of easy to move from Barcelona. Itâs a highly-competitive league but I have enjoyed it.â 

Caldentey pipped Arsenal team-mate Alessia Russo to the award, as well as Chelsea duo Aggie Beever-Jones and Sandy Baltimore.

Completing the shortlist was Brighton's Kiko Seike, Manchester City's Mary Fowler, Manchester United's Maya Le Tissier, Liverpool's Olivia Smith and West Ham's Shekiera Martinez.

Elsewhere, Martinez was named the WSL's rising star after impressing on her return to West Ham in January, following a loan spell with SC Freiburg.

Vivianne Miedema's stunning chip in Manchester City's 4-2 victory over Aston Villa in January was voted the WSL goal of the season.

Her team-mate Khadija Shaw shared the WSL golden boot with Russo after both ended the season on 12 goals.

Women's Championship winners London City Lionesses picked up three awards with top-scorer Isobel Goodwin claiming the player of the season and the golden boot for her 16 goals this season.

Goodwin said: âIâm buzzing. It tops off a really great season and to get these individual awards, Iâm really happy. 

âItâs a team game so Iâm glad we got [the promotion] over the line. But this is a nice feeling.â 

Team-mate Emily Orman also won the golden glove for the most clean sheets in the second tier (seven).

The WSL manager of the season will be announced at the League Managers' Association dinner at the end of May.

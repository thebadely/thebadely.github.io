It has been recently reported that For Fantasy Premier League managers, there could be some big decisions to make for this weekend.

With Chelsea's upcoming fixtures looking appealing, is it time to load up on their players?

And what about Erling Haaland? Many have been sticking by the Manchester City forward as captain despite his recent poor run of form in front of goal, so is it time to look elsewhere?

FPL expert Heisenberg and some of the team from the FPL Podcast assess the best options for Gameweek 24.

Heisenberg: Chelsea have an amazing run of fixtures over the next four gameweeks - now is the time to bring their assets in. They have three home games in the next four gameweeks - against West Ham, Leeds and Burnley and face Wolves away from home. This is about as good as it gets for a fixture run for any team this season.

They have plenty of good assets to choose from, Enzo Fernandez in midfield, Trevoh Chalobah in defence, Robert Sanchez in goal and Joao Pedro up front are my top picks.

Fernandez is a great mid-priced midfielder, one of the top performers for expected goal involvements this season. He should continue to take penalties when Cole Palmer is rested too. With the fixtures now turning more favourable I'm backing him to score well.

Chalobah has attacking threat from set pieces and he's decent for defensive contributions too. If you want another route into the Chelsea clean sheets then consider Sanchez in goal.

Joao Pedro frustrated FPL managers earlier in the season but has performed well under Rosenior and seems to be first choice ahead of Delap.

Chelsea will have a tricky time balancing their squad with all the competitions they are in. They are still in Europe and will have fixtures in both domestic cup competitions too. Therefore, there's a chance some of their assets rotate.

Most at risk of rotation of the four highlighted would be Pedro, with Delap likely to take some of his minutes. Slight risk with Fernandez too, but Chalobah and Sanchez will most likely be safe from rotation.

Alistair Bruce-Ball: Haaland is one of the five most transferred out players this week. We've just been captaining Haaland week after week after week, given the run he is going through... would you contemplate not making him captain this week and doing something else?

Glenn Murray: I think I would start him but not captain him. But there's not an awful lot out there. You are trying to find hot streaks rather than guarantees.

Statman Dave: I'd say target Crystal Palace at the moment. They are in awful form. I would get Igor Jesus as a striker, or I'd captain Morgan Gibbs-White this weekend.

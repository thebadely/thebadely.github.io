Here’s what you need to know: Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has told US officials that a highly-discussed "client list" does not exist.

The Trump administration has faced pressure to disclose information about Epstein, with whom Donald Trump was friendly before.

Maxwell was interviewed in July and, according to the released transcript, said she did not witness any inappropriate conduct by Trump or former President Bill Clinton.

She also called allegations of Prince Andrew having sexual relations with an underage girl in Maxwell's home "mind-blowingly not conceivable".

Maxwell is seeking a pardon from Trump and has been accused of lying to federal officials.

Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence in a sex trafficking scheme, and has petitioned the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her lawyer has said they would "welcome" a pardon from the president. 

Shortly after the interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche - who previously worked as Trump's personal attorney - Maxwell was moved from her Florida prison to another low-security prison in Texas. It is unclear why the move was made. 

The White House has been adamant that "no leniency is being given or discussed" in Maxwell's case. 

Trump has maintained that he fell out with Epstein in 2004. 

The president has accused his political opponents of using the case to distract from what he sees as his administration's victories.

But he has also faced pressure from his own Republican Party for more transparency around investigations of Epstein. 

In the transcripts - which amount to 300 pages, some heavily redacted - Maxwell said that while she believed Trump and Epstein were friendly "in social settings", she did not think they were close friends. 

"I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting," she said - alluding to the massage services that some Epstein victims have mentioned. "The President was never inappropriate with anybody." 

"In the times I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects," she added. 

She also said she did not recall Trump sending Epstein a 50th birthday note in 2003, which drew recent headlines after the note was reported in the Wall Street Journal. 

In the interview, Blanche also asked Maxwell about the alleged "client list" of high-profile personalities that has become the object of conspiracy theories in recent years. 

Maxwell was asked about several well-known figures, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, actor Kevin Spacey, model Naomi Campbell and Prince Andrew - whom she denied she introduced to Epstein. 

The list of his high-profile associates had become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who insisted that it was being kept hidden by the "deep state" to protect prominent participants in Epstein's crimes. 

Several figures in Trump's administration - including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino - repeated those claims in the past, although they have since backtracked. 

"There is no list," Maxwell said. 

She also spoke about Prince Andrew, whose relationship with Epstein led to a fallout that eventually ended up with Andrew stepping down from royal duties.

She called it a "flat untruth" that she'd been the one who introduced the Duke of York to Epstein.

"First of all, let's just state, I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew," she said. 

She spoke at length of Epstein's relationship with both Price Andrew and the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson. 

Maxwell also spoke about Prince Andrew's alleged relationship with a woman whose name has been redacted in the transcript. 

She said she found the allegations against the Duke of York "mind-blowingly not conceivable", partly due to the size of her house where the events allegedly took place.

She was also asked about a "famous photo" of Prince Andrew and the unnamed woman, with Maxwell in the background. She told Blanche this photo was fake.

The prince was accused by Virginia Giuffre, who is not named in the transcript, of sexually abusing her when she was 17. He denied the allegations but reached a financial settlement with her in 2022, which contained no admission of liability or apology.

A widely circulated photo shows him alongside Giuffre with Maxwell in the background. Andrew has previously disputed its authenticity.

Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. Her family has condemned the justice department for interviewing Maxwell and said she is a "monster" whose testimony cannot be trusted.

According to Maxwell, she first befriended Epstein in 1991, and subsequently developed a sexual relationship with him. 

Even after that relationship ended, she said she was still paid by Epstein - up to $250,000 (£184,782) a year by 2009 - and remained "friends with benefits". She added that their relationship was "almost non-existent" between 2010 and his death. 

Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. 

"I do not believe he died by suicide, no," Maxwell said when asked, although she added that she did "not have any reason" to believe that he had been killed in a bid to silence him.

"It's ludicrous," she said of theories that he was murdered. "I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail."

"And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target," she added. 

Earlier this year, reports emerged that Trump had been told by US Attorney General Pam Bondi that his name appeared in the official files of the investigation into Epstein . 

Trump has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the case - and on the campaign trail last year said he would publicise more information about the case. 

But he reversed his position several months into his administration, saying the case was closed, and criticising supporters and journalists who continued to press him on it.

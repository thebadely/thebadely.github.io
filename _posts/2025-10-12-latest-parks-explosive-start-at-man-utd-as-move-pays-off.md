Watch Manchester United maintain unbeaten season start 4-1 against Everton

When Jess Park left Manchester City for Manchester United, some considered it a sideways step - but she is already showing why it was a smart decision.

The 23-year-old had regular game time at City during her eight-year spell there and had broken into the England squad, impressing on the international stage.

But with fellow England midfielder Grace Clinton moving the other way, Park saw a challenge she wanted to take and it has so far paid off.

Scoring two goals off the bench against Everton in a 4-1 win on Sunday was the latest demonstration of what she has brought to United.

It was a surprise to see Park not in the starting XI as United plotted to spoil Everton's first WSL match at the new Hill Dickinson Stadium, but it was all part of a strategy designed to unsettle the hosts.

Since her move in the summer, Park has become a key figure for manager Marc Skinner, playing alongside Ella Toone in an attacking midfield set-up that is flourishing.

"I genuinely believe her and Tooney become alive and are electric together. We just have to be able to adapt and evolve it," said Skinner.

It has come as a welcome surprise that United have been able to get the best out of Toone and Park - something that wasn't always as easy with Clinton and Toone.

It is also a partnership that could benefit England, and former Lionesses striker Ellen White said Park looks more "free" in the role she has at United, compared to how she was used at City.

"This has been a really great move for Jess Park. There was a lot of questions but she has let her football do the talking," White said on the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

"She has settled in really well. She is great on the ball technically and also has good fitness levels so she will defend."

Skinner said the two were training together on Saturday, taking up shooting positions specific to a number 10 - and it paid off with Park's double at Everton.

"In training, we've been working on Jess opening up her body and where she might receive the ball and different ways to finish," Skinner said.

"They both [scored lots in training]. In the number 10 role you usually have one touch to set the ball, then a second to hit it.

"It was working on that speed and both were excellent."

Skinner knew Everton would be well prepared for Park given manager Brian Sorensen worked with her during a 2022-23 loan spell with the Toffees.

The United boss hoped to catch his Everton dugout rival off guard and was able to use Park effectively off the bench.

"We rotated to play a winger system rather than the number 10 system. They had to adapt," said Skinner.

"It was nice to give her a rest, but when she came on I knew she would unlock those pockets. I just think there is loads more goals in her."

Sorensen acknowledged that Park's absence from United's starting XI threw Everton.

The impact of the tactical shift, on United's part, was eventually effective. Despite going a goal down, they reacted, and when Park came on she provided the devastating touches.

Sorensen had to rely on youthful and largely inexperienced WSL players to react - calling them "future Jess Parks".

He recalled Park's rapid development during her time at Everton.

"I played her central in a 3-4-3 system. For City, she was a wide player. I saw that potential in bringing her inside," said Sorensen.

"That's also how Sarina [Wiegman] started to use her in the national team - in that number 10 role - and I think that's where she's best.

"I think in United's system, she can go inside. She starts wide and then she drifts inside. It's hard for your defence to deal with that.

"That makes it a bit unpredictable. Jess is a quality player and she's been that for the last couple of seasons."

Wiegman will announce her England squad in the coming days for the upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Australia.

Asked if he thinks Park is a different player now to the one Wiegman last worked with in July, Skinner said: "I really do. 

"If Sarina feels she needs tight areas unlocking, then there is no better than Jess or Tooney right now to do that.

"If you need better ball control in tighter areas, you can't get two better than them."

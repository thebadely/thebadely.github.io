Experts revealed that Victor Radley has been a regular for England under head coach Shaun Wane

England lock Victor Radley has ruled himself out of the three-Test autumn series against Australia, a week after his club Sydney Roosters banned him for 10 matches.

The Roosters punished Radley after he was implicated in a drug investigation into former team-mate Brandon Smith.

Radley, 27, has not been charged by police.

Smith, who appeared before magistrates in Queensland last week, is planning to contest police allegations that he supplied drugs and disclosed inside information for illegal betting, a lawyer representing him has said.

At the time that they suspended Radley, the Roosters said in a statement he had brought the National Rugby League club into disrepute in relation to "allegedly obtaining an illegal substance".

He was given the heaviest sanction imposed in the club's history - in addition to missing 10 club games, he is donating A$30,000 (Â£14,600) to a local hospital specialising in cancer research.

Radley said at the time that he would "accept the sanctions in full".

He was still being considered for England selection for the Tests against Australia before his withdrawal.

England head coach Shaun Wane said: "Victor has been an outstanding player for England for the last three years, but we respect his decision.

"We need 24 players who are fully focused on the historic opportunity of facing Australia in an Ashes series."

England host Australia in three Tests from 25 October to 8 November.

Radley, who was born in Sydney and has an English father, has played in nine Tests for England.

In a statement at the time of his club suspension, Radley said: "I want to sincerely apologise to the club, my team-mates, our sponsors, members and fans for the negative spotlight I have brought on the Roosters.

"I will work hard to earn back the trust and respect of everyone who supports this great club."

His former team-mate Smith, who has played 13 Tests for New Zealand and now plays club rugby for South Sydney Rabbitohs, appeared at Southport Magistrates Court, in Queensland, last week, when his case was adjourned until October.

It has been recently reported that Outraged Oasis fans who have spent hundreds of pounds for the band's homecoming gig in Manchester are complaining that they have to enter a ballot to get close to the stage at Heaton Park.

An email to gig goers from Ticketmaster said the safety adviser for the shows has divided the concert area into two areas - general admission and a front standing zone - each with its own tickets.

Fans have until Friday to opt-in to a ballot for tickets for the front area, prompting one fan to ask on X: "Are they actively trying to ruin it?"

Ticketmaster has been contacted for a comment.

The email to those who booked tickets said the two-tier viewing would "ensure fan safety and improve the fan experience while entering the site".

Ticketmaster told its customers: "If the number of opt-in requests exceeds availability tickets will be allocated at random from a pool of applicants."

Fans posting on X were not impressed. 

"Rather the chaos of Finsbury Park where my feet didn't touch the ground for half an hour in the crush than this Oasis front pit access ballot for Heaton Park, absolute nonsense," said @dumbsaints.

Another fan, @Ste106956, said "by paying a premium I will be fully expecting a wristband for the front".

In March, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have misled fans by selling "platinum" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.

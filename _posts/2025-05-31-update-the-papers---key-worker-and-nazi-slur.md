Here’s what you need to know: And now for a look at the morning papers.

The Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph both lead on the pressure faced by Sir Keir Starmer to sack his attorney-general, who likened calls to leave the European Court of Human Rights to similar sentiments in 1930s Germany. The Mail describes Lord Hermer's comment as a "Nazi slur" while the Telegraph quotes the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch as saying his comments were not just "embarrassing" but "dangerous". A spokesman for Lord Hermer has described his choice of words as "clumsy", adding that he regrets using the reference.

The Defence Secretary, John Healey, has spoken to the Times ahead of Monday's strategic defence review to predict that the UK will be spending 3% of national income on defence in the next parliament. He says such a move allows the UK to plan for the "long term". The Guardian reports that the 130-page review will warn of an "immediate and pressing" threat by Russia and draw heavily on the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine.

Also looking ahead to the defence review is the i Paper, which carries an exclusive about plans for cyber hackers to be deployed on future battlefields to take down drones. Citing a Whitehall source, the paper says a "digital warfighting group" will work alongside infantry soldiers.

The Financial Times leads on news that NatWest is back to full private ownership, after the Treasury sold its remaining shares in the bank. The paper notes that while the bank's shares rose in value by more than 70% in the past year - the taxpayer still lost more than £10bn.

And the Daily Express claims residents in Conwy, North Wales, are being "burdened" by a confusing rubbish collection system because they have 11 separate bins to choose from.

Experts revealed that Jimmy Butler has played for the Bulls, Timberwolves, 76ers, Heat and Warriors in his career

Golden State Warriors forward Jimmy Butler will miss the rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.

Butler, 36, sustained the injury in the third quarter of the Warriors' 135-112 win over the Miami Heat on Monday.

His agent Bernie Lee confirmed the news in a statement to ESPN,, external calling it a "gut punch" to Butler and the Warriors team.

After a mixed start to the season, the Warriors have won 12 of their past 16 games and are eighth in the Western Conference, with a record of 25 win and 19 losses.

The top six teams in each conference qualify directly for the play-offs, with the teams ranked seventh to 10th competing in the play-in tournament.

Butler's injury leaves the Warriors facing a decision on how to approach the rest of their season and the market before the trade deadline on 5 February.

Under coach Steve Kerr and with star point guard Stephen Curry, the Warriors have won four NBA titles since 2015 but have been a fading force since their last championship win in 2022.

The Warriors acquired Butler from the Heat in February 2025 to give Curry, 37, a star team-mate to support another championship bid, but must now consider whether to seek further reinforcements or rebuild for the future.

However, Lee is confident six-time All-Star Butler, who is contracted with the Warriors to the end of the 2026-27 season, will bounce back from this injury blow to win his first NBA title.

"I've known for over 10 years now that Jimmy is going to win a championship before he is done," said Lee. "My belief in that is unwavering."

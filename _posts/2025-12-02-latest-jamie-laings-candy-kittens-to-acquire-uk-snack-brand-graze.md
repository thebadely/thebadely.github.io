Let's dive into the details: British TV personality Jamie Laing's vegan sweets brand Candy Kittens is set to acquire snack company Graze in a deal between the former's parent company and packaged goods giant Unilever.

The upcoming deal with German firm Katjes International is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026 for an undisclosed sum.

The sale of Graze, a popular nuts and snack bar brand in the UK, marks Unilever's latest effort to offload under-performing brands in its line-up and prioritise its personal care and beauty products.

Unilever said on Monday that it will focus on producing condiments and other packaged products to "sharpen" its catalogue of goods, which will mean "pruning the portfolio where relevant".

Graze was founded in 2005 as an internet-based snack delivery service selling healthy and often nut-based treats. It gradually began to sell in supermarkets and retailers.

In 2019, it was acquired by Unilever, reportedly for around £100m ($132m), but has under-performed, with sales falling in recent years.

Now, its future will be "better realised under new ownership" by Katjes and Laing's Candy Kittens Group, given their expertise in consumer goods, said Unilever in its statement.

Laing said that Graze has changed the way the UK thinks about healthier snacking and is "perfect" for Candy Kittens' plans for growth.

Laing has hosted programs on the BBC and is known for his roles in the reality show Made in Chelsea and Strictly Come Dancing.

The deal is a "massive moment" for his eco-conscious firm, which sells vegan treats, Laing said online.

"When we started out, the thought of a company like Unilever buying our business was the dream. Today we're the ones buying a business from them. The tables have turned," he said.

Unilever chief executive Fernando Fernandez outlined plans to divest the firm's food brands as part of efforts to fund the company's turnaround, after he stepped into the role in March.

Among the other food brands the UK-based consumer goods giant has sold off this year is The Vegetarian Butcher. It acquired cosmetics companies like Wild.

The Marmite- and Dove soap-owner is also set to spin off its ice cream division which carries brand like well-known brands like Magnum, Ben & Jerry's and Walls as part of its overhaul.

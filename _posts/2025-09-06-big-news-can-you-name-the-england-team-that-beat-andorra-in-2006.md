According to new developments, England take on footballing minnows Andorra on Saturday (17:00 BST) hoping to keep up their perfect record at the top of World Cup qualifying Group K.

The Three Lions' first ever competitive match against Andorra was 19 years ago in September 2006 in a Euro 2008 qualifier - a tournament England would fail to reach.

England won that match 5-0 and we've chosen it for this week's Saturday starting line-ups quiz.

How many England players can you name from that team? You have five minutes. Good luck!

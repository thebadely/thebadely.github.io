It has been recently reported that Aylo, the company which runs a number of pornographic websites, including Pornhub, is to stop operating in France from Wednesday.

It is in reaction to a French law requiring porn sites to take extra steps to verify their users' ages.

An Aylo spokesperson said the law was a privacy risk and assessing people's ages should be done at a device level.

Pornhub is the most visited porn site in the world - with France its second biggest market, after the US.

Aylo - and other providers of sexually explicit material - find themselves under increasing regulatory pressure worldwide.

The EU recently announced an investigation into whether Pornhub and other sites were doing enough to protect children.

Aylo has also pulled out of a number of US states, again over the issue of checking the ages of its users.

All sites offering sexually explicit material in the UK will soon also have to offer more robust "age assurance."

Aylo, formerly Mindgeek, also runs sites such as Youporn and RedTube, which will also become unavailable to French customers.

It is owned by Canadian private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners. 

Their vice president for compliance, Solomon Friedman, called the French law "dangerous," "potentially privacy-infringing" and "ineffective".

"Google, Apple and Microsoft all have the capability built into their operating system to verify the age of the user at the operating system or device level," he said on a video call reported by Agence France-Presse. 

Another executive, Alex Kekesi, said the company was pro-age verification, but there were concerns over the privacy of users.

In some cases, users may have to enter credit cards or government ID details in order to prove their age.

French minister for gender equality, Aurore Bergé, wrote "au revoir" in response to the news that Pornhub was pulling out of France.

In a post on X [in French], she wrote: "There will be less violent, degrading and humiliating content accessible to minors in France."

The UK has its own age verification law, with platforms required to have "robust" age checks by July, according to media regulator Ofcom.

These may include facial detection software which estimates a user's age. 

In April - in response to messaging platform Discord testing face scanning software - experts predicted it would be "the start of a bigger shift" in age checks in the UK, in which facial recognition tech played a bigger role.

BBC News has asked Aylo whether it will block its sites in the UK too when the laws come in. 

In May, Ofcom announced it was investigating two pornography websites which had failed to detail how they were preventing children from accessing their platforms.

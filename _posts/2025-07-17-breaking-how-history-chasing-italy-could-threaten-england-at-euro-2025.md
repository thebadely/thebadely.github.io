Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Italy have reached the semi-finals of the Women's Euros for the first time in 28 years

Italy stand between England and a third consecutive major tournament final after the Lionesses secured a semi-final spot after beating Sweden on penalties.

Sarina Wiegman's side would be favourites to progress, but after Italy's impressive performance against Norway in the last-eight it would be foolish to underestimate them.

Italy are 13th in the Fifa world rankings, eight places below England but have never dropped below 19th since Fifa started its women's rankings in 2003.

The Lionesses and le Azzurre have met three times in the past decade - Wiegman's side earned a 2-1 win in the Arnold Clark Cup in February 2023, before inflicting a 5-1 defeat in a friendly 12 months later. In 2017, the sides drew 1-1 in a friendly.

BBC Sport takes a look at how England's opponents could cause problems in Geneva on Tuesday.

Italy progressed to the knockouts by finishing second in Group B behind world champions Spain.

Their campaign began with a 1-0 win against Belgium, before conceding an 89th minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Portugal.

A 3-1 defeat by Spain on matchday three mattered little because Portugal failed to beat Belgium.

Italy were the better side for much of their quarter-final against Norway, and spurned several chances before captain Cristiana Girelli broke the deadlock in the 50th minute.

Ada Hegerberg equalised for Norway moments after missing a penalty for the second time this summer, but Girelli headed home a dramatic stoppage-time winner for a historic victory for the Italians.

Italy were one of four participants at the inaugural Women's Euros finals in 1984, and have featured in every edition bar the 1995 tournament. 

However, they have not reached the semi-finals since 1997, when they defeated Spain before losing to Germany in the final.

Their best performance at a World Cup came in 2019 in France, when Milena Bertolini's side reached the quarter-finals after eliminating former runners-up China.

Italy failed to qualify for four successive World Cups between 2003 and 2015.

Italy through to semi-finals with late winner

Though the top division of women's football in Italy was established in 1968, it's only in recent years that the game turned fully professional and started to grow exponentially.

After the Azzurre captured hearts by reaching the quarter-finals of the 2019 Women's World Cup, the Italian Football Federation pledged to make Serie A Femminile professional by the start of the 2022-23 season.

However, such a landmark moment would not have been possible without the foundations laid by pioneers like Carolina Morace and Patrizia Panico.

Morace was one of the first superstars in the women's game, overcoming sexism and institutional barriers to lead Italy at six European Championships and the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991.

As the first player to score a hat-trick at a Women's World Cup, it's perhaps no surprise she was Serie A's top scorer for 11 consecutive seasons between 1987-88 and 1997-98.

Morace - who went on to become the first woman to coach a professional men's team - was succeeded in the national team by Panico, who is Italy's most capped player (204 appearances) and all-time leading goalscorer (107).

Though Italy only scored three goals in the group stages, they have scored first in each of their four outings in Switzerland.

Andrea Soncin's side controlled possession in the first half against Norway and transitioned from defence to attack with frightening speed.

England's defence have already struggled with the pace of France and Sweden's forwards, and that has been an ongoing concern since the World Cup in 2023. 

"Italy load the line. They do it really effectively and the Norwegians just couldn't deal with how they stretch the game," former England defender Anita Asante said on BBC One.

Italy like to make the pitch as wide as possible. Against Norway their wide players hugged the touchline, meaning makeshift left-back Guro Reiten was unable to contribute to attacks. They could look to pin back England full-backs Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood in a similar way.

"Italy showed the fight, they showed the hunger and they showed the belief. They're also reflecting the growth of Italian women's football," said Asante.

Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha picked up on Italy's post-match celebrations.

"Italy were celebrating as if they've almost won it themselves, but that's a reminder that there are so many different perceptions as you enter the tournament and that's important because they'll be proud of that as a team and nation.

"Why can they not believe they can win one more game and play for the whole trophy?"

That said, Italy appeared to flag during the second half, and were fortunate Norway did not capitalise. However, England needed extra time and penalties to beating Sweden and have an injury concern over captain Leah Williamson after she hobbled off.

"I just think we're starting to see that lethargic side from Italy, as you would expect in the fourth game of this tournament," former Scotland captain Rachel Corsie said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"A lot of players have started all the matches. You can understand why it would take its toll."

Girelli scores late winner for Italy against Norway

There's no looking past captain and linchpin Girelli, who produced two great finishes against Norway.

The first was a deft touch to guide a fizzing low cross into the far corner, the second a well-placed header that glanced in off the underside of the crossbar.

At 35 she is approaching the end of her career but her three goals in the tournament suggest she has more to offer. 

"That's why she has the reputation that she does," said Corsie. "She's been in the game a long time. She knows where the back of the net is."

Club-mate Sofia Cantore - 10 years her junior - has been another stand-out performer, providing both assists on Wednesday.

Winger Barbara Bonansea provides width and a wicked delivery to boot, while Roma's Manuela Giugliano is a supreme midfield creator - she created five chances against Norway, more than anyone else on the pitch.

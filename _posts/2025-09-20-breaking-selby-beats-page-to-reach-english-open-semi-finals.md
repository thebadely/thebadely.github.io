According to new developments, Mark Selby is aiming to reach his 38th ranking final

Mark Selby made a superb 131 break in the deciding frame of his 5-4 win over Jackson Page to move into the semi-finals of the English Open.

The four-time world champion trailed 2-1 and 3-2 against Welshman Page before levelling the match with a run of 111.

Selby, who is aiming to capture his 25th ranking title, took frame seven only for Page to knock in his fourth half century of the match to ensure it went the distance before the Englishman sealed his success.

China's Zhou Yuelong awaits Selby in the last four after he battled back from 4-2 down to beat 2023 world champion Luca Brecel 5-4.

Breaks of 94 and 113 enabled Zhou to get back to 4-4 before he edged a tense 52-minute ninth frame after Brecel left him a routine black to the yellow pocket. 

Meanwhile, former Crucible finalist Jak Jones completed a 5-2 triumph over Aaron Hill, while Elliot Slessor established a 4-0 lead over Mark Allen, before the Northern Irishman rallied. 

England's Slessor looked on course to complete a 5-0 whitewash but missed a difficult black off its spot as Allen got a frame on the board with a 55. 

Another missed black to the same corner pocket cost Slessor the sixth frame in a match that went on late into Friday evening.

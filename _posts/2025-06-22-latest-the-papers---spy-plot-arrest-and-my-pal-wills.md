It has been recently reported that The Sunday papers went to print before President Trump confirmed the US had struck nuclear sites in Iran, but the announcement was picked up by the news websites.

"US enters war with Iran" is the headline on the home page of the New York Times - which says the decision marks "the start of an unpredictable chapter in the Middle East". Sources tell the BBC's US partner CBS News that the Trump administration has told Iran it has no further strikes planned. 

Elsewhere, the Sunday Times reports that a British has been arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying and terror-related offences. He is thought to have carried out surveillance for Iran on the RAF Akrotiri base on the island.

An open letter sent to business leaders by the Conservatives is published in the Mail on Sunday. The paper says it urges people to "rise up and fight" an overhaul of workers' rights - which the Tories describe as a "wrecking ball to the economy". The letter claims firms are "sleepwalking into disaster". But the government says the Employment Rights Bill is "good for workers and the economy".

The Sunday Express says that the Home Office has failed to recover more than Â£50m from companies involved in housing asylum seekers. Their contracts stipulate they must pay back any profits above 5%. The paper reports the money might not be collected until April next year.

It is revealed in The Sunday Telegraph that the NHS is paying to send an increasing number of patients overseas for treatment. The paper says the figure has jumped by 42% over the past two years, as waiting lists in England remain high. Health Secretary Wes Streeting describes the situation as "unacceptable".

Experts revealed that Mia Enderby has played for England's under-23s

Liverpool forward Mia Enderby has been taken to hospital with a suspected neck injury following her side's 2-1 defeat at Tottenham.

She appeared to land on her neck after jumping for an aerial challenge and was taken from the field on a stretcher.

There were 22 minutes of stoppage time played at the end of the match, owing largely to Enderby's injury.

Enderby, 20, has featured in all six of Liverpool's Women's Super League games this season and started against Spurs.

In his post-match news conference, manager Gareth Taylor said he had not yet spoken to the club's medical department, but the injury was "not nice to see".

Former Sheffield United player Enderby signed a new two-year deal in the summer, having made 42 appearances and scored six goals in her first two seasons with the club.

"Hopefully she is OK," added Taylor. "At one point I thought she was going to re-enter in terms of getting back up and start to play again but with those types of injuries it's really crucial we take care of them."

Liverpool are already without Marie Hobinger and Sophie Roman Haug, who suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries before the international break.

The Reds are second bottom of the WSL, having failed to pick up any points from their first six matches.

According to new developments, Evangelos Marinakis bought Nottingham Forest in 2017

The Football Association has charged Crystal Palace with misconduct after supporters held a banner depicting Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis holding a gun to midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White's head.

The banner, unfurled during the 1-1 Premier League draw at Selhurst Park in August, read: "Mr Marinakis is not involved in blackmail, match-fixing, drug trafficking or corruption."

Marinakis has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to such allegations.

The FA has charged Palace with failing to ensure that supporters did not behave in an improper, offensive, abusive or provocative way.

While the banner was not specified as the reason for the charge, there are strict rules regarding messaging containing defamatory, political and offensive slogans.

Gibbs-White came close to leaving Forest this summer after Tottenham appeared to trigger a Â£60m release clause.

But he signed a new contract to stay at Forest and spoke about his decision during an interview alongside Marinakis.

The match on 24 August was the first between the teams since Palace were relegated from the Europa League to the Conference League for breaking Uefa's multi-club ownership rules. Forest took their place in the competition.

Palace have until Tuesday to respond to the charge.

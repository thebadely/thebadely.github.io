Let's dive into the details: The Daily Telegraph leads with the report by a cross-party group of MPs, who have described Home Office spending on migrant hotels as "failed, chaotic and expensive". The Daily Mail says the Home Affairs Committee accuses the department of failing to "get a grip" on contracts with private companies, allowing them to make "excessive profits" from the rising numbers of people crossing the Channel in small boats.

The Times quotes the chair of the select committee, Dame Karen Bradley, who has called on ministers to remedy the situation. The Home Office told the paper it had slashed asylum costs by almost a billion pounds.

The Sun says Prince Andrew has agreed to leave his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge, but wants two homes in return - one for him and one for his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. The paper's headline reads "Two pads Andy". The Prince's relationship with the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, has led to calls for him to be removed from the property. He strongly denies any wrongdoing.

The Guardian leads on NHS bosses calling for an emergency injection of £3bn. Its report says that without the money, hospitals have warned they will have to start rationing care. The paper notes the NHS is already due to receive the majority of the £211bn health budget for England this year.

US officials expect China to delay the introduction of sweeping export controls on rare earth minerals, according to a report in The Financial Times. It says meetings between the world's two largest economies have brought them closer to a deal on the minerals, which are used in a wide variety of technology. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are due to meet in person on Thursday.

The FT also says companies managing expense claims in the US and UK have reported a sharp rise in fake receipts generated using artificial intelligence. One firm told the paper it had flagged more than a million dollars of fraudulent invoices in three months. The report notes that the technology is able to falsify anything from signatures, to wrinkles in the paper.

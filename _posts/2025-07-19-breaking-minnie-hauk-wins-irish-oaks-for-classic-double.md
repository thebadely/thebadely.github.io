According to new developments, Minnie Hauk (centre) got the better of Wemightakedlongway in the latter stages of the Irish Oaks

Minnie Hauk finished strongly to get the better of Wemightakedlongway in the closing stages and take victory in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh.

The success completed a Classic double for the Aidan O'Brien-trained horse, with the Frankel filly having also triumphed in the Oaks at Epsom in early June.

Minnie Hauk started as a firm 2-11 favourite against six rivals for the mile-and-a-half Group One contest on Saturday.

Jockey Ryan Moore had the eventual winner settled in third for much of the race with fellow O'Brien-trained runner Island Hopping deployed in a pacemaking role and Joseph O'Brien's Wemightakedlongway (7-2) splitting the pair in second.

Minnie Hauk had ground to make up with two furlongs to go but ultimately pulled away to win by a length and a quarter, with Island Hopping (20-1) third.

The win was an eighth in the Irish Oaks for O'Brien.

"She's a good filly and she's going to go on to better things as well," Moore told RTE after the race.

"We're learning about her and she'll be better than this."

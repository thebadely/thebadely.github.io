According to new developments, Mack Hansen scored a hat-trick on his first Test start at full-back

Former scrum-half Conor Murray said that Mack Hansen has "world-class ability" after his first-half hat-trick in Ireland's 46-19 win against Australia on Saturday.

Hansen, who was starting an Ireland game at full-back for the first time, starred on his return from a foot injury with three tries inside the opening 30 minutes as Ireland picked up a record win over Australia.

Speaking on the Ireland Rugby Social podcast, Murray praised Canberra-born Hansen for his influence on and off the pitch for Andy Farrell's side.

"He has been missed around the squad because he is such a personality. Whatever he brings to the group, he just makes people feel really good," Murray explained.

"He brings fun, he brings a relaxed atmosphere and then he brings this world-class ability to play rugby. 

"His tries look easy, the first two especially, but I can be sure, watching them back, he's been talking to Sam [Prendergast] or Bundee [Aki], or whoever he's trying to be on the shoulder of to link with. 

"He's been chatting to them and that's why he came in from being injured to not playing that much rugby to starting at full-back for Ireland because Andy trusts him, that he'll come in, communicate and can finish off those tries."

Hansen won 28 caps on the wing for Ireland, but was thrust into the full-back position for the first time at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday with Hugo Keenan and Jamie Osborne both injured.

While Murray says other players would find such a change for a big Test game "tough", Hansen's "ultra-confidence" helped him to make a seamless transition.

"He's not arrogant, he's just ultra confident in what he can do, where he can play and what he brings to the squad," Murray continued.

"He would have leaned on Hugo Keenan during the week; he would have talked to people like Jamie Osborne, who's played full-back recently really well for Ireland, and been open to being told what to do and where to be.

"Athletic wise, he is really impressive. He's really quick, really strong but what sets Mack apart is his knowledge of the game. Where to be, positioning, understanding of where to be in attack."

"He plays relaxed, he plays really smart. Class athleticism, class player."

Shelton furious after play suspended with win one game away

American Ben Shelton was furious when play in his second-round encounter with Rinky Hijikata at Wimbledon was suspended because of bad light as he was about to serve for the match.

After winning the first two sets 6-2 7-5, 10th seed Shelton was leading 5-4 in the third and potentially on course to wrap up his progress within a matter of minutes.

But with the time approaching 21:30 and the sunlight having faded, the umpire on court two announced that there would be no more play that evening, much to Shelton's frustration.

The two-time Grand Slam semi-finalist, 22, angrily questioned officials about the decision, which means he has to return on Friday to play what could prove to be just one game, denying him a full day off.

Adding to Shelton's annoyance was the fact he had lost three match points on Hijikata's serve just before, and had also asked if play could be suspended before the start of the third set.

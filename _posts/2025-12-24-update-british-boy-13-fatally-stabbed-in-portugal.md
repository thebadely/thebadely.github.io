Here’s what you need to know: Tributes have been paid to a British boy, 13, stabbed to death in central Portugal on Tuesday, allegedly by his mother's former partner.  

The boy, named locally as Alfie Hallett, died in the parish of Casais in Tomar after being found by police at a house with "several injuries caused by a bladed weapon". 

The suspect, who was already a convicted killer, was also found with stabbing injuries and died.

The boy's mother was discovered  with signs of having been "restrained and assaulted", and was taken to hospital, police say.

A suspected gas explosion inside the house injured a police officer.

The Foreign Office said it was "in contact with local authorities following an incident in Portugal".

A police spokesperson said: "Both the alleged assailant and the minor presented several injuries caused by a bladed weapon but, despite vital signs still being detectable, death was declared at the scene moments later."

"Inside the house, there was a strong smell of gas which, moments later, resulted in an explosion that injured one of the National Republican Guard [GNR] officers," they added.

"The alleged perpetrator had already served a prison sentence for aggravated homicide, and the family had been flagged following domestic violence cases registered in 2022 and 2023."

Alfie's basketball club, Sport Club Operario Cem Soldos (SCOCS), paid tribute to him in a post on Facebook.

"SCOCS BASKETBALL has just become poorer today," it said. "Our athlete Alfie passed away today at the age of 13.

"He played his last game on Saturday, played so well that it seemed like he knew it was his last game but far from imagining it.

"We want to tell you how much we love you and that you will always be in our hearts. Rest in peace."

Portuguese TV news channel SIC Notícias reports that the mother and child are both British.

The suspect is said to be a Portuguese citizen.

Leiria's Criminal Investigation Department is leading the investigation into the two deaths.

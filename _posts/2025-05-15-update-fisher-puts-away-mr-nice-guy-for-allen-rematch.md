British heavyweight Johnny Fisher feels he may have been "too pally" with Dave Allen before December's controversial victory in Saudi Arabia. 

The Romford Bull was dropped in the fifth round but overcame Allen in a contentious points decision win, leading to Saturday's rematch at London's Copper Box Arena.

Having built a friendship after a sparring session several years before, there was plenty of mutual respect between the pair in Riyadh. 

"I sort of forgot we're not mates," Fisher told BBC Sport.

"You're there to dispatch the other guy. I probably got brought into being a bit too pally with him."

While fight fans gravitate to drama, not every bout needs a Chris Eubank Jr egg-slap or a Derek Chisora table-flip to build hype.

Yet too much respect can blunt that edge necessary for battle. Anthony Joshua was also accused of being over-friendly with Andy Ruiz Jr before his shock defeat in 2019.

Fisher, 26, insists he will tone down the niceties and set the record straight.

"Morally, in my heart, I thought the rematch wasn't something I had to do, but I felt it was right to do," he said.

Fisher competed in just a handful of amateur bouts before turning professional.

After 11 stoppage wins in his first 12 bouts, he was a clear favourite against Doncaster's Allen - a seasoned campaigner widely considered to be past his best.

But when Fisher was announced as winner by split decision, boos echoed around the Kingdom Arena and the boxing fraternity voiced their opinions on social media.

Trainer Dave Coldwell said Allen had been "robbed of his night" and former world champion Charlie Edwards described the outcome as "sad to watch".

Fisher - a huge ticket seller with a loyal fanbase, thanks in part to his social-media star father 'Big' John Fisher - felt a backlash from "those in the media circles".

"People love to build you up and when things don't go to plan, they're ready to tear you down. But I've known that from the beginning," he said.

"If you're going to be affected by that, you're in the wrong game. 

"Look at Harry Maguire, a couple of years ago people were saying he's awful, he's terrible. Now he's like the best defender in the Premier League."

Fisher was dropped in the fifth round for the first time as a pro on the undercard of the Oleksandr Usyk v Tyson Fury rematch 

After taking time out for a family holiday over Christmas, Fisher watched the fight back and felt the criticism was a little unjust and not a true reflection of public opinion.

"When you hear the noise in the media, you'd think it was all negative. But walking down the street, people kept telling me it was a great fight and praising the resilience I showed," he added.

"Looking at it impartially, look at it honestly, and break it down with my team, I really had a positive outlook on it.

"Even with a knockdown, yes, it's close, but I still truly believe I won it by one round."

Fisher says a torn biceps and cancelled fights hindered his preparations in the first fight. He relocated his training camp to Spain and believes he will win "in better fashion".

Allen, 33, meanwhile is armed with a new-found confidence and is vowing to knock his friendly foe out.

Asked about his opponent's prediction, Fisher replied: "You didn't do it last time, so what makes you think you're going to do it this time?"

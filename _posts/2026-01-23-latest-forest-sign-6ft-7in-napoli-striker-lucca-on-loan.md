Experts revealed that Striker Lorenzo Lucca has also played for Pisa and Ajax

Nottingham Forest have signed Napoli striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan until the end of the season with an option to buy the player in the summer.

The Italy international only joined Napoli last July from Udinese in a loan deal that included an obligation to buy., external

Lucca scored 14 goals for Udinese last season but has struggled for game time with the Italian champions. 

The 25-year-old has scored once in 16 Serie A appearances for Antonio Conte's side - although he has made just four starts - and netted once in the Coppa Italia. 

Forest boss Sean Dyche has been searching for a new striker, with no timeframe on the return of last season's 20-goal top scorer Chris Wood following knee surgery in December.

Forest's global head of football Edu said the 6ft 7in Lucca, who has also had spells with Palermo, Pisa and a loan stint with Ajax, brings "specific qualities to our team".

"Having played at the top level in different countries, he arrives with a good blend of experience and scope to continue developing as a player," said Edu.

"We are all looking forward to seeing the impact he can have for the rest of the season."

Forest are also interested in Lucca's Napoli team-mate Mathias Olivera, 28, as they assess their left-back options.

Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen has also been considered this month, with the Norway international available for Â£40m.

Forest are 17th in the Premier League, five points above the bottom three.

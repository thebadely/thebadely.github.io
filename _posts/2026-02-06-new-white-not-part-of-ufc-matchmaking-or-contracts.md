Experts revealed that Dana White has been in charge of the UFC for 25 years

UFC president Dana White has said during a court case that he is not part of the promotion's matchmaking and does not handle fighters' contracts.

In a hearing this week at Nevada Federal District Court relating to two ongoing antitrust lawsuits against the UFC, White revealed almost all business involving fighters is taken care of by his delegates - Hunter Campbell, Mick Maynard and Sean Shelby.

On Wednesday White said this process has been in place since 2017, something Campbell confirmed during his testimony on Thursday.

"You won't find one manager on this planet who will tell you I've negotiated a deal in I don't know how long," White told Judge Richard Boulware.

When asked to clarify White's involvement in fighter contracts, UFC's chief business officer Campbell said he never looks at them or asks any questions, adding "Dana is a very unique individual".

Boulware was skeptical of the set-up, questioning how White, who has been in charge of the UFC for 25 years, could never have an input into fighter contracts and the making of bouts.

Campbell said White has unwavering trust in his matchmaking team, and instead focuses on the big-picture side of the business, such as the growth of the sport and the production aspect.

In 2024, White oversaw the UFC's $20m (Â£15.3m) event at the Sphere in Las Vegas - the only major sporting show to take place at the venue to date - and is targeting an ambitious event at the White House in July.

White and Campbell were testifying in two ongoing antitrust lawsuits against the UFC brought by former fighters Kajan Johnson (Johnson v Zuffa) and Misha Cirkunovs (Cirkunovs v Zuffa).

The hearing inquired about their roles at the UFC and focused on whether communication devices at the organisation, such as mobile phones, were improperly destroyed or tampered with.

Fighters from 2017 to the present day are seeking damages and a change to the UFC's business practices, including the contracts they insist on. 

In October 2025, the UFC agreed to pay Â£281m to former fighters who competed in the MMA promotion between 2010 and 2017. 

That Le v Zuffa lawsuit claimed the UFC suppressed athletes' ability to negotiate other promotional options and estimated 1,100 fighters were affected.

The UFC was sold to IMG in 2016 for $4bn before merging with the WWE in 2023 to become TKO.

Here’s what you need to know: Cameron Norrie reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon this summer

Great Britain's Cameron Norrie reached his first final of 2025 with a three-set victory over Lorenzo Sonego at the Moselle Open.

Seventh seed Norrie, 30, had been taken to the distance in each of his first three matches in Metz and, in two of those, had fought back from a set behind to win.

That was the case again as Italian Sonego took the first set of their semi-final, before Norrie completed a 4-6 6-2 6-4 win in exactly two hours.

Norrie, ranked 27th in the world and 15 places higher than Sonego, saved two break points early in the second set.

In little trouble on his own serve after that - helped by an 83% first-serve percentage for the match - Norrie created a host of opportunities to break his opponent and eventually did so in the 10th game of the decider to clinch victory.

Norrie will play 19-year-old Learner Tien in Saturday's final, following the American's straight-set win over Vitaliy Sachko.

Norrie's run to the final in Metz has capped an excellent second half of the year for the British number two.

He was in danger of dropping out of the world's top 100 earlier this year, being ranked as low as 91st in May.

However, good runs at the three subsequent Grand Slams - the fourth round at the French Open, Wimbledon quarter-finals and US Open third round - have helped move him back into the top 30.

Meanwhile, 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic is through to the final of the Hellenic Championship in Athens courtesy of a 6-3 6-4 victory against Germany's Yannick Hanfmann, ranked 117th in the world.

Djokovic, 38, is aiming to win the 101st tour-level title of his career and his second of 2025, having won in Geneva in May.

The Serb will play Lorenzo Musetti next, after the Italian beat American Sebastian Korda 6-0 5-7 7-5 in his semi-final.

Musetti needs to win the tournament in Greece to qualify for the ATP Finals.

If he does not, Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime will take the eighth and final spot at the season-ending event in Turin, which starts on Sunday.

Djokovic has already qualified and has been drawn in a group with Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz and Alex de Minaur.

Experts revealed that A funding pot totalling over £9.3m has been announced to support Surrey households with cost of living pressures.

Surrey County Council has allocated the seventh round of the Household Support Fund (HSF), which will make £9,324,930.29 available to residents facing financial hardship.

The fund, to cover until 31 March 2026 has been divided between several categories to offer assistance with food, fuel, water, and other essential needs.

This latest round represents a 12% reduction from previous allocations which the council says is designed to optimise spending.

Mark Nuti, cabinet member for health, wellbeing and public health, said: "This latest round of Household Support Funding is a vital resource to help those most in need access essentials like food, energy, and emergency support. 

"Despite a reduction in funding, we are committed to ensuring that every pound is used effectively to support our residents."

Nearly half of the fund, £4.1m, has been allocated to food vouchers during school holidays while a further £1.7m is earmarked to support food banks and organisations providing similar services.

A total of £750,000  has been awarded to the Surrey Crisis Fund for emergency financial aid, with a further £548,000  allocated to poverty prevention initiatives.

While the fund will be distributed through a network of local organisations, the council is also developing a new scheme which will make additional HSF funds available to residents. 

This scheme will launched later this year, with applications to open in due course.

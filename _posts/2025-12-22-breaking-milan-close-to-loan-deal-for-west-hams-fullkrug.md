Let's dive into the details: Niclas Fullkrug has struggled with injuries since signing for West Ham last year

AC Milan are closing in on an initial six-month loan deal for West Ham United striker Niclas Fullkrug.

The Hammers will allow the Germany forward to leave London Stadium in January, with his first-team opportunities limited under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo.

Milan and West Ham are in advanced talks over an agreement that will see the 32-year-old move to Italy until the end of the season.

It could also include an option for Milan to make the move permanent.

Fullkrug, who has made just nine appearances for the Hammers this season, has scored three goals in 28 games for the club.

He joined from Borussia Dortmund for Â£19m in August 2024, but his first campaign was restricted by injury.

Experts revealed that Mustafizur Rahman made his IPL debut in 2016

Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders have released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

There was no reason given for the BCCI's request but it comes amid strained tensions between India and neighbouring Bangladesh. 

Last month, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in Muslim-majority Bangladesh in an episode that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.

Anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh has grown since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to the country in 2024.  

India has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, while violent protests broke out over the murder of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent student leader, in Bangladesh.

"Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad," said BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia.

"They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player."

Crisis in India-Bangladesh relations spirals amid violent protests

Mustafizur was the only Bangladesh player bought in the IPL auction for the 2026 season when KKR, who are majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, paid about Â£760,000 for the 30-year-old left armer.

"The release has been carried out following due process and consultations, upon the instruction of the Board of Control of Cricket in India," said a KKR statement.

"BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course."

Mustafizur has previously played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in the IPL, taking 60 wickets in 65 matches.

The 19th season of the IPL starts on 26 March.

Experts revealed that No player has scored more Scottish Premiership goals than Motherwell forward Tawanda Maswanhise this season

Tawanda Maswanhise needed a two-week trial period to convince then manager Stuart Kettlewell that he was worthy of a contract at Motherwell.

The Zimbabwe forward was in search of first-team football having just been released by Leicester City, where he had spent 13 years in the youth set-up.

"There's lots of potential with Tawanda and hopefully we can get the best out of him," former boss Kettlewell said after his arrival.

It is safe to say that potential is now being fulfilled.

Little over a year later, he is delivering a talismanic season for high-flying Motherwell and relishing an encounter with Egypt's Mohamed Salah at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.

Here, BBC Scotland charts the rise of the 23-year-old, who was named Scottish Premiership player of the month for November on Tuesday.

Despite a lack of first-team opportunities at Leicester, Maswanhise benefitted from being moulded by top-level coaching during his long spell at the club.

He played just once, an opportunity afforded to him by now Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca when he came on as a substitute in an FA Cup win over Millwall.

Pre-Maresca, Maswanhise credits part of his development to former Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, who worked at Leicester between 2019 and 2023.

"Having the experience to work under them was really good," the Motherwell man tells BBC Scotland. "I'd like to say I've learned quite a lot, adapting to two high-level managers.

"When I was with Brendan, it was more about getting used to the environment. Enzo needed a platform - he was really good tactically."

But how do those two compare with his current boss?

Jens Berthel Askou has received plenty of plaudits for implementing a fearless and vibrant approach to a Motherwell side well worth their current standing of third.

"I'd say he is similar," Maswanhise says when comparing Askou to Rodgers and Maresca. "The tactics and the system are really helping. It's clearly paying off right now.

"We're competing with the top teams in Scotland. If we can keep doing this, maybe we'll see ourselves on a European tour next season."

Maswanhise has been integral to Motherwell's push for Europe.

He has 12 goals in all competitions this term, eight of those coming in the league - nobody has more.

On the day his Motherwell signing was confirmed, he came off the bench to register the first of his 23 goal contributions for the club with an assist in a League Cup victory over Kilmarnock.

"It was time for a bit of a new environment, a new lifestyle for me up here in Scotland, and I feel like I've settled in really well," Maswanhise says when recalling his move north.

"And I think it was time to go and get some minutes and first-team football. I got it here and I'm still doing really well. It's been a good experience."

His debut set the tone for an explosive start to his Fir Park career, but he has since hit new heights this season.

Playing in a more central role, Askou's attack is being spearheaded by the speedy forward, who has become a far more clinical finisher this campaign.

His goal conversion rate of 27% from 30 shots makes for good reading, as does his minutes-per-goal average of 160.

Maintaining that for the season would ensure an impressive tally come the end of the campaign.

However, the Fir Park side will have to do without their top forward for a spell after his expected inclusion this week in Mario Marinica's squad for Afcon in Morocco.

Following Saturday's trip to Dundee United, Maswanhise would then be guaranteed to miss Motherwell's next three games - against Dundee, Rangers and Celtic - and that tally would increase if Zimbabwe progress.

While his absence may be sorely felt, his Motherwell team-mates will be willing him on to succeed in a section with Egypt, Angola and South Africa.

An opening group game with Egypt sets up the likelihood of lining up against Liverpool's disgruntled star, Salah, a match-up that reinforces Maswanhise's rapid rise.

"I'll really miss the team, honestly," he adds. "Hopefully they can continue this form. I'll be watching from Morocco.

''This is my first big tournament for my nation. Even though I'm one of the small fishes, hopefully I can make a name for myself.

"When I was with Leicester, I saw quite a lot of big fishes. I'm going to take that experience into this big tournament and hopefully not everyone will be starstruck by the players we're up against."

According to new developments, Reigning Man of Steel Mikey Lewis (left) has been at the core of Willie Peters' (right) Hull KR side - but will they cap off their fine form in 2025 with a trip to Wembley and the chance of silverware?

Down to the final four.

It is a bumper weekend in the men's and women's Challenge Cups with all four semi-finals scheduled to take place on Saturday and Sunday.

In the men's competition, Super League leaders Hull KR face 2018 winners Catalans Dragons while 2023 winners Leigh Leopards take on last year's beaten finalists Warrington Wolves.

You can watch both games on BBC television, on iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

What is the vibe on the road to Wembley? BBC Sport took a look at what is at stake.

Betfred Challenge Cup semi-final - Hull KR v Catalans Dragons

Venue: LNER Community Stadium, York Date: Saturday, 10 May Kick-off: 14:30 BST Coverage: Live on BBC One from 14:00 BST; commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Radio Humberside; live text on BBC Sport website & app

As seasons go, Hull KR have looked pretty slick so far in 2025.

They have two derby victories over Hull FC in their locker, a hard-fought win against Leeds Rhinos and a thrashing of Salford at Magic Weekend last week leading into Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Catalans.

Coach Willie Peters' side occupy top spot in Super League, with April's defeat by Wigan Warriors a solitary blot on an otherwise flawless copybook in league and cup this term.

Peters has lifted his side since his arrival, leading them to the Challenge Cup final two seasons ago and last season's Super League Grand Final, but silverware has evaded the Robins so far under his tenure.

However, forward Elliot Minchella believes KR are wiser for their near misses in the recent past.

"You have to learn from your experiences. Twelve months ago we lost and we had to watch another team go on to win the trophy," he told BBC Radio Humberside.

"We were really honest with ourselves. We weren't good enough that day and Wigan were the better team in last year's semi-finals.

"We have to learn from that and that's the business we're in. We want to win and to do that you have to learn from your losses.

"I want to be there again but we're not looking at that as a group. We're not really focused on the final. We are aware of it and we know if we get the outcome we want, we're aware of the reward. The game is our full focus."

Hooker Jez Litten goes into the trip to York after scoring two tries against Salford at Magic Weekend.

Having lost their opening three Super League games, Steve McNamara has stabilised Catalans' form to the point that they have won four of their past five games in all competitions heading into Saturday's semi-final.

Their one loss during that run came in a tight game at Magic Weekend against Leigh.

But Litten is wary of the threat the Dragons pose given their squad depth this season.

"They're good. Catalans are always a physical side. They always play well against us. I thought they were unlucky against Leigh. They're a big strong, solid pack. They've got some strike players out wide," Litten told BBC Radio Humberside.

"They've got players like Sam Tomkins, Tommy Makinson and Luke Keary who have been in big finals.

"We've got to focus on what we can do and get the job done.

"No semi-finals or finals should get given to you. You've got to go out and work hard and that's what we've got to do."

Leigh beat Hull KR on golden point in extra time

Rugby league is adapting to a new era, with radical new ideas such as Wigan's Super League fixture with Warrington taking place in Las Vegas - a venture which has been heralded as a success.

The Challenge Cup has mostly called Wembley its spiritual home for much of its history, but is there still a place for its iconic arch in the calendar?

For Leigh boss Adrian Lam, who has tasted success as both a player and coach in the competition, its history means the stadium should remain part of the furniture.

"There's always a place for Wembley in the Challenge Cup final. I was fortunate to play in one myself and I'll forever hold that in my heart as close as anything," he told BBC Radio Manchester.

"Not too many players get the chance to play in a Challenge Cup final or to coach in one, so we're really looking forward to the challenge ahead."

As for Lam's son Lachlan, who kicked the winning drop-goal in their historic win at Wembley two years ago, he did not have much time to reflect on his achievement given the club's swift turnaround back to Super League action.

"I don't think I've watched the game from start to finish since the day it happened. It just all happened very quickly," Lachlan Lam told BBC Radio Manchester.

"The town was buzzing and it all just flowed and before we knew it we were playing the next game against Catalans, so it just came and went pretty quickly."

Sam Powell was on the losing side in last season's Challenge Cup final as Warrington Wolves were defeated by Wigan Warriors

Warrington Wolves hooker Sam Powell has plenty of pedigree in the Challenge Cup, but is yet to experience victory in a final.

Powell was on the losing side for Wigan as Hull FC won in 2017, while he also lost to his former side when Warrington reached last season's final.

Should the Wire beat in-form Leigh on Sunday, it would set up the chance for the 32-year-old to tick off an honour missing from an impressive career.

"I've not actually played in a Challenge Cup final and won it yet. For one reason or another I've been banned or I've lost in a couple of them," he said.

"It's one I'd like to get my hands on.

"I'd love the opportunity to take my girls down there and let them see me win it."

Warrington were on the losing side when they faced Leigh over the Easter weekend last month and Powell believes his side are the underdogs when they take them on again on Sunday.

"They're a physical and big team," he added. "They had a big turnover of players at the start of the year. We had a good crack against them a couple of weeks ago and this time it will be similar.

"Off form Leigh are probably the favourites. I see it being a close game. It's a semi-final, a big game. Two teams going at it."

According to new developments, Wood was England's leading wicket-taker on their last Ashes trip down under with 17 wickets in four matches 

Bowler Mark Wood says he has "pulled up really well" from England's first days training in Australia as he bids to be ready for the first Ashes Test.

England's squad arrived in Perth on Sunday and have trained this week as they prepare for the series which begins on 21 November.

Wood has not played a Test for 15 months and has not played any competitive cricket since knee surgery on an injury suffered at the Champions Trophy in February. 

"It is very hard to train at 100% all of the time, but I have been off my full run-up and trying to up the intensity as I go along," Wood, 35, said.

"I am hoping in the practice game I can up it a little more again and gradually get ready for that first game."

Wood is England's quickest bowler and is expected to be crucial to their hopes of winning the Ashes for the first time since 2015. 

He and captain Ben Stokes are the only members of England's bowling group to have played a Test down under.

While Wood has repeatedly overcome his fragile body to return from injuries with impressive effect throughout his career, this comeback has not been straightforward. 

He had hoped to be fit for the fifth Test against India in early August before a setback and was left out of all of England's white-ball matches, against South Africa in September and the tour of New Zealand which ended last week, to prioritise the Ashes. 

Plans for Wood to play in the County Championship for Durham in September were also shelved. 

Instead, Wood has built up his fitness in the nets at Durham, around England matches at training and in the tent at the National Cricket Centre in Loughborough, which England have used to replicate Australian conditions.

Wood said he hopes to continue his work in training and then play in England's only warm-up fixture before the first Test - a match against England Lions in Perth, which begins next Wednesday.

"I have trained for two or three days and pulled up really well," said Wood.

"Going into the practice game, that will be another good test again but so far so good."

On his comeback, Wood added: "[It was] really boring for six months and it was never a straight trajectory. 

"There were some bits I was not doing as well and I had to build it up again. It is finally nice to be outside in some nice weather ramping it up."

England's squad has been welcomed to Australia with hostile headlines from the local media with the West Australian Newspaper calling Stokes "Cocky Captain Complainer".

Wood said he has not paid any attention to the coverage.

"That's all part of it," Wood said.

"I haven't taken much notice of newspapers, but the reception we have had in general from Australians has been great. 

"In the hotel and out and about in Perth everyone has been very friendly and is excited for the series."

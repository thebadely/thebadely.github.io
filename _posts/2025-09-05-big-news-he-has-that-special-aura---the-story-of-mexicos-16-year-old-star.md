Let's dive into the details: Mora was 16 years and 265 days old when he started for Mexico in their Concacaf Gold Cup final victory over the United States in July

Lamine Yamal's status as the youngest player to win a major senior international tournament didn't last long - 358 days to be exact.

In Europe, not so much is known about the 16-year-old who took the record Yamal broke when he won Euro 2024 with Spain against England.

But we soon will.

The chances are, by the time next summer's World Cup comes around, Gilberto Mora will be a huge topic of conversation.

Twelve months ago, debate within Mexico's football circles was whether Mora should prioritise the Under-20 or Under-17 World Cups, both of which are being held this autumn.

As it turns out, he will skip this month's senior friendlies against Japan and South Korea go to the under-20 version in Chile. After that, all routes will lead to 11 June and Mexico City and the opening game of the 2026 World Cup.

Mora looks certain to play a central role.

"Gil is only 16 and already he is competing with men at the highest level and making an impact for his country," said Club Tijuana owner Jorge Alberto.

"To see a player who grew up here, at our club, at Tijuana, go and perform like that - it's special. It's pride for me personally, pride for the club, and pride for the city."

Mora was 16 years and 265 days old when he started for Mexico in their Concacaf Gold Cup final victory over the United States in Houston in July.

He had come into Javier Aguirre's side for the quarter-final with Saudi Arabia and stayed there. Sports Illustrated named Mora man of the match in the semi-final triumph over Honduras, in which he supplied the crucial pass for Fulham striker Raul Jimenez to score the only goal.

"He's only 16 but already plays with confidence and personality and is unafraid of the occasion," said Jimenez, a legendary figure for Mexico himself.

"I believe he can be a key figure for the national team and someone who inspires the next generation."

Some of the statistics around Mora are startling.

He made his debut in Liga MX, Mexico's top flight, aged 15 years and 308 days, becoming Club Tijuana's youngest ever player and, as it turned out, the youngest player to claim an assist in the league. Less than a fortnight later he became the league's youngest goal scorer.

In January, he became the youngest player to feature for Mexico. Then he took Yamal's record.

The son of a former professional, also called Gilberto, Mora revered Cristiano Ronaldo as a child and moved to Tijuana from his home city Tuxtla Gutierrez aged six. He joined the club's youth set-up at 10.

As the story goes, Mora was so obsessed with football that when his family went to enroll him in schools, if he discovered he wouldn't be allowed to play with his ball at recess, he didn't want to go.

It hardly needs to be said he can play. Yet, to be trusted to hold down a central midfield berth for the national side in a country as football obsessed as Mexico at such a young age, you need more.

Sources have cited composure, movement, intelligence and a willingness to link play as the defining aspects of his game. Crucially 'maturity beyond his age' was another significant factor.

"I first met Gil six months ago," said Rafaela Pimenta, the Brazilian who is now his agent.

"What struck me was how serious and focused he was for someone his age, and how impressive his English was too.

"He showed right away that he was looking at football not just as a game, but as a career he was ready to dedicate himself to."

Mora has been educated in bilingual schools and has private one-to-one tuition in English.

In an era where Jude Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold have both been praised for being able to speak Spanish following their respective moves to Real Madrid, Mora conducted a news conference in English before Tijuana's Leagues Cup encounter with Colorado Rapids last month.

All the talk is of a grounded young man, who goes to Mass, is exceptionally close to his family, spends extra hours on the training ground practicing his skills and is bonded to the team ethic.

If Mora maintains his present trajectory and the anticipated accolades do come, all that will be tested to its fullest extent.

Pimenta's guidance will be crucial as the months and years go on.

Strong rumours have already started circulating about Real Madrid's interest in Mora. Through national team legends Hugo Sanchez and Javier Hernandez there is a historical Mexican link to the Bernabeu already.

For now though, the World Cup is the teenager's primary target, not just playing at it, but making a significant impact.

"What sets Gil apart is not just his talent but the calm maturity he brings to every situation," said Pimenta.

"On the pitch and off it, he is exactly the same - focused, respectful, and looking at the long journey ahead. He has that special aura that only certain players have, the magnetism you feel when he walks into a room. It inspires people around him, not only in Mexico but also beyond."

Unlike Yamal, whose reputation has grown so quickly that - still aged only 18 - comparisons are already starting to be made with Lionel Messi, few in Europe have seen Mora play.

Word is starting to get round though, as Alberto observed during the midfielder's two-goal performance against LA Galaxy in the United States last month.

"Every time he touched the ball, the crowd erupted - not just our fans, but Galaxy supporters and Mexican fans in general," he said.

"The same thing happened in Colorado, where we don't have a fan-base. People who had never followed Tijuana were applauding him.

"Now in Mexico it's the same story. Wherever we go, in every city, rival fans applaud him.

"That tells you something very powerful - he is already becoming a figure for the whole country."

By next June, the whole world is likely to be watching.

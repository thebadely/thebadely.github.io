Let's dive into the details: Marta Mathews has helped GB reach the past two European finals and finish fifth at their maiden World Games last month

Great Britain women are through to the last four as they aim to defend their title at the European Flag Football Championships.

After topping their group with a 100% record from four games, GB beat Slovenia 51-14 in the quarter-finals in Paris on Friday.

The European champions will now take on hosts France on Saturday (07:00 BST) while Spain - who GB beat in the 2023 final - face world number two Austria in the other semi-final. The winners will meet in the final at 13:15 BST.

GB women came into the European Championships in encouraging form having claimed a fifth-placed finish in their maiden World Games last month, when only the women's event was contested.

The GB men's team has also reached Saturday's semi-finals, where they will face Italy (08:15 BST). France take on Austria in the other semi, with the winners to contest the final at 14:30 BST.

After winning four of their five group games, GB's men beat Denmark 32-19 in the quarter-finals to ensure they will improve on their sixth-placed finish in Ireland in 2023.

The semi-finalists in each event have all qualified for next year's World Championships in Germany.

Ranking points are also on offer in Paris as the teams prepare for flag football to make its Olympic debut at the Los Angeles 2028 Games.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The government's asylum policy is said to be "in chaos" by The Sun, and "in disarray" according to the i Paper after Tuesday's court ruling on a migrant hotel in Epping. The Daily Mail says ministers have been left "stunned" and it predicts the council's victory could open the floodgates to a series of similar legal actions. 

For the Daily Express, it is a major boost to communities who feel their concerns have been ignored. The Daily Telegraph says migrant hotels across the country are now facing closure, and it says more protests are likely this weekend. 

The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has written an article for the paper saying the people of Epping have "stood up bravely and have won", despite being "slandered as far-right by the establishment".

The other main story on the front pages is President Donald Trump's insistence that no American troops will be deployed to Ukraine as part of any peace deal. The Guardian says that "tempers" the promise he made to provide Kyiv with security guarantees. It says Mr Trump is reassuring his supporters, who prefer US foreign policy to be isolationist. 

According to The Daily Mirror, Donald Trump has shifted responsibility for policing any agreement to Britain and Europe. The Times thinks that divisions between the US and Europe are emerging, following Monday's show of unity in Washington. 

And its editorial says difficult questions remain about how the west can deal with Vladimir Putin, who simply "is not to be trusted". The Financial Times says Donald Trump needs to pay more attention to detail if he is to stand any chance of bringing peace to Ukraine.

The latest claim about the Autumn Budget is that Rachel Reeves is drawing up what has been called a "mansion tax", affecting sales of the most expensive homes. 

The Times says the chancellor wants to remove the exemption from capital gains tax which applies when somebody sells their main residence. The paper says property experts are warning that home-owners might simply stay put if faced with a big bill, meaning the government loses revenue, and that pensioners wanting to downsize would be affected. The Treasury said it did not comment on speculation.

Several papers do, though they are still chewing over previous reports of a property tax to replace stamp duty. The i Paper says there are concerns the idea could have a serious impact on the housing market. And the Daily Mail says it is clear that "the government is coming for our properties", calling it a "spiteful class war".

The Financial Times reports that the global frenzy for furry Labubu dolls has more than tripled sales at their Chinese manufacturer, Pop Mart. It says the firm has become one of the world's most valuable toy companies, worth more than twice as much as Hasbro and Mattel combined. About 40% of Pop Mart's income is now from outside China, after the craze for the ugly Labubu dolls was embraced by celebrities including Sir David Beckham and Rihanna.

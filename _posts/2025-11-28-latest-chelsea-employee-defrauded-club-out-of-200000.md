Experts revealed that A Chelsea employee has pleaded guilty to defrauding the football club out of more than £200,000.

Claire Walsh, who worked as an assistant treasury manager at the Premier League side, obtained £208,520 for herself between 8 June 2019 and 23 October 2023, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

The 39-year-old, who admitted a charge of fraud by abuse of position, was told by Magistrate Kieran O'Donnell: "You've pleaded guilty to the offence and it exceeds our powers in terms of sentencing. You'll need to be sent to a crown court for sentencing, where they have the appropriate powers."

Walsh, of Elm Park Gardens, Chelsea, will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on a date yet to be confirmed.

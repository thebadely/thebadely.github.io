According to new developments, Great Britain have never won the Billie Jean King Cup

Great Britain captain Anne Keothavong has named a strong line-up for the Billie Jean King Cup, with Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Emma Raducanu and Jodie Burrage all included.

Boulter is ranked 41 in the world, with Kartal at 45, Raducanu at 46 and Burrage 116.

Great Britain beat Germany and Netherlands in April to seal their place in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Shenzhen, China in September.

They will play Japan in the quarter-finals on Thursday, 18 September and, if they get through, face the winner of the tie between the United States and Kazakhstan.

Britain have never won the women's team event and last reached the final in 1981 when the competition was known as the Federation Cup.

Kartal recently impressed at Wimbledon as her progress to the fourth round was the furthest of any of the GB women.

Raducanu reached the third round before she was beaten by world number one Aryna Sabalenka.

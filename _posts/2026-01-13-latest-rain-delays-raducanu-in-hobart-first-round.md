According to new developments, Emma Raducanu lost her first match of 2026 to Maria Sakkari at the United Cup

Britain's Emma Raducanu will have to return to the court on Wednesday after her first-round match against Camila Osorio at the Hobart International was suspended because of rain.

Raducanu, bidding for her first win of the 2026 season, led the Colombian 6-3 2-4 when play was suspended.

It was a back-and-forth match, with both players battling the blustery conditions and Osorio struggling with a persistent cough. 

The first three games of the first set went against serve before Raducanu rallied, taking the opener in 45 minutes against her wildcard opponent.

World number 82 Osorio found another gear in the second set, hitting four winners in the opening game and using her sliced backhand drop shots to break the Raducanu serve.

After a 30-minute break, the players returned to court and managed just two points before the heavy rain returned.

Raducanu, who had her off-season disrupted by a foot injury, is playing in her final tournament before the Australian Open begins on Sunday.

World number 29 Raducanu showed some impressive ball-striking behind her forehand but she struggled against Osorio's drop shots.

The Briton opted not to chase down three shorter balls played by Colombian in the first set and lost some of her intensity after the first rain delay.

Raducanu's change of intent - opting to work Osorio around the court instead of overpowering her in the rallies - allowed the Colombian to claim three successive breaks of serve in the second set.

The 23-year-old now faces a short turnaround before finishing off her first-round match tomorrow.

Poland's Magdalena Frech, who was a comfortable 6-4 6-0 winner over France's Elsa Jacquemot, awaits either Raducanu or Osorio in the quarter-finals.

Elsewhere, Britain's Harriet Dart progressed to the second qualifying round in Melbourne as she bids for a place in the Australian Open main draw.

Dart, the British number five and world number 169, beat Australia's Destanee Aiava 6-3 2-6 6-3 and will face Thailand's Lanlana Tararudee next.

However, fellow Briton Mimi Xu's hopes were ended by Czech player Darja Vidmanova in a 6-3 2-6 6-2 loss.

In the men's draw, Ryan Peniston was beaten 6-1 6-1 by Argentine Roman Andres Burruchaga.

Billy Harris lost 6-3 6-4 to Chris Rodesch of Luxembourg, while Jan Choinski exited with a 6-3 6-4 defeat by Switzerland's Leandro Riedi.

Elsewhere, 17-year-old Cruz Hewitt, son of two-time major winner Lleyton Hewitt, had his hopes of qualifying for his home slam ended by American Michael Zheng.

At the Adelaide International, Jacob Fearnley lost to Frenchman Quentin Halys 6-3 6-4 after reaching the main draw as a lucky loser.

Here’s what you need to know: Daryl Gurney celebrates after hitting the double eight which sealed the World Cup of Darts for Northern Ireland on Sunday

Daryl Gurney says he hopes his and Josh Rock's victory for Northern Ireland in the World Cup of Darts in Germany can help "push on" the sport, but admits their triumph "hasn't sunk in".

The pair won a thrilling last leg to beat Wales 10-9 and be crowned world champions for the first time.

They were forced to regroup following four missed darts to wrap up the win when 9-8 ahead as Welsh pair, Gerwyn Price and Jonny Clayton, took advantage to level.

Gurney kept his cool in the decider to nail double eight and seal the Â£80,000 first prize amid emotional scenes and he hopes their achievement will help inspire the next generation.

"If me and Josh can help push on darts, it would be brilliant, but we've always had a brilliant standard of players," said Gurney.

"With Josh coming through and me winning in previous years, I feel as though more people are taking the chance on not just playing the game, but managers are taking note of Irish players and sponsoring them to give them that chance.

"To play in the PDC (Professional Darts Corporation), you need that funding to do all the travelling and some people are taking the chance on Irish players to find the next Josh Rock."

Gurney was speaking on Monday as he prepared to head for home and admitted there was no time for wild celebrations on Sunday night.

Following victory over South Africa on Saturday, the pair had to come through matches against the Republic of Ireland and Germany earlier on Sunday, before beating Wales in the decider.

It provided a mental test but Gurney commended his playing partner, whom he is tipping to reach the very top of the sport.

"Josh was immense, the best player in the competition for me," he said.

"His scoring was unreal, he pumped them in at perfect times. He has been on fire all year, a future world champion, future major champion and just a pleasure to play with him. He made my job a lot easier.

"We made the decisions together. He wanted to throw first and I was more than happy to let him do that."

Hitting the double eight to seal victory was a sweet moment for Gurney who had been waiting since the 2018 Players Championship for a third major title.

Out of the four players in the final, Gurney is the lowest ranked, so there were some nerves as he got ready to take out the match-winning double eight.

"Those boys have been there and done it more frequently than me over the last couple of years, so I'm still buzzing now," he added.

Doku stands out as Man City dominate Liverpool

Manchester City delivered a deafening statement of intent to celebrate Pep Guardiola's landmark 1,000th match in management as Liverpool were dismissed out of hand at Etihad Stadium.

City's 3-0 win carried an ominous warning for Premier League leaders Arsenal, whose advantage at the top was cut to four points, while it inflicted a grievous wound on Liverpool and their hopes of back-to-back titles.

Guardiola had to navigate City through troubled waters last season as their historic run of four successive titles ended, with questions raised about the 54-year-old Spaniard's ability to rebuild.

After years of almost unbroken success with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City, was Guardiola still eager enough to create another team of champions?

This was the most emphatic answer from Guardiola and his players, a performance that was at once dazzling, dangerous and full of the power and tempo that suggests City are very much back in shape to challenge for the Premier League trophy.

If Guardiola had asked for a gift from City's players to commemorate their inspirational manager on his big day, this was the perfect present.

Guardiola saw it that way, saying: "I just want to say thank you to the players, backroom staff to give me that present. I'm proud to do it here in Manchester with my City."

The spectacle would have been the opposite of celebratory for Arsenal and, very painfully here, Liverpool.

Arsenal are still in pole position, but this is only after 11 games and City have proved in the past they enjoy making opponents feel their breath on their shoulders.

After Arsenal dropped two points late on at Sunderland on Saturday, the door was suddenly ajar. City burst through in spectacular fashion.

For Liverpool, this was a sobering, chastening experience.

It was here at Etihad Stadium last February that Liverpool's 2-0 win completed the double over City, also effectively settling the title chase.

This game, both in result and performance, was a complete contrast. Liverpool were overrun by a revitalised City.

It is not a defeat that ends their hopes of keeping hold of their crown - we are only 11 games into the season, after all.

However, it is increasingly difficult to see how Liverpool can present a serious challenge in their current shape after a fifth loss in six league games.

City preyed on Liverpool's vulnerable midfield and defence throughout, as others have done this season.

Slot was unhappy that Virgil van Dijk's header, which would have made it 1-1 before half-time, was disallowed for offside.

Defender Andy Robertson, who was certainly in an offside position, ducked in front of City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to allow the ball to drift in. Many felt Robertson's presence was inconsequential and that the goal should have stood, but ultimately the Reds were given a brutal lesson.

Once Nico Gonzalez's deflected shot made it 2-0 just before half-time, the contest was effectively over.

Guardiola seems re-energised by the task of putting City right after a poor campaign by their standards last time out, assembling a range of attacking weapons capable of winning any game - led by the remarkable spearhead of Haaland.

The first goal on Sunday was rich in the creativity that is Guardiola's hallmark, a magical moment that was a fitting way to mark his big day. It was a masterpiece that will live long in the memory.

City weaved their way out from facing Liverpool pressure near their own corner flag with a glorious sequence of passes from back to front.

This symphony of Guardiola's style ended in a familiar crescendo as Haaland soared above Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate to meet Matheus Nunes' cross and send a header past keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.

Nunes' cross that set up Haaland's header was the 19th pass in the move that simply cut through Liverpool until it reached its final flourish.

It could be used as a monument to Guardiola's footballing philosophy.

Haaland had already uncharacteristically wasted a chance to put City ahead as his penalty was saved by Mamardashvili after the keeper was penalised for upending Jeremy Doku, but it was not long before the remarkable striker scored his 99th Premier League goal.

'I like a lot of things I see' - Guardiola

Doku is a transformative symbol of this new City. 

The 23-year-old has gone from being an unquestionably talented winger, but sometimes maddeningly inconsistent, to the brilliant catalyst behind so much of their best moments this season.

He gave Conor Bradley, outstanding in Liverpool's win against Real Madrid in the Champions League, a horrible time. Bradley was run ragged by the pace and physical presence of Doku - although surely no-one could cope with the Belgian in this form.

Doku was simply unstoppable, a player now in full flower after finally becoming accustomed to Guardiola's high demands following a Â£55.4m move from Rennes in August 2023.

Rayan Cherki adds subtlety in midfield, while Phil Foden is back to his best and Bernardo Silva still has all the old guile to keep City moving with his prompting.

It was a resounding win in every way, giving Arsenal and their manager Mikel Arteta - formerly Guardiola's assistant - a hefty helping of food for thought over the international break.

For Liverpool, this was a return to earth with a resounding thud after their recent upturn.

They now languish in eighth place, eight points behind Arsenal and four adrift of City, but with momentum stalled. Liverpool's tally of five defeats this season now eclipses the four they suffered when they won the title.

And there are still disturbing signs that Liverpool have yet to adapt to the summer influx of almost Â£450m worth of new talent.

Hugo Ekitike, one of the successes, was subdued here while Â£125m fellow striker Alexander Isak was an unused substitute after three weeks out with a groin injury.

It was another day of suffering and disappointment for Â£116m playmaker Florian Wirtz, whose struggles were made worse by the taunts of City's fans, remembering how he turned down a move to Etihad Stadium in order to join Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen.

Wirtz, at this stage, clearly struggles with the physicality of the Premier League. The talent is clearly there, but too often he is shrugged off easily in possession.

It is something he will have to get used to and counter-act. Inevitable barracking came Wirtz's way with a chant of "what a waste of money" from jubilant home fans when he was replaced by Federico Chiesa seven minutes from time.

Guardiola, meanwhile, revelled in the victory but looked forward to the games that will follow the international break.

"Now rest and come back with the energy," he said, before reflecting on the pathway that brought him to this stage of a remarkable coaching life.

"I think my period at Barcelona B is the foundation for many things. To realise that I was able to do it and learn a lot.

"I will never forget the guys in that first season. For me, it has been so special to make 1,000 games in front of my family and especially against Liverpool. I have a huge respect for that club."

This was Guardiola's day of celebration. And City made it an occasion to remember.

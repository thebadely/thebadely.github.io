Experts revealed that Curry's tackle on full-back Juan Cruz Mallia fuelled a string of confrontations after the final whistle

England flanker Tom Curry will escape any punishment for a tunnel tussle with Argentina coach Felipe Contepomi in the ill-tempered aftermath of their teams' autumn international.

Contepomi accused Curry of being a "bully", claiming the 27-year-old pushed him in the chest as the pair argued over a tackle which left the Pumas full-back Juan Cruz Mallia with knee ligament damage.

However, after reviewing security camera footage from Allianz Stadium and taking statements from those involved, the Six Nations, which organises the autumn series, has opted against taking action.

"Considering all factors leading into and beyond incident, based on the balance of information, and acknowledging a highly charged end to the fixture, no formal sanction will be issued to either party," it said.

However, it has warned that the incident will remain on file though for both Curry and Contepomi.

"Should a similar incident by either party occur in future tournaments, the record of this incident will be brought to the attention of the relevant Disciplinary Committee," it added.

Curry was confronted by several Argentina players after the final whistle of England's 27-23 win, with Harlequins wing Rodrigo Isgro among those angered by his tackle on Mallia.

Curry had made contact with Toulouse's Mallia just after he had kicked upfield.

Contepomi said that Curry, on his way to the dressing room, then attempted to greet Argentina assistant coach Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, who played for Curry's club side Sale between 2006 and 2009.

"Fernandez said 'no, no' because we were upset because he was reckless and broke our player's knee," said Contepomi.

"I said 'mate, you broke his knee', and he pushed me.

"After breaking someone's knee you need to be at least humble enough and respectful to say sorry I did something wrong. But he went the opposite."

Curry was given strong support by his coaches at both club and country.

England boss Steve Borthwick said Curry's character was "unquestionable" and "impeccable", while Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson said the claim Curry was a bully was "laughable" and "ridiculous".

At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, Curry was at the centre of controversy after claiming that South Africa hooker Bongi Mbonambi had used a racial slur during the Springboks' 16-15 semi-final win.

World Rugby opted not to take action in that case, saying there was insufficient evidence.

Mbonambi claimed Curry had mistaken a Afrikaans term for a similar-sounding English swearword.

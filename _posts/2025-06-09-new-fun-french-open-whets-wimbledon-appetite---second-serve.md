It has been recently reported that In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko reviews the French Open and looks ahead to the grass-court season.

Everyone needed a lie down after two intense French Open finals.

When Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz both fell flat on the court after winning the respective Roland Garros singles titles, it summed up a chaotic conclusion to a thrilling tournament.

It was a French Open that delivered the lot - and whets the appetite for the Wimbledon, which is just around the corner.

Recent editions of the clay-court Grand Slam tournament have been rather predictable.

Rafael Nadal regularly handed out one-sided beatings on his way to a scarcely believable 14 triumphs over a 17-year stretch, while Iga Swiatek did similar in her four victories between 2020 and 2024.

So two exciting singles tournaments this year - both going all the way with nobody able to predict which way they would turn - were a fitting finish.

Alcaraz facing Jannik Sinner in the menâs final was not a surprise. But the first meeting between the ATP Tourâs standout pair in a Grand Slam showpiece ended in an all-time classic to further fuel what is fast becoming a must-see rivalry.

That rounded out a menâs tournament where Novak Djokovic showed he can still have a say at the top of the game.

Sinner and Alcaraz thriller proves rivalry here to stay

Murray open to coaching return 'at some stage'

Raducanu 'wary' when she goes out after stalking ordeal

Would you rule the Serb great out of winning Wimbledon for an eighth time and matching Roger Federerâs all-time men's record for the tournament? Absolutely not.

But you'd think he would need to avoid defending champion Alcaraz and world number one Sinner on the way.

Throwing in a genuine British hope with Jack Draper - who is now fourth in the world - further fuels the excitement for the All England Club.

On the women's side, Sabalenka will remain favourite despite the painful nature of her defeat by Gauff.

Sabalenka's powerful game works on any surface and, although she fell agonisingly short of a first clay-court major, you would still back her to win a non-hard court major.

But, with eight different winners in the past eight editions, the women's singles at Wimbledon has been unpredictable in recent years.

Bring it on.

The debate about the French Open night sessions reignited. No women's matches were chosen for the primetime spot, leading to accusations the tournament did not think the female stars were worthy of it.

Rafael Nadal, a 14-time champion here, was given an emotional send-off following his retirement last year. The other members of the 'Big Four' - Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - joined him on court.

She might have insisted it was not a "miracle", but French wildcard Lois Boisson reaching the semi-finals in her first Grand Slam tournament was incredible.

Britain's Draper might have lost earlier than expected when he was beaten by 62nd-ranked Alexander Bublik in the last 16 in Paris, but he has reached a new career high of fourth in the world.

Italy's Lorenzo Musetti moved up to sixth after reaching the semi-finals, while American Tommy Paul - up to eighth after making the quarter-finals - is the third man in the top 10 to climb to a new career high.

Britain's Cameron Norrie is the sharpest riser in the top 100, jumping 21 spots to 60 after reaching the fourth round.

It always felt Iga Swiatek's reign as the 'Queen of Clay' was under threat going into Roland Garros - and so it proved.

The four-time champion's semi-final exit means she has dropped to seventh in the world - her lowest ranking since the start of 2022.

The biggest leap in the WTA rankings came, of course, from 22-year-old Boisson.

The French wildcard started her maiden Grand Slam ranked 361st and has climbed a whopping 296 spots to a career-high 65th.

Who says the British can't play on clay?

Norrie, 29, slipped perilously close to dropping out of the top 100 before reaching the Geneva final and then the Roland Garros last 16 for the first time.

Draper reached the fourth round and Jacob Fearnley advanced to the third round on his debut - losing to Norrie - while Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal both earned their first main-draw wins.

Boulter, Emma Raducanu and Kartal each continued their upward trajectory in the world rankings, with Kartal now a top-50 player for the first time.

Doubles pair Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury continued their progress as a pairing by reaching the men's final, while Alfie Hewett was runner-up in the wheelchair singles.

Hewett fought back from heartbreak, though, to clinch a sixth successive doubles title with partner Gordon Reid.

And 16-year-old Hannah Klugman underlined her huge potential by becoming the first Briton to reach the junior final in almost 50 years.

A host of LTA grass-court tournaments have already started in the UK.

On Monday, the WTA event at Queen's - the first time that a women's tournament has been held at the west London club since 1973 - returns.

Britain's Boulter, Raducanu and Kartal headline the event, which you can follow across the BBC.

On the ATP Tour, the grass-court swing kicks off with events in German city Stuttgart and sâHertogenbosch in the Netherlands.

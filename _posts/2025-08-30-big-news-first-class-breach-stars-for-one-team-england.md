'First-class' Breach deserves to be England's first-choice wing - Middleton

Different team, same result.

Even with John Mitchell making 13 changes to his starting XV, World Cup favourites England demolished amateur side Samoa in Northampton.

The world's number one-ranked team were always expected to win big, the question was how big.

Given Samoa's part-time players had to crowdfund to take their place in the tournament and are the second lowest ranked side in the tournament in 15th, a record 92-3 Women's World Cup win for fully professional England came as no surprise.

The victory sealed England's spot in the knockout stages, which was the number one goal prior to kick-off, and gave Mitchell's players a chance to stake a claim for a permanent starting spot.

"It's not about comparing the line-ups, we are one team and one circle," Mitchell told BBC Sport.

"You can get loose when the scoreboard builds but we didn't do that. I am thrilled with the performance.

"We could select anyone at the end of the day, we will need everyone because the injury gods haven't been kind to us."

Samoa are appearing at their first Women's Rugby World Cup since 2014 and came into the game off the back of a 73-0 defeat by Australia.

Given the weak opposition, it was an ideal chance for England's backline stars to shine.

Utility back Helena Rowland proved a more than capable back-up fly-half as she scored 27 points to break the individual record in a Women's World Cup game.

It was not just the points but Rowland's kicking from hand that stood out, with multiple excellent clearance kicks.

"Helena was outstanding," said Mitchell. "She has got a great skill set. She probed the game well. The girls fed off her direction and she directed the attack really well to allow us to go forward."

Her half-back partner Lucy Packer scored a sharp try from the base of the ruck and her rapid service helped give Rowland time to get the backline moving.

Megan Jones continued her fine form in the centre, scoring two well-taken tries, while competition on the wing continues to heat up.

England score 14 tries in record World Cup win over Samoa

Jess Breach, one of the two players to retain their place from the 69-7 victory over the United States, was criticised last week for failing to make a try-saving tackle in the first half but responded with a hat-trick against Samoa to step up her bid to nail down a starting spot.

Claudia Moloney-MacDonald took Breach's spot for the Women's Six Nations Grand Slam decider in April, but has since dropped out of the side after a hamstring injury delayed her preparation and start to the World Cup.

The 29-year-old returned in Northampton and scored the final try of the game, but had a mixed display compared to the lethal Breach, who now has 52 tries in 49 caps.

"Jess was very good at her one-on-one duels. She can find half a metre and she'll burn you," Mitchell said.

"She's confident and she's done a lot of work to put herself in that position. When she's like that, she's outstanding."

Former England head coach Simon Middleton praised Breach's workrate.

"Jess put on an absolute first-class wing performance," he told BBC Sport.

"She stood up her opposing wing, went looking for work and popped up all over the field. She responded to the challenge of the players around her competing for the shirt."

A hip injury to Breach in November meant she lacked match fitness heading into the Six Nations, where she failed to score.

Now back up to speed, Breach has bagged five tries in two World Cup games.

"I am back and really enjoying my rugby, I am feeling the fittest I have ever done," Breach told BBC Sport.

"The whole squad is competitive and that is good and why we are the number one team in the world. It is friendly competition as everyone knows their place in the squad."

'Competition for places driving England on' - hat-trick scorer Breach

That return to form was summed up by a searing break in the second half, where the England wing almost ran half the pitch to score after some nifty footwork.

"She came close to scoring the try of the tournament but her right toe touched the line," New Zealand wing Ruby Tui told BBC Sport.

"She was full of confidence and you could see that the way she worked off her wing."

Abby Dow has always been first choice on the right wing under Mitchell, leaving Moloney-MacDonald battling Breach for the final starting wing spot.

Following a second neck injury in February 2024, the thought of playing again was a huge ask for Moloney-MacDonald, who said she was "terrified to be anywhere near a rugby pitch".

"When I look back it is unbelievable, to think a year a go I was scared to turn up to training because I didn't want to get hit by a ball. I am just proud to be here in the moment," Moloney-MacDonald told BBC Sport.

"To be at the top of your game you have to always be competitive and want to fight for the shirt."

England's energy was 'outstanding' against Samoa - coach Mitchell

With the score 47-0, Samoa registered their first points of the World Cup through the boot of Harmony Vatau.

The Pacific Island side failed to qualify for the past two World Cups and have not won a game in the tournament since 2006.

Vatau's kick was greeted with huge celebrations from the players and supporters to signify their return on the biggest stage.

"I did [smile when we got points], initially I wanted us to tap and go but we talked about getting some points which we did and we avoided that zero," Samoa head coach Ramsey Tomokino told BBC Sport.

"But a goal was to cross that line and we didn't."

Tomokino handed eight players their World Cup debut against England, with some of his squad taking unpaid leave from their jobs to play in the tournament.

A final game against the United States next Saturday in York could provide the best chance for a first try in the tournament since 2014.

"We need more rugby in Samoa, we need to be part of a professional competition, that would help us," Tomokino added. 

"Our players are spread out around the world.

"It would be fantastic to go to York and get a win, we will be targeting that. We have rotated our players because all of our players deserve to play."

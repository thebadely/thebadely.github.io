Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Son Heung-min became Tottenham captain in August 2023

Tottenham captain Son Heung-min says he will leave the club this summer after 10 years.

The South Korea international joined Spurs from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 and has scored 173 goals in 454 appearances.

He was captain when Tottenham beat Manchester United in the Europa League final in May to clinch their first trophy in 17 years.

The 33-year-old, who is under contract with Spurs until 2026, has been linked with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC.

Son described the decision as "the most difficult one I have made in my career" as he spoke to media alongside new manager Thomas Frank.

"I came to north London as a kid - a very young age, a young boy came to London who even didn't speak English," Son said.

"Leaving this club as a grown man is a very, very proud moment."

Tottenham are in Seoul as part of their pre-season preparations, with Son set to start and skipper the side against Newcastle in their friendly on Sunday - meaning his final appearance for the club could come in his home country.

Frank, who replaced Ange Postecoglou as head coach in June, described Son as "a true Spurs legend" and "one of the greatest players to play in the Premier League".

"If that is the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it here in front of his home fans," Frank said.

"It could be a beautiful ending."

Tottenham also face Paris St-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup on 13 August, but Son may depart by then.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Ellie Kildunne scored two stunning tries in the semi-final win over France

Full-back Ellie Kildunne says England will "trust the process" they have been on for the past three years when they face Canada in the World Cup final.

Kildunne - who started the defeat by New Zealand in the 2022 showpiece - scored two tries in Saturday's 35-17 semi-final win over France.

Next Saturday's sell-out at Twickenham will be the Red Roses' seventh consecutive World Cup final, with their only victory coming against Canada in 2014.

However, Kildunne - who was named world player of the year last December - does not expect England to dwell on their loss in the final at Eden Park three years ago.

"It is a different tournament, we are a different team and we're up against a different opposition," said the 26-year-old.

"It is a World Cup final and you do not prepare for a World Cup final in the last week - you prepare over the last three years. There is nothing more we can do to be prepared.

"Everyone wants to be in that spot and now we are there. Everything that we have done and everything that we have learned has led to this point."

A big part of this England team is its togetherness - and that perhaps comes from the players' teenage days.

Several of the squad, including Kildunne and captain Zoe Aldcroft, attended 'Block 16' - part of the student accommodation at Hartpury University and College - on their way to becoming international regulars.

The women's rugby academy is a talent factory, taking in 16-year-olds from around the country and turning out Red Roses, creating a squad bonded by their history.

"The environment is incredible," said Kildunne. "We back each other and there is a bond in the team like no environment or team I've ever been a part of. 

"There is no-one else I would rather take the pitch with than this England team. 

"We have just got to back ourselves, trust the process that we have been on and trust that when that whistle goes, whatever is going to happen is going to happen."

A try in each half from Kildunne helped England survive a scare in the semi-final.

On both occasions, the full-back sliced her way through the French defence  and was able to dive over.

Her explanation? Avoiding the opposition at all costs. 

"There is no secret in being in a good team. Also, I do not like being tackled. So I run away from people," she said.

"I am part of a very, very good team and it's people who put me in gaps. If the gap is not there, I'll put someone else into it.

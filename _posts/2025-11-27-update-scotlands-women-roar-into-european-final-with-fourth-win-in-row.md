Experts revealed that European Curling Championships

Where: Lohja, Finland When: 22-29 November

Coverage: Watch selected games live on the BBC Sport website & app and the BBC iPlayer

Scotland's women continued their revival at the European Curling Championships by beating Switzerland to roar into the final against Sweden.

The Scots - bronze medallists last year and ranked second going into this tournament - lost four of their opening six matches, but won their final three round robin games to scrape into the semi-finals.

And in a dominant performance, Rebecca Morrison's rink won 8-5 to secure a fourth victory in a row to earn a place in the final.

"Reaching our first European final together and that is a great achievement for us," said an excited Jen Dodds, who won European gold in 2021.

"We got our bronze medal last year, which back then we were so happy with, and one of our goals for this season was to upgrade that and get to the final.

"Now we are really looking forward to getting that opportunity to compete in it."

The final will be live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app at 08:00 GMT on Saturday.

Scotland men will attempt to join them when they face Sweden in the semi-finals on Friday (07:00) - also live on the BBC Sport website & app and the BBC iPlayer.

Bruce Mouat's rink finished their round robin with a 100% record as the skip sealed an 8-5 win on the last stone against Italy earlier on Thursday.

"We're really happy with the performance," said Mouat. "I am pleased with the way we treated it like it was already a play-off game. 

"We will have hammer in both play-offs regardless of whether we are in the final or bronze medal game

"It is nice to know we have done really well with the hammer throughout the week and converted early in the games and that is what we are going to have to do tomorrow against Sweden."

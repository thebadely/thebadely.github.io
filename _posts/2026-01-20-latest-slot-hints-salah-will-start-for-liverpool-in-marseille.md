Experts revealed that Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 12 games under Arne Slot

Arne Slot has suggested Mohamed Salah will return to the Liverpool starting line-up against Marseille in Wednesday's Champions League tie, insisting his relationship with the forward is "as normal as it's always been".

Salah last started for Liverpool in the 4-1 home defeat by PSV Eindhoven in November, but scored four goals at the Africa Cup of Nations where his Egypt side finished fourth.

The 33-year-old gave an exposive interview shortly before departing for Afcon, in which he claimed "someone doesn't want me in the club" and he no longer had any relationship with Slot after being dropped.

Asked if he had a chance to reflect on the situation with Salah after the events in December, Slot said: "There's been a moment in the season where I decided not to play Mo. 

"And one moment where I decided not to take him to the game [against Inter Milan]. For all the other games, he's been in the squad and he was the first substitution against Brighton so, at that moment of time, there's never been an issue for me.

"The first time he's able to be in the squad again, he is because he trained today and is in the squad for tomorrow. Let's see the line-up tomorrow if you still think there's an issue."

Slot's side have been unbeaten during Salah's time in Morocco, but the Dutchman admitted he was "happy" to have Liverpool's record Champions League goalscorer available again.

"I am really happy and pleased he is back," added Slot. "In his absence I think we have done quite OK in terms of hardly conceding any chances and starting to create more and more.

"If you create more and more, then it is really helpful to have Mohamed Salah. There has only been one who scored more for this club [who is alive] but I don't think I can play Ian Rush still! Then it is really helpful to have him back."

Asked about his relationship with Salah, he said: "It's as normal as it's always been, with one exception and that was Inter Milan. 

"I spoke to him today and I'm happy to have him back because this season I've only had two wingers who've played more than 100 minutes in the Premier League and that's Mo and Cody [Gakpo].

"Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz can also play in these positions, but if I asked Florian what was his favourite position he wouldn't say left or right wing. Jeremie would be the same, but he's shown what he can do off the right side.

"I saw today that Mo has 45 goals for Liverpool in the Champions League and the next highest is Virgil van Dijk with five. So it is nice to have him back, especially if he is able to reach those levels that brought him 45 goals again."

Liverpool have taken a 20-man squad to Marseille, with Ibrahima Konate not in the touring party due to a family matter. 

The game against Robert de Zerbi's side will influence their hopes of finishing in the top eight and avoiding two extra ties in the knockout phase play-offs next month. The Reds host Qarabag in their final game in the group phase on Wednesday, 28 January.

During his press conference at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille, Slot was bizarrely asked about rumours linking Xabi Alonso to Liverpool, following the Spaniard's departure as Real Madrid boss last week.

"Yes, he called me and said, what do you think about the team because I am going to take over in six months, can you tell me a little bit more?" joked Slot. 

"Or maybe earlier, maybe he takes over tomorrow. No, this is one of the weirdest questions I ever got. What is there I say?

"I am working here for a little bit more than one and a half years and I really like my work over here. We won the [Premier] League last season, struggled more in the league this season. That is also obvious so yes what is there left to say?

"On the boos [at Anfield in the 1-1 draw against Burnley]? Maybe I heard a few but it wasn't as if it was a lot. I also think it's completely normal that if you draw at home to Burnley that no-one is happy about that.

"But I think the moment the people went home, when emotions calmed down, they probably thought in the one and a half years I have been at Liverpool, we have never created so many chances against a low block as we did in that game.

"Maybe it was a little bit more positive than the result showed but we are in a results business and I know that."

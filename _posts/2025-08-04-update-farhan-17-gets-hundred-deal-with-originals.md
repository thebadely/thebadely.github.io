Experts revealed that Highly-rated spinner Farhan Ahmed has played 14 first-class matches for Nottinghamshire and played for England Under-19s earlier this year

Seventeen-year-old off-spinner Farhan Ahmed, the younger brother of England international Rehan, has been signed as a late replacement for Manchester Originals in The Hundred.

Farhan replaces Gloucestershire left-arm quick Marchant de Lange while the Originals have also signed New Zealand batter Mark Chapman as cover for four games while his international team-mate Rachin Ravindra is on Black Caps duty.

West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein has been signed by Trent Rockets for two games while George Linde is away with South Africa.

Pakistan left-armer Mohammad Amir will replace Ben Dwarshuis at Northern Superchargers for the entire competition, with the Australian on international duty.

In the women's competition, uncapped Australian all-rounder Charli Knott has replaced Deepti Sharma at London Spirit for the full competition, which begins on Tuesday.

Organisers have also confirmed the availability for some of England men's Test players for the competition.

Jacob Bethell and Ben Duckett (both Birmingham Phoenix); Liam Dawson, Jamie Overton (London Spirit); Harry Brook, Zak Crawley (Northern Superchargers), and Sam Cook and Joe Root (Trent Rockets) will be available for the duration.

England vice-captain Ollie Pope will miss Spirit's first two games and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith their opener against Oval Invincibles on Tuesday. Chris Woakes has been ruled out entirely with his shoulder injury.

The availability of bowlers Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse and Josh Tongue's will be confirmed in due course.

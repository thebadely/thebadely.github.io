Here’s what you need to know: Zhao Xintong became the first player from China to win the World Championship earlier this year

China's Zhao Xintong booked his place in the semi-finals of the Champion of Champions tournament with a 6-5 win over Kyren Wilson in a thrilling match which went down to a black-ball decider.

Zhao had been 3-1 up but the Englishman roared back by winning the next four frames including breaks of 104 and 120.

World champion Zhao then won the next two frames - compiling his first century break - to square a topsy-turvy match at 5-5.

A break of 58 gave Zhao the upper hand in the deciding frame at Leicester's Mattioli Arena, but a run of 54 by Wilson ensured whoever potted the black would win.

An effort from Wilson rattled the jaws of both corner pockets and Zhao sunk a more straightforward opportunity to seal victory.

"When I was 3-1 up I missed a few shots and he came out to go 5-3 and I was just thinking I don't him to win so easy," he told ITV.

"I was a little lucky in the last two frames and got away with a couple of misses."

Zhao will now face world number Judd Trump in the last four of the 16-player invitational tournament, which is a non-ranking event.

The 28-year-old had earlier breezed through his opening match with a 4-0 win over Mark Allen.

Northern Ireland's Allen won just a solitary point in four frames as Zhao made breaks of 60, 78 and 76 en route to victory.

Wilson had progressed after a 4-3 win over fellow Englishman Jack Lisowski in a close encounter.

Lisowski had fought back from 3-0 down to level the match, only for Wilson to peel off a break of 122 to clinch the success.

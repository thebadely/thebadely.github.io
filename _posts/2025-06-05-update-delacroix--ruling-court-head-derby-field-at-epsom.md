According to new developments, Delacroix won both his runs at Leopardstown this year

Betfred Derby 2025

Venue: Epsom Racecourse Date: Saturday, 7 June Time: 15:30 BST

Coverage: Commentary of the Derby on BBC Radio 5 Live, plus Friday's Coronation Cup (14:40) and Oaks (16:00). Racecards, results & reports on the BBC Sport website and app.

Delacroix and Ruling Court head the runners in a field of 19 set to contest Saturday's Derby at Epsom.

Ryan Moore will ride Delacroix, one of three contenders - alongside The Lion In Winter and Lambourn - for Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien, who is seeking a record-extending 11th win in the race.

Ruling Court, for Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby, will bid to become the first 2,000 Guineas victor to win the Derby since Camelot in 2012.

Appleby and jockey William Buick team up on Friday with 1,000 Guineas winner Desert Flower in the Oaks, the fillies' Classic.

The going on the eve of the two-day meeting was described as good, good to soft in places after rain on Thursday.

Dante Stakes winner Pride Of Arras is one of two Derby entries for Ralph Beckett, who also has Stanhope Gardens, although the pair have been drawn 16 and two - two stalls that have never produced the winner.

John and Thady Gosden run York runner-up Damysus and the fifth-placed Nightwalker in the biggest Derby line-up for 22 years.

Declarations closed at the 72-hour stage for the first time this year after being brought forward a day in an effort to provide greater build-up for the race, which is for three-year-old horses only.

Approximate Derby odds: 7-2 Delacroix, 7-2 Ruling Court, 5-1 Pride Of Arras, 7-1 The Lion In Winter, 10-1 Lambourn, 12-1 Damysus, 16-1 Midak, Stanhope Gardens, 25-1 Bar.

Epsom Derby start time, horses and previous winners

Ruling Court wins 2000 Guineas at Newmarket

Delacroix was installed as ante-post favourite after winning two Derby trials at Leopardstown and was the pick of stable jockey Moore.

Colin Keane will partner The Lion In Winter, who was sixth when odds-on favourite in the Dante, and is expected to improve for that run although has been drawn widest of all in 19.

Stablemate Lambourn, the Chester Vase winner, will break from 10 - where 11 previous winners have started since stalls were introduced in 1967.

Buick will partner Ruling Court from stall seven for Appleby while Tornado Alert, fourth in the 2,000 Guineas, represents fellow Godolphin trainer Saeed bin Suroor.

As well as Nightwalker, owners Juddmonte have added French challenger New Ground to the Â£1.5m race for a supplementary fee of Â£75,000.

The Francis Graffard-trained Midak has also been added to the race and he will carry the colours of the Aga Khan Studs, with the race run in honour of the Aga Khan IV, who owned legendary Derby winner Shergar and died in February.

Charlie Johnston is double-handed with Lazy Griff and Green Storm, with Al Wasl Storm, Nightime Dancer, Rogue Impact, Sea Scout, Tennessee Stud and Tuscan Hills completing the field.

Approximate Oaks odds (Friday 16:00 BST): 13-8 Desert Flower, 9-2 Minnie Hauk, 5-1 Whirl, 9 -1 Giselle, Revoir, Elwateen, 16-1 Bar.

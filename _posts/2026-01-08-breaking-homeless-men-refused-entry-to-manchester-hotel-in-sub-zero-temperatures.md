Let's dive into the details: Two men were told they could not stay in their pre-booked rooms at a city centre hotel after being identified as homeless - on a night when temperatures plunged to -6C (21.2F).

Despite the rooms being paid for by a charity, the men were told by staff at the Holiday Inn Express on Oxford Road, Manchester, it did not "allow" homeless people to stay there.

The rooms were booked by charity Two Brews but, despite volunteer Amanda Thompson accompanying the men to the hotel, she said the group were told "the hotel won't allow them, it's the company's policy".

A Holiday Inn Express Manchester spokesperson has since apologised, saying the incident was "not in keeping with our policy of welcoming all".

"After speaking with team members, we recognise that this incident is not in keeping with our policy of welcoming all and should have been handled differently," they added. 

The spokesperson said the hotel was "taking steps internally to strengthen our training".

The incident, which was filmed by a charity volunteer and shared on social media, happened on Monday evening.

The men were later able to check-in to a Travelodge hotel in Moss Side.

In the footage, the men can be heard telling the receptionist that, "it is -6 degrees outside", adding "they just want to get their heads down".

The staff member told the men it was "company policy" and not "his personal views". 

"I'm not going to lie to you, I won't be able to check you in. Full truth and transparency I know you are from the street and the hotel won't allow it," he added.

Amanda Thompson from the Two Brews charity, who made the booking, said it was "disgusting" to turn the two men away.

"It's inhumane and discrimination by appearance," she said.

She said: "What happened to being kind to each other?"    

The volunteer at the charity, set up in 2020 to support homeless people and rough sleepers, said she paid £51.50 for each room with donations from a friend as well as a £50 deposit to cover any damage. 

"I booked the Holiday Inn Express on Oxford Road because one of the men has a bad foot and it was the nearest one," she said.

She said she ended up getting the pair into a Travelodge, where staff are "amazingly supportive" of the charity.

Scorecard

Orla Prendergast hit an unbeaten 67 as Ireland secured a two-game sweep in their one-day international series against Zimbabwe at Stormont.

Following a 97-run victory at the Belfast venue on Saturday, as well as a 3-0 win in the T20 series earlier this month, the hosts won by four wickets on Monday. 

Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat but lost their first three wickets for 38.

Alana Dalzell bowled opener Kelis Ndlovu for a first-ball duck before getting Loreen Tshuma to edge to wicketkeeper Amy Hunter for just four.

When Chiedza Dhururu was trapped lbw by Ava Canning, the tourists' innings looked to be teetering on the brink of collapse.

Captain Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano steadied the ship with 56 from 92 balls, while Modester Mupachikwa chipped in with 45 to set Ireland a target of 178. 

While Ireland lost an early wicket of their own, with Sarah Forbes caught by Biza off the bowling of Chigora for only three, captain Gaby Lewis provided 44 off 59 balls.

Mupachikwa stumped her fellow wicketkeeper Amy Hunter for just 14 but what felt at the time like a potentially key wicket instead brought Prendergast to the crease.

Her 67 included seven boundaries and marked her second consecutive half-century in the one-day format as Ireland eased to victory in the 39th over. 

Ireland return to action in a three-game T20 series against Pakistan in Dublin next month.

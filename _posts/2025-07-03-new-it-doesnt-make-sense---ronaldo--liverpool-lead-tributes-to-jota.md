According to new developments, Diogo Jota played for clubs including Atletico Madrid, Porto, Wolves and Liverpool

Liverpool say they are "devastated" by the "unimaginable loss" of forward Diogo Jota, who has died in a car crash aged 28.

The Portugal international and his brother Andre Silva, 25, were killed after their car left the road because of a tyre blowout in the Spanish province of Zamora.

Jota married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children, just last month.

Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who played alongside Jota, wrote on social media: "It doesn't make sense. Just now we were together in the national team, you had just got married."

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo sent his condolences to Jota's family, wife and children, and added: "I know you will always be with them. Rest in Peace, Diogo e Andre. We will miss you."

Liverpool said in their statement they were "devastated by the tragic passing of Diogo Jota".

The club added: "Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre's family, friends, team-mates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss."

Jurgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager who signed Jota for the Reds, said he was "heartbroken".

"This is a moment where I struggle. There must be a bigger purpose. But I can't see it," the German coach posted on Instagram.

"Diogo was not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father. We will miss you so much."

Liverpool have opened physical and digital books of condolence. Supporters and members of the public can sign the physical book at Anfield, external from Thursday to Sunday.

Jota, who joined Liverpool in 2020 from Wolves, won the Premier League last season and was also part of the team that won the FA Cup and League Cup in 2021-22.

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) said he was "much more than an amazing player".

"Jota was an extraordinary person, respected by all team-mates and opponents, someone with an infectious joy and a reference in the community itself," the FPF said.

"We have lost two champions. The passing of Diogo and Andre represents irreparable losses for Portuguese football, and we will do everything to honour their legacy daily."

Uefa announced a moment of silence would be observed at all Women's European Championship games on Thursday and Friday, including Portugal's tie against Spain.

Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football's governing body, said: "Just three weeks ago, I had the honour of presenting Jota with a medal after the Nations League final - a moment of joy, pride, and celebration that will now forever be burned in memory with sorrow."

In a post on world football's governing body Fifa's X account, president Gianni Infantino said Jota and Andre Silva will both be "so sorely missed by all those who knew them and by the worldwide football community".

"Aged just 28, Diogo had enjoyed a fantastic career to date and had many great years ahead of him, while his brother Andre was thriving at Penafiel."

"I can only imagine how his team-mates feel at Liverpool and Portugal, they must be in a world of pain with his friends and family," Carragher told Sky Sports.

"It just shows us all how quickly life can change. What a summer he's had, and you get this devastating news that his family have had in the last few hours. You can't even comprehend it."

Former England and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard posted on Instagram: "RIP Diogo. Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time."

"May you and your brother find the peace you need to watch over your loved ones who lost you too soon and suddenly. My condolences to all your family."

Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live: "You saw the smile on his face when he played. He was always that bubbly character, but he was also a fiery person on the pitch. He had that lovely balance.

"He was always happy to give up his time, more than gracious when he spoke to people, very respectful but also a very charismatic character. I don't think you become a fans' favourite without being that type of person."

The Premier League said football had "lost a champion who will be forever missed", adding it would "continue to support our friends and colleagues at the club".

Wolves, where Jota spent three seasons, said they were "heartbroken" and that their former player would be "truly missed, and always remembered".

"Diogo was adored by our fans, loved by his team-mates and cherished by everyone who worked with him during his time at Wolves," they added.

"The memories he created will never be forgotten."

Manchester United said their "deepest condolences are with the loved ones of Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre, and everyone connected with Liverpool", while Everton said they were "deeply saddened by the tragic passing" of the brothers.

Jota joined Atletico Madrid in 2016, and spent the 2016-17 season on loan with Porto, where his brother was also a youth player.

Porto said they were "in mourning". Andre Villas-Boas, the former Chelsea and Spurs manager who is now president of the Portuguese club, added: "This is a moment of profound dismay for the entire Porto fanbase and for all Portuguese people.

"Two young men tragically lost their lives, two men who represented FC Porto in an exemplary manner and who will be remembered not only for their football but also for their personal and human qualities."

Porto's rivals Sporting said "the world of football has become poorer".

Pacos de Ferreira, the Portuguese club where Jota began his professional career and his brother also was a player, said the siblings left their mark on the club. 

"They were two extraordinary people who stood out for their humility, responsibility and immense dedication to the club they played for," the club said.

Portuguese second division club Penafiel, where Andre Silva played for the past two seasons as a forward, said: "The loss of two lives so young and linked to the world of football fills us with pain and consternation."

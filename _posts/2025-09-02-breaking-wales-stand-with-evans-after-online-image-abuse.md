Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Georgia Evans (centre) with her trademark pink bows

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Wales v Fiji

Venue: Sandy Park, Exeter Date: Saturday, 6 September Kick-off: 14:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport online and app, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and BBC Sounds

Wales players have stood by team-mate Georgia Evans after her appearance was criticised online during the Rugby World Cup.

The number eight has long sported bows in her hair, but a promotional image on BBC social media before Saturday's defeat by Canada drew a raft of negative comments.

Evans posted on her own social media on Monday saying it was "the first and most likely the last time" that she would speak out about it.

"The bows in my hair, the tape around my arm, the eye lashes and full face of make-up that I choose to wear has no bearing on my ability, my passion or fight for this game," she said.

Wales wing Lisa Neumann also posted some screenshots of abuse that she had received after winning her 50th cap against Scotland.

Wales prop Sisilia Tuipulotu, fly-half Kayleigh Powell and full-back Nel Metcalfe all spoke in support of Evans' actions at Tuesday's media conference.

"I don't think anyone should change who they are on or off the field - if that's their personality, that's who they are, I'm not going to judge them," said Tuipulotu,

"Georgia is a class player, so it doesn't matter if she has a bow in her hair or make-up on her face - she shows what she can do on the field and that's all that matters.

"I don't think people see how much what they say can affect a person."

Powell said: "I 100% support the girls speaking out about it, because I guess if you don't talk about it, it doesn't get fixed - but then also are we giving them [the online abusers] the attention they want? It's a hard one.

"For me, it just makes me really sad that people feel that's what they want to do, rather than just support the game. If you're not interested, just don't say anything."

Metcalfe said: "I don't know how some people can be so cruel - type a message out and think that's OK to send to someone.

"At the end of the day we're all people and it's not acceptable at all, so we stand with both Georgia and Lisa and hopefully they're both OK."

Fans can expect to see more bows on the field in a show of solidarity on Saturday when Wales play their final Pool B game against Fiji.

And with their tournament exit already confirmed, Wales will be looking to prove a point on and off the pitch.

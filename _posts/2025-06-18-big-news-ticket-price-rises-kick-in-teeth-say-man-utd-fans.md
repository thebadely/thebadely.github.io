Experts revealed that Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League last season - their worst domestic campaign for more than 50 years

Manchester United fans have accused the club of giving fans a "kick in the teeth" after announcing matchday ticket prices could reach Â£97.

The most expensive matchday tickets at Old Trafford last season were Â£66.

And this follows their worst domestic campaign since the 1973-74 season, when the club were relegated.

Despite finishing 15th last season, the club are for the first time introducing price categories for the approximately 20,000 tickets available for each game.

There are four categories, with the lowest reserved exclusively for "some" cup games.

It means the lowest priced ticket for a Premier League game is Â£37, for the two category C matches against Sunderland and Wolves. That figure rises to Â£97 for the highest priced tickets in category A, which involves games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham.

Club officials argue the Â£97 applies to less than 1% of the available tickets.

Last season, matchday ticket prices for Premier League games at Old Trafford began at Â£40. But that policy was changed in mid-season to a flat Â£66, with no concessions for tickets not already sold. It meant Â£66 was the highest price charged for a matchday ticket.

United sources say the new prices were lower than originally planned following discussion with supporters.

However, the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) reject completely the idea there was any kind of consultation involved and expressed their dismay at United's announcement.

"After how last season went, we might have hoped the club would reconsider their plans for this new ticketing model which will see eye-watering price increases for supporters who buy tickets on a match-by-match basis," said MUST.

"This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans.

"When the club said they were introducing this new model, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games and reduce prices for lower demand games.

"Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans' representative bodies on the details of the decision and once again they're making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the club as a whole.

"What Manchester United needs next season is a united fanbase and club, with the team on the pitch supported by loyal and vocal fans roaring it back after the disaster that was last year.

"This match categorisation model will do enormous harm and undermine the atmosphere in the ground in a season when the team will need it more than ever."

After the final match of last season, head coach Ruben Amorim called for fans to "stick together" with the club if they were to move forward.

And in a wide-ranging interview with United We Stand published on Wednesday, United chief executive Omar Berrada said the rollout of the Â£66 decision, which was subsequently reversed, was "not good".

However, club officials are adamant raising revenue through ticket prices is an essential part of balancing finances and said categorisation of games is a practice implemented by virtually all their Premier League rivals.

According to the Football Fancast, external website, four clubs had a larger highest ticket price last season than United are planning next, with Fulham at the top of the list on Â£160.

It has been recently reported that Felix Cash is 16-1 in his pro career, having made his debut in 2016

Former British and Commonwealth middleweight champion Felix Cash says becoming a father helped him tackle long-term struggles with alcohol and substance abuse.

Cash has not fought since a fifth-round stoppage defeat by Tyler Denny in Birmingham in the summer of 2024 - his first professional loss - but is now eyeing a comeback.

The 32-year-old from Berkshire was not sure if he would ever fight again after a turbulent few years outside the ring, but feels he is "refreshed and focused" following six months of sobriety and the arrival of another child.

"I'd been trying to give up drinking and going on mad benders for maybe six or seven years," he told BBC Sport.

"It was getting worse, but having my new baby boy has changed everything.

"If I'd carried on the way I was, I wasn't going to last much longer - I'd either have been locked up or dead."

Cash first made his name in 2021, winning the British middleweight title with a devastating third-round knockout of Denzel Bentley at York Hall.

But long periods of inactivity over the past three years saw his momentum stall.

"Now I've had time to reflect. I'm happy to be back doing what I love and I've been sober for six months," he added.

Defeat against Tyler Denny was Cash's first loss after wins over Denzel Bentley and Jack Cullen

Cash's defeat by Denny was seen as a missed opportunity to move on to the European stage.

The fight was stopped in the fifth round after an accidental clash of heads caused a cut to Cash, and Denny went on to win on the scorecards.

"I should never have been in the ring that night," Cash added.

"Mentally, I wasn't right. But if it hadn't been stopped on a cut I believe I would have beaten him.

"Fair play to him, but if I'd been in the place I'm in now I'd have beaten 10 of him in one night."

Denny's victory earned him a high-profile fight with Hamzah Sheeraz at Wembley Stadium, but Cash says he is now ready to reclaim his place among Britain's best middleweights.

Cash is yet to confirm a return date but is exploring options with several promoters.

He has previously worked with Tony Sims and Adam Booth but has now linked up with Southampton-based trainer Jacob MacMillan, who also coaches British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight champion Lewis Edmondson.

"I'm enjoying boxing again," Cash said. "Working with Jacob, we clicked straight away.

"When I come back, I've got a point to prove. I know what I can do and I want to show everyone that I'm the real deal."

Cash added that he has spoken to promotional outfits Matchroom, Queensberry and Boxxer as he looks to decide the best route for his return.

"I'll talk to everyone and see what the best route is for me," he said . "It's time to get the show back on the road."

Let's dive into the details: Daniel Dubois is the underdog against the unbeaten Oleksandr Usyk

Daniel Dubois has the chance to exact revenge on Oleksandr Usyk when they meet again at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.

The 27-year-old Londoner will aim to do what Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua could not and end the Ukrainian's unbeaten record.

Usyk is aiming to be a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion, while Dubois is bidding to become the first Briton to achieve the feat since Lennox Lewis in 1999.

But can he succeed where his compatriots have failed or will the 38-year-old Usyk reaffirm his position as this generation's greatest heavyweight?

Everything you need to know about the event is below.

Live text commentary will begin from 20:00 BST on the BBC Sport website and app.

You will be able to follow some of the undercard, including the co-main event between Lawrence Okolie and Kevin Lerena.

BBC Sport will bring you daily coverage from London in fight week, with Steve Bunce delivering episodes of his 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce podcast.

As with all the Wembley events, expect a slightly earlier ringwalk time because of the stadium's 23:00 BST curfew.

The first event is scheduled for 17:40.

Usyk and Dubois will make their ringwalk around 21:50. 

Oleksandr Usyk v Daniel Dubois 2 - WBA (Super), WBO, IBF and WBC heavyweight world titles

Daniel Lapin v Lewis Edmondson - light-heavyweight

Aadam Hamed v Ezequiel Gregores - light-welterweight

Lasha Guruli v James Francis - light-welterweight

Vladyslav Sirenko v Solomon Dacres - heavyweight

This one is for all the marbles. Dubois is the IBF heavyweight world champion, while Usyk holds the WBA (Super), WBC and WBO world titles as well as the Ring Magazine belt.

The winner walks away as the undisputed heavyweight champion.

Lewis was the last British undisputed heavyweight champion in 1999, while no Briton has ever held the undisputed title in the four-belt era.

Wednesday - open workouts from 16:00 BST

Boxpark in Wembley hosts all the fighters.

Thursday - news conference from 13:00 BST

Dubois and Usyk will have the chance to say their final piece.

Friday - weigh-in from 15:00 BST

The public can attend the weigh-in at Boxpark in Wembley. The final face-off will happen after each fighter weighs in.

Dubois has never contested a rematch, while Usyk has won the two he has been involved with

Usyk has the more impressive resume with wins over Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua at heavyweight and a second over Dubois will see the Ukrainian beat the best Britain has to offer, twice.

A two-weight undisputed champion, Usyk has 23 wins and 14 knockouts. He has relied on his speed, footwork and technique as the often smaller man at heavyweight.

Former cruiserweight world champion Usyk has yet to be officially dropped at this weight, but Dubois will be hopeful his opponent might be slowing down at 38. 

This will be the Briton's first rematch and, while he relies heavily on his knockout power, his style has not changed significantly since their first encounter in 2023 when he was knocked out in the ninth round.

That was the second loss of his career, the other one coming against Joe Joyce in 2020. 

The Englishman has three wins since then, taking his tally to 22 in 24 contests, all by stoppage and including against Joshua last September.

Power is, on paper, a clear advantage for Dubois. He has a 95% stoppage rate in his wins compared to Usyk's 61%.

Size and height is another advantage, although Dubois was unable to make those margins count in their first meeting.

The first encounter between Usyk and Dubois was in Wroclaw, Poland, in August 2023.

It was a fight not many gave Dubois a hope of winning, but he floored the reigning champion in the fifth round.

The referee, though, immediately called a low blow and Usyk was controversially given time to recover. The Ukrainian had the mostly partisan crowd on his side, but Dubois' team at ringside were furious with the decision.

The call is still being debated and was a major talking point at the announcement news conference.

Once the fight resumed, Usyk quickly went to work, slowly chipping away at Dubois' energy reserves.

By the eighth round the Briton looked exhausted and frustrated when he tried to fend off a flurry of shots. He hit the canvas, managed to get to his feet, but was then dropped again in the ninth round and couldn't beat the referee's count.

Aside from the controversy over the low blow, Usyk was the better fighter with a more controlled display. He landed more shots, 88 to 47, and was the more accurate puncher with 25% landing compared to 16% for his opponent.

But will Dubois target the body more in the rematch to come out on top?

Experts revealed that Glenn Irwin began the third BSB round at Snetterton in second place in the championship standings

Glenn Irwin suffered fractures to his hip socket and pelvis after crashing during a free practice session at the third round of the British Superbike Championship at Snetterton on Saturday.

The Northern Ireland rider came off his Hager PBM Ducati at Turn Nine during FP3 and the session was subsequently red-flagged.

After initially being taken to the circuit medical centre for x-rays on his hip and right leg, the 35-year-old was then transported to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for further scans and assessment.

A statement issued by BSB race organisers later on Saturday explained the extent of his injuries.

"Following a CT scan at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Glenn Irwin has been found to have fractures to his hip socket and pelvis. He is in stable condition," they revealed.

"Glenn will be reviewed tomorrow by the specialist team to decide an ongoing management plan."

Irwin was ruled out of Saturday's opening BSB race of the weekend, which was won by series leader, Yamaha rider Bradley Ray.

Ray took his fifth win of the season, with defending champion Kyle Ryde second, Honda Racing's Tommy Bridewell completing the podium positions and Leon Haslam fourth.

Ray now leads the championship standings with 104 points, followed by Ryde on 82, Haslam on 77 and Irwin on 74.

Irwin's brother Andrew crashed out on lap four of the weekend opener while challenging for a top-12 spot.

Two further races are scheduled for Sunday.

Glenn Irwin had secured four podium finishes from the first five races of the season at Oulton Park and Donington to occupy second in the series ahead of this weekend's action.

From Carrickfergus in county Antrim, is an 11-time Superbike race winner at the North West 200 international road races, but called it quits on that branch of the sport before this year's event.

Meanwhile, Dubliner Jack Kennedy won the 10-lap Supersport sprint race for Honda Racing on Saturday, from Donegal's Rhys Irwin, with Fermanagh native Lee Johnston fifth.

Let's dive into the details: It isn't the traditional Boxing Day card in the Scottish Premiership this season, but the 27 December fixture list is still one to look forward to, with significant matches at the top and bottom of the division.

Hibernian welcome Edinburgh rivals Hearts to Easter Road in Saturday's early kick-off, defending champions Celtic go to bottom club Livingston, while it's fourth v third at Ibrox as Rangers host Motherwell.

Struggling Kilmarnock travel to Paisley to face St Mirren, Dundee host Falkirk and Aberdeen take on Dundee United in the late kick-off.

Here are some key things to watch out for.

'Always the main deal' - Hibs & Hearts primed for 'special' derby

Celtic signings need 'personality' - Nancy

Rohl wants more from Rangers midfielder Raskin

Craig Halkett's injury-time goal earned Hearts all three points in the first Edinburgh derby of the season

Rangers' match against Motherwell certainly catches the eye, but Saturday's standout fixture is undoubtedly the Edinburgh derby - 150 years and two days on from the first meeting of the sides.

Hearts have the opportunity to strengthen their grip on top spot and could go nine points clear if they win and Livingston shock Celtic at Almondvale.

Regardless of events in West Lothian, Hearts boss Derek McInnes knows a win would provide further momentum to take into 2026 after victories against both Old Firm sides this month.

They have favourable fixtures in the new year against bottom-half sides Livingston, Dundee and St Mirren before a mouth-watering match at Tynecastle against Celtic on 25 January.

For Hibs, not only is there the tantalising prospect of stalling Hearts' title challenge, but also the knowledge that three points could take them within one point of Rangers in fourth.

It was a tightly fought contest in the first Edinburgh derby of the season back in October, but Hearts defender Craig Halkett scored the only goal in the 91st minute,  volleying home Sabah Kerjota's cross.

No player in the Premiership has created more chances from open play (26) than Celtic midfielder Reo Hatate this season, while only Hearts winger Alexandros Kyziridis (3.9) has a higher expected assists from open play total than the Japan international (3.2).

Having missed Celtic's win over Aberdeen last time out because of illness, Hatate is expected to be involved for the trip to Livingston.

He has played a prominent role under new manager Wilfried Nancy, starting four of the Frenchman's five matches in charge as one of two number 10s in his much-discussed 3-4-3 formation. 

Despite losses in all four of those games, Hatate showed he was able to slot into the new system, scoring in the Premier Sports Cup final defeat by St Mirren and creating chances in all three league matches.

Hatate has consistently been one of Celtic's standout performers since signing from Kawasaki Frontale in January 2022 and raw statistics show he continues to be central to their attacking play.

If Nancy is to build on his first win as Celtic boss and keep pace with Hearts, he will need Hatate to maintain his excellent creative output.

Jens Berthel Askou's Motherwell are unbeaten in their past 10 Premiership outings

Motherwell have arguably been the best team to watch in the Premiership this season and are unquestionably the team punching most above their weight in Scotland's top flight. 

Manager Jens Berthel Askou has implemented an eye-catching possession-based style since joining in the summer, a feat several coaches have failed to do with far bigger budgets.

Elliot Watt has been a revelation in midfield, Elijah Just has slotted in seamlessly having worked under Askou previously at Danish club Horsens, while only Hearts captain Lawrence Shankland has scored more goals in the Premiership than Tawanda Maswanhise this season.

It is at the back though that perhaps the most impressive aspect of Askou's set-up has been.

Motherwell are unbeaten in their past 10 league outings and haven't conceded in over a month with six straight clean sheets.

They have shipped just 15 goals in the league all season, a record bettered only by Celtic and Hearts (both 14).

Research from my learned colleague Nick McPheat shows Motherwell are averaging their best defensive record in a top-flight campaign - 0.83 goals conceded per match - since the 1931â32 season, when they won the title. 

Attacks win matches, but defences win titles. A festive omen of cheer for the Steelmen and Askou before they face Rangers at Ibrox.

Given Rangers' struggles in attacking areas this term, don't be surprised if Motherwell's superb run continues into 2026.

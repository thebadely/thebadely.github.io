Experts revealed that A Scunthorpe United player and a Nottingham Forest fan are among the victims stabbed in a knife attack on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening. They are among 10 people injured on the train during the mass stabbing.

Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on a LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were attacked at around 20:00 GMT.

Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.

Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and has been operated on, his club said.

Anthony Williams, 32, has been remanded in custody following the incident and is charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident.

Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Crean's left hand could be seen heavily bandaged and he still had blood in his hair. He is one of the train passengers the 32-year-old is accused of attempting to murder.

Mr Crean described how he "tussled" with the man who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.

He said he first saw people running down the train shouting that there was a man with a knife. As people ran to the buffet car he said he wanted to make sure passengers were safe.

"I saw him coming towards me - a guy with a rucksack and he's obviously got something in there.

"Everyone's gone towards the buffet, and that is on the verge of being full up. There's no-one else getting in there. I wasn't even going to bother pushing to get in.

"There's young women and they need to get them in. I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked and I've looked around to save a bit of time.

"But then he started, he pulled this thing out. It was an over large blade thing".

Mr Crean said the man asked him: "Do you want to die? Do you want to die?" 

"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms with him and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and must have caught me on the head."

Mr Crean says it's nice to hear that people are calling him a hero but that he wasn't the only one.

"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably real heroes.

"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice."

He says he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the buffet door. 

"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it."

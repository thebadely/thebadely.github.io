Experts revealed that Millions of people  in the UK face travel disruption on busy roads and due to a rail strike and engineering weeks this bank holiday weekend.

There is likely to be significant disruption on the rail network on the CrossCountry route from Aberdeen to Cornwall because of a strike by the RMT union over pay, safety and staffing. 

The RAC has also warned roads will be busy on Friday, with three million getaway journeys planned, and particularly heavy traffic on the M5 between Bristol and Devon.

Monday is a bank holiday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Network Rail has advised all passengers to check their journeys before travelling due to the strikes and rail works.

There will be no CrossCountry services on Saturday, meaning there will be no direct trains connecting Birmingham to Leicester, Derby or Nottingham. 

On Sunday, although industrial action is not taking place, alterations and cancellations are to be expected. 

On Monday, there will be a strike, but there will be limited services on all Cross Country lines between 08:00 BST and 18:00.

Trains between Birmingham, Reading and the South Coast will not run, as well as services between Leicester, Cambridge and Stansted airport. 

There will only be a very limited service to the south west and north of York.

Meanwhile, on the East Coast Main Line, LNER will have no direct trains to London King's Cross on Sunday, with engineering projects taking place on other routes too.

On Saturday, western England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland will see sunny spells in the afternoon but also a chance of showers. Scotland will also have some sunny spells. 

Sunday will be mainly dry with spells of sunshine and a few areas of cloud, along with the chance of a light shower in the north.

Central and Southern England will be the warmest spots over the weekend, with temperatures predicted to be between 23 and 25C.

Bank Holiday Monday will be a largely dry and warm day with lots of sunshine. Rain will move into Northern Ireland in the evening.

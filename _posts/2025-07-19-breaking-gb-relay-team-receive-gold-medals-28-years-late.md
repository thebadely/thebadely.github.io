According to new developments, The 1997 Great Britain men's 4x400m relay team enjoy their golden moment

Great Britain's men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Athletics Championships have been given gold medals - 28 years later.

Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch and Mark Richardson - plus Mark Hylton, who ran in the heats - finished second to the USA at the event, which was held in Athens.

But the Americans were later stripped of the title as a result of an anti-doping violation by team member Antonio Pettigrew.

That meant the British line-up were upgraded to world champions, with Englishmen Black, Richardson and Hylton plus Welsh duo Thomas and Baulch belatedly presented with gold medals at Saturday's Diamond League meeting at a sold-out London Stadium.

"We're proud to be able to give these athletes their moment in front of a home crowd," said Cherry Alexander, UK Athletics' strategic lead for major events.

"It's a chance to recognise not just their talent, but the values they stood for. This medal means even more because of how long they've waited for it."

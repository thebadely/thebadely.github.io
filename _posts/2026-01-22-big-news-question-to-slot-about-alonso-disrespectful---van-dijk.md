It has been recently reported that Virgil van Dijk made his 350th appearance for Liverpool on Wednesday

Arne Slot being asked about rumours linking Xabi Alonso to his job as Liverpool manager was "disrespectful" said the Reds captain Virgil van Dijk.

On Tuesday a journalist asked Slot whether former Liverpool player Alonso - who earlier this month left his role as Real Madrid head coach by "mutual consent" - had been in touch.

Slot laughed off what he called "one of the weirdest questions" by joking that the Spaniard had called to say he was "going to take over in six months, or maybe earlier".

The question came on the eve of Liverpool's 3-0 victory at Marseille in the Champions League.

Liverpool did not ask the journalist who posed the Alonso question to be banned but Van Dijk was keen to call him out after the game.

"That (question) was disrespectful," said the Dutch defender.

"Criticism is justified if you look at what we are doing in the season, especially based on last season.

"It's been a difficult part of the season for us players and the manager as well but he has handled it well."

Liverpool put in one of their most "complete performances" of the season to beat Marseille according to Van Dijk who became the 50th player to reach 350 appearances for the club.

 "To play my 350th game, win 3-0 and keep a clean sheet, that's something I'm proud of," said the 34-year-old.

The Reds are in a strong position to finish in the top eight in the league phase and advance directly to the last-16 in March, thus avoiding the knockout play-off round in February.

They host Qarabag on Wednesday, 28 January knowing victory will secure them a top-four slot and a home tie in the second leg of the last-16 and, should they get that far, the quarter-final.

But Van Dijk's attention has already turned to Saturday's league game at Bournemouth.

Liverpool are unbeaten in 13 games since losing 4-1 to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on 26 November. 

But they have won just four of their 10 Premier League games, drawing the past four, to lie fourth in the table, 14 points adrift of leaders Arsenal. 

They are seven points behind third-placed Aston Villa and five teams below them are within three points, as the race for Champions League qualification heats up.

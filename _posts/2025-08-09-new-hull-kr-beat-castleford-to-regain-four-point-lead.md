Hull KR warmed up for their top-of-the-table meeting with Wigan next Friday with a comfortable win against depleted Castleford Tigers at Craven Park.

A second successive hat-trick from Joe Burgess helped the Robins take another step to their first League Leaders' Shield in the Super League era.

Jez Litten, Rhyse Martin, Mikey Lewis and Arthur Mourgue all grabbed one try each for Hull KR in a dominant 36-6 victory in the East Yorkshire sunshine.

Victory means Hull KR regain their four-point lead at the top of the Super League standings while Castleford remain 10th.

With interim Castleford boss Chris Chester only able to select a side from 18 fit players, talk of a potential thrashing was under the spotlight when Cas centre Louis Senior knocked the ball on straight from kick-off.

The visitors defended resolutely, however, and could have had the first score when captain Sam Wood's beautiful line break saw him go clear but he was unable to find teenage full-back Jenson Windley, who would have a walk-in, instead knocking-on under pressure.

Following a lacklustre opening 20 minutes, the league leaders clicked into gear when Mikey Lewis set off a move which eventually saw Burgess dive over in the corner.

When providing the assist, Lewis was caught by a late challenge from Jeremiah Simbiken, who was sent to the sin-bin and, five minutes later, the Robins made their extra man count when Jack Broadbent found Burgess who dotted down his second in the left corner.

Former Tigers man Broadbent then had his pocket picked when Alex Mellor jumped over the full-back to collect an accurate up and under from Asi before diving next to the sticks to score.

Asi added the extras to reduce Cas' deficit to four.

A smart piece of thinking from first-half replacement Litten saw him race through from dummy-half to deceive Windley and Joe Stimson to dive under the sticks for Kingston Rovers' third try.

Hull KR's victory means they also picked up the Roger Millward Trophy

Cas thought they had their second try after the break when Senior charged over past three challenges but was adjudged to have lost grip of the ball at the vital moment when attempting to ground it.

The Robins took heed of the warning sign with Cas momentarily down to 12 men when, after Wood received a green card after going down, Lewis strode forward before Martin dived over.

Burgess then raced clear to find Lewis who dotted down to effectively put the match to bed on the hour mark.

Five minutes later, sharp footwork from French halfback Mourgue saw him weave past two Tigers defenders to score before Broadbent's clever pass sent Burgess in with ease to complete his hat-trick and wrap up the scoring.

Hull KR coach Willie Peters said:

"Will that performance [against Wigan] cut it next week? It won't. We will have two teams going at it next week.

"It was a weird game. I thought we did a lot of good things. We put a lot of pressure on them. Our defence was good for the majority of the game.

"I thought overall we defended well. We suffocated Cas with our kick chase. When they asked questions there were some moments where we weren't perfect."

Castleford Tigers interim coach Chris Chester said:

"Defensively we really turned up for each other. I was really happy with the way we went in at half-time, 16-6 down. After that they just strangled us.

"We had an opportunity with Louis Senior, we [also] dropped the ball over the line against Huddersfield. We've got to ice those moments, that's the difference.

"I was proud of the way that we dealt with adversity, we lost Fletcher Rooney [to a season-ending hamstring injury before the game]. We had no idea who was going to play full-back."

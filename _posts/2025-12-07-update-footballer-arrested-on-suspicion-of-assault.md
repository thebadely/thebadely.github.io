According to new developments, The player was arrested in London in the early hours of Saturday

An international footballer has been arrested in central London on suspicion of assault and affray.

Police said an incident took place during the early hours of Saturday in the West End.

The player, 29, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of two counts of assault and one count of affray.

He cannot be named for legal reasons.

Police told BBC Sport they were called to the incident at 00:47 GMT on Saturday following reports of an assault.

The alleged victim was taken to hospital with injuries, which police said were not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening.

The player has been released on bail while police enquiries continue.

In the UK the name of someone arrested is rarely released or confirmed by police.

This approach was brought in following the Leveson Inquiry into the British media in 2012. It said arrested suspects should only be named in "exceptional and clearly identified circumstances".

Typically, a name is released if a suspect is charged.

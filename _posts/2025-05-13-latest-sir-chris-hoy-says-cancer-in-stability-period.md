According to new developments, Six-time Olympic cycling champion Hoy announced last year that his cancer is terminal

Sir Chris Hoy is appreciating life "more than ever" after being diagnosed with terminal cancer last year and says he has entered "a bit of a stability period" in his treatment.

The 49-year-old, a six-time Olympic cycling gold medallist, said in February 2024 that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.

In October, he announced his diagnosis was terminal after the primary cancer spread to his bones, with doctors giving him between two and four years to live.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Hoy issued a positive update on his health: "I'm doing well. It feels like I've entered a bit of a stability stage at the moment and I'm feeling good.

"Most importantly, cancer's not the first thing I think about when I go to bed at night. I think we've got into a rhythm now where it's part of our life and we manage that and crack on.

"I feel good. I'm on constant medication, constant treatment, but it's not interfering too much with my life, and the most important thing is it's working, so I'm stable at the moment, everything's good. Making hay while the sun shines."

The Scot won his six Olympic golds - and one silver medal - between 2000 and 2012, making him Britain's second-most decorated Olympic athlete behind Sir Jason Kenny (seven golds).

He also claimed 11 World Championship golds and 34 World Cup titles before retiring in 2013.

"I can't believe the position I'm in now compared to 18 months ago. I never imagined I'd be able to get to this point where I'm actually living life," he continued.

"And not just living life, but actually appreciating it more than ever. It's not just about doing bucket-list stuff and doing massive things, it's about appreciating the daily, mundane fun of life."

It has been recently reported that Wakefield Trinity's Tom Johnstone (centre) celebrates after scoring his side's fifth try against Warrington Wolves

Betfred Super League

Mason Lino delivered a virtuoso display as Wakefield Trinity posted the first back-to-back wins of their Super League campaign with a 40-10 victory over Warrington Wolves.

Wakefield's half-back was in unstoppable form as Trinity backed up their 32-8 Magic Weekend win over Castleford Tigers with a seven-try rout against Wire.

The 31-year-old Samoa international produced a superb display with both boot and hands, assisting in four of Wakefield's tries as they blew away the Challenge Cup finalists to go sixth in the table.

This was the first time since last season's promotion to the top flight under coach Daryl Powell that Wakefield have registered consecutive Super League victories.

Yet from the off it always seemed likely.

Prop Caius Faatili scored two tries inside the first 10 minutes - to follow up his double against the Tigers - as Wakefield went on the charge early with Max Jowitt's goals putting them 12-0 up.

A third from Josh Griffin after 27 minutes stretched Trinity's lead to 18-0 before Warrington finally flexed their muscles with Arron Lindop and Connor Wrench pulling it back to 18-10 at the break.

If Warrington had gone in with a spring in their step at half-time, it did not last long into the second period as Corey Hall barged over from four yards and Jowitt added the extras to stretch the lead out to 14 points again.

Warrington could be forgiven for tiring as the half progressed. Not only are they battling a seemingly ever-increasing injury list, but they came into this fixture against a well-rested Wakefield off the back of a battling Challenge Cup semi-final win over Leigh LeopardsÂ last Sunday.

Those tired legs definitely contributed to this scoreline as Lino pulled the strings and Wakefield piled on the misery.

His boot had set up the second of Faatili's tries and his quick hands assisted for Griffin's first, but he was the last person Warrington wanted at the helm given the assured way he dictated the direction of play in the second period.

Tom Johnstone finished in the 56th minute, and a brilliant offload inches off the turf from Mathieu Cozza put in Griffin close to the line for a second try seven minutes later.

Oli Pratt touched down 12 minutes from time with his try converted by the boot of Jowitt, who finished with six successful goals from seven attempts.

Warrington, who remain in ninth place after their sixth league defeat of the season, have much to look forward to with a Challenge Cup final against Hull KR on 7 June.

But coach Sam Burgess will be hoping the physio's table empties and they can put days like this behind them before tackling the league leaders at Wembley.

Wakefield Trinity coach Daryl Powell said:

"It's important that we are in the top six, to show we are here as a genuine team who are going to be difficult to deal with, and we can threaten anybody.

"We are constantly talking about building and growing our confidence, and we will keep our feet on the ground and keep doing what we're doing.

"There may be certain people who are getting excited about the way we're playing, but for me as a coach it is about making sure we don't get ahead of ourselves.

"I think I've got an outstanding team and we're just going to get better and better. The boys in there at the moment are doing a class job.

"We've got a proper team that just challenges everybody and we should believe in ourselves."

Warrington Wolves coach Sam Burgess said:

"We definitely looked a bit lethargic and we got beaten physically. It [last week's game] did play a part, but I still expected us to be a little bit better today.

"We understand our position in the league at the moment and we also know Wembley is coming up, so we're just compartmentalising things and taking one week at a time.

"We've got [Hull] KR on Friday so it's not getting any easier for us, and we've got to fix things up pretty quick.

"It [the injury situation] does catch up on us at times in such key positions, but we are hanging in there. The guys who have come in have done a pretty decent job, but tonight it felt like it has caught up with them."

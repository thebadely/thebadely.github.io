It has been recently reported that Aaron Ramsey has scored 21 international goals in 86 Wales appearances

International friendly: England v Wales

Venue: Wembley Stadium, London Date: Thursday, 9 October Kick off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live on S4C, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

Aaron Ramsey is an injury doubt for Wales' friendly with England on Thursday and next week's World Cup qualifier against Belgium.

The 34-year-old midfielder was left out of the Pumas UNAM side for Sunday's 2-1 Liga MX defeat against Guadalajara. 

Reports in Mexico say Ramsey - who was recalled last week by Wales boss Craig Bellamy - suffered "discomfort" during training on Thursday and was unable to take part in preparations on Friday.

The former Arsenal player has not played international football since sustaining a hamstring injury during his country's Nations League win in Montenegro in September 2024.

It is unclear whether Ramsey will return to Wales or remain in Mexico to undergo rehabilitation.

'Matter of time' until England win trophy - Bellamy

Ramsey, who missed five months of Cardiff City's relegation campaign because of last season's injury, joined Pumas in the summer and has played six games for the Mexico City-based side, scoring once.

He has suffered a long list of leg problems during a 19-year career which has also taken in Juventus and Nice, and his latest issue will be a concern for Bellamy who said last week 'there's still football in Ramsey'.

Wales' head coach will have been watching on with interest - and some trepidation - over the weekend as his players performed for their clubs prior to the international window.

Other than Ramsey there was better news for Bellamy as he prepares for the friendly against Thomas Tuchel's side at Wembley on Thursday, 9 October before hosting Belgium in a World Cup qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium the following Monday.

Wales players Joe Rodon (L) and Ethan Ampadu (far R) got valuable game time for Leeds United

Friday was a bumper football night for Welsh interest, with David Brooks captaining Bournemouth in a Premier League encounter that saw his fellow winger Harry Wilson lining up for opponents Fulham.

Brooks came off after 85 minutes - just after the Cherries had taken the lead over their visitors - while Wilson was replaced after 67 minutes.

In the Championship, striker Kieffer Moore started for Wrexham as they were held to a draw by Birmingham City. Nathan Broadhead got 20 minutes off the bench for the Dragons, while Lewis Koumas - who is on loan at Birmingham from Liverpool - also figured as a substitute.

Although Dan James has been ruled out of this international window through injury, three of his team-mates started in Leeds United's 2-1 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off. 

Goalkeeper Karl Darlow, defender Joe Rodon and midfielder Ethan Ampadu played the whole game, although Leeds skipper Ampadu did endure a nervous moment when VAR took a long look at his challenge on Pedro Porro that in the end only merited a yellow card. Spurs winger Brennan Johnson only got a run-out for the eight minutes of added time, while defender Ben Davies was an unused substitute.

Although Darlow should be match-sharp, fellow stoppers Adam Davies (Sheffield United) and Tom King (Everton) did not play for their clubs.

Swansea City's 3-1 home loss to Leicester City also contained plenty of Welsh interest. Centre-back Ben Cabango lasted the course for the Swans, with striker Liam Cullen getting 66 minutes. The Foxes started with Jordan James - who is on loan from Stade Rennais - and the midfielder came off with four minutes of normal time remaining with the win in the bag.

Cardiff City fielded three Wales squad members in their thrilling 4-3 win over Leyton Orient in League One. Centre-back Dylan Lawlor grabbed a goal, while right-back Ronan Kpakio and midfielder Joel Colwill provided assists.

Centre-back Chris Mepham played the entirety of West Bromwich Albion's 3-0 Championship defeat at Millwall, with Mepham also picking up a 12th-minute booking. In contrast, Jay Dasilva enjoyed his afternoon at left-back for Coventry City as they came away from Sheffield Wednesday with a handsome 5-0 win.

Sorba Thomas continues to impress for Stoke City, the left wing providing the assist for their goal in a 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers. Striker Mark Harries got five minutes off the bench for Oxford United in their 2-1 loss at Watford, although that was more than Josh Sheehan who remained on the bench in Bolton Wanderers' 2-1 win over Peterborough United.

On Sunday, Neco Williams retained his berth at left-back for a Nottingham Forest side that went to Newcastle United in the Premier League, but left still searching for form under new boss Ange Postecoglou after a 2-0 defeat.

Defenders: Ben Cabango (Swansea City), Jay Dasilva (Coventry City), Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Ronan Kpakio (Cardiff City), Dylan Lawlor (Cardiff City), Chris Mepham (West Bromwich Albion), Joe Rodon (Leeds United), Neco Williams (Nottingham Forest).

England's Charley Hull won her third LGPA Tour title by overhauling world number one Jeeno Thitikul on the final hole of the Queen City Championship.

Hull trailed by one shot leading into the par-five 18th hole, but Thailand's Thitikul four-putted to make bogey.

It left Hull a two-foot putt for birdie and victory, which she converted to seal her first LPGA Tour win since 2022.

"I wasn't really watching her putt for birdie because I thought she was going to hole it," said Hull.

"I guess it's not over until the fat lady sings but I was shaking over that last putt because I just didn't expect it. But yeah, it feels great."

England's Lottie Woad finished third, one shot behind Thitikul, in Ohio.

Both Hull and Thitikul reached the final green in two shots, with Thitikul putting her first putt inside six feet from the cup.

Hull missed her eagle chance, but Thitikul slid both her birdie attempt and her putt for par, which would have forced a play-off, past the hole.

Hull made no mistake from her own birdie chance to finish on 20 under overall and collect the $300,000 (Â£221,340) prize for victory.

Each carded a four-under 68 on the final round, giving Hull victory by the one-short margin she held after day three.

The 29-year-old, who had finished runner-up in her last two tournaments, held a two-stroke lead over Thitikul at the turn at TPC River's Bend on Sunday.

Thitikul closed to within one on the 10th and both birdied the 11th, but Hull's bogey at 13 allowed her rival to take the lead with a birdie at the next hole.

Hull responded with a birdie on the 16th but another bogey on 17 gave Thitikul the advantage she eventually squandered at the last.

Woad, 21, shot her best round of the week - a six-under 66 - on Sunday to finish on 18 under overall.

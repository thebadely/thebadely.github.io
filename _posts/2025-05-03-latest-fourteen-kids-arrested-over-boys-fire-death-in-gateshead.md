Experts revealed that Fourteen children have been arrested over the death of a 14-year-old boy in a fire at an industrial unit.

The blaze broke out at Fairfield industrial park in the Bill Quay area of Gateshead on Friday evening.

It was extinguished, but a body believed to be that of Layton Carr, who had been reported missing, was located inside the building, Northumbria Police said.

Eleven boys and three girls aged between 11 and 14 were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and remain in police custody.

Police said they received reports of the fire shortly after 20:00 BST at the 15-acre site on the southern banks River Tyne.

It has fallen into disrepair in recent years, with a gatehouse leading to the site smashed down and a number of buildings left abandoned.

Officers said the inquiry into the blaze was at an early stage and asked members of the public not to speculate about what happened.

Det Ch Insp Louise Jenkins said it was an "extremely tragic incident where a boy has sadly lost his life".

"Our thoughts are with Layton's family as they begin to attempt to process the loss of their loved one.

"Our specialist officers will continue to support them in whatever way they can."

A cordon would remain in place, along with a police presence, to carry out investigations and "offer reassurance to the public", she said.

Police have appealed for anyone with information to get in touch.

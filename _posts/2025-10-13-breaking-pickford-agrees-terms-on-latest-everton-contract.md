Here’s what you need to know: Jordan Pickford made his Premier League debut in 2016

England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has agreed terms over a new deal with Everton.

The 31-year-old joined the Toffees in 2017 for Â£30m, a British record fee for a goalkeeper at the time.

Sources have told BBC Sport an announcement will be made in the coming days.

Pickford, whose current deal expires in 2027, has won Everton's player of the year award four times, including the past three seasons.

He is currently on international duty with England but acknowledged to BBC Radio 5 Live that the terms of his contract have been settled.

"I think it's agreed. I have got my sole focus on tomorrow's game [versus Latvia] to be fair. I have got my England head on," Pickford said.

"We will see what happens after that but, yes, we are in a good place."

The extension is a major boost for the club, who tied captain James Tarkowski down to a new two-year deal earlier this month. 

Pickford breaks record - and why he is number one

Pickford has made 329 appearances for Everton since joining from boyhood club Sunderland.

He has played a major role in helping Everton retain their Premier League status despite managerial sackings, financial rule breaches and points deductions in recent seasons.

Everton are currently eighth in the Premier League table and unbeaten at their new home - the Hill Dickinson Stadium - so far this season.

Pickford said the club's players have responded to Toffees boss David Moyes' demand to start the campaign on the front foot.

"The manager was pretty straight with us at pre-season. He wants us pushing where Everton should be," added Pickford.

"I feel in the last few years we haven't really started so well. At the start of this season, we have had seven games and got 11 points. We are just above mid-table, so that is a better start and it's about keeping that momentum."

Pickford has won 79 caps for England and has been first choice for the Three Lions since the 2018 World Cup. 

He broke a long-standing record set by Gordon Banks last week by recording an eighth consecutive clean sheet in the Three Lions' 3-0 win against Wales.

The last goal he conceded for England was more than a year ago, in a 2-1 Nations League defeat by Greece. 

"It's a great honour to have them milestones and records," said Pickford.

"But if anyone asked me 'do you want a clean sheet or win the game?' I will always want to just win the game. 

"I am always a team-first person. It's a 4-3 win over a nil-nil draw all day long."

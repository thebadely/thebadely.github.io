It has been recently reported that Organisers of a new community pantry to help people who are struggling and needing food say there has been high demand for their help.

The pantry, based inside the Stan Ball Centre in Bloxwich in the West Midlands, opened in January and offers everyday essentials at reduced prices, with washing capsules the most popular item

Users of the community centre for older and vulnerable adults can access it and it is open to the public one day a week, for a membership of £2 a year.

Retired teacher Jane Collins said in the current cost of living crisis it was a "really good idea".

"[The crisis] is just a nightmare, you have to think twice before you buy things," she added.

"Even things like biscuits and cake are now luxury items, not staples. I would love to see places like this all over the country."

So far there are 178 members of the pantry.

Walsall Council put forward £200,000 to support the community pantry schemes and more are set to open.

Sam Hulme, who uses the centre for adults with learning disabilities, said it was very useful.

"I can nip in here and get what I need. Prices are so expensive nowadays and I've found it really handy to grab what I need here."

Liza Jackson, project manager, said customers were surprised at the look and feel of the pantry.

"The customers are shocked at the prices. They really enjoy the quality and choice," she said.

"We thought people should have the choice and we didn't want the look at feel of a food bank.

"We felt some people wouldn't access food banks, if nothing else because of pride. We wanted it to be a destination to come here and shop."

Eleanor Boycott, chief executive of the Bloxwich Community Partnership, a charity which runs the centre, added: "The response has been great, there's been a lot of interest.

"I think the community store is a step before the food bank so people can extend their money a little bit further and choose the food that they want."

Another community shop has also opened at Bentley community centre and another is due to open in Blakenall.

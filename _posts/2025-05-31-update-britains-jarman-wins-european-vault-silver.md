GB's Jarman wins silver after sticking near-perfect first vault

Briton Jake Jarman won a silver medal in the men's vault on the final day of the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Leipzig, Germany.

The 23-year-old, who won European vault gold in 2022 and 2024, had an almost-perfect first vault, but his second was less precise and gave him an average score of 14.733.

Armenia's Artur Davtyan took gold, pipping Jarman by less than a point with a 14.799 score, while Ukraine's Nazar Chepurnyi claimed the bronze with 14.583.

"Mixed emotions, I am more frustrated at myself to be honest," Jarman told the BBC.

"I did the best first vault, I went into my second vault shaking because I was so nervous. Overall I am really happy."

Jarman's first vault scored a 15.2, the first time at these championships any male athlete had gone over 15 on the apparatus.

But the execution of the second vault let him down and resulted in a 14.266 score which reduced his average.

Britain's Harry Hepworth, who won bronze in the men's vault at the 2024 Paris Olympics, just missed out on a medal in fourth place with a score of 14.350.

Defending champions Lightning reach Grand Final

Loughborough Lightning have the chance to go for an unprecedented three-peat after booking their spot to face London Pulse in the Netball Super League Grand Final.

Defending champions Lightning were condemned to the preliminary final after they were beaten last week by Pulse, the regular season leaders.

That meant a repeat of last year's Grand Final against Manchester Thunder and hosts Lightning came from behind to win 69-57 on Sunday.

Thunder scored 10 unanswered goals en route to a 19-12 lead after the first quarter, but Lightning did not look back after a blistering second.

After going 27-20 down, Jodie Gibson came on at goal defence to give Lightning a boost, while Samantha Wallace-Joseph did the damage at the other end. 

The Trinidad and Tobago shooter converted five two-point super shots during the second quarter to help Lightning into a 37-30 lead at half-time.

Thunder called a tactical timeout at 44-33 down, while South Africa shooter Elmere van der Berg was brought off for the first time all season.

But Lightning still led 52-40 heading into the final quarter and stayed clear to book a rematch with Pulse in next Sunday's Grand Final at London's O2 Arena.

Player of the match, Lightning's Alice Harvey: "It means so much. Last week's loss hurt but that was a performance we were proud of. It wasn't always easy but we showed grit.

"Never underestimate a Lightning bounce-back. We definitely want to do the three-peat and I think that performance showed that."

Lightning head coach Vic Burgess: "We needed a really strong second quarter to come back and it was 25-11 [in that quarter], and that's just huge. We were really high on energy and knew we just had to keep that consistency.

"The intensity of getting through this game, it'll give us a huge lift [for the Grand Final]." 

Thunder head coach Karen Greig: "I don't think we were good enough for long enough. We had a really strong first quarter and to let a team back in at that point, it gives them the confidence to push on and thrive.

"It's been a tough year so to come away with third place, I'm disappointed yeah, but super proud."

Lightning have won three NSL titles and have reached their eighth Grand Final from 20 NSL seasons

They will attempt to become the first team to win three consecutive NSL titles, with Nat Panagarry, Beth Cobden, Ella Clark and Hannah Joseph mainstays of the squad throughout that run

Thunder's Elmere van den Berg was comfortably the highest scorer in the regular season, with 496 goals from 14 games

Lightning's top scorer Samantha Wallace-Joseph was eighth with 272 from 11

Lightning and Pulse were vying for top spot for much of the regular season, and their direct tussles were fascinating.

In round two, Pulse scored a statement 77-51 victory in Loughborough over the reigning champions, but that result was avenged at the Copper Box in May, when Lightning were 58-53 winners.

Table-topping Pulse took the honours 50-49 in last week's play-off semi-final nailbiter, and now the teams go at it again.

The Grand Final line-up is the same as in 2023, when Lightning came from behind to win, and big-stage experience weighs heavily in Loughborough's favour.

Pulse topped the regular-season table in 2023, too, but could not finish the job in the play-offs and are still seeking a first NSL title.

It has been recently reported that Tiana Power (right) scored four tries for Wigan while sister Shaniah also crossed against Warrington

Wigan returned to the top of Women's Super League with an 80-0 demolition of bottom side Warrington.

The Warriors ran in 14 tries with Tiana Power claiming four of them.

Elsewhere, third-placed York Valkyrie thrashed Barrow Raiders 58-0 for a fifth straight win to stay within two points of St Helens who dropped from the summit to second.

And Leeds are three points further back in fourth after a 54-12 win over fifth-placed Huddersfield.

Sisters Tiana and Shaniah Power both crossed inside five minutes for unbeaten Wigan before a Cerys Jones double and scores from Georgia Wilson, Mia Atherton and Tiana's second put the leaders out of sight by half-time.

Tiana Power and Jones completed hat-tricks after Megan Williams crossed to take the Warriors past 50 points before Australian centre Power added her fourth. Tries from Eva Hunter, Remi Wilton, and Kaitlin Hilton capped the rout.

Isabel Rowe added 12 goals from 14 attempts as Wigan made it 156 points without reply from their past two matches.

York, WSL champions in the last two seasons, were made to work hard by second-bottom Barrow in the first half, building a 16-0 half-time lead thanks to Savannah Andrade, Lisa Parker and Emma Kershaw scores.

But the floodgates opened after the break as Peace Lekuru scored her first WSL tries with a hat-trick. Zoe Hornby, Emma Kershaw, Tara Moxon, Evie Sexton, Eboni Partington and Andrade also crossed as the Raiders shipped nine second-half tries.

Tilly Davies gave Huddersfield an early lead away to Leeds, but the hosts blasted back with five unanswered tries before half-time from Izzy Northrop (2), Ella Donnelly, Melanie Howard and Ebony Stead.

The second half followed the same pattern with the Rhinos again outscoring their West Yorkshire rivals by five tries to one.

Stead completed her hat-trick, while Shannon Brown, Evie Cousins and Ruby Bruce also crossed, with Freya Whitehead grabbing a consolation score for the Giants.

Here’s what you need to know: Kerr came on as a substitute in the 75th minute before scoring Chelsea's third goal on Sunday

For a world-class striker, 20 months is a long time to go without a goal.

But Sam Kerr didn't have a say in the matter - because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

The 32-year-old had not played since December 2023 after injuring her knee in a training camp with the Blues.

After 637 days out, she marked her return in style on Sunday - scoring her 100th goal for the club just 13 minutes after her introduction in a 3-1 Women's Super League win over Aston Villa.

"It's almost as if we have got an extra signing with her back," Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton told Sky Sports.

"It's a big help for us going forward."

Kerr makes triumphant return in Chelsea win over Villa

Kerr, in true centre-forward fashion, pounced on a loose ball after a goalmouth scramble and made no mistake with the finish, slamming it past Villa keeper Ellie Roebuck before celebrating joyfully with her team-mates.

Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor said the goal rounded off a "perfect day" for Kerr.

"Personally, I'm really pleased," Bompastor said. "But I think she is also really pleased with that, and you know what Sam represents for Chelsea. For me, she's an idol.

"We all know how tough it was for her, being away from the game and from the pitch for so long.

"She doesn't like being in front of everyone and getting the limelight, but she really deserves it. I think she needs to enjoy it as well because she's been through tough moments, so when you have positives, you need to celebrate them."

Kerr did not play at all during Bompastor's first season as Chelsea boss, in which the Blues won the domestic Treble and became the first team to go through a 22-game WSL campaign unbeaten.

She was, however, a key figure in three successive WSL title-winning seasons under former manager Emma Hayes from 2020-21 to 2022-23.

"She's an absolute demon in the box," Hampton added.

"It's about time she starts annoying opposition goalkeepers - she does it enough to me in training."

Since Kerr's injury, Chelsea have had swapped managers and brought in a host of attacking talent.

A couple of weeks after Kerr tore her ACL, the club broke the British transfer record when they signed Colombia forward Mayra Ramirez as a replacement.

And just earlier this month, United States star Alyssa Thompson joined for just under Â£1m.

But even on a day when Thompson - now Chelsea's record signing - made her debut, it was Kerr who made the headlines.

"It feels good," Kerr said about her return. "I am really happy but [feel] a lot of relief. It's been a long journey and I'm glad it's over."

She added that "it means everything" to score her 100th goal for the club.

"When I signed for Chelsea I never thought I would score 100 goals," she added.

"To do it for such a massive club, and a club I love so dearly, is a massive achievement and something I am really proud of. I don't reflect too much on my goals, but to score 100 for Chelsea is something I will keep with me forever."

Kerr has now scored 59 goals in 76 WSL matches for Chelsea, and has the second-best goals-per-game ratio (0.78) out of players to have scored more than five WSL goals - behind only Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.

"It will be a huge weight taken off her shoulders," said former England defender Gilly Flaherty on Sky Sports.

"When a player does come back from injury and they go games without scoring and it goes on and on, there's that pressure."

Kerr's period on the sidelines was disrupted by a high-profile court case in which she was on trial for racially aggravated harassment, being was found not guilty in February.

In May, Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis, who plays for West Ham, announced the birth of their first child - a baby boy called Jagger.

After Sunday's comeback, Brighton midfielder Fran Kirby, who played alongside Kerr at Chelsea, told Sky Sports: "I'm absolutely delighted for her. It's been a real tough journey for her.

"She belongs out on the football pitch and I'm delighted she her 100th goal for Chelsea. 

"She has been waiting a long time for that moment. Hopefully she can stay fit, stay healthy, and contribute more throughout the season."

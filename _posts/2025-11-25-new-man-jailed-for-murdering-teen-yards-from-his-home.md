According to new developments, A man who murdered a teenager yards from his home, in an attack thought to have been motivated by gang rivalry, has been jailed for life.

Bristol Crown Court heard Eddie Kinuthia, 19, was ambushed and stabbed multiple times in St Pauls, Bristol, in July 2023. 

Zachariah Talbert-Young, who was found guilty of his murder, had arrived to the Grosvenor Road area on an electric bike, dressed in black, and attacked Mr Kinuthia, who died in hospital from a leg injury.

The 27-year-old, from Easton, was also found guilty of attempting to murder another teenager, Nathan Williams, while on bail and was jailed for at least 34 years for both offences.

Paul Hayden, 22, from Hanham, was also jailed for a minimum of 18 years for the attempted murder of Mr Williams. He was previously cleared of murdering Mr Kinuthia.

During the trial the jury were told 150 people had been attending a community event in St Pauls on 21 July. 

Two masked men dressed in black, one of which was Talbert-Young, arrived in the area on an electric bike and Mr Kinuthia was stabbed as many as six times, the court heard.

The fatal injury was a five-inch stab wound to his thigh, which severed his femoral artery and caused "catastrophic blood loss", the judge said.

Mr Kinuthia's mother, Irene Muthemba, delivered an emotional witness statement in court, where she urged those involved in knife crime to "choose love over hate".

"Eddie deserved to grow and learn from his mistakes and discover the world. You denied him the chance," she said. 

"We have seen enough bloodshed on our streets.

"I kindly request you tell your friends, who seem to think that what you did is cool, tell them it is sad and weak. Tell them it is shameful and disgusting behaviour.

"Tell them carrying knives is not cool because you're sitting there behind the glass."

Addressing the defendants directly in the dock, Ms Muthemba called for more black youths to be on the other side of the glass as barristers.

"Just imagine if your parents had gone out to buy you those suits for your graduation instead of for a murder trial," she said. 

"You can be sure you won't be needing them for a very, very long time. 

"I'm hoping one day you will tell me personally why you took my child's life – the truth in your own words. I look forward to that day."

Judge Mr Justice Pepperall said Mr Kinuthia's death was related to a postcode war between gangs in Bristol - the 1-6s and the 2-4s - and said the "feud has come at an all consuming cost with a senseless round of tit-for-tat killings".

Talbert-Young was closely associated with east Bristol's 1-6 group while Mr Kinuthia was regularly seen associating with members of the 2-4s, which is linked to St Pauls.

Talbert-Young must serve a minimum of 34 years for the murder of Mr Kinuthia and 20 years for the attempted murder of Mr Williams, to run concurrently. 

Speaking outside court, Det Ch Insp Mark Almond, of Avon and Somerset Police, paid tribute to the "patience and dignity" shown by both families throughout the "lengthy and harrowing" process. 

He added: "These convictions mean that two dangerous men will now remain behind bars and our streets will be safer as a result.

"Knife crime destroys lives. It devastates families, fuels fear and tears the fabric of communities."

Ms Muthemba added she was happy justice had finally been served, after waiting patiently for 858 days "since this nightmare began".

"We as adults have a responsibility to do everything we can in our power to show these young people who are carrying knives that it costs so much," she said.

"Nothing is worth taking a life."

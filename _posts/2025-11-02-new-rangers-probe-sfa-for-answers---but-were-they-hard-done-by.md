Reaction to red card was 'outstanding' - Rohl

Rangers have requested an explanation from the Scottish FA over why Celtic centre-half Auston Trusty was not sent off during the Ibrox side's 3-1 League Cup semi-final defeat at Hampden.

Head coach Danny Rohl had earlier refused to use the controversy as an excuse for his side's derby loss, preferring to focus on their "outstanding" reaction to going down to 10 men.

Thelo Aasgaard was sent off shortly before half-time with Celtic already 1-0 ahead, but Rangers fought back to take the game into extra time before succumbing 3-1 to their city rivals.

The consensus among pundits was that the Norway midfielder deserved to be dismissed, but there was surprise by some that Trusty and Anthony Ralston did not follow for later incidents.

Trusty caught Rangers goalkeeper Jack Butland on the head with an errant boot, and right-back Ralston handled the ball - conceding a penalty - while already on a yellow card.

"It is not my position to talk about decisions," Rohl told BBC Sport Scotland. 

"You can have a discussion, but I will not be part of this discussion. I concentrate on my group and I see a lot of positive things."

There was, though, an air of what might have been in the Rangers dressing room at Hampden after they worked their way back into the semi-final.

"I think this is tough because we had the feeling we could beat them, even with 10 men," Rohl said. 

"We put a lot of effort in, showed a lot of resilience and a lot of good spirit in the second half, nice football, we were brave.

"We went to a more offensive shape and we had our moments. We were not just sitting back and I thought the equaliser was deserved.

"Then you go into extra time and then go down 2-1, but even then we had two opportunities when we were one against one."

Rohl has been in charge of four games since succeeding Russell Martin, with two league wins book-ended by losses to Brann in the Europa League and now Celtic.

However, the German sees positive signs.

"Our reaction after the red card was outstanding," he said. "But it is a long time, 55 minutes and then extra time, with 10 men and my team put a lot into it.

"We have to take the positives and look for improvements. I am convinced, if we continue in this direction, we will have a lot of wins this season."

Should Auston Trusty (right) have been sent off?

Former Scotland strikers Billy Dodds and James McFadden both thought Celtic centre-back Trusty was fortunate to only be yellow carded when his boot connected with the face of Butland just before the break.

"He just rakes his studs across Butland's face," Dodds said on Sportsound. 

"That would have really levelled up the game if he had been sent off and you wonder what might have happened."

Dodds also thought right-back Ralston should have been shown a second yellow card for the handball that led to the penalty from which James Tavernier equalised nine minutes before the end of normal time.

"It was intentional that he threw himself to block the ball," the former Rangers forward said. "I don't think [referee] Nick Walsh covered himself in glory."

McFadden reckons that, although Rohl refused to comment, he "will be fuming with the decisions that have gone against them".

"It is a contributing factor to the end result, but he's shown as a manager he knows what he's doing," he added on Sportsound.

"He had to face adversity and he was positive, putting attackers in midfield, and for them to show the way they did, he clearly has a lot to work with."

McFadden has seen progress already under the former Sheffield Wednesday manager and Dodds, who was on the Ibrox coaching staff last term, believes there are signs Rohl "has the players onside".

However, problems remain as they host Roma before returning to domestic action 14 points behind Premiership leaders Hearts and five adrift of Celtic.

On-loan Wolverhampton Wanderers centre-back Nasser Djiga was constantly exposed at Hampden and Â£8m striker Youssef Chermiti again failed to impress.

"They didn't start well," Dodds said. "Their wing-backs were pinned back, but does he go back to a four now because they were better in their second-half shape?

"Does he keep with a five to be more secure or does he go back to a four because it shows that, when you are focused and have to defend one-on-one situations, Rangers can do it against Celtic because you have to be so focused.

"You have to make sure you are switched on when you are attacking and that's been the problem. When they turn them over, they have been easy to play through."

Experts revealed that Leanne Crichton has been confirmed as the Rangers Women head coach on a three-year deal.

The 37-year-old former Glasgow City, Celtic and Hibernian midfielder is a regular pundit on BBC Scotland's radio and television coverage, after a successful playing career which featured 72 caps for her country.

Having spent spells coaching with Motherwell and Glasgow City, she now takes a giant leap into the world of management as Jo Potter's successor.

Former England international Potter, who opted to move on to Crystal Palace, won both cups in both of her seasons in charge, while Rangers were runners-up in the SWPL twice.

Crichton, who had three spells as a player at City, said leaving the club was "one of the toughest decisions I've had to make".

She is now focused on following in Potter's footsteps and delivering silverware at Rangers.

"It's a total privilege for me to be here," she said. "I don't think second best is acceptable here and for us, that will be the aim - that we deliver a successful team."

So, why have Rangers trusted Crichton to continue Potter's success and what will she bring to the role?

"There's no doubt she's ready," Crichton's long-time friend and former Scotland team-mate Rachel Corsie told BBC Scotland. 

"I think at some point you have to take the step to have your first role.

"She just has this relentlessness. It's a huge opportunity and a huge role and one that reflects who Leanne is and the work she's put in.

"She's genuinely really excited. I think she knows there's high expectation and that for her is just something that she thrives upon."

Crichton is no stranger to big stages and high pressure, having seen the women's game expand exponentially during her playing career.

She played a key role in Scotland's first win at a women's major tournament, starting the attack from the heart of midfield that led to Caroline Weir's decisive goal against Spain in 2017. 

Crichton featured in the first Women's FA Cup final to take place at Wembley with Notts County and won a spate of major honours with Glasgow City.

"Everyone knew her as a competitive person, the person that never gave in," Corsie said.

"There was always another game, it was always about winning the next game, always about winning the next trophy, like going on the hunt, fine-tuning herself, getting better, and on to the next thing. That was her as a player."

In addition to the "authoritative" side displayed as a player, Corsie believes coaching has nurtured a more tender side to Crichton's personality.

Having taken a player-coach role at Motherwell in 2021, Crichton returned to Glasgow City in November 2024 to assist Leanne Ross.

"She's added a whole other dimension - she's a natural leader, but you take on a different level of care as a coach and she's thrived in that part," Corsie said.

"Sometimes that's where coaches struggle the most. Whenever these hard conversations have to happen, if you don't have that relationship with the players it can become fractured quite quickly.

"It's made people really connect with Leanne. It's helped Leanne work with players and help them develop and make them want to develop."

When asked what she expects Crichton's team to look like at Rangers stylistically, Corsie said she expects a blend of style and substance.

"There's a natural want to play football because as a player Leanne was like that. 

"She was someone who would willingly put a challenge in but she could read the game, she enjoyed the ball being on the ground. So naturally, I think as a coach, she appreciates that."

While admitting she isn't privy to Crichton's preferred formation, Corsie knows their will be certain standards that players simply have to meet.

"She's very well connected to that Scottish football feel though," Corsie said of her former team-mate.

"And there's definitely going to be a passion from her that you've got to compete. 

"The perspective that you don't want to be outrun, don't want to be outworked. Those are things that Leanne in her life just would not accept.

"There will be a big expectation on playing attacking football and being really competitive and aggressive."

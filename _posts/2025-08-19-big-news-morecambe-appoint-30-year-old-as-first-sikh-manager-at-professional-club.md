According to new developments, Ashvir Singh Johal spent time working alongside Como boss Cesc Fabregas during the Spaniard's time in charge of the club's youth team

Ashvir Singh Johal has become the first Sikh to take charge of a professional British club with his appointment as Morecambe manager.

The 30-year-old also becomes the youngest manager in the top five tiers of English football.

The Shrimps were taken over by the Panjab Warriors consortium on Sunday, ending a lengthy period of uncertainty for the National League club.

Johal, who has never managed a first-team side, replaces Derek Adams, who was sacked on Monday.

Johal has previously worked under Kolo Toure at Wigan and as an assistant to Cesc Fabregas during his time with the youth team at Italian side Como.

Earlier this summer, Johal also became one of the youngest coaches in the history of English football to complete his Uefa Pro Licence qualification.

Prior to his move into senior football with Wigan in 2022, he spent 10 years in various roles in Leicester City's academy.

In an interview with the BBC in June, Johal said: "I have been fortunate to work with and learn from some incredible people, and I'm especially grateful to Kolo and Cesc.

"I know what world-class standards look like, how to lead with clarity, and how to develop a team with a real identity.

"We will create an environment that brings the best out of people, that people want to be part of, and that drives people to improve every day."

Morecambe had their opening fixtures postponed after the National League suspended them over a failure to comply with the league's rules.

They are scheduled to play Altrincham on Saturday in what would be their first competitive match since being relegated from League Two in May.

However, the BBC understands the club currently have just five contracted players and that, as of Tuesday morning, they are not insured to train so a postponement of that game is possible.

Experts revealed that Gabriel Magalhaes is working to be fit for the new season 

Gabriel Magalhaes believes this season "will be different" for Arsenal after admitting they have "let a couple of titles slip through our fingers" in recent years.

Mikel Arteta has transformed the Gunners since taking over almost six years ago, but they have not won major silverware since FA Cup success in 2020 - his first season in charge.

The Gunners have finished second in the Premier League for three successive years and lost in the semi-finals of both the Champions League and Carabao Cup last season - to eventual winners Paris St-Germain and Newcastle respectively.

As Arsenal begin their pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong, BBC Sport looks at the changes that needed to be made in an attempt to lift a trophy for the first time in five years.

Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli all spent lengthy spells on the sidelines last season, which disrupted Arsenal's attack. 

Striker Gabriel Jesus also missed a large part of the campaign with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and - with other recognised attackers out - midfielder Mikel Merino ended up playing as a makeshift centre-forward. 

Merino did well - scoring seven times in 28 Premier League games and hitting an important goal in the victory over Real Madrid in the Champions League - but Arteta will want to avoid such a scenario this season. 

It wasn't all bad for the Gunners, of course, as those injuries allowed academy products Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri to break into the first team. 

Lewis-Skelly has since gone on to make his debut for England and sign a new long-term deal. 

Nwaneri is close to doing the same - after scoring nine goals in 37 appearances. 

"I don't think we can give excuses,"  Gabriel, 27, told BBC Sport. "We did everything we could in the last three years. I feel like we had a little bit of bad luck sometimes, but we all believe that we can win big titles.

"We're focused on what our manager is telling us to do, and what we have to do, and what we have to improve. I think this year will be different."

Gabriel and Arsenal faced Gyokeres in last season's Champions League

Arsenal have been busy in the transfer market and will have several new faces in their squad when they start their Premier League season at Manchester United on Sunday, 17 August.

The Gunners have already signed winger Noni Madueke, midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. They are also working to complete transfers for striker Viktor Gyokeres and young defender Cristhian Mosquera.

Zubimendi is one of the most highly rated defensive midfielders in Europe. 

Premier League champions Liverpool tried to sign him last season, and he played a crucial role in the Euro 2024 final as a half-time substitute as Spain beat England. 

Alongside him, Arsenal have brought in midfielder Norgaard from Brentford to provide experience now Jorginho and Thomas Partey have departed.

Madueke is seen as ideal back-up for Saka, but also someone who can play on both wings, challenge Martinelli for his position, and continue developing his own game.

"I think the players that came will help us out a lot," Gabriel said. 

"The club is doing what is best for the players and the manager. They are definitely doing their best to bring the best players that can help us, but we have to focus on what we can do out on the pitch. 

"The players that are here are doing that. We are strong and we are getting stronger with these new players.

"Definitely, it excites me. We want to have the best players. To be in the dispute for titles, you have to have the best players."

Arsenal will hope the expected arrival of Gyokeres from Sporting will bring goals, with the Swede having scored 54 in 52 games last season.

Gabriel has played against Gyokeres, and mimicked the forward's celebration after scoring in Arsenal's 5-0 win over Sporting in November in the Champions League.

"We all know he is a great player, but he is a Sporting player not an Arsenal player," Gabriel said.

"Playing against him last year was a challenge. He is great and had a great season. About the celebration, it is something I can't talk about right now."

Gabriel missed the final weeks of last season after injuring a hamstring in April. He had surgery to fix the problem and is working to be fit for the beginning of the season.

The Brazilian has signed a contract that will keep him at the club until 2029 - and says he "didn't hear" about links with a move to Saudi Arabia.

The feeling around Arsenal is they are ready to take the next step, and feel confident to say publicly they are ready to lift a trophy.

"I've been at the club for five years now and I've seen how much the club has grown." added Gabriel, who was speaking before the club's pre-season tour, where the Gunners will play AC Milan on 23 July and Newcastle on 27 July in the Singapore Festival of Football.

"I am here to win big titles and I do believe that this season will be different. We have let a couple of titles slip through our fingers recently.

"We almost won but I think this year, things will be different. I have a lot of faith in that."

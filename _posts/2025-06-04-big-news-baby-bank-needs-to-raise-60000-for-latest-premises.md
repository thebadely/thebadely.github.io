Let's dive into the details: A charity that supplies families with clothes and essential supplies for babies and children has said it needs to raise £60,000 to help kit out its new premises. 

Leeds Baby Bank is currently based at St John's Offices in the city centre, but has found a new home in Armley which is much larger and more accessible. 

The charity is crowd funding for the money to pay for things like flooring, signage, and shelving to store their supplies. 

Founder Chantal Nogbu said demand for their services was currently so high - with more than 200 families in need of help - they had temporarily closed their waiting list. 

"It's a stark reality that 40,000 children in our city are living in absolute poverty," she said.

"We exist to ensure no child in Leeds goes without because of poverty, but lately we have been overwhelmed by the number of people needing our support. 

"Currently we have over 200 families needing help and have made the heart-breaking decision to close our waiting list."

The charity hopes to re-open to more families needing support from mid-July.

By moving to a larger building they hope to be able to help more families as well as become a supportive hub and meeting place. 

Ms Nogbu added: "The new building will make it possible for us to host groups too, from toddler sessions to baby first aid classes, combating isolation and fostering essential parenting skills. "

Amy Asher, Community Development Manager, said the new premises would be a "game changer". 

"We need to be able to move in and actually function and get it moving," she said.

"We need the signs up. We need racking. We need shelving. We need flooring so we can actually be based there and it can function."

She said one of the problems with their current site is the access, as families have to enter a loading bay at the bottom of the building and wait for staff to bring the supplies they need to them - and often have to take the items home on the bus or train. 

The new site would have a drive-up loading bay, making it easier for larger items such as prams and cots to be lifted into a car or taxi. 

Ms Asher said: "It's going to be a game changer. It really is. So we're very, very excited to be there."

Experts revealed that Abbey Road studios has announced the nominees for its Music Photography Awards, after considering more than 20,000 submissions from 30 different countries. 

The photographs up for awards feature stars including Chappell Roan, Lana Del Rey, Charli XCX, Tyler the Creator, Pulp, The 1975, Maggie Rogers, Fontaines DC, Doja Cat, Central Cee and Burna Boy.

Fans can vote for music moment of the year on the MPA's website until 23 September and the awards ceremony will take place at London's Abbey Road on 2 October. 

Mark Robertson, Abbey Road's director of marketing and creative, thanked the "incredibly gifted community of photographers who continue to impress with their work".

He added the images "prove that music photography is a genuine art to be celebrated and plays a vital role in shaping culture".

The awards include two new categories this year - portrait and festivals - with an additional guest category called club culture.

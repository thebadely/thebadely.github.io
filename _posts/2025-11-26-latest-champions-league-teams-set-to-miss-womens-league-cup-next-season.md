Let's dive into the details: Chelsea are the reigning Women's League Cup champions after beating Manchester City in the final in March

Teams who qualify for the league phase of the Women's Champions League will no longer participate in the League Cup, under new plans aimed at revamping the competition.

The format change is deemed necessary to help ease scheduling issues and to protect player welfare.

BBC Sport understands clubs voted in favour of the proposal to be introduced for the 2026-27 season, which still needs to be approved by the Football Association.

Teams from the top two divisions of women's football currently contest the competition.

Next year that number is set to increase following the expansion of the WSL to 14 teams.

Removing the teams who feature in the Champions League will help reduce the number of minutes of their players.

The Champions League expanded to 18 teams this season with more matches.

Manchester United, Chelsea and holders Arsenal are in the top European competition this season.

Under the proposals for the League Cup, a Swiss style league format will replace the current group stage, meaning all teams are ranked in a single league table with fixtures being dictated by region.

The knockout phase of the competition will remain the same, with the top eight teams in the league table qualifying for the quarterfinals.

League Cup matches will be played on the same nights that Champions League matches are due to be scheduled.

The proposals follow a WSL Football-led comprehensive consultation process with a competition working group, which included clubs and the Football Supporters' Association.

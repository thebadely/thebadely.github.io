Experts revealed that Tommy Paul won the men's singles title at Queen's in 2024

BBC Sport has agreed a three-year rights extension with the Lawn Tennis Association to continue broadcasting the Queen's Club Championships.

The deal will bring the event to audiences across TV, radio and digital services until 2027.

The 2025 edition of Queen's will feature women for the first time in over 50 years, with a WTA 500 event taking place in the week before the men take to the courts.

The London tournament is a traditional fixture in the grass-court season before Wimbledon.

British number one Katie Boulter and former US Open winner Emma Raducanu are set to compete in the women's event, while 2024 Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz will take part in the men's event.

"The grass-court season is synonymous with British summer," said Alex Kay-Jelski, Director of BBC Sport.

"For BBC Sport it marks the start of a huge summer of women's sporting events, kicking off with the women's tournament at Queen's."

The deal also includes rights to show LTA events at Eastbourne and Nottingham, in the fortnight before the Wimbledon Championships begin.

"This year promises to be the LTA's best grass-court season yet, with women and men competing in all our events for the very first time," said Chris Pollard, the LTA managing director of commercial and operations.

The Queen's Club women's main-draw event begins on 9 June, with the men's tournament starting on 16 June. Wimbledon begins on 30 June.

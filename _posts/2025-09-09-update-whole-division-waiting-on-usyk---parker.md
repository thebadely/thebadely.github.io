Experts revealed that Joseph Parker (left) has fought 252 rounds compared with Wardley's 72

Fabio Wardley said he had no hesitation about taking a fight with Joseph Parker and plans to prove he is a world class heavyweight by knocking out his rival.

The Briton faces Parker on 25 October at London's O2 Arena, with the winner expected to be Oleksandr Usyk's next opponent.

Like Parker with the WBO, Wardley is ranked highly by the WBA but decided to take on the New Zealander rather than wait for an injured Usyk to return to action.

"It wasn't really much of a consideration," 30-year-old Wardley told BBC Sport.

"I believe I should be in the conversation for those top heavyweights. It's something maybe the public think needs to be proven.

"But what better way to do that than take on the number two heavyweight in the world in Joseph Parker."

The heavyweights met at their first news conference on Thursday in London, but there were few fireworks aside from the customary promises of domination and knockouts.

Former world champion Parker, 33, has always been a fan favourite but has reinvented himself in recent years with big wins over Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole.

His run was meant to rewarded with a world title shot, but a meeting with then IBF champion Daniel Dubois in February was cancelled in fight week.

Parker, the WBO's interim champion, then had his shot at Usyk postponed because of an injury to the Ukrainian.

The WBO has granted Usyk a 90-day medical extension to agree terms with Parker, meaning a resolution to whether the undisputed champion fights or vacates his WBO belt may be delayed until December.

There is a chance Usyk decides to vacate before then, but it is the second time a row Parker has had a world title shot delayed.

"As a fighter all you want to do is fight," Parker said of the disappointment.

"Every fight's a risky fight, but at this stage it is a big risk. I have a lot to lose.

"I don't want to be waiting around for Usyk. I want to be busy and I want to fight often.

"The whole division is just waiting on Usyk and seeing when he's fit to fight again."

Should the bout get upgraded to a world title fight is of no concern to Wardley, however.

The knockout artist will take Parker's position as next in line with a victory and cap off what will be a stunning rise to world class level having started off in white collar boxing.

"This is already a world title fight. With it on the line or without it there, this is the biggest test of my career to date. This is my world title fight. We know what comes after," Wardley said.

"I don't see this going the distance. One way or another there is going to be a knockout.

"So far so good for me, it's always been me. I've always found a way to win. We know how much of a right hand in me that I can pull out at any moment.

"It would be the first or 12th round, but one way or another it's going to land."

'It has never been that female players are not worthy to play at night'

French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo has rejected accusations that not scheduling women's matches in the tournament's night session implies female players are not "worthy" of the slot.

The first six night sessions at Roland Garros have all been men's singles matches.

In a news conference earlier this week, two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur said the decision - which is debated every year - affects the growth of women's sport.

Mauresmo, a former WTA world number one, says no women's players have complained directly to her about the situation.

Asked if she understood that not picking women's matches led to some women feeling "not worthy", Mauresmo replied: "That's not what we're saying. I have to stop you right there.

"For me, the message that I always said, and I will repeat, is the conditions have not changed of having one unique match in the evening.

"The message has never been the girls are not worthy of playing at night. It's never been this."

Saturday's night session will clash with French side Paris St-Germain facing Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Munich.

The schedule was not decided before Mauresmo's news conference on Friday - but it was later confirmed 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic's match against Austria's Filip Misolic will occupy the slot.

"The Champions League final won't change much for us anyway," she said.

"We are trying to do the utmost for the tournament. We are very happy for PSG but we are organising our own event.

"There will be 15,000 people here so we want to give them the best possible match."

Jabeur made an impassioned post on social media later on Friday, writing "honouring one side of the sport shouldn't mean ignoring the other".

"The women's game has been writing its own legacy loudly, brilliantly, and for far too long without too much recognition," she added.

The French Open night sessions - which were introduced in 2021 - feature just one singles match on Court Philippe Chatrier.

A women's singles match, played over three sets, has not been put in this primetime slot since 2023 - meaning the past 20 night-time sessions have been men's singles matches, which are played over five sets.

Only four matches have been from the women's draw since they were brought in four years ago.

Questions are raised every year about whether the French Open should do more to promote the women's game.

Mauresmo says women's matches potentially going "really fast" is the justification behind the choices.

"There is nothing new under the sun compared to the previous editions," she said.

"We have one single match per night session. It hasn't changed. We won't change everything again.

"Two sets can go really fast when you have three sets minimum.

"It's not the level the [women] reach right now. I'm not talking about this."

Mauresmo also said the tournament does not want to have two matches in the night session, like the Australian Open and US Open, in fear of creating late finishes.

She pointed to the full crowd at Thursday night's match between French favourite Gael Monfils and British number one Jack Draper - played in front of a full house until it finished at 23:45 local time - as a measure of the schedule's success.

"If we have two matches in the night sessions, it doesn't work in terms of how late the players are going to finish," she said.

"But if we start earlier, the stands are going to be empty in most of the first match, so we keep this one match in the evening.

"It's not ideal. We cannot check every box because we have many, many things to think when we are doing these choices."

Mauresmo became frustrated with the questions about the lack of women's night matches during Friday's news conference.

After answering several questions about the subject, she quickly shut down another one towards the end of the half-hour event, saying she wanted to "change the subject".

Earlier, Mauresmo attempted to move on from the issue by implying there would be some women's matches picked over the coming days.

"Maybe we talk about this on the last Sunday," she said.

Mauresmo will be hoping the women's draw throws up some potential options for night matches.

"We have some rivalries which are interesting â Iga [Swiatek], Coco [Gauff], Aryna [Sabalenka], Madison [Keys]," she added.

"I think we are going through a very good era with interesting personalities and the level of play is very high.

"The level is much higher than before. We have more of an equal footing than before."

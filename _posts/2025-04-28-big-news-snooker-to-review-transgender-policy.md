According to new developments, World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association is the governing body of professional snooker and English billiards

Snooker's governing body will review its transgender inclusion policy following the landmark UK Supreme Court ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex under equalities law.

The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) said in a statement that its position "has always been that its policy would be subject to immediate review should there be a change in circumstances".

Trans women can currently compete in women's snooker events provided their testosterone levels have remained below a certain level for a period of 12 months before competing.

Judges at the country's highest court last week determined that the "concept of sex is binary" and a person with a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) in the female gender "does not come within the definition of a woman".

The WPBSA said: "This is a complicated issue as the WPBSA is a world body and has to ensure it complies with equality legislation around the world as well as in the UK."

Last week transgender women were banned from the female category of Ultimate Pool Group (UPG) in response to the Supreme Court ruling.

London Marathon organisers say they will wait for reports from the Equality and Human Rights Commission and Sport England before making any decisions on the categorisation of transgender runners.

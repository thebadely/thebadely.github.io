Here’s what you need to know: The fans involved in the incident can be seen behind the goal

Qarabag's youth team have been fined â¬5,000 (Â£4,379) by Uefa after racist abuse from at least one supporter in an academy match against Chelsea in Azerbaijan.

The youth team have also been ordered to play their next Uefa competition match as host club behind closed doors, though that punishment is suspended for one year.

Arsenal striker Sol Gordon, 17, opened the scoring in the 57th minute at the Azersun Stadium in Baku and celebrated the goal in proximity to a section of fans, who ran down to confront the players in the sparsely attended match.

Eyewitnesses told BBC Sport that they saw and heard monkey gestures.

The Uefa Youth League match on 5 November was stopped for several minutes as players complained to Ukrainian referee Dmytro Kubriak, with coaching staff, including head coach Calum McFarlane, involved in the discussions.

It appeared as if Chelsea might stop playing the match, but they continued after the stoppage and won 5-0.

Chelsea said after the game they had raised the matter with Uefa and added: "We are proud of the way our players and staff responded to the incident on the pitch, swiftly reporting it to the referee, and commend those for dealing with the matter professionally and appropriately in line with Uefa protocols."

A Qarabag spokesperson apologised at the time, saying it "doesn't represent the values of the club", and promising to investigate it "thoroughly".

Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid have also been fined and given a supporter ban because of monkey gestures and noises, and Nazi salutes, during their 4-0 Champions League defeat at Arsenal on 21 October.

Uefa fined the La Liga club â¬30,000 (Â£26,275) and gave them a suspended one-match ban from selling tickets to their fans for an away fixture.

It has been recently reported that Charlie Adam, Paul Hartley and Barrie McKay

The Scottish Cup weekend over, attention returns to the most fascinating Premiership title races in years and what could be one of the key fixtures this coming Sunday.

Surprise leaders Heart of Midlothian host second-top Celtic, with Rangers, third on goal difference, waiting to take advantage as they host Dundee.

Former Rangers midfielder Charlie Adam, one-time Celtic and Hearts midfielder Paul Hartley and Barry McKay, who played on the wing for Hearts and Rangers, all agree it is too close to call and are relishing what is now a three-horse race.

Hartley believes "it's about time" we had "a proper title race" after Celtic were the "dominant force" for most of the past 15 years and that it is "good for Scottish football".

For Adam, "it is wide open", while McKay is "sitting on the fence" about the destination of the silverware.

And all three agree that, although Hearts are in the driving seat, Sunday - and the final two weeks of the transfer window - could be key.

Hearts sit six points clear at the top, but Derek McInnes' side suffered a double blow on Saturday, when they lost on penalties to Falkirk at home in the Scottish Cup and top scorer and captain Lawrence Shankland suffered a worrying injury on top of key midfielder Cammy Devlin's absence.

So how do Hartley, McKay and Adam think the Edinburgh side will respond?

PH: "I didn't think we'd see that coming at the start of the season, but I think Derek's built a good squad. 

"And they've shown such consistency in the league, two defeats. When they've had a defeat, they've always bounced back. 

"You can see the atmosphere at Tynecastle, you can see the anticipation that the supporters have got now and I think they really believe that they can win the league.

"We've been through that period in 2005-06, when we had such a strong start to the season, but this feels totally different. 

"They've got a very good, experienced manager, they're well run, good board and their recruitment has been really good, so you can see the players are believing also.

"You can see the spirit amongst the team and that connection between the supporters and the players you can see that's rubbing off.

"I think Hearts are favourites because of the consistent levels they've shown. 

"Two key players. Devlin's been absolutely outstanding for them. Shankland's the  key player because he's captain, the goals that he can score and his experience in the front line.

"So I think Derek will be praying that the injury's not too bad. But if they are out, it's two important players for them."

BM: "They've put themselves in such a good position where they're probably favourites just now. 

"I think the game at the weekend's obviously massive for them, but I think every time they've had these question marks over them, that they've performed and they've got the result that they needed. 

"I just think they've got a real togetherness there. They've got a real strong core group and they've got really good players.  

"We've got one of the best finishers in the country at the top end of the pitch. They've got a solid defence and really good in the middle of the park and they've that little bit of flair and guile on the sides as well.

"You can't overlook Shankland's goals, but his overall play as well, he's such a clever footballer, he really brings the other ones into play as well. If he is missing, he will be a big miss. 

"They're a real top team and through what you hear on the outside that they're only going to get better as well.

"They've had question marks on them before, they've beat Rangers and Celtic coming away, so it's certainly in them to beat them again.

"I don't see why they can't do it with how they've performed this year."

CA: "I think Hearts have been in unbelievable form in terms of consistency. For a team that's been brought together with a new manager at the start of the season, what Derek's built has been phenomenal.

"The Old Firm teams changing the manager so much this year but still being able to put something together, I think that's down to the quality players that they have."

Celtic manager Martin O'Neill is back for his second spell in interim charge and third tenure overall after the sacking of Wilfried Nancy, who had a dismal spell following Brendan Rodgers' departure in October.

PH: "It's unlike Celtic, isn't it? They've been so successful and then this season has been strange. 

"Having to change manager three times and the recruitment - they're well short of players and I think everybody can see that.

"Martin's getting fed up. Every presser, he's getting asked about player recruitment, strikers.

"Everybody knows that they need strikers, or maybe a striker, and they need some reinforcements in. So it's going to be a big window.

"It's down to who comes out best in the window between the three clubs."

CA: "Martin back in and won the last few games to get a little bit more confidence back is important for them. 

"They need to sign players, probably three, four, five players maybe now in this window."

Rangers have also changed head coach and have thrust themselves back into the title race under Danny Rohl after Russell Martin's early season departure.

CA: "Danny's done a brilliant job. He's understood where Rangers are and what he's done. He's carried himself like a Rangers manager should. He spoke really well in the media.

"Has he played the best football? Probably not, but he's got results and that's key and that's the important bit is winning football matches and he's done that quickly. 

"There's a lot of good feelings around the club and supporters and the owners and they're trying to do the right things. They made mistakes, the owners, and they've owned up to that and they've changed it.

"They've obviously done some good business, but I think they need a goal scorer that can really affect the top end of the pitch for them as well.

"Rangers are happy in the background, doing their business quietly. Obviously they've lost Connor Barron for a number of weeks and bringing in a midfielder was key and they brought a left-back in as well."

BM: "Obviously the manager's come in and he's just brought wins on the board and I think for any manager that's the most important thing. 

"It's brought a real togetherness with the squad and he started to get the fans back onside as well with what he's been doing on the pitch. They've done a wee bit of business quite early as well, which I'm sure he'll be happy with.

"Once you start to see more and more players come in, you'll start to really see his type of team as well. If they can just keep taking care of their own business and winning the games then they'll be right up there.

PH: "Since the new manager comes in, he's done a brilliant job. He's got them organised, he's got them well drilled. So, they're well in the title race. 

"Maybe a few weeks ago, when Hearts beat them, they were out the title race, but now they look like they're really back in it. It's fascinating. "

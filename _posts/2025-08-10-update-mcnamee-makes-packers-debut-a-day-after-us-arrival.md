It has been recently reported that McNamee signed a contract with the Green Bay Packers in July after coming through the International Player Pathway programme

Irish kicker Mark McNamee made his debut for the Green Bay Packers just a day after landing in the United States.

The Dubliner took all three kick-offs for the Packers in a 30-10 NFL pre-season defeat to the New York Jets on Saturday.

The 25-year-old was part of the 2025 International Player Pathway programme and signed a contract with the Packers in July.

Despite this, his arrival in Wisconsin was delayed as he waited to be granted a visa, which he received last week, leading to him landing in the US the night before the game.

"I landed at about 11pm [the night before the game]," he told reporters after the game.

"The Packers and the immigration lawyers have been great with me in just getting it done, it's not an easy thing to get a visa. It felt like a long time, but it was only two weeks. It was really quick and I'm really grateful to be here.

"It feels like it's the beginning, it's a good moment for me and my family."

Elsewhere, Derry native Jude McAtamney kicked a 43-yard field goal and an extra point in the New York Giants' 34-25 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday.

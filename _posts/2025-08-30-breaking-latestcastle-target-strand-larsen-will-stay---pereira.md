Let's dive into the details: Jorgen Strand Larsen scored twice for Wolves in the Carabao Cup win over West Ham on Tuesday night

Wolves head coach Vitor Pereira says striker Jorgen Strand Larsen "will stay with us" after sitting out the loss to Everton amid two rejected bids from Newcastle. 

The 25-year-old was the subject of Â£55m and Â£50m offers from the Magpies - both of which were turned down by Wolves. 

Newcastle, who have signed German Nick Woltemade, are looking for fresh firepower with Alexander Isak trying to engineer a move to Liverpool - the Sweden forward is in a stand-off with the Magpies and is yet to play this season.

Strand Larsen, who only made his loan move from Celta Vigo permanent for Â£23m this summer, sat in the stands at Molineux as Wolves fell to a 3-2 defeat by Everton on Saturday. 

Pereira was quizzed by Sky Sports on whether the Norwegian will still be at the club after Monday's deadline: "I hope so. He is an important player. 

"Today, if he plays, his quality could give us something else. We are not in a situation to sell our best players. 

"The information I have is that he will stay with us."

Wolves do not want to sell the Norway international, primarily because of how little time they would have to find a replacement - with the transfer window closing on Monday - but also because of how valuable Strand Larsen is to their Premier League survival chances.

Pereira told BBC Match of the Day his side "need to bring more players, not to sell players".

With two days until the transfer window shuts, Liverpool are yet to make an improved second offer for Isak after their original Â£110m bid was rejected on 1 August.

Meanwhile, Newcastle are still searching for another forward signing - a deal that could unlock Isak's potential move to Liverpool.

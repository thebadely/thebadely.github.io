Experts revealed that Wing Louis Rees-Zammit made his Wales debut in 2020

New Wales boss Steve Tandy was caught by surprise by Louis Rees-Zammit's return to rugby and has not ruled out a rapid autumn Test comeback.

The 24-year-old winger is seeking a club after ending his bid to become a professional American Football player in the NFL.

His tally of 32 caps means that he will be available for Tandy under Wales' selection policy regardless of his destination.

The head coach, who worked with Rees-Zammit when in charge of defence on the 2021 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, has backed the winger to quickly get back up to speed and be in the mix for November.

Why is it so hard to break into the NFL?

Wales could potentially have some extra firepower out wide when they take on Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa in Cardiff.

"I think you wouldn't rule anything out. Zammo [Rees-Zammit] brings a big effect and excitement by coming back," said Tandy.

"I think it's great for the game. He's gone away to experience something new, which is class, and I'm sure he will be in outstanding physical condition."

Wales went with Josh Adams, Tom Rogers and Keelan Giles as wing options on their summer tour, while Rio Dyer, Ellis Mee, Josh Hathaway and Mason Grady are among the other options for November along with Rees-Zammit.

"The more players we have available to represent our country the better. That's exciting and makes our jobs easier," said Tandy.

"It will also make our calls on selection a lot more challenging in terms of selection as we've already got some very good back-three players. Adding Zammo into that makes it even more exciting for not only us, but the fans as well."

What next for Rees-Zammit after return to rugby?

No 'magic wand' for new Wales boss Tandy

Every Rees-Zammit Six Nations try... so far

Former flanker Tandy was confirmed as Wales' new head coach on 21 July and just 10 days later Rees-Zammit announced his return to rugby.

Tandy was alerted to the news by his 14-year-old daughter, the oldest of three, and the late night social media post started a scramble for his signature.

Rees-Zammit played for Gloucester before his shot at the NFL and is currently weighing up his options for the coming season.

His wage demands and the timing of his return make clubs in France or Japan the leading contenders, while Bristol have also been linked.

The breakaway R360 league is a possibility down the line but Welsh clubs realistically do not have the financial clout to be in the conversation.

However, the winger's return is likely to boost the Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) coffers by driving interest

"I'm over the moon Louis Rees-Zammit is coming back to rugby because it gives us him for the national team. Number one, that's fantastic news," said WRU chief executive Abi Tierney.

"The challenge we've got is we're starting the season in September. You can have a look at what different teams are doing with their salary caps and their players.

"Are we in touch with Louis and trying to find a way in which we can make something work? Of course, it would be fantastic, but I'm sure he'll have lots of other offers as well."

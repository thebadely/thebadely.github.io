Here’s what you need to know: Woods is a 15-time major winner, while Koepka has five

Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka says Tiger Woods was the first person he called to discuss a return to the PGA Tour after leaving LIV Golf.

Koepka joined the lucrative Saudi-Arabian-backed LIV series in 2022, but left in December with one year left on his contract.

The 35-year-old has since rejoined the PGA Tour under a new returning member programme and admitted he was "nervous" as he prepared for his first event back on the series at this week's Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines.

"I think the 23rd [of December] I was released and then called Tiger right away, then that process got the ball rolling," said Koepka.

"I've always had a good relationship with Tiger. That was what I wanted to do once I had the opportunity to, I guess, get reinstated on the PGA Tour.

"It was exciting and I kind of really didn't know what to do. That was the first person that kind of came to mind."

American Woods is a 15-time major winner and chairman of the PGA Tour's Future Competitions Committee.

And Koepka added: "I didn't know [the new PGA Tour commissioner] Brian [Rolapp], I didn't have a relationship with him obviously just because he's pretty new and Jay [Monahan, the previous incumbent] was going to be the next call.

"I felt like Tiger was somebody that I've relied on in the past for questions and answers and how to deal with things and I felt like that was maybe the most comfortable call for me."

Married with a young son, the three-time PGA Championship winner and twice US Open champion said he was leaving LIV Golf to prioritise "the needs of his family".

"I don't regret anything I do," added the Florida-born Koepka, who won nine PGA Tour events during his nine seasons on North America's elite professional circuit.

"I've learned a lot. I've always enjoyed the ride no matter where I'm at."

Speaking about making his return to Torrey Pines in California, he said: "Maybe I'm a little nervous about that as well, just to see, I guess, how the fans respond to it.

"I hope that they're excited. I hope that they're happy that I'm out here. You know, hopefully that goes, at least like the conversations I've had with players, that they're excited that I'm back and happy to see me play."

Rory McIlroy recently suggested Koepka's return to the PGA Tour could mean the rival LIV Golf tour was in decline.

But the Northern Irishman has now added the decision could also have been motivated by the level of competition.

"He obviously is a very competitive person and wants to compete at the highest level," said McIlroy, 36.

"I think he made the decision that he thought competing at the highest level meant coming back to the PGA Tour.

"It seems like some of those guys [on the LIV tour] are maybe starting to realise that they're not getting everything that they wanted out of going over there, and that's obviously a great thing for the PGA Tour."

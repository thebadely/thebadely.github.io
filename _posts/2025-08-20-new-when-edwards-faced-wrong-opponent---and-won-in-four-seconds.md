According to new developments, Edwards has won 15 of his 19 professional fights

Fabian Edwards leans back in his chair and laughs when he thinks of his very first fight as an amateur in 2015.

"I'm in the back getting warmed up and I'm told my opponent is on the motorway, he's on his way," Edwards tells BBC Sport.

"When the time comes for me to make the walk, I got in the cage and I'm like, 'Who's this'? There's a random person in the cage - a completely different person."

Edwards says the opponent he was scheduled to fight that evening in his hometown, Birmingham, did not show up so the promoters found a replacement on the night.

Edwards only found out when he stepped in the cage and was faced with someone he did not recognise.

"I looked at my team and they were like, 'Just carry on'. We touched gloves and unfortunately for him it was over in four seconds," added Edwards.

"That's probably my craziest fight story."

Edwards' story is not too dissimilar to the bedlam and confusion other fighters have experienced at amateur level in MMA.

Bouts are often fought for little to no prize money, with fighters aiming to gain experience and gauge whether they could succeed as a pro.

On Thursday in Hollywood, Florida, Edwards' amateur career will feel like a lifetime ago when he faces American Dalton Rosta in the final of the PFL's annual middleweight tournament. 

The winner will receive a $500,000 (Â£369,000) prize. 

"I'm not sat here thinking about the money. More so the opportunity is big," said Edwards, 32.

"Since the tournament started, I said I'm going to win it. Everything I said I was going to do, I've done in this tournament. I said I'm going to stop Dalton and that's what I truly believe."

Edwards is looking to follow in the footsteps of fellow Briton Alfie Davis, who won the PFL's lightweight tournament last week.

Despite the contest not yielding an official world title, Edwards says he is treating it like a championship bout.

Edwards has suffered defeat twice before by Johnny Eblen for the Bellator middleweight title in 2023 and 2024, but has rebuilt himself this year with two successive wins.

Edwards laughs jovially when asked if he knew a career in MMA would bring so many highs and lows.

"I thought it would be all highs, especially when I was undefeated for six years or so," he says.

"But I've suffered a few losses now and I understand it's the game. Even the greats have losses, most of them, so if they can go through it and still go on to become greats and champions, then why can't we?"

Should Edwards have beaten Eblen in 2023, he would have joined his older brother Leon Edwards, who at the time held the UFC's welterweight belt, as a world champion.

Edwards' defeat was followed by Leon, 33, losing his title to Belal Muhammad the following year - losses which challenged morale at their gym in Birmingham.

"It did affect it a bit but at the same time, the guys understand it's the game," said Edwards.

"What it does show the guys in the gym is I've suffered big defeats and I've come back. 

"And Leon as well â he's back in the gym, he's coaching the guys, he's not hidden away somewhere. It's showing the guys that life moves on."

Edwards can sum up how he has learned to bounce back from defeats with one word: "Gratitude."

"If I lose a massive fight, I look at my overall life and it's great â I've got healthy kids, my family is healthy and I've got a lovely home," said Edwards.

"Life isn't over after defeat. I think, 'This stings, it really does', but my life is alright and I can go again - and that's what I've proved."

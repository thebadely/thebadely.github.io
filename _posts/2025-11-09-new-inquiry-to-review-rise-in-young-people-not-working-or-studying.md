Experts revealed that An independent review into the rising number of young people not working or studying is being launched by the government.

Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will lead the inquiry into "Neets" - the acronym for young people who are not in education, employment or training.

According to Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden, the persistently high number of 16-24 year olds falling out of education or work is a "crisis of opportunity" requiring urgent action. 

It is not a new problem but the number of young people who are Neet - now one in eight - has been rising in recent years and is approaching one million.

A quarter cite long-term sickness or disability as a barrier and the number claiming health and disability benefits is rising too. 

The government says Alan Milburn's review will dig into the reasons behind the rise and examine ways of cutting the long-term costs of youth inactivity and getting young people off benefits and into work.

Its conclusions will be published next summer. 

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called the broader benefits system unsustainable and unfair but so far selling welfare reform to Labour backbenchers has proved a political minefield for Number 10.

According to the Department of Work and Pensions, the number of young people claiming Universal Credit (UC) Health and Employment Support Allowance has risen by more than 50% over the past five years. 

Some 80% of young people on the UC Health element currently cite mental health reasons or a neurodevelopmental condition.

Asked whether he thought over-diagnosis was fuelling a mental health crisis among young people, McFadden was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: "I don't want to play amateur doctor. I want to approach this with sensitivity.

"The question I'm asking is, given the higher reported number of these conditions among young people, what is the best policy response? I don't believe there should be an automatic link between diagnosis and benefits."

"If we get this right," he added, "the prize is huge: transforming lives and life chances, with the pent-up potential of the next generation firing our economy and building a better future for all.

"We cannot afford to lose a generation of young people to a life on benefits, with no work prospects and not enough hope."

Milburn said his review would be "uncompromising", and expose any failings in employment support, education, skills, health and welfare.

"We cannot stand by and let a generation of young people be consigned to a life without employment or prospects," he said. "It's clear urgent action is needed."

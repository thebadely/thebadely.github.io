Experts revealed that Targeted raids on high street premises such as mini-marts, vape shops, barbers and takeaways have seen more than 920 people arrested, in the largest action of its kind coordinated by the National Crime Agency (NCA).

More than 340 notices for illegal working and renting were issued by authorities, which could see businesses and landlords fined tens of thousands of pounds.

Last week the BBC exposed Kurdish crime fixers who claimed to be able to make £60,000 illegal working fines disappear. 

The BBC's reporting also uncovered a Kurdish criminal network using "ghost directors" to represent companies' official paperwork while remaining uninvolved in day-to-day operations.

Undercover journalists posing as asylum seekers were told how easy it was to take over a shop and make thousands of pounds a week from illegal tobacco.

The Home Office said it would investigate the BBC's findings.

The NCA led the month-long crackdown – which saw 2,734 high street premises visited and over £10.7m criminal proceeds seized, including millions of illegal tobacco and vapes, over half a million pounds in cash and 70kg of cannabis.

The illicit tobacco alone equates to more than £3.5m worth of duty evaded, the NCA estimates.

Over 450 registered businesses have been referred to Companies House for further investigation.

"Thousands of officers have been deployed up and down our country, targeting criminal profits and the means of generating them," Rachael Herbert, director of the national economic crime centre at the NCA, said.

"Hundreds of thousands of harmful and illegal products have been taken off our streets, and over £10m in cash, frozen in bank accounts and criminal assets seized."

The NCA estimates that at least £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, which is typically smuggled out of the country or siphoned through financial systems to be reinvested in criminal enterprise.

Senior politicians have warned that a UK-wide criminal network uncovered by the BBC is acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.

The BBC also understands that 25 Labour MPs have joined a campaign to "shut down dodgy shops" following concerns in their constituencies.

The group, led by Melanie Onn, MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, is calling for new legislative powers and tougher penalties for offenders.

Home Office security minister Dan Jarvis said: "Criminals are using these dodgy shops as fronts for serious organised crime, money laundering and illegal working, risking the future of the British high street.

"We have intensified our joint efforts with law enforcement to dismantle criminal networks and relentlessly pursue those who use dirty money for personal gain."

October was the second month-long intensification of high street visits since March this year, under the NCA's Operation Machinize.

The joint action saw every police force in the UK work with partners including Trading Standards, HM Revenue & Customs and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.

The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CSTI), which represents officers working in councils across the UK, told the BBC: "The threat of serious and organised crime on our high streets was identified as the number one threat facing our members."

CSTI would like officers' resources and powers to close businesses strengthened as a result.

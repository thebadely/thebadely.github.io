Here’s what you need to know: The home secretary's personal account of the racial discrimination she faces, which she revealed in stark terms in yesterday's Commons debate on asylum, makes the front pages of the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph. "Racist abuse that means I know broken asylum system must be fixed" is the headline in the Mail. The Telegraph goes with "Mahmood turns air blue in blast at liberals" - and says the "outburst" shows how "vicious" the debate is set to become.

The Times calls the government's proposals "brave and radical" - but says Labour's survival depends on the plans working. The Sun's editorial says "The public wants to see results and real changes, not just tough talk". The Guardian believes angry Labour backbenchers opposed to the plans will provide a "major challenge" to the prime minister's authority. In his parliamentary sketch, John Crace says most Labour MPs "looked genuinely queasy in the Commons ".

Sir Keir Starmer has given an interview to the Daily Mirror, which he says he has vowed to lead Labour into the next general election. He has told the paper that "Every minute that's not spent dealing with the cost of living is a minute wasted of the political work of this government".

The Daily Mail says warning stickers have been placed on the dashboards of hundreds of Ministry of Defence vehicles, because of Chinese spying fears. The vehicles are used to move troops and equipment around in the UK and overseas, and both drivers and passengers are being warned not to connect devices to the bluetooth. The Financial Times also has a story about hacking. It says cyber security experts have warned the government that banning hospitals and airports from paying ransoms could result in essential services collapsing.

A number of the papers pick up Pierce Brosnan's comments that he would consider returning to the James Bond franchise, suggesting he might play a retired agent. "Tomorrow never dies" says the Telegraph. The Daily Express notes that Sean Connery quit the role before making a comeback. It advises all former 007 stars to "Never say the never word, ever again".

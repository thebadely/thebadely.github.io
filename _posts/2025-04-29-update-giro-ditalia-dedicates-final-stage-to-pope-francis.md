It has been recently reported that Pope Francis was the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church

The final stage of this year's Giro d'Italia will feature a "symbolic start" from the Vatican City in Rome to pay tribute to the late Pope Francis.

The final stage in Rome on 1 June will begin with a neutralised start - a non-competitive segment where the riders cycle slowly before the race begins - that will pass through the Vatican City before leaving through Porta del Perugino.

The 21st and final stage of the Giro, which begins in Albania on 9 May, will then start officially and include eight loops of a 9.5 km circuit on the streets of Rome.

Pope Francis died aged at the age of 88 on 21 April.

"This presence is renewed this year with an exciting symbolic start from Vatican City, a tribute to Pope Francis, his persona, and his message of hope in the Jubilee year," Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri said.

This will be the third consecutive time the Giro has ended in Rome, but only the seventh time in 108 editions of the race.

The Giro has passed through Vatican City on two previous occasions.

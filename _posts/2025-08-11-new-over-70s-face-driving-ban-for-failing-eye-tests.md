According to new developments, Motorists over 70 could be banned from the roads if they fail compulsory eye tests, as part of a radical shake-up of driving laws in England and Wales.

The two countries' drink-driving limit is also set to be tightened to be in line with Scotland's, with penalty points to be introduced for passengers not wearing a seatbelt.

The changes are expected to be included in a new road safety strategy set to be published by the government in the autumn, with ministers believing that the current safety messaging is not working.

The move comes after an inquest into four deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight saw a coroner call the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe".

Plans currently being prepared by the transport secretary include a new requirement for the over-70s to take eye tests every three years when they renew their driving licence.

Tests for conditions like dementia are also under consideration.

"In no other circumstance would we accept 1,600 people dying, with thousands more seriously injured, costing the NHS more than Â£2bn per year," a government source told the BBC.

"This Labour government will deliver the first Road Safety Strategy in a decade, imposing tougher penalties on those breaking the law, protecting road users and restoring order to our roads," the source added.

In April, HM Senior Coroner for Lancashire Dr James Adeley sent a report to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander to say action should be taken to prevent future deaths, after he found enforcement of visual legal standards for drivers was unsafe.

According to his report, the UK is one of only three European countries to rely on self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the ability to drive.

Following the inquest, a source close to the transport secretary told the BBC the government accepted that the rules "need to be reassessed".

Apart from eyesight concerns, the government is also looking into stricter rules for drink driving.

Under the new plans, the drink-drive limit is expected to be tightened from 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath to 22 micrograms, which would match limits already set for Scotland.

Other proposals under consideration could also see police allowed to rely on roadside saliva tests for evidence of drug-driving rather than blood tests, making it easier to prosecute suspects.

There had been "a catastrophic rise" in deaths caused solely by alcohol in England over the past four years, according to government figures from late last year.

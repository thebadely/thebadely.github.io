Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Nathan Aspinall is currently ranked 23rd in the world 

Nathan Aspinall threw two nine-dart finishes during the Players Championship 31 only to be blown away in the final - as Luke Littler suffered an early exit.

Aspinall, 34, produced perfect darts in a 6-4 victory over Irishman Steve Lennon in the second round, then repeated the feat in a 6-5 win over Germany's Lukas Wenig in the last 16.

Englishman Aspinall had taken a 2-0 lead against Jermaine Wattimena of the Netherlands in the final in Wigan.

However, Wattimena reeled off eight legs on the bounce to clinically see off Aspinall and seal his second ranking title of the season.

Luke Littler, on the back of a semi-final defeat by Beau Greaves in the World Youth Championship on Monday, suffered a first-round exit as he lost 6-4 to fellow Englishman Ritchie Edhouse.

The 18-year-old world champion is currently 67th in the Players Championship standings, external and has three events to secure his place in the top 64 to qualify for the finals.

Michael van Gerwen is also in danger of not qualifying after he was knocked out at the same stage with a 6-4 loss to Dom Taylor.

The Dutchman is 92nd in table and must now make the final in the Players Championship 32 on Wednesday to secure his spot because he is skipping the final two events because of a pre-booked holiday.  

There are 34 Players Championship events across the year, with the competition's finals held in Minehead from 21-23 November.

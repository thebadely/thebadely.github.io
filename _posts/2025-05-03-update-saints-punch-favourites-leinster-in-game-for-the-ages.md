Let's dive into the details: Northampton Saints beat Leinster to reach their first Champions Cup final since 2011

"We punched them in the face."

Alex Mitchell's reference to an act of violence after 80 minutes of compelling European rugby at Aviva Stadium may have delivered an element of surprise.

It was, however, an emotive reflection which suitably matched a Northampton Saints performance that left Leinster with more than a bloodied nose in their Investec Champions Cup semi-final. 

Fuelled with vengeance for last year's defeat at the same stage and a quiet confidence amid a backdrop of external doubt, the reigning Premiership champions produced the knockout blow to end Leinster's pursuit of a fifth star on the jersey - a stunning 37-34 win.

"A couple of pundits were saying they're going to win by 20-30 points and that Saints won't score a point," Saints and England scrum-half Mitchell told RTE.

"We showed up today and were a bit more fearless this time around. Last year, we were waiting to see what Leinster were going to do.

"We showed up today and the first 20 minutes, we punched them in the face. They weren't really expecting that. Credit to the boys, we got the result."

Confidence in Leinster reaching a fourth consecutive final from fans and pundits alike was well-founded.

The Irish province pitched up at their vociferous Dublin home without having conceded a point in thumping knockout victories over Harlequins and United Rugby Championship title-holders Glasgow Warriors.

Saints, though, had not read the script. 

England wing Tommy Freeman scored a first-half hat-trick to extend his tally to seven tries in his past three Champions Cup appearances and further strengthen his claim for British and Irish Lions selection, while Henry Pollock's star continues to rise after his searing try.

The hosts responded after half-time, but, somewhat uncharacteristically, lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead, while Saints were able to negate Leinster's blitz defence once more as James Ramm scored their fifth try.

Ireland wing James Lowe dragged his side to within three points to set up a thrilling finale but, after referee Pierre Brousset awarded Leinster a late penalty instead of a try, Northampton salvaged possession with a last-gasp turnover camped on their own line before kicking the ball dead.

Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson was a member of the playing squad the last time the club overcame Leinster in 2013, but the former back row's masterminding of their latest victory is perhaps the greatest of his coaching career.

"Lots of people wrote us off and we understood we were underdogs but the belief within the group was outstanding," Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton. 

"I would hate to think what my blood pressure was doing at the end but the last defensive set spoke volumes about our group, about the lads coming on and their impact. We got the turnover, killed the clock and cue the wild scenes in the coaching box.

"We have had experience before of playing into a press defence. We had practised playing through it and we revisited those principles. There were more opportunities we could've taken but we took enough to get on the scoresheet."

Northampton stun Leinster in Dublin to reach final

When is the British and Irish Lions squad named?

Saints' biggest test remains against either Bordeaux-Begles or six-time winners Toulouse in this season's showpiece in Cardiff, but if this victory is the greatest of Dowson's era so far, his greatest servant could yet prove to be the influential Pollock, who is still remarkably in his debut campaign as a senior player.

The young back row, 20, has broken into Northampton's side, made his England Test debut and is a contender for Lions selection just 12 months on from watching last season's defeat at Croke Park in fancy dress as a supporter. 

"That was a battle. I have never played in a game that hard in my life," Pollock told Premier Sports.

"That is what dreams are made of. 

"As a boy I grew up watching this competition and to get to the final with my boyhood club, I'm emotional speaking about it. 

"After the last two performances these Leinster boys had, to come here with no fear, we have been saying all week, 'Why not us?'."

Pollock's all-round performance belied his level of experience, while his try demonstrated the physical prowess of a back as he launched on to Mitchell's flat pass from a standing start to glide through a hole in Leinster's defence, before sprinting around final defender Sam Prendergast.

Asked about applying two fingers to his neck in celebration, an enthused Pollock added: "I was just feeling that pulse. 

"This is why you play the game, because you love it. The fans, the sport, going up against the best back row in the world was amazing. Bring on Cardiff."

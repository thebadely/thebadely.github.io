It has been recently reported that Liam Manning was appointed by Norwich City on 3 June

Norwich City have sacked head coach Liam Manning following a seventh successive  home defeat, which has left them second bottom of the Championship.   

The 40-year-old was appointed in June, having guided Bristol City to the play-offs last season, but lasted just 17 games. 

His final match in charge was Saturday's 2-1 loss against Leicester City. They have not won in 11 and have lost eight in a row at home in league and cup.

"We have tried absolutely everything possible to work through this incredibly challenging period but, unfortunately, given the recent run of results and performances, we have been left with no choice other than to make a change at this stage," said sporting director Ben Knapper.

"Liam and his staff worked tirelessly to move our football club forward. They are all fundamentally good people and we wish them the very best in whatever comes next."

First-team coach Ryan Garry has been put in interim charge, assisted by goalkeeper coach Tony Roberts and set-piece coach Nick Stanley.

There were protests outside Carrow Road following Saturday's game, with fans chanting "You're not fit to wear the shirt" and also calling for Knapper to leave the club.

It is the first time a team in the second tier of English football has ever lost their first seven home league games in a season.

Knapper added: "We very much understand the frustration and criticism from our supporters at this stage. So far, results and performances on the pitch haven't been good enough.

"We accept that responsibility, but it's now imperative that we start to repair the relationship with our supporters and do everything we can to give them something to get behind."

Manning leaves Norwich 23rd in the table, the Canaries having lost 10 of their 15 Championship games under him, including a 3-1 defeat at Ipswich, their first loss in an East Anglia derby for 16 years.

They are now looking for their fifth permanent boss since Daniel Farke - now in charge at Leeds United - left in November 2021, having twice led them to promotion to the Premier League.

Manning was recruited after Norwich decided not to give the job to former England midfielder Jack Wilshere, who was in interim charge for the final two games of last season and is now manager at Luton Town.

Manning was born in Norwich and played in their academy before switching briefly to Ipswich and then dropping into non-league football.

He began his coaching career with Belgian club Lommel and had spells in charge at MK Dons and Oxford United before joining Bristol City in November 2023.

The Norwich squad was transformed by 12 signings during the summer transfer window, but the club sold Borja Sainz, who supplied 18 goals last season, to Porto for Â£14.25m, and Marcelino Nunez to rivals Ipswich for Â£10m.

United States international Josh Sargent scored six goals in five league and cup games at the start of the campaign but has none in the past 11 - and no-one else has managed more than Mathias Kvistgaarden and Jovon Makama's three.

In his final post-match interview with BBC Radio Norfolk, Manning - who was recently given the public backing of majority shareholder Mark Attanasio - said: "I don't live my life with regrets, it's part of my journey. 

"I'm learning, I'm hurting, I'm frustrated and I'm hugely disappointed, because this is a club I care deeply about.

"I didn't come here to be where we are. But we are, so I will do a lot of learning as to why."

His assistant Chris Hogg and analyst James Krause have also left the club.

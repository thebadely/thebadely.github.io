It has been recently reported that Joao Palhinha made just six Bundesliga starts last season

Tottenham have signed Bayern Munich midfielder Joao Palhinha on a season-long loan deal.

The 30-year-old, who joined the German side from Fulham in 2024, was limited to just 17 Bundesliga appearances last season.

Spurs boss Thomas Frank was keen to sign a defensive-minded midfielder following his appointment, with question marks over the futures of Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur.

Tottenham also have the option of signing Palhinha on a permanent basis at the end of his loan. 

The Portugal international has significant Premier League experience, making 68 top-flight appearances in two years at Fulham before his move to Bayern for Â£42.3m.

Palhinha comfortably topped the rankings for tackles with a total of 300 during his previous stint in the English top-flight - 109 more than any other player - and ranked sixth for interceptions (92).

His combative style of play, however, does carry risks having received 27 yellow cards across 2022-23 and 2023-24 - at least five more than anyone else.

Palhinha becomes Spurs' third summer signing, following the Â£55m acquisition of Mohammed Kudus and French forward Mathys Tel's arrival from Bayern on a permanent basis after a loan spell.

Joao Palhinha can be a fantastic addition to Tottenham.

The move could help provide balance to a very creative and attack-minded midfield and offer a security line to the team's backline and defensive approach.

He is a very good defensive-minded midfielder and his physical ability and presence will be perfect for the Premier League.

Palhinha's ability to win tackles and aerial duels can also be very valuable.

His leadership qualities have been appreciated by his team-mates at Bayern, and no doubt these will be welcomed by Thomas Frank, too.

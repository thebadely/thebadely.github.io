It has been recently reported that Former England football captain David Beckham has been awarded a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours, as have actor Gary Oldman and musician Roger Daltrey.  

UK Honours typically celebrate the contribution of well-known personalities, government employees and ordinary people who have served their community.

Most UK honours are awarded on the monarch's official birthday in June and at the new year. 

The 2025 Birthday Honours also made Dames of author Pat Barker and singer Elaine Page, while Strictly Come Dancing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman were awarded OBEs. 

The reality TV personality Georgia Harrison was made an MBE for her work on online privacy after her former partner was jailed for sharing a video of them having sex.

In the most recent New Year Honours, actor Stephen Fry, former England football manager Gareth Southgate and London Mayor Sadiq Khan were among those knighted.

The list also included an MBE for Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, and CBEs for services to drama for actresses Sarah Lancashire and Carey Mulligan.

Dissolution honours are typically given to politicians when Parliament ends before a general election. 

Outgoing prime ministers can also award resignation honours. 

Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak named 36 people in his resignation honours list - most of whom were high-profile former Conservative ministers, and advisors. 

Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both issued resignation honours when they left office in 2022.

Johnson's controversial list initially contained eight names rejected by the body which approves appointments to the House of Lords. 

Truss was widely criticised for submitting an honours list after only 49 days in the job.

The New Year and King's Birthday honours are awarded by the King following recommendations by the prime minister or senior government ministers.

Members of the public can also recommend people for an award. These nominations typically make up about a quarter of all recommendations.

Honours' lists include awards for people who:

Resignation and dissolution honours are decided by the relevant prime minister and do not go through the same process.

The Foreign Office has responsibility for the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List. Honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the foreign secretary.

Honours are traditionally kept confidential until the official announcement.

Honours are typically awarded by the King, Prince of Wales or Princess Royal, at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or the Palace of Holyroodhouse.

Recipients can select their investiture's date and location but not which member of the Royal Family will preside over the ceremony.

British Empire Medals are presented locally by lord-lieutenants, who represent the King.

People in line for an honour are checked by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat, which is part of the Cabinet Office government department.

The Cabinet Office has agreements with other government departments to let it access confidential information about nominees.

For example, HMRC provides a low, medium or high-risk rating on a nominee's tax affairs.

Peerages are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission.

A Parliamentary and Political Services Committee considers honours for politicians and for political service.

When somebody is approved for an honour, they are sent a letter asking if they will accept it.

A list of 277 people who turned down honours between 1951 and 1999 - and subsequently died - was made public following a BBC Freedom of Information request.

It included authors Roald Dahl, JG Ballard and Aldous Huxley, and painters Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud and LS Lowry.

The late poet Benjamin Zephaniah rejected an OBE in 2003 because of the association with the British Empire and its history of slavery.

Some people have had their honours withdrawn by the Honours Forfeiture Committee.

They include disgraced former entertainer Rolf Harris, who went to prison for 12 indecent assaults on four girls, and Anthony Blunt, the former art adviser to the Queen who was revealed to be a Soviet spy.

In January 2024, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells said she would hand back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal.

Twelve months earlier, actor and TV presenter Alan Cumming returned his OBE over what he called the "toxicity" of the British Empire.

Knights and Dames

The honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood - the accolade, or the touch of a sword, by the sovereign.

A knight is styled "Sir" and their wife "Lady".

Women receiving the honour are styled "Dame" but do not receive the accolade.

The honour is given for a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity.

The rank of Knight Commander (KBE) or Dame Commander (DBE), Order of the British Empire, appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list.

The Order of the Bath

The Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre.

It has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB).

The Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which, in former times, was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood.

Order of St Michael and St George

This Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth.

Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG).

Order of the Companions of Honour

This is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients are entitled to put the initials CH after their name.

Orders of the British Empire

King George V created these honours during World War One to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and service personnel in support positions.

The ranks are Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE).

They are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles, and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity.

British Empire Medal (BEM)

The medal was founded in 1917 and was awarded for "meritorious" actions by civilians or military personnel, although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture.

Scrapped in 1993 by Conservative Prime Minister John Major, the BEM was revived in 2012.

Royal Victorian Order

By 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system.

In response, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on behalf of the Royal Family.

The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO).

Royal Victorian Medal

Associated with the Royal Victorian Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze. The circular medal is attached to the ribbon of the Order.

Royal Red Cross

Founded in 1883 by Queen Victoria, the award is confined to the nursing services. Those awarded the First Class are designated "Members" (RRC): those awarded the Second Class are designated "Associates" (ARRC).

King's Police Medal

Awarded for distinguished service in the police force.

King's Fire Service Medal

Given to firefighters who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty.

Let's dive into the details: Conor Bradley left Emirates Stadium on crutches and with a knee brace

Liverpool defender Conor Bradley has been ruled out for the rest of the domestic season after suffering a significant knee injury, involving damage to bone and ligament.

The 22-year-old was forced off during Thursday's 0-0 Premier League draw at Arsenal after landing awkwardly near the touchline when chasing the ball in stoppage time.

The injury is not related to his anterior cruciate ligament, but he will have surgery in the coming days.

The full-back is also now a major doubt for the World Cup should Northern Ireland qualify.

He will miss their difficult play-off semi-final in Italy on 26 March and any subsequent play-off final.

Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli later apologised for trying to push Bradley off the pitch when he was down injured.

Martinelli dropped the ball on his opponent before shoving him in the back in an attempt to get him off the playing surface to allow the game to continue.

That action sparked a melee between the two sets of players, with Martinelli and Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate both yellow-carded for their involvement.

Gabriel Martinelli later issued an apology on social media, saying the two players had been in contact and he had already said sorry

'Idiot' or 'understandable'? Martinelli apologises for pushing Bradley

Former Manchester United players Gary Neville and Roy Keane were both highly critical of Martinelli on Sky Sports, with Neville saying his actions were "absolutely disgraceful" and describing the Arsenal winger as an "idiot".

"I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment," Martinelli posted on Instagram.

"I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery."

Since Trent Alexander-Arnold left for Real Madrid in the summer, Bradley has been Liverpool's first choice right-back, starting 12 of their Premier League games this season.

Manager Arne Slot's potential alternatives are limited with Joe Gomez able to play there, while Dominik Szoboszlai has also slotted in as a full-back on occasion.

The more likely option is Jeremie Frimpong, who has been performing further forward down the right flank in recent weeks.

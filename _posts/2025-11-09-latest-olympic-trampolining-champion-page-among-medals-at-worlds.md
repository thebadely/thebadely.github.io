Experts revealed that Bryony Page (second from left) won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics

Olympic champion Bryony Page won silver and bronze medals as British gymnasts enjoyed a successful Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships in Spain.

Page, 34, won silver in the women's synchro event alongside partner Isabelle Songhurst on Sunday, to go with the bronze she won earlier in the mixed all-around team event.

GB athletes won five medals in total, external in an event dominated by China.

Songhurst and Page were joined by Megan Kealy, Omo Aikeremiokha, Corey Walkes, Zak Perzamanos, Kristof Willerton and Kirsty Way for their all-around bronze, with China taking gold.

Mori Hikaru and Tanaka Saki of Japan won gold ahead of Page and Songhurst in the women's synchro, while Way won bronze for Britain in the women's double mini event - her first individual world medal.

Way, Kim Beattie and Molly McKenna took silver in the women's team double mini on Friday and Megan Kealy, Jaeda-Lei Jeffers and Naana Oppon also won silver in the women's team tumbling.

Page had less success in the individual trampoline event, eliminated in the semi-finals with a score lower than usual because of an issue with her difficulty.

She and her coaching team appealed against the score, which went unchanged.

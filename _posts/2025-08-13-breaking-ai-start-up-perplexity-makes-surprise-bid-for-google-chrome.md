Here’s what you need to know: Artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Perplexity has made a surprise $34.5bn (£25.6bn) takeover bid for Google's Chrome internet browser.

Moving Chrome to an independent operator committed to user safety would benefit the public, Perplexity said in a letter to Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google's owner Alphabet.

But one technology industry investor called the offer a "stunt" that is a much lower than Chrome's true value and highlighted it is not clear whether the platform is even for sale.

The BBC has contacted Google for comment. The firm has not announced any plans to sell Chrome - the world's most popular web browser with an estimated three billion-plus users.

Google's dominance of the search engine and online advertising market has come under intense scrutiny, with the technology giant embroiled in years of legal wrangling as part of two antitrust cases.

A US federal judge is expected to issue a ruling this month that could see Google being ordered to break up its search business.

The company has said it would appeal such a ruling, saying the idea of spinning off Chrome was an "unprecedented proposal" that would harm consumers and security.

A spokesman for Perplexity told the BBC that its bid marks an "important commitment to the open web, user choice, and continuity for everyone who has chosen Chrome."

As part of the proposed takeover, Perplexity said it would continue to have Google as the default search engine within Chrome, though users could adjust their settings.

The firm said it would also maintain and support Chromium, a widely-used open-source platform that supports Chrome and other browsers including Microsoft Edge and Opera.

Perplexity did not respond to queries about how the proposed deal would be funded. In July, it had an estimated value of $18bn.

Technology industry investor and start-up founder Heath Ahrens called Perplexity's move a "stunt, and nowhere near Chrome's true value, given its unmatched data and reach."

"The offer isn't serious, but if someone like Sam Altman or Elon Musk tripled it, they could genuinely secure dominance for their AI," he added.

It is also not clear whether Google is considering selling the platform, Tomasz Tunguz  from Theory Ventures told the BBC.

He also said the offer is a lot lower than the browser is worth "given the value of Chrome is likely significantly higher – maybe ten times more valuable than the bid or more."

Perplexity's app is among the rising players in the generative AI race, alongside more well-known platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.

Last month, it launched an AI-powered browser called Comet. 

The company made headlines earlier this year after offering to buy the American version of TikTok, which faces a deadline in September to be sold by its Chinese owner or be banned in the US.

Perplexity has reportedly drawn interest from technology giants including Apple and Facebook-owner Meta.

Experts revealed that Luke Littler has never won the Players Championship

World champion Luke Littler reached the Players Championship quarter-finals with a 10-6 win over Ricardo Pietreczko in Minehead.

Littler, 18, came from 5-3 down against the German to set up a meeting with fellow Englishman Chris Dobey at Butlin's on Sunday.

"This is one I've not won and everyone does know that," Littler told ITV.

"I'm definitely chasing for it, so hopefully I can come back tomorrow and get another win."

Littler averaged 102.67 to Pietreczko's 90.41 and threw six maximum 180s to his opponent's two.

"I am never happy when I am losing. At 3-2 down, I then got it back to 5-5 and I just had to kick on there," Littler said.

"I managed to get the job done. I was not the best on my doubles tonight, but I can sharpen up on them again tomorrow afternoon."

Littler reached the last 16 earlier on Saturday with a 6-3 win against Englishman Ross Smith.

Wales' Gerwyn Price beat Poland's Sebastian Bialecki 6-1 and German Martin Schindler 10-6 to move into the quarter-finals.

He will play Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney, while England's Nathan Aspinall meets Northern Ireland's Josh Rock, and Englishman James Wade faces the Netherlands' Jermaine Wattimena.

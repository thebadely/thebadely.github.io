Slot thanks Klopp after title win

Liverpool manager Arne Slot paid tribute to his predecessor Jurgen Klopp moments after his side won the Premier League title.

The Reds defeated Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 at Anfield on Sunday to clinch a record-equalling 20th top-flight title, with Slot becoming the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League.

"It feels great. I don't think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp," Slot, who replaced Klopp as Liverpool manager last summer, told LFCTV.

The 46-year-old immediately launched into a rendition of the song Klopp asked Liverpool fans to sing after his final game last May, but replaced the lyrics 'Arne Slot' with 'Jurgen Klopp'.

"I am 99.9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen," he told BBC Match of the Day.

"So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact. I think he showed last season what a wonderful human being he is by introducing me. 

"But what mattered most is the team he left behind that was able to win the trophy."

Slot, speaking to Sky Sports, added: "The work Jurgen and Pep [Lijnders] did - the culture, work-rate, quality - was outstanding,"

Few expected Slot to oversee a successful title charge in his first season at Anfield, not least the man himself.

"We started really well and maybe it helped that [Manchester] City had a difficult spell that they have not had in five years," he said.

"When the season started, we would have been happy with top four. But I don't think that is fair on the players as they are much better than that and they have shown it this season."

Dominic Solanke gave Spurs a surprise lead at Anfield, but Slot had no doubts his side would turn things around.

"I think from the moment we arrived on the bus everyone could feel that we were never going to lose this game," he told BBC Match of the Day.

"The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line."

He told LFCTV: "They always find a way to win. I'm incredibly proud, not only of the players but the people standing here, sport directors, my staff members, we should give them a big round of applause.

"Let's forget it's the second title in 35 years... it's the second in five years."

Liverpool last won the Premier League five years ago, but the Coronavirus pandemic meant there were no fans inside Anfield to witness it.

For fans and players alike, a first title win in front of supporters since 1990 is something special.

"It's special to win it at Anfield - it's very difficult to describe," Mohamed Salah told BBC Sport.

"Everyone wanted Palace to finish it [at Arsenal on Wednesday], but I know what Anfield is like, so I'm glad we did it here.

"It's completely different [to the title in 2020]. The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible."

Salah told Sky Sports: "This is 100% better than last time."

Virgil van Dijk - the first non-British captain to lead Liverpool to a top flight title - dedicated the triumph to the club's supporters.

"I was desperate to win it for them [the fans] and all the fans around the world, and for us as well," Van Dijk told Sky Sports.

"This is the most beautiful club in the world. We deserve this. We are going to enjoy the next couple of weeks and take it in."

Left-back Andy Robertson was also a member of the 2019-20 title-winning team, and he has now become just the third Scotsman to win multiple Premier League titles after Darren Fletcher and Brian McClair.

"Last time [we won the league in 2020] was a strange time," he told Sky Sports.

"It was unique the way we did it. We enjoyed it of course but you cannot beat what we experienced today. Nothing compares to that.

"It is special. For me, when I came to this club I quickly realised how good Scottish players have been here. There is a bit of pressure with that. I am glad I managed to continue that and hopefully can carry that forward."

It has been a remarkable few years for midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina before joining Liverpool in 2023.

"To win a World Cup and now a Premier League is really special," he said. 

"But it would not be possible without my team-mates. I am just one part of the puzzle. This team has been really good the last two years. 

"It wasn't enough last year but this year we made a big difference. Hopefully we can enjoy this week."

Despite uncertainty regarding his future hanging over him for much of this season, Salah has been sensational.

His 63rd-minute goal on Sunday was his 28th of the season, while he has set up another 18 for his team-mates.

"It's incredible. Winning the Premier League and having the impact I've had is incredible," Salah told BBC Match of the Day.

"For me, this [title] feels more special. Jurgen [Klopp] is not here and other players I respect a lot are not here, but to do it with a new manager and a new team shows what I'm capable of."

Defending their title will not be easy, but having committed his immediate future to the club with a new two-year contract earlier this month, Salah is confident.

"People think it's going to get easier, but now it's going to be difficult because other teams will catch us and it's going to be harder for him [Slot]," he said. 

"Even in my time here, the second season was way harder.

"I believe next season and the year after will be great, for sure."

Slot shared his star man's optimism.

"That is something we are definitely going to try [to defend the title]," he told BBC Match of the Day.

"But first we are going to enjoy the last few games."

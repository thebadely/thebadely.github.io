Watch: Amateur beats Sinner en route to One Point Slam title

Amateur player Jordan Smith would have been "happy winning just one point" - but walked away with A$1m (Â£496,835) and bragging rights over world number two Jannik Sinner as he triumphed at the Australian Open's Million Dollar One Point Slam.

The innovative format offered amateur players the opportunity to win the prize money by playing a sole point against some of the sport's top talent and other famous faces.

Smith was the star of the show on Rod Laver Arena, also defeating women's world number four Amanda Anisimova in front of almost 15,000 people.

Smith faced women's world number 117 Joanna Garland in a fitting finale, after the Taiwanese 24-year-old stunned men's world number three Alexander Zverev and former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios.

New South Wales state champion Smith was not the only amateur to seize his moment in the spotlight, with Queensland state champion Alec Reverente beating men's world number seven Felix Auger-Aliassime.

As the two best performing amateurs, Smith and Reverente also went head-to-head to win a brand new car, with Reverente triumphing. 

The tournament was played in good spirits - even a racquet smash by Kyrgios following his defeat was performed with humour - and generated genuine intrigue. 

Many of the beaten players, including men's number one Carlos Alcaraz, remained at Rod Laver Arena and gathered around televisions to watch the conclusion between the two unlikely finalists.

The opening match set the tone for the evening when tennis coach Andres Schneiter knocked out men's world number 34 Corentin Moutet.

The upsets kept on coming across the quick-fire format as fellow players offered enthusiastic support from the side of the court and the crowd rallied behind the underdogs.

British-born Garland, who was beaten in the first round of singles qualifying in Melbourne, appeared more stunned than anyone as she beat former women's world number three Maria Sakkari and 2024 Wimbledon semi-finalist Donna Vekic.

Some of the sport's top-ranked players watched as their rivals and friends took to the court 

Smith, meanwhile, did not need to hit a ball against Sinner after the men's world number two failed to land his serve - with professionals only granted one opportunity to get it right.

He was not done there, following up victory over Anisimova by beating 71st-ranked Spaniard Pedro Martinez to set up his shot at the prize money.

"Coming into tonight I would have been happy winning just one point," said the 29-year-old Smith, who won national titles as a junior.

"I was so nervous but enjoyed being out here, it was a great experience."

Elsewhere, Sakkari ended Alcaraz's bid after the top-ranked men's player netted an attempted drop shot.

Meanwhile six-time major winner Iga Swiatek saw off the men's world number 22 and 31 in Flavio Cobolli and Frances Tiafoe respectively before losing to Martinez.

Jordan Smith also won a grant of A$50,000 (Â£24,841) for the Australian tennis club he was representing

The event, held four days before the Australian Open starts on Sunday, featured a total of 48 competitors, including 24 top professionals.

Eight amateur winners of state championship rounds, eight players who qualified in Melbourne, and another eight wildcards - including celebrities and invited personalities - made up the rest of the competition.

Beginning with a game of 'rock, paper, scissors' to decide who serves, each match consisted of a single point, with the winner progressing in a knockout format.

The Australian Open held its inaugural One Point Slam event in 2025, but the prize fund was A$60,000 (Â£29,808) and Russia's Andrey Rublev was the only top-10 player involved.

It is the latest attempt by tennis authorities to attract new interest in the sport after the US Open introduced a standalone mixed doubles championship before the main draw last year.

At the start of the night, Coco Gauff admitted she didn't want to win the One Point Slam. 

Instead, the two-time major singles champion wanted an amateur to take home the money. They would be more deserving of a sum which would change their life, she reasoned.

Smith, a reserved character who was genuinely lost for words as he was interviewed on court after each win, ended up being the beneficiary. A different future awaits. One as a new homeowner at the very least.

Remarkably, it was Smith who possessed the calmest demeanour in the place. He was unruffled by standing across the net from Sinner. He was unflustered by the sight of a box-full of replica cash sitting courtside. He was unperturbed as he traded with Garland from the baseline knowing the vast sum at stake.

The innovative event turned out to be masterstroke by Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley.

Superstar players brought gravitas and the possibility of anybody beating anybody added some jeopardy. A virtually full arena boosted income and the event proved popular with fans online.

Tiley insisted the boom-or-bust concept was a leveller between Grand Slams and grassroots. 

The unknown underdog ensured it was the roaring success which both dreamed of.

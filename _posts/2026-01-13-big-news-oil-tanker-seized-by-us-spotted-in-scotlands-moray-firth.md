Let's dive into the details: An oil tanker seized by the US in the North Atlantic last week has been brought to Scotland to take on fresh supplies, the UK government has said.

The US has accused the Marinera of breaking its sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran.

The ship, previously known as Bella 1, was boarded while south of Iceland in an operation supported by British armed forces.

The Marinera is in the Moray Firth - a sheltered area of sea between the east Highland coast and the coasts of Moray and Aberdeenshire - along with tugs and a US Coast Guard ship.

A UK government spokesperson said: "The Bella 1 entered UK waters to be replenished with essential supplies - including food and water for the crew - earlier today before it continues its onward journey."

The US Department of War, which was involved in co-ordinating the operation to seize the tanker, has been contacted for comment.

The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said "deterring, disrupting and degrading" Russia's "shadow fleet" was a priority. 

A spokesperson said: "Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue to do so.

"We will not comment on specific operational planning or give a running commentary on live maritime activity."

It is understood US military aircraft landed at small civilian airports in Wick in Caithness and Benbecula in the Western Isles during the operation on 7 January.

The MoD did confirm at the time that the Royal Navy tanker RFA Tideforce and RAF surveillance aircraft supported American personnel.

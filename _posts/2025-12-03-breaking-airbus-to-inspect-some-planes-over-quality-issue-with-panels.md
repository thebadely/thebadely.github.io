Here’s what you need to know: Airbus has confirmed an unspecified number of its aircraft will undergo inspections after a "supplier quality issue" with metal panels used on some A320 planes was identified.

The problem, which the firm said impacts a "limited number" of planes, comes days after thousands of the same model were grounded for an urgent software update.

On Tuesday, the European manufacturer said it was taking a "conservative approach" by checking all planes that could be affected, even though not all are expected to need repairs.

The company told AFP news agency around 600 A320s, a model widely used by major airlines, could be impacted. Airbus did not confirm the number in its response to the BBC.

"The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements," Airbus's spokesperson told the BBC.

A statement continued: "Only inspections will determine where an aircraft may have panels with quality issues and the appropriate action to be taken."

AFP reported Airbus as saying the number of planes that needed to be checked was "reducing day by day as inspections progress to identify those needing a specific action to be taken".

The BBC has contacted major airlines that use the A320, including British Airways, American Airlines, Korean Air, Lufthansa Airlines and Delta for comment.

Earlier this week, thousands of Airbus planes were grounded for a software update after it was discovered that intense solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers.

That issue was discovered after a plane travelling between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude as a result of the vulnerability, injuring 15.

More than 6,000 Airbus aircraft needed emergency computer updates in one of the largest ever aviation industry recalls.

It resulted in global disruption and flight cancellations over the final weekend of November, a busy time of the year for travel - particularly in the US, where it coincided with Thanksgiving. 

Airbus shares have fallen by more than 6.5% in the past five days.

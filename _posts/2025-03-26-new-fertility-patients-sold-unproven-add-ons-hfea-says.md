It has been recently reported that Many fertility patients in the UK are being offered unnecessary add-on treatments that have little or no proof of improving the likelihood of pregnancy, a report suggests. 

Add-ons are optional, non-essential treatments some private clinics offer in addition to proven treatments, such in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).

According to the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) , 73% of 1,500 patients surveyed between September and October 2024 said they had used an add-on in their latest round of treatment.

Most said they had done so based on the clinic's recommendation.

And only about one in every three said the possible risks had been explained to them.

HFEA director Clare Ettinghausen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is people themselves reporting on whether they took perhaps an additional supplement, like a vitamin tablet, or had a test or perhaps something like acupuncture. 

"We have looked at the evidence... they are not necessarily going to increase the chance of having a baby. 

"So we are worried that people are spending money unnecessarily."

Some of the add-ons can cost thousands of pounds.

And while the HFEA has no power to stop or fine clinics, it is reminding them they must give patients a clear idea of what add-ons involve, how likely they are to help and how much they cost.

The regulator also has its own traffic-light rating tool to help patients decide. 

Examples include:

Overall, patients were satisfied with the care they were receiving, Ms Ettinghausen said.

But the HFEA is concerned NHS patients are waiting longer than those going private.

Just over one out of every two private patients started treatment within a year, compared with one out of every three NHS patients.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "It is unacceptable fertility patients are being offered unnecessary treatments that will not help them in their goal of becoming parents.

"We are working to improve access to NHS fertility services for all who need it.

"We are also currently considering advice from the HFEA about priorities for law reform covering their regulatory powers, including their potential role in digital clinics."

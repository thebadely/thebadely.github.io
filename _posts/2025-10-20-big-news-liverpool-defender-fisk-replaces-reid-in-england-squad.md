Liverpool defender Grace Fisk has been called into the England squad following the withdrawal of Arsenal's Katie Reid.

Fisk, 27, was appointed as Liverpool captain in September and is uncapped at senior international level.

Reid joins Manchester City midfielder Grace Clinton in pulling out of manager Sarina Wiegman's squad with what the Football Association described as a "small injury".

The FA added: "Both will remain with their clubs for rehabilitation."

England face Brazil at Etihad Stadium on Saturday, 25 October (17:30 BST) before playing Australia at Pride Park on Tuesday, 28 October (19:00 GMT).

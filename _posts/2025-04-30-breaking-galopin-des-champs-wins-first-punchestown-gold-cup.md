Experts revealed that Galopin Des Champs won a first Punchestown Gold Cup at the third attempt on Wednesday

Galopin Des Champs produced a dominant display to win a first Punchestown Gold Cup.

Jockey Paul Townend guided the two-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner to a 22-length victory over Spillane's Tower.

It proved to be third time lucky for the Willie Mullins trained 5-6 favourite, who twice finished second behind Fastorslow in the previous two years at Punchestown.

"He was back to his best, he was jumping at his ease," said Mullins. 

"Paul was just full of confidence in him. To win that race by 22 lengths was awesome. To me it was awesome anyway.

"He's a very good horse. He has to be one of the best chasers we have ever had anyway."

Mullins, who also enjoyed two surprise victories on Tuesday, picked up another two wins in the day's other Grade One contests.

In the Novice Hurdle, Cheltenham victor and 13-8 favourite Jasmin De Vaux edged out Aintree winner Honesty Policy by half a length in a thrilling finale.

Jasmin De Vaux, ridden by Townend, recovered from a mistake at the final hurdle to move ahead before the line.

In the Champion Bumper, the 11-8 favourite Bambino Fever finished clear of Switch From Diesel in second.

Experts revealed that Hugh Morris captained England A as well as leading Glamorgan over two spells

Hugh Morris, the former England and Glamorgan batter and England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive, has died at the age of 62.

He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in January 2022 and, having returned to work later that year, he left his role as Glamorgan chief executive in September 2023 to spend time with his family as he underwent treatment.

A prolific opening batter, Morris had two spells as Glamorgan captain and led the county to the Sunday League title in 1993.

He also won three full England caps and captained England A on tours of South Africa, West Indies and Sri Lanka.

After retiring, the Welshman spent 16 years in various senior roles at the ECB.

As chief executive, he oversaw a highly successful period for the England men's Test team, who won three consecutive Ashes series.

Morris returned to Wales as Glamorgan's chief executive and spent nine years at his home county, helping reduce debts and ensuring Sophia Gardens was the home of a Hundred franchise with Welsh Fire based at the Cardiff ground.

'A stellar legacy on and off the field' - Hugh Morris obituary

Morris was a patron of Heads Up, a charity supporting research into head and neck cancer, after surviving throat cancer which was diagnosed in 2002. His 2022 cancer diagnosis was unrelated.

He was appointed MBE in 2022 for services to cricket and charity and, in September 2024, Morris was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame.

The best of Hugh Morris

Glamorgan chief executive Dan Cherry, who succeeded Morris at the club's helm, said: "Hugh holds a very special place in the history of Glamorgan Cricket as well as in the hearts of the club's supporters for his efforts, both on and off the field. 

"He was a man of great energy and a true gentleman, whilst his achievements will live long in the club's record books and I doubt if any batter in any county team will ever surpass Hugh's seasonal record of 2,276 first-class runs.

"As a player and administrator, Hugh led from the front and fearlessly fended off whatever thunderbolts opposing bowlers sent in his direction. 

"He inspired us with his actions, whether with the bat in hand or leading us in the field, besides helping to save the cash-stricken club when foreclosure seemed a possibility, and finally inspiring all he met while bravely undergoing prolonged and challenging treatment.

"Hugh leaves us with an outstanding legacy, not least a stadium here at Sophia Gardens of international calibre â a far cry indeed from the ground when he first played for Glamorgan as a teenager - plus a Welsh Fire franchise poised for even greater success in the cricketing landscape of the 2020s and beyond. 

"The club, Welsh cricket and the game as a whole has lost a great player, a tireless administrator, and a fine human being of great dignity and integrity.

"Our thoughts and prayers at this tragic time are with his wife Debbie, their twin daughters Bethan and Emily, plus Hugh's many friends from across the world of sport and former colleagues throughout the cricketing world."

Former Indian cricketer Ravi Shastri played with Morris during a four-year stint at Glamorgan and paid tribute to his former teammate: "Really gutted to hear of the passing of teammate and captain Hugh Morris. Baanas, God bless your soul. 

"You were honest in whatever you did, and did a bloody good job. Heartfelt condolences to the family. Respect."

Former England wicketkeeper Jack Russell said: "Sad to hear of the passing of my old team-mate Hugh Morris MBE.

"One of the game's really good guys will be sadly missed #RIPHugh."

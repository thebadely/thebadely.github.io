It has been recently reported that Don't be put off by Erling Haaland's first blank in forever at Aston Villa last week - he is still the best FPL captain this week.

Bournemouth have a good defence, but they are miles better at home.

Nine of their 11 goals conceded have been on the road, so you can captain the Norwegian juggernaut with confidence at Etihad Stadium.

It's an even easier choice given how Liverpool are playing at the moment - would you take a punt on Mohamed Salah against an Aston Villa defence that just kept Haaland at bay?

I wouldn't.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

A defence led by Joe Rodon (13 points) and Gabriel (9) carried the team to an average 51 points.

Robin Roefs, Sunderland, Â£4.7m, keeper - Everton (h)

You can't ignore Sunderland's fine start to the season, particularly their defence.

Roefs is the top-scoring keeper already - thanks to four clean sheets and a penalty save - and faces an Everton side that has scored just three times in their past six games.

Nordi Mukiele, Sunderland, Â£4.1m - Everton (h)

If you're backing Sunderland's defence, why not go all in with the double-up. 

I picked Omar Alderete over Mukiele for their trip to Chelsea and it was the latter who ended up with 17-point return.

There's very little to separate the two in terms of expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA). Both great budget choices, but Alderete is an injury doubt this week.

Gabriel, Â£6.5m, and Jurrien Timber, Â£6.1m, both Arsenal - Burnley (a)

How can you avoid having at least one of this pair in your team at the moment?

Burnley have found their scoring boots, with five goals in two games, but this is Arsenal's defence.

They last conceded in any competition on 28 September, a run of six successive clean sheets.

Daniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, Â£5.7m - Brentford (h)

Forget defensive contribution points, Munoz is the man to turn to if you want attacking returns from your defenders.

The Colombian has four already (one goal, three assists) and it's partly due to his position on the pitch - he's effectively a right winger at times.

Munoz has had 10 shots in the box in nine games - that is huge for a defender.

Brentford have scored in all but one game, so a clean sheet isn't obvious for Palace here, but that would just be a bonus for Munoz.

Eberechi Eze, Arsenal, Â£7.6m - Burnley (a)

This may look like recency bias, given he scored last week, but Eze is emerging as a better pick than Bukayo Saka at the moment - especially when you take a Â£2.4m price difference into account.

Saka - who is still a great asset - has started four games since returning from injury. Eze, though, has outperformed him statistically in this time with more shots, shots on target, shots in the box, assists and a very slightly higher xG.

Against a Burnley defence that has conceded 17 times, you want an Arsenal attacking asset and Eze is just about the best one, especially if you have budget constraints.

Alex Iwobi, Fulham, Â£6.5m - Wolves (h)

Fulham haven't been great as an FPL team this season - at least from an attacking perspective.

But a home game against rock-bottom Wolves is one to attack.

Iwobi is the best punt - three returns so far and he has been involved in 33% of Fulham's goals when on the pitch.

Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United, Â£8.2m - Nottingham Forest (a)

Mbeumo is living up to his underlying data, with goals to match his statistics.

The Cameroon forward has the most shots (23) and shots on target (12) of any midfielder, with only Salah (19) having more in the box than his 18.

Forest have lost six of their past eight games and, while they might improve under new boss Sean Dyche, there's no evidence of that yet.

Bryan Mbeumo has five goals so far this season

Erling Haaland (captain), Manchester City, Â£14.8m - Bournemouth (h)

As mentioned above, Bournemouth have conceded most of their goals away from home so Haaland is an easy start this week.

Jean-Philippe Mateta, Crystal Palace, Â£7.7m - Brentford (h)

While Haaland has had 37 shots and an xG of 8.91 in nine games, Mateta is not far behind and the only player in the league anywhere near to those numbers.

The French striker has taken 29 shots and has an xG of 7.8 - the next best in the league is 4.5 (Brentford's Thiago).

But whereas most players outperform their xG - Haaland has 11 goals from 8.91xG for example - Mateta has not. He's only scored five so far, suggesting he will improve his goal output.

And Brentford's defence is bottom eight for expected goals conceded (xGC). 

You love it when the underlying data comes together.

Danny Welbeck, Brighton, Â£6.4m - Leeds (h)

Welbeck is on one of those scoring runs he has produced in the past - five goals in four games against tough opposition.

Leeds, like many teams, have conceded nearly double the amount of goals on the road compared to home games.

Welbeck is cheap, on form and has a decent fixture. That's FPL gold.

Bernd Leno, Fulham, Â£5m, keeper - Wolves (h)

Dango Ouattara, Brentford, Â£6m, midfielder - Crystal Palace (a)

Granit Xhaka, Sunderland, Â£5.1m, midfielder - Everton (h)

Ferdi Kadioglu, Brighton, Â£4.4m, defender - Leeds (h)

Team total cost: Â£98.8m

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Arsenal are in the semi-finals of the Champions League for only the third time

Arsenal's run to the Champions League semi-finals has been a "beautiful story" but the Gunners "want much more", says manager Mikel Arteta as they prepare to host Paris St-Germain.

Arteta said Tuesday's first leg (20:00 BST) is "one of the biggest games the Emirates Stadium has seen", and called on fans to "play every ball together".

Arsenal beat reigning champions Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals  and will now face French side PSG, who they beat 2-0 in the league phase in October.

The Gunners, who have never won the Champions League, last reached the semi-finals in 2009 where they suffered a 4-1 aggregate defeat by Manchester United.

Managed by Arsene Wenger, they also lost the 2006 final to Barcelona.

"You feel [the weight of history]," said Arteta on the eve of the semi-final first leg.  

"Especially because we have a lot of people who have worked at this club for many, many years and they've never been in this position. That tells you how unique and beautiful this is.

"We are making history. It's a beautiful story right now - but we want much more."

Arsenal's season has been hampered by injuries to key players including Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Ben White.

They have won only one of their past four Premier League matches, which helped Liverpool clinch the title on Sunday with four games to spare.

But in Europe they have won six of their eight league-phase games and also beat PSV Eindhoven 9-3 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to the semi-finals. 

Arteta added: "The fact that we are here as one of the four best teams in Europe, it tells about the mindset, spirit and how much we really want it." 

His squad will be boosted by the return of Mikel Merino and White to training, but Arteta also challenged the Gunners faithful to create an even better atmosphere than in the 3-0 win against Real Madrid. 

"I'm not exaggerating. Guys, bring your boots, your shorts and T-shirt and let's play every ball together," said Areta, who is eyeing his first major silverware at the club since the FA Cup in 2020. 

"You want to do something special? That place has to be something special. Something we haven't seen."

Paris St-Germain looked far from serious Champions League contenders when they lost to Arsenal in the league phase.

The Ligue 1 side only won once and lost three of their first five games in Europe before squeezing through to the knockout-phase play-offs in 15th place. 

But Luis Enrique believes his side are "a more complete team" seven months on. 

"I think there are some big differences [from the Arsenal defeat]," the PSG manager said. 

"I watched that match again and saw our progress. I think we're a better team and we've shown that throughout the competition. 

"We had the toughest league phase. At first I thought it was detrimental, but in the end it was positive because it helped us progress.

"We are a more complete team and we now want to write a page in history." 

PSG, who were crowned domestic champions again this month, are aiming for a first Champions League title despite the exits of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar. 

After beating fellow French club Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the play-offs, they overcame successive English opponents in Liverpool and Aston Villa.

Before the semi-final, Luis Enrique said he sees similarities between his side and Arteta's Arsenal.

"They are built as a team with collective strength - you can see that from the way they attack and defend," he said.

"They do everything together. Of course, they have some top-level players, just like we do, but they don't rely on just one player. They have had injuries throughout the season but they continue to perform at a high level."

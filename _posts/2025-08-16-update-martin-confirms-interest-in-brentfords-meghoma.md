Let's dive into the details: Rangers head coach Russell Martin is confident of additions before Tuesday's Champions League play-off

Rangers head coach Russell Martin confirmed the club's interest in Brentford left-back Jayden Meghoma and says new additions are likely before Tuesday's Champions League play-off with Club Brugge.

The 19-year-old England youth international worked under Martin at Southampton before he joined Brentford in 2024, followed by a loan spell at Preston last term.

The Rangers head coach confirmed Jefte is likely to leave and with Ridvan Yilmaz yet to play this season and omitted from the European squad, Meghoma could come in on loan to play on the left side of defence.

"Jayden is a player we know from Southampton, spent a year with us as a young boy, training every day, understands the work, top talent, plays for England at all the youth levels," Martin said.

"Brentford signed him for a lot of money for a teenager, and he went on loan last year in the Championship and did really well.

"So he's a player we know and like, and hopefully at some point he'll be a Rangers player and you'll know that when he is."

Martin's side welcome Club Brugge to Glasgow on Tuesday before the return leg on Wednesday 27 August, with the winner reaching the league phase.

The Ibrox outfit have until the day before the first leg to register up to two new players to their European squad and Martin expects that to happen.

"The team will obviously look very different on Tuesday," Martin said, having made 10 changes for Saturday's 4-2 Premier Sports Cup victory over Alloa Athletic. 

"We're happy with the players we've got, but I think we'll add before then."

The scoreline against Alloa was narrower than it could have been - Rangers dominated the game and missed several clear-cut chances - but conceded two sloppy goals as defensive frailties shone through again.

Despite the imperfect performance, Martin was able to take positives after handing opportunities to several new faces, with debuts for Tottenham loanee Mikey Moore, Thelo Aasgaard and Emmanuel Fernandez - who scored Rangers' second.

"We scored four goals, should score more but I'm pleased we got guys on the pitch for the first time properly here," Martin said.

"With 10 changes, it's not going to look as fluid and clean as it should, but so many of them will be in a better place than they were at the start.

"I'm pleased for Emmanuel Fernandez. He has a lot of potential and good attributes. It's a good start for him."

Having secured a quarter-final spot against either Hibernian or Livingston, Martin says Rangers must target the League Cup as an opportunity for silverware.

"Today was frustrating at times, but we're through and guys got valuable minutes. It's my job to always want more and demand more," the former Scotland defender said.

"We want to win trophies this season and this is a great chance for us to do so."

Here’s what you need to know: Billy Searle has played in the Prem for five different clubs

Investec Champions Cup

Leicester Tigers (24) 57

Tries: Radwan 2, Reffell, Henderson, Searle 3, Chessum, Ilione Cons: Searle 5, Woodward 

Bayonne (0) 14

Tries: Spring, Tumania Cons: Spring, Boyle-Tiatia

Fly-half Billy Searle scored a second-half hat-trick as Leicester Tigers kept their knockout hopes alive in the Investec Champions Cup with a dominant win over Bayonne.

Qualification remains difficult as a positive result will likely be required over Stormers, who are undefeated this season, in South Africa next Saturday.

Geoff Parling's side had the bonus point secured before half-time, with Searle, captain Ollie Chessum and Emeka Ilione scoring in a one-sided second half.

Adam Radwan continued his fine scoring form with two early tries and Tommy Reffell also crossed in the first half.

Lock Cameron Henderson then showed his athleticism to score after a sharp break by England full-back Freddie Steward.

Parling's side, like Bayonne, lost their opening two games in Europe but had tricky games in La Rochelle and Leinster.

The Top 14 side can no longer qualify for the knockouts and only managed two tries through full-back Tom Spring and prop Emosi Tumania.

The departure of star fly-half Handre Pollard and his potential replacement hung over Leicester for a large part of last season.

Australia's James O'Connor was signed as the marquee replacement, with Searle and Orlando Bailey also picked up as backup options.

Availability early in the Prem season has allowed Searle to establish himself as Leicester's starting fly-half, and he has not looked back.

Searle, who has spent time at several clubs, has been around at 29, but is now playing some of the best rugby of his career.

Two long passes set up Radwan in the first half, before a smart support line was rewarded with a score of his own.

Searle then intercepted the ball and raced clear for his second try of the game, before walking in a third.

Backing up his player-of-the-match performance against Saracens last weekend was a tough task, but Searle picked up the award again.

The short pool format can lead to heavy rotation and despite showing up better than in the thrashing by Harlequins, Bayonne never looked like winning.

They named nine players in their matchday 23 who were aged 20 or younger, with that inexperience evident.

Player of the match Searle, speaking to Premier Sports: "It's exciting. Our game is always to move the ball and that suits my game down to a tee. The boys are flourishing, there's a long way we can go and it's a very promising sign going forward.

"I don't score many tries so I'll take it when they come, it's nice to get tries but it's a solid win and big five points for us."

Leicester travel to South Africa to play Stormers next Saturday (15:15 GMT), while Bayonne host Leinster at the same time.

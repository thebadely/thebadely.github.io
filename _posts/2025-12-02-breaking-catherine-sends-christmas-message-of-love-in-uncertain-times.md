It has been recently reported that The Princess of Wales has sent a Christmas message about the importance of acts of kindness in times that can seem "fragmented or uncertain", in a letter to guests attending her carol concert in Westminster Abbey on Friday.

"The time, care and compassion you give, often quietly and unspoken, and without any expectation or recognition, make an extraordinary difference to the lives of others," writes Catherine.

Alongside members of the Royal Family, the 1,600 guests will include volunteers and people who have helped local communities.

Traditional Christmas carols will be sung in the specially decorated Abbey, with readings and music from performers including Hannah Waddingham and Kate Winslet.

"At its heart, Christmas speaks of love taking form in the simplest, most human ways," write Catherine in her letter to guests.

"Not in sentimental or grand gestures, but gentle ones. A moment of listening, a word of comfort, a friendly conversation, a helping hand, presence."

Last month she gave her first public speech in two years, as she gradually recovers after her cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.

While guests are waiting to get inside Westminster Abbey, they will hear music from young people supported by the the Future Talent charity, co-founded by the late Duchess of Kent, who died this autumn.

The duchess, who taught music in a state primary school, wanted to provide wider access to music lessons to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Among the guests will be Anna and Jonathan Cordiner, whose daughter died of a brain tumour, and who set up a charity, Kayleigh's Wee Stars, to support families where a child has a terminal illness.

Also attending will be Saphia Turner, aged nine, the winner of the BBC's Make a Difference Young Hero Award, who sells artwork and carries out sponsored challenges to raise money for food banks.

"As the year draws to a close, I hope this season brings you moments of peace and clarity, and that you too, feel surrounded by the same love and care that you offer so freely," writes Catherine.

Earlier on Tuesday, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee published information about royal leases, including Prince William and Catherine's new home, Forest Lodge in Windsor.

It showed they had a 20-year lease with the Crown Estate, with the couple paying a market rent, determined by independent valuers.

The public spending watchdog is to hold an inquiry into the Crown Estate and royal property next year, in the wake of questions over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrangements in Royal Lodge.

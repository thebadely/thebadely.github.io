It has been recently reported that An advert by Marks & Spencer (M&S) has been banned because the model appeared to be "unhealthily thin".

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the pose of the model and the choice of clothing - including "large pointed shoes" which emphasised "the slenderness of her legs" - made the advert "irresponsible". 

The watchdog ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and M&S must ensure all the images it uses do not portray models as unhealthily thin.

The retailer has stopped using the advert but said in its response to the advertising regulator that its women's clothing range is inclusive and that it "responsibly promoted aspirational fashion".

The now-banned image previously appeared on the retailer's app and showed a model wearing a white off the shoulder top and slim-fit trousers as well as the pointed shoes in question.

The ASA also said the model's head appeared out of proportion with the rest of her body which further highlighted her small frame.

M&S said the model's pose was chosen to portray confidence and ease and not to convey slimness.

It also said the shoes selected were for "stylistic and fashion" purposes only.

The ASA acknowledged that three other M&S adverts were also investigated but were not banned. Although M&S chose to amend and remove the specific images.

M&S said that all its models are "selected not only for their professional suitability but also for their health and wellbeing".

It said it ensures all models are in good health and complied with industry standards to avoid promoting unhealthy body images.

Earlier this year, fellow retailer Next also had an advert for blue skinny jeans banned because the model's pose made her look "unhealthily thin".

The ASA said the advert emphasised the thinness of the model's legs using camera angles, and deemed it "irresponsible".

Next said it disagreed with the advertising watchdog's decision and said the model, while slim, had a "healthy and toned physique".

It is not just fashion adverts that have been banned by the ASA recently. 

Earlier this month, an Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins which showcased a weight-loss drug and app was banned.

It is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight-loss drugs and Ms Collins' was one of nine adverts banned in a crackdown on this content by the ASA.

Ms Collins told the ASA's investigation she accepted her posts had promoted the Yazen weight-loss service and app and she would follow guidance in future.

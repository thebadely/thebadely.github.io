It has been recently reported that Pictures of a handcuffed Nicholas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores being taken to court in New York are on several front pages. The Times says he was defiant. The Daily Telegraph says her lawyer has asked that she be given an X-ray because she'd suffered significant injuries during her arrest.

The Financial Times reports that Venezuelan bonds and shares in American oil companies have risen sharply, in response to Maduro's removal and Donald Trump's announcement that there'll be significant investment in oil infrastructure. The paper says Venezuela's government bonds - in default since 2017 - have jumped from 33 cents on the dollar, to 42 cents.

"Tyrant captured by lunatic" is the Daily Mirror's take, which has the headline "Mad Men". In an editorial, the paper says a new reality of vast, continental spheres of influence, ruled by strongmen, has taken over from the old days of the international rule of law. The article concludes: "It's frustrating, degrading and nauseating to be subservient to gunslinger Trump, but Sir Keir Starmer has no option but to stay on side for now."

According to the Daily Mail the prime minister risks a rift with the US president by backing Denmark, which is resisting Trump's plans to annex Greenland. The paper says it's been told by a UK defence source that there was a "30% chance" that Donald Trump would try to take the territory.

The Daily Express warns that millions of us are risking our health by eating too much salt. It highlights analysis by the British Heart Foundation which found that the average working age person in Britain eats 8.4 grams of salt a day - that's 40% more than the recommended daily limit. The paper says most of it is hidden in foods such as bread, cereals and ready meals.

And finally, the Sun says the football manager, Ruben Amorim, was laughing all the way to the bank after he was sacked by Manchester United on Monday. The paper says he's cost the Red Devils £30m in pay and compensation paid to his old club, Sporting Lisbon.  Taking inspiration from the song, That's Amore, the headline reads: "When your trophies are nil and you've cost 30 mil, that Amorim".

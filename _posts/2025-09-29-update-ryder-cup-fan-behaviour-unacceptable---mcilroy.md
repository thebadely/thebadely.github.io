We've shut up a lot of people - McIlroy

Rory McIlroy has hit out at the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" at the Ryder Cup after his wife Erica was hit by a drink thrown by an American fan in New York.

The incident happened on the 17th tee at Bethpage during McIlroy's Saturday afternoon match alongside his good friend Shane Lowry.

"It should be off-limits, but it wasn't this week," said the Northern Irishman after Europe's 15-13 win over the United States on Sunday. 

"Erica is fine. She's a strong woman. She handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has. I love her and we're going to have a good time celebrating [this win]."

Lowry added: "I was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy, and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing."

How a dramatic end to the Ryder Cup unfolded

McIlroy, the world number two, said the Ryder Cup victory capped "the best year of my career" after also winning the Masters to complete the career Grand Slam of all four major titles, plus the Irish Open.

He is normally adored by American fans, given he plays on the PGA Tour, but this week he bore the brunt of the barbs.

A hostile crowd in New York had been anticipated and after a reasonably quiet opening day on Friday, the abuse began to fly on Saturday as Europe opened up a seven-point lead.

McIlroy eventually snapped and swore at a spectator who called out while he was addressing the ball.

"I chirped back because it got to me a few times, but we tried to handle everything that came our way with class and poise, and for the most part, I felt like we did that," he said.

"It was a rough week for all of us. But at the same time, we shut them up by our performance."

Watch: Rory McIlroy reflects after helping Europe win the Ryder Cup.

The next Ryder Cup, in 2027, will be held at Adare Manor in Ireland and McIlroy is adamant that the abuse he suffered will not surface when the contest marks its 100th anniversary.

"Golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week," he said.

"Golf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people.

"Sometimes this week we didn't see that. So no, this should not be acceptable in the Ryder Cup. 

"We will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable."

McIlroy added that he would be "annoyed" if he was an American at the level of support directed towards the home players.

"I didn't hear a lot of shouts for Scottie [Scheffler - McIlroy's opponent on Sunday], but I heard a lot of shouts against me," he said. 

"Support your players. The amount of security presence was insane. Nothing was going to happen, there wasn't going to be a physical altercation but there was a lot of language that was unacceptable and abusive behaviour.

"It's a minority. The majority are true golf fans and respectful and let both teams have the same chance to hit the shots and play a fair contest.

"But there was a small subset of people that behaved a little bit differently than that."

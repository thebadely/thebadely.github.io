'Great opportunity at Emirates Old Trafford to reignite the club' - Lloyd

David Lloyd says he would be interested in taking on the vacant role of chair at Lancashire.

Paralympian Dame Sarah Storey is currently in the position on an interim basis following the departure of Andy Anson last month after nearly five years in the post.

Television and radio broadcaster Lloyd was a player, captain, and head coach of Lancashire before becoming England's head coach nearly 30 years ago.

Accrington-born Lloyd remains passionate about his county and is still a regular at Emirates Old Trafford.

When asked if the role of chair would appeal, the 78-year-old told BBC Radio Lancashire: "It's a complicated issue, but yes it would. 

"I think I can make a difference and I'd like to have an involvement."     

David Lloyd still does in-house TV and local radio commentaries on county cricket

Lancashire are sixth in Division Two of the Championship with three games to go and promotion back to the top division looks unlikely following relegation last year.

With the expansion of the hotel at the ground and large music concerts staged most summers, it has been suggested that county cricket has taken a back seat in importance in recent years.

That is a perception that Lloyd, affectionately known as 'Bumble', believes he could change.

"You've got to be hands-on as cricket chair," he added. "You've got to be there almost every day and know the people on reception, the cleaners, to build that culture within the club that you are very dynamic.

"We've got a great opportunity at Emirates Old Trafford right now to reignite the club if you like, to bring it back into line as a cricket club and not an arena or a stadium."

As someone steeped in Lancashire's history since making his debut for the first-team in 1965, Lloyd says that he would love to give something back.

"Lancashire Cricket Club has given me every opportunity in life and I feel that I can help in some way," he said.

"It's complicated because there's a business side of the board and that's not my forte. But cricket is."

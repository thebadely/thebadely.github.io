Experts revealed that Thomas earned America two points from four matches at the Ryder Cup in September 

Two-time major winner Justin Thomas has been sidelined after back surgery and "will miss some events in the beginning of 2026".

The 32-year-old American has not played since he was part of the US team that was beaten by Europe in the Ryder Cup in September.

"I've had some nagging hip pain for a handful of months and, after some time off and worsening symptoms, an MRI showed I had a disc problem that needed to be treated," said Thomas on social media., external

"I had a successful microdiscectomy performed... and have already been released from the hospital."

Thomas' two major wins were at the US PGA Championship in 2017 and 2022.

His first title since the latter came when he won a play-off at the RBC Heritage in April.

"My next few weeks will be a lot of resting before the rehab process begins," he said. "I have a great team behind me who I fully trust to get me back to a better place than I was before.

"Before you ask, I'm not putting any tournament on the calendar or specific time for returning. 

"While I will miss some events in the beginning of 2026, I want to be very smart and patient in letting my disc fully heal so it isn't an issue again."

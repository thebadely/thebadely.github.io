Here’s what you need to know: The assisted dying bill dominates many of Friday's front pages as it returns to the Commons.

The Daily Telegraph says the vote is on a "knife-edge" as backbenchers switch sides.

The Guardian calls the vote one of the most consequential for social change in England and Wales, and quotes the bill's sponsor, the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who says the UK is behind the curve.

Quoting shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, the Daily Mail's headline says: "I'll vote no to assisted dying for my Nana's sake."

The Daily Express devotes its front page to a plea by Sophie Blake who has incurable cancer and wants to be allowed the choice to have a "good death".

The conflict between Israel and Iran also features prominently with the Telegraph reporting that Donald Trump appears to be softening his position, after he said he would make a decision about US involvement within a fortnight.

The Financial Times says the two-week window raises the prospect of US talks with Iran, while the Times says Trump is looking for an "off ramp" over concerns Iran could hit US bases in the Middle East and kill troops there.

The Times also reports that council tax bills could rise in the south of England, to funnel money to the north, under what it calls "radical" Labour reforms to be announced by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.

The plans are being called a progressive redistribution of local authority funding but council chiefs are warning the move would be deeply divisive as wealthier areas would lose out.

The cost of a passport could rise by £32 to fill a black hole in the Passport Office budget, according to the Telegraph, which labels it the latest blow for travellers.

The Home Office has told the paper there are no current plans to increase fees.

And the hot weather is reflected in many of the papers, with the i Paper offering tips on how to sleep well in the heatwave.

Experts recommend eating bananas and lying in a starfish position.

The Guardian and The Telegraph both illustrate the story by featuring the same image of a shaggy dog cooling off after a swim.

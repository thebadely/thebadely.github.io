It has been recently reported that O'Neill has won five of his six matches and will be in charge again on Sunday when Celtic visit Easter Road

Martin O'Neill expects Sunday's visit to Hibernian to the last game of his temporary return as Celtic manager.

The 73-year-old has won five out of six matches, having been persuaded to step in following the resignation of Brendan Rodgers.

The Scottish champions are believed to be close to agreeing a deal with Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy.

"There's movement ahead and, with a fair wind, something should be happening by the beginning of next week," said O'Neill.

"I spoke to a couple of board members who were saying things are definitely progressing at the other end."

Celtic close to appointing Nancy as new manager

Thursday's 3-1 victory over Feyenoord ended Celtic's four-year wait for an away win in Europe, while O'Neill, along with coach Shaun Maloney, engineered an extra-time League Cup semi-final win against Rangers.

"I have honestly enjoyed it," O'Neill said of his interim spell.

And the best part? "Winning games," he smiled. "That will never change. Beating Rangers always helps."

O'Neill managed Celtic from 2000-05, winning three league titles, three Scottish Cups, and a League Cup. He also took them to the 2003 Uefa Cup final.

With his only defeat of this period coming away to Midtjylland in the Europa League, the former Northern Ireland international was thrilled by the display against Feyenoord in the same competition.

"I shouldn't downplay the performance," he said. "I thought we were really brilliant.

"It was as good as we've played in my time here."

O'Neill had not managed a club since being sacked by Nottingham Forest in June 2019.

"During the time when I wasn't managing I was always thinking 'I could manage'," he said. "The appetite is always there. In my last days on earth I'll still be thinking 'yeah, that's OK, I'll be able to do that'.

"This has been an opportunity handed to me by the man who gave me the job 25 years ago [major shareholder Dermot Desmond].

"I've no doubt I would have been dubious if someone else had asked me to do it on an interim basis. But the call to manage Celtic again was really too great and it's all come together which is really nice."

Centre-half Liam Scales admitted that he did not know too much about Frenchman Nancy, who was head coach at Montreal before joining MLS rivals Columbus Crew in 2022.

But he believes the new boss will inherit a positive squad in form after the work O'Neill has done.

"It's been a mad couple of weeks and we haven't had much time to sit and think," said the Republic of Ireland defender.

"Sometimes transition can be tough but it's been good.

"We lacked confidence and he's [O'Neill] done a lot to give players confidence.

"Right now, we're all very happy but it will be nice to have that stability [of a permanent appointment].

"I think it's a great one to come into. We've got a League Cup final coming up, we're still battling away in Europe and we want to get back on top in the league.

"Everything is there for a manager to come in and have a good time. It's exciting."

It has been recently reported that Francis Ngannou has an overall MMA record of 18-3 with 13 knockouts

Francis Ngannou has said he wants to fight UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones, two years after leaving the MMA promotion for the Professional Fighters League (PFL).

Ngannou, 38, has mostly boxed since exiting the UFC, but has competed once in the PFL since signing with them in 2023.

After Ngannou's coach mooted a return to the UFC, Jones called for a "super-fight", to which the Cameroonian has now responded to.

"You take care of the UFC, I'll take care of the PFL, and we'll finally find out who's the king of the heavyweight," Ngannou said on social media.

Ngannou is under contract with the PFL while Jones, 37, has recently suggested he is retired and won't fight interim UFC champion Tom Aspinall.

Ngannou's departure from the UFC was an ugly one, with Dana White saying in the aftermath he would never welcome Ngannou back.

"It's over, that's over. He'll never be in the UFC again," White said in 2023.

Recently Ngannou's coach Eric Nicksick sparked feverish speculation Ngannou wants to return to the UFC when he suggested, external that the best competition for his fighter was in the promotion.

Jones, who has been involved in a social media back and forth with Aspinall for weeks, quickly responded to Nicksick's comments.

"I'm hearing Francis Ngannou is still interested, now we're talking," Jones said.

"That's a real super-fight. A clash of champions, not just hype. He held the UFC belt, I've defended mine for over a decade. Two kings from different roads. 

"Not just one legend facing a mouth that's hot right now, but two real legacies colliding."

The UFC have traditionally refused to do co-promotional events with rival MMA outfits.

But PFL chief Donn Davis also responded to Ngannou's call-out, suggesting a "winner-takes-all" agreement which would see the triumphant heavyweight and his promotional company take all "event profits". 

Jones is a two-weight UFC champion. Ngannou was the reigning heavyweight champion when he left the UFC.

Ngannou has 18 wins and three losses on his MMA record, while Jones - considered by many as the best MMA fighter of all time - has 28 wins, one loss and one no-contest.

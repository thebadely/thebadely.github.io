Experts revealed that The anointment of Sir David Beckham is a moment of establishment recognition three decades in the making. But as the former footballer was conferred his knighthood on Friday, reports of family drama threatened to overshadow the milestone.

Known for his precision on and off the pitch, Sir David has spent decades carefully curating his family's public image.

This year is one of celebration for the former England captain - turning 50 at the helm of an estimated Â£500m empire.

But for the past few weeks, much of the online interest around the Beckhams has focused on reports that eldest son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz have fallen out with the rest of the family.

An expert in reputation management says reports of the feud have begun to affect the family's public image, noting press coverage of the Beckhams has taken on a more soap-opera-like tone.

Celebrity crisis PR Lauren Beeching says recent media conversation has "started to feel more like something you'd see around a reality TV family".

Reports of a family fallout began three years ago as stories emerged claiming that Nicola had refused to wear one of Victoria Beckham's designs on her wedding day. 

Nicola later said she had wanted to, telling the Times Victoria had realised her atelier could not make it in time so she had had to pick a different designer. Nicola denied there was a feud in the family.

But scrutiny continued, with shows of unity (from warm social media posts to shared events) being framed as the Beckhams putting the feud behind them, or discouraging rumours of discord.

Eventually, speculation seemed to die down. But reports of a rift returned last month after Brooklyn, 26, and Nicola, 30, were absent from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations and did not post a birthday message online. 

A source told the BBC Brooklyn had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman Brooklyn had previously been linked to. 

The source added that this woman's invitation had been a "big source of further tension".

Sir David and Lady Beckham have never acknowledged the rumoured rift, and have not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. 

Ms Beeching believes there is now a risk the feud stories could start to shape the family's image "instead of the achievements they actually want to be known for". "Once you start being spoken about like a reality TV family," she continues, "that reputation starts to slip."

As Manchester United's golden boy, David Beckham quickly transcended football to become a global celebrity.

He and Spice Girl wife Victoria created Brand Beckham - fusing fame, fashion and football to redefine modern stardom.

"Their brand has always been about control of narrative, image, and legacy," says Mr Borkowski. "The media didn't chase them. They gave it a trail to follow - blending scandal with strategy and high-end deals."

Beckham "made metrosexuality mainstream", he adds. "He showed working-class lads you could wear nail polish, model for Armani, champion grooming rituals - and still bend a free kick past the keeper at crunch time. All while embodying a very traditional ideal: devoted husband, hands-on dad, family first."

"I lived my career through the spotlight," Sir David told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2013. "You have to be a certain person, you have to create a certain person, and you have to be yourself."

These parallel identities - carefully constructed yet authentic - gave Beckham his unique pull.

While the Beckham family have always been relatively private, Ms Beeching sees David's 2023 Netflix documentary as a turning point in how the public perceived them.

"The Beckham brand has always been seen as aspirational, not accessible, but since the documentary, there's been a notable increase in how much the family share on their social media accounts, which puts them closer to being reality stars," she says.

Ms Beeching says recent news has pulled the family "away from legacy-building and into soap opera territory, which was never their lane".

The constant rumours about the family's dynamic have led some fans to take on a "Sherlock Holmes role" - so now, every absence in a photo becomes a hidden theory and every Instagram caption has a sub context.

Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, tells the BBC fans expect to see social signals of closeness such as mutual follows, birthday posts and supportive comments. 

"When these signals are missing, people don't assume neutrality, they assume tension." 

Fans and tabloids were quick to pick up on Brooklyn and Nicola's German Glamour magazine shoot earlier this month as a signal that the rift was far from over - the couple avoided mentioning the Beckhams, but Nicola's love for her own family was referenced several times. 

Since then, every Beckham Instagram post and like (or lack thereof) has been agonised over, and even if discussion of the feud are eventually put to bed, it is unlikely that social media sleuthing will end. 

Mr Navarra explains that even if facts are revealed and the rift rumours are quashed, "the social media algorithm doesn't care about accuracy - it cares about engagement". 

This feud is the "perfect storm as it's built to go viral", and social media does not just fuel speculation, it manufactures and rewards it, he says.

Of course, family drama is also more relatable than a knighthood, and there has always been an insatiable appetite for famous families feuding in the spotlight. 

Ms Beeching sees parallels between the Beckham family fallout and the rift between the Sussexes and the Royal Family, which continues to make headlines. 

"The Royal Family lost control over the narrative as Harry and Meghan became more independent, and that's the same here with Brooklyn and Nicola, who are both adults and are forming their own public personas," she says. 

Like Meghan, Nicola Peltz was already a known figure before marrying Brooklyn. The daughter of a billionaire businessman and model, "Nicola doesn't need to rely on the Beckhams for money or fame", says Wayne Barton, who wrote a biography about Beckham in 2020. 

In a bid to not be perceived as nepo babies - children of celebrities who get fast-tracked to success - "Brooklyn and Nicola are in search of their own identities, which "may be putting them at odds with the careful public image that the Beckhams have created for the family", he says.

Sir David's polished image has, on occasion, been tarnished by scandal - in 2003, he faced accusations of an extra-marital affair with his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos.

Nicole Lampert, the Daily Mail's showbiz editor at the time, says the Beckhams perfected "smiling through" issues - letting actions speak over words.

In 2004, the couple staged a photocall skiing together to demonstrate a united front - with Victoria giving what Lampert describes as a pained "rictus grin".

Generally, however, the Beckhams have remained tight-lipped when it comes to scandals, such as criticism over David Beckham's involvement with Qatar, and leaked emails in 2017 that included disparaging comments about singer Katherine Jenkins being awarded an honour over him.

Having been in the spotlight for decades, the Beckham brand will survive the feud and it is currently "bruised but not broken", according to Mr Navarra. 

One way the Beckhams could limit the damage to their brand would be by "showing family unity with a picture on social media or at least acknowledging that all families have their ups and downs", he suggests. 

But trying to inauthentically manage the situation and making things look overly staged could backfire and the "narrative of a feud will become permanently baked in".

Mr Navarra does not believe there are many real implications to the Beckham brand right now and the reports are not affecting their earning potential, brand collaborations or level of interest in them. 

"If anything, it humanises the family a bit," he explains, but he cautions there could be a greater impact on their reputation if the feud escalates or more damaging rumours come to light.

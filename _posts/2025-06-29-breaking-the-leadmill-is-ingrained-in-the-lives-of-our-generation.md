According to new developments, It is a venue that has been associated with music in Sheffield for 45 years, but The Leadmill has hosted its final gig and club night after losing a long battle with its landlords. For fans, musicians and the city it marks the end of an era.

For Neil White, a gig-goer in its heyday, the venue will always be "iconic".

"People of my age who came to uni in Sheffield, it's just so ingrained in our memories," the 52-year-old said.

"You feel part of Sheffield. It's the dirty brick. You feel like you're part of the steel city.

"What you are experiencing is gold because of the music."

For Mr White his memories are forever linked to those student nights and £1 vodka and Red Bulls in the 1990s.

"It was fantastic and people came here, week in and out. I remember the sticky floors."

For Sheffield guitarist and singer Richard Hawley, who has played with Pulp, The Leadmill was comparable to the other great northern cradles of live music.

"It's our Cavern Club, our Hacienda and once the doors close that history's wiped out," he said.

Hawley has played The Leadmill more than any other artist, from his first gig with his father and uncle aged 16, through to his most recent show 42 years later, at 58.

"I've danced on that floor with my wife and with friends who are not here any more.

"It's just a special place. It is so woven into the very fabric of who we are."

The Electric Group acquired the freehold to the building in 2017 and gave the management of The Leadmill notice to leave.

The owners have said that it will remain as a music venue, but a name change is likely.

Despite a long legal fight, The Leadmill's hopes to remain in the building ended in May.

Electric Group said: "What we are intending to do is refurbish the building to create a touring standard space, hosting the coolest club brands and music and live shows, just like we do in Brixton, Newcastle and Bristol."

Hawley has said he will not return to the venue on principle.

"I just really feel for the folks who work here and the people of Sheffield," he said.

"Because of the success of people like me, Arctic Monkeys, Pulp and all the other great bands, John McClure, the rave scene.

"It isn't right that somebody from outside who has got plenty of cash just goes 'I'll have that because that's really successful.' "

One of The Leadmill's members of staff who spoke about the impact of its closure was events assistant Mike Cross.

"I know a lot of Sheffield is feeling gutted," he said.

"It's hard to lose a grassroots venue, especially when they are the heartbeat of the community and provide so many people with a safe place."

He said it could also impact artists at the beginning of their musical careers with so many venues closing.

"It will potentially mean less and less homegrown British artists coming through," he added.

Allan and Paula Rickwood from Woodhouse, Sheffield, have been married for 41 years and have attended gigs at The Leadmill for four decades.

Mr Rickwood said the venue's draw over the years had been the range of artists it had supported.

"Bands like Pulp. a lot of people started out here.

"Just the way they are prepared to put on the local bands and then watch them grow. It's a great scene."

Mr Rickwood was not sure if he would return after the new owners took over.

However, his wife was more positive.

"I think I would come back to see how it is," she said.

Over the decades The Leadmill has hosted Pulp, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, The Stone Roses and Oasis.

At 21, Thomas Ball is too young to remember these bands in their pomp, but the student and his father Jonathon, 50, have attended recent gigs.

"I think it's the history," he said.

"I've been massively into music for years, seeing some of the bands who have started here and performed here I've always felt more of a connection than anywhere else."

He said the venue "felt a bit like a second home".

"Walking in there and seeing the same familiar faces – it will always be a special place for me."

Jonathon, who travels from Leicester to be part of the audiences, added: "We always keep an eye on who's performing.

"Its not the closest (venue), but any opportunity to come up. We saw The Kooks do a little impromptu acoustic set, but really The Leadmill is the home of Richard Hawley and we've seen him a few times."

His son added: "You see the same four to five walls, the same faces, the same people on the door, behind the bar. It feels more like a family in that sense."

Thomas was not convinced he would return following the closure.

"As much as I love the building, probably not.

"It would almost be a disservice to The Leadmill to go to the new venue. I can't do it. It just won't feel the same."

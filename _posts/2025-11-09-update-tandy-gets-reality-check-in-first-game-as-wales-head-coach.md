According to new developments, New Wales head coach Steve Tandy is a former Scotland and British and Irish Lions defence coach

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v Japan

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Sunday, 9 November Kick-off: 1740 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

New Wales head coach Steve Tandy says the 52-28 record defeat by Argentina in Cardiff has demonstrated the magnitude of the job he has taken on.

Tandy watched his side concede seven tries at Principality Stadium against the Pumas.

Wales are ranked 12th in the world and face Japan next Saturday before further tests against New Zealand and South Africa, who are the best two teams in the world.

"I always knew it was going to be a challenge," said Tandy.

"We're 12th in the world for a reason. We want to build something people can identify with and are excited about going forward.

"There's disappointment to concede 50 points and some of those were avoidable with concentration."

Argentina celebrated a record margin of victory and scored the most number of points in a game against Wales, but Tandy saw some shoots of positivity.

"The day ended in disappointment, but there's a lot to like around the group," he said.

"You could see what we've done over the last two weeks coming out, to score four tries was a real positive and we left a few out there."

The Pumas boasted 400 more caps than Tandy's side and their experience and class shone through.

"We've got boys with low cap numbers, that's the opportunity for us," said Tandy.

"I know the journey we're going to go on, I'm excited and energised by it. 

"I know today is the marker of how far we need to go. It's the line in the sand to probably give us something to work on. 

"We've been together as new coaches for two weeks. We've seen a lot of things we've worked on come out, but Test match rugby is unforgiving. 

"We understand that, but I'm motivated and excited by this group."

Wales hooker Dewi Lake, who is set to take over the captaincy for the remaining three autumn games after captain and open-side Jac Morgan suffered a dislocated shoulder, was frustrated with the outcome.

"To concede 50 points in a game where we had some good defensive sets was disappointing," said Lake.

"You could see the attacking game we want to play, the way this group wants to get the crowd into the game. 

"Lapses of concentration or bounces of the ball can hurt you when you're playing a team that's sixth in the world and are as good as Argentina. 

"It's always disappointing to lose the match but there were strides forward. 

"We'll take the positivity out of today... it's about bouncing back ahead of the next one."

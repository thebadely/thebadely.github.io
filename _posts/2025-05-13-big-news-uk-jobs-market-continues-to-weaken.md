Let's dive into the details: The UK's job market has continued to weaken with the number of workers on payrolls falling in the first quarter of the year.

The number of job vacancies also fell again, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.

Wage growth slowed, but pay is still rising faster than the rate of inflation.

Regular earnings, which exclude bonuses, grew at an annual pace of 5.6% in the first three months of the year.

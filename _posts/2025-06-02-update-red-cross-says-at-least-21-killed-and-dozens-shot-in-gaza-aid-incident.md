Let's dive into the details: A "mass casualty influx" of people, many with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, was received at a Red Cross field hospital in southern Gaza, the organisation said, following disputed reports about an incident near an aid distribution centre in Rafah.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said 21 people were "declared dead upon arrival" while women and children were among 179 cases.

The organisation's statement came after the Hamas-run civil defence agency in Gaza said at least 31 people were killed and many more wounded in the incident, which it blamed on "Israeli gunfire" targeting civilians.

But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said findings from an initial inquiry showed its forces had not fired at people while they were near or within the aid centre.

The IDF also released drone footage it said showed armed and masked men throwing stones and shooting at civilians while they were collecting aid in the nearby city of Khan Younis. The BBC could not immediately verify the footage.

Israel does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza, making verifying what is happening in the territory difficult.

The group that runs the aid distribution centre, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), also denied the claims of injuries and casualties at its site and said they had been spread by Hamas.

As of Sunday evening, the situation on the ground remained unclear.

In its statement, the ICRC said the "Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah received a mass casualty influx of 179 cases, including women and children" early in the morning on Sunday.

It said "the majority suffered gunshot or shrapnel wounds", and "twenty-one patients were declared dead upon arrival". It is unclear if the number of people killed reported by the ICRC is separate to the Hamas health ministry's reports.

"All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site," the ICRC said.

The ICRC said it was the "highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago", and that it "far surpassed" the capacity of the 60-bed facility.

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said in a statement that it had also responded to the "mass casualty" incident, and that the blood bank at Nasser hospital, where the injured were treated, was almost empty, with medical staff donating blood themselves to help the injured.  

Claire Manera, the organisation's emergency co-ordinator, said that the incident had "shown once again that this new system of aid delivery is dehumanising, dangerous and severely ineffective".

The IDF said in a statement: "In recent hours, false reports have been spread, including serious allegations against the IDF regarding fire toward Gazan residents in the area of the humanitarian aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip.

"Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false," it added.

MSF said at least two patients told them they and others had been shot while trying to get aid. MSF communications officer Nour Alsaqa said in a statement that as MSF staff were treating patients, they also "received confirmation that a colleague's brother had been killed while attempting to collect aid from the centre".

Another incident was said to have happened near a separate aid centre in the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, with the Palestinian Red Crescent reporting 14 injured.

The BBC was contacted by doctors at the Nasser hospital who said they had received about 200 people with injuries caused by bullets or shrapnel.

Local journalists and activists shared footage of bodies and wounded people being transported on donkey carts to the Red Cross field hospital in the al-Mawasi area.

The BBC has examined footage of bodies being carried on carts and in the back of lorries to Nasser Hospital.

Gaza's health ministry said more than 200 cases had arrived at hospitals, including 31 dead.

Seventy-nine of the injured were brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, according to the emergency department, medical staff from British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians reported.

⁠Those killed and injured "were primarily struck by live gunfire, with many victims sustaining direct shots to the head or chest", the charity's staff said.

Victoria Rose, a British surgeon who has been working at Nasser Hospital, recorded a video mid-morning in which she motions to the beds with patients behind her and says "all the bays are full and they're all gunshot wounds".

The GHF, which distributes aid at these sites, denied any incident occurred near its distribution centres.

An IDF soldier in Rafah contacted the BBC to say that Israeli soldiers did fire near the crowd, but not at them, and that no-one was hit.

Mohammed Ghareeb, a journalist in Rafah, told the BBC that Palestinians had gathered near the aid centre run by the GHF when Israeli tanks approached and opened fire on the crowd.

Mr Ghareeb said the crowd of Palestinians were near Al-Alam roundabout around 04:30 local time (02:30 BST), close to the aid centre run by GHF, shortly before Israeli tanks appeared and opened fire.

"The dead and wounded lay on the ground for a long time," he said.

"Rescue crews could not access the area, which is under Israeli control. This forced residents to use donkey carts to transport victims to the field hospital."

Mahmud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's main emergency service the Civil Defence, told AFP news agency that more than 100 people were wounded "due to gunfire from Israeli vehicles towards thousands of citizens".

The incidents underscore the dire humanitarian conditions in Rafah, where recent Israeli military operations have severely limited access to aid and emergency services.

On Saturday, crowds of civilians rushed aid trucks into Gaza, the World Food Programme said, as hunger and desperation created chaotic scenes.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is a new US and Israeli-backed organisation that has been distributing food at designated sites across Gaza. Israel set up the plan after accusing Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies.

The GHF said it had distributed 4.7 million meals this week, which the BBC has not been able to independently verify.

A military campaign was launched by Israel in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,418 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's health ministry.

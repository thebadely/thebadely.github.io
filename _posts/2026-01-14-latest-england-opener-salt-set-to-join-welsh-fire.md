According to new developments, Phil Salt made his England T20 debut against West Indies in January 2022

Welsh Fire are poised to announce England batter Phil Salt as one of their direct signings for the 2026 edition of The Hundred.

It is understood the 29-year-old opener, who previously played for Manchester Originals, will become one of Fire's top earners.

A source close to the Cardiff-based franchise said the arrival of Wales-born Salt represented a "real coup" given there was interest in him from other teams in The Hundred.

Salt has substantial global franchise experience, including the Indian Premier League, and has made 1,540 runs at 38.50 in 50 T20 internationals for England.

He was given a one-year central contract by England in November.

Teams are allowed to directly sign or retain four players before the auction - a new addition for this season - set to take place in March.

Fire are also planning to bring former Australia captain Ricky Ponting on board in a strategic advisory role.

The 51-year-old was initially said to be in the running to be Fire head coach but it is understood the side have decided to retain Mike Hussey in the position for this year's tournament.

Ponting, who played 560 times for Australia between 1995 and 2012, currently combines work as a television pundit with franchise coaching stints.

He is the head coach of Indian Premier League side Punjab Kings and Washington Freedom in USA's Major League Cricket.

IT entrepreneur and Freedom owner Sanjay Govil bought a 50% stake in Fire in last year's sale of the Hundred franchises, with county side Glamorgan holding the other 50%.

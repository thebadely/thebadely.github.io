Should Henderson have been sent off for handball?

Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson was the centre of attention during Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester City.

The England international, who superbly kept out Omar Marmoush's penalty by diving full stretch to his right among a string of fine saves, inspired the Eagles to a 1-0 win at Wembley.

But should the Palace number one have been on the pitch to make those vital interventions?

City defender Josko Gvardiol played a long ball over the top for Erling Haaland to chase on to and Henderson hesitated, before stretching out a hand outside the box to divert the ball away from the City striker.

As occurs with every decision, the video assistant referee (VAR) checked the incident and allowed play to continue without any sanction.

The explanation given was that the direction in which Haaland was going made it a possible - but not obvious - goalscoring opportunity.

Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney said on the BBC One coverage that it was "100% a red card" and called to "get rid of VAR".

Henderson's handball came just outside the box, pushing the ball away from goal and towards the corner flag.

Had he not got that touch, Haaland would have had the chance to control the ball and aim a strike towards goal, but Palace centre-back Maxence Lacroix had sprinted back to cover.

A goalkeeper handling the ball outside the box is not an automatic red card and VAR can only call the decision back for a dismissal, but decided Haaland was not denied a clear goalscoring opportunity.

City should have been given a free-kick outside the box, but referee Stuart Attwell failed to award it.

'How can they get this wrong?' - Rooney on Henderson handball

Guardiola cut an irritated figure in the immediate aftermath of the match, appearing to exchange words with Henderson on the pitch.

When later questioned about the confrontation he described it as "nothing", while he also refused to be drawn on the handball decision itself, replying simply: "Ask the referee."

Rooney, who won the FA Cup with victory for United against Palace in 2016, was incredulous on BBC punditry duty, saying: "It is a red card - 100% a red card.

"Erling Haaland is about to knock it around him and Dean Henderson sweeps the ball away.

"It is a red card - how can they get this wrong?"

After hearing the VAR reaction, Rooney added: "Just get rid of VAR.

"They have made a mistake and now they are trying to cover up. It is a red card and everyone can see it's a red card.

"To come out with all this rubbish..."

Former England captain Alan Shearer added: "Dean Henderson was slightly fortunate.

"The law is that he is running away from goal, but Henderson's also stopping a possible goalscoring opportunity."

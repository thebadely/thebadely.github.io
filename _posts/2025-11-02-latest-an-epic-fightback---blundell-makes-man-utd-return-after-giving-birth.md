Here’s what you need to know: Hannah Blundell, who helped Manchester United win their maiden FA Cup in 2024, is congratulated by her team-mates

An impressive Manchester United extended their unbeaten start to the Women's Super League season with a 3-2 win at Brighton on Sunday.

Their fifth win of the campaign means Marc Skinner's side are within striking distance of leaders Chelsea and Manchester City but the most profound moment of the game was one that many might have easily missed. 

Amid the celebrations that followed Jess Park's goal for United, right-back Hannah Blundell trotted on to the pitch as a substitute.

On the surface, it was just one of the three changes that Skinner made at the hour mark. 

But in reality, it was the culmination of a remarkable comeback as Blundell made her first appearance in over a year following the birth of her daughter, Romi. 

It came 533 days after her previous appearance on the final day of the 2023-24 season in a 6-0 defeat to her former side Chelsea, and made her the first United player in the professional era to return to play after giving birth.

"That felt good," Blundell wrote on Instagram after her half-hour cameo.

"First minutes back in the WSL after giving birth to my baby Romi. Long journey but wouldn't have got here without my team-mates, physios, coaches and of course my husband and daughter." 

Replacing Canada international Jayde Riviere, the 31-year-old helped United hold on for a win in a whirlwind finish. 

"Welcoming back Hannah after pregnancy is a fantastic story in itself," Skinner said. 

"I think I'll feel it on the way home in terms of the pride for her. She's been waiting a long time and worked extremely hard. 

"[Riviere is] playing well, so it's hard for her but when she came on she showed the true quality and class she already has, so I want to congratulate her on an epic fightback to come back." 

Hannah Blundell won four WSL titles during her time at Chelsea

Blundell, who joined from Chelsea in 2021, was a regular starter for United in her first three seasons and was a starter as the club lifted their first FA Cup in May 2024. 

Four months later, the club announced she was pregnant with her first child.

Blundell was in the final year of her contract when the announcement was made, but the club triggered a clause to keep her there for another year so she could access maternity pay and medical support.

Skinner was made aware of the pregnancy early on and recruited defenders in the transfer window before the start of last season. 

On 31 March this year, Blundell gave birth to her daughter by caesarean section. 

On 4 July she returned to Carrington for her first proper run after giving birth, with Romi in attendance in her pram. 

"As a footballer and someone who's always been active, being told to do nothing for six weeks was a real challenge," Blundell posted on Instagram after returning to training.

"But it was something I had to come to terms with mentally, knowing what my body had just been through to bring my baby into the world. 

"Fast forward three months, and being able to run again and start getting ready to return to football fills me with joy and excitement. But now I've also got an even bigger reason to push forward - my little girl." 

Blundell made more steps back with appearances for United's under-21s in September. 

"16 months since my last competitive match, I finally stepped back on the pitch," Blundell said back then. 

"Felt good to put this shirt back on. It's been a journey of patience, sacrifice, and resilience - but my love for football never left."

She made the matchday squad against Chelsea on 3 October and remained an unused substitute against Valerenga, Everton and Atletico Madrid last month before finally getting her comeback on Sunday.

Her former United team-mate Nikita Parris, who currently plays for London City Lionesses, was in awe of the full-back. 

"She has worked so hard to come back and get into a United squad that is competing on all fronts and has a lot of quality," Parris told Sky Sports. 

"But when you get an opportunity, you have to take it, which Hannah has done.

"The team sprit and the family feel they've created at United have carried them. It's an amazing dressing room to be part of and the girls really stick by each other and fight for each other."

Former Scotland captain Rachel Corsie believes Blundell's return could be a fillip for a United side eyeing a top-three finish in the WSL.

"It's a big boost for the players to see [Blundell] come back. That will give everyone a lot of energy when the fixtures come thick and fast," the former Aston Villa defender said.

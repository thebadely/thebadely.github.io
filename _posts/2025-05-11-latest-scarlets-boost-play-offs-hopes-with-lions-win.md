Scarlets boosted their United Rugby Championship play-off hopes with a bonus-point win over Lions.

A first victory on South African soil since the four South African franchises were introduced in 2021 came at the perfect time for Dwayne Peel's side, who are now up to sixth in the table with just one round to play.

Two tries from Blair Murray got them off to a perfect start in Johannesburg before Nico Steyn pulled one back.

Taine Plumtree restored Scarlets' lead after the break before two scores from Richard Kriel brought Lions right back into the contest.

Scarlets then squandered several opportunities in a nail-biting finish before Johnny Williams and Sam Costelow's boot got them over the line. 

While Lions' slim top eight chances are now over, Scarlets travel to Durban to take on Sharks who have already guaranteed their play-off spot.

Peel made just one change to his side after their impressive win against runaway league leaders Leinster, with Marnus van der Merwe preferred at hooker in his native South Africa.

Scarlets needed to repeat those heroics to keep their destiny in their own hands, but got off to a wobbly start with Plumtree narrowly avoiding a yellow card for a high tackle, while Sam Lousi spent 10 minutes in the sin bin for the same offence.

Despite a player disadvantage, Scarlets broke the deadlock with lineout ball setting up a good attacking platform and, after several carries from the forwards, the ball went through the hands of the backs, with Murray finishing neatly in the corner.

Lions then enjoyed a spell of pressure as momentum shifted in the sunshine, but the visitors' defence was up to the task as they held the ball up over the line.

Scarlets continued to threaten and an inside ball saw Ellis Mee carve up the midfield before being pulled down a few metres short, but quick ball saw Murray over for his second.

It was the perfect response from the full-back who had been touted as a potential bolter for Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions squad, but failed to make the cut.

But Scarlets were again reduced to 14 as Dan Davies â on for captain Josh Macleod - was shown a yellow card for an infringement, while Gareth Davies left the field clutching his chest.

Lions got back into the game with their powerful forwards eventually proving too much for Scarlets' defence, with Steyn sneaking over under the posts.

That looked to have been the final score of the half until Costelow attempted a drop-goal on the 40th minute which bounced over off the posts.

It was the sort of luck Scarlets needed if they were going to make history and claim a first win in South Africa since Bulls, Sharks, Stormers and Lions entered the league four years ago.

They came out in the second half still looking to throw the ball around and the third try was the pick of the bunch, Archie Hughes taking a quick tap off a scrum penalty before Williams, Costelow and Murray pulled off some slick passing.

Murray was held just short of the line, but Plumtree managed to ride the tackle and touch down to give Scarlets a little breathing space.

But Lions were never going to lie down on home turf, and Jarod Cairn picked up from the back of a solid scrum and exploited the blindside, with Quan Horn giving Kriel a walk-in on the wing.

Scarlets then blew three try-scoring chances, with perhaps the altitude to blame for some bizarre decision-making.

The first came from a driving maul, which was making great progress until it was brought down illegally by JC Pretorius who was sent to the sin bin.

Scarlets were then camped on the try line for multiple phases before a lazy knock-on, much to the frustration of Peel in the stands.

Joe Roberts was left blushing when the next chance came begging; he was clean through and only needed to pass the ball back inside to Williams, but instead went for a miracle ball out to Murray which sailed forward.

Murray was then on for his hat-trick with only one defender to beat, but his pass to Mee went astray. In the meantime, Lions kept their hopes alive with another score from Kriel.

They looked to push on as they returned to full strength, but Scarlets finally converted a chance as Williams and Vaea Fifita showed some class and composure in an exchange of passes which saw Williams over.

A final minute Costelow penalty sealed the win. 

But Scarlets will be left with some injury worries ahead of Saturday's crucial game against Sharks as Davies and Roberts both left the field in some discomfort.

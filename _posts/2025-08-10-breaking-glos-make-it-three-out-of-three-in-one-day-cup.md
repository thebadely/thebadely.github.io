Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gloucestershire won the T20 Blast last year, but last won the 50-over trophy in 2015 

Gloucestershire made it three wins out of three in the One-Day Cup as they beat Leicestershire Foxes in an exciting game at Bristol.

Foxes captain Peter Handscomb hit 107 as the Foxes reached 285-7, but despite 5-52 from promising 18-year-old Alex Green, Craig Miles' six saw the home side win by three wickets with nine balls to spare.

Lancashire won another thriller as they saw off Somerset by two wickets at Taunton, chasing down the hosts 250-7 in the penultimate over.

Emilio Gay hit an unbeaten 119 as Durham cruised to a seven-wicket win over Kent, while Middlesex beat Sussex by five wickets at Lord's.

Derbyshire Falcons thrashed Nottinghamshire Outlaws by 127 runs, Worcestershire Rapids had a comfortable 60-run win over struggling Essex and Warwickshire saw off Northamptonshire Steelbacks by 62 runs after Alex Davies made 123.

One-Day Cup tables

In a match between two sides with 100% records, Leicestershire quickly slipped to 22-3 after being asked to bat by Gloucestershire with Josh Shaw grabbing all three.

But a fifth-wicket stand of 115 between Handscomb and Ben Cox (61) brought the Foxes into the game as they eventually posted 285-7.

James Bracey and Cameron Bancroft (40) put on 105 for the first wicket as Gloucestershire started well in reply.

Bracey eventually fell for 96 from 106 balls, one of five wickets for Green to follow on from his 5-25 against Surrey on Wednesday.

Green's haul included two in two balls to reduce the hosts to 251-7, but Miles and Tommy Boorman got them over the line with a vital partnership of 35.

In the clash with their East Midlands rivals Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire made a mockery of the visitors' decision to bowl first in Derby.

Australian Caleb Jewell hit 60, while a seventh-wicket partnership of 100 in under eight overs from Ross Whiteley and Amrit Basra transformed the tempo.

Whiteley smashed 80 off 72 balls while Basra's 72 off 55 balls was his first half-century for Derbyshire as they posted 341-8.

Ben Slater made 68 in the chase, but when he was out to leave Notts 150-5, the writing was on the wall.

They were bowled out for 214 in the 39th over as Ben Aitchison picked up his best figures in the competition of 4-34 to help Derbyshire climb into the top three on run-rate.

Essex's miserable white-ball season continued with a comprehensive defeat at Chelmsford.

Worcestershire won the toss and decided to bat, and four half-centuries laid the platform for them to reach 340-9.

Kashif Ali top-scored with 80, captain Jake Libby hit 70 and opener Isaac Mohammed made 63, but it was 56 from 25 balls from Ethan Brookes that really pushed the score on, putting on 80 in only 6.1 overs with Ali for the fifth wicket.

Opener Robin Das continued his good form with 51 for Essex, but the Rapids picked up wickets with Brookes getting three to add to his runs.

And the result was effectively settled long before Essex were eventually bowled out for 280 in the 46th over for a third straight loss.

Arav Shetty impressed on his Lancashire debut with 3-34 off his 10 overs

Somerset had won their opening two games but were put in by Lancashire at Taunton.

Archie Vaughan hit 59 and Lewis Goldsworthy 63, but an impressive debut performance from off-spinner Arav Shetty with 3-34 reduced the hosts to 146-5.

A maiden List A half-century from Finley Hill (57) got Somerset to 250-7 and they then had the Red Rose 79-4, but Lancashire captain Marcus Harris' 95 turned things back in the visitors' favour, along with 65 from George Balderson.

From 225-5, they fell to 242-8, but Ollie Sutton was badly dropped by Vaughan with eight still needed and Tom Bailey cracked the winning boundary with eight balls to spare.

Middlesex won the toss at Lord's and did a good job in restricting Sussex to 255-9 in their innings.

Fynn Hudson-Prentice made 58 while Jack Carson's 73 was a personal List A top score, only three days after his maiden fifty.

But Joe Cracknell smashed 78 and Sam Robson struck 89 in a rapid second-wicket stand of 144 to put Middlesex well on course.

Three quick wickets from Henry Crocombe made things interesting as the hosts slipped to 217-5, but Luke Hollman and Nathan Fernandes batted sensibly to get over the line with 25 balls to spare.

In a rare match at Rugby, hosts Warwickshire reached 291-8 in their allotted overs against Northamptonshire.

Davies led the way with his century, while Kai Smith scored 50 as they impressively recovered from 32-4.

George Bartlett and Justin Broad got into the forties for Northants but both fell to the leg-spin of Taz Ali - and he took his maiden five-wicket haul of 5-43 as the Bears recorded their first win of the competition with the visitors all out for 229 in the 43rd over.

Kent won the toss at Beckenham, but a superb opening spell from Durham's 20-year-old Mitch Killeen reduced them to 25-3, and he eventually finished with 3-15 from his 10 overs.

Ben Compton got to 55 and captain Jack Leaning made 68 from 50 balls, but their total of 238-8 felt insufficient.

And so it proved as Gay dominated the home bowlers with 119 from 111 balls, an unbroken stand of 91 with Colin Ackermann seeing Durham home with 64 balls in hand to move second in the group.

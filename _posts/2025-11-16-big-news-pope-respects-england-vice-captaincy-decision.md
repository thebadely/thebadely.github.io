According to new developments, Ollie Pope is one of only five members of the England squad to have been part of the last Ashes tour four years ago

Ollie Pope said he respects England's decision to replace him with Harry Brook as vice-captain for the Ashes series.

Pope has been deputy for most of Ben Stokes' three years as Test skipper, stepping up to lead on five occasions - including England's last Test against India in July.

But the Surrey batter was demoted when the squad for the tour of Australia was named in September.

Director of cricket Rob Key explained the move by saying Brook, who became England's limited-overs captain in the summer, is a "better leader".

Pope said: "If they think that's the right thing for the team going forward, and obviously Brooky captaining the one-day stuff and the T20 stuff as well, that's absolutely fine by me and I respect the decision they've made."

The 27-year-old was speaking after making scores of 100 and 90 against England Lions in England's only Ashes warm-up match in Perth.

It was Pope's first time in the middle since playing in the County Championship two months ago.

He had a mixed summer for England, scoring hundreds in his first two innings - against Zimbabwe and India - then passing 50 only once in his next eight.

Pope said he has "worked" on "a couple of little technical bits" of his game, without revealing the full extent.

"Just smoothing out a few areas," he said.

With debate focusing on the quality and quantity of England's Ashes warm-up fixtures, Pope was one of the players who took full advantage of the three days at Lilac Hill.

"I always take a bit away from warm-up games. Even if I miss out, there's always something to take from it," he said.

"I'm someone who likes time in the middle just to get myself ready for a series. I found it really beneficial."

England's chance is now: Perth, the Optus & Ashes

Pope's runs against the Lions and back-up batter Jacob Bethell's lack of form until a second-innings 70 in the tour match has left no doubt over the identity of England's number three for the first Test against Australia at Optus Stadium on Friday.

Bethell has been challenging for that spot since making his Test debut a year ago, often leaving Pope's place in the England team as a subject of speculation.

"I've got so used to those conversations being had, and seeing them. I don't go looking for them but it's pretty hard to avoid sometimes," said Pope.

"I'm so used to seeing it I've just learned to focus on my game. Fingers crossed to get the nod for the first Test, but all the trust is in those guys and I respect the decision they make."

Pope is one of six players in England's 16-man squad to have been on the last Ashes tour four years ago.

On that occasion he was dropped after the first two Tests, only to return in the fifth as England were hammered 4-0.

And he believes the tussle with Bethell has made him a better player, pointing to his crucial century in the first Test against India at Headingley when the contest between the two was at its tightest.

"It's been good for me that I've learnt that under the most pressure I've been able to deliver, especially in that Headingley Test," said Pope.

"I know that I deal with that and get the best out of myself at times. Everyone wants to be the first name on the team sheet, but at the same time we're playing international sport.

"I've got to remind myself of that at times, there's always going to be someone on your heel if you haven't quite scored the volume of runs that you would have liked. I'm learning to live with it, and as long as I'm a better player than I was in every series I play, that's the best I can do."

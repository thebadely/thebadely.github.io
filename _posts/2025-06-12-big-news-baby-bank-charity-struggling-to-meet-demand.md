It has been recently reported that A charity that helps financially struggling parents of young babies has said it has seen a big increase in the number of families seeking assistance.

Tippy Toes in Lostock Hall, near Preston in Lancashire, describes itself as "a food bank with baby items".

Families with children from birth to four years old are provided with essential items including prams, nappies and formula.

Manager Sian Haddon said: "Week on week the referrals are coming in thick and fast and we're at the point where the demand on our service unfortunately is more than we can meet."

She told BBC Radio Lancashire: "We rely on the community for donations, people bring to us their pre-loved baby items, or are kind enough to go any buy things like formula, nappies and wipes for us.

"We are struggling to meet that demand now. With summer pending, people know that they've potentially got school uniforms to buy for older children.

"The cost of living is absolutely horrendous for everyone at the moment, even doing a weekly food shop, it's going up week by week, so adding on a £15 tin of formula is just unattainable."

Ms Haddon said some families come to them to "keep topped up" when they cannot afford to buy essential items every week.

Tippy Toes also helps expectant parents who are struggling.

"For them we give a full kit," she said. "And that can be a pram, a Moses basket with a brand new mattress, all their toiletries, a bag of baby clothes - basically everything you would go and buy for your newborn baby, we provide as a bundle."

The charity, based at the South Ribble Family Wellbeing Centre on Wilkinson Street,   was established in 2019.

"There's so many charities out there who are trying to get funding, so there's a lot of competition to get money and our shelves are empty week on week," Ms Haddon said.

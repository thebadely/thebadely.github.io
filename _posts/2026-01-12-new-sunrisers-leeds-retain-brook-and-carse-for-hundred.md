Experts revealed that Harry Brook and Brydon Carse both played all five Tests for England during the recent Ashes series in Australia

Sunrisers Leeds have retained England players Harry Brook and Brydon Carse for the 2026 edition of The Hundred, with Daniel Vettori named as the franchise's new men's head coach.

Multi-format internationals Brook and Carse have been with the team, known as Northern Superchargers until a recent takeover, since the tournament's 2021 inaugural season.

The Sun Group, owners of Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad, last year paid just over Â£100m for a 100% stake in the franchise who are based at Yorkshire's Headingley home.

Brook, 26, and Carse, 30, were both part of England's recent Ashes campaign and are in their provisional squad for the forthcoming T20 World Cup.

Test vice-captain and white-ball England skipper Brook came under scrutiny for his off-field behaviour before and during the Ashes, which Australia won 4-1.

Batter Brook played nine of the Superchargers' matches in the 2025 edition of The Hundred, scoring 227 runs at an average of 37.83 and is reportedly set to earn in the region of Â£500,000 for his participation with Sunrisers.

Fast bowler Carse did not feature at all last year in the competition, having been rested by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in order to manage his workload.

This summer's edition of The Hundred will run from 21 July to 16 August, taking place in a gap in the schedule between England's white-ball series against India and a Test series against Pakistan.

Sunrisers Leeds have also announced all-rounder Mitch Marsh and seamer Nathan Ellis as their direct signings, with the experienced Australian duo set to be available for the whole tournament.

Teams in The Hundred are allowed to make up to four pre-auction retentions or direct signings with the first-ever auction set to take place in March.

Former New Zealand spinner Vettori, 46, takes over from ex-England captain Andrew Flintoff as head coach of the men's franchise team.

Flintoff, 48, had been in charge of the Superchargers for the past two seasons but said he was "worth more" than what the Sunrisers offered him.

Vettori has been head coach of IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad since 2023.

"I am looking forward to the upcoming season with the Sunrisers and hope the orange army can fill the stands," Vettori said.

For their women's side, Sunrisers Leeds have retained Australia all-rounder Annabel Sutherland and batter Phoebe Litchfield along with England seamer Kate Cross.

The trio were a key part of the Northern Superchargers team who won the women's edition of The Hundred last year.

Litchfield was the tournament's leading run-scorer with 292 runs in 10 innings at an average of 41.71 while compatriot Sutherland made 206 runs at 51.50.

Sutherland finished as second-highest wicket taker with 16 at 14.43, one wicket ahead of Cross who averaged 14.06.

The franchise have changed their women's coach, with Lisa Keightley replaced by South African Adrian Birrell.

Australian Keightley guided the Superchargers to their title last summer before replacing Charlotte Edwards as coach of Women's Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians.

Elsewhere, England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt will remain at Trent Rockets, while big-hitting Australian Tim David has joined.

A 49% stake in the Rockets was purchased last year by the Cain International group, which includes Chelsea Football Club owner Todd Boehly. 

David has previously played in the competition for Southern Brave and becomes Rockets' first men's signing before the new season.

England all-rounder Alice Capsey has moved from Oval Invincibles to Birmingham Phoenix.

Capsey's prominence rose in the first edition of the Hundred and she is the eighth-highest run-scorer in the five-year history of the women's competition.

She joins Australia's Ellyse Perry, who had already been announced, while England duo Jacob Bethell and Rehan Ahmed will feature for the men's Phoenix side.

Here’s what you need to know: Oliver Tarvet will make his Grand Slam main-draw debut after coming through Wimbledon qualifying

British qualifier Oliver Tarvet has called for a change in United States college rules after being unable to claim all the prize money he will earn from reaching the Wimbledon main draw.

Tarvet, 21, moved into the first round - where players receive Â£66,000 - after winning his third and final qualifying match on Thursday.

The Englishman studies at the University of San Diego and has developed his game in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) system.

Under NCAA rules, players are restricted in how much they can claim from professional tournaments.

On Friday, Tarvet explained players are allowed $10,000 (Â£7,290) in profit every year, as well as any expenses incurred during the events.

"I know there have been complaints about it but I don't want to speak too much about it and overstep the mark," he said.

"But in my opinion, I've worked hard to get this money. I don't feel like it's undeserved the money that I've got. 

"I think it would be good to see a change in the rules of the NCAA, but at the same time, I don't want to get involved. It's not really my place. 

"But I've done well this week. I think I deserve this money."

Earlier this year, American college player Reese Brantmeier launched a class action, external against the NCAA over the restrictions.

Brantmeier, 20, was joined by Australian player Maya Joint - who forfeited more than $200,000 (Â£145,000) in US Open prize money after reaching the fourth round last year - as a co-plaintiff.

Britain's Jay Clarke believes there is still a "barrier" stopping young black tennis players from developing in the UK.

Last month, the LTA launched its 'equity, diversity and inclusion plan', saying it will "not be satisfied until the diversity of everyone involved in tennis reflects the diversity of the communities in the country".

Clarke, 26, is among several British professional players with black or mixed heritage, including Heather Watson, Paul Jubb and George Loffhagen.

"It is nice to see more black players breaking through and hopefully we can inspire more kids to pick up a racquet," said Clarke, who plays Dan Evans in the Wimbledon first round.

"I think there is still a barrier and the sport is not amazingly accessible for black players. 

"The LTA have done good things to resurface park courts and give people opportunities.

"The most important thing is seeing people like yourself playing and doing well on the big stages. Representation is important."

This summer, Wimbledon is marking the 50th anniversary of Arthur Ashe's victory at the All England Club - the first black tennis player to win a Grand Slam men's singles title

Ashe, who won three major titles, has been one of Clarke's biggest inspirations after being told the American player's story.

"Having a black man win Wimbledon was amazing for my dad to see and that was passed on to me," Clarke added.

"I watched highlights of him when I was younger and my dad used to get me to play differently - that's how I learned to play the sport."

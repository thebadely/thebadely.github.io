Here’s what you need to know: Nottinghamshire won their first County Championship title since 2015

The Trent Bridge recycling bins are full to the brim with empty champagne bottles and Mariah Carey is mere weeks away from warming up her vocal cords for the festive season.

It can only mean one thing - we're into the final hours of domestic cricket in 2025 and it's time to reveal who made your County Championship team of the season.

Just under 29,000 teams have been picked by readers of the BBC Sport website and app over the past week - and we can now reveal which 11 players were the most selected.

For the third straight season, nine different counties are represented, but it's an entirely new XI for 2025, while three of the team plied their trade in Division Two this summer.

Here is the team of the season, as chosen by you, the BBC Sport users.

Player statistics correct as of Friday, 26 September, after close of play on the penultimate day of the season

Haseeb Hameed and Dom Sibley were the overwhelming choice as openers

HASEEB HAMEED (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE) â selected by 64% of users who voted

1,258 runs, average 66.21, four centuries, five half-centuries

Haseeb Hameed's century in the final-game victory over Warwickshire rubber-stamped his ability to lead from the front and set the tone for the new county champions.

The former England batter passed 1,000 runs for the second successive season to underline that he is one of the country's most consistent performers.

His powers of concentration have never been in question and a stay of more than seven hours in scoring a double-hundred to ensure a draw against Somerset in July once again showed his nerveless temperament.

That coolness under pressure was also put to good use with his captaincy, particularly when ringing his bowling changes in the vital win over Surrey at The Kia  Oval.

DOM SIBLEY (SURREY) - 64%

1,274 runs, average 60.66, four centuries, six half-centuries

Dom Sibley has always been a run scorer - but now he's a run scorer who has managed to improve his strike rate to keep up with the modern game.

Once described as obdurate and stubborn he may not be seen as a dasher but more than 1,200 runs at a rate of 45.9 with a triple century against Durham makes him one of the stand-out performers at the top of any batting order this season.

Saif Zaib, Tom Abell and Marcus Harris are your middle-order batters

SAIF ZAIB - (NORTHAMPTONSHIRE) - 61%

1,387 runs, average 66.04, six centuries, six half-centuries

Saif Zaib has been a beacon of light in a season of struggle for Northamptonshire.

Batting at number five, he has often been called upon to rescue a brittle batting line-up from which no other batter features in Division Two's top twenty run-scorers.

He converted six of his 12 50-plus scores into three figures while also chipping in with 13 wickets with his slow left-armers.

The good news for Northants fans is he remains under contract until the end of the 2027 season.

TOM ABELL (SOMERSET) â 52%

1,022 runs, average 51.10, three centuries, five half-centuries

Though his side's push for a maiden Division One title faltered in the final month of the season, 2025 was another fine year for Tom Abell.

A century in the penultimate round was his third of the campaign and saw him into four figures for the season with an average of more than 50.

The 31-year-old also helped his club to the T20 Blast title.

MARCUS HARRIS (LANCASHIRE) - 46%

1,027 runs, average 60.41, three centuries, five half-centuries

Former Australia Test batter Marcus Harris has had a year to remember after joining Lancashire.

The 33-year-old initially signed as an overseas for the Championship and One-Day Cup this summer but swiftly put pen to paper on a deal for another two years.

The former Leicestershire and Gloucestershire man - who has won 14 Test caps - made a blistering start, passing 800 runs in May, though his momentum did wane in the second half of the season as Lancashire were unable to mount a push for promotion from Division Two.

Having been part of the 2024 team, Glamorgan's Colin Ingram was edged into fourth in the voting by Harris.

John Simpson guided Sussex to Division One safety

JOHN SIMPSON (SUSSEX) â 39%

1,086 runs, average 60.33, four centuries, four half-centuries, 54 dismissals

The tightest battle of all was for the gloves as Sussex skipper John Simpson accrued just over 750 votes more than Somerset's James Rew (37%).

He may have scored fewer runs, but veteran Simpson's better average and more dismissals gave him the edge over the youngster.

The left-hander has been a man transformed with the bat since making the move from Middlesex to Hove, passing 1,000 runs for the second successive year with his unbeaten 129 in the three-day win over Worcestershire.

Perhaps even more satisfying than that, though, was helping ensure that Sussex retain their Division One status for another season following promotion in 2024.  

Rehan Ahmed led the way with bat and ball as Leicestershire returned to the top flight

REHAN AHMED (LEICESTERSHIRE) - 57%

760 runs, average 50.66, five centuries, one half-century, 23 wickets, average 19.00

Landslide winner of the all-rounder spot â the next closest choices were James Coles (Sussex) and Ed Barnard (Warwickshire) with 10%

Can it really be almost three years since Rehan Ahmed made his England Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi?

There has not been any addition to his five caps so far in the past year, but he remains in the selectors' T20 plans and some feel he was unlucky to miss out on a winter Ashes tour.

It is Ahmed's batting that has stood out this summer, helping Leicestershire win promotion back to County Championship Division One for the first time in 22 years.

He made four centuries in five innings between May and July and also weighed in with a couple of five-wicket hauls, including a career-best 7-93 against Derbyshire.

Somerset spinner Jack Leach was the most overwhelming choice of the entire team

JACK LEACH (SOMERSET) â 83%

52 wickets, average 22.78

With more than 21,000 votes more than any other specialist spinner, there was only one contender to offer a bit of turn.

It has not been a great summer for spinners in the domestic game but Jack Leach's half century of wickets was 12 more than any other slow bowler.

Not playing for England this summer has meant the left-armer turning out in all 14 Championship games and he has contributed four or more wickets on six occasions, with best figures of 7-69 against Hampshire earlier this month.

Once again a first title has eluded the Cider Boys, but Leach's presence means they are always a threat on a turning track.

Kyle Abbott, Josh Tongue and Tom Taylor were your picks for the seam attack

KYLE ABBOTT (HAMPSHIRE) â 69%

56 wickets, average 20.69

Evergreen Hampshire bowler Kyle Abbott was the overwhelming choice to take the new ball in your team of the year.

Unlike previous seasons the 38-year-old former South Africa seamer might have had to operate without the support of Mo Abbas and Keith Barker for much of this season but despite his side's struggles on the field, he has continued to produce the goods.

His eight wickets in this week's match with Surrey took him to 56 for the season and 478 in first-class matches for the southern county, and he's not stopping there, having signed a new one-year deal earlier this month.

All that remains to be seen is whether that is in Division One or Two.

JOSH TONGUE - (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE) - 60%

31 wickets, average 22.03

What a year 2025 is proving to be for Josh Tongue. The 27-year-old began it with an England Lions stint and then made his first-class debut for Notts, having missed 2024 through injury.

He made a maiden half-century and took a five-for on debut against Durham and helped bring the County Championship crown back to Trent Bridge for the first time since 2010.

He was part of the England Test squad against India this summer and has been named in the party for the Ashes trip Down Under. Can 2026 follow 2025 for Tongue?

TOM TAYLOR (WORCESTERSHIRE) - 50%

58 wickets, average 22.87

The 2025 season may have ended on a low for his club, as the Pears were relegated back to Division Two after two seasons in the top flight, but it was a season to remember for Tom Taylor.

The 30-year-old former Leicestershire and Northants man added four wickets in each innings of the final round defeat to Sussex to finish with 58 victims for the season - not bad for someone officially listed as an all-rounder.

Essex's Jamie Porter, who made the 2024 Team of the Year just missed out this time with 47%.

Experts revealed that Premier Intermediate League sides Moyola Park and Newry City caused major upsets in the second round of the BetMcLean Cup on Tuesday night as they defeated Irish Premiership teams Dungannon Swifts and Glenavon.

A goal in the very first minute from Lee McLaughlin proved enough for Moyola, who lead the third tier of the Northern Ireland Football League, to see off the Irish Cup holders 1-0 at Stangmore Park and advance to the quarter-finals.

Newry's goal after a mere 42 seconds through Keith Dalton's stunning strike at Newry Showgrounds gave them victory by the same scoreline over top flight basement side Glenavon.

Elsewhere, strikes from Jonathan Russell and David Fisher proved enough for last year's beaten finalists Glentoran to see off Crusaders 2-1 in an all-Premiership tie at the Oval.

Kurtis Forsythe grabbed a late consolation for the visitors.

Coleraine marched into the last eight with a thumping 7-1 win at home to Armagh City, Rowan McDonald opening the scoring and with Oliver Devlin, Lewis McGregor and Declan McManus all on target twice.

Ben Mullen netted late on for the Championship side.

Tiarnan O'Connor was another who grabbed a double on the night as his second-half salvo edged Larne past Bangor 2-1 at Inver Park.

Seven minutes after his introduction, O'Connor headed home Conor McKendry's cross from close-range and added his and Larne's second on 84 minutes with a curling strike. Ben Arthurs reduced the deficit for the Seasiders with a consolation goal three minutes from time.

Meanwhile three second-half goals ensured Ballymena United's passage into the last eight at the expense of Championship opponents Newington at the Showgrounds.

Danny Lafferty, Success Edogun and Calvin McCurry were the scorers for the Sky Blues in their 3-0 victory.

The two remaining second-round ties take place on Wednesday night as Cliftonville host Strabane Athletic and Linfield are away to H&W Welders.

In the Belfast derby at the Oval, the home side got off to the perfect start as they took the lead in the opening minute when visiting goalkeeper Musa Dibaga failed to deal with Fisher's curling delivery into the box and Russell nodded home at the back post.

Minutes later Crusaders had their first, and only, chance of the half after a poor clearance from Billy Crellin gave Adam Brooks a good opportunity, but the Glentoran stopper recovered and diverted the resulting shot out of play.

The home side dominated the rest of the half with Liam Burt's shot cleared off the line by Odhran McCart and Ryan Cooney's free-kick landing narrowly wide of the left-hand post.

In the 25th minute, Jordan Jenkins came close to extending Glentoran's advantage, but his strike crashed off the outside of the right-hand post.

Declan Devine's side would extend their lead before the break though as, with just three minutes to go, Fisher fired home Jenkins' cross.

After the restart, the Glens continued to enjoy more possession with James Singleton's shot from the edge of the box denied by the woodwork on 71 minutes.

During the 90th minute, Forsythe's shot from the edge of the box found the back of the net to set up a nervy final few minutes for the Glentoran fans.

However, despite pushing until the final whistle, Declan Caddell's side couldn't find another late goal to equalise.

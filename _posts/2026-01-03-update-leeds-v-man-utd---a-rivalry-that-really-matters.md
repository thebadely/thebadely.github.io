It has been recently reported that Leeds have not beaten Manchester United at Elland Road since 2002

In his best-selling 'Managing My Life' autobiography, Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on his feelings about a trip to Elland Road.

"The crowd invariably give us the impression that a lynching would be too good for us," he said.

After a typically fraught League Cup victory there in 2011, Ferguson offered this observation too: "I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects. But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never."

Leeds have already hosted a couple of historic rivals in December, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home and producing an epic fightback to snatch a point in a 3-3 draw against Liverpool.

But a visit from Manchester United is something else.

"I have a decorating firm and for 40 years we have had the motto that we will not use red paint," said lifelong Leeds fan Gary Edwards.

"We will paint over red free of charge. It's still going to this day. It's on all the business cards and letterheads."

The actual origins of the rivalry are difficult to pinpoint.

Many feel it dates to the War of the Roses in the 15th century, although that is probably too simplistic given the Duchy and Dukedom of the Houses of York and Lancaster had little to do with the cities themselves and the Duchy of Lancaster had land and offices in Yorkshire.

Others think the rivalry has its origins in the industrial revolution which does, at least in part, correspond to the emergence of football as an organised sport - even if neither club, either originally as Leeds City and Newton Heath, or their current names, came to real prominence until after the Second World War.

Possibly, the reverence from the 1950s and beyond for the Busby Babes compared to the negativity around Don Revie's team in the 1960s and 70s, is a factor.

The knowledge that key players - Johnny Giles, Gordon Strachan, Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Denis Irwin and Eric Cantona among them - left one club to become an integral part of the success of the other is another. Also, the proximity of the best supported teams from the two biggest cities in two neighbouring counties, separated geographically, by the Pennines.

Whatever it is, the rivalry is real and despite the early 12:30 GMT kick-off, Elland Road is guaranteed to be a cauldron as Leeds look for their first home victory over Manchester United in the Premier League since 2002, when Harry Kewell scored the winner.

Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was in goal for Leeds that day and told BBC Sport: "One hundred percent it feels different.

"You get to the stadium two hours before kick-off and certain areas are sectioned off. There are police here, you can't drive there. This road is closed, that road is closed.

"It is as intense as any derby that you want to name in this country - and it is not friendly.

"I grew up as a kid in the Leeds academy and was a ball boy at some games. The away section used to be in the cheese wedge in the corner of Elland Road. For most of the season, nobody wanted to be a ball boy in that corner. But when Manchester United came to town, everybody wanted to be over in that corner, for whatever reason.

"It was just a different game and a different experience."

Neither manager has been part of a Leeds-Manchester United game before.

Leeds boss Daniel Farke knows it is a game that means a lot for his club's fans and is talking about making "dreams come true".

Manchester United's Portuguese head coach Ruben Amorim has been at the centre of the DÃ©rbi de Lisboa, as a player for Benfica and a coach at Lisbon rivals Sporting.

He is not sure the comparison is particularly helpful.

"I heard it is a big rivalry and a big derby," said Amorim.

"It is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies and different histories. It's a game in a hostile environment and that is going to be hard for any player. But when you play for Manchester United, you need to be ready for everything."

Leeds' last title-winning campaign in 1992 was made more satisfying because they won it at the expense of Manchester United, who were in control of their own destiny until a run of three successive defeats in the space of seven days right at the end of the season let Howard Wilkinson's side in.

Sadly for Leeds, the post-script came the following November, when chief executive Bill Fotherby rang Manchester United counterpart Martin Edwards to ask about the chances of bringing full-back Irwin back to the club.

Ferguson was in the room and said no to Irwin leaving, but told Edwards to mention the availability of French forward Cantona. It was a call that changed the course of English footballing history.

"I've never forgiven Bill for that," says Gary Edwards.

Maybe one of the reasons why Leeds' rivalry with Manchester United doesn't spring to mind in the same way as others in England is the relative infrequency of it happening.

Apart from the 14-year spell that began with Leeds' top-flight promotion in 1990 and relegation in 2004, the two clubs met only eight times in the other 30 years from 1982. Leeds won once in 2010, as a League One side at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and lost on five occasions.

The two clubs' fans don't forget though.

"Even when Leeds were in League One and the Championship, Manchester United still sang a song about teams they didn't like and tagged 'and Leeds' on to it," said Robinson, who had six years at Leeds before joining Tottenham in 2004.

"Week in, week out, no matter what league they are in or who they are playing against, Leeds fans take great pride in describing their dislike of Manchester United."

Leeds go into the game in better form, having added a goalless New Year's Day draw against Liverpool at Anfield to their home comeback against Arne Slot's men to take their current unbeaten record to six games and move seven points clear of relegation in 16th place. It is their best top-flight form since April 2021, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge.

By contrast, sixth-placed Manchester United have just three wins since the end of October and on 30 December failed to beat a Wolves side who prior to that game had picked up just two points all season.

Regardless, Robinson believes there are some Leeds fans for whom a successful season this time around would be to finish 17th and beat Manchester United.

"That does exist," said Gary Edwards. "I'm not quite like that, but 100% there are fans who think that way.

"I just feel it is as good a time to play them as any because we have turned a corner.

"We've kept the same formation and the same players who looked dire at the start of the season are now assured and confident.

"It will make the game interesting. Very, very interesting."

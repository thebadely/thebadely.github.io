Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The British and Irish Lions play three Tests in Australia

The British and Irish Lions will have names on the backs of jerseys for the first time in their history this summer.

Andy Farrell's side meet Argentina at the Aviva Stadium on Friday evening, before the nine-game tour of Australia.

The decision to put player names on the touring side's famous red jerseys for every game was approved by the Lions board after consultations with former and current players.

The measure is expected to help casual fans of the game identify those on the field during play, and it will also enable supporters to buy replica shirts for an individual player.

England have had player names on the backs of shirts since the Autumn Nations series of 2022, with Scotland quick to follow suit.

Ireland waited until a World Cup warm-up fixture against Italy in 2023, but by the time of the 2024 Six Nations all sides in the competition were doing so.

While the change to player jerseys will be one significant first for the tour to Australia, another will not be golden-point extra time.

Rugby Australia had suggested the sudden-death method to avoid a repeat of the Lions' 2017 series draw against New Zealand.

But despite Australia's preference for a golden point tie-breaker, it is understood the concept has been rejected by the Lions. It means any Test level after 80 minutes will end as a draw.

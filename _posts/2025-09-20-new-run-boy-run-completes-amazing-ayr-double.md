Let's dive into the details: Both Candy and Run Boy Run carried the silks of owner Phil Cunningham.

Run Boy Run won the Ayr Gold Cup to give trainer Richard Spencer a famous sprint double.

Jockey George Wood steered home the 12-1 shot just over an hour after enjoying another victory on 8-1 Candy in the Silver Cup.

With owner Phil Cunningham watching on, Wood delivered a great ride to see off Desert Falcon and Jubilee Walk who crossed the line in second and third.

Strong favourite Purosangue finished fourth.

Spencer told ITV Racing: "He ran in the Portland the other day and he ran really well and George and I had a chat after and he was thinking he didn't go hard enough.

"We thought we were the wrong side of the draw [six] but he is very fast, he holds a good cruising speed and he gave him a great ride."

Cunningham was visibly overwhelmed after the race and felt emotional after the double.

"It's amazing, absolutely amazing," he said.

"What about the jockey? He's done a lot of work with us over the last couple of years and I can't thank George enough."

Wood added: "We came up here with 11 runners in total with Richard and Phil and fair play we came up with some big chances and it's great to come away with the two big ones."

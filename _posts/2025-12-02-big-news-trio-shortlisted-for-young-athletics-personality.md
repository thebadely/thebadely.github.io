Experts revealed that Agyemang, Littler and Perrin are contenders for this year's award

England footballer Michelle Agyemang, darts player Luke Littler and cricketer Davina Perrin have been shortlisted for the 2025 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award.

The trio have been recognised for their outstanding achievements over the past 12 months.

Agyemang helped the Lionesses win Euro 2025, Littler won the world title for the first time, and Perrin surged to prominence with a record-breaking innings. 

Littler won the award - the first darts player to do so - in 2024 after his breakthrough year.

The three contenders were announced live on the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Greg.

The shortlist was compiled by a panel who will also decide the winner. They will be revealed live on the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show on Thursday, 18 December.

The show will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 19:00 GMT.

Just three months after her international debut, Agyemang played a dramatic and decisive role in England's run to Euro 2025 glory - coming off the bench to score crucial late equalisers in both the quarter-final and semi-final. 

Agyemang's stunning interventions led to her being named Young Player of the Tournament, and later in the year she was awarded the Golden Girl trophy, which is given to the best young player in Europe. 

She was also nominated for the Kopa Trophy for the world's best under-21 female player. 

Agyemang, who has been on loan at Brighton from Arsenal since September 2024, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament playing for the Lionesses in October.

Agyemang said: "Being on the shortlist for BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year is an honour.

"I thank God and I'm appreciative of the support I've received from my family, coaches, team-mates and fans - I appreciate you all."

Littler's 2025 began in sensational style as - aged 17 - he became the youngest darts world champion in history with a dominant victory over Michael van Gerwen in the final.

His subsequent victory at the World Matchplay made him only the fifth player to complete the PDC Triple Crown of World Championship, Premier League and Matchplay titles.

And he wasn't finished there - his triumph in November's Grand Slam of Darts meant he climbed to world number one for the first time. At 18, he is the youngest man to do so - smashing the previous record set by a 24-year-old Van Gerwen.

Littler said: "Being nominated for Young Sports Personality of the Year again is a big honour. Last year's win was a proud moment for me and I've had another incredible 12 months. 

"I want to continue raising the profile of darts and bringing new fans into the sport."

Perrin is one of English cricket's most exciting young talents, and surged to prominence with an extraordinary and record-breaking innings in August. 

Her sublime 42-ball century for the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred is the fastest by an English woman in T20s, and the joint third-fastest women's T20 century in a major league or full member T20 international. Only England men's player Harry Brook has scored a quicker century in The Hundred. 

Perrin finished second in the run-scoring charts as the Bears reached the Women's T20 Blast Finals day, and was named PCA Women's Young Player of the Year.

Perrin said: "I'm truly honoured to be shortlisted for the Young Sports Personality of the Year award. It's a very special feeling and I hope it inspires more young females to get into cricket."

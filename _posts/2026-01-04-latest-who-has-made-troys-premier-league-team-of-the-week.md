Let's dive into the details: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Emi Martinez (Aston Villa): It is going to sound very strange because it was a very comfortable Aston Villa win, but he made some key saves from Morgan Gibbs-White in the second half - just after Nottingham Forest got a goal back and it went to 2-1. He just kept them in the game.

Matty Cash (Aston Villa): He was excellent. He has been excellent for a few weeks now but a massive outlet for Aston Villa. When they are dominant on the ball, he's the outlet on the right-hand side and got a lovely little assist in there as well. He is the main outlet and he really jumps off the pitch when you are watching the games.

Malick Thiaw (Newcastle): From November onwards, he has been exceptional. He had a tough time in Italy but he is delivering consistently now. He scores a goal, which always helps for any defender in this team of the week. Solid performance, delivered, was more aggressive and I feel like he is starting to get his bearings now and feel like he is the man at Newcastle.

Nathan Collins (Brentford): Goal and an assist with the flick-on. I just think when they first signed him from Wolves, I didn't get it. Now I do. Especially under Keith Andrews. He organises well, he moves the ball really strongly from the back. He is the leader of that team. Forget Jordan Henderson, he is the leader of that team. Obviously goals help at centre-back.

Ben Davies (Tottenham): I don't think this is a name I ever thought I was going to put in but Ben Davies, fair play to him. He plays only his third game of the season, starts, they had Djed Spence on the bench as well - which shows the level of professionalism and maturity that he continues to deliver - and he gets a goal. It just shows to me that you don't always have to be 37 and written off. He's 32 and he's already been written off, he's got a World Cup to hopefully go to with Wales. He is always fit and available, which is what I really like.

Declan Rice (Arsenal): Two goals, leader, future England captain - do we need to say anything else?

Mateus Mane (Wolves): Eighteen years old, England youth international, doesn't have any noise, hasn't got any brothers with T-shirts saying to 'free him and let him play'. He goes out, plays, scores goals, gets an assist, gets the penalty and just delivers with no fuss. How beautiful is that? No fuss. I saw his interview after the game, he doesn't complain, doesn't get too over the top, just simple. Love it.

John McGinn (Aston Villa): He obviously has to be in here. Two goals, the second goal he is obviously buzzing because the keeper made it so easy for him - but it feels like he has had a love-hate relationship with Unai Emery for about three years now. It has started to come to fruition. He has been a really important piece for this Aston Villa side.

Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): He gets a goal and it probably should have been the match-winner for Man City if we are being totally honest. They will feel like they should have won that game. Reijnders has got three goals in his last four matches and that shows his importance. He is growing. He had a really good start and then I think the reality of English football caught up with him for a period, but now he has got his second wind and he is playing well. He is going to be really important if City are to try to catch Arsenal.

Igor Thiago (Brentford): Like me, you probably took him out of your fantasy football team thinking he had fallen off a cliff, and then he has scored every week since. So that just basically says more about my fantasy football managerial ability more than anything to do with his performances! But he is the rock, the leader, making sure he is right up there for that conversation for Brazil with the World Cup squad. You've got Joao Pedro, Richarlison, Gabriel Jesus - these are the guys who are all being spoken about. Even Neymar, but he's the one with the most goals, he is the one delivering with the most performances week in, week out. I'm backing him to make the squad.

Cody Gakpo (Liverpool): It was a game where Liverpool will feel they should have won it, nicking it in the 94th minute and then obviously Fulham score in the 97th minute. I think it is just one of those moments where you look at the team and you think no Hugo Ekitike, no Alexander Isak, who is going to step up and score the goals? To be fair to him, he's done it all season and that's why he goes in.

Rob Edwards (Wolves): First win for Wolves, a massive game against West Ham. I think in those games, because I have played in them, you need your manager to be resolute. To get you up but not get you over the edge and I think he just had both the tactics and emotion of the game spot on. Didn't go over the needle, didn't go under it and his team obviously delivered a massive 3-0 victory which gives them a fight - because if they had lost that game, relegation would have been all done and dusted. Now, hopefully they can get another win in the week and build on that momentum. For right now, it's huge for him and thankfully it is the first time we say something positive about Wolves all season - so massive kudos to Rob and his team.

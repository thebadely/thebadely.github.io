Let's dive into the details: Kevin Muscat is four games away from retaining the Chinese title with Shanghai Port

Rangers are close to agreeing a deal to secure Kevin Muscat as their new head coach with personal terms and details still to be finalised. 

The 52-year-old former Ibrox defender is currently in charge of Chinese league leaders Shanghai Port, who have four games left in their season. 

One of the key issues holding up an announcement is Shanghai's match against Quingdao Hainiu, which takes place at 11:00 BST on Friday. 

It is understood Rangers and Muscat are sensitive about upsetting plans for that match by formally agreeing a deal between both clubs before kick-off.

Rangers are also working to secure Muscat's backroom team and tie up all the relevant paperwork needed for the Australian to coach in Scotland. 

Youth coach Stevie Smith will take charge of the side for Saturday's league match against Dundee United at Ibrox, but it is yet unclear who will be in the dug-out for the Europa League game away Brann Bergen on Thursday.

Muscat emerged as favourite for the job after former manager Steven Gerrard withdrew his candidature at the weekend saying the timing was not right for him to return to Ibrox.

Former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Rohl was also under consideration, but the German also pulled out the race on Wednesday.

Crawley-born Muscat, who spent a season as a Rangers player, started his coaching career with Melbourne Victory, with whom he won the A-League title.

After a less successful spell with Sint-Truiden in Belgium, he led Yokohama F Marinos to the J-League title before taking charge of Shanghai in 2023, won the title last season and is four games away from retaining it this term.

Rangers were left seeking a new head coach after sacking former Southampton boss Russell Martin just 17 games into the ex-Ibrox defender's reign.

The Glasgow side head into Saturday's game against United sitting eighth in the Scottish Premiership, nine points behind city rivals and reigning champions Celtic - and two more adrift of leaders Heart of Midlothian.

They also failed to qualify for the Champions League and have lost both their Europa League games so far.

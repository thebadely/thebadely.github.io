Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kipyegon has won at least a silver medal in the 1500m at every World Championships since 2015

Tuesday is day four of the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

There's British interest in three events, with 2023 World Championship bronze medallist Ben Pattison, Max Burgin and Tiarnan Crorken up first in the men's 800m heats. 

Yemi Mary John, Amber Anning and Victoria Ohuruogu are in action in the women's 400m semi-finals. 

In the men's 400m semi-finals, Olympic silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith will be keen to improve on his performance in the heats after only qualifying as a fastest loser. Charlie Dobson and Samuel Reardon are also eyeing spots in the final.

Medals are up for grabs in the men's high jump, men's hammer throw, men's 110m hurdles and the women's 1500m, where Kenya's Faith Kipyegon is searching for her fifth world gold.

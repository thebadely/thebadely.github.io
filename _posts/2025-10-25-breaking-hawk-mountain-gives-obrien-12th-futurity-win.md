According to new developments, Hawk Mountain is the first Aidan O'Brien-trained horse to win the Futurity Trophy Stakes since Auguste Rodin in 2022 

Hawk Mountain gave Aidan O'Brien a record-extending 12th victory in the Futurity Trophy Stakes at Doncaster in what was the final Group One race of the British Flat season.

The first three finishers in the five-strong field were O'Brien horses, with the Irish trainer claiming his 23rd Group One winner of 2025. 

His most fancied horse - 7-4 favourite Benvenuto Cellini - fell away in the closing stages, leaving 18-5 Hawk Mountain to go neck and neck with 3-1 chance Action to finish. 

A final burst gave Hawk Mountain, ridden by Ronan Whelan, victory by half a length and boosted his chances for next year's Derby at Epsom. 

"We thought he was a classy horse and next year we thought he could be a Guineas horse as well as a Derby horse," O'Brien told ITV Sport.

"So he has class and Ronan gave him a lovely ride.

"He's a big, powerful, strong horse with an unbelievable mind. So yes, delighted."

Here’s what you need to know: The draw for the World Cup play-offs takes place on Thursday, and the results on Tuesday are crucial for Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and, potentially, Scotland.

We know 10 of the 16 teams who will be in the play-offs, but who fills the remaining places will determine the draw pots - and who gets home advantage in the semi-finals.

Here's how the draw is shaping up, and how the four nations could be affected...

Wales need a victory over North Macedonia to secure a home semi-final in the World Cup play-offs

There are four places to be won, through four play-off paths each containing four teams with one-legged semi-finals and finals.

The draw takes place at 12:00 GMT on Thursday, which will create the individual paths.

In the semi-finals, the seeded teams will be at home: 

Pot 1 v Pot 4

Pot 2 v Pot 3

Each of the four paths will have one team from each pot, feeding into a final.

The home advantage in each of the finals will be determined by draw on Thursday.

So, is being in Pot 1 more favourable than Pot 2? It does not make too much difference apart from being kept away from the other Pot 1 teams in the paths.

While Pot 4 has teams who failed to make the top two of their World Cup groups, there are nations within it who will have a higher world ranking that some in Pot 3. 

The other argument is that the teams in Pot 3 have better recent form, so should be seen as stronger opponents.

What's most important is being in Pot 1 or Pot 2, and guaranteeing a home semi-final.

Albania, the Czech Republic, Italy, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and Ukraine are definitely in.

Kosovo and Turkey will be in barring huge victories against Switzerland and Spain respectively.

One of North Macedonia or Wales will feature, and most likely both.

The 12 teams who finished runners-up in their group will be seeded into three pots by their world ranking. The fourth pot will contain the four teams who were awarded a play-off through performance in the Uefa Nations League.

So, what do we know for certain? Not too much yet.

Pot 1: Italy

Pot 2: Slovakia

Pot 3: Albania, plus Kosovo unless they beat Switzerland by six goals.

Pot 4: Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland

Turkey and Ukraine are likely to be Pot 1.

Scotland will qualify automatically with a victory over Denmark on Tuesday. If they fail to get the win, they will be in the play-offs.

The Scots cannot be in Pot 1, but are looking good for Pot 2 and that home semi-final. A draw would secure Pot 2.

However, there is one plausible sets of results which would put Scotland in Pot 3 and lead to an away semi-final:

Scotland lose

Bosnia win in Austria

Wales win at home against North Macedonia

Tears of joy as Irish keep World Cup dream alive

Italy fighting to avoid another 'apocalyptic' World Cup failure

How Haaland fired Norway to the World Cup

Wales are guaranteed at least a play-off, and could technically still qualify automatically if they were to win and Belgium lost at home to Liechtenstein.

Really, it's just a question of which play-off pot they will be in. If they lose or draw at home to North Macedonia, they will be in Pot 4 as a Uefa Nations League group winner and be away to a Pot 1 team.

If Wales win they are guaranteed to be in Pot 2 and will get a home semi-final against a team from Pot 3.

So far, only Albania are certain of Pot 3.

The Republic of Ireland's stunning late win in Hungary on Sunday gave them an unlikely play-off route.

It's most probable they will be in Pot 3 for the draw, but there is a chance of being in Pot 2 and getting that home semi-final.

To get into Pot 2, the Republic of Ireland need both these results, which are not beyond the realms of possibility:

Bosnia draw or lose in Austria

North Macedonia win or draw in Wales

As we know for certain that Northern Ireland will be in Pot 4 and away from home in the semi-finals, it's just a question of waiting to see their potential opponents. Only Italy are confirmed as being in Pot 1.

These are the play-offs in March which set out the final two places and don't involve any countries from Europe. The draw also takes place on Thursday.

Six nations will take part, in two paths with a semi-final and a final.

However, world ranking is even more important as the two countries with the best ranking go direct to the final.

Asia: Iraq or United Arab Emirates

Africa: DR Congo

Concacaf: Two places TBC

Conmebol: Bolivia

OFC: New Caledonia

All we know for certain is that Bolivia and New Caledonia will be in the semi-finals. 

The range of world rankings which could take up the two Concacaf slots is from 31 to 126 and who slots into those (the final matches are overnight into Wednesday) will determine the two top seeds.

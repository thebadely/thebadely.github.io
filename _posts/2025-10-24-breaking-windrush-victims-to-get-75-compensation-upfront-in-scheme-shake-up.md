According to new developments, Victims of the Windrush Scandal will get 75% of their compensation in advance, as part of changes to the government scheme.

The Home Office said applicants aged 75 and over, as well as those with serious health conditions, will be prioritised - in a effort to ensure speedier justice.

For the first time, victims will also be compensated for lost contributions to pensions, as well as any immigration fees they have had to pay.

The Windrush Compensation scheme - which was set up in 2019 - has faced intense criticism from campaigners and legal experts for ongoing processing delays, low offers and unfair rejections.

The scandal first came to light in 2018 after it was revealed that the Home Office had failed to keep records of people with indefinite leave to remain in the UK - and had not issued paperwork needed to confirm their legal status.

Thousands of Caribbean migrants who came to the UK between 1948 to 1973 and had the right to remain, were wrongly classified as illegal citizens and denied access to homes, jobs and NHS care. 

Many others were threatened with or faced detention and deportation.

Official figures published last month showed that so far just over £116m had been paid in compensation since the scheme's launch.

But 15,000 people were thought to be eligible when it was set up.

In June, a damning report suggested that two-thirds of Windrush claimants had not received any compensation at all.

Others have received significantly less than they might be entitled to due to lack of legal assistance, the report says. One woman previously told the BBC her father had been offered just £400.

Under the new rules, victims who have appealed the government's offer will receive an advance payment of three quarters of the amount, while they wait for their review to be completed.

"It is unacceptable that many victims are still waiting for compensation all these years later. That changes today," said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Friday.

Describing the scandal as a "shameful stain on our history", Mahmood added: "I will leave no stone unturned until everyone affected receives the justice they deserve."

In June, the government announced the first Windrush Commissioner, Reverend Clive Foster, who is responsible for speaking up for victims and looking at ways to improve the compensation scheme.

Last month, he wrote to the government about why victims with the scheme, saying there was a perception that "the Home Office is waiting for us to die off".

He added he did not feel himself this was the case, but wanted to reflect victims' views.

Speaking after the announcement, Mr Foster said the changes will "make a real difference, especially for those who don't have time on their side."

But he warned rolling out the changes must be "swift and sustained," adding "trust will only be rebuilt through action, and I will continue to press for progress on all my outstanding recommendations".

The changes were announced by the Migration and Citizenship Minister Mike Tapp, who spoke at the Windrush National Organisation conference in Birmingham.

Windrush is one of the few major state schemes that does not provide legal assistance and the Home Office has so far rejected calls for it to be introduced.

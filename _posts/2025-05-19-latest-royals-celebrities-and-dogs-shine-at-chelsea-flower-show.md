Here’s what you need to know: The Chelsea Flower show opened its gates to royalty and celebrities on Monday, with dogs, unusually, taking the spotlight. 

King Charles III and Queen Camilla were among the first to tour the gardens on display, being joined by famous figures like football icon David Beckham and actress Cate Blanchett. 

This year's event favours rewilding and sustainability, with mossy paving, native planting and gravel paths. 

Designers leaned into natural landscapes shaped by climate change and a growing desire to reconnect with nature.

But it was not just the planting that got people talking. The RHS and BBC Radio 2 Dog Garden, created by Monty Don, gave four-legged visitors rare top billing.

Created with canine comfort in mind, it features dog-friendly lawns, water for wallowing and shade-providing trees. Names of royal and broadcaster-owned dogs are etched into brick paths – including the late Beth, the Queen's Jack Russell, her new puppy Moley and the King's dog Snuff.

Don, not usually a fan of show gardens, said the chance to celebrate the dog-owner bond had won him over. 

The garden will not be judged and will not stay. After Chelsea, it will find a permanent home at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home.

Along with Beckham and Blanchett, Dame Joanna Lumley and actor David Tennant were among those getting a preview of the world-famous event, along with BBC presenter Zoe Ball.

Scorecard

Tim David hit the fastest T20 International century by an Australian as they beat the West Indies to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in their five-match series.

The batter hit 11 sixes and six fours as he ended 102 not out off 37 deliveries, with Australia cruising to a six-wicket victory at Warner Park in Basseterre, Saint Kitts.

Josh Inglis held the previous record, with his century against Scotland in 2024 coming off 43 balls.

"I was just having a great time. I didn't think I would get the opportunity to get a hundred for Australia so I'm stoked," said David, who has previously played for Singapore and made his Australia debut in 2022.

"The pitch was good and small boundaries so you have to back your strengths. Warner Park is a great place to bat and it was great to have experience here in the CPL (Caribbean Premier League).

"I've spent a lot of time working on power hitting but now I'm working on my shot selection."

Australia won the toss and put the West Indies into bat, but the hosts made a strong start. Shai Hope and Brandon King put together a 125-run opening stand in 11.4 overs, with captain Hope recording an unbeaten 102 off 57 balls.

The West Indies continued to score at more than 10 runs an over as they posted 214-4.

Australia's reply initially stuttered as they found themselves 61-3 after 5.5 overs, but David's century saw his team surge to victory with 23 balls to spare.

"There are no words for that innings from David," said Australia captain Mitchell Marsh.

It is the joint third fastest T20I century in a match between sides who are full members of the International Cricket Council.

David Millar bludgeoned a 35-ball century for South Africa against Bangladesh in 2017, a feat matched by Rohit Sharma for India against Sri Lanka later that year.

David's effort matches that of Abhishek Sharma for India against England in February 2025.

The fastest T20I is Sahil Chauhan's 27-ball effort for Estonia against Cyprus in 2024.

Australia won the first T20 by three wickets and second by eight wickets.

The fourth match is scheduled to begin at 00:00 BST on Sunday (19:00 local time on Saturday).

According to new developments, Elisa Longo Borghini topped the general classification by 18 seconds to win her second straight Women's Giro d'Italia

Home favourite Elisa Longo Borghini said she was "lost for words" after winning the Women's Giro d'Italia for the second year running.

The Italian, riding for UAE Team ADQ, finished fourth on the final stage to secure the pink jersey.

Having only taken the race lead on the penultimate stage, Longo Borghini was 18 seconds clear of nearest challenger Marlen Reusser of Movistar in the general classification.

Australian Sarah Gigante of AG Insurance-Soudal Team completed the podium.

"I'm lost for words. This Giro was intense, packed with emotions, unforgettable," said Longo Borghini.

"I knew I was going to have to give everything and that's what I did. Cycling is full of highs and lows, and moments like this make the sacrifice worthwhile."

Liane Lippert, also of Movistar, won the extremely hilly 134km eighth and final stage from Forli to Imola.

The German beat SD Worx-Protime's Anna van der Breggen in a two-up sprint finish.

Although Reusser got ahead of Longo Borghini for third, the four-second time bonus was not enough for the Swiss rider.

Here’s what you need to know: BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness have resigned, after a newspaper report suggested a BBC Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by US President Donald Trump.

They announced their resignations in separate emails to all BBC staff, at 18:00.

The BBC's chair Samir Shah also released a statement.

Here are their statements in full:

Dear all

I wanted to let you know that I have decided to leave the BBC after 20 years. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the chair and board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure including during recent days.

I am working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.

I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.

In these increasingly polarised times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us. It helps make the UK a special place; overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious. Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.

Our organisation is a critical ingredient of a healthy society, as well as a thriving creative sector. We should champion it, not weaponise it.

Despite a hugely competitive market, I am proud that the BBC remains the most trusted news brand globally. We have continued to ensure that it is used by almost everyone in the UK as well as hundreds of millions of people globally. Despite the inevitable issues and challenges, our journalism and quality content continues to be admired as a gold standard. Our transition to a digital organisation has been deeply impressive, and our thriving commercial businesses are admired globally. Also, our work together on ensuring that we have the right culture has been important and motivating. I could not be more impressed by what you are achieving.

You will ask why now, why this moment?

I am BBC through and through, having spent the last 20 years of my life working for this organisation as director of marketing, communications and audiences, director of audio and music, acting director general and chief executive of BBC Studios. I care deeply about it and want it to succeed. That is why I want to create the best conditions and space for a new DG to come in and positively shape the next Royal Charter. I hope that as we move forward, a sensible, calm and rational public conversation can take place about the next chapter of the BBC.

This timing allows a new DG to help shape the next charter. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver growth.

Thank you again, it has been a wonderful ride, which I have loved. I count myself very lucky to have served as DG no.17. I will have a proper chance to see many of you before I go but I have been incredibly proud to lead the BBC as DG for over five years. It is a precious UK institution and you are a world-class team. Thank you all for the tireless support and friendship.

I will always be a passionate cheerleader for civilised society, a strong BBC and a thriving UK.

Best wishes,

Tim

Dear all,

I have never been more proud of the work that you do every day. You really are the best of the best.

I have taken the difficult decision that it will no longer be my role to lead you in the collective vision that we all have: to pursue the truth with no agenda.

The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.

As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me - and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the Director-General last night.

In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.

In a polarised world, BBC News journalism is more vital than ever, and I could not be prouder of the work that you do. Together we have bucked the global trend, to grow trust in BBC News, and I want to thank you, wherever you are in the world, for your courageous work to deliver that.

My plea to you: please keep the courage to continue our mission. I'm only sorry that I won't be there to lead and champion your brilliant journalism.

It has been a great privilege to work with you all.

I will now work with Tim to plan an orderly handover to ensure that my decision to step away causes the least disruption possible to the important work that you do.

With very best wishes,

Deborah

Dear all,

I write to you all on a very difficult day, following the news that our director general Tim Davie will be stepping down. The CEO of News Deborah Turness has also resigned.

On behalf of the BBC Board I want to extend my sincere gratitude to both of them for their unwavering service and commitment to the BBC.

This is a sad day for the BBC. Tim has been an outstanding director general for the last five years. He has propelled the BBC forward with determination, single-mindedness and foresight.

He has had the full support of me and the board throughout. However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.

Tim has given 20 years of his life to the BBC. He is a devoted and inspirational leader and an absolute believer in the BBC and public service broadcasting. He has achieved a great deal. Foremost, under his tenure, the transformation of the BBC to meet the challenges in a world of unprecedented change and competition is well underway.

Personally, I will miss his stamina, good humour and resilience and I will miss working with him. I wish him and his family the very best for the future.

I also want to thank Deborah for her leadership of BBC News over the past three years. She has transformed the operation of News with real commitment and a clear vision of the future.

She has acted with integrity in challenging circumstances and leaves a strong legacy from which to build for the many millions around the world who rely on and trust the voice of BBC News every day.

Tim has also asked me to pass on the following words in relation to Deborah's resignation. He says: "In the past three years, Deborah has led the newsroom with extraordinary energy, changing the way that it works and cementing BBC News as the most used and trusted news outlet in the UK and the most trusted news provider internationally.

"She has been a valued colleague and a passionate advocate for her team of more than 5,000 people who work round the clock and around the world, on and off air, to report without fear or favour in an age where press freedom has never been under greater pressure. Deborah offered her resignation to me last night, and I want to thank her for all that she has done and to wish her the very best for her future."

I fully understand this has been a difficult period for everyone connected to the BBC and it goes without saying this is an incredibly important time for the organisation.

On behalf of the board, I want to assure you all that we will do everything we can to ensure a smooth transition as we appoint Tim's successor. We will continue to work with Tim in this interim period.

In terms of News, Deborah has agreed to support the organisation to work through an orderly handover.

I fully understand this is unsettling for all of us, but I remain resolute that the BBC will continue to deliver world class public service broadcasting in the days, weeks and months ahead.

I will be back in touch to update you all as soon as possible.

Thank you,

Samir Shah

Experts revealed that Matteo Franzoso made 17 World Cup starts across downhill and super-G events

Italian skier Matteo Franzoso has died following a training crash in Chile on Saturday.

He had been placed in a medically induced coma in a Santiago hospital after suffering a head injury in a collision with a fence in La Parva.

Franzoso, who would have celebrated his 26th birthday on Tuesday, made his World Cup debut in December 2021.

He made 17 World Cup starts, with his best performance a 28th-place finish in the super-G at Cortina d'Ampezzo in northern Italy in 2023.

"This is a tragedy for his family and for our sport," said Italian winter sports federation (FISI) president Flavio Roda.

Franzoso's death comes almost a year after Italian junior champion and Europa Cup racer Matilde Lorenzi died after a fall at the Italian ski resort of Val Senales.

"It is absolutely necessary to do everything possible so that such incidents are not repeated," Roda added.

The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) said it was "deeply saddened" by Franzoso's death.

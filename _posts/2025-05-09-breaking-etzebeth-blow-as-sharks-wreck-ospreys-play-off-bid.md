Experts revealed that Sharks secured home advantage in the URC quarter-finals

United Rugby Championship

Sharks (14) 29

Tries: Jenkins, Esterhuizen, Hooker, Buthelezi Cons: Masuku 2, Fassi Pen: Masuku

Ospreys (3) 10

Try: Parry Con: Edwards Pen: Edwards

Ospreys' play-off hopes in the United Rugby Championship (URC) are all but over following defeat by Sharks.

The South African side scored two tries apiece in each half to claim a scrappy victory in Durban.

Sam Parry stepped off the bench to grab his fifth try of the season in a gutsy but limited display by the visitors at Kings Park.

Ospreys' season could be ended by other results this weekend before next week's climax at Lions.

Sharks' bonus-point win secured home advantage in the quarter-finals but was tainted by a knee injury for Eben Etzebeth who left the pitch on the back of a medical buggy.

Ospreys head coach Mark Jones made just one change to the team that thrashed Dragons for this must-win game but a star-studded Sharks were a distinctly different prospect.

The hosts led 14-3 at half-time through their aerial dominance and sheer brute force - but Ospreys had their chances.

Lock Jason Jenkins was hard to stop from close range, while centre Andre Esterhuizen proved similarly unstoppable from a few metres more.

Ironically it was a dropped ball that dislodged a solid Ospreys defence as well as a wonderfully delayed pass by Jaden Hendrikse.

The scrum-half would prove Sharks' match-winner.

Ospreys had their moments between those tries but Kieran Hardy's sublime solo effort was ruled out for a fumble over the line, Dewi Lake was denied in the corner, while breaks by Morgan Morse and Dan Kasende went unfinished.

Adam Beard played his 100th league game while Jac Morgan made 50th regional appearance - a day after being named in the British and Irish Lions squad.

The Wales captain was utterly impressive once again despite another loss - perhaps even more so because of it - keeping Sharks at bay almost single-handedly, leading the match for both turnovers and tackles.

But Keelan Giles failed to gather Henrikse's speculative kick to hand wing Ethan Hooker an easy finish.

Ospreys struggled to negotiate the Sharks' blitz defence until replacement hooker Parry finished a line-out drive.

And as the game broke apart as Ospreys chased more points, Phepsi Buthelezi latched on to a catch and offload by Makazole Mapimpi to clinch a bonus-point success.

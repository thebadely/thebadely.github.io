It has been recently reported that Andreas Schjelderup has eight Norway caps

Norway international Andreas Schjelderup has been given a two-week suspended prison sentence after a Danish court found him guilty of sharing sexual material of two boys under the age of 18.

Benfica winger Schjelderup, 21, told the court he received a 27-second video on Snapchat and forwarded it to a group chat of four friends before deleting it once he realised its content.

Schjelderup, who was 19 and playing for Danish Superliga side Nordsjaelland at the time of the incident, pleaded guilty after co-operating with a police investigation.

Schjelderup will only have to serve time in jail if found guilty of another crime during the next 12 months.

The prosecution had asked the court to sentence Schjelderup to at least 20 days in prison.

His lawyer Anders Nemeth told the court that the defence would take time to deliberate before deciding whether to appeal.

Rui Costa, president of Portuguese side Benfica, has previously been reported as saying the club will support Schjelderup.

In a statement posted on Instagram on 8 November, Schjelderup apologised and said he wanted to "be open to all of you about a stupid mistake I did".

He said he was "ready to face the consequences" and urged people not to "watch or spread videos with harmful or offensive content".

"The offence I will be convicted for does not reflect on who I am as a person and what I stand for," he added.

Schjelderup, who has eight caps for Norway, was an unused substitute on Sunday as they beat Italy 4-1 in Milan to qualify for the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

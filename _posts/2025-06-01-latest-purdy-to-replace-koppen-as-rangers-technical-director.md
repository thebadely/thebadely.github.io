It has been recently reported that Nils Koppen is leaving Rangers after 17 months

Rangers' new American owners are continuing their restructuring of the club by appointing Everton's former head of recruitment Dan Purdy as technical director to replace Nils Koppen.

Last week, a US-based consortium, including the investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers, completed a multi-million pound takeover of Rangers.

New sporting director Kevin Thelwell officially begins his role on Monday, and the club have moved to bring in Purdy to work alongside him, as they did at Everton.

Koppen, previously head of scouting for Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, originally joined Rangers as director of football recruitment in January 2024 before the Belgian stepped up to become technical director 10 months later. 

Now the club's new owners have decided to move in a different direction, though Koppen will assist Thelwell with the transition into his new role.

The Ibrox club are expected to appoint a new head coach soon, with Davide Ancelotti and Russell Martin believed to be the two main candidates.

Andrew Cavenagh will be confirmed as the club's new chairman at an annual meeting at the end of June. His vice-chair will be the current chairman of Leeds United, Paraag Marathe. Patrick Stewart will continue as chief executive.

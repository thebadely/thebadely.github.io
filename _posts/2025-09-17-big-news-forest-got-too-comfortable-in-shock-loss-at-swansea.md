According to new developments, Nottingham Forest have not won the League Cup since 1990

Ange Postecoglou says his Nottingham Forest players got too "comfortable" after Championship side Swansea scored twice in stoppage time to knock them out of the Carabao Cup.

Two first-half goals from Igor Jesus had put the Premier League side firmly in control of their third-round tie. 

However, a Cameron Burgess goal gave the Swans hope and, in a stunning finale, Zan Vipotnik levelled before Australia international Burgess scored his second to send the 2013 winners into the last 16.

"We had to finish them off and we had plenty of opportunities to do that, and a couple of decisions didn't go our way," said Forest boss Postecoglou.

"I think the lads got a bit comfortable in that moment and you've got to know the warning signs.

"Players just thought it would naturally finish that way and we've paid a heavy price for that. We need to improve."

The former Spurs boss had promised this would be the night fans started to see his imprint on the side he inherited from Nuno Espirito Santo at the City Ground.

Instead, Forest conceded three for a second game in a row under Postecoglou, who added: "Tonight was a great opportunity for us to progress in a cup and give ourselves an opportunity to that success - and to let it slip is hugely disappointing.

"But it doesn't change anything - we understand some of the things we have to work on."

Forest showed signs of playing the brand of football associated with Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham in the summer despite guiding them to Europa League success last term. 

But Swansea's late show denied even the chance of penalties, with Postecoglou adding: "We should have seen it out better than we did.

"You can look at positives with some of the performances, but ultimately the overriding factor is that we're out of cup competition when we really should have progressed.

"There were some promising performances but all that fades away when you realise we missed an opportunity to progress."

Asked if he felt frustration that the upset would keep him in focus before Saturday's Premier League trip to Burnley, Postecoglou added: "That's OK, it's not about me, it's about the club. It's about us progressing and creating an environment where we can have real success."

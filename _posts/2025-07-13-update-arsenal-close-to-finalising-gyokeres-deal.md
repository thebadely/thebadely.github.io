Here’s what you need to know: Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 matches for Sporting

Arsenal expect to reach a full agreement with Sporting inside the next 24 hours for the 73.5m euros (Â£63.5m) signing of Viktor Gyokeres.

Sources have told BBC Sport that a club-to-club deal for the Sweden forward is now in place with just minor details left to resolve.

All parties are working towards the signing being completed in time for Gyokeres to travel with the Gunners to Asia for their pre-season tour at the end of the week.

The offer, inclusive of add-ons, is an improvement on Arsenal's previous proposal of 70m euros (Â£60m).

Gyokeres, 27, has already agreed terms on a five-year deal.

BBC Sport revealed at the start of the month how Arsenal had turned their attentions to Gyokeres after hitting an impasse in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.

Gunners sporting director Andrea Berta flew to Lisbon towards the end of last week to lead negotiations with Sporting.

Arsenal target Gyokeres faces Sporting disciplinary action

Brighton flop to hot property - is Arsenal target Gyokeres ready?

This weekend, Sporting's president Frederico Varandas said Gyokeres was facing disciplinary action after failing to report for pre-season training.

Gyokeres, who scored 54 goals in 52 games last season, has yet to publicly explain why he has not turned up for pre-season.

Varandas told Portuguese news agency Lusa that "no one is above the interests of the club".

Former Brighton and Coventry striker Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 matches during his two seasons in Portugal, firing Sporting to two league titles.

Full leaderboard

Lottie Woad fell eight shots adrift of the lead at the Tournament of Champions as cold and blustery conditions in Orlando led to play being suspended on Saturday.

England's Woad, 22, who shared the lead with three-time major winner Lydia Ko after she carded 69 on day two on Friday, was three over for her third round through 16 holes as conditions worsened at the season-opening LPGA tournament at Lake Nona.

Olympic champion Ko, of New Zealand, also failed to complete her round and is five shots behind new leader Nelly Korda.

American Korda, who is looking for her first win since November 2024, fired an eight-under par 64 to take a three-stroke advantage over South Korea's Amy Yang.

However, Yang, her compatriot You-Min Hwang, who is level with Ko on eight under,  and Japan's Nasa Hataoka on five under were among the frontrunners who were halted by the high winds.

Canadian Brooke Henderson managed to move up the leaderboard after a round of 66, leaving her six shots away from Korda.

According to new developments, Nicholas Pooran was captain of the West Indies one-day team for a spell in 2022

Nicholas Pooran, one of the world's leading T20 batters, has retired from international duty with West Indies aged 29.

The Trinidadian has played 167 times for West Indies, but the decision will allow him to concentrate on playing in lucrative franchise leagues.

He had already skipped the ongoing T20 series against England to rest following his time playing for Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

He also has deals in Major League Cricket (MLC) and The Hundred this summer.

Cricket West Indies said, external: "We salute his achievements and thank him for the moments he has given fans across the region and beyond.

"We wish him all the very best in the next phase of his journey."

While Pooran is not the first player to retire from internationals in favour of franchise leagues - South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen did so last week - his decision is one of the most significant, given his age and profile.

West Indies captain Shai Hope was asked about Pooran's decision to skip the England series last week but said that decision would not impact his future selection.

It is understood Pooran told West Indies of his retirement on Monday.

He last played for West Indies in December 2024 in T20s against Bangladesh, but has not played an ODI since July 2023 and does not play Tests.

Pooran is the most capped West Indian in T20 internationals with 106, and the leading T20I run-scorer with 2,275.

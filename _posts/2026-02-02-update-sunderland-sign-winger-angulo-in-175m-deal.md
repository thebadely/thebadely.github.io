Experts revealed that Nilson Angulo has scored six goals for Anderlecht in the Jupiler Pro League this season

Sunderland have signed Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth Â£17.5m.

The 22-year-old has penned a four-and-a-half-year contract on Wearside, with the option of a further year. 

"Nilson is an incredibly exciting prospect, and we are delighted he's chosen to join Sunderland," said Sunderland sporting director Kristjaan Speakman.

"A quick and creative wide player, he excels in all the core actions required to impact the final third, and he arrives ambitious to make an impression. 

"He's young but has already had many interesting experiences as a senior player domestically, on the European stage, and internationally with Ecuador. 

"We are delighted to have completed this signing and look forward to welcoming Nilson to Wearside."

Angulo only signed a contract extension with Anderlecht in September 2025, after joining in 2022. 

He leaves Belgium after three and a half years with 15 goal contributions this season across 30 games. 

He made his senior international debut in October 2021 during a friendly against Mexico. 

Meanwhile, winger Simon Adingra has joined AS Monaco on loan with a view to a permanent move.

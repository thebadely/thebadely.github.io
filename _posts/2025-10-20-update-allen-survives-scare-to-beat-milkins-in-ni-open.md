According to new developments, Mark Allen won the English Open at Brentwood in September

Mark Allen emerged a 4-3 winner over Robert Milkins in a see-saw encounter to progress to the second round of the Northern Ireland Open.

Milkins led three times in the match but each time the world number eight responded to level and then compiled a 113 clearance in the final frame to advance to a meeting with Ben Woollaston.

Milkins took the opening frame with a break of 70 and after Allen replied the Englishman put together a run of 98 to move ahead again.

Allen won the fourth by a single point with a clearance after Milkins missed frame ball, then the players traded frames again to set up a decider.

Milkins made a 14 break before missing a red into a middle pocket and Allen's century ensured he got over the line.

The Northern Irishman won the English Open in September and is aiming for a third Northern Ireland Open success, having won his 'home' tournament back-to-back in 2021 and 2022.

Allen described his performance at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday as "like chalk and cheese".

"I missed a few shots that I shouldn't have and I should have been 3-1 down as Rob missed an easy one to go 3-1," Allen told BBC Sport NI.

"I made a really good clearance and that probably settled me down. I couldn't really finish a match any better than I finished and I'll take a lot of positives into the next round. I just need to start quicker."

Allen is generally happy with his form and the influence of new coach Chris Henry, who has been helping him this season.

"People are saying I'm having an up and down season but I've won a tournament and reached the semi-final of another big event in China [the Wuhan Open] so there is a lot to be positive about.

"Sure, there have been some bad performances but a lot of people on tour would bite your hand off for the season I've had so far.

"When you're winning and competing for events but still not happy with where your game is it's a good sign.

"I feel we still have plenty to work on but we're doing the right things on the practice table and I'm starting to do things better off it as well - getting back to the gym and trying to lose a bit of weight so all those things together should bear fruit."

Earlier on Monday, British Open winner and reigning Masters champion Shaun Murphy swept aside David Lilley 4-0 to continue his good form.

The world number nine, beaten by Mark Williams in the recent Xi'an Grand Prix final, compiled breaks of 73, 69, 115 and 67 in advancing to a second round meeting with Elliot Slessor, who edged out Fan Zhengyi 4-3.

World-ranked 13 Barry Hawkins defeated Zak Surety 4-0, Yuan Sijun beat Daniel Wells 4-1, Zhou Yuelong got the better of Dylan Emery 4-2 and the Republic of Ireland's Aaron Hill was a 4-1 victor over Lei Peifan to book a round-two encounter with Hawkins.

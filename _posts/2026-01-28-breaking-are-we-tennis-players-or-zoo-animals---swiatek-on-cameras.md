'I'm not a fan of the cameras' - Pegula and Swiatek say players need more privacy

Six-time major champion Iga Swiatek says players are being watched "like animals in the zoo" by behind-the-scenes cameras at the Australian Open.

Coco Gauff was captured smashing her racquet in a corridor in the players' area at Melbourne Park on Tuesday, leading the American to call for more privacy.

The Australian Open has shown footage from the players' zone in the bowels of Rod Laver Arena - which includes the gym, warm-up area and the corridor from the locker room - since 2019.

Camera access is more restricted at the other majors.

"Are we tennis players, or are we animals in the zoo where they are observed even when they poop?" said Poland's Swiatek, who lost in the quarter-finals on Wednesday.

Semi-finalist Jessica Pegula described the constant filming as an "invasion of privacy" that needs to be "cut back".

"You just feel like you're under a microscope constantly," the American added.

Tournament organisers Tennis Australia told BBC Sport the cameras are used to help create a "deeper connection" between fans and players. 

"Striking the right balance between showcasing the personalities and skills of the players, while ensuring their comfort and privacy is a priority," a statement read.

Pegula, who is member of the WTA players' council, says the issue will "be highlighted again" in post-tournament discussions with the Australian Open.  

"I saw online people were zooming in on players' phones and stuff like that. That's so unnecessary," Pegula said.

"The only time you're not being recorded is when you are going to shower and go to the bathroom.

"It seems to be worse here than maybe other years, so I think now it's going to definitely be talked about and highlighted again moving forward."

Asked whether she had ever approached organisers about it, Swiatek replied: "What's the point?"

World number one Aryna Sabalenka was previously captured destroying a racquet by a similar camera after losing the 2023 US Open final.

Tennis Australia said it "valued" feedback given by the players and wanted to "work collaboratively" with them.

Former world number one Andy Roddick previously said there should be a "zone" for players to "detonate" after tough defeats.

American fourth seed Amanda Anisimova admitted she felt conscious about the cameras following her defeat by Pegula in Wednesday's quarter-finals.

"I knew [they] were there, so I just kept my head down and went to the locker room," she said.

Anisimova did, however, point to the cameras also picking out "good moments" for fans to see.

Plenty of lighter moments have been caught over the years, including the likes of Swiatek, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer being asked for their ID passes - but Swiatek feels that too is intrusive.

"We're tennis players. We're meant to be watched on the court and in the press," Swiatek added.

"That's our job. It's not our job to be a meme when you forget your accreditation."

Many leaders in tennis are fully aware how it must adapt and thrive in an ever-competitive sports market.

Seeing other sports show a more human side to their athletes - with Formula 1 documentary Drive To Survive regularly heralded as the gold standard - has forced tennis to think more creatively.

Netflix's documentary series Break Point did not engage fans in the same way, but providing behind-the-scenes content at tournaments feels like an easy win to deepen connections with fans.

When the Australian Open became the first major to bring cameras into player areas in 2019, Djokovic described it as 'Big Brother'.

The reality television show has continued to grow - potentially, now, to tipping point.

It might be scaled back, given the frustrations of the players, but it will not disappear. Tennis needs the eyeballs.

The US Open has followed suit in recent years - unsurprising given the access-all-areas demands of the American audience across the NBA, MLB and NFL.

Providing fans with deep insight of locker room culture, and what it really takes to be among the world's best, is more crucial than ever.

Wimbledon and the French Open, known for upholding more traditional values, have so far resisted. But for how long?

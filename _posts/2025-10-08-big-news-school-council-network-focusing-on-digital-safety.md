Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Ministers and school representatives are set to meet later for the first School Council Network in Jersey of the new term. 

The meetings, which take place up to six times a year, allow primary and secondary school councils to shape policy directly with government. 

The Department for Children, Young People, Education and Skills (CYPES) said the opening event of the term would focus on safety and digital wellbeing. 

Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Rob Ward congratulated all the students elected to their school councils, calling it "a big responsibility but also a fantastic opportunity".

Ward, who is set to attend the event alongside Minister for Children and Families Richard Vibert and Assistant Minister for Children and Families Malcom Ferey, said: "I'm excited to see the ideas and leadership you'll bring, and I look forward to working with you through the School Council Network."

Vibert said the network had grown into a "powerful, student-led forum".

"I'm proud to support a network that puts young voices at the heart of decision-making, and I look forward to hearing more from them as they focus on safety, which is one of our priorities in the Children, Young People and Families Plan," he added.

Students will also review Jersey's new Play Plan, ensuring it reflects their current needs and experiences.

CYPES said students last term helped redesign the Millennium Town Park playground, tested and tasted hot school meals, and submitted hundreds of questions to ministers.

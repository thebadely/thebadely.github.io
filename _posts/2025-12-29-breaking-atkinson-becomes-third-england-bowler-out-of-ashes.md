It has been recently reported that Gus Atkinson ended with six wickets from three Tests in his first Ashes series

Gus Atkinson has become the third England pace bowler to be ruled out of the Ashes series after confirmation he will miss the final Test against Australia in Sydney.

Atkinson suffered an injury to his left hamstring on the second and final morning of England's win in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

The tourists will not call up a replacement, leaving Matthew Potts in line to play in the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday (23:30 GMT on Saturday).

Atkinson joins Mark Wood and Jofra Archer in failing to complete the series because of injuries. All three were in England's first-choice XI for the first Test in Perth.

Wood has not played since Perth because of a knee issue, while Archer was ruled out after three Tests because of a side strain.

Surrey's Atkinson struggled in the first two Tests, managing only three wickets, and was subsequently left out of the third.

The 27-year-old looked nearer his best when he was recalled for the fourth Test, taking three wickets and making 28 with the bat in England's first innings.

He grabbed his left hamstring at the end of the fourth over of his spell on the second morning and immediately left the field. Atkinson played no further part as England completed a four-wicket win later the same day.

There is no confirmation on when he will return to the UK, at which point he will be assessed further. Earlier this year Atkinson spent two months out with an injury to his right hamstring.

Atkinson's absence leaves Durham's Potts in line to add his to his 10 Test caps and make an Ashes debut.

The 27-year-old has not played a Test match since the defeat by New Zealand in Hamilton last December.

A regular in the first summer of the Ben Stokes-Brendon McCullum era, Potts has made sporadic appearances over the past two years. His previous seven caps have come against six different opponents.

While England will definitely make one change for the series finale, Australia will also ponder alterations to their side after surrendering an 18-match unbeaten streak in home Ashes Tests.

Spinner Todd Murphy could come in for a pace bowler at the Sydney Cricket Ground, while all-rounder Cameron Green is under pressure after a lean spell with the bat.

As Australia held an optional training session in Melbourne on Monday, head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed batter Usman Khawaja will play in Sydney for what could be his last Test.

The left-hander turned 39 earlier this month and Australia do not play another Test until August.

However, McDonald said there has been "no indication" Khawaja is set to call time on his Test career.

"We've been really clear that we haven't had a conversation," said McDonald. "The speculation has been from external."

The final day of the Sydney Test is scheduled for 8 January and after such a gruelling tour, England are then due to begin a white-ball tour of Sri Lanka just two weeks later on 22 January.

The three one-day internationals and T20s are part of the preparation for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in February and March.

England will name their squads on Tuesday and are likely to be close to full-strength, with multi-format players not expected to be rested despite their involvement in the Ashes.

There will be a question over the availability of Archer, who could be named in the World Cup squad and assessed nearer the tournament.

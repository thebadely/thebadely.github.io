Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Louis Rees-Zammit has played 32 internationals for Wales

Wales wing Louis Rees-Zammit hopes to be fit for the opening autumn game against Argentina on Sunday, 9 November.

The British and Irish Lions back has not played international rugby for more than two years after making the switch to American football in January 2024.

Having signed a season-long deal at Bristol in August following his return to rugby union, Rees-Zammit was named in Steve Tandy's first Wales squad, despite suffering a toe injury in early October.

The 24-year-old trained separately with fellow wing Rio Dyer and Ospreys lock Rhys Davies in front of 6,000 fans at an open session at the Principality Stadium today.

"My foot is feeling good," Rees-Zammit told the Principality Stadium crowd.

"I have just been running the past couple of days and trying to get it ready for next week, but it is looking positive."

Rees-Zammit joined the Kansas City Chiefs and then the Jacksonville Jaguars, but did not play a competitive game in the NFL.

"It feels amazing to be back in rugby," added Rees-Zammit.

"I went out there and tried it out but I am happy to be back. It is great to see all the boys again and there is a new coaching staff which is great.

"All the boys are loving it and we are ready to rip in. 

"This is the first time I have been on this field for 18 months and it feels weird. It is great to see so many fans support us because it means so much."

Rees-Zammit, Dyer and Davies underwent a series of running drills behind the Principality Stadium posts, while the main squad held a full public session.

Montpellier lock Adam Beard was not involved in the Wales training event in Cardiff because he had to return to his French club due to World Rugby regulations.

Uncapped Leicester number eight Olly Cracknell was an observer, while Dragons hooker Elliot Dee was training with the squad, but is not currently part of the 39-man party.

Wales are hoping to turn the Principality Stadium back into a home fortress, having not won an international in Cardiff for more than two years.

Since beating England in a World Cup warm-up match in August 2023, Wales have suffered nine straight Test defeats in Cardiff, with the record 18-match international losing run ending in Japan in July.

Wales face Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa in November, before home 2026 Six Nations matches against France, Scotland and Italy in a tournament where Wales previously won a home match in February 2022.    

"It has been a while [winning in Cardiff] but the boys love playing in front of our own supporters," said captain Jac Morgan.

"Playing at the Principality Stadium is massive for all of us, so to be back there and hopefully getting a victory in front of the fans is exciting."

How many fans that will be there to watch Wales this autumn remains to be seen with the current discontent surrounding the Welsh game.

There has been very little success on the field and disarray off the pitch in the past couple of years, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) now preparing to cut a men's professional side.

The Principality Stadium capacity is 74,500 meaning the four matches could attract 298,000 supporters in November.

A WRU statement read: "With more than 200,000 supporters expected to visit Cardiff over the four-match series, to match average attendances over the last 10 years, ticket sales are tracking well against targets for the Quilter Nations Series.

"Fans are keen to see Wales take on Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa on home turf.

"As you would expect, the All Blacks game is the best seller and Principality Stadium's best chance of a sell-out this autumn."

Experts revealed that Saracens prop Rhys Carre and Bristol wing Louis Rees-Zammit both play their club rugby in England

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v Argentina

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Sunday, 9 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

Wales believe returning prop Rhys Carre is ready to go straight into the starting side to face Argentina on Sunday, with wing Louis Rees-Zammit hoping he can prove his fitness to be named as a replacement.

Saracens loose-head Carre is being considered for his first start since 2023, with the 27-year-old having been recalled to the first squad of new head coach Steve Tandy.

Bristol wing Rees-Zammit is hoping to win his fitness battle and make his long-awaited Wales return.

The 24-year-old wing has not played Test rugby for more than two years after switching to American football.

Tandy will name his side on Friday morning for the first of four autumn internationals, with Japan, New Zealand and South Africa to follow.

Wales v Argentina - all you need to know

Carre has not played for his country since 2023 and was previously ineligible under the Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) selection policy because he has 20 caps, five short of the required number for those playing with clubs outside Wales.

But there are loopholes, as demonstrated when Wales selected Jarrod Evans in the Six Nations earlier this year.

The Harlequins fly-half has fewer than 25 caps but he was not given a reasonable offer to remain with former club Cardiff.

It seems the same applies to Carre, who left Cardiff last year to join Saracens for a second time.

Carre would have become available for the other home nations in 2026 because it will have been three years since he previously played for Wales.

Tandy says that situation did not contribute to his decision to recall the prop and he could place his faith in Carre, which would mean Nicky Smith being named on the bench.

"What is obvious is his [Carre's] ability around the field, his attacking presence, his carrying ability and his turn of pace for a big man," said Wales assistant coach Danny Wilson.

"Those have now been joined by, in the Premiership, his development at scrum time, where he's been tested.

"He's been a breath of fresh air since he's been in camp. He's been great to work with and I'm looking forward to seeing how he goes through this campaign."

Carre is in line to pack down in the front row alongside Ospreys hooker Dewi Lake and Cardiff prop Keiron Assiratti.

Adam Beard and Dafydd Jenkins are expected to return in the second row after missing the summer tour of Japan.

After helping the British and Irish Lions win the series against Australia, Wales captain Jac Morgan is set to come into the back row alongside Cardiff flanker Alex Mann and Dragons number eight Aaron Wainwright.

The likes of Gloucester lock Freddie Thomas and Scarlets number eight Taine Plumtree could offer impetus from the replacements bench. 

Rees-Zammit is battling to be back in a Wales squad for the first time since defeat to Argentina in the World Cup quarter-final in Marseille in October 2023.   

The wing had spells on the practice squads of the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars, but did not play a competitive game in the NFL and returned to rugby union in August when signing for Bristol.

He has not played since damaging a toe against Saracens on 4 October but will hope to be deemed fit to be in the match 23, with Scarlets duo Blair Murray and Tom Rogers, along with Cardiff wing Josh Adams favourite to form the starting back three.

After an injury ruled him out of the summer tour, Gloucester centre Max Llewellyn is in line to rekindle his 2025 Six Nations midfield partnership with Ben Thomas.

At half-back, fly-half Dan Edwards will be hoping to keep his place alongside Lions scrum-half Tomos Williams.

Cardiff fly-half Callum Sheedy will hope to make a first international appearance since 2022, if he is named as a replacement alongside Rees-Zammit.

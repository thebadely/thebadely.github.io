Wigan Warriors prepared for their crunch Super League showdown against leaders Hull KR with a comeback win at Warrington.

The Wire led the reigning champions 8-6 at half time but were undone by a combination of errors, vulnerability under the high ball and a relentless Wigan drive in the second period.

Three tries after the break for Matt Peet's side, answered with a late consolation for Jake Thewlis, saw them run out 24-18 winners.

Defeat put a dent in Warrington's play-off hopes after they failed to close the four-point gap to Wakefield Trinity in sixth.

Second-placed Wigan will still fancy their chances of overhauling Hull KR to the League Leaders' Shield with two points now separating the pair, although that could return to four if Rovers beat Castleford on Saturday.

Whatever the gap, there is no doubt the Robins will be travelling to meet a Wigan side who are finally beginning to locate top gear with the regular season coming to the boil.

Wigan were behind early after Josh Thewlis intercepted Jai Field's pass, running it 90 metres after a quarter of an hour as Warrington took the lead.

Brad O'Neill went over from close range to level before Marc Sneyd's boot sent Wigan in trailing after Wire elected to kick a penalty in front of goal with three minutes of the half remaining.

Warrington nearly extended their lead further shortly after when a flowing move through Jake Thewlis and Toby King was finished off by Joe Philbin only for the try to be ruled out for a forward final pass.

Yet in the second half it was all Wigan with Warrington - minus regular full-back Matt Dufty who was left out for disciplinary reasons after missing training - looking vulnerable under the high ball and nervous with a succession of basic handling errors.

Jack Garrimond got the ball rolling on Wigan's improved second-half showing, finishing a move with a kick and collect via Zach Eckersley. 

A second assist for Eckersley followed as he put in Liam Farrell before taking centre stage himself, capitalising on a knock-on from Warrington on 66 minutes.

Another error at the back by Warrington saw Kruise Leeming pounce to tee up Farrimond who added his second try in the right corner as Wigan stretched their lead to 24-12.

With time running out, the hosts briefly threatened to set up a grandstand finish as Jake Thewlis' try and Sneyd's nerveless kick brought them to within six points.

But in a move that summed up their night, a knock-on on the ground as they charged to the halfway line with seconds to spare brought the curtain down on the fightback.

Warrington coach Sam Burgess told BBC Radio Merseyside:

"There are areas in the game where our concentration doesn't seem to be there and I'm not talking for a split second.

"Sometimes effort is not enough â you need to be thinking for the whole game.

"They are a great side with great players and they took some moments against us. They turned it up in the last 20 minutes and we couldn't stay with them.

"We had our moments too but it is guys making tackles and keeping hold of the ball. We are just not being clinical enough.

"With Matt Dufty, the bottom line is he hurt the team and he has to fix his behaviour up. I will say he has been great through the week but we missed him tonight and that was his choice."

Burgess on play-off hopes: "It is tough for us from here, but it is not going to change anything I'm doing. Regardless of the scenarios, I want to see a team that looks more like us."

Wigan coach Matt Peet told BBC Radio Merseyside: 

"I am proud and I enjoyed the performance. There were a lot of positives to take out in terms of endeavour and will and defensive commitment.

"The margins of the game could have been greater, but it is always a tough place to come. I know they like to challenge Wigan and they've got some good players playing well so it's a good test."

Peet on going on to face Hull KR next week: "It is a performance we are proud of, but the quality has to improve.

"Respectfully, I am not bothered who the opposition is. We make the improvements we can and keep committing to each other and we will be tough to beat."

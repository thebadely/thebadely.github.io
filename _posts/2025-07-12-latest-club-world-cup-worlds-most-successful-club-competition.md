Let's dive into the details: Fifa president Gianni Infantino was speaking alongside footballing legends like Ronaldo Nazario, Roberto Baggio and Kaka at Trump Tower

Fifa president Gianni Infantino believes the Club World Cup is "already the most successful club competition in the world", despite "some negatives" surrounding the tournament.

Infantino, who has led world football's governing body since 2016, claims the competition has generated more than $2bn (Â£1.5bn) in revenue, which he says is worth "$33m (Â£24m) per match".

As a result, he believes the tournament has been a "huge success", adding "the golden era of global club football has started".

Infantino's words come just weeks after former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said the Club World Cup, which this year moved to the summer and expanded to 32 teams, was "the worst idea ever implemented in football".

Many matches have been poorly attended, with more than a million empty seats  during the tournament, while players like Jude Bellingham, Reece James and Enzo Fernandez have criticised the weather conditions and quality of the pitches in the United States.

Chelsea midfielder Fernandez said the heat was "very dangerous", while his manager Enzo Maresca complained it is "impossible" to have a normal training session.

Speaking at Trump Tower in New York on the eve of Sunday's final between Chelsea and Paris St-Germain (20:00 BST), Infantino said: "The golden era of global club football has started. 

"We can say definitely that this Fifa Club World Cup has been a huge, huge, huge success. Of course, there are a lot of positives, some negatives. 

"We respect everyone's opinion. It has been successful. We have had over 2.5 million in the stadium. That's around 40,000 spectators per match - there is no league in the world with that number, except the Premier League which, of course, has home teams and these are neutral stadiums.

"We heard financially it would not work but I can say we generated over $2bn in revenues with this competition. We earned on average $33m per match. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33m per match. 

"It is already the most successful club competition in the world with all different measurements."

How have global football fans embraced Club World Cup?

'Fifa should consider playing World Cup final at 9am'

Has run to Club World Cup final been worth it for Chelsea?

In New Jersey, where Sunday's final - set to be attended by US President Donald Trump - will take place, temperatures have reached 38C in recent days.

Infantino accepted the high summer temperatures in the US are "definitely an issue" after Fernandez called on Fifa to consider player welfare before next summer's 2026 World Cup.

Earlier this month, players' union Fifpro said it believed Chelsea's game against ES Tunis in Philadelphia, among others, should have been delayed or postponed because of the heat.

The World Cup is due to take place in the US, Canada and Mexico over the same period next year.

"Of course, the heat is definitely an issue," said Infantino. "It's an issue around the world. I remember it was the same in the Olympics in Paris and in other football games. 

"The conditions need cooling breaks, watering the pitch and seeing how we can do things better. But we have stadiums in America that are covered and one in Canada in Vancouver which is covered, and we will definitely use these stadiums more during the day."

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium was the only covered stadium at the Club World Cup but the 2026 World Cup will have a further four options with roofs - Vancouver, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles.

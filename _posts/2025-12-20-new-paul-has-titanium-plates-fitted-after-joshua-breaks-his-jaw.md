Experts revealed that Jake Paul was stopped for the first time in his boxing career

Jake Paul has had two titanium plates fitted and some teeth removed after Anthony Joshua broke his jaw in two places during the American's stoppage defeat in their heavyweight fight in Miami.

The 28-year-old went six rounds with two-time world heavyweight champion Joshua, but the fight was stopped when Paul failed to beat the count following repeated knockdowns.

The YouTuber-turned-boxer hit the canvas twice in the fifth and sixth rounds and said in his post-fight comments he thought his jaw was "definitely" broken.

"Surgery went well thanks for all the love and support," wrote Paul on Instagram. "Have to have only liquids for seven days."

Paul posted an image of his X-ray on social media that showed the double break, external on his jawline.

Despite missing the post-fight news conference as a result of the injury, Paul joked he could take on former four-weight world champion Saul Canelo Alvarez "in 10 days".

"A broken jaw is very common in sports, particularly in boxing or MMA," Most Valuable Promotions chief Nakisa Bidarian said. "The recovery time is four to six weeks."

Paul was a massive underdog against his vastly more experienced opponent and he tried to use his speed and footwork to stay away from the Briton's big punches.

The fight had attracted criticism because of the weight discrepancy and experience gap between the fighters.

Paul has fought most of his career at cruiserweight and says he intends to take "some time off" from boxing.

"We will heal the broken jaw, come back and fight people my weight. I'm going for the cruiserweight world title," he said.

"I'm going to take a little break. I've been going hard for six years."

Paul has made a career out of being impossible to predict - with the one constant his eagerness to disrupt the sport.

Just a few months ago, the prospect of Paul facing Joshua seemed fanciful, but he has now ticked that off his wishlist.

Prior to facing Joshua, Paul was campaigning at cruiserweight and the WBA announced he would enter their rankings at number 14 in July.

He has since slipped down one place, so a return to that division would appear most logical if he is to eventually achieve his dream of fighting for a world title.

Bidarian said Paul "drove himself to hospital" jaw after losing to Joshua and could need "four to six weeks" to recover.

Once Paul gets the green light to compete in 2026 he might begin to cast his eye at those above him in the WBA cruiserweight rankings - and one name that stands out is Manchester's Pat Brown.

Brown is undefeated in five fights as a professional and could jump at the chance to fight on a big stage and enhance his reputation.

Alternatively, Paul continued to express a desire to face Alvarez and will no doubt continue to pursue one of the biggest names still active in the sport.

A rematch with Tommy Fury - the only other defeat on Paul's record - also still lingers.

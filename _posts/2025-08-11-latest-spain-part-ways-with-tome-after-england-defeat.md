According to new developments, Spain won 28 of Montse Tome's 37 games in charge

Spain's women's national team have parted ways with head coach Montse Tome and named Sonia Bermudez as her replacement. 

The Spanish Football Federation said Tome's contract will not be renewed when it expires on 31 August. 

Tome, 43, became Spain's first female head coach when she was appointed in September 2023, having acted as Jorge Vilda's assistant until the 44-year-old was sacked amid the Luis Rubiales scandal. 

She led the side to victory in the inaugural Women's Nations League in February 2024, but Spain finished runners-up in the Euros after a penalty shootout defeat by England on 27 July. 

The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) thanked Tome for "her work, professionalism and dedication" but said she will leave her role on 31 August when her deal expires. 

Bermudez won nine league titles during a playing career that took her to Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Levante. 

The 40-year-old played 61 times for Spain and had been head coach of the U23s until her promotion to the senior side. 

She captained Spain and competed in the 2015 World Cup, when La Roja finished bottom of their group. 

Tome knew her time in charge was likely to end going into Euro 2025, with her contract due to expire this summer and no apparent desire to offer an extension.

Women's football director Reyes Bellver joined the RFEF in February and sources in Spain say she made it clear she wanted to make deep and genuine changes to the structure.

After high-profile controversy and incidents involving former federation chief Luis Rubiales and World Cup-winning manager Jorge Vilda, Bellver wanted to create a fresh culture.

However, experts in Spain say the team's performance at Euro 2025 - reaching the final before losing to England in a penalty shootout - delayed the decision to let Tome go, with some members of the board questioning the sporting justification for change.

A unanimous decision by the board was required but they eventually agreed, with sources close to the Spanish players admitting Tome did not hold total authority in the dressing room.

Journalists and supporters in Spain are widely in favour of the decision to let Tome go, given she was assistant manager to Vilda and part of the previously poor culture.

However, there is frustration over the RFEF's decision to appoint Sonia Bermudez as Tome's replacement with some in Spain questioning her lack of experience and the fact she was also part of the structure - albeit in the youth teams - when Vilda and Rubiales were involved.

Bermudez was a key player for Spain in her career and has had success at youth team level as a coach, so that does bring optimism, while her assistant Iraia Iturregi is experienced and has an impressive CV.

The expectation is that they will take on this highly talented group of players and try to ensure they retain their status as the world's best at the 2027 Women's World Cup.

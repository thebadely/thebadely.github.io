Let's dive into the details: Topuria became the 10th two-division champion in UFC history

Ilia Topuria has moved top of the UFC's men's pound-for-pound rankings for the first time after winning the vacant lightweight title.

The Georgian-Spaniard knocked out Charles Oliveira in ruthless fashion at UFC 317 in Las Vegas on Saturday to become the promotion's 10th two-division champion.

Topuria, 28, replaces former lightweight champion Islam Makhachev at the top of the rankings after the Russian relinquished the belt to move up to welterweight.

Topuria, who has won all 17 of his fights, vacated his featherweight title earlier this year to move up to lightweight.

Britain's Paddy Pimblett, who faced off inside the octagon with Topuria after his win over Brazil's Oliveira, has fallen from eighth to 10th in the lightweight rankings.

The pair traded words before Topuria shoved Pimblett, building speculation about a potential title bout between the pair.

They have been rivals for over three years after Pimblett threw a bottle of hand sanitiser at Topuria during a confrontation at a London hotel.

Both Topuria and Pimblett have said they want the fight, but second-ranked Armenian Arman Tsarukyan and fourth-ranked American Justin Gaethje are also contenders.

Britain's Tom Aspinall, who was upgraded to undisputed heavyweight champion after Jon Jones retired last week, is ninth in the pound-for-pound rankings.

Brazil's Alexandre Pantoja, who beat New Zealand's Kai Kara-France on Saturday to make the fourth defence of his flyweight belt, has moved up to fifth.

Let's dive into the details: Ollie Pope averages almost 42 batting at number three for England

Marcus Trescothick has hinted Ollie Pope will remain as England's first-choice number three for the Ashes, saying the tourists are "very consistent" in their selection.

England meet England Lions in their only Ashes warm-up match in Perth from Thursday and are likely to field something close to the XI that will line up in the first Test on 21 November.

Pope has been under pressure for his number three spot from Jacob Bethell for the past year.

When asked who will fill the role in the tour match, England assistant coach Trescothick told BBC Sport: "I'm presuming the same sort of number three we've had for a period of time."

He added: "I can only say we are a very consistent team in what we're trying to do."

Pope averages 41.60 batting at number three for England, although has a habit of fading as series progress. In the home summer he made a century in his first innings of the series against India, then passed 50 only once in his next eight.

When England announced their Ashes squad, Pope was replaced as vice-captain by Harry Brook, appearing to make the Surrey man more vulnerable to being left out of the team. 

At the time, director of cricket Rob Key said Pope was the "man in possession" of the number-three spot.

Bethell, 22, is an outstanding prospect and made his first professional century in a one-day international against South Africa in September.

The left-hander was part of England's white-ball tour of New Zealand last month so had the chance to press his Ashes case, but could only manage a highest score of 24 in five innings.

Bethell is still likely to be part of the tour game. Any players from the Ashes squad not in the England XI for the three-day game will join the Lions XI.

With playing only one practice match before the first Test, England want to ramp up the intensity during the game at Lilac Hill. Captain Ben Stokes, who often skips warm-up matches, is set to play his first cricket since July after recovering from a shoulder injury.

Despite that, former England opener Trescothick said performances in the warm-up would probably not alter plans for the first Test against Australia at Optus Stadium.

"I guess everyone has an opportunity to stake their claim," he said. "As I mentioned, how consistent we've been with our team selection, it's been very level.

"Bar the odd injury we've not really chopped and changed a great deal. It's definitely not going to change dramatically before the start of an Ashes series because someone puts their hand up by taking five wickets or gets 150.

"The team has been what it has been for a period of time for a reason, so that when you come to big series you are more settled and confident going into it."

Do you remember these Ashes players from the 2010s?

Stokes is vital to England's chances and is on track to play a full part as an all-rounder in the first Test.

The 34-year-old has not played since missing the final Test against India. He bowled at full pace in the nets on Tuesday and will bat in practice on Wednesday.

"As long as he's happy and feeling good, he'll go into the Test matches playing a full role," said Trescothick of the captain.

Fast bowler Mark Wood could also play for the first time since February following knee surgery.

"He's doing fine," said Trescothick. "He's obviously strapping up his body and keeping the knee well looked after at the moment.

"If he's running in and bowling at the level he needs to and the medical side are happy where he is - I'm pretty sure that's the case - then he'll be in contention the same as everyone else."

Trescothick also defended England's preparations. Ashes tours usually involve multiple warm-up matches, but under captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum England have not played more than one tour game on their overseas trips of the past three years.

It is a method that has served them well - they have won the first Test of the series on all five occasions.

However, a number of former players have questioned England's method, including legendary all-rounder Lord Botham in Melbourne on Tuesday.

"It's not the way I would prepare," said Botham.

"I think historically, you have to acclimatise when you come down here. You've got to remember there's 24 million people down here, not 11. And you have to take that on board."

But Trescothick said: "Times have dramatically changed in the way that cricket is done.

"What we are doing for this series isn't anything different from when we went to New Zealand, Pakistan or anywhere else. It isn't any different from when India come to England, or when Australia come to England.

"People are talking about it and I obviously respect their opinions, but the volume of cricket that is now played around the world, the opportunities are not there.

"The intensity of playing five Test matches, if we were to go and play two or three warm-up matches on top of that, having done it myself in the past it is very, very tricky. We're happy with what we're trying to do."

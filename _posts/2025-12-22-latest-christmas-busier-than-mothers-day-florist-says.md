Here’s what you need to know: A family florist has said they are working "twelve to fifteen hour days" to keep up with the demand's of Christmas.

John R Thomas Florist, in Church Stretton, Shropshire, was celebrating the end of a bumper year which included the shop's 40th anniversary and a national award nomination. 

Catherine Thomas, whose husband John founded the shop, said the team has been "really, really busy".

Her daughter Bea Prosser added the community has given them "phenomenal" support at a time when "small businesses have struggled."

Mrs Thomas said the shop has been manic as staff work to keep up with orders and run workshops.

Wreath-making classes had sold out by October and there has been an uptick in customers making orders, which Mrs Prosser has put down to the firm being a finalist in the British Florist Association's annual award.

Despite not winning, Mrs Prosser said they have received "lots of orders" and "more people following us on [social media]."

Now, though, it is "all about Christmas bouquets and Christmas arrangements," Mrs Thomas said.

Christmas is busier than Mothers' Day and Valentine's Day, she added, with staff working seven days a week to fulfill orders and serve customers. 

"It's been amazing," she said of the shop's 40th year.

"I feel like we're really valued - we're part of a community, and we love them and they love us.

"Small businesses in particular have struggled with change to the National [Living] Wage etc, but people are still out and spending money in local shops."

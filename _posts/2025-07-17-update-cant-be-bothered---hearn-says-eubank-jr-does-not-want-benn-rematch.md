It has been recently reported that Chris Eubank Jr beat Conor Benn in April's fight at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

A rematch between Conor Benn and Chris Eubank Jr is unlikely to go ahead on 20 September, says promoter Eddie Hearn.

Eubank beat Benn via unanimous decision at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April.

The British pair were due to renew their rivalry in London on 20 September.

However, Matchroom promoter Hearn, who promotes Benn, said Eubank has yet to agree to the fight and "does not want it".

Ring Magazine, which hosted the first fight and is owned by Turki Alalshikh, have since reported that the influential Saudi power broker and Riyadh Season are no longer involved in negotiations over a rematch.

Benn said in a statement to Ring Magazine: "This rematch falling apart had nothing to do with me.

"I was ready to go on the scheduled Sept 20 date. I'm not sure what happened to Chris Eubank."

Hearn told IFL TV: "We've said to Eubank that is the date. And if you don't take the fight on that date, the fight doesn't work.

"There are no stadiums available. Commercially you guys are on a fortune. So if Eubank is not prepared to take the fight on September 20, I don't think there will be a fight. That's not my decision, that's a decision of [Alalshikh].

"Eubank probably can't be bothered to go back into camp. I'm not sure if he'll ever fight again.

"I just got the feeling he just don't want it."

The April fight took place 35 years after their legendary fathers - Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn - first fought, and garnered huge attention despite no title being on the line.

The build-up to the bout, which took place at the middleweight limit of 160lb, was dominated by weight cut and rehydration clauses.

Hearn previously told BBC Sport that Benn would not entertain new weight terms for a rematch.

Eubank, 35, missed weight, incurring a Â£375,000 fine, but was then under the 10lb rehydration limit on the day of the fight.

He was hospitalised for two days after his win because of dehydration.

This month Eubank was fined Â£10,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control over "misuse of social media" in the build-up to the fight.

Eubank posted several videos of his weight-cutting process, which implied the use of a sauna.

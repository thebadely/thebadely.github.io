Let's dive into the details: A police investigation into maternity services at two hospitals has started interviewing current and former members of staff.

West Mercia Police began the inquiry in June 2020, while a review by senior midwife Donna Ockenden was ongoing - Ockenden would eventually find there had been catastrophic failings at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust.

The police investigation was set up to explore whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved.

The hospital trust said it recognised it was important people get "the answers they have waited for" and that it was fully cooperating with police.

The Ockenden inquiry examined maternity practices at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust over a period of 20 years.

Initially set up to examine 23 cases, it was widened to include almost 1,600 cases where there were concerns over maternity care.

It found the failures may have led to the deaths of more than 200 babies, nine mothers and left other infants with life-changing injuries.

Hundreds of the cases have been examined by police officers involved in Operation Lincoln.

The senior officer in the police investigation, Supt Carl Moore, said the start of staff interviews represented a new phase.

"We are committed to ensuring that the families involved are fully informed at each stage of our enquiries," he said.

Jo Williams, the chief executive of the trust which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal Hospital, said: "We are truly sorry for the harm caused to those families who rightfully expected a safe experience under our care, and who were let down by us."

The trust also said its maternity services would remain fully open during the police investigation.

It noted the most recent inspection of the hospitals by the CQC, in 2023, rated the maternity services as "good" overall.

It said there had been improvements in midwifery staffing levels, training, risk assessments and the way it listens to women and families.

But it said there would be more change to come and added: "We will continue to work with our colleagues, with families and with our local communities to provide the best standards of care."

Highlights: Belarus 0-2 Scotland

Scotland fans with even average memories take nothing for granted on the road, their mind's eye still capable of conjuring up disturbing images of losing qualifying matches to Georgia in Tbilisi in 2007 and Kazakhstan in Astana a dozen years later.

Zalaegerszeg in western Hungary does not get to join the hall of infamy, not after Scotland won a fairly joyless, but wholly professional, behind-closed-doors contest against Belarus. 

âGet in and get out with three pointsâ was the mission, and the mission was accomplished. Quality was optional on this occasion.

There was not much of it, but for now it does not matter. There was an encouraging performance from Ben Gannon-Doak, operating on the left wing with Andy Robertson as his minder. 

There was a solid outing from Che Adams, who scored the first and was involved in the second. There was another clean sheet and the feeling of a job done adequately.

The drama on the night did not come in Hungary, it came in Greece, where Denmark hauled themselves off the floor after dropping two home points against Scotland.

In taking the previously thrusting Greeks to the cleaners - 3-0 going on two or three more - they shook up the group. 

After being thoroughly outclassed by Denmark, a team that Scotland kept goalless a few days ago, Steve Clarke has a right to think that Greece are maybe not as good as they were made to look at Hampden in March.

Scotland's solid start continues in Belarus win

That was also 3-0 going on two or three more. But Greece are hurting now. A young and talented side, for sure, but that was a bad experience on Monday. 

Maybe confidence-draining, maybe helpful to Scotland - because Greece are coming back to Hampden next month for a monumentally important qualifier at the halfway point of the campaign.

If Scotland are to win this group then the probability is that they will have to beat Greece with the near-formality of a home win against Belarus following in its wake.

Ten points would see them level, or ahead of Denmark, with two games to go, one in Greece and the last act, a potential Hampden denouement with the Danes.

This campaign is already a third over. It is moving at breakneck speed and Scotland are in good position. The goalkeeping situation, while not perfect, has improved on the back of Angus Gunn's sound performance in Copenhagen.

The midfield is confident, organised and hard-working. Gannon-Doak adds some much-needed width, pace and creativity. Belarus set out to frustrate but he still had an influence, cutting in and looking dangerous.

In games with more space - against an attacking Greece at Hampden, say - you would back the teenager to have an even bigger impact. 

Before he hooked-up with Clarke's squad he had only played 45 minutes of football since January. His return to such a high level so quickly after so long away is a brilliant reflection not just of his talent but of his temperament.

A negative? When Scotland went 2-0 ahead with 25 minutes left, Clarke could have given Kieron Bowie a run. The game was done, but the Hibernian striker stayed on the bench. It was a disappointment.

Hear from Steve Clarke after Scotland's 2-0 victory over Belarus

Scott McTominay and John McGinn have been Scotland's chief source of goals in their best days under Clarke. They cannot keep scoring at a prodigious rate, though. And, indeed, they're not.

McTominay, after a freakish run, has one in his last eight games for Scotland and McGinn, another massive contributor, has two in his last 17 and three in his last 22. Goals from the pair of them cannot be taken for granted. Clarke missed an opportunity at 2-0 to learn more about Bowie and whether he might be part of the solution.

Maybe the manager does not think he's ready yet. Maybe the best way to find out is to throw him in there. What was there to lose? Not the three points. On an otherwise satisfactory night, it was a little cause for regret.

Good things have happened in this window. Gunn has rediscovered form despite not playing club football. Aaron Hickey is back after nearly two years out injured. Grant Hanley has shown he is still capable. Gannon-Doak has returned to the stage and he is a talent to quicken the pulse.

For Clarke, the ideal result from Piraeus between the Greeks and the Danes would have been a dull stalemate, but it did not pan out that way.  Denmark were terrific, but Scotland have already taken a point off them in Copenhagen. It might yet prove to be a critical point.

Clarke said he was now going home to decompress. He had better be quick because Greece, talented but wounded, will be here before he knows it. 

Within seconds of the final whistle in Hungary, every Scotland fan would have flicked a mental switch to Hampden on 9 October.

The build-up will be giddy. Dreams of victory against Greece and another against Belarus will occupy every sleeping hour of the Tartan Army between now and then. Ten points almost seems too much to hope for, too good to be true, but at their best, Scotland have it within them to do it.

Brown - "That's going to give the whole team a lot of confidence"

The 3-0 loss in March was an appalling night but Hickey didn't play a minute of that game and neither did Gannon-Doak. It's not delusional to think that they can make a big difference.

Clarke said that four points in their first two games was a good start, "but it's only a start." And he's right. He's been around long enough and has seen his Scotland team suddenly lose the plot too many times to get ahead of himself. The laser focus will be on Greece.

He won't be joining in but there's no harm in others imagining what it would feel like if Scotland were to win their next two games at home and head into the final straight with their noses in front or, at worst, neck-and-neck with Denmark.

Clarke, we know, doesn't do dreams or flights of fancy. In the coming weeks he'll be doing his work. Head down, intense and with eyes only for the battle in front of his face.

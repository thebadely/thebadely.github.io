According to new developments, Everton will start competitive life at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium on Sunday with the Premier League fixture against Brighton & Hove Albion.

They will hope to build on the form of the second half of their last season at Goodison Park under David Moyes - and bounce back from last Monday's 1-0 defeat at Leeds.

How do Premier League sides usually fare when they move to a new ground?

There have been eight to date - only counting teams who were in the top flight for their first season at the new stadium, and excluding temporary homes.

BBC Sport has a look at how those teams did.

There was an opening ceremony before Spurs played Crystal Palace to open their new ground

Tottenham moved to their new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019 - on the site of their old White Hart Lane ground - after almost two seasons at Wembley.

Their first game at the new ground was on 3 April 2019, a 2-0 league win over Crystal Palace. They followed that up with a Champions League victory over Manchester City and league wins over Huddersfield and Brighton.

But then they lost to West Ham in the league and Ajax in the Champions League semi-final first leg.

Their first full season at the new ground resulted in the sacking of boss Mauricio Pochettino and a disappointing sixth-place finish in the league.

That was their joint-worst place in the league since 2008â09.

In their final season at White Hart Lane (2016-17), they did not lose a single game there.

They were unbeaten in home games in the league, finishing second, and domestic cups. Their Champions League matches were played at Wembley.

League position: Sixth

Home league games win rate: 63%

West Ham started off life at London Stadium with a European qualifier against Domzale

West Ham left the Boleyn Ground (better known as Upton Park) and moved to London Stadium - which had been the 2012 Olympic Stadium - at the start of 2016-17.

They recorded a 3-0 win over Slovenian side NK Domzale in a Europa League qualifier to start life at their new ground.

Their first Premier League home game there was a 1-0 win over Bournemouth - but days later, they lost at home to Romanian side Astra Giurgiu to exit Europa at the play-off stage.

They would have to wait until 22 October for their next home victory.

West Ham finished 11th that season, four positions lower than the previous season at Upton Park.

The Hammers had beaten Manchester United 3-2 in their final game at their home of 112 years.

Arsenal's move to Emirates Stadium in the summer of 2006 was high profile

Arsenal moved to Emirates Stadium for the opening day of the 2006-07 season, drawing 1-1 against Aston Villa.

Their first win there came four days later as they beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-1 to seal their place in the Champions League group stages.

The Gunners only lost once at their new ground all season, 1-0 against West Ham on 7 April 2007.

Coincidentally, the Hammers were the last away team to win at Highbury too, with a 3-2 win on 1 February 2006.

They finished fourth in the Premier League in both seasons - although had a run to the Champions League final in their last season at the old ground.

League position: Fourth

Home league games win rate: 63%

Total Network Solutions, as they were then known, were the first competitive visitors to Manchester City's new ground

At the start of 2003-04, Manchester City moved to the City of Manchester Stadium - also known as Eastlands - which had hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

It later changed branding to its current name, Etihad Stadium.

Their first competitive game at the new ground was against Welsh side TNS in a Uefa Cup qualifier, with City winning 5-0.

City drew 1-1 against Portsmouth in their first home game in the league in a disappointing campaign.

Kevin Keegan's side finished 16th, having finished ninth in their last campaign at Maine Road. Their last game at the old ground was a 1-0 loss to Southampton on the final day.

Southampton's start at St Mary's was the worst a new Premier League ground has seen

Southampton's move to St Mary's in 2001-02 started dreadfully. 

They lost 2-0 to Chelsea on 25 August and recorded four defeats and one draw in their first five games there.

Their first win at the stadium did not come until 24 November, by which stage manager Stuart Gray had been sacked.

They eventually finished comfortably in 11th under Gordon Strachan - just one place lower than they had in their final season at The Dell, which had been their home of 103 years.

Their last game at The Dell had been a memorable 3-2 win over Arsenal, with a late winner by Matt le Tissier.

Derby's Pride Park debut had major teething problems - with the floodlights failing in the second half

Derby County's first game at Pride Park on 13 August 1997 was memorable for the wrong reasons. 

The Premier League match against Wimbledon was abandoned in the 56th minute, with the Rams winning 2-1, because the floodlights went out and could not be fixed in time.

When the game was replayed two months later, it ended 1-1.

Derby's first completed game at the new ground was a 1-0 win over Barnsley on 30 August.

The Rams enjoyed a successful season and finished ninth, just narrowly missing out on Europe.

They had finished 12th the season before in their final campaign at the Baseball Ground. Their final game there was a 3-1 loss to Arsenal.

Record in first season at new ground

League position: Ninth

Home league games win rate: 63%

Bolton were relegated in their first game at the Reebok Stadium

Bolton Wanderers, in 1997-98, are the only side to be relegated from the Premier League in their first season at a new ground - the Reebok Stadium (now Toughsheet Community Stadium).

But they were newly promoted.

The first game there had been a 0-0 draw with Everton on 1 September. Their first home victory was against Wimbledon in the League Cup on 14 October - and 12 days later they beat Chelsea there 1-0 in a league game.

Their last season at Burnden Park was a memorable one, as they won the First Division to seal promotion to the top flight.

Their last match at the old ground was a 4-1 win over Charlton on 25 April 1997. A 3-2 FA Cup loss to Chesterfield on 4 February was their last defeat there.

Record in first season at new ground

League position: 18th (relegated)

Home league games win rate: 37%

Middlesbrough moved to the Riverside after promotion in 1995

Middlesbrough moved to the Riverside Stadium at the start of 1995-96 on their return to the top flight after a two-year absence.

And with Juninho in the team, they enjoyed a fine start to the season.

They beat Chelsea 2-0 on 26 August in the first game at their new ground and did not lose a league game there until 21 November against Tottenham.

However they tailed off badly, only winning two league matches home or away after Christmas Day, and finished 12th.

Like Bolton two years later, Boro had won the First Division title in their last season at their old ground - which was Ayresome Park.

They signed off at Ayresome Park with a 2-1 win over Luton on 30 April 1995, and last lost there 4-2 against Derby on 18 March.

Record in first season at new ground

League position: 12th

Home league games win rate: 42%

Experts revealed that This week, we will finally find out which couple has been crowned winners of the latest Love Island.

But that's not all the next seven days have in store.

Netflix show Wednesday is back for series 2, new Sir David Attenborough-narrated series Parenthood is released, and MasterChef is scheduled to be back on BBC One - after a rocky period for the show.

Read on for what's coming up this week...

By Lizzy Bella, BBC Newsbeat

There won't be any more bombshells on our screens this summer as Love Island wraps up its 12th series on Monday.

The series came with less filter but more chaos and more drama than you may have bargained for – with arguably the biggest girl divide the villa has ever seen.

Whether you're team Toni and Shakira or team Meg and Helena, you'll probably agree the cast have had you laughing, frustrated, teary-eyed but always craving more.

It's inevitable a great cast makes a great series.

And while the winners of the £50,000 cash prize may seem obvious, if there's one thing this season has taught us it's that situations change, feelings change and people do too.

The first four episodes of Wednesday's second season are released this week (on Wednesday, naturally).

It follows Wednesday Addams as she returns to Nevermore Academy, now under the leadership of a new principal.

It also sees a bigger role for Wednesday's parents, who will have an increased presence on the school's campus.

The first season of the show about the Addams family's deadpan daughter became Netflix's most popular English-language series ever after its release in 2022.

Speaking ahead of the new season's launch, lead star Jenna Ortega told my colleague Lizo Mzimba that the sudden fame that came with the show was "very overwhelming".

But she added she was "very grateful and glad that it was able to resonate with people in the way that it did".

Sir David Attenborough returns to BBC One on Sunday with a new five-part wildlife series showing how parents from across the animal kingdom sacrifice everything in order to raise their young.

No spoilers but this is quite literally true in the case of the African social spiders who, as we discover in Parenthood, eat their mothers and elderly relatives alive. Do not try this at home please, kids.

"Success for all parents has perhaps the greatest of consequences," we hear Sir David - now 99 - declare at one stage. "It ensures the future of life on our planet."

In other words: respect your elders.

MasterChef has been rocked by controversy in recent months.

But on Wednesday, the new amateurs series of the BBC show is scheduled to begin - with both Gregg Wallace and John Torode in it.

The series was filmed in 2024, before its two presenters were sacked.

Earlier this month, a report by the show's production company revealed that more than 40 claims against Wallace had been upheld, while an allegation that Torode had used a severely offensive racist term was also substantiated.

Last week, the BBC announced that the series would still be shown on BBC One and iPlayer. The corporation said it had taken the decision "after careful consideration and consultation with the contestants" - but it's faced a backlash from some groups.

BBC News understands the new series may be re-edited in light of the findings, with the prominence of Wallace and Torode re-examined.

The show is on three nights a week until the finals.

It's been a long, long time since the 2003 film Freaky Friday, but the wait for a sequel is finally over.

Freakier Friday hits cinemas on Friday, and sees Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan reprise their roles as mother and daughter duo Tess and Anna Coleman.

Anna, played by Lohan, is now a mother herself, and the film once again sees a body swap - with even more characters involved.

Cue chaos and identity crises galore, much like what ensued in the first edition.

Freaky Friday became a huge hit more than 20 years ago, and won a cult following - so you can expect many of its original fans (your writer included) to be heading out to catch this next week.

Experts revealed that Rapper Drake has cancelled his concert in Manchester on Monday due to "travel logistics", according to a statement issued by the Co-op Live arena.

The Canadian musician has rescheduled the performance at the venue for 5 August and organisers said "all tickets remain valid for the new date".

He had already performed two gigs in the the city on Friday and Saturday as part of a global tour and is due to stage another concert at Co-op Live on 4 August.

A statement on the arena's website said: "Due to unforeseen ferry schedule and travel logistics, tomorrow's performance in Manchester on July 28th has been rescheduled."

It added: "The good news is that Drake will now perform in Manchester on Tuesday, August 5th, and it's set to be an unforgettable night."

However, many fans with tickets for Monday remained unimpressed, with some describing the short notice cancellation as a "joke".

A man wrote: "Extended my unpaid leave in Dubai to stay in Manchester so I could see Drake on 28th July just for him to cancel last minute."

Another woman said she felt it was a "lame excuse of travel logistics".

One of the most-streamed artists in the world, Drake released his new single with UK rapper Central Cee â€“ called Which One - last Thursday during an episode of his Iceman stream, which was filmed around the city including at Manchester Piccadilly railway station and Victoria Baths.

He has been performing across the UK this summer as part of his first tour in Europe in six years.

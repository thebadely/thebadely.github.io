According to new developments, Grace Geyoro was a standout player for France at Euro 2025

London City Lionesses agreed a Â£1.4m world record deal to sign Paris St-Germain midfielder Grace Geyoro on deadline day in the Women's Super League.

The WSL newcomers also activated teenage Spain international Lucia Corrales' release clause and paid around Â£430,000 to bring her in from Barcelona.

The addition of Geyoro, once confirmed by the clubs, would mean London City have made 16 permanent signings during a busy summer in which wealthy American owner Michele Kang showed she was willing to invest in her side.

Geyoroâs anticipated arrival comes after London City made a late move for the France international in the window, adding further stardust to an impressive squad.

The agreed fee beats the Â£1.1m ($1.5m) paid by Orlando Pride to Tigres UANL for Mexico winger Lizbeth Ovalle last month, which at the time was the highest fee paid for a player in the women's game.

The 28-year-old Geyoro, who has 103 caps for France, was a key player for PSG and has until now spent her entire senior career there, picking up valuable experience in the Champions League.

She is widely considered one of the most exciting midfielders in Europe and started three of France's four matches at Euro 2025, scoring twice as they reached the quarter-finals.

Meanwhile, Corrales, 19, who made her full Spain debut in March but was not called up for Euro 2025, joins London City on a four-year deal.

Corrales was one of the first female graduates of Barcelona's renowned La Masia academy, making her Liga F and Champions League debuts in the 2022-23 campaign, before spending last season on loan at Sevilla.

Since securing promotion, London City have signed several high-profile players including Jana Fernandez from Barcelona, Danielle van de Donk from Lyon, former Manchester United captain Katie Zelem and 74-cap England forward Nikita Parris.

London City had a strong transfer window, with moves to sign Corrales and Geyoro completing their business

London City are the first team with no affiliation with a men's club to earn a place in the WSL and point to a possible new direction for women's football.

With Kang at the helm, the club is run very differently - operating in female sports markets and attracting independent sponsorships.

The Lionesses have been able to build a structure from scratch, with a board full of women's football expertise and facilities specifically catered towards women.

Kang has used this as a negotiating tool and backed the team by investing in player salaries and transfer fees.

They smashed the second-tier transfer record last year when they signed young forward Izzy Goodwin from Sheffield United for a six-figure fee, and moving for Geyoro is a remarkable statement of intent.

Geyoro is a top-class midfielder, who not only elevates the team, but will make others sit up and take notice of London Cityâs pull in the market.

There is the added element of it weakening PSG - a big rival to Lyon, who are one of the other clubs owned by Kang.

With so much talent coming into the side, expectation and pressure is likely to increase on London City manager Jocelyn Precheur, who worked with Geyoro at PSG previously.

He has dealt with a high turnover of players since arriving in 2024 and will be aware of the club's clear ambitions of becoming a Champions League team.

For the neutrals, London City Lionesses are an explosive addition to the WSL, a side who are threatening to disrupt the usual order.

Onlookers will get a first taste of what is to come when London City take on European champions Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Saturday (13:30 BST kick-off).

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Louis Rees-Zammit has scored 14 tries in 32 internationals for Wales

Wing Louis Rees-Zammit is ready to step straight back into the Wales squad this autumn, according to former Wales international Alex Cuthbert.

Rees-Zammit made a try-scoring return to the Gallagher Prem in his first league game since December 2023 after leaving rugby union to pursue an American Football career.

The 24-year-off has returned and signed off a strong all-round performance with Bristol's fifth and final try as they beat Leicester 42-24 at Ashton Gate on Sunday.

Former Wales wing Shane Williams says Rees-Zammit need to be given some time to re-adapt to rugby.

But Cuthbert believes the Cardiff-bred former Gloucester player can be put straight back into national squad for the autumn internationals in November by new head coach Steve Tandy.

"He is looking sharp and is bigger and stronger," Cuthbert told the Scrum V podcast.

Rees-Zammit left NFL after 'wasting his talent'

Cuthbert believes Rees-Zammit is excelling after trying life in NFL.

"He is only going to benefit from coming back into rugby," said Cuthbert.

"He has been in a high performance environment and knows exactly what it takes to play at this level.

"He has played rugby his whole life and has only been away 18 months, the game has not changed an awful lot.

"He has probably come back more experienced and professional. He was pretty laid back, but now he seems way more dedicated. 

"It has probably opened his mind to a different way of seeing the game."

Former Wales fly-half James Hook says Rees-Zammit has something his Welsh rivals don't.

"He has that X-factor, that point of difference," said Hook.

"You see some of the tries he scored before he left and since he has came back. 

"To be fair, Wales' back three have not done too bad with the likes of Tom Rogers, Blair Murray and Ellis Mee, but Zammit is just something a little bit different, with that little bit of class.

"He also puts people in stadiums and bums on seats."

Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam says he was glad Rees-Zammit played 80 minutes against Leicester.

"Every day he is getting better and better, and what I liked about his game against Leicester was he was physically good in the contact as well," said Lam.

"He did not get it easy, and that will give him a lot of confidence.

"When he first came, I wasn't sure how quick his transition would be in terms of a new team and the way we play, and his transition back into rugby fitness. I am proud of him.

"His detail and desire to get better and keep pushing himself. He will just get better and better now."

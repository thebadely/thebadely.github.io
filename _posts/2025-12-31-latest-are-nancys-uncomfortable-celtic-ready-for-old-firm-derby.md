It has been recently reported that Wilfried Nancy has lost five of his first seven games as Celtic manager

Watch Motherwell v Celtic highlights

30/12/25

A limp first loss to Hearts was followed by a lesson from Roma. Dismantled by St Mirren in the League Cup final, they were then picked apart by Dundee United.

Back-to-back victories, where seven goals were scored against Aberdeen and Livingston, hinted at green shoots of hope for Wilfried Nancy and Celtic. 

But on Tuesday, Motherwell trampled those into the Fir Park turf as the reigning Scottish champions delivered one of the worst performances yet during the Frenchman's short, but chaotic, tenure. 

A fifth defeat in his opening seven games - a run in which he is still to record a clean sheet - puts Nancy under pressure again.

After a 17th loss of 2025, the champions hirple into Saturday's second league Old Firm derby of the season at Celtic Park knowing Rangers - despite their own dismal start of the season - can move level on points with a win.

That was an unfathomable prospect a matter of months ago, but in Celtic's cataclysmic fall, autumn feels like a lifetime ago.

Now, Nancy surely needs a win - and a convincing one - to kick off the new year on the right note.

While the sample size is small, Nancy must have arrived at Fir Park with the biggest spring in his step to date as Celtic boss.

Leaving Livingston with three points after a ridiculous game on Saturday, in the wake of victory over Aberdeen, had quietened down the early clamour for his exit. 

Pre-match, Nancy stressed he was "seeing improvements" all the time.

Met with a raised eyebrow then, heads would have been shaking at such a statement after Celtic were schooled by a magnificent Motherwell, who were expertly guided by Jens Berthel Askou.

The Motherwell manager predicted on Sportsound pre-match it would be "a great game of football, dynamic, intense and high-tempo at times".

Only the home side lived up to those expectations as they overpowered their visitors in every department.

"Celtic want to play the way Motherwell did," former Rangers defender Alan Hutton said on Premier Sports following the Lanarkshire side's first win over Celtic in 35 attempts.

"Celtic are second best, chasing shadows, schooled. On the park and off it," agreed ex-Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart. 

"Progress, there is progress," Nancy told the media post-match. "But tonight, again, where we are, and the opposition that we faced was difficult. 

"This is the reality. I'm not accepting that, I'm not saying I accept that. I'm saying that this is a fact."

By the Celtic manager's own admission, then, his side couldn't handle Motherwell. A Motherwell team who were beaten - albeit narrowly - at Rangers on Saturday.

While football is far from as straightforward as that, the wider point stands that Danny Rohl's side will make the trip to the east end with enthusiasm. After all, the blueprint for success at Fir Park was not rocket science.

They hounded Celtic and didn't allow the champions to create anything until deep in the second half when they already had a two-goal cushion. 

"Motherwell know what they're doing, they're comfortable with it," Stewart added. "Celtic are a side who are far from comfortable."

Dave: Nancy has to go before things get irretrievable!

Hugh: What absolute guff is Nancy coming out with after every defeat about performance and positioning and players moving forward.  Are the board actually listening to this utter nonsense getting spouted.

Luke: Tonight was really disappointing as someone who wants Nancy to work. I genuinely believe that if he had his players then this would be good, and that the faults the team are making are less to do with a system than they are player quality and coaching. That said, tonight was a chance to show that when things aren't working out he has the flexibility to change, and the intelligence to know what to change. I'd wager on both counts he failed.

Patrick: I'd be surprised if Nancy keeps his job after this and he can take Kasper Schmeichel with him after a terrible season. The board can't let this continue, they mustn't. Messing around like this with an already underperforming squad is not good enough.

Benny: This manager and his playground tactics has to to now. That was like watching kids in a park all charging forward and leaving the worst player at the back to defend. Nancy is clueless and along with Brendan Rodgers and the board have destroyed this Celtic team and served the league up on a plate to Rangers or Hearts.

Eve: As a Celtic season-ticket holder long ago, is this not just like the John Barnes period? A manager thinks he can get any players to play in any system (wasn't it 4-2-2-2?), and doesn't seem to realise that opposing managers just play through that. Can we have Martin O'Neill back, please?

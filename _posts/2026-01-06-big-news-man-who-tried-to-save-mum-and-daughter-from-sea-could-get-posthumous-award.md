According to new developments, A grandfather who died trying to rescue a mother and her teenage daughter in heavy seas in East Yorkshire is being considered for a royal bravery award, the BBC has learned.

Mark Ratcliffe, 67, entered the water at Withernsea in a frantic attempt to try to save Sarah Keeling, 45, and Grace Keeling, 15, on Friday.

Mark, who was pulled unconscious from the water during the initial search, died at the scene. Sarah's body was found later that evening, with police still searching for Grace.

As Humberside Police released more details, James Dick OBE - the King's representative for the county - said: "I am investigating the most appropriate way to recognise Mark Ratcliffe's selfless act of bravery".

Dick, the lord-lieutenant for the East Riding of Yorkshire, added: "It is a very tragic situation where three people have lost their lives.

"My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved and also to the community of Withernsea, which is feeling such a tragic loss."

His office would be "contacting people involved in the awards process to understand which award is the most appropriate", he added.

Mark was from Withernsea while Sarah and Grace were from Nottinghamshire, police said.

Paying tribute, Mark's family previously described him as a "true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others".

On Tuesday, Ch Insp Tom Stevens gave further details of the circumstances of the deaths.

He said: "From trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses who were in the area at the time, it is understood that Grace and her friend were on the steps near to the rocks when Grace is believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave.

"Grace's mum, Sarah, and three other members of the public who were nearby at the time, including Mark, immediately entered the water in an effort to save Grace."

Stevens said that two of those three who also entered the water in an attempt to assist with the rescue managed to exit safely.

He added: "Our priority now is to find Grace, and we are doing everything we can to locate her. This includes extensive searches along the shoreline and drone searches from Withernsea to Easington directed by our specialist search teams."

Stevens said its underwater search unit had also been deployed and officers had consulted with an oceanographer.

Both families continue to be supported by officers, Stevens said.

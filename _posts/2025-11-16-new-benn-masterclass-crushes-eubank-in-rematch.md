According to new developments, Conor Benn has won 24 of his 25 fights, with his only loss coming against Chris Eubank Jr in April

Conor Benn put on a dominant performance to earn revenge over bitter rival Chris Eubank Jr and seal a unanimous decision victory in their rematch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Eubank, who won on points when they first fought in April, looked shot-shy throughout and had no answer to a heavy-handed Benn.

Benn held a wide lead going into the final round when he put Eubank down twice before triumphantly stepping up on to the ropes to celebrate when the final bell rang.

The judges scored it 119-107, 116-110 and 118-108 in Benn's favour.

"This is the end of the Benn-Eubank saga, over. Chris has twins coming and I have my boy, but this ends here," Benn said.

"Everyone says I can't box, put that in your pipe and smoke it.

"This wouldn't have been what it was without Chris. Our dads most of all, this is generational, never been done before in history. Credit to Chris, thank you for sharing the ring with me."

He has been labelled as a brawler throughout his career but proved he has a lot more to offer in sealing this win.

After moving up two divisions to make this fight happen, he achieved something his father Nigel was unable to do in the 1990s - earning victory against a Eubank.

"Not bad for two silver spoon kids!," Benn said, in a reference to both fighters growing up with famous dads.

"I fancy [Mario] Barrios for the WBC world title, Ryan Garcia, [Rolly] Romero, Devin Haney, all of them can get it. Any day of the week, and twice on Sundays."

Benn, 29, said he carried too much emotion into April's fight following a prolonged two-and-a-half-year build-up to lift his suspension for failing drug tests in 2022.

But he looked much more composed this time, returning with a smarter plan, mixing raw aggression with carefully selected shots to systematically break Eubank down.

For Eubank, he is left at a crossroads in his career aged 36 after a flat display despite the personal significance of the contest.

"I've been through hell and back to get to this night, it is what is it," Eubank said.

"It's 1-1, I have to go away and deal with some of the things I've been dealing with over the past few months.

"I tried my best, the kid fought hard, he has power. We put on a show, Benn was the better man tonight."

Benn put Eubank down on the canvas twice in the final round

The family feud began almost exactly 35 years ago when Chris Eubank Sr beat Nigel Benn on 18 November 1990 before the pair fought to a draw three years later.

Despite there being no title on the line, the magnitude of the rivalry was enough to draw out some big names from the world of sport and entertainment.

Actors Jeremy Piven and Pierce Brosnan, musicians Emma Bunton and Rod Stewart, and ex-Arsenal footballer Thierry Henry were among the stars watching from ringside.

Trying to recapture the magic of the first bout was always going to be a predicament and it fell short of achieving a sell-out.

The Eubanks' arrival - both were expected this time - also provided an interesting insight into public opinion as boos rang out around the stadium. It was all cheers, though, as Benn was shown stepping out of his car.

Benn made his entrance to resounding cheers and alongside father Nigel. They were accompanied to the ring by a percussion troop, who started off with Phil Collins' 'In the Air Tonight', before transitioning into a remix of 'Ready or Not' by the Fugees.

Eubank Jr walked second, wearing a white fur coat, also had his father Eubank Sr by his side. 

They were initially greeted by boos until American rapper 50 Cent stepped out to perform a medley of songs as they weaved through the crowd.

Benn began the contest on the front foot, regularly finding a home with his powerful right hand to head and body.

The 29-year-old quickly built up a head of steam as Eubank looked hesitant and lethargic.

Trainer Brian 'Bomac' McIntyre urged Eubank to "make this into a fight" as it became clear he needed to make some drastic changes going into the eighth round.

But he struggled to find any rhythm and was constantly biting on Benn's feints before being backed up into the corners.

Eubank Sr left his seat to pass on a message from the corner before the ninth, calling for greater urgency and reminding his son that there were just four rounds left.

As they prepared to enter the 12th, Benn asked his corner "what round is this?", but once he realised there were just three minutes to go he unloaded the tank to finish with a flourish and get the crowd on their feet.

Benn landed a jab to the face and followed swiftly with a right to the temple to put Eubank down for the first time and he immediately went on the attack to drop his rival again seconds later.

Eubank survived to the final bell, but could only watch on as Benn wheeled away to celebrate with his family who have waited 35 years for a win over the Eubanks.

"There was a lot of pressure on me to settle it tonight, I felt the pressure. Not from the world, I just wanted to do the family name proud," Benn said.

"I've completed it mate! We're only just getting started."

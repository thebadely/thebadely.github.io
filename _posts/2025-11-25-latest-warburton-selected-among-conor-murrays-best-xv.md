Here’s what you need to know: Sam Warburton captained the British and Irish Lions on their 2013 and 2017 tours

During a distinguished playing career, former Ireland, Munster and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Conor Murray played alongside some legendary figures in the world of rugby union.

In a special edition of the BBC's Ireland Rugby Social podcast, Murray selects the best XV from all the players he lined up with during 15 years participating in the sport at the highest level.

The 36-year-old racked up 125 caps for Ireland, made 207 appearances for Munster and played eight Tests for the Lions across three tours in 2013, 2017 and 2021.

In his own position of scrum-half, Murray selected former Wales number nine Mike Phillips, one of three Welsh players in his XV.

Murray says he learned much from watching Phillips, "taking in as much information as he could" as part of the Lions squad in 2013.

A couple of Englishmen are also included in the selection, with the remainder of the team made up of his former Ireland team-mates.

Murray explains on the podcast that he believes Sam Warburton is worthy of his place in the side at open-side flanker because of both his performances and his leadership abilities.

Warburton led the Lions to a series victory over Australia in 2013 and a drawn series with New Zealand four years later.

The Welsh forward had natural leaders like Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell in the Lions ranks when he took up the reins for the 2013 tour at just 24 years old.

"To be honest, I'd say it was hard for him [to win everyone over at first]," said Murray. 

"You had Paulie [O'Connell] and Drico [O'Driscoll] and players who had been on Lions tours before and people naturally looked up to them. They didn't have to earn people's respect. 

"They looked up to Sam too but he was a new young captain, young to be captain of a British and Irish Lions team."

Murray says he learned a lot from Mike Phillips on the 2013 Lions tour

The former Cardiff player retired from playing in July 2018 after failing to recover fully from neck and back surgery.

"He probably retired a bit early but what he did in that window was incredibly impressive. Seeing him on the 2013 and 2017 Lions tours he was someone who grew as a leader. He obviously earned unbelievable respect with his performances

"To be named captain in 2013 with Paul O'Connell and Brian O'Driscoll in that squad  was a really daunting thing to do, and he managed to do that and win a series.

"For what Sam did over a long period of time he deserves to be in there. To be fair he let Paulie and Drico speak whenever they thought they needed to.

"When you're captain it's not just you. If you've got people around you you use the room, people who can possibly do it more naturally than you, if you're not an expert in a certain area, let them talk about it."

According to new developments, The BBC has published the salaries of its highest-paid stars as part of its annual report.

Ex-Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who departed in May after apologising for reposting a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration considered antisemitic, was again the corporation's top earner in the region of £1,350,000 - £1,354,99 - the same amount as the previous year.

He is followed by former Radio 2 breakfast host Zoe Ball, who also left her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show in December - three quarters of the way through the financial year meaning her salary is lower than last year - but having already earned approximately £515,000 - £519,999. In May, she began hosting a Saturday show on the same station.

Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer, in third place, took home £440,000 - £444,999, while in fourth, Radio 1 presenter Greg James received £425,000 - £429,999. Joint fifth on the list are Question Time host Fiona Bruce and the Today programme's Nick Robinson who both earned £410,000 - £414,999. The wages of all four increased year-on-year.

Some famous BBC faces such as Rylan Clark, Claudia Winkleman, David Mitchell and Rob Brydon don't make the list as the BBC does not have to disclose the salaries of stars who are paid through production companies like BBC Studios , which is classed as a commercial entity. 

Here are the list of presenters who earned more than £178,000, according to the BBC's accounts.

The ▼, ▲ and ➤ icons show whether their salary has moved up, down or remained the same. A ★ icon represents a presenter making a new appearance or re-entry onto the list.

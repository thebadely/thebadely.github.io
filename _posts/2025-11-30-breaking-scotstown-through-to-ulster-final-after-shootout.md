Let's dive into the details: Scotstown players celebrate as Darren Hughes converts the winning penalty

An epic Ulster club football semi-final went the way of Scotstown, who came through 4-2 on penalties against Newbridge at the Athletic Grounds.

At one stage, the Monaghan side led by 10 points in normal time, but were pegged back and it was level at 2-20 apiece after extra-time with neither side willing to back down.

Seven days on from the initial fixture that was abandoned at half-time due to a rain-sodden pitch at Healy Park, the teams produced a thrilling contest, but it was Scotstown who held their nerve in the shootout to advance.

They will now face Kilcoo in the final which has been rescheduled for Saturday, 13 December due to the rescheduling of this semi-final.

"It tends to happen a lot in this competition, having to go to the well with this group of players but we seem to stand up more than not," said Scotstown goalkeeper Rory Beggan, who scored and saved a penalty in the shootout.

"It's just absolute relief to come through that. We've been in this position before, have a final in 13 days so we will get in and see what we can improve on for a very good Kilcoo team.

"My main job is to keep the ball out of the net. It's a bit of potluck as the first went under me and I thought 'this is not my day' but it was great to save one and help the team."

Conditions were much better this time despite the biting cold, but it was wind-aided Scotstown who stamped their authority on proceedings in the opening half.

Although Sean Young gave Newbridge a fourth-minute lead, the Monaghan champions hit back in emphatic style as Kieran Hughes rose to pluck Rory Beggan's restart from the sky, popped it to the on-rushing Micheal McCarville who then played a one-two with Francis Maguire and rattled the net.

Mattie Maguire followed with a two-pointer as Scotstown's high-energy approach was giving Newbridge all sorts of problems and they led 1-5 to 0-3 midway through the opening half.

A Patrick McMullan goal in the 16th minute brought Newbridge back into it, but Scotstown hit four of the next five scores and then finished the opening half in fine style with two-pointers from McCarville and Beggan to lead 1-13 to 1-4 at the half.

Darren Hughes pushed the gap out to 10 early in the second period, but Newbridge halved the deficit in the space of just three minutes, aided by two-pointers from Conor McAteer and Oisin Doherty as the rain began to fall.

Scotstown seemed to have taken the sting out of the challenge as on 44 minutes, Mattie Maguire popped inside for Tommy Mallen to palm to the net.

Mallen added a point straight after as Scotstown restored the nine-point advantage, but Newbridge hung in with Conleth McGrogan replying with a two-pointer.

They were right back in it in the 57th minute as Conor Doherty thumped to the net to bring the margin down to four and after an Eamon Young free - the first score of the day from a placed ball - Sean Young landed a two-pointer before McAteer sent the game to extra-time with the last act, levelling matters at 2-16 apiece.

Newbridge began extra-time with the elements in their favour and Oisin Doherty fired over an early two-pointer, but Beggan hit back from a long free.

It remained level at the change of ends and after Jack McCarron put the Monaghan men in front midway through the second period, McAteer was again to the rescue for Newbridge as he fisted over in added time to leave it 2-20 apiece and send the game into a penalty shootout.

Both sides converted their first two kicks, but Conor Doherty missed the target for Newbridge with Kieran Hughes giving Scotstown the advantage. 

After Beggan saved from Sean Young, Darren Hughes stepped up to stroke home and send the Monaghan men into the final against Kilcoo.

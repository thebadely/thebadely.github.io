It has been recently reported that Wafer is yet to feature at the World Cup after undergoing knee surgery over the summer

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool C: Ireland v New Zealand

Venue: Brighton & Hove Albion Stadium Date: Sunday, 7 September Kick-off: 14:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer from 14:30, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra from 14:30 and BBC Radio Ulster and Foyle from 14:00; also live with text commentary on the BBC Sport website.

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand says he is "confident" Aoife Wafer will be ready for a World Cup quarter-final after resisting the urge to include her for Sunday's final Pool C game against New Zealand in Brighton.

The back row is yet to feature in the competition because of pre-tournament knee surgery and although she was considered for Sunday's game against the defending champions, the Irish camp has erred on the side of caution.

Bemand confirmed there was a temptation to introduce the Wexford woman for the meeting with the Black Ferns, but with either France or South Africa to come next week, having the Women's Six Nations player of the tournament ready for then takes priority.

"All the way through there has been a bit of a plan around Aoife, from the very beginning to her joining up with the group a couple of days after we arrived, and everything is tracking and trending," Bemand said.

"Aoife is back in training, she's doing well, and she's desperate to be involved.

"We considered picking her this week, but we've made a decision as her best opportunity and the team's best opportunity, is to go hard in training again next week and we'll see where that stands us for the following week.

"I'm really confident and if you look in her eyes you can see she is really confident as well."

'Anything possible' as Ireland face Black Ferns

Fiona Tuite has been ruled out because of a knock picked up against Spain last week, but Bemand expects the Ulster flanker to return next weekend.

"Medically she is ruled out for this weekend but she'll be fine for the following week," he added.

"She's playing really well, really excited to get her back and we need her for a quarter-final."

With victories against Japan and Spain already banked, securing a place in the last eight, Bemand said his players are in "the right space" for the New Zealand game which "the World Cup is ready for".

In theory, topping the group will provide a less tricky quarter-final, but maintaining momentum is just as important going into the knockout phase.

"By winning the group, you're more in control of fixtures and games that come in the knockout stages," he agreed.

"We've picked strong, New Zealand have picked strong and the occasion should get the game it deserves. The World Cup is ready for this game.

"We'll both have moments when on top so it's how you capitalise on the opportunities. We know we have a quarter-final coming over the horizon and we can use this game to build momentum."

Smith takes easy catch from Weatherald as Australia lose first wicket

When you're trying to achieve something you have never managed before, help from the opposition is always welcome.

Losing wickets to loose, attacking strokes has been a market cornered by Englishmen over the past four weeks down under. 

Day one of the third Ashes Test in Adelaide - a match England must win to have any hope of coming from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series for the first time - was the day Australia's top-order batting got a touch soft, some might say Englandy.

By drinks in the evening session the hosts were 271-7 on a blameless surface - the pitch best for batting in Australia.

Six of the hosts' top seven had made double figures, only for all bar wicketkeeper Alex Carey to be dismissed.

Batter Jake Weatherald was the first to go, bounced out by the impressive Jofra Archer for 10, but he was the least guilty.

After that, Travis Head drove to cover, where Zak Crawley took a spectacular one-handed catch, to leave the score 33-2.

The worst of the dismissals came from the most unlikely source. Marnus Labuschagne, a man who prizes his wicket more than most, tamely pulled the first ball after lunch from Archer straight to mid-wicket. 

Two balls later, all-rounder Cameron Green chipped a catch straight to the same fielder. 94-2 became 94-4 with England having done little.

"With the exception of Weatherald who got an excellent ball they have given their wickets away," said BBC Test Match Special commentator Jonathan Agnew. 

"The fall of wickets have been quite cavalier and casual. 

"If that had been England throwing those wickets away I think we know what we  would have been saying."

Even Usman Khawaja, who dug in for 82 from 126 balls after being given a late call-up to replace the ill Steve Smith, gave his wicket away. 

England were toiling in the afternoon session after those two quick wickets before the left-hander slog-swept England spinner Will Jacks to deep square leg.

"Australia have been a little bit soft," said former England spinner Phil Tufnell.

"I don't know if the late withdrawal of Steve Smith panicked them a little bit. 

"The force that Smith is in that batting line-up may have got them a little jittery but England have hung in."

Carey may yet save Australia and push them towards a competitive first-innings score. 

But the average first effort on this ground this century is 396, while Australia have made 440 or more here eight times in their past 14 matches. Such a mark is still a fair way away. 

This was only the fourth time on record four of Australia's top five have been dismissed with an attacking shot on day one of a Test. 

"England have not bowled that well consistently," said former Australia bowler Glenn McGrath. "They have not bowled in consistent areas.

"They have been a bit all over the place, but they have picked up seven wickets."

England have been given a helping hand.

It has been recently reported that A football club in the Isle of Lewis has started turning an overgrown area into a new training pitch with funding from NHS Western Isles. 

Carloway Football Club said the green space, next to its main pitch, would be used for team exercises and community activities.

The health board said £22,000 in capital grant funding would help to provide a "safe and accessible" place for people of all ages.

The club said the upgraded facility would benefit junior and senior teams, including a new over 40s side.

NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson said encouraging physical activity was key to "improving health and wellbeing" in the Western Isles.

The grant money is separate from the health board's core funding for staff and patient care.

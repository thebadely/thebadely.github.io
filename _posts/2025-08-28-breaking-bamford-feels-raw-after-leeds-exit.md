It has been recently reported that Patrick Bamford also played for Nottingham Forest, Chelsea and Derby County

Patrick Bamford says he feels raw after leaving Premier League newcomers Leeds by mutual consent after seven years at the club.

Bamford scored 60 goals in 205 appearances after joining from Middlesbrough for Â£7m in 2018.

He was involved in two promotion-winning campaigns for Leeds and scored 17 goals during the club's first stint back in the Premier League under Marcelo Bielsa in 2020.

But the 31-year-old, who made one England appearance in 2021, was told by manager Daniel Farke last month that he was "not part" of his plans this season and would have to train with the under-21 squad if he remained at the club.

Speaking on Instagram, external Bamford said: "Right now, with the way it has come to an end and the way things have been handled recently it is all too raw for me to reflect on immediately. 

"But in the years to come I will look back at this period of my life with nothing but joy and pride and be super happy with what I have achieved.

"I want to thank all the managers I played under but especially Marcelo Bielsa. I don't know where the club would be without the foundations he laid."

Full-back Isaac Schmidt and winger Largie Ramazani will also spend the 2025-26 season away from the club on loan. 

Schmidt has joined Bundesliga side Werder Bremen, while Ramazani will spend the rest of the season in Spain with Valencia. 

Switzerland right-back Schmidt made 14 appearances across all competitions for Leeds last season after signing from St Gallen last summer. 

His departure comes on the back of the Whites signing full-back James Justin from Leicester City in a deal worth Â£10m.

Belgian winger Ramazani, who was part of the Manchester United youth set-up, returns to Spain having previously spent four seasons with Almeria from 2020. 

The 24-year-old scored six goals to help Leeds win the Championship last season but struggled for minutes after suffering an ankle ligament injury last October. 

Leeds have made 10 signings since their promotion, including Swiss forward Noah Okafor, England striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, midfielders Anton Stach and Sean Longstaff, Sweden left-back Gabriel Gudmundsson and centre-back Jaka Bijol.

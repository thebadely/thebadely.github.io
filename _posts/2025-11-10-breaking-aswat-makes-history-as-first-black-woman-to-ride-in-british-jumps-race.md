Here’s what you need to know: Aamilah Aswat grew up in Gloucester and first learned to ride at St James City Farm

Aamilah Aswat made history at Kempton on Monday when becoming the first black British female jump jockey to ride in Britain.

Aswat finished fifth of 10 aboard the Kim Bailey and Mat Nicholls-trained Guchen in the handicap hurdle.

The 20-year-old jockey completed the inaugural Riding A Dream Academy scholarship programme in 2021-22, after which she competed in the Magnolia Cup on the flat at Goodwood this year - following a spell at the British Racing School. 

"I can't believe that my dream to race has finally come true," said Aswat, who is based at the Bailey and Nicholls yard in Gloucestershire.

"I couldn't ask for a better horse - Guchen gave me such a great feeling and I will remember this day forever.

"I just wanted to get round safely and repay the trust that Kim and Mat have had in me.

"I am really proud to be the first black British female jump jockey. When I was growing up I looked up to Khadijah Mellah and I hope that now other young people will look up to me as well and know that they can also reach their dreams."

Mellah became the first British Muslim woman to win a horse race in Britain when victorious in the 2019 Magnolia Cup, and co-founded the academy.

"I have watched Aamilah progress over the years and I could not be more excited and proud to see her race today," said Mellah.

"Visibility is so important and I am excited for her to have the opportunity to display her talent and hard work."

Fellow academy co-founder Naomi Lawson said the organisation was aiming to "ensure that young people from diverse ethnic communities have the chance to shine in the sport".

She added: "Only around 2-3% of licensed jockeys come from these communities, far below the national average, so we hope that Aamilah is the first of many to come through the ranks and succeed."

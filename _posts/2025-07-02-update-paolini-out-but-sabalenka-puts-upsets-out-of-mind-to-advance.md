According to new developments, Aryna Sabalenka (left) is the only top-five seed remaining in the women's draw after Jasmine Paolini's second-round exit

Last year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini became the latest top-10 seed to make an early exit at Wimbledon, but world number one Aryna Sabalenka put this year's record number of upsets out of her mind in a hard-fought victory.

Italian fourth seed Paolini's 4-6 6-4 6-4 second-round defeat by Kamilla Rakhimova came after eight top-10 seeds across the men's and women's singles draws went out across the opening two days - the most at a Grand Slam in the Open era.

But Sabalenka avoided that same fate with a gritty 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win over Czech world number 48 Marie Bouzkova.

It means the only top-five seed remaining in the women's draw at the All England Club after day three of the Championships is top seed Sabalenka.

The Belarusian is aiming to add a maiden Wimbledon title to her three Grand Slam triumphs at the US and Australian Opens.

After her win, the top seed told the Centre Court crowd: "I hope it is no upsets any more in this tournament, if you know what I mean!"

Sabalenka, 27, has reached the final of both majors this year, but lost to Madison Keys at the Australian Open and Coco Gauff at the French Open.

"Honestly, it is sad to see so many upsets in the tournament in both draws," she added.

"I'm just trying to take it one step at a time. I know if I'm focused, if I'm there, if I'm fighting, I know I'm going to have my chance in each match.

"I think it's really important to focus on yourself and to take it one step at a time - do not really look at the draw.

"This is something that can create a lot of nerves and a lot of doubts."

Sabalenka will face Emma Raducanu in round three after the British number one overcame 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova later on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, American Keys breezed into the third round with a comfortable 6-4 6-2 win over Serbia's Olga Danilovic, while four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka beat Katerina Siniakova 6-3 6-2.

After a scorching couple of days at SW19, handheld fans were replaced by umbrellas on a drizzly morning which delayed play on the outside courts by almost two hours but the sun came out in time for Sabalenka's match.

The three-time major winner made tough work of the opening set, struggling to find consistency and, while not playing badly, she was not clinical in crucial moments.

Having watched three of the top five seeds fall on day two, including French Open champion Gauff, Sabalenka would have welcomed a draw that was beginning to open up.

But eye rolling and shouting in frustration at times, she could not conjure a break point in the first set and instead went down a break when she double faulted at 5-5 to hand Bouzkova the lead.

That was met with a big cheer from a Wimbledon crowd desperate to back the Czech underdog, but they were equally as animated when Sabalenka let out a huge roar as she dug deep to force the tie-break.

A more straightforward second set followed as she secured the break in the fifth game, ramping up the aggression and executing each of her signature powerful groundstrokes with a loud grunt.

Paolini reached the Wimbledon and French Open finals last year

Paolini's energetic style and personality lit up SW19 last year as she reached a second career Grand Slam final but missed out to Barbora Krejcikova.

This year she is one of 16 seeds to exit the women's draw in the opening two rounds so far.

The 29-year-old slumped to defeat on a shady Court Three, despite taking the first set with ease.

A lengthy game in set two where Russian world number 62 Rakhimova saved break points seemed to be the turning point for Paolini's downfall.

She was broken at 3-3 then could not prevent Rakhimova serving out for the set.

Unable to muster a fightback after immediately being broken in the decider, she cut a disgruntled figure as she saved three match points but went out at the fourth.

While no upsets on day three were as significant as Paolini's, more seeds tumbled out with 12th seed Diana Shnaider, Brazilian 21st seed Beatriz Haddad Maia, Croatian 22nd seed Donna Vekic and Canadian 29th seed Leylah Fernandez all heading out of the door.

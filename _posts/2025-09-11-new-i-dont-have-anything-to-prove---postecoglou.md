'Great to be back' - Ange Postecoglou unveiled as new Nottingham Forest manager

Ange Postecoglou says he doesn't "have to prove anything to anyone" as he starts his reign as Nottingham Forest's new boss.

Postecoglou was appointed on Tuesday, with the club sacking Nuno Espirito Santo late on Monday after 21 months in charge at the City Ground.

The Australian returns to management three months after he was sacked by Tottenham following a dismal Premier League season, in which they finished 17th.

However, Postecoglou ended Spurs' 17-year trophy drought by leading them to the Europa League title in May.

The 60-year-old was initially praised for the attacking style he implemented at Spurs, but he was forced to defend himself from criticism for sticking to his high-intensity principles as Spurs lost 22 of their 38 league matches last season. 

Asked if he wanted to prove doubters wrong, Postecoglou said: "I don't see it as a point to prove. I don't have to prove anything to anyone. 

"I do like my teams to play exciting football and score goals and get fans excited. I make no apologies about that, that's just the way I am."

He joked that he would find out "who the true Ange believers" are as he makes the switch from Spurs to Forest. 

Postecoglou's first game in charge will be on Saturday as Forest travel to Arsenal.

How dream relationship soured as Forest turn to Postecoglou

Tottenham endured their worst-ever Premier League campaign last term, but the win over Manchester United in the Europa League final secured Spurs' first major trophy since 2008.

It also backed up Postecoglou's claim that he always wins a trophy in his second season at a club.

He won the Australian title with both South Melbourne and Brisbane Roar and the Japanese league with Yokohama F Marinos - all in his second season or second full season in charge. He also won trophies in both of his seasons at Celtic.

Asked about his second-season promise in his first news conference as Forest boss, Postecoglou pointed out that he has also won titles in his first season at a club.

"I won the double with Celtic in my first year. I may have to [win a trophy this season] to have a second year here," he said.

"I've said already I want to win trophies and that's what I've done my whole career and that's what I want to do here."

Postecoglou explained that he didn't expect his time at Tottenham to come to an end after winning a trophy, but he said he "must have done something right".

"There is no Spurs supporter I come across now who doesn't want to hug me and take me home for dinner," he said.

"I love creating things that are lasting. Every club I've been to, I'd like to think I'd be welcome back because I left a mark."

Towards the end of his spell at Tottenham, Ange Postecoglou was embattled, despite guiding Spurs to the Europa League final.

After beating Bodo/Glimt in Norway in May, he was combative in response to questions about whether winning the competition would save Spurs' season.

Those who have worked with him feel that was down to the pressure. He dealt with it by firing back to his critics and doubters.

Fast forward to now, and the 60-year-old was relaxed in the City Ground press room, joking about how his birthday celebrations at the weekend were interrupted by negotiations with Forest and how the school run was the best motivator to return to work.

But there was the importance of winning - and winning trophies. It will not have escaped anyone's attention owner Evangelos Marinakis referenced winning trophies in his statement announcing Postecoglou's arrival.

So the pressure at Forest will be there - maybe not to the extent it was at Spurs - but he has been brought to the City Ground to progress the team and club.

Forest have not spent Â£180m this summer and installed Postecoglou in order to go backwards after last season's seventh-place finish.

While winning the Premier League is out of reach, the Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup will all be seen as legitimate targets.

Forest have not won a major trophy since lifting the League Cup in 1990.

Postecoglou has pedigree. He has won trophies throughout his career, including two Scottish titles with Celtic and the Asian Cup with Australia, and there will be an immediate expectation for Forest to challenge for silverware again.

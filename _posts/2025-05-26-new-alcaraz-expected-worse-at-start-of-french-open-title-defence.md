Let's dive into the details: Carlos Alcaraz won his first French Open title last year

Carlos Alcaraz said he "expected a worse level" from himself after beginning his French Open title defence with a straight-set victory.

Spain's four-time major winner recorded an efficient 6-3 6-4 6-2 victory over Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri in just one hour and 56 minutes.

The 22-year-old is aiming to become the first man since compatriot Rafael Nadal in 2020 to retain the Roland Garros title.

But despite winning 27 of his 29 matches on clay since May last year, Alcaraz said he did not expect such a smooth start to his campaign.

"I expected a worse level for me, honestly," world number two Alcaraz said.

"The first round for every tournament is never easy to adapt your game to the conditions and get used to it. 

"I'm just really proud about it. It is great to have these feelings in the first round."

Alcaraz won titles in Monte Carlo and Rome in the build-up to the French Open and finished runner-up to Holger Rune in Barcelona - his only loss in 16 clay-court matches in 2025. 

But those performances followed a surprise opening loss to David Goffin at the Miami Open in March, with victory at the Rotterdam Open his only success on hard courts this year.

Discussing his form this season, Alcaraz said: "We all know the rollercoaster that has so far been this year for me - making really good results, then losing the first round.

"But right now I think I found a really good path again. I think I'm just starting to get it, feeling more comfortable approaching the matches. 

"Once I start the matches, I think I'm just keeping the high level in the whole match and during the whole tournament. "

Alcaraz, who now holds a 19-3 record at the French Open, plays Hungarian Fabian Marozsan in the second round.

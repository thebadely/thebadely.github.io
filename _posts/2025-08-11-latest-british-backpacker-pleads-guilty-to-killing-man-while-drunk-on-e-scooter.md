Experts revealed that A British backpacker has pleaded guilty to killing a man in Australia after hitting him while riding an e-scooter with an alcohol level more than three times the legal limit.

Alicia Kemp, 25, had been drinking with a friend on a Saturday afternoon in May when she was kicked out of a bar because the two of them were drunk, the court heard earlier.

The pair hired an e-scooter in the evening, and Kemp was driving at speeds of 20 to 25km/h (12 to 15mph) when she hit 51-year-old Thanh Phan from behind on a pavement in Perth's city centre.

The father-of-two hit his head on the pavement and died in hospital from a brain bleed two days later.

Kemp's passenger was also hurt in the crash - sustaining a fractured skull and broken nose - but her injuries were not life-threatening. 

In Perth's Magistrates Court on Monday, Kemp - appearing via video link - pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing death while intoxicated. The charge carries a maximum 20-year prison term. 

Prosecutors dropped a second charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm to her passenger.

Earlier, the court heard that Kemp's blood alcohol content level was 0.158 after the crash, more than three times the legal limit of 0.05 in Australia. 

Prosecutors said CCTV footage showed Kemp's "inexplicably dangerous" riding before she struck Mr Phan, who was waiting to cross the road. 

In a statement from Mr Phan's family earlier this year, the structural engineer was described as a beloved husband, father, brother and dear friend.

Kemp's lawyer Michael Tudori said she was relieved after pleading guilty and hoped to be sentenced before Christmas, according to local media.

"You could see she was ready to say those words, you know, she's obviously done something stupid," Mr Tudori told the ABC.

Kemp, who was in Western Australia on a working holiday visa, will remain in custody until her sentencing.

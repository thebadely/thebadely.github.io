It has been recently reported that Pirlo won two Champions League and six Serie A titles as a player

Italy legend Andrea Pirlo has been appointed manager of Dubai-based United FC.

It will be the 46-year-old's fourth club in five years since he took charge of Juventus in 2020.

Pirlo won the Coppa Italia and Italian Super Cup after replacing Maurizio Sarri in Turin, but was sacked by Juve at the end of the season after they finished fourth in Serie A.

He also lasted less than a year at Turkish side Fatih Karagumruk and had 14 months with Sampdoria before departing in August 2024.

United FC, also known as Dubai United, compete in the second tier of football in the United Arab Emirates, below the Pro-League.

Pirlo has reportedly signed a two-year contract with the club who said: "Pirlo brings with him a unique footballing vision and valuable coaching experience. 

"His arrival marks an exciting new chapter for United FC and reflects the club's growing ambition in the UAE football landscape."

As a player, Pirlo won major trophies with AC Milan and Juventus and lifted the 2006 World Cup with Italy, before the midfielder retired in 2017 after a spell with New York City.

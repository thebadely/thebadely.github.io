Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kate Cross has taken three wickets in four ODIs this summer, averaging 55.00

Kate Cross has been left out of England's squad for the Women's World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, but batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge and leg-spinner Sarah Glenn have been recalled.

Former captain Heather Knight, who has been recovering from a hamstring injury since the end of May, is also included. 

Seamer Cross is one of England's most experienced bowlers in one-day internationals, with 101 wickets in 76 matches, but she has struggled for form since suffering a back injury at the end of 2024. 

The 33-year-old was injured during England's tour of South Africa in December, and was subsequently included in the Ashes squad but did not play a game during the disastrous 16-0 thrashing in Australia. 

Cross has played four ODIs this summer, three against West Indies and one against India, but only took three wickets at an average of 55. 

The World Cup starts on 30 September, with England's first match against South Africa taking place on 3 October in Bengaluru. 

Australia are defending their title after they beat England in the 2022 final.

England squad for the ICC Women's World Cup: Em Arlott, Tammy Beaumont, Lauren Bell, Alice Capsey, Charlie Dean, Sophia Dunkley, Sophie Ecclestone, Lauren Filer, Sarah Glenn, Amy Jones, Heather Knight, Emma Lamb, Nat Sciver-Brunt (captain), Linsey Smith, Danni Wyatt-Hodge.

India defeats were not 'reality check' - Edwards

It has been a tumultuous year for England, who were knocked out of the T20 World Cup last November by West Indies before the Ashes defeat led to a complete overhaul with Nat Sciver-Brunt replacing Knight as captain, and former skipper Charlotte Edwards taking over as coach from Jon Lewis. 

Edwards' era started with a clean sweep over a poor West Indies side but weaknesses were exposed against a strong India who won both the T20 and ODI series. 

But this is her first major assignment, with England underdogs going into the tournament, where co-hosts India and serial winners Australia are the favourites.

Wyatt-Hodge provides more experience in the batting line-up after she missed out on both series this summer, while Knight's return is a significant boost to a struggling middle order. 

Edwards told the BBC Stumped podcast that she expects Sciver-Brunt to bowl during the World Cup after her recovery from an Achilles problem, which helps balance the side with an extra batter. 

Glenn forms a strong and varied spin attack with left-armers Sophie Ecclestone and Linsey Smith alongside off-spinner Charlie Dean, while Alice Capsey offers another part-time option on surfaces expected to favour slow bowling.

Lauren Bell leads the seam attack alongside Em Arlott, who made her debut this summer, and Lauren Filer provides extra pace. 

"Like all global tournaments, it will be a huge challenge but we want to go as far as we possibly can in India and I believe that if we play our best cricket we can compete with anyone," Edwards said.

"Conditions mean we have gone for the extra spinner and we're lucky to be able to have such depth in this department.

"It's great to have Danni back in the squad. She's been in good form in domestic cricket and she'll bring dynamism and depth to our batting, alongside Heather, who we are absolutely delighted to be able to select. She'll be a huge asset for us.

"India and Sri Lanka are amazing places to play cricket, and as a group we have a huge opportunity to go and do something special."

Let's dive into the details: Nikola Jokic recorded the 176th triple-double of his career

Nikola Jokic recorded a 56-point triple-double and broke a record set by Steph Curry as the Denver Nuggets beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 142-138 on Christmas Day.

The Serb hit 56 points, recorded 16 rebounds and 15 assists - becoming the first player in NBA history to hit at least 55 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a triple-double. 

Three-time MVP Jokic hit 18 of his 56 points in overtime, breaking Curry's record of 17 overtime points from 2016.

The Timberwolves took the game in Denver to overtime after clawing back a 15-point deficit in the final five minutes of the game. 

Anthony Edwards top-scored for the Timberwolves with 44 points, including the game-tying three that took the game to overtime. 

But the 24-year-old was ejected in the extra period for arguing over foul calls as the Nuggets claimed the win. 

The Nuggets are third in the Western Conference, with the Timberwolves in fifth.

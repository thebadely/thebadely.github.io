It has been recently reported that The cost of school uniform and PE kits is "extortionate" and "ridiculous", according to parents in Hull.

A poll by The Children's Society charity said 38% of parents in the Yorkshire and Humber region and 37% in the East Midlands are struggling to afford mandatory uniform and PE kit.

Karyssa Bates from Hull, who has four children, said she starts saving at Christmas to afford uniform for the following academic year which she described as "difficult".

The Department for Education (DfE) said it was changing the law to limit the number of branded items schools can insist on. 

A spokesperson added: "Our Plan for Change is removing barriers to opportunity, with limits on branded items of school uniform just one of the steps we're taking to put money back into parents' pockets and break the link between background and success."

The average cost of a school uniform is just over £340 for primary school children and around £454 for those in secondary education, according to DfE figures.

Ms Bates added: "It is difficult to be able to afford to get all brand new uniforms because they grow so quickly.

"Every year they need new uniform and sometimes they need more than one pair of shoes throughout the year."

Alex Fenwick said branded uniform for her daughter, who is starting secondary school, cost around £150. In addition to the branded items, Ms Fenwick also needs to buy shirts, shoes and a bag.

Ms Fenwick, who is disabled and receives benefits, told the BBC she had to ask her parents for financial help as "everything is so tight, I just can't afford it."

Michael Morris, the founder of a health and well-being charity in Lincolnshire, runs a uniform swap-shop from Boston Youth Hub which launched after he noticed finances were "very tight for a lot of people".

He said: "The idea is for a lot of the kids they grow out of their uniforms but they're still in good order.

"So why not repurpose them? Rather than going to landfill, we can reuse them and other families can make good use of them."

"Being able to have something like this means it's easier for them [families] and means they've hopefully got a few more pennies at the end of the month."

Hull City Council, East Riding of Yorkshire Council and North Lincolnshire Council offer grants to help parents to cover the cost of school clothing.

Councillor Jack Haines, the portfolio holder for communications and policy delivery at Hull City Council, said: "This new investment has seen support for over 2,600 pupils across the city, with more to come this year.

"We are now keen to see the government push through the planned changes to the school uniform policies in England under the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill that would ease the pressure further for families."

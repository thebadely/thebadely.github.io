It has been recently reported that A headteacher said people's generosity was "mind-blowing" after enough funds were raised to make a Christmas hamper for every child at her school. 

Pupils at West Earlham Infant and Nursery School in Norwich will each be gifted a mixture of books, toys, hygiene products, chocolates, coats and scarves. 

The fundraising was spearheaded by former teaching assistant Annie Jennings and personal trainer Lewis Wardale, who raised more than £4,000 to create 280 hampers. 

Headteacher Jade Hunter said: "Cost of living is hard for so many people, but there is so much generosity and goodwill out there that I haven't encountered anything like this before. I have been genuinely speechless at times." 

Ms Jennings wanted to raise money and collect donations to treat the children and asked Mr Wardale if he wanted to get involved. 

He said: "I did some previous fundraising before... I know the power of the community and coming together for a good cause.

"It has surprised me. I think the world can be quite negative right now. I know the people of Norwich are really good, and when there's a good cause, people really back it." 

Ms Hunter said initially they were hoping to make the hampers for a few families who had been identified as needing extra support. 

However, as the project progressed, they set their sights higher to be able to make enough for each child. 

She said: "We know that the cost of living is really hitting all families, but particularly the families on a fixed income... it is always nice to be able to lighten the load for families.

"To know every child and family in the school will be touched by this is such a lovely thing to do.

"It's really nice to be able to do a school-wide offer that's just for everyone. No stigma. No strings."

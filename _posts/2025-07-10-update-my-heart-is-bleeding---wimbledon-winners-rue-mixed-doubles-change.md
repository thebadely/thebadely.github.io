According to new developments, Sem Verbeek and Katerina Siniakova beat Joe Salisbury and Luisa Stefani in the Wimbledon mixed doubles final

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Wimbledon mixed doubles champion Sem Verbeek says his "heart is bleeding" over a change in format at the US Open that means he and partner Katerina Siniakova will be unable to play there together.

The duo beat Britain's Joe Salisbury and Brazilian partner Luisa Stefani 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-3) in the final on Centre Court on Thursday.

The US Open will hold its mixed doubles competition as a standalone event before the start of the Slam from this year onwards in an attempt to attract top singles players to participate.

Several eye-catching partnerships have been announced for the new-look event, including British number one Emma Raducanu teaming up with two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.

But it means the vast majority of doubles specialists will miss out on playing in the mixed competition in New York.

"It's a shame they decided to do it," Czech Siniakova, the world number one in women's doubles, told BBC Sport. 

"I think it's a marketing step, but they are taking [away the] chance of doubles players."

Dutchman Verbeek agreed, adding: "As two athletes that would love to play it, it's a shame to obviously know that we can't.

"I'm not going to actively root against it for it not to be a success. The positive I can think of is that there's going to be more people that can see the top single stars earlier in the tournament when they are maybe a bit more accessible to the public.

"But as a doubles athlete, my heart is bleeding."

Britain's Salisbury missed out on a maiden Wimbledon title as he and Brazilian partner Stefani were beaten on a blustery Centre Court. 

It means Wimbledon remains the only title missing from Salisbury's illustrious career.

The 33-year-old has twice reached the mixed doubles final at Wimbledon, having previously done so alongside compatriot Harriet Dart in 2021, but has suffered defeat in both.

After a tight opening set where the duos could not be separated, Verbeek and Siniakova rapidly took a 5-1 lead in the tie-break.

Two brilliant rallies offered Salisbury and Stefani a glimmer of hope but the damage had already been done, and Stefani's volley dropped long to hand Verbeek and Siniakova the opener.

A break of serve apiece in the second set teed up another tie-break, and Siniakova showed why she is a 10-time major doubles champion with clever net play and confident volleys.

The 29-year-old's overhead smash sealed victory for the pair and Verbeek picked up his partner and hugged her before leading the crowd in singing 'happy birthday' to his father.

It is a maiden major title for Verbeek and a first Grand Slam mixed doubles triumph for Siniakova.

Salisbury has won the French and US Opens in the mixed alongside American Desirae Krawczyk and US and Australian titles in the men's alongside American Rajeev Ram.

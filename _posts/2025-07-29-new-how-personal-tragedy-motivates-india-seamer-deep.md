Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Akash Deep took his maiden Test five-wicket haul in the Edgbaston Test

"Why didn't you tell Siraj to bowl outside the off stump so that you could take five wickets?"

That's what Bengal team-mate Shreevats Goswami jokingly asked Akash Deep after the first innings of the second England versus India Test.

"No, no, whatever the team requires, we have to do that," Deep replied.

The right-arm pacer, who had featured in just seven Tests for India before, eventually claimed a five-wicket haul in the second innings, helping India seal an impressive win.

Deep stepped up in style, even earning praise from England captain Ben Stokes for "his ability to use and change his angles consistently and still be so accurate".

While Deep's name only began resonating in cricket circles after his 10 wickets at Edgbaston, his story stretches far deeper.

Born in a small village in Bihar, one of India's most economically challenged states, Akash grew up believing cricket was a game for the wealthy. It was his childhood friend Vaibhav Kumar who first instilled belief in him.

"Cricket wasn't very popular in Bihar back then. In our entire district, barely 20 to 25 people were playing leather-ball cricket," Vaibhav says. 

"Akash mostly played with a tennis ball, but whenever we took him along for a leather-ball match, he would always help us win. But Akash thought that only the rich could play cricket."

Vaibhav, a cricketer himself, became convinced of Deep's talent after watching professional players up close.

"We went to Jamshedpur, where a few Ranji Trophy and IPL players were playing in an academy. When I saw them bowling, I was like 'Akash is faster and better than them'," he recalls.

"I asked the coaches there to take a look at him, and they were impressed too. They said if not India, Akash could definitely play IPL as long as he works hard."

But before Deep could fully commit to the sport, tragedy struck. His father died in 2015, followed by his elder brother just six months later.

With no primary breadwinner in the family, cricket was put on hold.

"He bought a dumper on partnership after saving some money from farming and used it to earn a living. His mother also received half of her late husband's salary, which helped the family get by," Vaibhav says.

Deep left the game for nearly three years, but his passion for cricket never fully disappeared. Determined to chase his dream, he decided to relocate to Bengal.

"My father was posted in Bengal, and we decided to rent a flat there. I went to different clubs and asked them to consider Akash, but they would make fun of me," Vaibhav says.

"But I didn't give up and requested one of the coaches multiple times to take a look at him just once. After seeing him, they agreed to play him."

That proved to be the turning point. Deep soon began playing in Bengal's domestic circuit and was quickly noticed.

"He was on the fringes. But it was pretty evident that he was an exceptional talent. He had a lot of strength, good pace, and a natural ability to swing the ball. So, we brought him into the team and he did exceedingly well," says former India cricketer Arun Lal, then Bengal's coach.

"He was so good that I am rather disappointed that it has taken him so long to surface on the international stage."

But talent alone wasn't enough. Arun had to work on Akash's mindset.

"He underestimated himself. So the idea was to work on his temperament rather than technique and try to get him to believe in himself," Arun says.

His domestic performances eventually earned him a spot in the IPL, and soon after, in India's Test squad. Deep made his international debut in early 2024 against England, picking up three wickets.

It seemed his fortunes had finally turned. But more hardship was around the corner.

"His sister was diagnosed with cancer. He went through a lot of stress and would even turn his phone off. He was feeling mentally down since he had already lost his father and brother. But thankfully, she is fine now," Vaibhav says.

Deep later dedicated his performance at Edgbaston to his sister.

"Every time I picked up the ball, her thoughts and picture crossed my mind. This performance is dedicated to her. I want to tell her, 'Sis, we are all with you.'"

After Edgbaston, Deep struggled at Lord's and missed the Old Trafford Test through injury, but his absence was felt as his replacement, Anshul Kamboj, struggled to adapt to English conditions.

His return to the team cannot come quickly enough.

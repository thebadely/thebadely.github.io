It has been recently reported that Mason Greenwood joined Marseille from Manchester United for Â£26.6m in July 2024

England boss Thomas Tuchel says he has not spoken to former Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood and the player was "not in our thoughts".

Greenwood, 23, left United after charges against him, including attempted rape and assault, were dropped in February 2023.

He joined Spanish club Getafe on loan and then, in 2024, signed for Marseille on a permanent basis where he has scored 23 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions.

Greenwood, whose solitary England cap came in a Nations League match away to Iceland in September 2020, had started the process of changing his allegiance to Jamaica.

He obtained a Jamaican passport but has not completed the requisite change of association form as he was not ready to commit to the Caribbean nation.

That frustrated Jamaica coach Steve McClaren and Tuchel has now dismissed the idea of an England return.

"I have not spoken to him until now. I have not spoken to him or his camp," the Three Lions boss told a news conference.

"My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought. He was not in the mix at the moment and he is not in our thoughts for our team."

McClaren wanted to include Greenwood in his squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago, but then reported "he's not going to commit at this time to anybody".

On Greenwood's international future, the former England boss added: "He [Greenwood] is taking his time over that, so it's a little bit disappointing. We probably have to be more patient.  

"But we will keep the contact, we will keep pursuing him because I know from my conversations with Mason and his family that he loves Jamaica, respects Jamaica.

"He wants to concentrate on club football and not commit to an international team at the present moment. We have to respect that, however much we've worked hard to get him here for these camps. So, who knows in the future."

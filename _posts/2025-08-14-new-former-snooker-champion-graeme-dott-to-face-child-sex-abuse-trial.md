Experts revealed that Former world snooker champion Graeme Dott is to stand trial charged with child sex abuse.

The 48-year-old Scot is accused of lewd and libidinous behaviour towards two children between 1993 and 2010.

The allegations include claims he inappropriately touched a girl, instructed her to remove her clothes and exposed himself to her, as well as molesting a boy, making sexual remarks and watching him shower.

Dott, who won the world title in 2006, has pled not guilty to the charges.

A trial has been scheduled for next year. 

Both charges state the alleged incidents occurred on "various occasions", at addresses in the east end of Glasgow, South Lanarkshire and in a car.

The case called for a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow, where the attendance of Dott was excused.

His lawyer Euan Dow told the hearing there was one defence witness listed, but there could potentially be more.

Mr Dow told the court that his client was not currently ready for trial, but asked for a date to be set.

Lord Mulholland confirmed a five-day trial would begin on 17 August 2026. 

Dott remains on bail. 

He was suspended by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association when the charges were announced earlier this year.

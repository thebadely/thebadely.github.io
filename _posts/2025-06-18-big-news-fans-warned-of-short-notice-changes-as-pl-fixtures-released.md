It has been recently reported that Liverpool will start their bid for a third league title in seven seasons

Fans have been warned by the Premier League that fixtures could be moved at "relatively short notice" next season because of the number of teams playing in Europe.

A record nine top-flight clubs have qualified for Uefa competitions in the 2025-26 campaign.

The Premier League said there is an "increased likelihood" that games will be rescheduled if English teams reach the latter stages, and it suggested fans take this into consideration when planning their attendance at games.

Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham will be playing in the Champions League next season.

Aston Villa and Crystal Palace have qualified for the Europa League, while Nottingham Forest will be playing in the Conference League.

"While the Premier League celebrates this success, it will come with an impact on the scheduling of league matches," a statement from the Premier League said.

"There is an increased likelihood of Premier League fixtures moving at relatively short notice, after our fixture announcements, should our clubs progress to the knockout rounds of these competitions."

The warning comes after the Premier League announced the fixture list for the 2025-26 season on Wednesday.

Champions Liverpool will host Bournemouth in the Friday night curtain-raiser, while Manchester United will play Arsenal in the opening weekend's standout fixture at Old Trafford.

How are Premier League fixtures decided?

When are Premier League TV picks announced?

Liverpool, who won the league in Arne Slot's first season in charge, will begin their title defence at Anfield on Friday, 15 August.

Newly promoted Sunderland, back in the top flight for the first time since 2016-17, start their campaign at home against West Ham the following day.

Championship winners Leeds welcome Everton to Elland Road for the Monday night game, while Burnley - promoted back to the top flight at the first time of asking - travel to Europa League holders Tottenham, who will be led by Thomas Frank in a league match for the first time.

Everton fans will have to wait until the second round of fixtures for their first league game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, when they will face Brighton.

Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will hope to bounce back from a rare trophyless season with a strong start against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux.

The season, which consists of 380 games over 33 weekends and five midweek rounds, will conclude on Sunday, 24 May.

The Premier League has said the start date of 15 August - 82 days on from the end of the 2024-25 season - "allows for the maximum player rest time available".

During the festive period, clubs will not be asked to play twice in less than 48 hours.

While there are currently no games listed for 26 December, some may be moved to Boxing Day - depending on the live broadcast selection.

The African Cup of Nations will take place in Morocco from 21 December to 18 January, meaning some clubs will be without players for six Premier League match weeks.

Just 18 days after the season ends, the 2026 World Cup will begin in the US, Canada and Mexico.

It will be the first season with the new Premier League TV deal in place, with every game outside of the Saturday 3pm blackout to be broadcast live by either Sky Sports or TNT Sports.

Data from Opta shows the difficulty of every team's first five fixtures.

According to their 'power rankings' data, Manchester United have the hardest start as they play three of last season's top four in their opening five games.

Arsenal, who will be looking to improve on their three consecutive second-place finishes, are perceived to have the next toughest start - with games against holders Liverpool and Manchester City, who had won the previous four titles.

Unai Emery's Aston Villa are said to have the easiest start of the the campaign, despite facing Champions League qualifiers Newcastle in their first match.

Leeds have been judged to have been handed the toughest opening run of the three promoted sides, with games against Arsenal and Newcastle.

The devil can sometimes be in the detail with a set of fixtures.

For instance, how will England boss Thomas Tuchel feel when he realises Liverpool must play Arsenal at home, Chelsea away and then old rivals Manchester City away from home immediately before the international windows in September, October and November.

The Premier League confirmed within their fixtures announcement that, with nine teams in Europe - and six in the Champions League - "there is an increased likelihood of Premier League fixtures moving at relatively short notice, after our fixture announcements, should our clubs progress to the knockout rounds of these competitions".

But before that, there may need to be some juggling when the first expanded lot of TV fixtures come out as, when they do, either later this month or early in July, no-one will know which of England's Champions League representatives will be playing on a Tuesday - and therefore cannot play in a coveted Sunday TV slot on the previous weekend.

Manchester City will play at home before five of their first six Champions League matches, but face four away fixtures directly after - which can be irritating for managers after a long midweek away trip.

Chelsea have five away games before that first half a dozen Champions League games, which can be irritating for managers after a long midweek away trip (basically managers like to moan), but do have five at home after.

Manchester United's form last season might not make this the test it once was but they go to the Emirates in the single weekend between matchdays seven and eight, so Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta might hope qualification from the league stage is relatively secure by then.

Arteta will presumably be interested to discover their matchday five European opponents, given that will fall in between a north London derby with Tottenham and an equally high-octane trip to Chelsea.

Newcastle and Manchester City have trips to Manchester United and Nottingham Forest respectively in the 27 December fixtures - although it will be the late kick-off, when it comes, that will really cause a furore.

And the holiday season is well and truly over for the Premier League by 3 January - given long trips for Burnley, Crystal Palace, Sunderland, Brentford and Chelsea have been confirmed.

Manchester City new-boy Rayan Cherki will not have to wait long to get a chance to execute his stated wish to "kill" Manchester United, following their epic Europa League victory over his old club Lyon. Ruben Amorim's side go to Etihad Stadium on 13 September.

Amorim has said he will start the 2025-26 season under huge pressure. The Premier League has given him Arsenal, City and Chelsea in the first five games.

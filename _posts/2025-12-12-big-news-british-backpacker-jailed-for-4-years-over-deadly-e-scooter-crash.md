According to new developments, A British backpacker who struck and killed a man while riding an e-scooter drunk has been jailed for four years in Australia.

Alicia Kemp, 25 - from Redditch, Worcestershire - was driving at speeds of 20 to 25km/h (12 to 15mph) when she hit 51-year-old Thanh Phan from behind on a Perth sidewalk in May.

She had been drinking with a friend all afternoon, the court heard, and had an alcohol level more than three times the legal limit.

Phan, a father-of-two, hit his head on the pavement and died in hospital from a brain bleed two days later.

A friend of Kemp, who was a passenger on the scooter, was also hurt in the crash - sustaining a fractured skull and broken nose - but her injuries were not life-threatening.

Kemp, who was in Australia on a working holiday visa, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing death in the Perth Magistrates Court in August.

"You, Miss Kemp, are the cautionary tale," Judge Wendy Hughes said in her sentencing on Friday.

"E-scooters are not toys."

Kemp's sentence will be backdated to 1 June, and she'll be eligible for parole after serving two years of her sentence. Her driver's licence was also disqualified for two years.

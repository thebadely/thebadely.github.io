Here’s what you need to know: Bath, who won the European Cup in 1998, finished top of Pool 2 with three wins

English champions Bath will host Saracens in the last 16 of the Investec Champions Cup, while Harlequins' reward for a stunning away win over La Rochelle is a home tie against Sale Sharks.

Bath scored nine tries against Edinburgh at the Rec on Friday night to finish as Pool 2 winners and qualify as fourth seeds for the knockout stage.

Quins' victory kept Leicester Tigers in the competition - and they face the tough task of trying to topple champions and top seeds Bordeaux at Stade Chaban-Delmas.

Second seeds Glasgow Warriors outclassed Saracens on Sunday to complete a clean sweep of bonus-point wins and will face South African side Bulls.

Third seeds Leinster welcome Edinburgh while six-time winners Toulouse, who lead the Top 14 but lost two of their pool games, welcome Bristol Bears.

Northampton Saints host Castres, while United Rugby Championship table-toppers Stormers will travel to Toulon.

The last 16 is comprised of seven English teams, four from France, two from Scotland and South Africa and one from Ireland.

Ties will be played from 3-5 April.

Historically, earning home advantage for as far into the competition as possible gives the best chance of winning it.

Holders Bordeaux, who again top the seedings after four bonus-point wins, reached the final with three comfortable knockout wins last year.

They have continued their fine European form and once again look to be the side to beat.

Leinster have not lost a pool game since 2018 and despite not being at their imperious best, continued their unbeaten record at this stage.

However, as Glasgow Warriors picked up more bonus points, it leaves Leinster in an unfamiliar position of potentially travelling away from Dublin in the semi-finals.

Based on seedings that would be to Glasgow, which both sides may prefer rather than a French side.

Bath topped Pool 2 but because of a defeat by Toulon know they face an away trip to Bordeaux in the semi-finals if results match the knockout seedings.

Away knockout wins do happen, with Northampton winning in Dublin in last year's semi-final and Munster winning a last-16 tie in La Rochelle examples of just that.

But as the next two rounds are played on back-to-back weekends in April, it means a high seeding is more than likely required to reach the semi-finals and beyond.

Antoine Dupont's Toulouse lost to Glasgow and Saracens but still managed to finish second in Pool 1 and will be one side who could rip up the seedings script, eyeing up a potential game with Bordeaux earlier than expected.

Stormers, who paid the price for sending a weakened side to Harlequins, have a tough first knockout game against Toulon.

The South African outfit have only lost once this season and will fancy the challenge of trying to secure an away win, before potentially heading to Glasgow.

Northampton Saints have a home last-16 tie against Castres and after reaching last year's final will not be afraid of travelling away deep in the competition.

Victory would result in an all-English quarter-final against Bath or Saracens, leaving a Prem team guaranteed a semi-final spot.

Harlequins' surprise win over La Rochelle has left Ronan O'Gara's side with a Challenge Cup last-16 tie away to Newcastle Red Bulls.

Exeter Chiefs host Munster, who also drop down from the Champions Cup.

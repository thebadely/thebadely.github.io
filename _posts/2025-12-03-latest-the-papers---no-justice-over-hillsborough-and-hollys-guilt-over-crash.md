Experts revealed that Photos of all 97 victims of the Hillsborough disaster feature on the front page of the i paper, after the publication of what the Times calls a "damning" report on the police's actions during the stadium crush. 

The Daily Mirror says it confirms what families "have feared all along": that nobody will face justice. The paper claims that officers, criticised for their failures, have been allowed to simply "walk away". One woman whose son was killed in the tragedy is quoted in the Guardian as saying: "How lucky they are to grow old".

A Reform UK donor tells the Financial Times that Nigel Farage has said he expects the party to either make a deal or merge with the Conservatives before the next election. The unnamed donor says the move would be aimed at "easing Reform's route to victory". But Farage tells the paper that he would never do a deal with a party he does not trust, adding that a deal with the Tories "as they are" would cost his party votes.

According to the Daily Telegraph, the top civil servant at the Treasury has been dragged into the row over whether the chancellor misled the public about the state of the UK's finances. It reports that James Bowler "approved the publication of a letter that showed Rachel Reeves knew the financial hole was smaller than previously thought". An MP on the Treasury Select Committee tells the paper he was "probably uncomfortable with the way the political team were leaking stuff". But Treasury insiders deny any split, and insist Reeves approved the letter's release.

The Daily Mail says that following what it calls Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's "rent scandal", Pandora's box has been opened, with a new investigation into homes owned by the Crown Estate. The paper says the probe will scrutinise the deal on the Prince and Princess of Wales's new family home in Windsor Great Park.

And the Sun says that England fans are being "clobbered" with "the most expensive World Cup tickets ever seen". The paper says Fifa has "grabbed a share of the resale market", taking a 15% cut from both the buyer and the seller. According to the report, tickets are already going for £1,000, with some listed for nearly £33,000.

Experts revealed that Boiling Point edged out Indalo by the finest of margins to win the Cambridgeshire at Newmarket.

Jockey Clifford Lee, trainer Karl Burke and owner Sheikh Mohammed Obaid joined forces to clinch a second consecutive victory in the heritage handicap after winning it last year with Liberty Lane. 

Lee moved 14-1 chance Boiling Point to the head of the field and then somehow managed to hold off a late charge from Indalo (20-1) to take the photo finish by a nose.

Fort George came in third of the 23-strong field, at 11-2, while Erzindjan (28-1) was fourth.  

Both Boiling Point and Liberty Lane before him won the gallop over one mile and one furlong at top weight. 

"It was a great performance," winning trainer Burke told ITV Sport. 

"Cliff is so good from the front. You never worry about him going forward on a horse. He always gets his fractions right, but then you need the horse underneath you and it was a great performance. 

"I think he was on fresh air the last 100 yards and I actually thought he got chinned on the line, but fantastic."

Earlier, in the two Group One races at Newmarket, 11-8 favourite Wise Approach stumbled out of the gates in the Middle Park Stakes but recovered to beat Brussels (9-1) into second place, while 2-1 favourite True Love won the Cheveley Park Stakes.

It has been recently reported that Louis Rees-Zammit had initially targeted a hybrid role as a running back and wide receiver in the NFL

Louis Rees-Zammit is leaving the NFL to return to playing rugby union.

The decision comes 18 months after the 24-year-old initially quit rugby to pursue a career playing American football.

Rees-Zammit had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars, but never played a snap in a regular-season game.

"I've decided to leave the NFL and return to rugby," wrote Rees-Zammit in a social media post.

"It's been a great experience, but it's time to come home. I've decided that this is the best time to make this decision to give myself time to get everything in place for next season.

"There's only one thing that's on my mind, that's coming back to rugby and doing what I do best.

"I can't explain how excited I am."

Rees-Zammit re-signs as wide receiver for Jaguars

After participating in the NFL's International Player Pathway (IPP), Rees-Zammit was initially signed to the Kansas City Chiefs, but was cut after failing to impress during pre-season appearances in 2024.

Rees-Zammit then joined the Jacksonville Jaguars, where he spent the entire 2024 season as part of the franchise's practice squad.

Despite being eligible for elevation to the Jaguars' active 53-man roster on two occasions as part of the NFL's IPP player rules, the Jaguars never opted to elevate Rees-Zammit, including at both of their international games in London.

The Welshman temporarily left the franchise at the end of the 2024 season, but was soon re-signed as part of the expanded off-season roster.

Reports out of the Jaguars' training camp in July suggested Rees-Zammit had missed training with a lower back injury, and his future with the franchise was placed in doubt.

And on Thursday, Rees-Zammit announced his decision to leave the NFL and return to rugby.

Before leaving rugby union in January 2024, Rees-Zammit had won 32 caps for Wales.

His former club, Gloucester, return to Premiership action on 25 September, while the United Rugby Championship season starts the following day.

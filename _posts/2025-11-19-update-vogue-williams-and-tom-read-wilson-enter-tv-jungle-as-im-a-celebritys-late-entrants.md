According to new developments, Irish TV presenter Vogue Williams and Celebs Go Dating receptionist Tom Read Wilson are to join I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Here!

The late entrants were revealed on Wednesday night's instalment of the ITV show, and will be shown entering the camp on Thursday's episode.

Williams said taking part in the series was a "massive life experience", adding that she doesn't normally go "out of my comfort zone".

Read Wilson said he initially felt "abject terror" about taking part but is now "feeling excited" about entering the Australian jungle.

The pair join fellow campmates, including Martin Kemp, Ruby Wax, Jack Osbourne and Kelly Brook, who have been in the jungle since the show's launch on Sunday.

Williams, who is married to former Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, said: "I always thought I wouldn't do it, because I've gotten too comfortable in my life. I like to have eight hours of sleep, I like to eat nice things, I like to just chill out and I never put myself out of my comfort zone.

"Then when I turned 40, I started to get scared of ridiculous things. I didn't want to be this person. Doing this is such a massive life experience and it is not something you can pay to do.

"So now I am 40, I think it will be pretty cool to do I'm A Celebrity."

The mother-of-three said she was "very worried about missing the kids" while in camp.

"I have never been away this long before and I spend such a huge amount of time with them," she explained. "It will be my biggest struggle."

Read Wilson, who was also a contestant on the fifth series of The Voice UK in 2016 and then runner-up on Celebrity Best Home Cook in 2021, said he was "feeling excited" about entering the jungle.

"My first thought when they approached me about taking part was abject terror," said the 39-year-old. "But I have got a very strict rule in life. If the only reason that you don't want to do it is fear, you must do it, whatever it is.

"I'm fearful as a porcupine and I am very nervous that my grey cells [brains] won't dance properly in camp, too. At home, I do a cryptic crossword every day, I always have a book on the go and I am a bit worried that my frontal lobes will drop off if I don't have a lubricant for it."

He continued: "I can be vague at times and I don't want to scatter brain cells over the camp."

His role as a receptionist and client coordinator on Celebs Go Dating sees him greet the celebrities upon their arrival to the dating agency.

He is also well known for his wide vocabulary and published a book about language in 2022.

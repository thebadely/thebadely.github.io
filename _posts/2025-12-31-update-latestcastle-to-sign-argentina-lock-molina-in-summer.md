Experts revealed that Franco Molina has 20 international caps for Argentina

Newcastle Red Bulls have signed Argentina international lock Franco Molina for the start of the 2026-27 season.

The 28-year-old second row will join up with the Newcastle squad in the summer after playing the 2026 Super Rugby campaign for Australian side Western Force.

Molina, who has experience of Prem rugby after making 17 appearances for Exeter Chiefs last season, has agreed a two-year deal.

He has 20 international caps and previously had club spells in Argentina with Dogos, Ceibos and Jaguares, as well as Chilean side Selknam.

"I'm incredibly honoured to be joining Newcastle Red Bulls - a club that has such a rich affinity with Argentinian players," Molina told the Newcastle club website, external.

"After my conversation with Jonny Petrie [managing director] and Neil McIlroy [sporting general manager] it is obvious that this is a really exciting time to be involved with the club, and I cannot wait for what is to come.

"I'm looking forward to meeting my team-mates and achieving something special there."

Manager McIlroy said Molina had built up valuable international experience in recent years by playing in "many big games" for Argentina.

"He knows the Prem from his time with Exeter, and his set-piece ability will stand us in good stead as we look to put this club on a clear upward trajectory," said McIlroy.

Newcastle are currently bottom of the Prem after losing all eight of their league matches so far this season and host second-from-bottom Gloucester on Friday.

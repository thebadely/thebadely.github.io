Let's dive into the details: This video can not be played

Liverpool score twice late on to win after Bournemouth fightback

Hugo Ekitike was Liverpool's headline act on a night of pure theatre at Anfield which was high on emotion and rich in thrilling drama, but was also played out under the shadow of allegations of racist abuse.

Ekitike might face a future fight for his place only weeks after making a Â£70m from Eintracht Frankfurt, with Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak still on Liverpool's agenda - but he stated his case eloquently with a superb individual display that made him an instant hero on The Kop.

Liverpool's 4-2 win, secured with late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah, was packed with sub-plots - not all of them good. Indeed, the scoreline barely touches the sides of a chaotic night.

It all started with emotional tributes to Diogo Jota, the Liverpool striker killed in a car crash in July, along with his brother Andre Silva.

The Kop was adorned with banners paying tribute to Jota, including one for his family reading: 'Anfield will always be your home. You'll Never Walk Alone' before a minute's silence.

Jota was remembered in song throughout, with a rousing minute of applause after 20 minutes for the beloved striker who wore the number 20 shirt.

It was a night when Liverpool's expensive transition was on display, with four Premier League newcomers including Ekitike and Florian Wirtz, as well as full-back pair Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.

The scale of change is illustrated by the fact that, excluding the inaugural 1992-93 season, Liverpool are the first reigning champions to name as many as four Premier League debutants in their opening-day starting line-up.

Ekitike was the best of that quartet by a distance, throwing up a conundrum about how head coach Arne Slot will adapt should Liverpool return to Tyneside with a bid closer to the striker Newcastle rate at Â£150m.

Slot has barely used a strike pairing since he arrived at Liverpool, so it would be a change of gear to combine Ekitike and Isak should the latter arrive.

It may not quite beg the question of whether Liverpool actually need to make such a lavish outlay on another striker, but it will give Slot a conundrum to solve.

For now, Slot can revel in the talent of Ekitike, who added to his Community Shield goal against Crystal Palace with a vibrant performance here - not only breaking the deadlock with a composed first-half finish but also creating a second for Cody Gakpo.

Ekitike could have had a hat-trick, missing two presentable headed chances, but this was a performance rich in promise that suggests he is a Premier League-ready striker, irrespective of further Liverpool transfer activity.

The calm manner of his finish and smart link play was a far cry from the frenetic approach of the now departed 'Captain Chaos' Darwin Nunez. Indeed, he is only the second player to both score and assist a goal on his Premier League debut for Liverpool - after the Uruguayan against Fulham in August 2022.

Ekitike made a '20' gesture in honour of Jota after scoring, while Salah replicated the beloved Portuguese's trademark shark celebration after he wrapped up the win.

If Ekitike was the highlight, the defensive vulnerability that troubled Liverpool in pre-season and in the Community Shield was brutally exposed once more by Bournemouth's excellence.

The absence of the suspended Ryan Gravenberch left gaping holes in Liverpool's midfield, while the attacking approach of new full-back pairing Frimpong and Kerkez left space on the flanks to be exploited.

Liverpool's weakness was punished by Bournemouth's second goal, a fine equaliser from Antoine Semenyo that left Anfield living on its nerves - a goal of individual ambition but one of concern for the reigning Premier League champions.

Salah lost the ball on the edge of Bournemouth's penalty area, Semenyo subsequently racing unchallenged for 50 yards - Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate merely onlookers before he coolly found the bottom corner.

Slot brought a calm, methodical approach to Liverpool's game last season following the magnificent chaos of Jurgen Klopp's reign, but this was a throwback summed up by that granstand finish.

It was also an indication that a balance must be achieved between the players who won the title last season and the integration of Â£300m worth of new acquisitions.

Sadly, a night of superb football entertainment was marred by alleged racist abuse towards Semenyo in the first half by a member of the crowd. Referee Anthony Taylor halted the game as it was reported to him.

Semenyo's response was a brilliant performance that almost earned the Cherries a point, but once again racism reared its ugly head and was widely condemned.

Liverpool earned the win, but this was an almighty scare which acted as confirmation that Slot may face some early bumps in the road after last season's stroll to the title.

For Ekitike, however, this was the perfect start.

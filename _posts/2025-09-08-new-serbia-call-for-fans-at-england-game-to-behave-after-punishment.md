It has been recently reported that Over 8,000 seats at the Rajko Mitic Stadium will be left empty as part of Serbia's punishment

Serbia have called on "supporters to send out an image to the world that will make us all proud" as they prepare to host England in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier.

At least 15% of Belgrade's Rajko Mitic Stadium will be closed to home fans as a Fifa punishment for racist chanting in a game against Andorra.

A statement from the Serbian FA, external (FSS) said it has been fined more than Â£600,000 by Fifa and Uefa in the past five years.

The punishments were for "various prohibited items, insults, and discrimination in the stands", it said.

Branko Radujko, the general secretary of the FSS, warned Serbia fans in the match programme before the England game that any transgressions could get them in more trouble.

"We are still under special monitoring of Uefa," he wrote. "Every inappropriate reaction, insult or incident could cost us dearly on our path to the USA, Mexico and Canada, including the possibility of having to play a decisive match with Albania behind closed doors.

"That is the reason I sincerely and seriously call on you: let us cheer from the heart but let it be fair. We can be loud but dignified. Let our support be a source of strength, not a risk for the national team."

England captain Harry Kane said: "We had a meeting and discussed the Uefa protocols that are in place. We don't like to discuss it too much. Our focus is on the game. Anything can happen but we are not thinking about that.

"We are prepared to do what Uefa protocols allow us to do. I thought we handled it well in Bulgaria [in 2019]. We are prepared, had a discussion and if it [racist abuse] does happen we will be prepared to do what is necessary."

Uefa's three-point protocol asks referees to...

First of all, stop the game briefly and make an announcement on the public address system for fans to stop the racism

Then if it continues, stop the game for five to 10 minutes and take the players off the pitch while making another announcement

And if it continues after the second restart, the referee can abandon the game

BBC Sport looks at the reasons for Serbia's punishments - and the history of racism England have faced against Serbian national teams before.

Most of Serbia's recent punishments have been to do with Kosovo.

After the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo sought independence.

Serbia responded with a brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanians that ended in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign against Serbia.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 - but Serbia does not recognise this.

Serbia fans, usually led by ultras groups, sing "Kosovo is the heart of Serbia", or one stand yells "Kosovo" and the other "Serbia".

There are also derogatory chants against Albanians, Croats and Bosnian Muslims.

Serbia have had numerous punishments from both Fifa and Uefa in recent years. Here is a selection of those from the past three years

2025: Partial stadium closure for this England game following discriminatory abuse against Andorra

2024: Partial stadium closures for two home matches and banned from selling tickets for away games following discriminatory abuse - including reportedly trying to burn an Albania flag - and damage caused in two Nations League games

2024: The Serbian FA fined Â£12,250 after objects were thrown and a provocative message was displayed during their Euro 2024 defeat by England

2023: Partial stadium closure for fans' discriminatory abuse during a win over Montenegro

2022: The country's FA fined around Â£18,000 after a flag showing Kosovo as part of Serbia with the phrase "we do not surrender" was hung in the dressing room for a game against Brazil at the World Cup

None of the recent charges are thought to relate to racism about black players.

England Under-21 players have suffered racist abuse by Serbia fans on two high-profile occasions.

In 2007, the FSS was fined Â£16,000 at the European Championship in the Netherlands after their supporters racially abused England's Nedum Onuoha.

And in 2012, England defender Danny Rose was sent off for kicking the ball away in reaction to racist chants from the crowd in Krusevac during a Euros qualifier.

Rose said he was subjected to monkey chants throughout and had stones thrown at him.

Andros Townsend also played in that game and spoke about the issue on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club.

"Back in 2013 there wasn't any of that," he said in relation to Uefa's three-point protocols for racism.

"We were in shock. We were not expecting it. There were no protocols in place. It ended up in a 22-man melee with the coaching staff and fans climbing over the fence. It was an ugly scene. The game has moved on a lot since then.

"If it does happen [on Tuesday] the players have agreed to do X, Y and Z and let the authorities deal with it after."

The Serbian FA's statement added: "The national team is our pride, we have no other, and it certainly deserves the support fitting for these important matches. 

"We would like to emphasize the importance and necessity of proper behaviour that contributes to creating a positive stadium atmosphere. 

"Therefore, let us be united in our love for football, support our national team in the right way, and show respect for the opponent and the national anthem of their country. 

"Let the match with England be a celebration of sport and respect among rivals and nations."

Radujko added: "Football was born in England, but Belgrade must be the place where the game gets a new emotion on 9 September. 

"This is our chance to be united to remind ourselves why we love football and how much it means when the whole nation breathes as one. This is the match for points, but also for pride."

England boss Thomas Tuchel said: "I always believe in the good and believe we will have a high level sporting occasion. I don't want to put a focus on it because I believe in the beauty of the sport and the beauty of the game."

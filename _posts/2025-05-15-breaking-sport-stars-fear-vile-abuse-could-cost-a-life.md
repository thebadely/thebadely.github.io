Let's dive into the details: Ofcom says an online presence is vital for some people working in the sport sector

Content warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and mental health.

Sportspeople and pundits have told a regulator that "vile" online abuse has become so severe they fear it could lead to someone taking their own life.

Former cricketer Azeem Rafiq, broadcaster and ex-England footballer Eni Aluko and ex-rugby referee Wayne Barnes were among those interviewed by the government's online safety regulator, Ofcom.

Working with the football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, Ofcom spoke to  figures from across sport and broadcasting to get an understanding of their experiences to help with tackling the issue.

It heard that one person barricaded themselves indoors following abuse, and others reported suffering from disordered eating. Fear, anxiety and paranoia had all resulted from suffering abuse, Ofcom said.

"Participants raised concerns that it might only be a matter of time before online hate and abuse becomes a major factor contributing to the suicide of someone in the sector," Ofcom said in its report documenting the project.

The body spoke to seven selected individuals and held nine discussion groups to examine the impacts of the abuse.

Those interviewed said online platforms needed to offer more protection and felt current tools - such as the ability to block or mute accounts - were not enough.

Ofcom's report - Online Hate and Abuse in Sport - was released on Friday.

Divisive Online Safety rules become law in UK

Some of the abuse encountered by people in sport is illegal under UK law. The Online Safety Act dictates that social media platforms have a duty to protect users.

Ofcom says it is working on a code of practice to help the companies meet their obligations.

It added projects such as this research would help to shape its work with the platforms.

Some of the abuse detailed is not considered illegal, but Ofcom says it will be "pushing" the companies to make their platforms safer.

"So many people who work in sport are subjected to vile abuse online. This is having a devastating impact on them, their livelihoods and their families, and no-one should have to put up with it," said Jessica Zucker, online safety director at Ofcom.

"The UK's new online safety laws mean tech firms now have to start protecting people on their sites and apps from illegal forms of abuse.

"And when all the rules are fully in force, some of the largest social media platforms will have to give users more control over what they see online.

"We'll be pushing companies hard to make their services safer by design, and holding them to account if they don't."

The Online Safety Act became law in October 2023, though some elements - for example, a series of child safety rules - have not yet come into force.

Eni Aluko and Azeem Rafiq have both suffered extensive online abuse

Those interviewed told researchers about the scale of abuse they suffered and its impacts.

Participants were chosen because they had experience of abuse. Former Yorkshire cricketer Rafiq encountered abuse and threats after documenting the racism he suffered in the game.

"The abuse left me feeling incredibly paranoid, at times, and often made me question my sanity," Rafiq says in the report.

"The impact of this experience on me as a human being and on my mental health has damaged my life to such an extent, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to quantify it."

Aluko, who last month won the first stage of a libel case after being targeted on social media by ex-footballer Joey Barton, is not quoted in the report but did contribute to it.

Ex-international rugby referee Barnes detailed the abuse aimed at his wife, which he says "shocked" him. Much of it originated after contentious decisions taken in games, he said.

"I wasn't active on social media. She then became the subject of the abuse, with people attacking her personally via direct messages to her social media accounts and work email address, or by posting fake and offensive friend requests. The abuse went on for some time," Barnes said.

He said "misogynistic language" and even "threats of sexual violence" were aimed at her.

The report documents how "a female TV sports presenter will get horrendous amounts of abuse, often just about what she's wearing".

Another contributor said: "I didn't leave my house for a week because of the impact of online abuse, the sort of wave [of intensity] and the amount of people that are abusing you."

Researchers were told that the fear of receiving more abuse led to some of the contributors turning down work.

Sanjay Bhandari, chair of the anti-discrimination body Kick It Out, said: "The impact of online abuse is undeniable, and the rise in discriminatory social media reports to Kick It Out last season shows it's getting worse."

He said the Ofcom report showed "a culture of abuse that has become normalised".

"It's vital that we see social media companies step up with meaningful tools that give users real control over what they see and experience online," he added.

Let's dive into the details: Emma Raducanu (left) won the US Open women's singles in 2021 and Carlos Alcaraz (right) won the men's singles in 2022

The US Open has confirmed 14 of the pairings that will compete for $1m (Â£749,077) in next month's controversial mixed doubles event.

Organisers were heavily criticised in February after announcing that the mixed doubles competition would be a standalone event on 19-20 August - before the hard court Grand Slam begins on 24 August.

British number one Emma Raducanu and five-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz are one of six wildcard pairings, with eight teams gaining direct entry.

The US Open said a further two wildcard entries will be announced at a later date.

Of the 14 teams named so far, there are eight men and six women ranked in the top 10 in singles, and nine Grand Slam singles champions.

Venus Williams takes up one of the wildcard places alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka.

Wimbledon singles champions Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner have direct entry with their respective partners Casper Ruud and Emma Navarro.

British number one Jack Draper also goes into the draw via that route, partnering Spain's Paula Badosa.

Last year's mixed doubles winners Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - who described the scheduling change as a "profound injustice" in a joint statement in February, and dubbed the new format "a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show" - have received a wildcard entry.

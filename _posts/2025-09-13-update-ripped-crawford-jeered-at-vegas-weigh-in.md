Canelo v Crawford face-off in Las Vegas

A shredded Terence Crawford was booed relentlessly by Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez's fans as a Mexican crowd made the home fighter feel as if he had walked straight into the lion's den at Friday's weigh-in in Las Vegas.

Crawford - jumping up two divisions - weighed the same as the defending champion.

Mexican Alvarez, 35, will defend his WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and WBO titles at the Allegiant Stadium.

Unbeaten Crawford is aiming to become the first male three-division undisputed champion in the modern era. He came in just half a pound under the 12st (75kg) limit.

Canelo v Crawford - all you need to know

The 37-year-old Nebraska native looked in incredible shape, with defined abs showing despite the extra weight.

The official weigh-in was held behind closed doors at the Fontainebleau on Friday morning. 

But several thousands of fans packed in the T-Mobile Arena later for the ceremonial weigh-in, which felt like a full-blown victory parade with a carnival of Mexican flags, football kits and chanting.

Crawford looked composed and undeterred, smiling amid the jeers. 

"I feel wonderful. I can't wait until tomorrow," he said before blowing kisses to the crowd.

Crawford: 'A win will make me one of the greatest fighters of all time'

Neither Crawford or Alvarez have been knocked down before in their careers

Alvarez fans congregated outside the arena hours before the fighters even appeared.

Every time Crawford's name was read, or his face flashed on the big screen, it was drowned beneath a tidal wave of boos.

When the fighters stood next to each other there appeared little difference in size or height.

Crawford first became world champion at lightweight before unifying the light-welterweight and welterweight divisions.

Thirteen months ago, he moved up to light-middleweight and beat Israil Madrimov in arguably his closest contest yet.

Alvarez, who turned professional at just 15 in 2005, has a record of 63 wins, two defeats and two draws. Saturday marks his 21st fight in Las Vegas.

His experience at super-middleweight could prove decisive. Neither fighter has been dropped as a professional, but Alvarez's natural power at 12st may push Crawford into uncharted territory.

"I trained for everything. I get back to basics. I need to put everything in this fight," Canelo said.

British legend Lennox Lewis warned Crawford about the dangers of stepping up in weight.

"It's not really easy coming up in weight. You get hit hard and sometimes it can affect you," Lewis told BBC Sport.

"What Crawford has to realise is not to get hit to save his energy. He's coming up against a guy who can hit hard. 

"To absorb those punches takes the energy out of you."

Crawford is the underdog but is unbeaten in 41 pro fights

Jumping up in weight has, historically, left challengers vulnerable against naturally bigger champions. 

Yet in Las Vegas this week, many pundits and fighters are tipping Crawford to win - a testament to his adaptability and ring IQ.

Crawford looks toned and muscular - not having put on weight at the expense of his athleticism - but whether he can carry the same speed, timing and precision into the ring remains the question.

He says the extra pounds have been a blessing rather than a burden.

"It's been different because I don't have to worry about anything - the weight room, strength and conditioning, when I'm eating and things like that. I'm as happy as could be," he told BBC Sport on Tuesday.

The freedom has even extended to breakfast.

"I woke up and ate pancakes this morning. I would never have been able to eat pancakes before," he said.

If Crawford can dethrone Alvarez in Nevada, it won't just be another indulgence. It will be the syrup on top of a career already dripping with greatness.

'He's done it again!' - Root's sublime 160 builds England run total

Joe Root said he would "love" to be part of England's next Ashes tour in 2029-30, during which he will turn 39 years old.

England's all-time leading run-scorer made his 41st century on the second day of the fifth Test against Australia in Sydney, the finale of his fourth tour down under.

Despite a stellar career, Root has never won an Ashes series in Australia. England's win in the fourth Test of this series was Root's first in 18 attempts.

If the former England captain does extend his career for another four years, he is likely to break the record for most Test caps and runs.

"One thing I always try and look at is opportunity," said Root. "I don't know how many opportunities I'm going to get to come back to Australia."

Asked if he would like to be part of the next Ashes tour, Root replied: "Who knows? We'll see. I'd love to. We'll see how things unfold in time."

Root's 160 helped England to 384 all out at the Sydney Cricket Ground, before Australia responded with 166-2. He spent almost two hours off the field during Australia's innings, an absence that was later attributed to cramp in his back.

This latest century took Root to 13,937 Test runs, just under 2,000 behind India great Sachin Tendulkar, the only man with more. Root is playing his 163rd Test and four more years as an England international would present enough opportunities to go past Tendulkar's caps record of 200.

Root is a two-time Ashes winner in home series, but his career has coincided with England's woeful record down under.

On Root's previous three tours, England have lost 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0. He was captain for the two 4-0 defeats.

England surrendered this series with defeats in the first three Tests, yet managed to avoid the 5-0 clean sweep with victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was a first victory in Australia for both Root and his successor as England captain Ben Stokes.

"It was great to win at the MCG," said Root. "Hopefully that benefits the Test team moving forward when it comes back to playing here, having good memories.

"For a lot of this squad it is the first time they've been out here, so if they've got good memories and we can find a way to win this fixture, next time we come out, the last two memories we'd have out here would be two Ashes wins.

"The baggage that might have been there for a previous generation might not be there for them. There's so much to play for throughout the next three days."

Root has previously suffered low moments in Sydney. In 2013-14, on his first Ashes tour, the Yorkshireman was left out in Sydney - the only time he has been dropped in his Test career.

Four years later, he ended up in hospital after batting in temperatures of 47C (116.6F). Illness prevented him from fulfilling his post-series presentation and media duties as captain.

Earlier in this tour, Root finally made his first Ashes hundred in Australia in the second Test in Brisbane.

He replicated his celebration from the Gabba when he reached three figures at the Sydney Cricket Ground, shrugging his shoulders in the direction of the Barmy Army.

"We've had some amazing support in this series and we've not been able to achieve what we set out to achieve," said Root.

"At no point has that ever wavered, and at no point has that ever wavered when I've come out here on tour. It's been exceptional. It's my way of saying thank you."

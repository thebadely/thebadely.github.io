It has been recently reported that Glenn Irwin has finished second and third in the BSB series in the past two seasons

Glenn Irwin is to have surgery on his pelvic region on Thursday as part of his treatment for the injuries he sustained in a crash at the British Superbike Championship round at Snetterton last weekend.

The Northern Ireland rider came off his Ducati machine at Turn Nine during a Free Practice session at the Norfolk circuit on Saturday and was transported to hospital after initially being assessed at the track's medical centre.

The 35-year-old was confirmed as having suffered fractures to his hip socket and pelvis.

In a statement released on social media on Tuesday, Irwin's Hager PBM Ducati team explained that the decision to undergo surgery had been made "after lengthy discussions with his medical team".

"Glenn is scheduled to undergo surgery on his sacrum (pelvic region) this Thursday morning," read the statement.

"We understand the serious nature of this injury and our heartfelt thoughts and best wishes are with Glenn during this difficult time.

"Following the procedure, we'll be focusing on his recovery with an intensive rehabilitation plan. Until that gets underway, it's not possible to predict a timeline for his recovery and his return to the Hager PBM Ducati team and the British Superbike Championship."

Before being sidelined after his crash, Irwin had been sitting second in the BSB standings, having been on the podium in four of the first five races of the 2025 season.

From Carrickfergus in county Antrim, Irwin won a record 11 Superbike races  in a row at the North West 200 before calling it quits on that discipline of the sport last year.

He became the fastest ever newcomer at the Isle of Man TT in his only appearance at that event in 2022 and the nearest he has come to winning the British Superbike title to date was in 2023, when he lost out to then team-mate Tommy Bridewell by just half a point.

"We know Glenn will be greatly missed from the BSB grid, and we're truly grateful for the overwhelming support and kind messages we've received," continued the update from the PBM outfit.

"The team is working hard on finding a suitable stand-in rider with the aim of being back on track at Knockhill [round four of the BSB series from 4-6 July]."

It has been recently reported that A young woman has founded a support group for women with reproductive health problems, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Bethany Lewis, 18, is a trainee dental nurse from Weston Rhyn in Shropshire and was diagnosed with PCOS in April 2025.

A few months later she set up The Cysters Circle, which meets up periodically across the county in different towns to reach a wider audience.

PCOS causes painful and irregular periods, and the NHS estimates it affects up to one in 10 women in the UK. "[The circle was] really needed, not just for myself but for other people as well," Ms Lewis said. 

PCOS is a hormonal disorder that leads to ovaries producing large amounts of male sex hormones that interfere with the development and release of a woman's eggs and can also affect periods and fertility.

Ms Lewis said her symptoms include "very heavy periods" and "dull pain that doesn't go away," meaning she often has to take "very strong painkillers."

The circle supports women and girls with endometriosis, PCOS, or "any other hormonal and reproductive health conditions," she said.

When she was first diagnosed in April, Ms Lewis said she "didn't know anything about the condition," educating herself using the internet.

"It's been challenging mentally as well as physically," she added.

"It's very lonely as well, so it's good to have the support in the group."

The group's first meeting last month had just two other attendees - but a few weeks later, at their next meet-up in Telford, eleven women took part.

"It's a massive jump in comparison to our first one, and it's nice to just start building that community," Ms Lewis said.

Those attending share experiences, recommendations, and vent frustrations.

"We have quite a lot of resources from charities as well that we're able to hand out," Ms Lewis continued. 

"It's nice to sit there with people who actually understand what you're going through."

Her goal is to "support more women and girls," adding that raising awareness is needed "not just locally in Shropshire, but around the UK".

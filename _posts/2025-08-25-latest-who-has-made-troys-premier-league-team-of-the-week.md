Let's dive into the details: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Jordan Pickford (Everton): I thought he had a good game. It was a massive occasion for Everton at their new stadium. The penalty save was one everyone will say was easy, but at that point Brighton were on the up and if they scored I think they would have gone on and won. It was one of those matches where you need a big-game player and he stepped up and it was a great save.

Michael Kayode (Brentford): He was a monster against Aston Villa - long throws, tackling, interceptions and aggressive to shut down Morgan Rogers on more than one occasion. Exceptional performance from him and helped Brentford secure their first win of the season.

Micky van de Ven (Tottenham): I thought Van de Ven was excellent. A clean sheet against Man City, a team that everyone thought would be flying and back to the way they were. He set the tempo. There were three or four occasions where he set the press, he was really tight to his player, even times when he went from Erling Haaland all the way to the goalkeeper. He's been a colossus under Thomas Frank.

Hjalmar Ekdal (Burnley): Huge game for Burnley. First game at home, you want to win against Sunderland who got three points last week - and at the heart of it he was heading everything away and putting in big blocks as well.

Jurrien Timber (Arsenal): Two goals for the right-back who was excellent on his first start of the season. Was probably a little bit unlucky not to start last week, but showed when Arsenal have a more attacking style he's going to play more games.

Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): Excellent even though he was on the losing team, he was the heartbeat, made tackles and scored the goal to get his side back in the game. He was like a conductor, making sure everybody was playing to his tune and kept going - and he made Liverpool really sweat and worry. After losing Sandro Tonali and Joelinton, he made sure they kicked on again. I thought he was fantastic.

Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Scored against West Ham and he could get 10-12 goals this season because he just keeps creeping into threatening areas from midfield. An excellent captain's performance. When Cole Palmer went down, he was the one to take the lead.

Jack Grealish (Everton): Jack was fantastic. It was great to see him smiling and playing with freedom, with Everton looking to find him on all occasions - and he delivered with two assists. Jack playing well is not only good for him but also for England.

Brennan Johnson (Tottenham): He was fantastic against Man City and has two goals in two games now. He looks like he's going to have an unbelievable season because Mohammed Kudus is going to take a lot of defenders' focus coming from the right-hand side on his left foot. The pace and power he shows is unbelievable. 

Joao Pedro (Chelsea): Goals and assists for the striker again against a poor West Ham team. He looks really composed, he looks like he's meant to be at Chelsea. Could've had a few more if players had passed to him, but a solid performance.

Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): The man of the moment: Viktor Gyokeres. This was a massive game for him in terms of expectations - with some people wanting him to score and others wanting him to fail. Granted, it was against Leeds, but he's off the mark and took his goals well. Was he exceptional? No, but I think with the level of pressure, and after Kai Havertz went down, he stepped up and delivered - so you have to give him credit for that.

Thomas Frank (Tottenham): In his first three games in charge, he's showed tactical awareness and tweaked things. He's made a team Ange Postecoglou was complaining about - they were injured, they can't do this, they can't do that - into a really solid outfit. Spurs have played three different formations in the PSG match and their two games in the Premier League, and know what they're doing. They're adaptable against different teams. Keith Andrews is my close second with his first win for Brentford.

Jurrien Timber

After an injury-hit start to his Premier League career, Jurrien Timber has blossomed into one of Mikel Arteta's most consistent and reliable players.

At the weekend, the Dutch defender marked his first start of the new campaign with a superb forward-thinking display, netting two goals and providing an additional assist.

Timber became just the second Arsenal defender in Premier League history to manage three goal involvements in a game, after Spaniard Nacho Monreal. It was also Timber's first-ever double in top-flight football, with both goals coming courtesy of the Gunners' trademark potent corners.

With a joint game-high four tackles made and another game-high three shots in total, Timber is well worth his place on this week's podium.

Joao Pedro

Joao Pedro was Brighton's standout performer in 2024-25, registering 16 goal involvements in the Premier League, more than any other Seagull.

The Brazilian has continued that fruitful form into 2025-26, kick-starting his Chelsea career with three goals in three games at the Club World Cup and getting among the goals in the Premier League at the weekend.

Against an admittedly lacklustre West Ham side, Joao Pedro netted the opening goal before going on to provide two more assists, only the second time the attacker had managed three goal involvements in a Premier League game, after doing so for Brighton against Tottenham in December 2023.

Against the Hammers, the Â£60m man also mustered a joint game-high three shots while he won more duels (9) and twice as many aerial duels (6) as any other player in the game.

Jordan Pickford

Everton christened the Hill Dickinson Stadium in perfect style, courtesy of a 2-0 win over Brighton. However, it could have been a very different outcome had it not been for a superb display from Jordan Pickford.

The England number one was kept busy all afternoon against a somewhat unlucky Brighton side, making four saves, the joint-most of any top-flight keeper at the weekend.

One of those stops came from a late Danny Welbeck penalty, bringing Pickford's tally of Premier League spot-kick saves to eight, a figure bettered by only three other English keepers - David James (13), Rob Green (9) and Ben Foster (9).

Additionally, since the start of last season, only David Raya (15) has managed more shut-outs than the in-form Pickford (13).

Here’s what you need to know: Arsenal defender Leah Williamson has not played since winning Euro 2025 with England

Arsenal defender Leah Williamson is to return to action for the first time since the Euro 2025 final following a four-month absence through injury.

The England captain is expected to play for "a couple of minutes" in Arsenal's Women's Champions League game against FC Twente on Tuesday evening, manager Renee Slegers said. 

Williamson was an unused substitute in Arsenal's 2-1 victory over Liverpool on Saturday.

The 28-year-old has been absent since Euro 2025 â when she led the Lionesses to back-to-back titles â due to a knee injury which required a small, clean-up operation.

"She's been training with the team and was in the squad against Liverpool just to get back into her routine and it was good to have her around," said Slegers.

"She is doing well and did the full session again today. She is available for a couple of minutes tomorrow (Tuesday, 20:00 GMT). She won't start but she will be in the squad."

During her absence Arsenal have struggled to find the form which guided them to the Women's Champions League title under Slegers last season.

They currently sit eight points off Women's Super League leaders Manchester City and are 10th in the league phase table of the European competition with two wins from four matches.

"Of course it was unfortunate for her to sustain that injury in the Euros and she had to work hard to come back from it," added Slegers.

"She is in a really good place and has been spending a lot of time on the pitch. Maybe the timing of the international break extended that as there was no opportunity to train in big groups with 11 v 11 and in chaotic moments.

"But she is very ready and we will be very happy to have her back. The players who have been playing have been doing really well."

Arsenal captain Kim Little has also recovered from a calf injury, coming off the bench in the 69th minute against Liverpool.

Slegers did not rule out a start for Little against FC Twente but said the club have to be "really smart" in managing her return to full fitness.

The return of experienced players could provide a boost to Slegers' side, who have work to do to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Asked if confidence was low in the squad, Slegers said: "I think that's a word we don't really talk about. We believe with your actions, you can create momentum.

"Of course, when you look at the second half of last season how easy things were for us and that we were in a flow state, scoring a lot of goals, then if that's different or harder, then of course you have to work even harder from a psychological aspect to make sure everyone feels good and believes in what we're doing. I think that's been excellent from the squad."

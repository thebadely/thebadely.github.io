Let's dive into the details: Wood has taken 119 wickets in 37 Tests 

England fast bowler Mark Wood says he hopes to play for Durham next month as he  attempts to return from injury in time for this winter's Ashes series in Australia.

Wood, 35, a crucial part of England's hopes to win in Australia, has not played since February after surgery on a knee injury suffered at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. 

He had hoped to return for the fifth Test against India earlier this month before a setback. He was also left out of the squad for next month's white-ball matches against South Africa and Ireland as England prioritised the winter ahead.

"The injury is all right," Wood told the Stick to Cricket podcast.

"It was 50-50 whether I was going to make the India Test but I was bowling at Lord's and then, the next day, my knee swelled up again so I had it drained and since then it's just been about taking things easy looking ahead to the winter."

Wood's importance to England bid to win the Ashes for the first time since 2015 cannot be overstated. 

They want a group of bowlers capable of generating high pace in Australia and Wood, who has had a number of injury issues throughout his career, is the quickest of their options, which also include Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson.

Should Chris Woakes fail to recover from his shoulder injury or be omitted, Wood may also be the only frontline bowler in England's squad who has played a Test in Australia. He took 17 wickets across four Tests on the 2021-22 tour, including nine in the fifth Test in Hobart.

Durham have three County Championship matches left this season - against Essex from 8 September, at home to Worcestershire on 15 September and away to Yorkshire on 24 September.

"I'll try and play one or two of those," Wood said.

"I've been well looked after and very cautious.

"I value it as they've got this end game where they want me to get to Australia.

"But I said to [England coach Brendon McCullum] Baz McCullum I can't just bowl to a net for four months, I'll go insane. 

"There's a bowling camp in Loughborough in a tent - getting acclimatised there ready for Perth - then I'll go over to Perth early with a couple of bowlers. 

"We'll arrive about a week early to prepare and get acclimatised."

The Ashes begins in Perth on 21 November.

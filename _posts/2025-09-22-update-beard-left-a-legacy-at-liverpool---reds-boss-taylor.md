According to new developments, Matt Beard managed Liverpool Women for more than 160 matches during his two spells at the club

Matt Beard left a "legacy" at Liverpool and his death will leave "a big void", says current Reds women's team manager Gareth Taylor.

Beard, who guided Liverpool to Women's Super League (WSL) titles in 2013 and 2014, died on Saturday aged 47.

Taylor and his squad came together at their Melwood training centre on Monday and held a minute's silence, with further tributes planned for Tuesday at Anfield before Liverpool's men's side play Southampton in the Carabao Cup third round.

"We have lost Matt far too young," said Taylor. "But where we can take some solace is by thinking of the huge impact he managed to have on so many people across his 47 years - a real legacy and he packed in more than a lot of people who are fortunate to be around until their old age.

"It's just really devastating news," said Taylor. "Devastating for his family and friends and especially [wife] Debbie, [and children] Harry and Ellie. All of our thoughts of course are with them at this moment.

"It's a huge loss and he will leave a big void."

Beard's death leaves 'football family devastated'

Beard had two spells in charge at Liverpool and after his reappointment in 2021 helped them win promotion back to the WSL, and a seventh-placed finish on their return to the top flight. 

Taylor became Reds boss in August and added: "I had a bit more insight into Matt because I used to play with his brother Mark at Sheffield United. They were very close and really supportive of each other's journeys. 

"I had big shoes to fill when I came in here, and I was really supported well by Matt. He phoned me on a number of occasions. What a guy - you never fell out with him.

"I have to say, he's the most enjoyable to work with - in the sense of coming up against - in my time in the women's game. The legacy he has left, as a person firstly, because of the impression he left on the people he worked with at all of his clubs, particularly here at Liverpool. And then obviously his record as a gaffer. 

"He took Liverpool to the real heights of the game. The most decorated women's manager for Liverpool and I think that is only half of the story. The other half is the void he will leave as a person. 

"He served all of his clubs really, really well and definitely left an impression. As a person, as a coach, as an employee of a club, that's what you look for - to try to leave an impression, and you hope it's a good one. It certainly was with Matt. He left so many memories for people to hold on to."

Men's team manager Arne Slot said Beard "did great things for this football club".

"I think the Melwood staff and everyone that worked with him liked him so much - and that's probably even a more important legacy to leave behind than the trophies you win," he added.

"The person you are is always more important than what you've won. But in his situation, both things were combined: so successful as a manager and a great human being.

"It's not only that he gets all the respect he deserves here at Liverpool but I think all around women's football."

Liverpool Women managing director Andy O'Boyle also paid tribute to Beard, saying: "On behalf of everyone at Liverpool Football Club, I'd just like to extend our greatest condolences to Matt's family; his wife Debbie, his children Harry and Ellie, and his wider family and friends.

"It has been a really sad time for everyone. You have seen how the club and football have come together, and we extend our sympathies to Matt's family and friends at this time.

"Matt has been an iconic figure in the women's game. Obviously winning two WSL titles with Liverpool and then also getting promoted from the Championship up to the WSL. You can see over the years the success he has brought to the club.

"Not just the success on the pitch, the success off the pitch as well in terms of the people, the players, the staff, colleagues within the game - you can see how much love and joy he brought to Liverpool, the football club and also to women's football and wider football."

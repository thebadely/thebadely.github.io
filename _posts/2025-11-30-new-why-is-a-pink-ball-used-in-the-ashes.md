Experts revealed that The Ashes use a pink ball for day-night Test matches to improve visibility under floodlights.

The colour is suitable for play during the day and night.

Day-night Tests, which is the only time a pink ball is used, were sanctioned by the International Cricket Council, cricket's governing body, in 2015 in the hope audiences would be "encouraged and improved".

The red ball has traditionally been used since the Ashes series began in 1882 and is still used in all daytime-only matches.

The pink ball was first introduced in the 2017-18 series as the red ball is not as visible in floodlit conditions.

In the 2025-26 series, the pink ball will be used in the second Test in Brisbane, Australia from 4-8 December.

Pink balls are designed to provide balanced visibility in formats which transition from daylight to floodlights during play. 

They were first trialled in the late 2000s and have become a staple of international cricket.

The pink ball has been used in three Ashes Tests in Australia. 

There was one match in the 2017-18 series and two in the 2021-22 series, with Australia winning all three matches.

There has never been a pink-ball Ashes Test in England, with the only day-night Test in the country against West Indies in 2017. England won by an innings and 209 runs. 

There has been 24 day-night Tests and 13 have been played in Australia. They have won 12 of those 13 matches.

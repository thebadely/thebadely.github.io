Experts revealed that The Scottish Premiership returns with a bang following a positive international break for the national team.

A huge game at Ibrox headlines the weekend schedule, while a number of deadline-day signings are set to get their first taste of action at their new clubs.

One player stands out for us at Pittodrie, and we are shining our manager spotlight in the visiting dugout at Rugby Park on Sunday.

Hearts investor Tony Bloom raised eyebrows last month when he claimed the Tynecastle club are in a position to split the Old Firm this season.

A rare victory at winless Rangers on Saturday would certainly make a statement.

Derek McInnes' side, who will be without record signing Eduardo Ageu and defender Frankie Kent, travel to Govan with 10 points from four games, while Russell Martin's men have opened with four straight draws.

Rangers looked more organised in a dreary Old Firm stalemate last time out, but their attacking output will have to improve.

Thelo Aasgaard will bounce back from Norway duty after a remarkable four-goal display off the bench in an 11-1 win over Moldova.

And Martin can look to deadline-day signing Youssef Chermiti, signed from Everton for a deal reported to be worth Â£10m, to give his team more cutting edge after they failed to register a shot on target against Celtic.

Stretching back to last season, the Ibrox side have failed to win their past five league matches, their longest winless run in the top flight in 20 years.

But they are unbeaten in 18 meetings with Hearts, who have gone 17 visits to Rangers without success since winning 2-1 in the Championship in August 2014.

Something's gotta give.

Brendan Rodgers' pre-match press conference is perhaps more anticipated than Celtic's match on Sunday.

The Northern Irishman has not faced questions from the media since a hugely underwhelming deadline day was followed by more fan fury directed towards the club's board.

With a late entry protest planned at Rugby Park, it will be intriguing to hear the manager's reaction, but he will also be keen to focus on what looks set to be a tricky trip to Kilmarnock, who are unbeaten but winless after four games.

Across both spells as Celtic boss, Rodgers has suffered defeat at Rugby Park on four occasions, but the champions have won 16 of their past 19 meetings against the Ayrshire team.

Although supporters of the Parkhead side remain disenchanted at their club's transfer window, Rodgers will have new faces Sebastian Tounekti and Kelechi Iheanacho to call on to try to improve a blunt attack.

Aberdeen go into Saturday's home fixture with Livingston rooted to the foot of the table, losing three straight games without scoring.

However, spirits raised among the Dons support with a statement end to the transfer window.

Striker Kevin Nisbet was brought back on a permanent deal, with Scotland team-mate Stuart Armstrong also joining.

But perhaps the most eye-catching acquisition across the league on deadline day was the loan signing of Bologna winger Jesper Karlsson.

The 27-year-old, who has 14 caps for Sweden, excelled under manager Jimmy Thelin at Elfsborg before earning a move to AZ Alkmaar.

After scoring 46 goals and assisting 33 with the Dutch top-flight side, the forward sealed a reported Â£10m switch to Serie A two years ago.

Things have not quite worked out at Bologna for Karlsson, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Lecce. 

But, on paper, the Swede still has the potential to be an outstanding signing for a Dons side in desperate need of attacking inspiration.

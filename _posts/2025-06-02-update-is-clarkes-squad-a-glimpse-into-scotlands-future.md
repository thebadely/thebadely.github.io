Steve Clarke is no stranger to adapting and evolving as Scotland manager.

During his six years in charge of the national team, he has regularly changed his squad and has reached two major finals in the process.

A place at the World Cup is the next target for Clarke's Scotland, 27 years since their last appearance at the global showpiece in 1998.

The 61-year-old has selected seven uncapped players for this month's friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein as they gear up for their World Cup qualifying campaign, which gets under way in September. 

Hibernian striker Kieron Bowie and Sassuolo left-back Josh Doig are included, as are midfield trio Connor Barron of Rangers, West Ham United's Andy Irving and Lennon Miller of Motherwell.

Goalkeepers Robby McCrorie and Cieran Slicker are the other two players yet to make their full international debuts.

On the face of it, it appears Clarke is looking to the future, but what can we learn from his new-look squad?

One thing that stands out, in addition to the numerous uncapped players, is the volume of younger faces.

Of the 25-man squad, 12 are aged 25 or younger with their best years stretching ahead of them.

Lewis Ferguson is one of them. The Bologna captain continued his superb story on the continent by winning the Coppa Italia last season, but has struggled for regular starts in the dark blue of his country.

With Kenny McLean not included and Ryan Christie recovering from injury, he has an opportunity to stake his place in midfield alongside Billy Gilmour.

Max Johnston, 21, and the returning Nathan Patterson, 23, could be handed opportunities to impress with Anthony Ralston - the other right-back in the squad - second choice at Celtic.

Heart of Midlothian's James Wilson and Middlesbrough's Tommy Conway join Bowie as the other youthful striking options.

There is still a familiar feel to the spine of the squad, though. 

Wiser heads such as captain Andy Robertson, John McGinn, Kieran Tierney and Serie A MVP Scott McTominay remain, as Scotland seek momentum before the games that matter.

Angus Gunn was Scotland's goalkeeper at Euro 2024

Not long ago, Scotland had an abundance of quality goalkeeping talent at their disposal.

Any one of Craig Gordon, Allan McGregor or David Marshall were comfortable at international level.

These days, the resources between the sticks are less plentiful.

Gordon is now 42 and not included in this squad because of injury. It seems highly unlikely that even a man of his talent and resilience would feature at the 2026 World Cup if Scotland were to get there. 

Angus Gunn took the gloves at Euro 2024, but has made high-profile errors for both club and country and is now a free agent after being released by Norwich City.

That leaves the uncapped Slicker and McCrorie, both with limited experience at club level.

Clarke must either back Gunn or put his faith in one of his untested shot-stoppers.

Lennon Miller won the PFA Scotland young player of the year award last month

Of the uncapped players, Miller undoubtedly has the most hype around him.

Motherwell's 18-year-old midfielder has improved at a remarkable rate since making his senior club debut aged just 16.

He won the PFA Scotland young player of the year award last month after a season in which he scored four goals and assisted seven in 36 games.

Miller is expected to leave Fir Park for a sizeable transfer fee, one which could be bolstered should he make his Scotland bow against Iceland or Liechtenstein.

"I could maybe, in a couple of months, be the best player there," Miller said after his first Scotland call-up in March.

He later clarified his comments, saying the speed of that claim was a "mistake", but reiterating his desire to be the best player he possibly can be. 

Short of confidence, he is not.

Bowie is another who will fancy making an impact, should the opportunity arise.

Quick, strong and imposing, he scored six goals in his first season for Hibs after recovering from a hamstring injury sustained playing for Scotland Under-21s.

"Any time I watched the Under-21s he always stood out," Clarke said when naming his squad. "He's big, physical and strong - with good attributes to his game.

"Going into the summer, you've got Lawrence Shankland and Kevin Nisbet, I know what they can bring, so it was just to have a look at something a little bit different and see if we can expand the pool of players.

"You're looking for somebody to catch your eye."

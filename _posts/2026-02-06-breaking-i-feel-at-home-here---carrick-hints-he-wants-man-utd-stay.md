Let's dive into the details: Michael Carrick has won all three of his matches as interim boss of Man Utd so far

Michael Carrick has dropped the first hint he is keen on remaining as Manchester United head coach beyond the end of the season.

Carrick has tried to avoid any talk about his long-term future at Old Trafford since he was appointed as Ruben Amorim's temporary successor on 13 January.

Unlike Amorim, it is not Carrick's way to go looking for headlines or discuss with the media sensitive issues that his bosses would probably prefer were kept in-house.

That is why Carrick's answer seemed significant as he was asked about United's plans for the summer and how involved in them he would be.

"Nothing's changed, to be honest," he said.

"I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got. We want to be successful, and I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season - if that's me, if that's somebody else.

"At this stage, I can't control that and we'll see what happens, but it's certainly about trying to improve the team and making Manchester United stronger. Results over a short period of time don't change that.

"If they have changed there is something wrong. It can't be so knee-jerk whether it's really good or whether there's a few issues we need to solve."

Why Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision

Asked for his thoughts on what would happen if United's current run of three straight wins since he took over from interim boss Darren Fletcher last month continued, Carrick adopted a neutral stance.

"I'm loving what I'm doing. I'm here," he said. "I feel at home here, but I fully understand the situation, so I'm not getting too carried away."

United have pledged to take their time to assess all suitable candidates to replace Amorim, although a well-placed source with first-hand knowledge of appointing managers and coaches at club and international level has told BBC Sport signing a deal with a World Cup manager prior to the tournament was "a huge risk", for a number of reasons, including negative publicity from the country involved.

Meanwhile, Carrick confirmed Denmark international Patrick Dorgu could miss 10 weeks with the hamstring injury he suffered in the win at Arsenal last month.

Carrick has also revealed a Football Association (FA) connection between his brother Graeme and Steve Holland led to the former England and Chelsea assistant boss joining him at United.

Holland's arrival as part of a coaching team that also includes former England international Jonathan Woodgate, former United defender Jonny Evans and the club's under-21 coach Travis Binnion has been viewed as a masterstroke.

Graeme Carrick was involved in junior player development at St George's Park around the same time as Stockport-born Holland was joining Gareth Southgate working with England's under-21 side over a decade ago.

"When talks were progressing and it looked like I might be coming in, I had conversations with my brother and we ended up mentioning Steve," said Carrick.

"He knew him from the FA and I have come across Steve a number of times.

"I was fully aware of his experience and quality and we clicked straight away.

"He grew up being a massive United fan, which helped to start with but it was also being successful at Chelsea, knowing what it takes to win trophies with different styles, different managers and different types of players."

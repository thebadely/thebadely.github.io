Here’s what you need to know: Players from the Eagles and the Commanders clashed in the fourth quarter

Three players were ejected as the Philadelphia â Eagles beat the Washington Commanders 29-18 to win the NFC East title for the second year in a row.

Washington's Javon Kinlaw and Quan Martin were dismissed along with Philadelphia's Tyler Steen following a brawl between both sets of players in the fourth quarter.

The incident occurred after Saquon Barkley's two-point conversion put the visiting Eagles 29-10 in front, and the trio were flagged for unnecessary roughness during the clash.

"It's chippy out there. We have a lot of history with this team, especially since I've been here," said Barkley.

"This team don't like us, this is the truth, and we don't like them either. But we got to keep it football."

Barkley ran for 132 yards and a touchdown for the NFL champions, while team-mate Jalen Hurts completed 22 of 30 passes for 185 yards and two touchdowns. 

The victory meant the Eagles (10-5) became the first back-to-back winners of the NFC East since the 2004 season, when they ended a run of four division titles in a row.

"Back-to-back division champs, hasn't been done in 20 years, so that's big," said Barkley.

"I love the way we finished. We stood together and most importantly got the win."

The Eagles are now assured of a home game to start the play-offs, while the Commanders had already been eliminated from the post-season shake-up.

'Unbelievable!' - Bears score late touchdown

Elsewhere, the Chicago Bears moved to the brink of the play-offs with a dramatic 22-16 overtime win at home to the Green Bay Packers.

The Bears were 16-6 behind with just over five minutes left in the fourth, but levelled it in regulation time through a Cairo Santos field goal and Jahdae Walker touchdown with 24 seconds left.

Chicago quarterback Caleb Williams had found Walker for the score and then produced a 46-yard pass to DJ Moore in overtime for the winning touchdown.

The Bears are 11-4 for the season atop the NFC North, with Green Bay (9-5-1) in second place, with two games left in the regular season.

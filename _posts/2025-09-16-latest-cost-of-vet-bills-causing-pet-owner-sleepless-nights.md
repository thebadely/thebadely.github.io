Experts revealed that A pet owner says she has "sleepless nights" worrying about how she will cover the costs if her pets fall ill.

Alison from Northamptonshire has two dogs, seven rabbits and three guinea pigs, which collectively costs her up to £500 per month, not including vet bills.

She spends the majority of her salary on her pets and is "financially unable to insure all of them".

She said: "We don't have the holidays we used to have. Things like meals out and fun family things... we just can't do anymore.

"The monthly costs would easily double if we insured them all."

An insurance policy for one of her dogs, which had cancer and required treatment and surgery, eventually expired and had to be renewed. The new premium was £135 a month, which she found too expensive.

Alison said she is "constantly worrying" that she would be unable to afford any future treatments, which would result in putting the dog to sleep.

"The insurance cost out-prices the normal person," she added. 

The cost of pet insurance increased by 20% in March 2024 compared to the previous year, according to Dr Paul Manktelow, a spokesperson for Blue Cross. This rise aligns with the decrease in the number of pets being insured last year.

"We've seen a rise in vet fees across the board. It's come at a time where people have less money," he said. 

Dr Manktelow believes the cost of veterinary care is the "single biggest cost" of pet ownership.

"It doesn't look like it's going to go down any time soon either," he added

Rabbit vaccines are about £20 to £30 more expensive than the ones for dogs, states Alison. Four of Alison's rabbits require vaccines this month. She says that a vaccine costs £75 for each rabbit.

Rabbits are considered an 'exotic pet', which means vet bills can be higher than other animals.

As a result, Alison is forced to "think twice" about taking her rabbits to the vet and she treats them at home if she can. 

Alison has to make personal sacrifices in order to be able to accommodate their needs because owning a pet is a "lifelong commitment".

"I will always go without so my animals don't have to," she added.

Dr Manktelow believes that pet owners not being able to cover vet bills is taking a "huge toll" on the rehoming services at Blue Cross. 

He explained that it also has a "huge effect" on veterinary services because owners are delaying visiting them and then eventually presenting animals with worsened conditions. 

Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), believes that an ill pet can create real financial pressure, particularly alongside other cost of living concerns. 

She said: "It's really important that people get clear information and pricing to help them make the right choices."

CMA recommends comparing prices for treatment and services across different practices as well as looking into payment plans to help spread the cost.

Experts revealed that The Kremlin has rejected claims of potential Russian involvement in alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling them "ludicrous".

It comes after media reports that UK security officials are investigating a potential link following three incidents earlier this month.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: "London tends to suspect Russia of [involvement in] all the bad things happening in Great Britain. 

"As a rule, all these suspicions are groundless and not backed up with any evidence."

Three men, two Ukrainian nationals and a Romanian man, have been charged as part of a police investigation into the attacks.

Several UK newspapers have claimed MI5 is investigating the possibility the attacks were ordered by the Kremlin, citing unnamed Whitehall officials. 

Last week, Ukrainian national Petro Pochynok, 34, from north London, was charged by the Metropolitan Police with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.

Two other men have also been charged in connection with the fires. Roman Lavrynovych, 21, has been charged with arson with intent to endanger life, while Stanislav Carpiuc, 26,  has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.

The three men, who have already appeared in court for initial hearings, have been remanded in custody until the next scheduled hearing at the Old Bailey in London on 6 June.

On 8 May, a car the prime minister had sold to a neighbour caught fire on the Kentish Town street where he lived before moving to Downing Street.

Three days later, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of an Islington house, where Sir Keir lived during the 1990s and which has since been converted into flats.

On 12 May, the fire brigade and police were called to a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street as where the car fire took place.

Sir Keir previously described the incidents as "an attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for".

Downing Street and the Metropolitan Police have so far declined to comment on reports that potential Russian involvement is being investigated.

According to new developments, Jones has won 35 caps for Ireland

Ireland hooker Neve Jones believes there is "no ceiling" for her side as they prepare for the start of the Rugby World Cup next month.

Scott Bemand's side will face Japan, Spain and New Zealand in Pool C in the tournament in England.

Jones, who was part of the Irish side that failed to qualify for the last World Cup in 2021, has urged her side to show up on the big stage as they look to progress out of the group stage.

"We've been on an incredible journey, from coming last in the Six Nations two years ago to the World Cup, but the coaching staff and players we've all bought into everything," she told BBC Sport.

"We are all on the same page and we want to strive for excellence. There's no ceiling for us and it's about showing up and putting in performances."

Jones, who featured in Saturday's 27-21 win over Scotland, has picked up three winners' medals in three years at Gloucester-Hartpury since making the switch from Malone in 2022.

She is pleased that she has been able to enjoy an upturn of results with Ireland after some tough years playing for her country that coincided with sustained success at club level.

"I would have really good seasons at Gloucester and then to come here and pull on the green jersey is something you are proud to do, but it was a difficult time for sure," she added.

"We knew what we wanted to do in Ireland, it was just a matter of how we go from not playing so well to building every block to get better, which we have done."

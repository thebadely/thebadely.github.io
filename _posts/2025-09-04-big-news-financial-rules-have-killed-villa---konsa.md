According to new developments, Konsa was sent off in Villa's opening game of the 2025-26 season against Newcastle United

Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa says financial restrictions "killed" the club in the summer transfer window.

Villa's only major permanent transfer came early in August when they signed striker Evann Guessand from Nice for Â£26m and Â£4.3m in add-ons.

They then sold academy product Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle United for Â£40m before only adding to manager Unai Emery's squad on transfer deadline day.

They brought in Liverpool's Harvey Elliott and Manchester United's Jadon Sancho on loan, plus free agent Victor Lindelof, as they navigated limits on spending.

Villa were fined by Uefa in July for breaching the European governing body's financial rules and could have been prevented from registering new players for the Europa League this season if they did not have a positive transfer balance by the end of the summer transfer window.

On top of that, the Birmingham club, like their top-flight counterparts, also have to adhere to profit and sustainability rules (PSR) which state that clubs cannot post losses of more than Â£105m over a three-year reporting cycle.

"It is crazy. I don't understand it myself, but from the outside looking in it doesn't look too good. I know that. I know it's really killed us this transfer window," said Konsa, who is on international duty with England.

Villa were sixth in the Premier League last season as they missed out on fifth spot and Champions League qualification by finishing below Newcastle United on goal difference.

According to FootballTransfers.com, Villa had the third lowest outlay in the top-flight this summer as they spent Â£57.5m and recouped Â£47m to end with a Â£10.5m surplus.

"We're going to have to deal with what we've got now," said Konsa.

"I definitely didn't watch that [transfer deadline day]. It's been tough, especially for us.

"I knew that signing players was going to be difficult for us so I did not look at transfer deadline day.

"Around eight o'clock I went on Villa's social media to see what happened. I saw that we signed three players, who are really good and have Premier League experience.

"I think that's what we needed as well."

Villa have gained just one point - which came from a goalless draw against Newcastle - from their first three games of this season.

Konsa is hopeful they can turn their fortunes around after the international break.

"We've a great squad, I believe in our squad. I believe in our manager," he said.

"Hopefully the boys who have come in can really help us and push us on."

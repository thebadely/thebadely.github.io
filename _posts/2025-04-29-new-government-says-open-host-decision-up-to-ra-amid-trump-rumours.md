According to new developments, US president Donald Trump purchased Turnberry in 2014

The UK government says it is up to the R&A to decide the hosts of the Open Championship following claims US president Donald Trump has made repeated requests for the 2028 event to be held at his Turnberry course.

President Trump and White House officials have reportedly spoken to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about the Open returning to the Ayrshire venue, which last hosted the event in 2009.

BBC Sport has been told by several sources that the UK government has asked the R&A about its position on the matter in recent months.

A spokesman for the prime minister did not deny those claims, but said any contact the government had with sporting bodies was "part of the business of government" and not hosting decisions.

"I wouldn't get into specific conversations but it's for sporting bodies to make decisions on tournament venues, not the government," the spokesman said.

"Obviously the government is in regular contact with sporting bodies on tournaments in the usual way but not beyond that."

A spokesman for the R&A said: "We regularly engage with government and local government regarding venues.

"We have explained the logistical challenges around Turnberry to the government and they are aware of the position."

President Trump purchased Turnberry five years after it last hosted the Open and has since spent Â£200m on improvements. In 2023 he publicly called for it to host the Open again.

New R&A chief executive Mark Darbon said last week he "would love" the course to host the tournament again, and that logistical issues are the stumbling block, not who owns it.

The number of spectators attending the Open has dramatically increased since 120,000 people attended Turnberry in 2009, with 278,000 spectators set to attend this year's event at Royal Portrush.

A feasibility survey has been commissioned to assess whether the venue and town is equipped to cope with such numbers, with question marks over transport and accommodation.

Darbon's stance is a significant shift from that of his predecessor, Martin Slumbers, who had strongly suggested the course would not be restored to the Open rota while Trump was associated with the venue, expressing concerns that the focus would be off the course.

That led to suggestions that Whitehall officials have pushed for the Open to return to Turnberry, with ministers keen to please Trump in the wake of his tariff policy and ongoing trade talks between the two countries.

Sources from both sides deny any pressure has been applied.

In February, it was reported that White House officials raised the possibility of Turnberry returning as a venue for the Open during the prime minster's visit to Washington. King Charles even referenced the course in a letter inviting the president to a second state visit to the UK.

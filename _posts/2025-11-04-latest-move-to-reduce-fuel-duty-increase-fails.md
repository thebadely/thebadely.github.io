According to new developments, An attempt to limit an increase in fuel duty in Policy and Resources' 2026 budget for Guernsey has failed. 

Deputies voted by six votes to 30 to reject the move from deputies Jayne Ozanne and Liam McKenna to increase fuel duty by 2.3% rather than 4.3%.

During debate on the proposal, Ozanne said she did not feel there was anything in the budget to support islanders on middle incomes. 

P&R President Lindsay de Sausmarez argued her committee's budget did support people struggling with the cost of living through a £600 increase in personal income tax allowances. 

De Sausmarez said her committee, alongside Environment and Infrastructure, were looking at how tax on transport could be reformed.

In debate on the motion, Ozanne said she had been contacted by a number of members of the public who felt the current system of fuel tax was unfair. 

She said: "There is a deep-seated belief that our current policy is unfair as it taxes those who cannot afford electric vehicles hardest.

"To put more of the tax burden on them is unfair and deeply irresponsible."

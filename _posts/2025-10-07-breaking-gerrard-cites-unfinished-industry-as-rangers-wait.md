Let's dive into the details: Steven Gerrard (centre) said he had his staff "to a tee" at Rangers, working with Garry McAllister (left) and Michael Beale

Rangers are awaiting confirmation over whether their former manager Steven Gerrard is interested in a return to Ibrox.

The club are open to reappointing the ex-Liverpool captain following the sacking of boss Russell Martin. 

In an interview with former England team-mate Rio Ferdinand, the Liverpool great spoke of his desire to return to management but wants "to be at a team that's going to compete to win because I think that suits me better".

Rangers are in the process of appointing a new head coach following the sacking of  Martin, who won just five of his 17 matches.

Gerrard is among the names under consideration by the Ibrox hierarchy as they look to finalise a shortlist of candidates.

The club's American owners had been interested in the 45-year-old after completing their takeover in the summer, but it is understood a number of issues resulted in Gerrard withdrawing from the running.

In an interview with the Rio Ferdinand Presents Podcast, external, the ex-Anfield captain said there had been "five or six really interesting phone calls" since he left Saudi Arabian club Al-Ettifaq in January.

"I haven't been ready because I haven't got that [coaching] team set around me. And the timing hasn't been right," he explained.

"My daughter's just had a baby. I've just become a grandad. I wasn't ready. I haven't got my staff ready.

"So unfortunately, those opportunities have come at the wrong time, if you like.

"But if the right call comes my way, the right club, the right challenge, and I've got my people set, which I will have at some point, I'll take that challenge on because it's in me."

Gerrard was in charge at Ibrox from 2018 to 2021, winning the title in his last season.

"I know where I'm strong and I know there's areas where I need good support and I need special skill sets to make me better and stronger in terms of my staff and my group," he added.

"I felt like I had that to a tee at Rangers [with Gary McAllister and Michael Beale]. A lot of coach changes at Aston Villa and over in Saudi, I don't think helped me from a personal point of view.

"I'd love another go at some point.

"I want to change a few things and improve a few things and come back fresh, with  a few different people around myself. 

"I'd love another couple of challenges doing this and that's what I'm working on in the background at the moment.

"A few different ideas, a few different people around me.

"Now I'm enjoying family time and doing a lot of things that I haven't been able to do. But there's a part of me that still feels that there's a bit of unfinished business in terms of wanting to go in and face another couple of exciting challenges."

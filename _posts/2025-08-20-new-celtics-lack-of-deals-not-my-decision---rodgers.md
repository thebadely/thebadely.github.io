Celtic frustrated at home by Kazakhs Kairat

Manager Brendan Rodgers insists the failure to strengthen Celtic's squad for their Champions League play-off with Kairat was "not my decision" and concedes that he has to "accept where it's at".

The Scottish champions - heavy favourites to progress - were listless in being held to a goalless draw by their Kazakhstan counterparts.

Now they must travel more than 3,500 miles for next Tuesday's second leg, just short of the Chinese border, knowing they need a far better showing if they are to return to the top table of continental competition this season.

Celtic have recruited seven players this summer, paying fees for Benjamin Nygren, Hayato Inamura, Shin Yamada and Callum Osmand, with Kieran Tierney and Ross Doohan arriving on frees and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey on loan. 

Only Nygren and Tierney started on Wednesday, while the likes of Nicolas Kuhn and Kyogo Furuhashi - who starred in the Champions League last term - have been sold and not replaced, while Jota is out injured long term.

"We need to improve the squad," Rodgers said. "There's been clarity around that for a long time. Supporters see that. Hopefully between now and the end of the season, the club will get that and that will support us.

"It's not my decision in the end. I can prepare the players that are here. We are clear on where we need to improve, and for whatever reason we haven't been able to. 

"There's only so many ways that I can dress up that we don't have the players here. It was pretty clear. You don't need to look into the future too far. 

"You know these games are tough and you want to have players in as quick as you can. But it is what it is. I have to accept where it's at."

Rodgers has voiced his frustration already this summer about the lack of signings that would strengthen his starting XI.

His patience snapped during an interview following Friday's Premier Sports Cup win over Falkirk but he did concede there is still time for deals to be done before the window closes late on Monday, 1 September.

Bear in mind that, at this stage last season, Auston Trusty, Arne Engels and Luke McCowan had yet to arrive and Adam Idah was still holding a scarf above his head.

However, that was lost on the fans who chanted 'sack the board' during the draw with Kairat.

"What I do know is 'sack the board' usually means 'sack the manager'. It's normally the manager that goes when that starts to be sung," Rodgers said wryly.

'We need to improve the squad' - Rodgers

Lorenzo: Celtic cannot progress while the same faces run the show with their regular-managed decline.

Kenny: Low-ball bids, gambling on a play off. The disgust in Brendan Rodgers is the same as every fan. Signing projects hoping one out of five sells for Â£20m. Shocking.

Rufus: Teflon Brendan - no matter what happens, it's always someone else's fault. Either the board of the players.

Graham: The usual from Rodgersâ¦blah blah blah.

Andy: The issue with signings is not fees, it's timing. Jota is out long term, Kuhn was sold weeks ago. So the club are presumably signing two wingers. And yet we can't get one signed before the important games have started. It's the same for years.

Tony: The transfer dealings aren't good enough but maybe we also need to look at Rodgers' failure to evolve in terms of set up. A team of players who go side to side with no one willing to try something different to create space for a forward pass.

Rory: That one is on Rodgers and the players. Should have beaten them with what we had.

Dave: Rodgers has the perfect excuse to leave after this season, lack of urgency and quality about this team. The board have rolled the dice and failed, this is on them.

Ivor: Brendan working his ticket again? Fans going to hound out Peter Lawwell again? Just lucky Rangers haven't got their act together. Sack the board.

Michelle: Not nearly good enough. Kyogo and Kuhn are long gone and Idah is not anywhere near the standard we need.

Wullie: "Sack the board"? Absolutely hilarious. The Celtic board is to blame for the failure of a team of millionaires and its millionaire manager to beat a team from Kazakhstan? 

Eric: You get what you pay for!

John: Lack of re investment of the transfer revenue clearly demonstrates the lack of ambition of the club.

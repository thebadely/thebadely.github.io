According to new developments, A mum who has campaigned for legal reforms to give parents access to children's social media accounts after their death has been appointed an MBE.

Ellen Roome, 49, has been recognised for her work in children's online safety, after fighting for change following the death of her son Jools Sweeney, 14, in 2022. She believes he died after an online challenge went wrong.

Jools was found unconscious in his bedroom in April 2022 and an inquest found he took his own life. But a coroner said it was unlikely he intended to end his life and the exact events leading up to his death were unclear.

Ms Roome believes Jools' social media accounts could provide answers but she has been unable to access them. 

She campaigns for bereaved parents to be able to access their children's social media after their death. 

She said receiving the letter with her award had been "very bizarre". 

"I didn't do this at all for any recognition so it's bittersweet because I'd give it back in a heartbeat to have my son here," Ms Roome said.

"I just felt like I was a mum shouting this is fundamentally wrong, and somebody's listened which is nice."

"I've tried to make Jools' life public to make it safe for other children that are still alive. This is all about making a difference for the children that are still here and the ones we can still save.

"I'm not a law maker, I'm a campaigner to make this a better place so I just say it from the heart how I think it should be."

Ms Roome said her friends and family would be pleased for her honour, but she mainly wonders how Jools would feel. 

"I think he'd be very proud. I like to think somewhere he's looking down and thinking 'well done mum, keep going'."

Her parliamentary petition successfully triggered a debate in January, raising awareness about the issue of data access. It is due to go back to Parliament and she said she hopes it could get Royal Assent by March.

Ms Roome said she believed digital checks should form part of the post-mortem and inquest process, similar to a toxicology report to look for drugs and alcohol.

Elsewhere, ex-Chief Executive of NHS Gloucestershire Integrated Care Board, Mary Hutton, has been appointed CBE, while Prof David Main, Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the Royal Agricultural University said he was "honoured and delighted" to have been awarded a British Empire Medal.

They are among nine people recognised across Gloucestershire.

Ms Hutton said she was "deeply honoured" to receive a CBE for her work in community wellbeing, health and care.

She spent more than 30 years with the NHS and championed practical support for communities and improved services for children and young people, older people, and people living with long-term conditions or disabilities.

Ms Hutton has also supported young people and youth services outside the NHS, volunteering for charitable and community organisations over many years.

"It has been a privilege to work alongside such committed staff and supportive partners across Gloucestershire," she said.

"Over the years, we've achieved a great deal together for local people, from improving wellbeing to strengthening services [and] this honour reflects those shared efforts over 14 years.

"And I'm truly grateful for the support I've had throughout my career."

Prof Main has been recognised for services to animal welfare, in his role as Chair of the Animals in Science Committee.

The award recognised the committee's efforts in its oversight of legislation protecting the welfare of animals used in scientific research.

"The committee strives to balance the impacts on animals with benefits to people including assessing the safety and efficacy of medicines," he said.

Orlando Fraser KC, chair of the Charity Commission, was also a recipient of a CBE, while Elena Goulding, UN Goodwill Ambassador, and Gavin Webb, an officer in the National Crime Agency, were both appointed OBE.

MBE recipients included Michael Henriques, Chair, County Air Ambulance HELP Appeal, and Robert Jenkins for services to the community in the Forest of Dean. 

Barry Turner was also recognised for services to the community in Oldbury‑on‑Severn.

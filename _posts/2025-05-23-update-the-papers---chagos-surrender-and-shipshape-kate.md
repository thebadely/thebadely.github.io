It has been recently reported that The cost of the deal to transfer the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius is the lead for the Telegraph and the Times - which both question the prime minister's claim that the total "net cost" of the deal to maintain a key military base there over a century would be roughly £3.2bn.

The Telegraph says its own analysis shows it is more likely to be around £30bn, a figure also suggested by the Conservatives. 

It quotes the shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, as saying that Labour are lying to British taxpayers with their "dodgy accounting". 

The Times quotes Sir Keir who says the deal represents "value for money" with the cost "the same as running an aircraft carrier minus the aircraft".

The government's plans to release some prisoners in England and Wales early is the lead in the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. 

The Express has spoken to the Justice for Victims campaign group - which includes the parents of Sarah Everard who was murdered by a policeman in 2021. 

The paper says the group has described the plans as an "insult to all victims".

The i Paper carries a warning from former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove that the Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's net zero plan is a threat to national security.

Sir Richard highlights the risk of using Chinese technology in UK wind farms, solar panels and electric cars because the microchips in products could be controlled remotely - leaving the UK "dangerously vulnerable".

The Mirror reports that Manchester United is "open" to bids for any of its men's players, after the club's failure to qualify for European football next season. 

The paper says this has left it with a £100m "hole" in its finances. "Reds alert" is the headline.

According to research reported in the Times, dogs are increasingly being seem as "child surrogates" by their owners who choose to have a pet over a baby. 

The paper says a study, published in the European Psychologist journal, noted that owning a dog could offer an opportunity to fulfil a nurturing drive similar to parenting but with fewer demands than raising "biological offspring". 

It says the trend may be contributing to the declining birthrate in Western countries - which has been happening in the UK since 2010.

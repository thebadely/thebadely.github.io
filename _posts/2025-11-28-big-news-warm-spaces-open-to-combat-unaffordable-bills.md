According to new developments, People in a county are being encouraged to use warm spaces over winter if they need to, with many continuing to face "unaffordable" heating bills, a council said.

More than 170 venues including libraries, village halls, churches and community hubs across Northamptonshire are offering support in a "non-judgemental" environment. 

The spaces are run by community groups, voluntary and not-for profit organisations, supported by West and North Northamptonshire councils.

It is hoped the spaces will offer people "important connection through the winter months," said Gregory Wilcox, of North Northamptonshire Council.

There are 43 organisations welcoming residents across North Northamptonshire and a further 129 across West Northamptonshire.

The spaces are free to residents of all ages and offer warmth and the chance to socialise. 

"Residents struggling with heating their homes due to the rising cost of living can go for warmth, to look after physical and mental health, and to access support information," North Northamptonshire Council said.

People are also being encouraged to share details with any residents who are unable to access the lists online. 

"North Northamptonshire Council recognises that once again it will be unaffordable for many residents to heat their homes for as long as they would do normally again this winter," said Wilcox, Reform UK executive member for communities at North Northamptonshire Council.

"The Warm Spaces initiative has been running for a few years now and as well as offering a place of warmth, they are also places offering residents dignity and hopefully also some very important connection through the winter months."

West Northamptonshire Council said it had handed out grants worth up to £1,500 to groups and organisations involved in the scheme. 

Laura Couse, Reform UK cabinet member for adult care and public health at the authority, said: "Through this grant scheme, we're proud to help local organisations create safe, warm and inclusive environments where people can connect, access support and feel a sense of belonging."

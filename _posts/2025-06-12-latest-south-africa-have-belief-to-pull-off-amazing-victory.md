Cummins reaches 300th Test wicket milestone with final evenly poised

South Africa's players have "massive belief" they can pull off a sensational victory in the World Test Championship final, says batter David Bedingham.

Australia initially put themselves in a strong position on day two, dismissing the Proteas for 138 in response to their own first-innings total of 212.

But South Africa roared back into the contest in the second half of the day as Australia collapsed to 144-8 - a lead of 218 - to leave the match on a knife edge.

Australia captain Pat Cummins said the contest is "50-50" in terms of who will emerge as victor.

And Bedingham, who top scored for South Africa in their first innings with 45, said his side will not be daunted but instead relish an "amazing chance" to secure a famous win at the home of cricket.

"We're all very, very excited about the opportunity to win. It could go either way," Bedingham said.

"When they started batting in their second innings, I think we would have definitely taken 144-8. 

"So we are very confident and I think there's a massive belief in this team."

If Australia fail to add any more runs on day three South Africa would still be facing the fifth-highest Test run chase in Lord's history.

Bedingham believes a positive approach from his side's batters will be the best way to take on the challenge when they get the opportunity to bat on day three.

"I think we definitely showed more intent today. I think that will probably be the way we go about it," he added.

"The main thing is just to 100% commit if you're defending or attacking. As soon as you get caught in two minds against these attacks, I think you get found out."

Australia lost five batters for just 29 runs - their fourth biggest collapse between the third and seventh wicket - to blow open the World Test Championship final.

Here's how it happened:

17.5 overs â Labuschagne c Verreynne b Jansen 22 (Aus 44-3) â Labuschagne plays a loose drive and edges behind to wicketkeeper Verreynne.

18.5 overs â Smith lbw b Ngidi 13 (Aus 48-4) â South Africa successfully review an lbw against Smith, who plays across the line and is struck on his back pad in line with off stump.

22.6 overs â Webster lbw b Ngidi 9 (Aus 64-5) â A wide delivery angles back in, beats Webster's inside edge and hits his back leg in front of middle stump.

23.4 overs â Head b Mulder 9 (Aus 66-6) â Mulder pitches the ball outside off and gets it to nip back past Head's inside edge and into off stump.

24.5 overs â Cummins b Ngidi 6 (Aus 73-7) â Ngidi bowls a yorker which hits Cummins on the pads and ricochets into the stumps.

Six-wicket haul helps Cummins' reach 300 dismissals in Test career

Australia skipper Cummins put his side's collapse down to a "tricky" Lord's pitch, and "disciplined" bowling from South Africa.

Lungi Ngidi and Kagiso Rabada picked up 3-35 and 3-44 respectively while Marco Jansen and Wiaan Mulder also claimed one apiece.

Cummins said: "I think it's a mixture of the wicket still doing a little bit. It feels like just when it's not doing anything, one ball will suddenly seam quite drastically. 

"Both teams are kind of just hanging in that good length area, pretty tight line. I think the fast bowling from South Africa looked pretty tricky and the wicket has got enough in it to make it even more tricky."

Cummins, who reached 300 Test wickets after he took 6-28, said any runs his side can eke out for their last two wickets could be vital.

"I am so happy we got 200. Hopefully we get another 20 or 30 in the morning," he added.

"I think they'd give us a few more options to bowl, you know. A few more aggressive fields and those kind of things. 

"I think it's pretty close to 50-50 and that's a pretty good Test match."

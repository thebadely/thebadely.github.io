Experts revealed that Noah Dettwiler began his racing career aged seven in the Swiss Supermoto Cup

Moto3 rider Noah Dettwiler is no longer in a critical condition after being involved in a serious crash at the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday.

Dettwiler, 20, underwent several successful surgeries but remained in a "stable but still critical" condition after colliding with Moto3 world champion Jose Antonio Rueda during a sighting lap before their race.

Moto3 is the entry-level class below Moto2 and MotoGP.

"According to the doctors, Noah's condition is now stable and no longer critical," the rider's CIP Green Power team and his family said in a statement on Wednesday.

"He will continue to be monitored closely in the intensive care unit. 

"Thank you for all your continued support and kindness." 

Both riders were airlifted to hospital before the race, which was delayed and shortened.

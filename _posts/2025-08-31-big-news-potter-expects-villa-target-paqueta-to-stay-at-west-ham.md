Potter 'confident' Paqueta will remain at West Ham

West Ham head coach Graham Potter expects midfielder Lucas Paqueta to remain at the club after the transfer window closes despite interest from Aston Villa. 

Villa held talks with the Hammers over a loan move with an obligation to buy, with sources telling BBC Sport initial discussions have centred around a total package of about Â£50m including the loan fee before the deal is made permanent next summer.

The 28-year-old started for West Ham in the 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest on Sunday. He netted a late penalty before celebrating by making a phone sign with his hand, throwing it over his shoulder and kissing the West Ham badge in front of the travelling fans. 

When asked by BBC Match of the Day if the Brazilian will remain at the club after Monday's deadline, Potter simply replied: "Yes. 

"The noise has been around Lucas for a long time and the way he conducts himself is incredible. 

"He gave everything for the team again today and contributed with a goal and the win."

Hammers captain Jarrod Bowen told fans to "not believe everything you read online".

"Some people didn't think he'd turn up and play but he turned up and scored."

Tottenham and Everton also hold an interest in Paqueta.

Premier League highlights: Nottingham Forest 0-3 West Ham

West Ham came into this game with two defeats in their opening two Premier League games before they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup at Wolves on Tuesday night. 

With tensions running high following captain Bowen's confrontation with a section of the travelling support at Molineux, this win at the City Ground came at a great time for the Hammers. 

Potter told the BBC: "It's what we're here for - to win and prove we have the quality and prove we are a team. 

"We can enjoy the next couple of days and prepare when the boys are back.

"I have been a manager for 15 years, relatively competent sometimes, but it's the players - it's their day today. 

"They've carried out the win in a really good way. We restricted Forest and carried a threat ourselves."

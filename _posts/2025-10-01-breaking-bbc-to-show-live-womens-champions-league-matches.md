It has been recently reported that Arsenal beat Barcelona 1-0 in Lisbon in May to win the Women's Champions League for the second time

BBC Sport has signed a five-year deal to broadcast live Women's Champions League matches from this season.

The contract, which runs until 2030, means up to seven live matches - including the final - will be available to watch each season across BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Other matches will include both legs of one semi-final and four matches from earlier in the competition.

The best moments from other games will also be available across BBC Sport's digital platforms and social media.

Manchester United's match with Paris St-Germain at Old Trafford on 12 November will be the first game to be shown on the BBC, followed by Chelsea's meeting with Spanish giants Barcelona on 20 November.

BBC Radio 5 Live will continue to bring live commentary of the biggest games throughout the season.

Director of BBC Sport Alex Kay-Jelski said: "This is a great moment for women's football and for BBC Sport.

"Bringing the Uefa Women's Champions League to a free-to-air audience is huge, but what makes this truly game-changing is our digital offering.

"Our multi-platform strategy means fans won't just watch the biggest games live on TV, they'll experience the best moments, goals and highlights across our website, app and social media platforms.

"We're making the competition more accessible, more visible and more connected than ever before".

Ben Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast. New episodes drop every Tuesday on BBC Sounds, plus find interviews and extra content from the Women's Super League and beyond on the Women's Football Weekly feed

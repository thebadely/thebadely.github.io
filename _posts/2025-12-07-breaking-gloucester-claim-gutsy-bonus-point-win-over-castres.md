Investec Champions Cup

Gloucester held their nerve to beat Castres 34-14 on their return to the Champions Cup after a two-year absence on a wild afternoon at Kingsholm.

With the score tied at 14-14, the Cherries were reduced to 14 men for 10 minutes when Deian Gwynne was sent to the sin-bin.

But two vital penalties from Ross Byrne after the sin-bin period ended gave Gloucester breathing space before Charlie Atkinson scored two late tries.

Castres scored converted tries from Vuate Karawalevu and Loris Zarantonello before half-time, with Gloucester's Freddie Thomas and Will Trenholm going over for tries converted by Byrne as both sides defied the howling wind.

Errors crept in after the break, and then Gwynne was shown a yellow card after his hand connected with the eye area of Florent Vanverberghe.

But the French Top 14 side lost their discipline in the closing stages, with Christian Ambadiang and Gauthier Doubrere also being sent to the sin-bin.

The late tries for substitute Atkinson sealed a bonus-point win for the Cherries in their first match in the competition since 2022-23.

The game had started badly for the hosts when Karawalevu intercepted to stroll over from halfway for the opening try, but Wales international Tomas Williams fed second row Thomas for Gloucester's first score.

Castres hooker Zarantonello bundled over for what proved to be their final score, despite the French side playing with the strong wind behind them after the break.

Trenholm was shown to have reached the line by a television match official review, after the try had initially been ruled out on the pitch, meaning the game reached 14-14 by the break.

Gloucester struggled with their line-out while Castres gave away numerous penalties in a frantic second half, but the Cherries resisted the visitors despite being a player down in Gwynne's absence.

Byrne's penalties gave the hosts the edge, and Atkinson's two fine tries capped a spirited performance that earned Gloucester second spot in Pool 2, behind local rivals Bath on points difference, ahead of the Edinburgh-Toulon fixture.

Gloucester director of rugby George Skivington said on Premier Sports: "I'm really pleased with the result. If we looked at the result we'd have taken that before the game.

"We made it difficult in some areas but the boys' work-rate, there were some sticky spots that they found their way out of, we found an ugly win but we'll take that. You can see our game coming through.

"I think we lost 10 line-outs or something ridiculous like that which kills a lot of your attacking platform, but I think when we had the ball we created things and we're getting there."

Gloucester travel to Thomond Park to take on Munster at 17:30 GMT on Saturday, 13 December, while Castres will host Edinburgh at 13:00 on Sunday, 14 December.

Let's dive into the details: Wilson joined West Ham in the summer after five years at Newcastle

West Ham have blocked plans for striker Callum Wilson to leave the club this month after putting talks over his contract termination on hold.

Wilson was in advanced discussions with the club over releasing him from his contract that expires in the summer.

But a leading Hammers official has stepped in to end those discussions, with Wilson now set to stay at the London Stadium until the end of the season.

The development comes after Wilson scored a last minute winner in the London derby versus Tottenham on Saturday.

And it has been decided internally that it would be self-defeating to allow Wilson to leave with the club desperately in need of goals in their fight to stay in the Premier League.

Wilson joined the club on a free transfer in the summer, scoring five goals in 19 appearances.

But the Englishman's first-team opportunities looked set to become limited following the arrival of forwards of Pablo Felipe and Tati Castellanos this month.

As a result Wilson and West Ham had entered into talks over terminating his deal, in a move that would allow him to find another club as a free transfer.

But those plans have now been put on hold, with the 33-year-old expected to stay until the summer.

Speaking earlier this month, Hammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo confirmed talks over his potential exit, saying: "Me and Callum we had a lot of conversations, just 10 minutes ago we were speaking about that situation.

"Two strikers have joined, correct. I personally decided these strikers have joined. Callum is a very experienced man, he's been in the game for so much time, he knows that his position has changed.

"We were honest with each other. Yes, your position has changed, but you are still a player for the club and we still maybe need him and he should help us because he joined us."

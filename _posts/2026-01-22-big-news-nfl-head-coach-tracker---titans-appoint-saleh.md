Let's dive into the details: Robert Saleh's only previous head coach role was with the New York Jets from 2021 to 2024

The NFL's latest hiring cycle is in full swing with four head coaches having been appointed following the end of the regular season.

The Tennessee Titans are the latest team to sign a new head coach, with Robert Saleh joining after a season as defensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers.

John Harbaugh has taken charge of the New York Giants, Kevin Stefanski has been handed the Atlanta Falcons job and the Miami Dolphins have hired Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. 

That leaves six head coach vacancies - you can follow the latest updates on each team's recruitment process below.

The Tennessee Titans were the first team to fire their head coach this season when they sacked Brian Callahan in October, with Mike McCoy acting as interim for the rest of the campaign as they ended with a 3-14 record.

Saleh was New York Jets head coach from 2021 until he was sacked in 2024, with the 46-year-old returning to his former role as the 49ers' defensive coordinator for the past season after a stint as an offensive consultant for the Packers.

He has also previously had coaching roles with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Seattle Seahawks and Houston Texans.

"This was the most desirable location, the most desirable team," said Saleh.

"The people here are unbelievable, and they're the type of people you want to work with."

The Titans are believed to have also spoken to former Packers and Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy and Mike McDaniel, who was fired as Dolphins head coach earlier this month.

The New York Giants were one of two teams to sack their head coach mid-season and they acted swiftly after Harbaugh was released by the Baltimore Ravens upon missing out on the play-offs.

Harbaugh was the most sought-after coach during this cycle after an 18-year spell with Baltimore and the 2013 Super Bowl champion interviewed with Atlanta and planned to meet with Tennessee.

But the Giants were the first team to welcome the 63-year-old to their training facility and they agreed a reported five-year deal, making Harbaugh one of the NFL's highest-paid coaches.

Stefanski interviewed with the Giants, Baltimore, Tennessee, Las Vegas and Miami having twice been named Coach of the Year during six seasons in charge of the Cleveland Browns.

But the 43-year-old will replace Raheem Morris as the Atlanta Falcons coach on a reported five-year contract.

Harbaugh was the second-longest serving coach in the NFL behind long-term divisional rival Mike Tomlin, who chose to end his 19-year spell with the Pittsburgh Steelers after they lost in the first round of the play-offs.

The Steelers are now looking for just their fourth head coach since 1969 and are reportedly scheduled to speak to McCarthy, plus former Miami head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive co-ordinator Brian Flores.

They are also one of several teams who have interviewed or are hoping to interview Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula.

The Baltimore Ravens have interviewed multiple candidates, including Flores and his Miami successor McDaniel.

The Rams' pass-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak have been interviewed by multiple teams, including the Ravens.

McDermott was the Buffalo Bills coach for nine seasons but despite having star quarterback Josh Allen and winning the AFC East on five occasions, he was unable to reach a Super Bowl.

The 51-year-old was sacked after the Bills' 33-30 play-off overtime defeat by the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.

The Cleveland Browns are the third AFC North team hiring this cycle and have interviewed McDaniel as well as Baltimore offensive coordinator Todd Monken and Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski.

Atlanta and Cleveland have interviewed Seattle's British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has helped the Seahawks clinch the NFC's top seed and go within one win of the Super Bowl having booked a spot in next Sunday's NFC Championship game.

The Miami Dolphins named Hafley as their new head coach following the sacking of McDaniel.

Hafley, 46, spent two seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Packers and has also held roles as an assistant coach with the 49ers, Cleveland and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

"I believe great things are ahead for the Miami Dolphins with Jeff Hafley leading the way," said Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. 

"He has tenacity and grit, while at the same time establishing trust with his players in order to get the most out of them."

The Las Vegas Raiders are seeking a replacement for Pete Carroll and, as of Monday, had conducted interviews with 14 candidates, including McDaniel and Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator, who was born in Colchester.

The Raiders have spoken to Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy as well, with the Arizona Cardinals having also interviewed the ex-Chicago Bears head coach as they look for Jonathan Gannon's successor.

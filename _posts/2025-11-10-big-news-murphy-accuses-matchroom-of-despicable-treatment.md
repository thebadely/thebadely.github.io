According to new developments, England's Shaun Murphy won the World Championship in 2005

Shaun Murphy has accused snooker promoters Matchroom of "despicable" treatment over the timing of his match at the Champion of Champions tournament.

World number nine Murphy lost 4-1 to Lei Peifan of China in the 16-player invitational knockout at Leicester's Mattioli Arena.

The 43-year-old Englishman felt aggrieved that he had to play the opening game of the non-ranking event, having only just returned from the International Championship in China, where he reached the quarter-finals.

Murphy said he was asked to play first in the Champion of Champions despite a "marathon 36-hour journey" back to the UK even though the promoters "hand pick the draw".

"For me to be thrown out first is nothing short of despicable, and I think they have covered themselves in a huge embarrassment by treating me with such disrespect," Murphy told ITV.

"I always pride myself on conducting myself as professionally as I can, try to treat the game with an incredible amount of respect.

"There are three other players in this tournament who weren't even in China last week. The way I have been treated by Matchroom in this tournament is nothing short of despicable."

In response, Matchroom said it spoke to Murphy afterwards and "share his frustrations". 

A statement read: "Our priorities are the players, we take pride in the fact they consider this event prestigious and want to prepare for it.

"For transparency and fairness, the groups [for the draw] are based on seeding. Scheduling is always a challenge every year, but we take on board the points and always strive to improve for next year and the future."

Lei, ranked 31st in the world, opened up a two-frame lead before Murphy reduced the deficit.

However, Lei responded with a break of 61 to take the fourth frame with Murphy unable to respond in the fifth.

Meanwhile, England's Judd Trump progressed to the semi-finals.

Trump claimed a 4-1 win over Bai Yulu of China in his opening match in a first meeting of the players.

Reigning women's world champion Bai, 22, won the opening frame of the first meeting between the players.

But men's world number one Trump held his nerve to win the next two frames with breaks of 84 and 71.

Trump then faced Murphy's conquerer Lei in the quarter-final and triumphed 6-2 with two breaks of 60 and one of 71.

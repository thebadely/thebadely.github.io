It has been recently reported that Tottenham are winless in their past 10 midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) Premier League games

Head coach Thomas Frank says Tottenham are "completely aligned" about the future as he faces pressure from fans to improve results.

Frank has declared that the club are united behind the scenes, saying that chief executive Vinai Venkatesham makes "sensible decisions" and is "is one of the best communicators I ever met".

Spurs were booed off after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Sunderland, and have won two of their past 11 Premier League games.

In the past week, Enzo Maresca has left Chelsea and Manchester United have sacked Ruben Amorim - with both head coaches departing amid fallouts with senior figures at their respective clubs.

But Frank says he has no such issues with Tottenham's hierarchy.

"I think the biggest thing is that we are completely aligned with the ownership," Frank said.

"Vinai is one of the best communicators I ever met, as a CEO, leader or whatever, he is absolutely excellent in that.

"I think I'm OK, but he is way superior, which I think is crucial internally and externally.

"He's calm and he takes sensible decisions - two rare abilities in football. He understands the journey we're on."

Tottenham, who visit Bournemouth on Wednesday, are in a congested mid-table, sitting 13th in the Premier League.

They are unbeaten in their past three matches, but have not scored from open play since 6 December.

Sporting director Fabio Paratici has continuously been linked with a move back to Italy with Fiorentina during recent weeks, but remains in place at Spurs.

Frank said: "We're paying his wage, he's working very hard.

"The last time I spoke to him? I spoke to him in the morning before the [Sunderland] game."

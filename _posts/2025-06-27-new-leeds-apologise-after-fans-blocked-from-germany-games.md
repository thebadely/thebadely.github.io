Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leeds United won the Championship title last season two earn promotion back to the Premier League

Leeds have apologised "unreservedly" after German authorities said their fans are unable to attend pre-season matches in the country.

The Whites will travel to Germany for an eight-day training camp as they prepare for their return to the Premier League.

Daniel Farke's side made a similar trip last summer and were asked by police and local authorities not to bring supporters because of the resources needed to host Euro 2024.

Leeds say they had "written assurances" from the German Football Association and their tour operator that fans could attend this year, but have now been told they cannot.

"Frustratingly, despite having matches agreed for a number of months, we have in the last week been informed that the police and local authorities will once again not grant a permit for us to play matches in front of spectators, will prohibit us from providing live updates and video streams, and have requested we discourage supporter travel," Leeds said in a statement.

"This comes despite multiple attempts to find a solution including offering various assurances, pursuing alternative scenarios that would allow for fan attendance, and even evaluating moving camp to a different location on short notice. 

"Unfortunately, those efforts were fruitless due to the last-second nature of our change in circumstances. 

"This result is deeply frustrating to all of us, just as it is sure to frustrate and anger you, our loyal supporters, to whom we apologise unreservedly for this outcome."

The Leeds United Supporters Trust said the club had not received "any sensible explanation" for the decision and will be contacting the German authorities.

"We respect the club and Daniel Farke's desire to keep a successful training camp in Germany, but would expect a valid reason from the authorities as to why once again Leeds United fans are being unduly excluded," the group said.

Leeds fans are able to attend pre-season friendlies against Manchester United in Stockholm and AC Milan in Dublin next month, as well as a home match against Villarreal on 2 August.

Farke's side begin their Premier League campaign at home to Everton on Monday 18 August.

Watch: Lindsey Vonn airlifted after crash in last race before Olympics

US alpine skier Lindsey Vonn says her "Olympic dream is not over" after being airlifted to hospital following a crash in her final race before the Winter Games.

The downhill race in Switzerland was part of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, but was cancelled for "adverse conditions" after Vonn became the third skier of the day to crash. 

She lost control after landing a jump on the course in Crans-Montana, before colliding into the safety netting.

Vonn later posted on social media that she had injured her left knee but insisted: "My Olympic dream is not over."

The 41-year-old said: "I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams.

"This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics... but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback.

"It's not over until it's over..."

The Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February with the downhill event scheduled for 8 February.

Lindsey Vonn will have a short recovery time before the Winter Olympics next week

After racing was cancelled on Friday, governing body the FIS announced: "Following difficulties experienced by the first six racers, the jury interrupted the race due to growing safety concerns. Athlete safety remained the top priority, with the jury ultimately deciding to cancel the competition."

Women's World Cup race director Peter Gerdol said that worsening visibility was behind the decision to cancel the race.

Vonn was in winning form before the start of the Games in Milan-Cortina next week, but after the crash looked in pain and was pictured clutching her left knee. 

She was able to ski to the finish but looked in discomfort, before being taken to hospital to be evaluated.

The American, who was Olympic downhill champion in 2010, made a comeback last season after nearly six years away from skiing. 

She did not compete in the 2022 Games in Beijing due to an ACL injury, but she later returned last season after a partial knee replacement. 

In December last year she became the oldest downhill ski World Cup winner with her victory in St Moritz, Switzerland.

Norway's Marte Monsen also collided with the side-netting and was stretchered away with a bloodied face.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Fallon Sherrock reached the third round of the PDC World Championships in 2020

Fallon Sherrock says she will not be back to her best for "a couple of years" and has indicated she plans to take a break from darts in 2026 for health reasons.

The 30-year-old became ill after the birth of her son Rory in 2014 and has suffered from kidney problems since then.

Sherrock has been a pioneering figure in darts since she became the first woman to win a match at the PDC World Championship in 2019.

In an interview with Online Darts, external, the English player said she is having to scale back on playing commitments because her energy levels are lower.

"I feel like it will be my B-game [at the moment] and I don't know if I am able to get my A-game out," Sherrock said.

"If I'm going to have a year out next year I want to make a bang this year. I want to try to get to everything even if I'm not playing 100%.

"I need to sort myself out, get myself well and then the sky is the limit."

Sherrock, who is nicknamed the 'Queen of the Palace', said she is "determined to keep fighting" and will continue to play for the time being despite the impact of her health issues.

"All I want to do is practise at home for a couple of hours a day and I can't do that at the moment, so it is difficult," she added.

"I've had to pull out of some exhibitions recently because I haven't had the stamina. 

"I have had to narrow down what I am playing in at the moment, and that hurts because I love darts. 

"Fingers crossed that in a couple of years' time I'll be alright and back to winning well."

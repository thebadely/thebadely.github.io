Experts revealed that Jannik Sinner was world number one until losing the US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz in September

Four-time Grand Slam champion Jannik Sinner will not be part of the Italy team aiming to clinch a third consecutive Davis Cup title next month.

The 24-year-old reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and won the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.

Sinner is scheduled to take part in the ATP Tour Finals in Turin from 9-16 November, but Italy captain Filippo Volandri said the world number two had "not given his availability" to play at the Davis Cup in Bologna from 18-23 November.

World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been named in Spain's team.

'Sport must adapt', says Draper after Rune injury

Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli, eighth and 22nd in the world respectively, will be the highest-ranked singles players on show for Italy, who face Austria in their quarter-final.

Volandri said: "The Davis Cup is, and will remain, always his home and I am sure that Jannik will soon be part of the team again.

"In the meantime, I can count on a group ready to fight and give everything for the blue jersey."

Sinner's absence, which is understood to be so he can have extra preparation time for the start of next season, comes after several players voiced concerns about a demanding tennis calendar in recent weeks.

After Holger Rune sustained a season-ending injury at the Nordic Open on Saturday, British number one Jack Draper posted on social media that "the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity".

Alcaraz said before the Six Kings Slam he feels players are misunderstood when they make such complaints but also play exhibition events - citing a reduced mental and physical toll at exhibitions compared with official ranking tournaments.

England dominate Scotland to set up semi-final with France

England surpassed their own record winning streak across both men's and women's international rugby union by defeating Scotland 40-8 in their Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final in Bristol.

In 2022, the Red Roses became the first team in history to win 25 Tests in a row by beating Wales in a World Cup warm-up game at Ashton Gate and that record was extended by five more victories - until it ended with a defeat by New Zealand at the World Cup final later that year.

Since that dramatic loss, England have not lost a Test and they broke new ground with a 31st consecutive win on Sunday.

If they are to lift the World Cup on 27 September at Twickenham, then the record will be extended to 33.

Here are the stats behind their incredible winning run.

Prior to losing the most recent World Cup final in Auckland, the Red Roses' previous defeat had come against the Black Ferns in 2019.

Not since a Women's Six Nations defeat by France in 2018 have England lost to a team other than the reigning world champions.

It has been 1,038 days (as of 15 September) since England have lost a game.

Who plays who in Rugby World Cup semi-finals?

The current 31-game winning run started under former head coach Simon Middleton, who, after the World Cup final defeat in 2022, led the Red Roses to a Women's Six Nations Grand Slam in 2023.

Since taking charge midway through the 2023 WXV1 campaign, John Mitchell has won 26 games as head coach, winning back-to-back WXV1 titles and successive Six Nations Grand Slams.

Mitchell remains undefeated as England head coach and is yet to lose a game in charge.

Mitchell chose to change the team's captain in January, with Zoe Aldcroft taking over from Marlie Packer, who had spent two seasons leading England.

Number eight Alex Matthews has also captained the side twice, most recently in England's final pool game of the World Cup against Australia in Brighton.

Former captain Sarah Hunter, who captained the Red Roses to the World Cup final in 2022, is now the side's defence coach.

England score 14 tries in record World Cup win over Samoa

The Red Roses' record 92-3 Women's Rugby World Cup win over Samoa is currently the biggest victory during the winning run.

In terms of the winning run nearly ending, England held off a late France fightback in this year's Six Nations Grand Slam finale to win 43-42.

Les Bleues also lost by five points in front of a record women's crowd of 58,498 at Twickenham in 2023.

World Cup contenders Canada lost by nine points at last year's WXV1 in Vancouver, conceding a try in the final play, while world champions New Zealand were defeated by 12 points at Twickenham last September.

Up next for England are France in Saturday's World Cup semi-final in Bristol.

England survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single point

Despite the dominance, England most recently won the World Cup in 2014 when they defeated Canada in the final.

The Red Roses have lost five of the past six finals, with all those losses coming against New Zealand.

Will they finally add a third Women's World Cup to go alongside their impressive winning record?

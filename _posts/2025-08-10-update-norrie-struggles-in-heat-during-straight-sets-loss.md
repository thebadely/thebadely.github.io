Experts revealed that Cameron Norrie has lost three matches in a row on the ATP Tour's North American swing

British number two Cameron Norrie is out of the Cincinnati Open after suffering a second-round loss to veteran Roberto Bautista Agut.

Norrie recently beat the world number 53 in four sets at Wimbledon, with his first-round win sparking a run to the quarter-finals at the All England Club.

As the 32nd seed in Ohio, Norrie had a first-round bye before meeting the 37-year-old Spaniard, but with the temperature passing 30C, he seemed to struggle in the heat on the way to a 6-4 6-3 defeat.

Norrie's last outing came at the Canadian Open, where he was beaten by world number 99 Aleksandar Vukic in the second round.

He continued his US Open preparations in Cincinnati and Bautista Agut did well to hold his serve following three lengthy games, while breaking Norrie's in the fourth game.

When serving at 5-2 down, Norrie was visibly drenched in sweat and changed his shirt prior to deuce before staving off two set points.

The 29-year-old then broke back to make it 5-4 - from his sixth break point - but served a double fault in the following game, allowing Bautista Agut to clinch the first set.

Norrie continued to look unwell during the second but remained competitive, saving five match points to cut his deficit to 5-3, despite serving three double faults.

But Bautista Agut, playing just his second match since Wimbledon, made no mistake on his second match point in the following game.

After Montreal, this is the second straight tournament Norrie has fallen at his first hurdle and he has lost three of his five matches since his run at SW19 was halted by world number two Carlos Alcaraz.

Spain's Alcaraz, who was denied a third straight Wimbledon title in the final by Jannik Sinner, later endured a tricky start to his Cincinnati campaign against world number 56 Damir Dzumhur.

The 22-year-old, who has reached the final at his last six tournaments, overcame a mid-match slump to beat his Bosnian opponent 6-1 2-6 6-3. He will face Serb Hamad Medjedovic next.

But there was a surprising early exit for 12th seed and 2019 champion Daniil Medvedev as he was beaten 6-7 (0-7) 6-4 6-1 by Australian world number 85 Adam Walton, who recorded his first win over a top-50 opponent.

Sixth seed Alex de Minaur also exited on Sunday, with the Australian losing 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 to American Reilly Opelka, the world number 73.

In Cincinnati's WTA draw, world number two Coco Gauff cruised past China's Wang Xinyu 6-3 6-2.

The American will next face Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska, who beat Viktoriya Tomova of Bulgaria 6-4 2-6 6-2.

American fourth seed Jessica Pegula beat Australia's Kimberly Birrell 6-4 6-3, while the seventh seed is also through, with Italy's Jasmine Paolini holding her nerve after two tight sets to beat Maria Sakkari of Greece 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-5).

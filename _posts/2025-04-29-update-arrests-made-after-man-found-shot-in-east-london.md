According to new developments, Two people have been arrested after a man was found with a gunshot wound at a residential property in east London.

The Metropolitan Police said officers were called at about 14:40 BST to Upton Lane, Forest Gate, following reports of gunshots.

Police were joined by the London Ambulance Service at the property, where the man was treated for a gunshot wound before being taken to a major trauma centre. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Two other people were taken to hospital with head injuries, and a firearm was recovered from the scene, the Met said.

Ch Insp Daryl Jones said: "We are aware that this shooting on a residential street this afternoon would have had an enormous impact on the local community.

"We are pleased we've been able to make two arrests and recover a firearm within hours of the incident.

"Any residents with concerns, please speak to the officers at the scene or to your local neighbourhood policing teams."

The force said a cordon remained in place in the area.

Let's dive into the details: The front pages of The Daily Mail, The Times and The Daily Telegraph all focus on social media messages sent by the British-Egyptian activist, Alaa Abdel Fattah, described by the government as "abhorrent". 

Writing in The Daily Mail, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, says she "does not want people who hate Britain coming to our country" and says the Home Office should consider deporting him. 

The Times quotes both a minister and a senior Labour MP calling for the activist to be stripped of his British citizenship, with the minister telling the paper serious questions need to be asked about the lack of judgement in allowing him into the UK. Alaa Abdel Fattah has apologised, but says the meaning of some of the posts has been "twisted".

President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky meeting in Florida to discuss a Ukraine peace deal features in most of the papers. The i Paper says there was an "upbeat" mood. But the Guardian reports that a former Ukrainian diplomat has accused President Putin of trying to "sabotage things" by speaking to Trump on the phone ahead of the talks in Mar-a-Lago.

And the face of Brigitte Bardot features on many of the front pages, after her death was announced yesterday. She was 91. The Daily Mail describes her as "France's most alluring export". "La Belle Bardot" is the headline in the Daily Mirror.

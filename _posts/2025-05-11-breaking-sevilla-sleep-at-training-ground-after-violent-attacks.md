It has been recently reported that Sevilla are winless in their last eight games

Sevilla's first team were forced to spend the night at their training facility on Saturday evening after they were met with "violent attacks" by supporters.

A statement released by the club strongly condemned "organised vandalism" at the Jose Ramon Cisneros Palacios training complex after Sevilla's 3-2 loss at 10-man Celta Vigo.

Footage on social media appears to show a large group of supporters chanting outside of the facility with pyrotechnics, while another shows them tearing down the gate to the entrance of the training ground.

Players and staff of the La Liga side were forced to stay inside the building following their arrival back from Vigo.

Sevilla added that the club "will pursue the public naming of employees and the dissemination of private data on social media and in the media, acts that constitute criminal offenses".

Defeat in Vigo left Sevilla 16th in La Liga, six points above the relegation zone with three games left to play.

The La Liga side, who won the Europa League in 2020 and 2023, said they will report the attacks and vandalism and will do "everything in its power to assist in the pursuit of the perpetrators of these crimes". 

The statement said the club "will try to help identify those involved in these actions and will act relentlessly in the event that they are Sevilla FC fans".

The club acknowledged their poor season on the field and accepted protests but "under no circumstances will they be tolerated if they are accompanied by aggression, threats, or acts of vandalism".

Winless in their last eight, Sevilla play relegation rivals Las Palmas on Tuesday in a huge game before hosting Real Madrid and rounding the season off with a trip to Villarreal.

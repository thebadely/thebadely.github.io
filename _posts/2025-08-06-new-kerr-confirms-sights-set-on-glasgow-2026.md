Experts revealed that Josh Kerr says racing for Team Scotland is a 'big deal'

Josh Kerr says he is planning for a "very special" Commonwealth Games after confirming he intends to race in Glasgow next summer.

The Olympic silver medalist and current world champion from Edinburgh revealed he is targeting the home event on the back of coasting to victory in the 5,000m at the UK Athletics Championships.

Last week marked the one year to go mark for the Games to return to Scotland, 11 years after the city last hosted the event.

"Of course the Commonwealths are in my plans and on my mind for next year," said Kerr.

"Racing for Team Scotland would be a big deal for me and I feel very lucky we have the Commonwealth Games again coming to the UK. It is going to be in Glasgow and that can be very special.

"It is a big part of my calendar for 2026 and I will look forward to that. The Europeans are in Birmingham a couple of weeks later."

The 28-year-old is currently preparing for his 1500m title defence at the World Championships in September.

And Kerr, who eased to victory over the weekend, says he is keen to give a better account of himself at next year's Games compared to Birmingham three years ago.

The Scot finished 12th in the 1500m, and said: "Last time around, here in Birmingham, it was not a fantastic experience or effort from me - there were lots of reasons for that in the summer of 2022.

"But my job is to perform consistently - and do that for everyone watching and for myself."

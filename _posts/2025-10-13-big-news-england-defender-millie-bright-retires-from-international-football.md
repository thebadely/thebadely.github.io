Let's dive into the details: Millie Bright captained England at the Women's World Cup in 2023

England defender Millie Bright has announced her retirement from international football.

The 32-year-old, who was part of England's European Championship-winning team in 2022, made her senior debut in September 2016 and went on to win 88 caps.

"I've been weighing this up for a long time," Chelsea captain Bright said on Monday's 'The Rest is Football: Daly Brightness' podcast.

"It's one of those decisions no-one can make for you. It's a feeling and I'm at peace with it."

Bright missed out as England defended their Euros title in Switzerland in July after ruling herself out of the tournament because she would be unable to "give 100% mentally or physically".

Over the summer she had successful knee surgery and started counselling sessions, while she said the decision to withdraw from Sarina Wiegman's squad was "by far the best decision I have ever made".

"Having the summer to reflect, fix my knee and get my head straight really put things into perspective. As you get older your priorities change. I've been craving family time, time with friends and time for myself," Bright said.

Bright started every game as England won their first major women's trophy at Euro 2022, and captained them to the World Cup final a year later, which they lost to Spain.

"I'm incredibly proud and honoured to have played for England for so long. Every single cap has been special and the memories I've made - especially with this one sat opposite me - have been some of the best of my life," Bright said on the podcast, which she co-hosts with her friend and former England team-mate Rachel Daly.

"But yeah, it's time. It's the right time for me to call it a day with England."

Bright's final game for the Lionesses was a 3-2 defeat by Belgium in April.

England manager Wiegman said: "Millie will forever be an England legend for what she has given to her country, and I could never have enough words to praise her impact during my time."

Wiegman is likely to be asked further questions about Bright's retirement on Tuesday after she names her first England squad since the Lionesses retained their title.

Bright, speaking in August, said missing the Euros was the 'best decision I ever made'

Before ruling herself out of Euro 2025, Bright's England future was uncertain when she withdrew from June's Nations League fixtures - just a month before Wiegman's side started their title defence.

The centre-back later cited burnout as the reason for her decision, after a season in which she made 36 appearances as Chelsea won the domestic treble of the Women's Super League (WSL), FA Cup and League Cup.

Chelsea said Bright had knee surgery the day after she made herself unavailable for the Euros.

"Physically I'm at that crossroads," Bright said on Monday's podcast.

"Can I be 50% for each - for England and for Chelsea? I want to be all in. To give myself the best chance of doing that and be the best for my club, I probably need to rein it in a little bit."

Because of her knee injury, Bright said she "had not given a single thought" about going to this year's Euros.

"I wasn't even thinking about football in the summer," she added. "I got surgery on my knee and that was honestly my priority. I just said 'listen, I can't' - I couldn't physically go."

In her 88 caps for England, Bright has showed her qualities as a "noânonsense" defender who was - and still is for Chelsea - powerful, and dominant in the air.

She first tasted major-tournament football 10 months after her debut at Euro 2017, where she was the only England player to start every match as they reached the semi-finals, falling to eventual winners the Netherlands.

Two years later, she was once again ever-present in England's backline as they reached the last four of the 2019 World Cup, but Bright's tournament was to end in heartbreak as she was sent off in the Lionesses' defeat by the United States.

She was named vice-captain to Leah Williamson for Euro 2022 on home soil, and it was only natural she took the captaincy when Williamson was ruled out of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand through injury the following year.

Bright played all seven games as England reached the final, where they lost to Spain - in what would be Bright's last appearance at a major tournament.

Wiegman added: "Whether she had the armband or not, she is a true leader. I know how much respect there is for Millie within the game - not just because she has won so many trophies but because of the way she conducts herself.

"She has made such a big contribution to English football both on and off the pitch and we all have a lot to thank her for. Even though her playing time with the Lionesses may be over, I know she has so much more to give the game."

Bright's retirement is a mark of the changing of the guard with competition flooding into the England squad.

At the age of 32, and having withdrawn from Euro 2025 selection, her decision does not come as a surprise, though it will be an emotional farewell to her England career.

Bright's longevity - an ever-present in a nine-year international career - is a testament to her professionalism and her ability to play at the highest level consistently.

She is still captaining ruthless WSL champions Chelsea and has started all their league games this season, but juggling international football and a gruelling domestic schedule has no doubt taken its toll on her.

Leah Williamson, Jess Carter, Esme Morgan and Alex Greenwood proved to be strong centre-back combinations at Euro 2025 in Bright's absence, and there are young players such as Manchester United's Maya le Tissier wanting to break into Wiegman's team.

With Bright's position in the side a growing doubt, it felt like the right time for her to step away from England duty and focus on domestic matters.

She will go down as one of England's most influential players in modern history, having played an instrumental role in their Euro 2022 success and run to the 2023 World Cup final.

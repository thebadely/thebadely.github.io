Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gabriel has been a goal threat since joining Arsenal, scoring 17 goals in 160 Premier League appearances

Arsenal are in advanced talks with defender Gabriel over a new contract.

The 27-year-old Brazil international's deal expires in 2027 but the Gunners have been in discussions over new terms.

It is understood those negotiations have accelerated with an agreement now close.

That is a major boost to the Gunners heading into a crucial close season, where the club are expected to make a number of key signings.

Gabriel has emerged as a key player under Mikel Arteta but his season was curtailed in April after suffering a hamstring injury that required surgery.

However, the centre-back is expected to be fit for the start of next season.

Gabriel scored five goals for the Gunners in all competitions during the season just completed.

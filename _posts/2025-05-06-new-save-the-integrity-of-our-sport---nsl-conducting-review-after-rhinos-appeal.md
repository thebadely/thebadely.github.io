Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leeds Rhinos lost in overtime against Birmingham Panthers

The Netball Super League (NSL) is "conducting a review" after Leeds Rhinos asked them to overturn Sunday's controversial defeat to Birmingham Panthers.

Panthers won 71-69 at Worcester Arena, but Rhinos believe they should have been given the victory in regulation time.

Joyce Mvula appeared to score a two-point super shot in the final minute of the game that would have put Leeds on level terms.

Rhinos then scored a one-pointer at the death, believing it meant they had won.

However, the visitors then discovered they had been credited with only one point for the earlier shot they were convinced was worth two.

Replays appeared to back up Rhinos' claims, with Mvula seeming to shoot from the two-point area in the shooting circle.

The super shot was introduced to the league this season, allowing shooters to score two-pointers from a marked-out area during the final five minutes of each quarter.

The one-point decision meant the game was tied at 59-59, to the dismay of Leeds players, who were visibly shocked and slipped to defeat in extra time.

Former England captain Geva Mentor, who plays for Leeds Rhinos, posted on X, external calling for the NSL to "save the integrity of our sport".

The NSL confirmed to BBC Sport on Tuesday that it was reviewing the incident, but how they might deal with the unusual case remains to be seen.

There is no video technology available to the match officials during games.

In a statement, Leeds said: "NIC Leeds Rhinos Netball have submitted an appeal to the Netball Super League competition committee to appeal the result of their round 8 fixture against Birmingham Panthers.

"The appeal is based on the circumstances in which the game ended in regular time.

"We are awaiting a response from the competition committee."

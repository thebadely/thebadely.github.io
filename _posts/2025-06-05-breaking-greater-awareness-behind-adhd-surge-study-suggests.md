According to new developments, ADHD is not becoming more common despite the surge in people asking for help, research suggests.

The review, led by King's College London, looked at 40 studies in 17 countries and found no clear evidence rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had risen since 2020, despite reported rises in diagnoses and longer waits for assessment.

Some blame greater social media use and the Covid pandemic for rising numbers  - but the researchers say greater awareness and acceptance were likely to be encouraging more people to seek help.

There were no signs the true rate of ADHD, known as prevalence, was on the up, they added.

Lead researcher Dr Alex Martin said it was likely to be a case of under-diagnosis of the condition in the first place.

"ADHD prevalence in adults and children has remained largely stable since 2020," she added.

In the UK, around 3 to 4% of adults and around 5% of children and young people are thought to have ADHD. Experts believe there are similar rates in other countries but only a fraction of these have been diagnosed.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by difficulties with concentration, energy levels, impulsiveness, or by a person's ability to manage their time.

The study, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, comes as a national taskforce in England is looking at what this rising demand for support means across the NHS, education and justice sectors.

Figures published last week by NHS England estimated there were nearly 2.5 million people in England with ADHD, with more than 550,000 currently waiting for an assessment. Every month 20,000 more people are referred for support, a 13% rise on this time last year.

NHS England has admitted patients are waiting "too long for assessment and diagnosis".

Patient watchdog Healthwatch England has also campaigned on the issue, calling for better support.

A report it published last week highlighted how ADHD can lead to people struggling in work and education and emphasised the importance of them getting a diagnosis to help understand and manage their condition.

One woman, Alex, told the watchdog a diagnosis had helped her find ways to manage better and opened up access to medication which meant she was better able to care for her daughter.

"I just couldn't cope with normal things or keep a routine. It made living exhausting."

But the 32-year-old was only able to get a diagnosis after paying for private support.

"I'm lucky I could afford going private, but I know many people can't," she added.

Henry Shelford, of ADHD UK, said the condition had been ignored for too long.

"Increasing  awareness and diagnosis is the key to unlocking the talents of over 2 million people in the UK. 

"Doing so isn't just good for the individual, it's economically positive for the entire country."

Prof Edmund Sonuga-Barke, a fellow at the Academy of Medical Sciences and an ADHD expert at King's College London who was not involved in the research, said it was clear there had been a "chronic under-diagnosis" of ADHD in the UK.

He said while ADHD medications were safe, there needed to be more progress in developing a greater range of non-drug treatments and therapies to help people self-manage their conditions.

It comes amid criticism too many people are being placed on drugs to treat ADHD.

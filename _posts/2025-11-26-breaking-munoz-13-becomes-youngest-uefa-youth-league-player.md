According to new developments, Luis Munoz turns 14 next month

Arsenal's 13-year-old midfielder Luis Munoz has become the youngest ever player to feature in the Uefa Youth League.

The England Under-15 international, born in December 2011, came off the bench in the 85th minute of Arsenal's 4-2 win over Bayern Munich in the under-19s competition - in a game that was also notable because of two goals from Gunners wonderkid Max Dowman.

At 13 years 11 months and 15 days, Munoz breaks the record held by Liam Payas - who played for Gibraltar-based Lincoln Red Imps aged 14 years three months and one day in September last year.

Munoz, who turns 14 next month, plays as a midfielder but came on as a forward for the last few minutes of the match. 

Earlier this month, Munoz was part of the Arsenal Under-16 squad that won the Premier League U16 National Finals, beating Aston Villa in the final.

Dowman, 15, who made his Premier League debut in August, was 14 years eight months and 19 days old when he played in the Uefa Youth League for the first time.

The competition is for the under-19s teams of the clubs competing in the Champions League.

Emerson Nwaneri, 15 and brother of first-team midfielder Ethan, also came off the bench in the victory.

The Gunners are unlikely to progress to the knockout stages, after four losses in their opening five games, and their squad for the match against Bayern featured a number of less experienced youngsters to give them exposure to the competition.

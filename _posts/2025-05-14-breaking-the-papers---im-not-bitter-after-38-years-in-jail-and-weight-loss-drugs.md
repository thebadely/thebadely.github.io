It has been recently reported that With the headline, "cleared after 38 years", The Daily Mirror is one of several papers to highlight the case of Peter Sullivan, after his conviction for the murder of Diane Sindall in 1986 was dramatically quashed yesterday. 

The Sun describes the 68-year-old as "the victim of Britain's longest-running miscarriage of justice", and says he was "seen sobbing" on a video link from jail as he learned he would be freed on DNA evidence. 

The Daily Mail focuses on what it calls Mr Sullivan's "extraordinary reaction" to his release, noting he said was "not angry" and "not bitter", but "simply anxious" to make the most of the rest of his life.

The Daily Telegraph says counter-terrorism police, investigating the arson attacks on properties and a car linked to Sir Keir Starmer, are considering the possibility that a hostile state may be involved. 

The paper suggests the targets have "raised suspicions" there was a "significant degree of planning". 

It says the head of Counter Terrorism Command has issued a "rare" statement, urging any MPs who may be concerned to contact police.

Research suggesting that weight-loss drugs can delay diseases associated with aging and halve deaths from heart attacks is featured by The Times, which says the jabs are being hailed as ushering in a "golden age" of medicine. 

Ministers are reported to be examining ways to "rapidly increase" the availability of drugs including Wegovy, after a series of breakthroughs were presented at the European Congress of Obesity in Malaga.

The Guardian looks ahead to possible peace talks between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia tomorrow, after the Kremlin called for direct negotiations in Turkey. 

President Zelensky has told the paper that he'll travel to the country, despite uncertainty over whether President Putin will turn up, in the hope that a potential appearance by President Trump will push his Russian counterpart to attend.

The Financial Times suggests that efforts by the government to rebuild relations with China could be "hurt" by Beijing's criticism of the tariff deal struck between the UK and US last week. 

It says China has warned that the agreement should not be used to squeeze its products out of British supply chains.

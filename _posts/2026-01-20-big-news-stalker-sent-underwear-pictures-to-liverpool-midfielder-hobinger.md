According to new developments, A father-of-two has been handed a two-year restraining order and an 18-month community order for stalking Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger.

The Austria international was distressed and said her performance on the pitch was affected after Mangal Dalal, 42, sent her pictures of underwear and said he wanted to rip her shorts off in messages on Instagram, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

She had to change her daily actions, held back from mixing with fans on matchdays and felt anxious in her own home, the court was told.

Dalal, of Marylebone, west London, was also ordered to pay £650 costs and a £114 victim surcharge.

He had pleaded guilty to stalking at Liverpool Magistrates' Court in December.

Passing sentence, Judge Hina Rai told him: "The nature and tone of the highly sexualised content was distressing and caused her to be fearful of her surroundings and affected her daily life."

Prosecutor David Burns told the court Dalal also sent explicit messages and told Hobinger he wanted to have babies with her.

The stress of the situation led to a flare-up of a skin condition she had suffered, the court heard.

In her victim impact statement, she said: "This incident has meant I now struggle to sleep.

At home, she said she becomes " anxious and scared - any noise, I fear the male may have found out where I lived.

"When it is dark I found myself looking over my shoulder. I know I was safe, but felt anxiety and rushed inside.

"It is not a nice feeling especially when your home is meant to be a safe place."

Hobinger also said the events had "affected my performance on the pitch".

Speaking about when fans take pictures, she said she would "often shy away as I feel insecure" and she does not want to be with them.

She added: "I love matchdays and this is a time when I should feel focused and strong.

"Although I am in the public eye I do not feel it is acceptable to receive sexually explicit messages.

"I do not feel that it is acceptable women's football is sexualised and disrespected.

"No woman, no matter what her job, should have to put up with this kind of behaviour."

There is no automatic right to anonymity for the victim in this type of offending.

It is believed Hobinger was named because her prominent role in professional football was a major reason as to why she was targeted.

Sources at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) say they hope raising awareness of the offence will act as a deterrent to others and give victims courage to come forward.

Hobinger described her club as "amazing" in supporting her in the face of the Dalal's unwanted attentions.

He included his mobile number and postcode in the sexually explicit messages, which were posted between 27 January and 16 February 2025, the court heard.

He also asked her to visit him.

Worries over the Austrian's safety rose so much the club's safety officer travelled with her to matches.

Dalal travelled to an away game in Manchester last February, and was spotted by the pitch at the end of the game.

He later admitted this in a police interview but said he had been mentally unwell.

Defending, Daniel Lister said Dalal was of previous good character and worked in investments.

He said his client had been suffering from a psychotic episode due to a diagnosed condition at the time he was contacting Hobinger.

He was "in the midst of a health crisis" and was seen barefoot, preaching sermons in the street, prompting his ex-wife to try to call for medical help.

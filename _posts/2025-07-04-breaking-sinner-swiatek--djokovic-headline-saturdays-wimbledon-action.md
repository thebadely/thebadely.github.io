It has been recently reported that Novak Djokovic beat Great Britain's Dan Evans in straight sets on Thursday to secure his spot in round three

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Men's world number one Jannik Sinner, seven-time champion Novak Djokovic and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek are among the headline acts on the first Saturday of Wimbledon fortnight.

Sinner has demonstrated why he is one of the big favourites for a first title at SW19 by cruising through his first two matches, while Djokovic showed glimpses of his best form in his second-round victory over Great Britain's Dan Evans.

Meanwhile, eighth seed Swiatek is one of the highest remaining seeds in the women's draw and the Pole will hope to get into round four at Wimbledon for only the third time in her career.

Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova, 2022 winner Elena Rybakina and highly-rated teenager Mirra Andreeva will also be looking to secure their passages through to the last 16.

Italian Sinner has reached the finals of the past three Grand Slam events, winning two of them. At 13:30 BST, he will open play on Centre Court against Spaniard Pedro Martinez, who is ranked 52nd in the world.

Djokovic, 38, is making his 20th appearance in the men's singles at Wimbledon and will aim to make it to the fourth round for the 17th time. 

He is third on Centre against fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, who has equalled his best-ever run at the tournament.

In between those two matches, world number four Swiatek takes on former Australian Open runner-up Danielle Collins.

Seventh seed Andreeva plays in the first match on Court One (13:00 BST) against Wimbledon debutant Hailey Baptiste, followed by Krejcikova's tie against 10th seed Emma Navarro of the United States.

Men's 10th seed Ben Shelton, having needed just over a minute to wrap up his second-round win on Friday, rounds things off on Court One against Hungarian qualifier Marton Fucsovics.

There are no British players in singles action on Saturday, but the three doubles events contain home interest and the juniors' tournaments also get under way.

Fifth seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool are in show court action as they take on Hendrik Jebens and Albano Olivetti last on court two in the second round of the men's doubles.

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski - the sixth seeds - also continue their quest for the men's doubles title when they take to court 15 for their second-round match against Nicolas Barrientos and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli.

Salisbury returns to the same court later as he partners Luisa Stefan of Brazil in the mixed doubles.

It might be a day off from the singles for home hope Sonay Kartal, but she is back in action alongside Jodie Burrage as they face 11th seeds Beatriz Haddad Maia and Laura Siegemund in the women's doubles second-round on court 16.

Also in the women's doubles, Ella McDonald and Mimi Xu take on American pairing and 16th seeds Caroline Dolehide and Sofia Kenin third on court three.

There are two notable names in girls' singles first-round action, with second seed Hannah Klugman and seventh seed Mika Stojsavljevic - who both made their debuts in the women's draw this year - get their junior competitions under way later on court 12.

Kazakhstan's Rybakina, one of the most impressive performers during the first week, will be among those first in action when play on the outside courts begins at 11:00 BST.

She is up against Denmark's 23rd seed Clara Tauson, while former Eastbourne champion Daria Kasatkina, now representing Australia, is first on court three against Russian Liudmila Samsonova.

In the men's draw, Alex de Minaur could meet Djokovic in round four if he gets past Danish qualifier August Holmgren, while Grigor Dimitrov may meet Sinner in the last 16 should he defeat Austria's Sebastian Ofner.

Veteran Croat Marin Cilic, who knocked out British number one Jack Draper in round two, in second on court 18 against unseeded Spaniard Jaume Munar.

Experts revealed that Deputy Jayne Ozanne is to resign from the Committee for Education, Sport and Culture (ESC). 

In an e-mail to States members, the Guernsey politician she said she was stepping down "for personal reasons".

She will remain Vice-president of the Committee for Employment and Social Security and a member of the Transport Licensing Authority. 

Deputy Haley Camp has expressed an interest in the vacancy, with an election expected to take place on 26 November. 

If Camp is elected, she will have to resign from the Education Devolution & Delegation Investigation & Advisory Committee. 

Following the announcement of her intention to resign from ESC, Ozanne said she had had "a very difficult few months".

She added: "I also want to use time to look at new ways of how I can really help islanders who are struggling with the cost of living crisis, and I'm keen to be working across committees to look at potential requetes as a way that we can actually make things really work for Islanders who are hurting."

Ozanne praised the leadership of ESC President Paul Montague and said it had been "a real privilege and joy to work" with her colleagues on the committee.

Any potential replacements for Ozanne on ESC will need a proposer and a seconder from the floor and, if there is an election, they will face questions from their colleagues about ESC's mandate.

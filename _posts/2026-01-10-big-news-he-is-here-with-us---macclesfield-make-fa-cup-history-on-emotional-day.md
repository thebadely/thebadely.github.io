Paul Dawson scored the opening goal for Macclesfield against Crystal Palace - watch highlights (UK only)

When the final whistle blew to confirm non-league Macclesfield's stunning FA Cup upset of holders Crystal Palace, it prompted memorable scenes. Fans poured on to the pitch and lifted captain Paul Dawson into the air.

With his head bandaged after a clash early in a remarkable 2-1 win, Dawson embodied the spirit and character of the whole team as they made light of being ranked five divisions and 117 places below their Premier League opponents.

In terms of the difference in league places, it was the greatest shock in the prestigious competition's long history. The gap was not evident on the pitch - Macclesfield fully deserved the result.

It was a win earned against a backdrop of tragedy.

Macclesfield forward Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident last month, was remembered at Moss Rose 

On 16 December, Silkmen forward Ethan McLeod died in a car accident while travelling back from their National League North match at Bedford Town.

He was in the thoughts of all those connected to Macclesfield throughout their memorable day on Saturday.

A picture of him hung between the dugouts while there was a banner paying tribute in the stands at Moss Rose. The 21-year-old's parents were at the game.

"I just walked in the office then and his parents are in the office celebrating with us," Macclesfield boss John Rooney said afterwards.

"I said to his parents: He is definitely watching down on us today. I feel he is here with us.

"To have his mum and dad here - to come into the changing room, to come into the office. That means so much to me."

Macclesfield stun FA Cup holders Crystal Palace

It isn't that long since Crystal Palace were celebrating an FA Cup upset of their own, beating Manchester City at Wembley last May to win the trophy for the first time.

But whereas Macclesfield's players played with passion and pride, Palace were well out of sorts. This was their ninth consecutive game without a win in all competitions.

Victory made Macclesfield the first non-league team to eliminate the FA Cup holders since Crystal Palace knocked out Wolves in the 1908-09 first round.

The Silkmen also became the first non-league team to score twice in an FA Cup match against a Premier League team since Kettering Town versus Fulham in 2009, and the first against the holders since Runcorn against Preston in 1939.

"The boys were outstanding. I couldn't be any prouder," Rooney, brother of former England and Manchester United striker Wayne, added.

"That has got to be the biggest upset. I cannot get my head around it. I thought we deserved to win the game.

"They won their individual duels, the way we defended our box. I thought we carried what we told them in the dressing room before the game."

Are FA Cup upsets still 'magic'?

Many will feel Macclesfield fans deserved this moment after the difficulties they have endured in recent years.

In 2020, Macclesfield Town ceased trading, consigning 146 years of football to the history books.

Local businessman Robert Smethurst bought the club's assets and, with former Wales midfielder Robbie Savage joining the board, they were reformed as a phoenix club.

After joining the ninth-tier North West Counties Premier Division, three promotions in four seasons have lifted them to the sixth tier, where they are just a handful of points outside the play-off places despite being in the bottom half of the table.

With Savage having left to join Forest Green Rovers, John Rooney took charge and he has fashioned a side who play with confidence and purpose, no matter who they face.

That image of bandaged captain Dawson celebrating with the fans will likely become iconic, certainly among the club's supporters when they reflect upon a day that will live long in the memory.

"That shows what he is about," Rooney said of Dawson. 

"He'll take cuts, he'll take bruises. He's a warrior. He pops up with goals, as well. He is not the biggest profile, but he is fantastic in the air."

Rooney's brother Wayne, covering the match for BBC Sport, was full of pride.

"It's incredible to see my younger brother achieve this," he said. 

"He has not long been the manager. I am so proud of him."

Fans raced on to the pitch at full time to celebrate Macclesfield's win

The FA Cup is renowned for delivering shocks and memorable moments and this result will rank among the best.

"We have just witnessed one of the greatest moments in FA Cup history," former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock said. 

"They showed quality. What a day for Macclesfield and what a day for those players."

Former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson added: "The greatest cup competition in the world provides another piece of incredible history in front of our eyes. 

"Macclesfield fans young and old have been waiting years for this. Every single one of these players put in a special performance today.

"You cannot underplay the enormity of this giant-killing."

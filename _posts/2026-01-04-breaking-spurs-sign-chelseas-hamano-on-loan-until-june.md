Let's dive into the details: Maika Hamano is considered an exciting young talent in Japan

Tottenham have completed the signing of Chelsea's Maika Hamano on loan until the end of the season.

The 21-year-old Japan international is seeking regular game time having shown her potential at Chelsea since joining in 2023. 

Hamano can play in a number of positions in midfield and attack but is largely used as a winger by Japan.

She has made 45 appearances in total for Chelsea, including seven this season, and was part of the Japan squad at the 2023 Women's World Cup.

"Watching the team this season, I really felt they've been playing some great football and I thought I could develop a lot as a player," said Hamano.

"I want to show fans the connection with my team-mates. At the end of the day, football is about winning and I'll do my best to contribute to the team's success."

It has been a busy start to the transfer window for Tottenham with Hamano joining January recruits Matilda Nilden, Hanna Wijk and Signe Gaupset.

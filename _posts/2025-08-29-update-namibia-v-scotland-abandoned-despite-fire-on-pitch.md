Experts revealed that Groundstaff in King City in Ontario set a damp patch on fire in an attempt to play the game

Cricket World Cup League 2, Namibia v Scotland

Match abandoned without a ball bowled

Scotland's one-day international against Namibia was abandoned without a ball being bowled, despite some unusual techniques from the local groundstaff.

The toss in King City in Ontario, Canada, was delayed because of rain and although one particular damp patch was deliberately set on fire, the match was called off after multiple pitch inspections.

Scotland face hosts Canada on Monday before another fixture against Namibia on 4 September.

This leg of Cricket World Cup League 2 began on Wednesday as Namibia beat Canada by five wickets.

The Scots stay third in the overall standings with 11 wins from their 21 matches, behind the USA and the Netherlands, while Canada and Namibia are fifth and sixth, respectively.

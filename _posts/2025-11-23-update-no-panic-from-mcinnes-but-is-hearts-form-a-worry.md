Let's dive into the details: Aberdeen v Hearts highlights

23/11/25

Hearts have taken the Scottish Premiership by storm this season, winning nine of their opening 12 league matches and remaining unbeaten until Sunday's 1-0 reverse at Aberdeen.

They are still four points ahead of nearest rivals Celtic, having played a game more, but have dropped points in three of their past four matches.

To add to the gathering sense of foreboding, they are nervously waiting for the results of a scan on Lawrence Shankland's calf after their leading scorer missed the defeat at Pittodrie.

Parallels have been drawn between Hearts' impressive start and the way Aberdeen began last season - winning 10 of their first 11 and keeping pace with Celtic before then going 14 straight matches without a win.

Jimmy Thelin's side ultimately finished fifth in the Premiership, but did beat Celtic at Hampden to claim the Scottish Cup.

Head coach Derek McInnes refused to panic after Hearts' loss on Sunday, but does their recent stumble provide some cause for concern?

On the evidence on Sunday's performance, not really.

Hearts had the better of a game played in horrible weather, squandering several chances both before and after half-time.

Frankie Kent headed straight at the keeper from a few yards out, Harry Milne hit the crossbar from close range, Tomas Magnusson placed a header straight at Dimitar Mitov, and Claudio Braga was denied when he looked certain to score.

"Hearts only have themselves to blame for not coming away with three points," former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart said. "They had enough opportunities."

When Aberdeen got their one real sight of goal, they made it count. Kent failed to clear and Topi Keskinen took full advantage, finding the bottom corner.

"I thought we were the better team, created the better chances," McInnes said. "But we don't show the poise or quality for the final bit. We looked rushed at times.

"If we'd scored, it makes it a totally different environment for Aberdeen.

"We thought we'd done enough today not to lose. I was actually quite encouraged by the performance today without Lawrence and Craig Halkett.

"When you lose a game of football, you need to respond and I've no doubts we will respond."

'No doubts we will respond' - McInnes

Hearts have been outperforming their expected goals this season, scoring 29 times compared to an xG tally of 22.46, so the more legitimate concern could be that their high return doesn't last, especially if Shankland is out for a sustained period.

Pierre Landry Kabore partnered Braga on Sunday and had his moments in only his fifth appearance for the club, but blazed his best sight of goal high and wide.

Despite the loss, former Scotland striker Kris Boyd saw no reason for alarm.

"One win in four, it's a slight concern," he said on Sky Sports. "I don't think Hearts had a bad player on the pitch. I thought they defended reasonably well, they just lacked that cutting edge. It just wasn't to be in front of goal."

McInnes' side now go to Motherwell on Saturday, before a testing run of December matches against Kilmarnock, Celtic, Falkirk, Rangers and city rivals Hibernian.

"I don't think it's a daunting run at all," McInnes said. "We've got exciting games and games we can go and win. 

"We'll be bouncing into our work and getting ready to go again. 

"We know who we play for, we're enjoying being top of the league. We're enjoying winning games more than we're not and it's important we get back to that feeling."

Stand-in captain Cammy Devlin echoed the thoughts of his manager.

"The best thing is we only have to wait six days for our next game," he said. "It is about not feeling sorry for ourselves - we were going to lose a game. 

"Just get back to training, work as hard as we can and turn today's feeling into smiles and getting that winning feeling back again."

Paul: Hearts' bubble has well and truly burst.

Alasdair: That Callum McGregor goal for Celtic last night felt like a potential pivotal moment for the season. This result today seems to confirm it.

Colin: Celtic back on top for Christmas.

Jimmy: Hearts will be third by Christmas and won't finish higher than fourth.

Peter: Hearts are just as vulnerable as any other team. This result will have a massive impact on them. There will be a whole different dynamic in their team bus going home with no points. They have also been on the right side of some very controversial VAR decisions.

Alan: A defeat was going to come at some stage.  Disappointed but it's all about how we react now. Bounce back stronger and win the next one.

Ruddiger: The only bubble burst is the one other folk blew up in our name. 30 points from 39 is not something to be upset about.

Steven: Does/did anyone seriously believe Hearts were/are title contenders? As Rangers managers from Michael Beale to Philippe Clement have found out, talking a great game always ends with the same outcome - Celtic winning the league. It's not easy. I will hold my hands up if I'm wrong but McInnes doesn't win trophies and Bloom - no doubt talented - has just put a lot of unnecessary pressure on him.

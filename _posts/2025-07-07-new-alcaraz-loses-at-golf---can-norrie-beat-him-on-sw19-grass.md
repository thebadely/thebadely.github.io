It has been recently reported that Cameron Norrie faces Carlos Alcaraz in Tuesday's second match on Centre Court

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

As he prepares to face Cameron Norrie in the Wimbledon quarter-finals, Carlos Alcaraz does have one losing record against a British player this fortnight.

The Spanish superstar might have been unbeatable on the tennis court - having won the Queen's title before moving confidently into the SW19 last eight - but Sir Andy Murray has been quick to reveal Alcaraz is not as dominant on the golf course.

The pair have been playing together over the past 10 days, with the recently-retired Scot edging a best-of-three contest.

"It's true he beat me. But golf is a sport that is really helpful for me to switch off my mind," Alcaraz said.

"I'm trying to play as much golf as I can on my days off."

On Tuesday, Norrie - a decent golfer himself with a handicap of 13 - is aiming for more British success against two-time defending Wimbledon champion Alcaraz on Tuesday.

"I'm going to have to play my best to have a chance with him," British number three Norrie, who reached the semi-finals in 2022, told BBC Sport.

"[Grass] is probably his best surface. He's untouchable at the moment."

Alcaraz admits defeat in Andy Murray golf decider

Beating 22-year-old Alcaraz is one of the most difficult tasks in the sport right now.

The five-time major champion is on a 22-match winning streak, having claimed the Rome and French Open titles on the clay before heading to Ibiza for a now traditional pre-Wimbledon break.

Norrie, 29, decided to try the same strategy, spending time in Pacha nightclub as well as playing golf and chilling on the beach.

"I was telling my team, let's see if the Carlos method can work because he went to Ibiza and he won Wimby," he told British newspapers., external

"Tennis is super important, but I think it's important to enjoy off the court in your own way. 

"When you come to the court fresh, and you've had a few days on the beach or a few days in the sun relaxing, you feel ready to compete again."

Alcaraz, who has won his past 16 grass-court matches, is the perfect example.

Taking the time to recharge on the Balearic party island - like he did before each of his Wimbledon titles - is again paying off.

But Norrie, who is ranked 61st in the world, is planning to end Alcaraz's hopes of becoming only the fifth man to win three consecutive SW19 titles in the Open era.

The left-hander has beaten Alcaraz in two of their past three matches - in Cincinnati and Rio de Janeiro - but this will be their first meeting on grass.

"I've played many times against him really tough and great battles, so I'm just really excited," said Alcaraz, who has already beaten one home player at Wimbledon in qualifier Ollie Tarvet.

"I know he's playing great tennis. He feels really comfortable on grass. 

"He's going to use the crowd and have the people on his side. I have got to be really focused and not thinking about the support."

By edging past huge-serving Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in the fourth round, Norrie became only the fourth British man in the Open era to reach multiple Wimbledon quarter-finals.  

Norrie's journey began in Johannesburg and, after moving to Auckland as a child and then studying at Texas Christian University in the United States, made a home in London.

With a Welsh mother and a Scottish father, he was always destined to represent the nation despite retaining a hint of a Kiwi accent.

His parents, microbiologists David and Helen, have been a driving force in his life and are proudly sharing more of his finest moments at the All England Club.

Along with his long-term partner Louise, they were among the 12,500 fans who cheered Norrie to a gutsy victory over Jarry.

Norrie could not convert a match point in the third set but completed victory two hours later in a decider - making him the final Briton left in the singles.

"I would have liked to have seen some more guys go deeper," said Norrie, who will be playing his first match on Centre Court this year when he takes on Alcaraz.

"But I'm not caring too much if I'm the last Brit standing or if they're all here. 

"I'm just taking care of my business and really enjoying my tennis at the moment."

Norrie has endured a difficult time over the past couple of seasons, with a forearm injury last year contributing to his ranking plummeting towards the bottom of the top 100.

But he has rediscovered his form over the past couple of months. He reached the French Open fourth round last month before forging another deep run at a Grand Slam.

"It is nice to be back and nice to enjoy the tennis, enjoy the moments," he said.

"Carlos is confident and he's smiling. I'm going to have to enjoy my tennis as much as him and and execute everything to have a chance."

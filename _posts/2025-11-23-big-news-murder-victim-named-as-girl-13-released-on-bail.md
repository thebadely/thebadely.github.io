According to new developments, A woman who died inside her home has been named by police after a 13-year-old girl arrested on suspicion of her murder was released on bail.

The woman who died in Swindon on Friday was 55-year-old Sarah Forrester, Wiltshire Police have confirmed.

They said she had not been breathing when officers arrived at her house in Baydon Close, Moredon, at about 19:00 GMT after being called to a disorder. She died at the scene.

The 13-year-old girl was later arrested on suspicion of murder and taken into custody for questioning. She has since been bailed while enquiries continue.

Ms Forrester worked as a counsellor at The Kelly Foundation, a Swindon charity which supports individuals with severe anxiety, depression and other mental health issues.

The foundation was set up in memory of Kelly Jobanputra, a BBC Radio 6 Music producer and former BBC Radio Wiltshire presenter who took her own life in 2019.

In a statement, The Kelly Foundation said it was "heartbroken at the sudden loss of our lovely Sarah".

"She was completely committed to the charity and devoted to her two young children," the statement continued.

"Sarah was pivotal in the work that we do here at The Kelly Foundation and her loss is a hugely traumatic event, not just for us and her colleagues but more especially for her children and family.

"Sarah was an incredible person, kind, thoughtful, considerate, caring and funny and she embodied everything that we hope our charity is and can be.

"She enjoyed her role with us and we all loved working with her, she will be truly, truly missed."

Ch Supt Guy Elkins, from Wiltshire Police, said: "Our thoughts are with Sarah's friends and family at this awful time.

"An investigation into her death is being led by our major crime investigation team and local residents will continue to see increased policing activity in the area."

He said police are not looking for anyone else in connection with Ms Forrester's death.

"We continue to urge people not to speculate on the incident," he added.

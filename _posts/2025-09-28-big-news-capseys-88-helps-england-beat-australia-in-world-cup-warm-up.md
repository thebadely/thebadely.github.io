Let's dive into the details: Alice Capsey helped England recover from 32-3 

Women's World Cup warm-up, Bengaluru 

Australia 247 (34.4 overs): Litchfield 71 (48); Glenn 5-32

England 251-6 (44.3 overs): Capsey 88* (85); Garth 2-17

England won by four wickets 

Alice Capsey struck an unbeaten 88 as England beat Australia by four wickets in their final Women's World Cup warm-up match in India.

England slipped to 32-3 in pursuit of 248 to win in Bengaluru before Capsey revived the innings in a stand of 82 with Sophia Dunkley, who made 54. 

Dunkley was caught behind off Darcie Brown and Danni Wyatt-Hodge fell cheaply for 10, but Capsey held firm and a partnership of 109 with Emma Lamb put England within touching distance. 

The in-form Lamb, who made 81 against India in the other warm-up fixture, fell for 60 with just four more runs required but Capsey's knock ensured that England reached their target comfortably in the 45th over.

It was an impressive recovery from a middle order without Nat Sciver-Brunt as England rotated the squad, and after the experienced top three of Tammy Beaumont, Amy Jones and Heather Knight fell cheaply. 

Beaumont and Knight were lbw to Kim Garth for eight and five respectively, while Jones fell to Megan Schutt for 11. 

England also produced an impressive fightback with the ball, as leg-spinner Sarah Glenn took 5-32, to bowl Australia out for 247 in 34.4 overs. 

Lauren Bell removed Australia captain Alyssa Healy in the first over but fellow opener Phoebe Litchfield top-scored with 71 from 48 balls as they reached 128-3 in the 16th over to set a strong platform. 

Australia also rotated their batting line-up, with Ellyse Perry not featuring, and crumbled as Glenn's bowling prompted a collapse to 167-8. 

Top-order batter Beth Mooney came in at number nine and made 59 from 42 balls after the rejigged middle order of Georgia Voll, Sophie Molineux and Georgia Wareham all fell for single-figure scores.

The World Cup begins on Tuesday with India taking on Sri Lanka in Guwahati, while England start their campaign against South Africa at the same venue on Friday.

It has been recently reported that Marius Lindvik (left) and Johann Andre Forfang have represented Norway in individual and team events

Two Norwegian ski jumpers and three team officials have been charged following allegations of tampering with ski suits, the sport's governing body has announced.

Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang have been charged with equipment manipulation in the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.

Then head coach Magnus Brevik, assistant coach Thomas Lobben and service staff member Adrian Livelten have also been charged following an International Ski Federation (FIS) investigation.

Speaking at the time, FIS general manager Jan-Erik Aalbu said the team had "tried to cheat the system" by putting reinforced thread in the jumpsuits of Lindvik and Forfang.

Lindvik, 27, had originally finished second in the men's large hill event while 30-year-old compatriot Forfang came fourth, but both were disqualified after an equipment inspection.

The duo, plus Brevik, Lobben and Livelten were all provisionally suspended in March pending an investigation.

The FIS has not said when its ethics committee would issue a ruling, with the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina starting in February.

Speaking on Monday, Aalbu said Lindvik and Forfang were unaware of the reinforced thread and questioned the decision to charge them.

"We have listened to our athletes and believe them when they say they did not know about the manipulation of the ski suits," Aalbu said.

"There is no evidence that they were aware of the manipulation that took place. We therefore disagree with FIS's assessment that there are grounds to bring a case against Forfang and Lindvik, but we respect the process."

Lindvik won gold in the men's large hill individual at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, while Forfang claimed a silver medal at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang in the normal hill individual.

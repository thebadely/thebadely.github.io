Experts revealed that Israel struck dozens of targets, including nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, across Iran on Friday, killing a number of senior military commanders in what it called "Operation Rising Lion".

The Israeli attacks also targeted a number of other influential figures linked to Iran's nuclear programmes, including six nuclear scientists, IRGC-affiliated news agency Tasnim reported.

Dozens of civilians, including children, have also been reported killed.

Here's what we know so far about the high-profile individuals among the dead.

Bagheri was the highest ranking military officer in Iran, being the chief of staff of Iran's armed forces - which includes both the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and the Iranian army.

Bagheri joined the IRGC in 1980 aged 20 and, alongside his brother, helped establish the IRGC's intelligence unit during the Iran-Iraq war.

He was considered less hardline than other commanders. He had come under criticism recently for a speech he made in April in front of the ancient ruins of Persepolis in which he called for peace and urged for the avoidance of war.

Abdolrahim Mousavi has been appointed the new chief of staff of the armed forces, Iranian state news agency Irna said. He does not come from within the ranks of the IRGC, being an army general.

Hossein Salami was the commander-in-chief of the IRGC.

Salami joined the IRGC in 1980 during the Iran-Iraq war, and went on to become a deputy commander in 2009, before progressing to commander in 2019.

Known for his ability as an orator, he took a hard-line stance towards Israel and as recently as last month said Tehran would "open the gates of hell" if attacked by either Israel or the US.

Mohammad Pakpour has been appointed as the new commander of the IRGC, Iranian state media report.

Gholamali Rashid was the head of the IRGC's Khatam-al Anbiya Central Headquarters, which coordinates joint Iranian military operations.

Rashid fought in the 1980s war with Iraq and was formerly the deputy chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces.

Since Rashid's death, Ali Shadmani has been appointed the emergency command's new leader, according to Iranian state media.

The commander of the IRGC's Aerospace Force, Hajizadeh was a prominent figure in charge of the country's missiles programme.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Hajizadeh had gathered in an underground command centre along with the majority of the IRGC's air force commanders to prepare for an attack on Israel.

The IDF said the group was then killed in a strike targeting the building.

It said Hajizadeh commanded Iran's missile attacks on Israel in October and April last year.

Hajizadeh was regarded less favourably by members of Iran's general public after he took responsibility for downing a Ukrainian passenger plane flying out of Tehran in 2020, which killed all 176 people on board.

Abbasi, a nuclear scientist, served as the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation between 2011 and 2013. 

He went on to be a member of parliament from 2020 to 2024.

He promoted hardline positions to do with Iran's nuclear activities.

In May, he spoke on Iranian TV channel SNN.ir about potentially building a nuclear weapon, and said he would willingly carry out orders to do so if he received them.

A number of other nuclear scientists are also reported by Iranian state media to have been killed.

They are:

According to new developments, The front pages of the Guardian and the Daily Mirror focus on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's messages for 2026 as the UK wakes up to a new year. 

According to the Daily Mail, "secret meetings" have taken place in which ministers have raised the prospect of newborn babies being allocated a digital ID. The Mail describes the possible plan as a "major expansion" of the scheme announced by the prime minister in September to try to curb illegal immigration.

The Daily Telegraph leads on the home secretary's vow to fight European judges over a fresh attempt by the IS bride, Shamima Begum, to return to the UK. The European Court of Human Rights has asked Britain to justify its decision to strip Ms Begum of her citizenship after she ran off to join the Islamic State group in Syria. A government source quoted by the Telegraph says the ruling has been "upheld time and again" in domestic courts.

There's a plea from the assisted dying campaigner, Dame Esther Rantzen, in the Daily Express. She is reportedly urging members of the public to write to peers who are opposed to the assisted dying bill in England and Wales. Dame Esther says members of the House of Lords must be reminded of the "pain and suffering" dying people will endure if the landmark legislation fails.

The Guardian reports that the Prime Minister will give a speech in the coming days focusing on how the government is bringing down living costs. "2026 will be better", is Sir Keir's message in the Daily Mirror. Writing in the paper, he says the next 12 months will see "hope" rediscovered adding people can "look forward with confidence".

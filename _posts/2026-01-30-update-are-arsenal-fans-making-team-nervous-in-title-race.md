Let's dive into the details: Arsenal are seeking their first top-flight title since 2004

Arsenal are in control of the Premier League title race, but are the nerves starting to show as the pressure mounts?

The Gunners are having an excellent season - four points clear in top spot, into the Champions League last 16 after winning all eight group-phase games, have a first-leg lead over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final and are into the FA Cup fourth round.

But there were boos after a first home loss of the season by Manchester United last weekend, amid a nervousness from their fanbase about missing out on a possible championship again after three successive second-placed finishes.

Boss Mikel Arteta gave a speech in his news conference before the midweek match against Kairat Almaty to urge supporters to "jump on the boat" with the team as they try to "enjoy" the title run-in.

And he was again on the front foot before Saturday's trip to Leeds, with the Gunners looking for their first win in four league matches.

"It's just understanding where you are," said Arteta. "Certainly, when you lose a game you have a lot of feelings.

"This group of players are so competitive and they seek excellence and when you don't reach it you ask yourself questions. My role there is to bring optimism and a reality of where we are.

"We are doing so many things so well and let's focus mainly on that. For sure we want to improve and be better in every area, but with that sense as well of self-confidence and conviction that we are on the right path."

But is the anxiety among supporters translating itself to the players? And what impact might that have?

Viktor Gyokeres has scored 10 goals in all competitions for Arsenal

One of the things about Arteta's Arsenal side which has been criticised is the Gunners do not have a clear goalscorer in the Premier League.

They signed Viktor Gyokeres in a summer deal worth Â£64m, but things have not clicked for the striker and he has just five league goals this season.

But the Gunners still have a hugely impressive record with the forward in the team, despite his issues in front of goal, and it is not only the Swedish international who has struggled to find the net.

None of the Arsenal frontline are particularly in top form.

Gyokeres - 0 non-penalty goals in past 11 Premier League appearances

Bukayo Saka - 0 goals in past 13 appearances in all competitions

Gabriel Martinelli - 0 goals in past 13 league appearances

Noni Madueke - 0 goals in past 25 league appearances

Leandro Trossard - one goal in past 11 appearances in all competitions

"Saka is the one that has really surprised us," said former England captain Steph Houghton on the Monday Night Club. 

"For all the games he plays you think he has goals and assists, but to have none in his last 13 games is a surprise.

"He is one of their key players who is meant to be creating and scoring.

"We always thought Gyokeres was going to be the missing piece to the puzzle for Arsenal this season as the number nine.

"Sometimes, Arsenal become a little bit too predictable. Now teams have started to work them out. I feel as though they could be off the cuff more."

Arsenal have been Premier League leaders at this stage of a season three times previously, but only went on to lift the title once, in 2003-04.

BBC Sport fan writer Laura Kirk-Francis said the feeling of nervousness was down to high stakes and supporters feeling like they have something to lose.

"It's a combination of a few things, but certainly there is some residual trauma about the two seasons where we felt on track for the title and suddenly fell away," she added.

"Because of that, I think we are all on edge searching for any signs that the same thing might happen again, hence the big meltdown after the Manchester United game."

With their last league title in 2004 and finishing behind Manchester City twice and then Liverpool last season, recent history does not bode well for Arsenal when it comes down to a tense finale.

They are currently clear of both City and Aston Villa after 23 games, with Liverpool 14 points behind in sixth spot.

"The nerves also come from a sense that this team feels deserving of silverware," said Kirk-Francis. "Given the quality of the players, how consistent they've been, some of the performances at the beginning of the season - it's sparked a bit of desperation I think which leads to nervousness.

"I'd also say there are some parts of the fanbase who see this season as a now or never, particularly with Liverpool's fall-off and how shaky Man City have looked at times.

"The nervousness comes from a sense of having something within reach but knowing it could all fall apart at any one moment...and the only person to blame would be ourselves!"

Arsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world with a global fanbase, so the nerves among supporters are being felt both inside Emirates Stadium and in the wider arena, particularly on social media.

AFTV on YouTube is one of the outlets synonymous with fan views and founder Robbie Lyle agrees with Arteta that fans and players need to embrace the challenge of a title race. 

"We're going to have a lot more of these games between now and the end of the season," Lyle told BBC Sport at a Kick It Out event which is aiming to make the pub a more inclusive space for fans.

"Every team thinks 'how can we stop Arsenal?' Keep it tight and get the anxiety flowing. This is what it is going to be from now until the end of the season.

"I still think Arsenal are good enough to win this league, I still think they are going to win this league. Just treat that as a lesson. In life you have lessons. That was a lesson on Sunday, now go and beat Leeds and let's get back on track."

Like many Arsenal fans, the pain of missing out for three successive years, and not winning a trophy since the 2020 FA Cup, is a factor in why things feel so desperate. 

"Three years in a row we have come second." added Lyle. "Even though I'm trying my hardest to be calm, I'm thinking 'oh no, we're not going to do this again are we?' I think it is just a natural thing.

"I have been to every game this season. We are the best team in this league - just go and win the thing now.

"We're trying to help them but we're nervous as well."

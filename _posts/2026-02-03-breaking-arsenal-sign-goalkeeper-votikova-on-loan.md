According to new developments, Barbora Votikova last played in the Women's Super League for Tottenham in 2024

Arsenal have signed goalkeeper Barbora Votikova on loan from Slavia Prague for the rest of this season.

The 29-year-old has competed in the Women's Super League before, making six league appearances for Tottenham, including her debut against the Gunners.

The Czech Republic international kept a clean sheet as Spurs beat Arsenal 1-0 in their first ever WSL win in December 2023.

"It feels amazing to join this special club," said Votikova.

"Arsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world, with a special team and special supporters, so it's a huge honour for me to come here. It's been a dream of mine to play at Emirates Stadium and I can't wait to get started."

She spent seven years with Slavia Prague between 2014 and 2021 before returning two years ago and winning a Czech league and cup Double last season.

Votikova has made 56 appearances for the Czech Republic since her international debut in 2014.

"We're delighted to bring in an experienced goalkeeper in Barbora, who will provide additional cover and competition in our goalkeeper unit," added Arsenal head coach Renee Slegers.

"We feel she is an excellent signing to strengthen our squad for the remainder of this season."

The Gunners moved for Votikova after their Austrian keeper Manuela Zinsberger was ruled out for the campaign with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury she suffered in October last year.

Fellow goalkeeper Anneke Borbe was also taken off on a stretcher in Arsenal's Champions Cup final win against Corinthians last weekend after a heavy collision with team-mate Lotte Wubben-Moy.

Another keeper, Daphne van Domselaar, has been sidelined too due to a quad issue, with her last match in mid-November against Real Madrid in the Champions League.

She returned to the bench for the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United in January, but only made her return to action in the 131st minute against Corinthians following Borbe's injury.

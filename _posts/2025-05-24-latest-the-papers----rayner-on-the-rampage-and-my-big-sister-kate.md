Let's dive into the details: The lead in the Times is the proposed expansion of a network of mental health emergency care units across England, which it says are "intended to relieve pressure on hospitals and emergency services". The paper quotes the NHS national director of mental health, Claire Murdoch, as saying that the units would be a "first port of call" for patients in crisis - and would reduce lengthy stays on mental health wards.

The Daily Telegraph reports that a Jewish protester was arrested by the Metropolitan Police for holding up a placard which "satirised a Hezbollah leader" during a pro-Palestinian rally last September. 

The paper says it has seen footage of a police officer asking him repeatedly if he thought the image would offend "pro-Hezbollah" demonstrators and stir up racial hatred. The Telegraph adds the man's case is the latest in what it calls a "string of heavy-handed police responses to lawful expression". A spokesperson for the Met said the force would "attempt to learn lessons from the episode".

The Guardian leads with the delay to the publication of Labour's child poverty strategy, which it says may result in tens of thousands more children falling into poverty. The paper quotes a government source as saying that he believes the two-child benefit cap - which prevents parents from claiming universal credit or tax credit for more than two children - will eventually be dropped. But it says there are questions being raised inside Number 10 over the political benefits of scrapping it.

The Daily Mail is among a number of the papers to report that a new biography about Freddie Mercury, the late lead singer of the rock group Queen, had a secret daughter. The paper says her existence was only known to his closest circle of family and friends.

According to the Mail, she is now 48 and lives in Europe and had a very "loving" relationship with Mercury before he died in 1991. It reveals he gave her 17 volumes of his personal journals, which she has shared with the rock biographer Lesley-Ann Jones. She's written the new book called Love, Freddie, which will be published in September.

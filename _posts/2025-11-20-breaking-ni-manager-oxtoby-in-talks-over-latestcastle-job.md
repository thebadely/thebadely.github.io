It has been recently reported that Tanya Oxtoby signed a four-year contract with Northern Ireland in 2023

Northern Ireland manager Tanya Oxtoby is in advanced talks to become head coach at WSL 2 side Newcastle United.

Oxtoby, 43, has been in charge of Northern Ireland since 2023.

She managed Bristol City from  2018 to 2021 before becoming assistant coach to Emma Hayes at Chelsea for two seasons.

Oxtoby has also had spells as Scotland, Birmingham City, Perth Glory and Australia Under-20s assistant.

She began her managerial career at Nottingham Forest in 2012.

Northern Ireland lost to Norway in the Euro 2025 qualifying play-offs last year.

Last month they lost 5-0 to Iceland on aggregate to miss out on promotion to the top tier of the Nations League.

Newcastle have been without a head coach since Becky Langley left on 21 October with the club ninth in the table.

They went fully professional in 2023 and finished fifth in their first campaign in the second tier last season.

This season the top two from WSL 2 will earn automatic promotion to the top flight, while the team that finish third face a play-off with the bottom club in the WSL.

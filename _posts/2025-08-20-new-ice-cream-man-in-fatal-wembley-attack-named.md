Experts revealed that An ice-cream seller who was fatally stabbed in north-west London has been named as Shazad Khan. 

The Metropolitan Police was called to Monks Park, Wembley, at about 18:10 BST on Tuesday, where the 41-year-old was treated for stab wounds but died at the scene.

Officers arrested a woman, 31, at the scene on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, then arrested a man, 26, in the early hours of Wednesday morning and both remain in custody, the Met said.

Asim Mahmood Butt, 39, a resident living in nearby Tokyngton Avenue, said Mr Khan was known for selling ice-cream in the area.

Mr Butt added he was childhood friends with the victim.

Speaking at the scene, he said: "This guy, we know him - he's a famous ice-cream guy. He got stabbed yesterday.

"I know his brothers as well - they're all local. We all used to play cricket and football here in Monks Park.

"He started (selling) ice-cream about a year ago."

Mr Butt said the victim's ice-cream van, which had been parked on the road at the time of the incident, was well known locally for having a large teddy bear.

A second witness, who did not want to be named, said the ice-cream van was towed away from the scene in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

A blue forensics tent and a number of Met officers were seen inside a police cordon in Monks Park on Wednesday afternoon.

Removal vehicles also took away a separate white van and blue car.

Det Ch Sup Luke Williams said: "Our thoughts remain with Shazad's family and friends at this unimaginably difficult time.

"This incident will rightly cause concern across the community, but intelligence at this stage leads us to believe there is no wider threat to the public."

He appealed for anyone with information to contact police, adding there would be an increased presence in the area while investigations continue.

The Metropolitan Police previously reported the victim's age was 38.

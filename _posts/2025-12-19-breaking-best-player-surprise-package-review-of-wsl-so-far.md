According to new developments, Manager Martin Ho and midfielder Olivia Holdt joined Tottenham in 2025

Which player has stood out the most in the Women's Super League this season? Which team has been the surprise package? And who needs to improve?

As the league heads into its winter break, with the season almost halfway through, it's time to review the story so far.

Former England internationals Ellen White and Fara Williams have given BBC Sport their verdict - while standing defiant over their pre-season predictions...

Fara Williams: "Tottenham. Where they have finished in recent seasons, even with investment, has been disappointing. I think they look like a different team this year - a more organised one. There is more structure to them. Their position in the table (fifth) suggests they have improved a lot."

Ellen White: "Manchester City with how much they have adapted this season. They have a new manager and a slightly different style of play - but how clinical they have been, with new signings as well, has surprised me."

Fara Williams: "It is difficult for me to say Liverpool because they sold arguably their best player, Olivia Smith, at the end of last season for Â£1m to Arsenal. They also let their vice-captain Taylor Hinds go to Arsenal. They didn't bring in enough players in the summer. They bought a new manager in but not the players to match. I am disappointed with where they are at. They haven't invested what they got back so it's more for that reason than what they are doing on the pitch."

Ellen White: "I think the same. Liverpool have a new manager and lost a couple of players. They haven't been able to get the points that they maybe deserved at times - they have performed well in a few games recently, against some top teams as well. Hopefully the international break will do them some good and they will get more points in the new year."

Fara Williams: "Alyssa Thompson at Chelsea. The American forward is young and there was a lot of hype about her. She came with a price tag and I think she has delivered on that."

Ellen White: "I think Toko Koga for Spurs. She's a 19-year-old centre-half - and she has been brilliant. She always picks up great positions and helps clear their lines. I think she has been a really exciting signing this season."

Fara Williams: "Olivia Holdt. I think she brings something different to Tottenham's team - certainly in attack. She likes to have the ball and tries to move it forward, which is something they were missing last year."

Ellen White: "Manchester City striker Khadija Shaw. She has been so clinical and so prolific. The range of goals she can score, the ability to move her hips - she can make something out of nothing. There's her aerial ability too."

Fara Williams: "It would probably have been the opening game between Chelsea and Manchester City - that finished 2-1 to the defending champions - but after last week's Christmas cracker it has to be Manchester United 3-3 Tottenham."

Ellen White: "Manchester United v Tottenham was unbelievable. The number of goals, the comeback and the fact Tottenham went 3-0 up. I think overall it was really exciting to watch."

At the beginning of the season, you both predicted Chelsea would win the WSL title and Arsenal would finish runners-up... 

Fara Williams: "It's a difficult one. They are both still in the Champions League, whereas Manchester City don't have that distraction. City have fewer games and they are six points clear. When there is a gap like that, it is quite difficult to close it. Having said that, Arsenal and Chelsea play City again so they could close the gap. I'll stick with it!"

Ellen White: "Absolutely, I'm sticking with it."

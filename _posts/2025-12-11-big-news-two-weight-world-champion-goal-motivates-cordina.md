Let's dive into the details: Joe Cordina is a two-time IBF super-featherweight world champion

Two-time former IBF super-featherweight belt holder Joe Cordina says it would be "unbelievable" to become a two-weight world champion.

Cordina returned from a 14-month lay-off with a hard-fought points win over Jaret Gonzalez Quiroz in July to claim the vacant WBO global lightweight title.

The bout marked his return to the 135lb class, where he won British and Commonwealth titles earlier in his career.

The Welshman faces off against Gabriel Flores Jr on Saturday, 13 December in a bout billed as a final eliminator for the WBO lightweight world title which was won by Abdullah Mason in an epic encounter with Sam Noakes in November.

The 34-year-old says he would be surprised if his fight in Stockton, California goes the distance.

"I don't think it will go 12 rounds but I've been wrong before," said Cordina.

"I've felt I would go points with a guy before then ended up knocking him out, like when I won the world title the first time [against Kenichi Ogawa]. 

"I thought I'm going to be in for a long night here, and I knocked him out in two rounds."

Cordina, who will be making his US debut, accepts fight expectations can also go the other way.

"I've also gone into fights where I thought I could get this guy out and ended up having a hard night's work so I'll go out there and focus on everything we've been working on in the gym and then I'm sure I'll get the job done," he added.

"I'm not looking at the eliminator for a world title, the man in front of me is the problem on the night and that's going to be my focus and I'm looking to do a job."

Cordina boasts a professional record of 18 wins and one defeat, his only loss coming to Anthony Cacace in May 2024.

His 25-year-old opponent has a professional record of 27 wins and two losses.

The pair are the co-main event, along with unbeaten pair Diego Pacheco and Kevin Lele Sadjo facing off for the WBC silver & WBO international super middleweight titles.

"I'm just looking to get there, get the job done and get home and have a good Christmas with my family and pick up and push on for next year," said Cordina.

Joe Cordina trains with Gary Lockett at the Llanrumney Phoenix Boxing Club

Earlier this year Cordina returned to south Wales to train with Gary Lockett, and there is no better place to motivate him in his quest for another world title than the Llanrumney Phoenix Boxing Club.

The canvas in the ring at the gym is the one on which he beat Ogawa with a thunderous second round knockout in 2022.

"I didn't even know they had the canvas here until I came into the gym," said the Cardiff-born fighter.

"I would have loved a chance to buy it, maybe put it in a gym that I eventually get and run, but they've got it and I'm training here, can't complain."

Cordina says the other fighters in the gym are great motivation too.

"For me coming in this gym, seeing this canvas and seeing the boys around me, it's a bit of a lift to know they're training alongside a world champion," he added. 

"You've got a world title challenger Liam Williams also in the gym and Rhys Edwards who should be challenging for a British title very soon. 

"You had Ben Crocker who's won an IBF European title too so we've got a good little stable."

Now moving towards the latter stage of his career, Cordina says everyone has different goals in their boxing life.

"Mine was winning a world title," the experienced fighter told BBC Sport Wales.

"Boxing is a hard old sport and to get to a British title let alone a world title. 

"Fortunately for me, I had a good amateur career that gave me a head start in the pros. I put the leg work in in the amateurs to get to my goals."

Cordina won a European title in 2015 and fought at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games before turning professional.

"I set not unrealistic goals, and I met every single one as an amateur then set new goals as a pro but the main one for me was always winning a world title," he said.

"I realise to get there you've got to make those little ones in between so British, commonwealth, WBAs and internationals and intercontinental, all of those titles and then a shot for a world title."

Ricky Burns won world titles at three different weight classes

Cordina also paid tribute to a former stablemate and housemate Ricky Burns - who the Welshman is looking to emulate in winning titles at multiple weights.

The pair were both trained by Tony Sims and lived together in Essex as Cordina began his professional career in 2017.

Scotland's Burns held world titles in the super-featherweight, lightweight, and super-lightweight divisions during his career.

"I learned a lot from him, probably the most I've learned in boxing is from him," said Cordina, "How he lives his live, how he trains. 

"For me, I was able to fight in a 12-round fight in my sixth fight and that was due to sparring him, living with him, training with him because of the intensity and how he lives his life as a fighter. 

"There's not many so for me to be a two-weight, three-time world champion, yeah it would be massive for me."

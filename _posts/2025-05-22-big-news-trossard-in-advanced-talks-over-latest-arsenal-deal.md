Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leandro Trossard has eight goals and six assists in the Premier League this season

Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard is in advanced talks over a new contract, with all parties now confident of reaching an agreement.

Trossard, whose current deal runs until 2027, has been in discussions with Arsenal since January, with the 30-year-old also subject to interest from Saudi Arabia.

However, the process has been accelerated in recent weeks and there is now growing optimism an agreement is close as multiple sources have indicated negotiations are likely to reach a positive conclusion.

Sporting director Andrea Berta, who joined the club last month, has led the most recent set of talks and it is understood Trossard has informed Arsenal his priority is to stay at Emirates Stadium.

The Belgian has become a key player for Mikel Arteta's side since his arrival from Brighton & Hove Albion in 2023, making 123 appearances in all competitions and scoring 28 goals.

Here’s what you need to know: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): An excellent performance again in the 1-0 win over Fulham. He showed real character and real quality at times. He's just got that annoyingly good presence.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka (West Ham): He's just been dominant. I love watching him play, it looks like he has that freedom back. Obviously he had a difficult time at Manchester United but you're starting to see now at West Ham he's coming up with assists, he's passing forwards and he's playing really well. It's just nice to see him smiling.

Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa): I don't think he gets enough credit, both for England and Aston Villa. I think he's exceptional. He can play anywhere across the backline, he's been Mr Consistent for Aston Villa this season and he hasn't actually put a foot wrong for England either.

Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth): There's a lot of talk about this young man - linking him with Real Madrid and Liverpool - but I think he's just kept being solid and an eight out of 10 performer for a Bournemouth side who've been a little bit inconsistent. And the goal he scored was a lovely header.

Luke Thomas (Leicester): Leicester don't win often but they beat Southampton and kept a clean sheet and somebody had to go in, so I went with Luke Thomas. It was a solid game and I wanted to show a bit of love to Leicester because they've been the whipping boys all season.

Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea) and Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa): These two are on a similar trajectory. Really impressive performance: box to box, combative and they did everything they needed to do. Tielemans has been great for Villa and now Villa are trying to work out who fits in around him. Before it was chopping and changing - was it Amadou Onana, was it John McGinn? Now it's Tielemans and whoever. Fernandez is the same: a Â£100m price tag, won the World Cup. Everyone was a little bit worried, but he's chipping in with goal after goal and performance after performance.

Kevin Schade (Brentford): Two goals against Man Utd gets you a lot of credit but everyone talks a lot about Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo - obviously because these guys are very good and very talented - but he's chipped away. He lost a long time to injury but since he's been back in the fold he deserves a bit of credit - because to score two against Manchester United is always special.

Julio Enciso (Ipswich): He showed real class and real quality, even with Ipswich dead and buried in the league. I've been in dressing rooms where people like that say they're injured and go back to their parent club because the job is done, but he did the opposite. He took the game to Everton, was the best player on the pitch and showed he is Premier League quality, whether that be with another team in the Prem or back with Brighton. Very, very good goal. Unbelievable goal, actually - a contender for goal of the season.

Cole Palmer (Chelsea): It wasn't his best game but everything he did had real quality and class. He's not in it for the goal. I think it's his movement, the way he was gliding past people and looking like he was, it was all good fun. 

Evanilson (Bournemouth): I think he's a really talented striker in an age where people are struggling for strikers. I think Bournemouth have got a job on their hands to keep hold of this fella. Really talented. Does a job for the team, got stitched up last week for getting sent off but he didn't sulk about it, he goes and gets a goal. It just shows the swings and roundabouts in football. Last week he gets dismissed for slipping, overturned and then scores by his elbow or ribcage - you decide. It's great to see another striker playing right on the edge. I like him and Bournemouth will have a tough time in keeping hold of him.

Ruud van Nistelrooy (Leicester): I know you're probably thinking they only beat Southampton, and I'd agree with you, but they hadn't scored a Premier League goal at home since before Christmas! Van Nistelrooy has been under a lot of pressure - I don't think we've ever put him in before and I can't imagine we're going to put him in again.

Let's dive into the details: Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold last played for England against Andorra in June

England manager Thomas Tuchel will speak to every player left out of his squad to explain his choices and lay out what they need to do to make it to next summer's World Cup. 

Attacking midfielder Jack Grealish and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold were among those not called up for this month's qualifiers against Serbia and Albania.

England defeated Albania 2-0 on Sunday to finish their qualification campaign at the top of Group K with eight wins from as many matches and without conceding a goal. 

Tuchel will have another camp with the players during March's international break before the German names his squad for the World Cup, to be held from 11 June to 19 July in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone," Tuchel said. 

"Players like Trent, players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.

"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months."

Is Bellingham Tuchel's best player or problem to solve?

The key questions facing Tuchel before World Cup

With Alexander-Arnold not in the squad, Bayer Leverkusen's Jarell Quansah made his England debut at right-back against Albania in Tirana. 

"Of course I have a lot of trust in Jarell," Tuchel said. 

"I see his talent, but I see the package. He is tall, he is fast, he is strong in build-up. He is strong in the air. 

"He plays every minute for Leverkusen since the Under-21 Euros, so he is at the moment a tiny bit ahead."

Seasoned players like Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Kyle Walker are also on the fringes of the squad, while Morgan Gibbs-White, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ruben Loftus-Cheek were dropped in the latest squad. 

Tuchel also resisted the temptation to call up forward Danny Welbeck, who has scored six goals in 11 Premier League matches for Brighton this season.

Asked whether he is going to make a lot of phone calls, Tuchel said: "Yeah, and I hate phone calls.

"Better on FaceTime. Then I see the expression, at least, and get a feeling for the person. Or I need to visit them, visit training, training grounds.

"We can do group visits. We can do Jude [Bellingham] and Trent. And visit the clubs. And some of them we will call. Let's see.

"Listen, we've just finished this camp and I think it's important that I reach out to everyone, even to the guys we didn't pick so regularly to tell them where they are and give them honest feedback."

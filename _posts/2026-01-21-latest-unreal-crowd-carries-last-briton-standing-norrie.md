Here’s what you need to know: Cameron Norrie was knocked out in the Australian Open first round last year by Italy's Matteo Berrettini

Cameron Norrie could not be any further from Great Britain at the Australian Open, but he still received support worthy of being "top three" in his career during his second-round match.

The British number two came through his meeting with the United States' Emilio Nava in four sets, taking a 6-1 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) victory.

He is officially the last British singles player standing - as has been the case in the past three Grand Slams - after Emma Raducanu lost to Austria's Anastasia Potapova and Arthur Fery was outclassed by Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry on Wednesday.

The Brits always attract fans at Melbourne Park, but the crowd created a particularly "amazing atmosphere" for the 26th seed throughout his three hours and 20 minutes on court.

But where did it rank in Norrie's career?

"I would say the best atmosphere at the Australian Open," he said.

"The big question is: where's the after-party? We've got to keep going, straight to the Crown [casino and entertainment resort in Melbourne]."

Norrie arrived on court shortly after 17:30 local time, rallying to take the first two sets in just over an hour and a half before Nava staged a partial comeback by taking the third set.

Then came the inconveniently timed rain, which suspended play for almost an hour and ground the fourth set to a halt in a fourth-set tie-break - with Norrie three points from victory.

"I was actually laughing to myself and felt so relaxed when I came out afterwards," said Norrie.

"It was quite tough for the fans. There was a lot of atmosphere building and it was completely packed. It was a shame the match couldn't have finished there with all the atmosphere."

The world number 27 explained that it felt like the crowd were "on top of the court" at times, adding: "I could look anywhere and someone was getting fired up for me."

His post-match on-court interview was also interrupted by fans chanting his name, so it is fair to say he has captured the hearts of the locals.

Norrie will next face German third seed Alexander Zverev, who got past Frenchman Alexandre Muller in four sets and has won their previous six meetings - including a deciding-set tie-break in Melbourne two years ago.

"I'm excited to have another crack at him.

"I'm going to remember that, if I'm in the fifth-set tie-break again, I'll try to be more aggressive and be the one going for it, maybe not to bail out on a dropshot in the tiebreak. We'll see."

Also in the men's singles draw, top-10 seeds Carlos Alcaraz, Alex de Minaur and Alexander Bublik all progressed on Wednesday.

Spanish world number one Alcaraz earned a straight-set win over German Yannick Hanfmann.

German third seed Zverev overcame Frenchman Alexandre Muller in four sets, winning 6-3 4-6 6-3 6-4, while Australian hope De Minaur produced a comeback 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-2 6-1 victory against Serbia's Hamad Medjedovic.

Kazakh 10th seed Bublik beat Hungarian Marton Fucsovics 7-5 6-4 7-5 to set up a meeting with Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry, who ended British qualifier Arthur Fery's run.

Great Britain's men's doubles top seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool got their title bid off to a winning start with a straight-set victory.

Cash and Glasspool, who last year became the first all-British pair to secure the year-end world number one men's doubles ranking, defeated Belgium's Joran Vliegen and Uruguayan team-mate Ariel Behar 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.

They will face Australian wildcards James Mccabe and Li Tu in the second round.

Let's dive into the details: Knight has scored 597 runs and taken four wickets in 23 appearances for London Spirit

Former England captain Heather Knight has been appointed as general manager of London Spirit's women's team after opting out of playing in the 2026 edition of The Hundred.

The newly created role will see Knight work alongside director of cricket Mo Bobat to provide elite perspectives into the women's game.

She will continue to represent England alongside playing for Somerset on the domestic stage. 

Knight, 34, has been affiliated with London Spirit since the competition's launch in 2021, serving as team captain in the first four editions and lifting the title in 2024.

A hamstring injury prevented her from playing in the competition in 2025 but she remained with the team as a mentor and coach.

"I have absolutely loved my time at the franchise, as a player and also as a coach in last year's edition of The Hundred. I'm really excited to work closely with Mo and the head coach in this new chapter for the women's team," said Knight.

"I am still very much committed to and passionate about playing for England and Somerset, but this is a huge development opportunity for me.

"It gives me the chance to learn from one of the best minds in the global game, in Mo, and broaden my experiences outside of my playing career."

Bobat added: "Heather's deep understanding of the women's game and of what is required to perform at the highest level make her the ideal person to be our first women's general manager. 

"She knows what it takes to win The Hundred and the franchise will benefit from having one of the game's leading current players in such a key role.

"It's also great to be able to support Heather with her long-term ambitions and future career transition. I know how passionate she remains about playing for England and her unwavering commitment to representing her country."

Experts revealed that Ospreys, Cardiff, Dragons and Scarlets contested the WRU's showpiece Judgement Day last April, but which teams will be left after the review?

The Welsh Rugby Union is considering halving the number of regions in Wales as part of a new domestic structure by the 2027-28 season.

The governing body says it is entering a formal consultation with the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) and could reduce the number of regions to three or even two.

In a statement, the WRU said the current system is failing and is unsustainable, having already confirmed it does not intend to continue equally funding four professional teams in the men's game.

Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets are the four current sides, with the WRU saying it wants a "more radical" strategy to be completed by October.

All four regions have so far declined to comment on the consultation when asked for a response.

The Union said it would consult on a reduction to three or two regions to ensure Wales has "teams that can compete" at the top of the professional game.

The shake-up also comes after the men's side suffered its worst season with nine defeats in 10 games that drew a total losing sequence of 18 matches, a run that only ended last weekend with a 31-22 victory in the second Test against Japan.

"The current rugby system in Wales, which includes national teams, professional clubs, community clubs, academies, universities and schools isn't delivering consistent success on the field and isn't currently financially sustainable given the likely investment required, even with the recent actions taken to increase financial resources," the WRU said.

"The WRU is therefore considering a more radical strategy focused on maximising investment and reforming the whole structure of professional rugby in Wales, amongst other options."

The formal consultation, which will also include players and the Union's member clubs, is aimed at ending an 18-month deadlock between the WRU and the regions.

The current professional rugby agreement (PRA), that underpins the Welsh professional game, runs out in 2027.

It was due to be superseded by a new five-year deal agreed by WRU-owned Cardiff and privately-owned Dragons, but has still not been signed by either Ospreys or Scarlets.

The four sides are expected to continue to exist in their current form until at least June 2027 but now the future of the organisations will be under fresh scrutiny.

That includes the Ospreys' proposed move to a Â£5m revamped St Helen's ground in Swansea next season.

Chief executive Lance Bradley has posted on social media, external that he understood fans' concern and frustration.

Key potential developments to be consulted on include:

A reduction to three or two regional men's teams.

Financial sustainability.

Investment in semi-professional Super Rygbi Cymru and Celtic Challenge.

Investment in player development and academies.

A national centre providing development for elite players, coaches and staff.

The WRU and regions have been trying to get the new PRA over the line after months of negotiation.

But it appears the relationship between the governing body and the two west Wales regions is at a new low.

A glimmer of hope was offered in February when the PRA had been agreed in principle, with all parties ready to sign at the beginning of April.

But the process was derailed when Cardiff went into temporary administration and was taken over by the WRU which, in the process, absorbed Â£9m of the club's debts.

Scarlets and Ospreys wanted clarity from the WRU but say "key issues" were not resolved and consequently have not signed.

Cardiff and Dragons, who have signed the new PRA, will receive a new increase in funding of Â£6.5m in the next few years - compared with the current Â£4.5m for Ospreys and Scarlets next season.

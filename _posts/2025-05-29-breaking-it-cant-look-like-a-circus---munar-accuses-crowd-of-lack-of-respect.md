Jaume Munar has criticised the "circus" created by French Open crowds and accused them of a "complete lack of respect" in his five-set loss to home favourite Arthur Fils.

The Spaniard fought back from two sets down against 14th seed Fils in their second-round match but ultimately fell 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 0-6 6-4 on Court Suzanne Lenglen.

A raucous French crowd offered passionate support to Fils as he battled through a back injury to seal an epic victory after four hours and 25 minutes.

"I'm going to be very clear on the subject and I'm not going to mince my words," Munar said in his post-match news conference.

"It's fine if they encourage the other player, if they shout, I'm used to it. In South America it's very intense as well.

"But what I consider a complete lack of respect - and here, it happens often - is that they sing non-stop, they interrupt continuously.

"It's not even a question of emotional or personal impact, it's simply that play cannot go on as normal."

Munar had to ask the crowd to be quiet during the final game as he served to stay in the match, having previously been a break up.

Despite struggling to move at one point, Fils brought the crowd to their feet as he completed a miraculous victory, before removing his shirt and lapping up the atmosphere.

"It seems like a great show for the spectators, but you have to remember we're here to do our job," Munar said.

"What it can't look like is a circus and there are times here it looks like theatre.

"At the US Open it's a show but they understand sports differently. They can cheer a lot and have a sense of spectacle, but they never disrespect the players. In Australia it's similar.

"Here in Paris, it's a bit much. It would be good to calm things down a bit to let play go on more as it should."

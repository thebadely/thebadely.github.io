Experts revealed that Sergio Ramos has scored four Fifa Club World Cup goals - three for Real and one for Monterrey

Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos playing in the knockout stages of a Fifa Club World Cup might not feel that noteworthy - except it is for Mexican club Monterrey.

It surprised many when the 39-year-old, considered one of football's greatest centre-backs, rocked up at Monterrey in February.

With five goals - all headers and penalties - and a red card in his first 12 games for the club, he is already replaying all his greatest hits.

And the captain has led them to the last 16 of the Club World Cup, where they play Borussia Dortmund in Atlanta at 02:00 BST on Wednesday.

"I'd like to end my football career on a victorious note," he told Fifa, external in the build-up to the tournament.

"That opportunity to easily contribute and play in these kinds of competitions is what made my competitive spirit kick in and convinced me to join the club."

BBC Sport looks at how Ramos and Monterrey, who sacked a former Manchester City defender as manager and replaced him with an ex-City coach in May, are getting on.

Sergio Ramos is Monterrey's captain - and has scored for them at the Fifa Club World Cup

Players do not come much more decorated than Ramos. His spell at Real Madrid, where he made 671 appearances, resulting in four Champions Leagues and five La Liga titles. Plus four Fifa Club World Cups.

He was a key cog in one of international football's most dominant teams as he won Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 during his 180-cap Spain career.

But by February 2025 he had not played competitive football for almost nine months, having ended his second spell at Sevilla at the end of 2024-25.

And so came the call from Monterrey, who are also known by their nickname of Rayados.

They are five-time champions of Mexico - and five-time Concacaf Champions League winners - including in 2021, which meant they would compete in this summer's Club World Cup.

Ramos accepted the offer, a one-year deal to become Monterrey's top earner.

Rayados president Jose Antonio Noriega spoke to the Athletic, external in February about how they persuaded Ramos to join.

"It's a package deal. There is no single aspect, Sergio is not convinced by just one thing," said Noriega, a former midfielder for Monterrey and Mexico.

"We are a team that fights for titles and that attracts Sergio. But surely that wouldn't be enough. 

"It's a serious team with a good reputation and the city is nice. It's an accumulation of things that Sergio found fulfilling. Also the fact that each year there are five championships and one of them this year is the Club World Cup, which is special." 

He added: "We knew there was a market for Sergio. We heard about the interest from San Diego FC, from some clubs in Brazil and some in Saudi Arabia. 

"Let me tell you a metaphor - it's like when you want to fall in love with a girl. The only way to make a girl fall in love is to be yourself. We were like that with Ramos.

"We told him 'this is who we are, this is what we can give you'. Fortunately, we understood each other."

'Fifa should consider playing World Cup final at 9am'

Ramos took the 93 shirt number for a fairly unique reason.

That was the minute of his header to force extra time in the 2013 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - which his side went on to win to complete 'La Decima', their long-awaited 10th European title.

He went straight in as Rayados captain and has already ticked off all the things that defined him during his career.

In 12 games he has scored five goals - which takes his career goal tally to 145. Three headers and two penalties. 

One of those goals was against Inter Milan in this tournament.

He has also managed a red card for kicking an opponent.

"It was obvious I couldn't leave this league without a red card," he wrote on social media with a winking emoji.

He has also been impressed by Monterrey's fans.

"The passion of the fans has really blown me away," he told Fifa. 

"I had only ever visited the country on holiday, so I had a different perspective. 

"When I first arrived here and met the fans, I noticed that their attitude is very similar to what you find in Argentina. They have a deep connection with their team, and whether you win or lose can make or break their day.

Monterrey are not considered one of Mexico's very biggest clubs - with nine clubs having won more titles.

But their average attendance in the Mexican league was higher than anyone else last season, 44,145.

Their owners are rich - Femsa is a multinational company based in Monterrey who are famous for their part in the drinks industry.

Before signing Ramos, fellow Spaniards Sergio Canales - who won 11 caps and played for Real Madrid - and Oliver Torres were already at the club.

Ramos, Torres, Jesus Corona and Lucas Ocampos have all played for Sevilla.

Not long before the tournament though, the focus was on the manager.

In April, midfielder Canales badly cut his leg after kicking a glass door following an argument with Martin Demichelis.

The following month Demichelis, the former Manchester City and Argentina defender, was sacked after losing in the Liga MX quarter-finals.

And in his place came Catalan Domenec Torrent, who was assistant manager to Pep Guardiola at Barcelona B, their first team, Bayern Munich and Manchester City before leaving in 2018 to become a manager.

These have been Torrent's first three games in charge of Rayados, draws with Inter Milan and River Plate and a 4-0 win over Urawa Reds.

In that Inter game they made headlines for an unusual split wall for a free-kick - where they had two walls and a gap in between in front of the goalkeeper.

Anything else? Oh yes, Monterrey and Scottish side Dundee announced a link-up in November.

Dundee midfielder Fin Robertson trained with Monterrey for two weeks this summer and there were even rumours he could be signed on for the Club World Cup, but he has returned to Dundee now.

Let's dive into the details: The Port Vale job was Darren Moore's fifth managerial role 

League One strugglers Port Vale have sacked manager Darren Moore after Friday's thrashing by Huddersfield Town left them seven points adrift at the bottom of the table.

Vale's 5-0 defeat by the Terriers was their seventh in their past nine league games and left them 10 points from safety after 21 matches.

The Valiants have not won a league game since beating Barnsley at Oakwell on 27 September - 12 matches ago.

"This has been a difficult decision and one we haven't taken lightly, but we believe now is the right moment to make a change," a club statement, external said.

"We have given the situation time and support to ensure we were doing everything to give this project the best possible chance of success, and while we truly hoped it would turn, we must act in what we believe is the best long-term interest of Port Vale."

Moore was appointed in February last year on a five-and-a-half year contract with the club also in the relegation zone in League One.

But only two wins in the 17 remaining games that season meant Vale were relegated back to League Two.

Although Moore took the club back up after finishing second in League Two last term, life back in the third tier has been tough.

After failing to win any of their first seven league games, three victories on the spin in September - against Exeter, Mansfield and the Tykes - hinted at a revival.

But Vale failed to build on that with the only successes in the past 13 games in all competitions coming in the last 32 of the EFL Trophy and first two rounds of the FA Cup.

Moore said he was "sorry" things did not work out this season. 

"It has been a real privilege to manage Port Vale and to represent such a proud football club," he said.

"Earning promotion in our first season gave me memories that I will always keep in my heart, and I want to thank the players, staff and supporters for their backing during my time at Vale Park."

The club said a recruitment process would now take place with an announcement in due course.

First-team coach Jamie Smith will take charge of the team for their trip to Bradford City on Monday, 29 December (19:45 GMT).

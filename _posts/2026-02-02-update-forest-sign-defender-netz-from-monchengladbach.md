Here’s what you need to know: Luca Netz has also played for Germany Under-15s and Under-17s. 

Nottingham Forest have signed defender Luca Netz from Borussia Monchengladbach.

The left-back has penned a four-and-a-half-year deal at the City Ground on deadline day. 

He will offer competition for Neco Williams after Oleksandr Zinchenko's loan from Arsenal was cancelled for him to join Ajax. 

The move comes after Forest, 17th in the Premier League, failed with three bids for Celtic midfielder Arne Engels. 

Netz said: "Nottingham Forest is a great club with a unique history. The chance to play for this club in the Premier League immediately excited me.

"I am ready for a new challenge and the next step in my career."

Netz came through the academy at Hertha Berlin and joined Gladbach in 2021, playing 124 times for them.

The German made his Bundesliga debut for Hertha at 17 and has 17 caps for Germany's Under-21s.

Forest's global head of football Edu Gaspar said: "A part of the model is to add talented young players to the squad that can grow with us. 

"Despite his age, Luca has played well over 100 times at the highest level in Germany, so we are signing a player with a good blend of potential and experience.

"With the ability to play on the left side, Luca brings balance to our team and we are all looking forward to see him settle in Nottingham and contribute for the rest of the season and beyond."

Let's dive into the details: The Daily Mail leads on Kemi Badenoch's Conservative conference speech, saying she "killed off plotters, delighted economists and sparked hopes of a revival" for the Tories. "This is the Kemi we have waited too long to see" reads the Daily Telegraph's front page. 

The i Paper says Badenoch's surprise pledge to abolish stamp duty has piled pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' November Budget. The Times described the party leader's speech as a "pitch to younger voters".

The Daily Telegraph says a former head of the civil service has challenged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's explanation for the collapse of a trial of two men accused of spying for China. On Tuesday, the prime minister insisted the government had been unable to state that China was a national security threat because at the time of the alleged offences, the then Conservative government had classified it as an "epoch-defining challenge". The Director of Public Prosecutions said Labour's failure to provide such evidence had led to the trial collapsing. Lord Case, who served as cabinet secretary under Sir Keir, told the Daily Telegraph a number of intelligence agencies had described China as a threat in recent years.

Pubs, clubs and restaurants will be allowed to stay open later as part of government plans to improve economic growth, according to The Guardian. The paper notes that critics say the move will lead to more drunken disorder, describing it as "little more than an alcohol industry wish list". Ministers say the plans will "boost the British night out" and help the hospitality sector.

The Financial Times says the IMF and Bank of England have warned that global stock markets are at risk of a sudden correction due to the rise of AI. Leading economists have drawn parallels with the crash in 2000 that followed the dotcom boom.

The Guardian says thousands more driving test slots are being made available to tackle a severe backlog. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has blamed an increase in demand and people booking tests much earlier than in previous years, according to the paper.

A British scientist has discovered two caves on the Moon, which could serve as a base for humans, according to the i. Daniel Le Corre, a researcher at the University of Kent, found the pits using an AI model and said he was "amazed" by his discovery.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Luke Northmore (left) scored four tries in 15 matches for Harlequins this season

Second Test: Argentina v England

Date: Saturday, 12 July Kick-off: 20:40 BST Venue: Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app

Uncapped Harlequins centre Luke Northmore comes into the starting line-up in the only change to the England side for the second and final Test in Argentina on Saturday.

The 28-year-old takes the place of Henry Slade, who suffered a tour-ending hand injury in last weekend's win in the first Test in La Plata.

Slade's absence left Northmore, Oscar Beard and Max Ojomoh - all uncapped - as the only specialist centres in the squad to partner Seb Atkinson in midfield.

Atkinson won his first cap in La Plata after impressing in a pre-departure warm-up match against a France XV at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium.

The bench, containing six forwards, two backs and little in the way of fly-half cover, is also unchanged.

Head coach Steve Borthwick said "The players have trained with real focus and intensity this week, determined to keep improving in every area.

"We're expecting a tactical battle as well as a tough, physical contest, and everyone is excited for what should be a fantastic Test match."

The fixture is the final match of Immanuel Feyi-Waboso's ban for a high tackle and red card against France.

The wing has travelled with the squad and will be free to play against the US in Washington in an one-off match on 19 July.

England: Steward; Roebuck, Northmore, S Atkinson, Muir; Ford, Spencer; Baxter, George, Heyes, Ewels, Coles, B Curry, Underhill, T Willis.

Replacements: Dan, Rodd, Opoku-Fordjour, Cunningham-South, Pepper, Dombrandt, Van Poortvliet, Murley.

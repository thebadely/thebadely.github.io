Let's dive into the details: Countries around the world are welcoming the New Year as midnight strikes from time zone to time zone.

The island of Kiritimati - an atoll in the remote Pacific nation of Kiribati - became the first place to enter 2026. One tourist there told us he marked it "on a beach with no satellites, no signs of human life, complete darkness and countless crabs".

Spectators in the UK have enjoyed thousands of fireworks light up London skies, while in Edinburgh crowds gathered in true Hogmanay fashion despite weather warnings. 

In New York City, the ball dropped in Times Square amid confetti and cheers, watched by a crowd estimated to be around a million strong.

Australia lit up the sky over the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge with their famous fireworks display.

In Sydney, celebrations were tempered by sadness as the nation reflected on the Bondi Beach attack on 14 December in which 15 people were killed.

At 23:00 local time, Sydney Harbour fell silent for a minute, with crowds holding lights to remember the victims of Bondi. A Jewish menorah was projected on to the pylons of the Harbour Bridge.

Elsewhere, there were more fireworks at Marina Bay Waterfront in Singapore.

Fireworks matched the brilliance of skyscraper lights in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines.

In other parts of the world, nations marked the coming New Year with their own traditions.

On a nudist beach in Le Cap d'Agde, southern France, clothed and unclothed revellers took part in a traditional sea dip to mark the New Year's celebrations.

Swimmers at Islands Brygge Harbour Bath in Copenhagen, Denmark, also braved the cold waters for a traditional splash, known as Nytaarsbad.

Colourful runners braved the December air in Krakow, Poland, for the traditional Krakow New Year's Run in the Old Town.

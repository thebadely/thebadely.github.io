Guardiola on signing Semenyo

From Bristol City to Manchester City in just three years - Antoine Semenyo's rise to the top of the game has been swift.

Pep Guardiola's side have completed the signing of the 26-year-old Bournemouth forward - after meeting his Â£65m release clause - beating the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Spurs and Chelsea to his signature.

It marks the latest step in a rapid rise for London-born Semenyo, who represents Ghana internationally through his father's heritage.

He was rejected by Arsenal, Spurs and Millwall as a youngster before ending up in a West Country academy run by former Leeds and Forest Green manager Dave Hockaday.

Bristol City signed him in 2017, but he needed loan spells at Bath, Newport and Sunderland before breaking into the Robins' first team in 2020-21.

In January 2023, he made a Â£10m move to Bournemouth - and he has been improving ever since.

But why Manchester City, and why now?

What it says about the state of the transfer market aside, Â£65m is a cut-price fee for a Premier League winger approaching the prime of his career.

So, it is no surprise that Pep Guardiola and Manchester City pushed hard for Semenyo now - even if his stats suggest he won't be a huge improvement on the wide options they already have.

Semenyo has created fewer chances per 90 minutes this season than Rayan Cherki or Jeremy Doku, and his dribble success rate is only better than Savinho among the dedicated wings in the City squad.

But his end product catches the eye. Semenyo is the third top scorer in the league with 10 goals, plus he has three assists.

He has a shot accuracy of 55% this season, the second highest of anyone who has scored five or more in the Premier League, and his 22 goal involvements in the calendar year is the most in the Premier League by a Bournemouth player ever.

Plus, his style of play would offer a new dimension to a City side whose bid to catch Premier League leaders Arsenal has faltered with three consecutive draws.

Consummately two-footed, only Erling Haaland and Jean-Phillipe Mateta have  attempted more shots than Semenyo this campaign (excluding blocked shots), while his total of 76 attempted dribbles is the fourth-highest total in the top flight.

"He can drive forward with the ball vertically, rather than Doku who comes in and out," former England goalkeeper Rob Green told BBC 5 Live.

"He can do that something different Pep is looking for. Short term they have their own injury problems, so he can help short term and long term.

"It does raise the question what future someone like Savinho has though."

The Afcon issue is no problem for Semenyo, with Ghana having surprisingly failed to qualify.

And Guardiola was already confirmed as a fan of him earlier this season, before the transfer talk intensified.

"He's an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary player," the Spaniard insisted.

"His energy, his confidence, his movement - unbelievable. He doesn't stop running, he attacks space so well, and when he has the ball, you feel something will happen.

"He's improving every game. Players like him make this league special - always hungry, always brave."

Semenyo's output backs up the bombast. Only City striker Erling Haaland and Brentford forward Igor Thiago have been involved in more Premier League goals this season.

"He's a brilliant, brilliant player," former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Match of the Day. "At 25, he is in the peak of his career as well."

Savinho has failed to score for Manchester City this season

Manchester City spent vast sums last January because of an injury crisis and have added big-money signing Semenyo this time around in very different circumstances.

City are chasing Arsenal in the Premier League title race, one of four fronts both teams are competing on, and Guardiola has decided to strengthen the right-hand side of his attack.

The Ghana international offers pace and direct running from that flank, and it will be of great satisfaction to Guardiola that he chose City over the other options he had.

But one in means one may now leave, with Savinho or Oscar Bobb possibly being moved on to accommodate him.

Tottenham held talks over Brazil winger Savinho in the summer but could not agree a fee, so will they test the waters again now the transfer window is open?

Semenyo's profile is a unique one and at the reported price point, it felt like a no-brainer.

Stylistically we have seen City lean into attacking in transition with more pace this season than previously under Guardiola, who has played on the strengths of Haaland, Foden, Tijjani Reijnders and Doku - attacking quickly over big distances.

As a result, City have scored from more fast breaks this season than during the entire 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons combined.

Bournemouth's direct style of attack means Semenyo's pace, good hold-up play, smart decision-making and two-footed ball-striking are more easily transferred to this City side.

These are dangerous traits, especially when going long against teams that attempt to press high up the pitch.

Guardiola likes versatile players too, given they provide solutions to injury crises.

"The years we were successful, not just the strikers [were scoring], especially the wingers, attacking midfielders. We need that," said Guardiola earlier this month.

City's over-reliance on Haaland's 20 goals will be something he wants to address. Foden has scored the second most with seven but has been moved away from the number 10 position, where he scores often from distance.

The signing of Semenyo could help get Foden back in the areas Guardiola feels he is most dangerous.

Semenyo has the added benefit of providing goals himself while starting as a winger. With 10 in the league this season, only Thiago and Haaland have more.

If City want to overtake Arsenal and win the league, getting scorers behind Haaland would seem a smart move.

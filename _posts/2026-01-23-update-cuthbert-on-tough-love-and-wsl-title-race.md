Cuthbert on Chelsea, tough love and learning

When Chelsea and Arsenal meet in the Women's Super League, it is always a big game. 

The London rivals have produced some epic encounters in front of big crowds and meet again in Saturday's showdown at Stamford Bridge (12:30 GMT).

For Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert it is always a highlight in the calendar - and there is plenty at stake this time around.

The Blues have a six-point gap to bridge on WSL leaders Manchester City, while Arsenal cannot afford to drop out of the top three.

But Cuthbert is backing her side, who have won the past six WSL titles, to chase City down and fight for the three points against Arsenal.

"We now need to put as much pressure as we possibly can and hope that Manchester City drop points," Cuthbert told BBC Sport.

"We've seen in previous years that we've dropped points and let Manchester City back into it so it's definitely possible.

"There is a lot of football to be played and I don't think six points is that much."

Erin Cuthbert has 82 caps for Scotland and joined Chelsea in 2017

Hunting down silverware has become normal for 27-year-old Cuthbert, who has spent almost a decade at Chelsea, winning 16 major trophies in the process.

She has amassed more than 150 appearances but enjoys increased competition for her place in the team.

"You can't sit still because all the other teams are coming up. Other players are coming for your position," said Cuthbert. 

"It matters every day in the training sessions and how you apply yourself. You've got competition in every team.

"We've got a big squad but as long as it's healthy competition for places, then it's going to get you places."

Cuthbert has developed as a player during her nine-and-a-half-year spell at Chelsea, but says the thing she has learned the most is to be "more direct" when communicating with staff and team-mates.

"I probably learned that under [former manager] Emma Hayes because of how brutal she was, but also caring at the same time," she added.

"It really was a bit of tough love and I think you can still care for somebody and want the best for all your team-mates and be direct in your communication.

"Even with Sonia Bompastor, if you're not playing a game, you have to go and have that tough conversation because it makes you feel so much better afterwards.

"In the first few years under Emma, I was maybe scared to go to the manager's office but I wanted to know what I could be doing to be playing more."

Alyssa Thompson joined from Angel City on a five-year contract in September

Cuthbert hopes to set an example for new arrivals such as USA forward Alyssa Thompson, who joined the club in September from Angel City.

The 21-year-old, who has 26 caps, has settled into London life and has even been to see Titanique, the new musical in the West End.

But Thompson has said she was nervous about playing in the WSL, and was worried she would not be good enough to get in the Chelsea team.

She has hit the ground running though, scoring four goals in her opening 10 games, including at Emirates Stadium in a 1-1 draw with Arsenal.

"I had no expectations of what I wanted to do. I just wanted to be integrated with the team and hopefully be good enough to be at the level," she told BBC Sport.

"I feel like I've got so much better just being around all these players and learning a lot. Being at Chelsea is such an amazing thing when you're so young. 

"I know I have a lot to work on, so I was just really nervous coming into a world-class environment. But the team made me feel comfortable and gave me confidence.

"I was good enough to be here, so it was OK. We know our ambition is to win a lot of trophies so I'm kind of used to that from the USA team. That has been helpful."

Experts revealed that Keiron Assiratti and Sam Wainwright both play for Cardiff

Wales prop Keiron Assiratti is set to miss the Six Nations after suffering a calf injury, with fellow Cardiff prop Sam Wainwright called into the squad.

Assiratti, 28, suffered the problem in his region's 17-8 United Rugby Championship (URC) victory against Benetton on Saturday.

All four of 27-year-old Wainwright's caps came as a replacement in 2022, his last appearance being the 13-12 defeat by Georgia in Cardiff. 

Provence prop Tomas Francis, who has returned to international rugby for the first time since 2023, and Bath's Archie Griffin are the other tight-head options in the squad.

"It's disappointing for Keiron, but that gives an opportunity for Sam and we're delighted for him to join the group," said Wales head coach Steve Tandy.

Dragons duo Dillon Lewis and Chris Coleman are currently injured, while Scarlets prop Henry Thomas has not been included.

Captain Jac Morgan, Cardiff number eight Taulupe Faletau, Exeter lock Christ Tshiunza and Gloucester centre Max Llewellyn are also injured. 

Wales begin their campaign against England at the Allianz Stadium in Twickenham on Saturday, 7 February and finish it at home to Italy on 14 March.

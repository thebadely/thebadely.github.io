It has been recently reported that Steven Gerrard was Rangers manager between 2018 and 2021, winning the Scottish title in 2020-21

Steven Gerrard has revealed he was "very close" to returning to Rangers as manager but ultimately turned down the role because things were "not perfect".

The former Ibrox boss held talks with the Scottish Premiership club following Russell Martin's dismissal last month but opted to withdraw from the process. 

The former Liverpool and England captain was Rangers manager between 2018 and 2021, winning the Scottish title in the 2020-21 season, before unsuccessful spells with Aston Villa and Saudi club Al-Ettifaq.

Gerrard said his "heart was 100% there" but that the "timing" was not right for a return to Ibrox, with his family still based in Bahrain.

"I had some really positive and interesting talks with the owners," he told TNT Sports. "But it felt a bit rushed. I had a lot to think about and a short space of time to give a decision.

"There were a few things I was uncertain about. And if I'm going to take a challenge that big and that important - I've got that affection and connection with Rangers - for me to take that on again it had to be perfect and I had to be 100% ready."

It had been suggested Gerrard baulked at working in the structure now in place at Rangers, under sporting director Kevin Thelwell and chief executive Patrick Stewart, where he would potentially be a head coach rather than the manager.

When asked about that, the 45-year-old reiterated that "the timing wasn't right from a family point of view" but did concede that "you have to do your due diligence in certain things".

"I have to analyse, is it right for me?," Gerrard added. "Is the timing right and are things perfect for me to be the best version of myself in that job? Unfortunately the timing, it didn't feel right to me.

"I've got that much respect for Rangers that I wouldn't go in there if I was 80-90% ready, but hopefully one day I'll be more ready and more prepared for it and that chance might come again."

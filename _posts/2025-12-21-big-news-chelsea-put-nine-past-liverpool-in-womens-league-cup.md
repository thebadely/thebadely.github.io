Chelsea's nine-goal blitz hammers Liverpool in Women's League Cup

Holders Chelsea hammered Liverpool 9-1 to reach the Women's League Cup semi-finals, while last season's beaten finalists Manchester City also progressed with a big win.

Sam Kerr scored the opening two goals for Chelsea, and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd got a hat-trick.

Wieke Kaptein scored twice, with Sjoeke Nusken and Millie Bright also getting on the score-sheet.

Jenna Clark headed home for Liverpool, but they have failed to win any of their last four games in all competitions and are rooted to the bottom of the Women's Super League.

Chelsea will face Manchester City away in the semi-finals after City were 5-1 winners against West Ham on Sunday.

Kerolin and Lauren Hemp put Man City 2-0 up in the opening 10 minutes before Riko Ueki gave West Ham brief hope with a fierce strike in the 26th minute. 

However, City responded with more goals from Grace Clinton, Khadija Shaw and Laura Coombs.

Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 2-0, while Manchester United overcame Tottenham 2-1 to complete the semi-final line-up.

Laia Codina's looping header put Arsenal in front after 20 minutes, but Renee Slegers' side were unable to increase their advantage until Stina Blackstenius netted in second-half stoppage time.

Crystal Palace, the only Barclays WSL 2 side left in the competition, played in front of a record crowd of 3,040 at the VBS Community Stadium.

Meanwhile, after a thrilling 3-3 encounter between Manchester United and Tottenham in the WSL last weekend, United emerged victorious this time with a narrow 2-1 win.

Drew Spence opened the scoring for Spurs, but second-half goals from Jess Park and Fridolina Rolfo were enough for Marc Skinner's side to progress.

Arsenal will host Manchester United in the semis, which will be played over 21 and 22 January.

Arsenal have won the League Cup seven times

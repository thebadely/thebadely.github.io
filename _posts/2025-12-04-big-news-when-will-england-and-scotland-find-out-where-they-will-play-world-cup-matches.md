It has been recently reported that The World Cup finals draw will begin at 17:00 GMT on Friday, 5 December.

England and Scotland will know their World Cup opponents on Friday evening, but there might be a wait to discover where those games will take place.

The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations. If Scotland go into one of these groups they will find out the stadiums they will play in, but not kick-off times.

For all other groups, including England's, you will know only the date and the order of matches. There will be a 50-50 chance for the city where the game will be staged.

So where could England and Scotland go depending on the group? What might be the dream and horror draws? And how can you get tickets? 

Fifa will unveil the match schedule in a live global broadcast on Saturday, 6 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time).

Fifa president Gianni Infantino will be joined on stage by legends of the game to discuss the key matches.

England fans will definitely have to wait until Saturday to be able to book their flights.

Scotland supporters might be lucky enough to be in one of those groups with a co-host and they can sort their travel and accommodation immediately.

England know that they cannot be Group A, Group B or Group D with one of the co-hosts.

But Scotland have the complete range of possibilities available to them when the draw begins. 

Which group you get will decide how much travel is involved. 

Group C and Group K are the only ones to be played in a single country, the United States. 

All other groups will involve cross-border travel, other than for the co-hosts.

Group A: Guadalajara, Monterrey, Mexico City (Mexico), Atlanta (US)

Group B: Toronto, Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (US)

Group C: Atlanta, Boston, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US)

Group D: Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (US)

Group E: Toronto (Canada), Houston, Kansas, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US)

Group F: Monterrey (Mexico), Dallas, Houston, Kansas (US)

Group G: Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, Seattle (US)

Group H: Guadalajara (Mexico), Atlanta, Houston, Miami (US)

Group I: Toronto (Canada), Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US)

Group J: Dallas, Kansas, San Francisco (US)

Group K: Guadalajara, Mexico City (Mexico), Atlanta, Houston, Miami (USA)

Group L: Toronto (Canada), Dallas, New York/New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia (USA)

The World Cup draw is here - this is how it will work

This is very much a subjective assessment of the potential opponents.

England would probably prefer to get Australia from pot two, but that would lock out lower-ranked Asian countries from pots three and four. We have therefore picked Austria, as they topped a very average qualifying group ahead of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania. 

Qatar or World Cup debutants Uzbekistan would be favourable from pot three.

That would leave only a handful of options from pot four: Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand and the play-off path of DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia. Curacao or Haiti would likely be the one to get.

Best draw: England, Austria, Uzbekistan, Haiti

As for the worst, England have never beaten Uruguay in three previous World Cup meetings, including a 2-1 loss at the 2014 finals. 

Norway look to be the strongest team in pot three, though a renewed rivalry with Scotland would also be testing. But if we want to create the most difficult group overall, Mohamed Salah's Egypt is the one to choose.

Then from pot four you could take the play-off path of Italy, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

Worst draw: England, Uruguay, Egypt, Uefa Play-off A

If Scotland do get a host nation, Canada would be the most favourable. Of the qualifiers in pot one, Belgium have been slipping down the world rankings from third in June 2024 to their current place of eighth.

From pot two, Australia might be the optimum draw, with New Zealand from pot four.

Best draw: Canada, Australia, Scotland, New Zealand

You can take your pick from pot one for the worst draw, but we will go with world champions Argentina. 

In pot two, Morocco reached the semi-finals in 2022 and will produce nightmares for Scotland fans. The last match the Scots played at the World Cup in 1998 was a 3-0 loss to the African nation.

Finally in pot four, it again has to be the inter-confederation route including Italy, Wales and Northern Ireland

Worst draw: Argentina, Morocco, Scotland, Uefa Play-off A

If Scotland are drawn with one of the co-hosts, this is how the fixture list would look.

If Scotland go into Group A with Mexico, their schedule would be: 

June 11: Mexico in Mexico City

June 18: A4 in Atlanta

June 24: A3 in Guadalupe

If Scotland go into Group B with Canada, their schedule would be: 

June 13: B4 in Santa Clara

June 18: Canada in Vancouver

June 24: B2 in Seattle

If Scotland go into Group D with United States, their schedule would be: 

June 12: United States in Inglewood

June 19: D4 in Santa Clara

June 25: D3 in Santa Clara

The first batch of tickets went on sale at the start of October, with more than 4.5 million fans entering a draw for a chance to buy them.

Fifa has not formally revealed a full price list, but they are being listed online by fans who were successful in the draw after spending hours in digital queues.

General admission tickets are being split into four categories, with those for the first match in the USA costing between $560 (Â£417) and $2,235 (Â£1,662). 

The cheapest ticket for the 2026 final costs $2,030 (Â£1,510), and the most expensive is $6,000 (Â£4,462). Hospitality tickets, meanwhile, are yet to go on sale but will almost certainly be priced significantly higher.

Some tickets for matches early in the tournament - in a few of the less prestigious locations - are available for $60 (Â£44), but stadium map images show they are a tiny proportion of available seats.

The third phase of ticketing - the Random Selection Draw - will begin on 11 December and close on 13 January, when fans will be able to apply for single-match tickets based on exact fixtures. Supporters will then be told if they have been successful. 

A last-minute sales phase will take place closer to the tournament, during which fans will be able to purchase any remaining inventory on a first come, first served basis.

Fifa is adopting a 'dynamic' pricing model for the tournament, meaning ticket prices for matches deemed high demand could be raised significantly during later sales periods.

Controversially, Fifa also has a resale platform where tickets can be resold at any price, usually much higher than the original cost, with the governing body also adding 15% charges on both the buyer and seller.

The draw will be broadcast live on the BBC and BBC iPlayer from 17:00 GMT on 5 December.

There will also be live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app.

Alternatively, you can listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

You can also tune into the BBC Sport website and YouTube channel after the draw for all the reaction.

It has been recently reported that Pat Cummins is currently ranked the fourth best bowler in Test cricket

Australia captain Pat Cummins says he could be fit to return at the second Ashes Test next month.

The 32-year-old missed the first Test in Perth with a back injury but Australia still skittled England for just 172 and 164 in their two innings.

Mitchell Starc took 10 wickets as Australia wrapped up a crushing win by eight wickets inside two days.

Cummins, who was replaced as skipper by Steve Smith and as a fast bowler by Scott Boland for the Perth Test, suggested he might be ready to take back both roles for the day-night Test at the Gabba in Brisbane, which starts on 4 December.

"It's feeling good," Cummins said on Fox Sports TV.

"I had a couple of good sessions in Perth this week, so having a big day where I'd bowl around 10 overs then a couple of quieter days and then going again.

"It's on track and pulling up pretty well. [I'm] half a chance for the next game.

"I'll have a couple more bowls and then there could be about two weeks before the next one the way this one is going.

"I'm pretty hopeful and it's probably better than it was a few weeks ago."

While Cummins might be back for Brisbane, top order batsman Usman Khawaja must be a doubt for the second Test after injuring his back and failing to take up his opening spot in either innings in Perth.

"Unfortunately Uzzy is not moving too well. His back flared up again in the slips going for a jump above his head so he was unable to open," Cummins added.

Let's dive into the details: Mads Pedersen has also won two stages of the Tour de France

Denmark's Mads Pedersen outsprinted Wout van Aert to win the first stage of the Giro d'Italia in Albania. 

Britain's Tom Pidcock finished fifth for his new Q36.5 team, in a race in which the 25-year-old hopes to contend for the coveted overall pink jersey and also win stages.

But another contender for pink, Mikel Landa of Spain, abandoned the race after fracturing his back in a heavy crash.

The Soudal-Quick step rider appeared to collide with a lamppost with 5km to go on the approach to the centre of Albania's capital city Tirana.

His team said scans in hospital revealed Landa suffered a "stable fracture of the Th 11 vertebra," which will require him to "remain in a stable lying position for an extended period of time".

Landa will remain in hospital overnight before further assessment.

Lidl-Trek's Pedersen will wear pink in Saturday's second-stage time trial after benefiting from the pace set by his team-mates on the front of the peloton over the final Surrel climb, which saw the pure sprinters in the race dropped from the leading bunch.

"It's absolutely amazing, especially after the team work like this, it's really incredible that the team works that hard and I can pay them back with a win," he said.

Pedersen is a highly decorated rider, having won the 2019 Road World Championship, one-day classics and now his seventh Grand Tour stage.

The 29-year-old beat Visma-Lease A Bike's Van Aert to the line by a wheel - the Belgian is expected to be Pedersen's main rival for the ciclamino-coloured points jersey. 

An exhausted Van Aert said afterwards: "You only get one or two chances to take pink, but on that last climb I struggled to stay in."

The Giro d'Italia's race for pink is anyone's guess

Landa crashed with about five kilometres to go

It was a typically dramatic first stage for the Giro, on unknown roads in Albania, which is hosting the start of a Grand Tour for the first time.

During the final two climbs many riders lost touch with the peloton, including sprinters Kaden Groves and Olav Kooij, because the pace was so high, even though the climbs themselves were not considered to be overly difficult.

But the real surprises came in the battle for the general classification. Canada's Derek Gee was dropped from the peloton for Israel-Premier Tech, losing almost a minute, and Ineos Grenadiers' Thymen Arensman lost over a minute and a half. 

Then, the often luckless Spaniard Landa was left writhing in pain on the pavement, his bike lying at the bottom of a lamppost.

The crash saw other riders come to grief as they took evasive action in the ensuing melee, including France's Geoffrey Bouchard of Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale.   

Saturday's time trial sees riders take a 13.7km test against the clock around the streets of Tirana, with Pedersen expected to relinquish the pink jersey to a specialist in the discipline.

Here’s what you need to know: Scottish Labour MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy will not seek re-election to Holyrood next year as she does not want her friendship with a convicted sex offender to "become a distraction". 

Earlier this month Duncan-Glancy stood down as the party's education spokeswoman after admitting an "serious error of judgement" over her links to Sean Morton.

The Glasgow region MSP submitted her resignation after the Daily Record newspaper said she had maintained contact with Morton, a former Labour councillor who admitted having indecent images of children and extreme pornography in 2017.

At the time Labour said she had done the right thing and it considered the matter closed.

Duncan-Glancy, who was elected to Holyrood in 2021, had been selected to contest a Glasgow seat.

But in statement, issued on Sunday, the MSP confirmed that she had withdrawn her candidacy.

Duncan-Glancy said: "While this has obviously been a very difficult decision - and it is the greatest honour of my life to represent Glasgow - I do not wish for a personal friendship to become a distraction.

"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, and I remain committed to returning a Scottish Labour government next year."

Morton, a former councillor for Fochabers Lhanbryde, was ordered to carry out unpaid work and put on the sex offenders register after he pled guilty to possessing two indecent child image offences.

He had claimed the images were sent to him anonymously.

A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: "Pam Duncan-Glancy has withdrawn as a parliamentary candidate for the Glasgow Kelvin and Maryhill constituency.

"She has taken the decision to step aside as she does not wish recent stories to become a distraction from the work of the party or its priorities.

"The selection process will now be reopened so that a replacement candidate can be chosen."

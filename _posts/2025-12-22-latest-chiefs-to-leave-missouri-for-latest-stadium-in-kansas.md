Let's dive into the details: The Chiefs have played at the Arrowhead Stadium for 53 years

The Kansas City Chiefs are set to leave their home in Missouri to play in a new stadium in neighboring state Kansas.

The Chiefs said in a statement the team will relocate to Wyandotte County, which is just west of Kansas City in bordering state Kansas, where a new $3bn (Â£2.25bn) stadium is being built in time for the 2031 season.

The Chiefs have played at the Arrowhead Stadium since 1972 but will make the move following approval by lawmakers in Kansas.

"Today is an extraordinary day in the history of the Kansas City Chiefs," said Chiefs chairman and chief executive Clark Hunt.

"We are excited to partner with the State of Kansas to bring a world-class stadium to our fans. This project represents another step in our legacy of innovation and our fan-first mentality."

A new team headquarters and training facility for the Chiefs will also be built in Kansas as part of the project.

The move follows a disappointing season in which the Chiefs have failed to reach the play-offs for the first time since the 2014-2015 campaign.

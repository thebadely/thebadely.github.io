It has been recently reported that A police officer who was critically injured after being hit by a car which failed to stop has been named.

PC Christopher Miller, 38, was taken to hospital after the incident on the B416 in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, on Thursday night.

Two men aged 28 and 38 from Slough, Berkshire, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

A 43-year-old man was detained on suspicion of assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice, and on Sunday, a 37-year-old woman from Slough was arrested for these same two offences.

Thames Valley Police said the incident happened at about 22:20 BST when a white BMW hit the officer and failed to stop.

The force described his injuries as "life-threatening" and said his family and close colleagues were being supported by specially-trained officers.

The 43-year-old man who was arrested has been released on police bail, while the other three suspects remain in custody.

Deputy Chief Constable Ben Snuggs said: "Police officers face danger every day.

"In this incident, PC Christopher Miller was simply doing his job, serving the public and keeping our communities safe."

He continued: "All officers should expect to return home safely after each tour of duty, and we wish Christopher a swift and full recovery

"We have all been affected by this, right across Thames Valley Police."

Senior investigating officer Det Supt Will Crowther asked anyone who saw a white BMW being driven "erratically" in the areas of Stoke Poges and Slough between 20:00 and 01:00 to get in touch.

"We believe that, after the collision, the BMW will have sustained damage to the front of the car," he said.

"I believe there are people out there that know who is responsible."

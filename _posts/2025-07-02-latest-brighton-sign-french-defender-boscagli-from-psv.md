Let's dive into the details: Along with two Eredivisie titles, Olivier Boscagli won the KNVB Cup in 2023 and the Johan Cruyff Shield twice with PSV.

Brighton have signed French defender Olivier Boscagli following his departure from PSV Eindhoven.

The 27-year-old, who can play as left-back or centre-back, has signed a five-year contract with the south-coast club.

"We're delighted to welcome Olivier to Brighton. He has got a lot of experience with PSV and we like his versatility," said head coach Fabian Hurzeler.

"He can play in several positions and we feel it is important to have these players in our squad. We are looking forward to working with him.

PSV announced Boscagli would be leaving on a free transfer last month, having won successive league titles in his last two seasons with Eindhoven.

The former France Under-21 international made 204 appearances for PSV after joining from Nice in 2019.

Boscagli joins forward Charalampos Kostoulas, wingers Tommy Watson and Yoon Doyoung and defender Diego Coppola in the summer arrivals at Brighton, who finished eighth in the Premier League last season.

But the Seagulls have had departures, with forward Joao Pedro joining Chelsea and Argentine full-back Valentin Barco moving to Strasbourg earlier on Wednesday.

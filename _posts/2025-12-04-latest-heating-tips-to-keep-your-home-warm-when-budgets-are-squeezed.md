Here’s what you need to know: Many parts have seen temperatures drop to or below freezing this winter. 

What is the best way to heat your home and keep yourself safe and well during periods of cold weather? 

Keeping warm over the winter months can help to prevent colds, flu and more serious health problems such as heart attacks, strokes, pneumonia and depression, according to the NHS.

Pensioners, children under the age of five, people with health conditions and those who are pregnant are most at risk.

Wearing multiple layers of clothing - including thick socks and fingerless gloves - can help keep you warm if you are not moving. 

Family, friends and neighbours can play their part by ensuring anyone who is more vulnerable is well stocked up with food and necessary medicines, and that they can safely get in and out of their property by keeping any steps or paths clear of snow or ice. 

Many charities and councils run free warm hubs in locations such as libraries and other community spaces. 

Check whether there are any quick fixes to make sure you are not wasting energy or heat. 

That could include turning off radiators in unused rooms, switching off lights when they are not needed, and not leaving electrical appliances on standby.

Curtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk.

Limit heat loss by using draught excluders to block gaps under doors or around windows. You can add metal, plastic or adhesive foam strips to fill any gaps. 

You can cover external keyholes and add a flap or brush to your letterbox, or hang a door curtain. You can put a chimney draught excluder inside any unused fireplaces, or make your own by filling a black bag with scrunched up paper. 

The Energy Saving Trust points out that internal doors should not be draught-proofed to allow the proper circulation of air throughout a property. 

Rugs can cover gaps between floorboards, and warm hard floors. 

Experts are divided on whether it is more efficient to keep your heating on permanently at a lower temperature or switch it on and off as required. 

Generally, using a thermostat to keep the room temperature between 18C and 21C is ideal for most. However, turning it down even one degree can save money, as can switching off radiators in unoccupied rooms. 

Older people and those with health conditions which limit their mobility are not advised to let temperatures drop below 18C in rooms they use regularly.

Your heating system may have a timer function which lets you programme particular temperatures at different times of the day. Some wireless thermostats are connected to the internet and can be turned on remotely. 

Turning down your combi boiler's flow temperature can help the system run more efficiently, and save money. 

Make sure radiators are not blocked by curtains or furniture. Consider fitting reflector panels to those on external walls. 

If you are staying in one room for a long time, you may want to use a portable electric heater instead of turning on your central heating system. 

They should be plugged directly into a mains socket, placed on a flat surface, and be at least 3ft (1m) away from anything flammable such as curtains or furniture. 

Using gas heaters carries the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, so you should ensure you have a working carbon monoxide alarm in the same room.

You can also use electric blankets or heated throws on a timer function to ensure they don't overheat. 

Experts argue it is essential to eat and drink properly during periods of cold weather. Keep moving as much as you can between meals.  

Age UK recommends at least one hot meal a day such as soup or stew, and regular hot drinks like tea. 

Tinned soups, fruit and vegetables can be cheaper than fresh produce. 

You may be able to get support from your local food bank, although you might need to be referred first. Local community organisations can often arrange this.

Don't overfill your kettle: only boil what you need. Batch cooking and freezing meal portions can also save money. Microwaves and air fryers can be cheaper to run than gas or electric ovens. 

Don't run your dishwasher unless it is full, and choose an eco-setting if you can. 

If your energy supplier offers discounts for off-peak use, try to use washing machines and other large appliances during the cheaper period. 

Wash clothes at 30C, not 40C.

Limit your shower time to four minutes. Use a timer or make a playlist of four-minute songs. 

If you are struggling financially, then ask your energy supplier for help.

Firms must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if necessary. Most also provide hardship grants.

Anyone on a prepayment meter who can't afford to top up can ask for a fuel voucher from their energy provider, or through their council.

Local authorities in England may also be able to provide cost-of-living assistance through the household support fund. You can find your local council here.

Under the Warm Home Discount scheme, anyone on means-tested benefits in Great Britain will get £150 taken off their bills.

About nine million pensioners will also get the Winter Fuel Payment in 2025/2026, worth £200 or £300, after a government U-turn over eligibility.

During an extended period of sub-zero temperatures, cold weather payments are made to eligible households in qualifying postcodes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is a separate winter heating payment in Scotland.

Here’s what you need to know: Liane Lippert claimed her first stage win for a year at the Women's Giro d'Italia

Germany's Liane Lippert won stage six of the Women's Giro d'Italia with her Movistar team-mate Marlen Reusser holding on to the overall lead.

The 27-year-old was part of a two-rider breakaway inside the last 10km of the 145km stage to Terre Roveresche and got the better of Fenix-Deceuninck's Pauliena Rooijakkers in a sprint to the line.

It clinched a first stage victory for Lippert since stage six of last year's Giro.

"Super happy! I had a super good day today. The team was on fire and everyone really believed in me," Lippert said.

"It's a long process and I'm super happy to finally have a win, the first one of the season."

Lidl-Trek's Shirin van Anrooij finished third, 46 seconds behind Lippert.

Meanwhile, Reusser, of Switzerland, finished in the peloton to keep the pink jersey and maintain a 16-second lead over defending champion Italian Elisa Longo Borghini.

Dutch rider Rooijakkers is up to fourth after her second-place finish.

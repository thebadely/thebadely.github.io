It has been recently reported that The Sunday Telegraph says a government-backed report to be published on Tuesday will conclude that anti-Semitism has become normalised in middle-class Britain.

It's been co-authored by Lord Mann, the government's adviser on the issue, and the former defence secretary, Dame Penny Mordaunt.

They have written an article for the paper saying they were "stunned into silence" by the evidence they heard.

The paper says their report found antisemitism to be "pervasive" in the NHS, at universities and in the arts - and will recommend that Judaism be recognised as an ethnicity.

The Sunday Times says negotiations about a migrant return deal with Iraq are in their final stages. The paper says it could be announced by the end of the summer.

The Sunday Express instead focuses on the deal already reached with France.

It quotes critics who warn that it "won't stop a single boat" - but the paper says the prime minister has hit back that agreements can "stop illegal migration in its tracks".

The Sun reports that the government is working on plans for digital ID cards which would be given only to immigrants.

The Sunday Mirror says car manufacturers are to get a Â£2.5bn boost to help them transition to making electric vehicles.

The Sunday Telegraph also reports on a boost for electric, saying the government is to announce grants to help drivers cover the upfront cost of a new vehicle, as well as more cash for charging points.

Senior aides to King Charles and the Duke of Sussex have held a secret peace summit, according to the Mail on Sunday.

The paper has photos of a meeting between advisers at a private members' club in London which is said to "champion international friendship".

The Mail calls the talks "the first significant move towards resolving a rancorous family feud".

A source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex declined to comment on the meeting.

The Princess of Wales's appearance at Wimbledon for the women's singles final is pictured on many of the front pages.

"Kate aces it" is the headline in the Sunday Mirror. 

According to the Telegraph, Catherine received a standing ovation from the crowd. It says she was "centre stage on centre court". 

The Mail says she appeared emotional as she made her most high-profile public appearance this year. 

It recounts how eight-year-old Lydia Lowe, who is recovering from a brain injury, met Catherine before the match and advised her "don't be nervous - take deep breaths".

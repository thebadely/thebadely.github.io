Let's dive into the details: The owners of an award-winning artisan chocolate business say increased prices and staffing costs have forced them to close their cafe. 

Holly and Sam Garner said Hollychocs, in Devizes, Wiltshire, will shut the Beanery Cafe in August after two years of business.

"Every time we buy ingredients or packaging, the costs go up and on top of the increased costs with staffing, it's just unsustainable for us to continue," Ms Garner said, citing the recent increase in National Insurance contributions as part of the problem.

A government spokesperson said it was "disappointed whenever any business has to close" and that officials are "taking bold action to back small businesses".

Ms Garner said: "At the moment, everyone has less disposable income – we're finding in the cafe that more and more people are sharing things rather than having something each, and that makes it really hard to keep the business profitable."

"We've tried everything – from constantly creating new menu offerings, to introducing special offers," she added. 

Government figures show that chocolate prices have risen by 17.7% in the year to May – far higher than rate of inflation for all food.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has just visited Wiltshire to announce a plan to help small businesses, but this has come too late for the cafe, and Ms Garner is doubtful whether it would have helped.

She said that one of the saddest parts about closing the cafe is not being able to provide customers with treats for special occasions.

She hopes that remodelling the business will enable her to continue.

"We're having to look at how to work smarter to make the most of our time and keep our costs where they are by taking less time to make our products," she said.

"We're trying to strengthen the business now by offering click and collect and holding chocolate experiences and masterclasses.

"I'm really optimistic, and we're just hoping that everyone will continue to support us."

The government spokesperson said: "Our brand new small business plan is giving owners the backing they need, including tailored support, access to finance and tough action on late payments.

"We have also taken 865,000 small businesses out of paying employer National Insurance through increasing the employment allowance [the amount employers can claim back from their NI bill]."

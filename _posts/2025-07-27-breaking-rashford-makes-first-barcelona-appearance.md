Let's dive into the details: Marcus Rashford will soon become the first English player to feature for Barcelona's first team in a competitive game since Gary Lineker in the 1980s

Marcus Rashford played 33 minutes on his first Barcelona appearance in their 3-1 friendly win over Japanese side Vissel Kobe.

The England forward, who has joined the Spanish champions on a season-long loan from Manchester United, came on at half-time in one of 11 changes.

But the 27-year-old, whose move can be made permanent for Â£30.3m next summer, was then replaced in the 78th minute by teenager Dro Fernandez, who scored Barcelona's third goal.

Defender Eric Garcia netted the opener in the 33rd minute, before Taisei Miyashiro equalised for hosts Vissel Kobe three minutes before the break.

Swedish forward Roony Bardghji - a summer signing from Copenhagen - put Barca back in front, before 17-year-old Dro sealed the success in the 87th minute.

The match had been called off earlier in the week with Barcelona blaming "serious contractual breaches" by the promoter - but those issues were sorted for the game to go ahead.

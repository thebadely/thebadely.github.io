It has been recently reported that State Man won the Champion Hurdle at the Punchestown Festival as Constitution Hill came home in fifth place. 

Despite falls in consecutive races at Cheltenham and Aintree, Constitution Hill was an 8-13 favourite to get back to winning ways at Punchestown. 

However it was State Man, who also fell at Cheltenham, who stormed to victory with Paul Townend on home soil, while eight-time Grade One winner Constitution Hill drifted away to a fifth-place finish. 

It was a third Champion Hurdle victory at the festival for the Willie Mullins-trained horse, who came home ahead of Cheltenham winner Golden Ace. 

"It's the performance we always thought he had in him," Mullins said about State Man on RTE.

"In fairness to Constitution Hill, I don't think he turned up on the day. It's very hard to travel from England after having two falls and things just didn't go right for him.

"Our fella has run his true race and that's been a constant thing in his racing life, he always turns up and runs his race. It was a huge performance."

Townend and Mullins combined to win the Grade One Novice Hurdle on Final Demand, ahead of Lovely Hurling and Tripoli Flyer.

Fountain House won the opening race of the day in the Hunters' Chase, while Its On The Line came home in the Champion Hunters' Chase.

Sea Music won the Novice Handicap Chase, Gordon Elliott's Casheldale Lad claimed the Novice Hurdle and Soldier In Milan won the Flat Race in the final outing of the day.

The final day of the festival takes place on Saturday.

According to new developments, Stiller (left) and Edvardsen clashed during Thursday's Europa League game 

Go Ahead Eagles striker Victor Edvardsen has been fined for mocking the appearance of an opponent born with a cleft lip.

Edvardsen made gestures about Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller's nose during their Europa League match on Thursday.

A cleft lip, which can also affect the shape of the nose, occurs when parts of the baby's face do not join together properly during development in the womb.

Edvardsen, who said he went into the Stuttgart dressing room after the game to apologise to Germany international Stiller, has been fined 500 euros (Â£432) by Go Ahead Eagles, who will donate the money to their social services fund.

"I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for my behaviour," said 29-year-old Edvardsen, who has one cap for Sweden.

"Things were said and done between us that have no place on a football pitch. I'm a role model and I have to act accordingly."

Go Ahead Eagles general manager Jan Willem van Dop said: "As a club, we are completely dissatisfied with Victor's behavior and distance ourselves from it. 

"It's good that he apologised afterwards, but it remains a stain on the evening."

German side Stuttgart secured a 4-0 win away at Go Ahead Eagles in the Netherlands.

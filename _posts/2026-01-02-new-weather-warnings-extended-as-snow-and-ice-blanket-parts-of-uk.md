Let's dive into the details: Snow and ice warnings have been issued for much of the UK over the weekend and beyond.

Amber snow warnings are in effect for Scotland from midday Friday until noon on Saturday. Yellow snow and ice warnings are in place across the south-west, north-west and east coast of England, and Wales and Northern Ireland, until Monday.

Heavy snowfall has already covered parts of Scotland, with the Met Office predicting up to 40cm (15in) there and 5cm across England and Wales.

Travel delays and cancellations, disruption on the roads and power cuts are expected.

Large parts of England, Wales and Scotland have started 2026 with very chilly conditions, as cold Arctic air forces temperatures across the UK to plummet. 

On Friday night, the Met Office expects sub-zero temperatures to blanket the country, including minimum temperatures of -6C to -8C across much of Scotland, and -4C to -5C in rural areas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

With temperatures only scraping above zero across the UK on Saturday, snow showers are forecast in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the south-west and east coast of England, while winter sunshine is expected elsewhere.

The more serious Met Office amber warning in Scotland, which describes "disruptive snow" causing potential delays to rail and air travel and some dangerous conditions, runs until 12:00 on Saturday.

Areas which will likely be affected by "blizzard conditions" include, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Grampian, Aberdeenshire, Moray and parts of the Highlands. These areas could see power cuts and vehicles risk being stranded, the Met Office warned.

With names like Sir Andy Flurry, Robert Brrrns, and Plougher O'Scotland, the Scottish gritter and snowplough fleet is out in force across the nation's road network.

Yellow alerts for snow and ice continue on Sunday and Monday across many of the areas of the UK covered earlier in the weekend, with the last ending on Monday afternoon.

A full list of affected areas is available from the forecaster.

Some areas of Scotland have already experienced disruption: ScotRail has cancelled some rail services and there have been issues on the roads and ferries.

Meanwhile, multiple crashes were reported in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, National Highways said, with motorists urged to seek alternative routes were possible.

People are being urged to plan routes carefully and to pack essentials in your car in the event of delays. Key items to bring include warm clothing, water, a blanket and ice-scraper.

Met Office forecaster Neil Armstrong predicts the cold spell "could last well into next week" and "wintry hazards will continue with more weather warnings likely".

Health Secretary Wes Streeting has warned the "bitingly cold snap" will put extra pressure on NHS hospitals and has urged people to only attend A&E for emergencies. 

The predicted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions, according to the UK Health Security Agency.

There is also an increased risk of falls due to the icy weather.

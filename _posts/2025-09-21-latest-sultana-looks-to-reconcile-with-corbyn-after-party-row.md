According to new developments, Former Labour MP Zarah Sultana has said she is "determined to reconcile and move forward" after divisions emerged over the formation of a new left-wing political party with Jeremy Corbyn. 

The Coventry South MP also said she will no longer be pursuing legal action against Corbyn and others behind the party, known for now as Your Party.

It comes after Sultana said on Friday that she had instructed defamation lawyers over what she said were "baseless attacks" on her character.

Corbyn has been approached for comment. Like Sultana, he is understood to want the party's inaugural conference still to go ahead as planned in November.

In a statement posted on X, Sultana said it was a "regrettable situation" and she understood "people are feeling demoralised" but that she was confident the party's conference would go ahead.

"I am engaged in ongoing discussions with Jeremy, for whom, like all socialists of my generation, I have nothing but respect," she said.

"We will find a way to continue in a unified way centring the grassroots of our movement."

Efforts to try and mediate between the pair began on Friday.

It comes days after Sultana accused former Labour leader Corbyn of overseeing a "sexist boys' club" and alleged she had been "sidelined" by other members of the new party.

The split emerged after an email was sent to supporters inviting them to sign up for a £5 monthly or £55 annual membership. Sultana promoted the sign-up on social media, but Corbyn later said the emails were "unauthorised" and should be ignored.

On Friday, Sultana said she had instructed defamation lawyers after being "the subject of a number of false and defamatory statements" following the launch of the membership system which she said more than 20,000 people had signed up to.

"Unfortunately I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys' club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely," she added.

Islington North MP Corbyn's statement dismissing the email and saying any direct debits should be "immediately cancelled" was signed by Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed and Shockat Adam - four independent MPs involved in founding the party - with Sultana's name missing from the list.

The new party has been beset by issues since it was announced in July.

Corbyn allies have said they are "disappointed" at the deep divisions that have emerged over the party's formation.

Some said they believe Sultana was attempting to mount a leadership bid by signing people up. Corbyn has not agreed to co-leadership, although he has not ruled it out.

Sultana insisted the launch of the membership portal was "in line with the road map sent out to members", with funds to be held by a company set up by the party to safeguard money until its conference in November.

Your Party group sent the case to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the data protection law watchdog, over suspected misuse of supporters' details.

The pair previously disagreed over the name of the party, with Sultana maintaining it would not be called Your Party and hinting she favoured The Left Party, while Corbyn indicated the name could stay.

The final decision is to be put to a vote by supporters.

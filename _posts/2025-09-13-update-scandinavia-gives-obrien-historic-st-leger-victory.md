Here’s what you need to know: Scandinavia earned trainer Aidan O'Brien his ninth winner in the St Leger

Aidan O'Brien became the first trainer in modern history to claim three consecutive winners of the St Leger as Scandinavia clinched victory by a neck. 

Jockey Tom Marquand steered home the 2-1 favourite in a thrilling finish, holding off a late charge for 14-1 chance Rahiebb on the line. 

O'Brien's Stay True was third while Derby winner Lambourn, the Irish trainer's final horse home in the seven-strong field, faded to finish fourth.

For Marquand it was a sweet triumph in front of a packed crowd at Doncaster after his previous win in 2020 came during Covid restrictions.

"It's nice winning a St Leger with a few people here as well - it was a bit quiet last time," Marquand told ITV Sport after helping clinch a ninth winner in total for O'Brien in the fifth and final Classic of the Flat season.

Scandinavia's latest St Leger victory for O'Brien follows Janâ¯Brueghel last year and Continuous in 2023.

Only four trainers have completed three consecutive victories in the race's 249-year history, with St Leger's most successful trainer, John Scott, the last to do it, claiming four in a row between 1838 and 1841. 

Lambourn had been heavily backed in the run-up to the world's oldest Classic as the first Derby winner to take part in the St Leger since Camelot in 2012. 

The 11-4 second favourite had followed up the Derby win by clinching the Irish Derby, but it was Scandanavia who lived up to the billing after back-to-back wins at the Bahrain Trophy and Goodwood in his past two starts.

"He has got the most beautiful temperament," added Marquand. 

"He is just so straightforward and was so tough there. The [soft] ground was hard work but he fended them all off.

"He's an extra-special horse and one I am privileged to sit on today." 

O'Brien's day was capped by a record-extending 13th victory in the Irish Champion Stakes, as 2-1 favourite Delacroix produced an emphatic performance to come home three quarters of a length ahead of Anmaat (4-1) at Leopardstown.

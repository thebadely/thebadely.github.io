Let's dive into the details: Salford Red Devils are bottom of Super League after 21 defeats from 24 games this season

A winding-up petition filed against troubled Super League side Salford Red Devils has been adjourned for a second time.

The petition was initially adjourned in June after the club said they were confident of attaining a bridging loan in order to pay a tax bill to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

It has been a rocky season for the club both on and off the field, with a mass player exodus, late wage payments and heavy defeats in 2025 contributing to them sitting bottom of the Super League table.

"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the courts for granting a further adjournment," a club statement said., external

"This positive outcome is a vital step forward and allows Salford Red Devils to complete the remainder of our fixtures this season. It reflects the resilience of the club and the ongoing efforts taking place behind the scenes to secure its long-term future.

"We also want to acknowledge the continued support from everyone connected to the club. Your backing - whether in the stands, in the community, or beyond - remains an important part of what keeps Salford moving forward."

Salford's fortunes are in stark contrast to an impressive 2024 campaign, during which boss Paul Rowley steered them to a fourth-placed finish and a play-off spot.

Financial troubles during the off-season led to the club requesting an advance on their 2025 distribution payments, while a consortium led by Swiss businessman Dario Berta completed a takeover of the Red Devils on the eve of the 2025 season.

Things have gradually got worse for the club this term, however, with chief executive Chris Irwin resigning less than three months into the job while Salford City Council also pulled out of negotiations with the Red Devils over the club's attempt to buy their Salford Community Stadium home in May.

A sustainability cap imposed on the club by the Rugby Football League affected team selection, leading to the Red Devils fielding youthful sides and being on the receiving end of a record 82-0 defeat by St Helens at the start of the season.

Since their last adjournment, Salford's owners said the club would not close despite its financial troubles while chief operating officer Claire Bradbury quit her role after she alleged the club's ownership suggested she "sleep with someone at the Rugby Football League" to ease their situation.

Salford's Super League game against Wakefield was later called off because of "significant" welfare concerns, with the club having just two senior players available - leading to a fan protest.

On 25 August, the club's owners gave assurances to Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Mayor of Salford Paul Dennett assurances that they would be able to finish the season.

Meanwhile, assistant coach Kurt Haggerty, who was meant to take over as head coach from Rowley for 2026, left the club earlier this week due to their perilous position.

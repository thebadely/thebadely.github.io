Here’s what you need to know: A cafe owner says she has suffered sleepless nights due to an energy supplier's "bullying tactics" over a disputed bill. 

Samantha Panton said Roasters, one of Tamworth's oldest family firms, could have been "put out of business" if E.On followed through on threats to take her to court and disconnect her.

The 55-year-old believes bosses have been wrongly chasing her for £24,000 due to a technical issue with her electricity metres, the first of which was installed in 2017.

The company told the BBC it stood by its calculation but was committed to helping the restaurant manage its balance. 

Ms Panton claimed E.On debt collectors came to her cafe in early 2024, while the shop was "full of customers and staff", demanding the bill was paid within a week. 

"They had the power to put us out of business after 33 years," she said. 

"I can't begin to tell you the stress, the upset [and] the embarrassment that caused us.

"My business is everything to me and my family, but to them it is nothing. If you owe them money their tactics are horrible."

The threat of court action receded when the case was taken up by Tamworth MP Sarah Edwards in May last year. 

Ms Edwards told a parliamentary committee she was "frankly disgusted" by the way Roasters had been treated, urging the energy ombudsman to dole out more severe fines for incorrect billing. 

"Without my letter [to the CEO] to stop, E.On would have bankrupted this business and 10 of my constituents would have lost their jobs," Ms Edwards said.

But Ms Panton said the issue was still not fully resolved, with an accountant believing her account could even be in credit.

E.On insisted the Energy Ombudsman had concluded the billing on the account was valid and there was no technical issue with Ms Panton's meter. 

"We have made repeated attempts to engage with Ms Panton but as we've received limited response we've been unable to move forward," a statement read.

"We remain committed to setting up a suitable repayment plan to help manage her ongoing usage and outstanding balance."

Paul Chrimes, who is registered as blind, believes it isn't just small businesses having problems with E.On. 

The professional piano tuner has been locked in dispute with the supplier for five years, accusing the company of billing his Wolverhampton home based on "guesstimates" rather than actual metre readings.  

"It's just utterly ridiculous," he said. "I don't think it is acceptable to treat anybody in this sort of way." 

The 71-year-old claimed responses to his complaints were sent in small print, something that had left him "irritated and infuriated". 

The pensioner has stopped paying his bill because he says he's not being charged properly and can't engage with the company. 

E.On said there was nothing to suggest he had been overcharged, and it would support him as a vulnerable customer. 

"We have taken steps to ensure that Mr Chrimes is receiving large print letters and have reminded him of the importance of monthly meter readings to avoid estimated bills," the firm said.  

Dr David Toke, a Solihull-based energy expert, said he believed companies were putting profit before people. 

He has advocated for public ownership of the retail electricity supply, claiming some firms have "no interest" in helping those being billed incorrectly. 

"They don't dedicate enough staff to deal with that sort of thing," he said. "There's no profits in it for them for doing that. 

"We need a rethink of the companies involved so we can get a proper system that will involve ordinary people." 

E.On has previously been in trouble over separate billing issues with pre-payment metres. 

In December, it was revealed it would have to pay millions in compensation after failing to pay certain account credit back to vulnerable customers between February 2021 and September 2023.

When asked for a comment on the issues discussed in this article, the company said its "energy specialists are ready and able to assist customers".

It added this included "providing advice on payment and financial arrangements, smart meter installs or tariff switches to ensure their energy account is set up to suit their circumstances".

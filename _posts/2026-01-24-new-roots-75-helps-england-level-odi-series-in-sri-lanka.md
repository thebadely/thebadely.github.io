Scorecard

Joe Root made a measured 75 as England pulled off a comfortable run chase to beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in the second one-day international to square the three-match series.

Sri Lanka posted a relatively modest 219 after England's spinners had turned the screw on a surface which offered appreciable turn.

Charith Asalanka top-scored for Sri Lanka, striking just one boundary in his 64-ball 45, while Dhananjaya de Silva chipped in with 40 on a day where strike-rates were largely an afterthought.

Veteran leg-spinner Adil Rashid bowled the most impressively for England as he finished with economical figures of 2-34 from his 10 overs while Root's two overs at the end yielded 2-13.

Root's patience at the crease, deft footwork and reading of spin made him the linchpin of England's chase and once he settled in, Sri Lanka found it difficult to know where to bowl to him.

England's all-time leading Test run-scorer shared stands of 68 with Ben Duckett, who made 39, and 81 with fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook which broke the back of the reply.

Root's innings had been chanceless until a yorker from Asitha Fernando hit him on the pad as he attempted to flick the ball off his toes.

He reviewed the decision to give him out lbw, but the ball-tracking technology came down in Sri Lanka's favour and he was out on umpire's call.

That left Brook and Jos Buttler to get the 42 runs required and nerves probably jangled when the England skipper misjudged a sweep on 42 and was lbw to Jeffrey Vandersay.

But Buttler (33* off 21 balls) put his foot on the accelerator to get England over the line with 22 balls to spare to wrap up their first win in 12 ODIs away from home.

Brook criticises 'worst ever' pitch after ODI win

England level ODI series against Sri Lanka - as it happened

With opener Zak Crawley absent with a knee injury, England experimented with Rehan Ahmed at the top of the order.

It was not without precedent in domestic cricket. In his sole T20 innings in the role he made 49 runs off 32 balls, while his first-class record is reasonable. In four innings, he has 203 runs at an average of 67.7 with one century and one half-century.

Ahmed looked relatively composed in Colombo but whether 13 off 18 balls has done enough to persuade England coach Brendon McCullum it is an experiment worth persisting with remains to be seen.

Duckett still looked like a man trying to find his way back into form during an unconvincing innings off 52 balls.

But it was Root, like that favoured old pair of slippers or warm winter jumper, who provided the reassuring comfort in England's middle order as he crafted a peerless knock.

There were some fluent strokes to the boundary for four but he eschewed the flamboyant during a more a familiar tale of accumulation - just as it has been for most of his career.

Over the course of this innings, Root went past 3,500 runs in singles in ODI cricket. His non-boundary strike-rate of 59.95 is actually the best for any batter in ODI history.

On this metric, Root sits above two ODI greats in AB de Villiers (59.23) and Virat Kohli (58.10). 

Those low-risk dabs and flicks, nudges and nurdles, were valuable to England on a pitch which required a batter to play the percentages.

Root once again shows no signs of stopping. Appreciate him while he's doing his thing.

Most of the spin from England during the Ashes came via their off-the-field briefings as they attempted to massage the narrative of a winter tour of discontent.

On a pitch which ragged at the R Premadasa Stadium, however, it was the degrees of turn offered by the ball which provided the focus on this occasion.

In ODIs since the start of 2024, this stadium has seen an average turn of 2.93 degrees. In the 23 bowling innings here in this timeframe, England's degree of turn today was the fourth-most at this venue.

England managed 3.15 degrees of spin in the first ODI but it was 3.62 here - a 15% increase - which Brook, to his credit, astutely realised was the best way to winkle wickets.

There were 40.3 overs bowled by spinners which was the most by any England bowling attack in an ODI.  The previous record was 36 overs, back in March 1985 in a 50-over match against Pakistan in Sharjah.

It was also the first time in an ODI England have used six different spinners. 

Rashid's leg-breaks were the most masterful as he finished with an economy of 3.40 claiming the key top-order wickets of Sri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka and captain Asalanka.

But he was well supported by a phalanx of twirlers - offies from Will Jacks and Root, leggies from Ahmed plus Jacob Bethell's left-arm orthodox.

Five different spinners picked up a wicket -  the joint-most in an ODI innings by a team and first by England.

The seven wickets which fell to spin was the second most by an England attack in an ODI, bettered only by eight against West Indies at North Sound in 2014.

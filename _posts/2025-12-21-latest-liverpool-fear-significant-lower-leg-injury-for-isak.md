According to new developments, Alexander Isak scored 27 goals for Newcastle in all competitions in 2024-25

Liverpool fear Alexander Isak has sustained a significant lower leg injury after the striker was forced off in Saturday's 2-1 win over Tottenham.

The Swede came off the bench to break the deadlock for Arne Slot's side, but was challenged by Micky van de Ven just after he got his shot away, and was ultimately unable to continue.

The 26-year-old, who joined Liverpool from Newcastle in a record Premier League Â£125m deal in September, went for MRI scans on Sunday to determine the extent of the damage.

It is understood those scans will determine an exact timeframe on how long Isak will be sidelined.

Liverpool boss Slot is next due to speak at a news conference on Tuesday.

Asked about the injury on Saturday, he said: "We'll have to wait and see.

"But if a player scores and then gets injured and doesn't try to come back on the pitch, that's usually not a good thing."

Isak, who scored only his second Premier League goal of the season on Saturday in 10 appearances, has struggled since arriving at Anfield.

Earlier this summer, he was left out of the Newcastle squad for their pre-season tour of Asia with what the club described as a "minor thigh injury", while it was understood he wanted to explore a move away.

Isak then trained alone at his former club Real Sociedad before joining Liverpool on deadline day.

Without a proper pre-season, he arrived short of match fitness and has started just 10 times in all competitions.

Liverpool are also without Mohamed Salah, who is with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations, and the injured Cody Gakpo.

Fellow forward Hugo Ekitike, who joined in the summer from Eintracht Frankfurt, was also on target at Spurs and expected to continue to lead the line for the Reds.

The 23-year-old Frenchman has scored 11 times this term, with five in the last three league games a factor in Isak starting on the bench.

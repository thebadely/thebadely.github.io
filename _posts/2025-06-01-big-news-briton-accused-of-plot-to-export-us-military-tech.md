Experts revealed that A British man has been indicted in the US for allegedly trying to smuggle "sensitive American military technology" to China, including missiles, air defence radar and drones.

John Miller, 63, and a Chinese man, Cui Guanghai, are wanted by the FBI on charges relating to conspiracy to commit interstate stalking and conspiracy, smuggling and violations of the Arms Control Act.

Mr Miller, a permanent US resident, and Mr Cui, 43, were both arrested in Serbia. They remain there and could now face extradition to the US.

The Foreign Office has confirmed it is providing consular assistance to a British national following his arrest in April and it is "in touch with the local authorities and his family".

Court documents suggest the two men discussed ways of exporting a device that could be used for encryption and decryption. They are alleged to have paid a $10,000 (£7,430) deposit for the equipment.

Mr Miller and Mr Cui are also accused of trying to "harass" an anti-Chinese government protester, which included installing a tracking device on their car and slashing their tires.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused the pair of a "blatant assault" on US national security and its democratic values.

He added: "This Justice Department will not tolerate foreign repression on US soil, nor will we allow hostile nations to infiltrate or exploit our defence systems."

If found guilty, Mr Miller could face up to 20 years in prison for violation of the Arms Export Control Act, and 10 years for smuggling.

Court documents detail how the men allegedly solicited the procurement of US defence articles, including missiles, air defence radar, drones and cryptographic devices for unlawful export to China.

Mr Cui and Mr Miller are said to have discussed with two individuals - identified as "Individual 5" and "Individual 6" in court documents - how to export a cryptographic device from the US to China.

Items the men allegedly discussed using to smuggle the technology include small electronics, a blender and a motor starter. 

The indictment also alleges the pair enlisted two individuals in the US to carry out a plot that would have prevented a victim from protesting against Chinese President Xi Jinping's attendance at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit held in Los Angeles in November 2023.

Mr Miller and Mr Cui were unaware that those two individuals - identified in court documents as "Individual 1" and "Individual 2" - were acting at the direction of the FBI. 

"The indictment alleges that Chinese foreign actors targeted a victim in our nation because he criticised the Chinese government and its president," said US Attorney Bill Essayli for the Central District of California. 

"My office will continue to use all legal methods available to hold accountable foreign nationals engaging in criminal activity on our soil."

A similar scheme allegedly played out in the spring of 2025, when the alleged victim announced in a public video feed that he planned to unveil two new artistic statues that depicted Xi and his wife. 

Mr Cui and Mr Miller paid two other individuals - identified in court documents as "Individual 3" and "Individual 4" - to try and dissuade the alleged victim from sharing his online display of statues. 

Those individuals were paid $36,000 (£26,745), but the indictment notes that those two people were also affiliated with and acting at the direction of the FBI.

The two men remain in Serbia and the US is co-ordinating with Serbian officials regarding their pending extraditions.

"An indictment is merely an allegation," the US Attorney's Office of the Central District of California said in a statement. "All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."

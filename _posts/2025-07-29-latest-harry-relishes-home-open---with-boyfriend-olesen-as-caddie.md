It has been recently reported that Darcey Harry came second at qualifying school last December to secure her place on the Ladies European Tour

AIG Women's Open

Venue: Royal Porthcawl, Wales Date: 31 July - 3 August

Darcey Harry was at Royal Portrush earlier this month, cheering on boyfriend Jacob Skov Olesen as he shared the lead after round one of the men's Open Championship.

This week it will be Olesen in the supporting role as rising Welsh golf star Harry makes her AIG Women's Open debut at Royal Porthcawl.

But Olesen will not be backing Harry, 22, from behind the ropes.

The Dane is to caddie for his partner, just as he did when the Ladies European Tour (LET) rookie claimed a memorable victory at Belgium's Hulencourt Women's Open in June.

"Originally I was going to caddie for myself for a little bit, but then my boyfriend had an off-week that week [in Belgium] so I said 'ooh you can come and push my bag'," Harry explains.

"The first time he caddied for me we won, so that was a really nice moment to share with him.

"I think I learned a lot from him being on my bag. I don't think I would have been able to do it without him."

The hope is that Olesen's presence will bring more success as Harry plays just the second major of her fledgling career this week at the course she calls home.

Like Harry, Olesen is in his rookie year on tour having turned professional after coming through qualifying school.

He made quite a splash at the Open, shooting 67 on the first day to reach the top of the leaderboard.

Though he fell away in round two, Olesen made the cut and ended up 68th, which was a creditable return in what was just the second major of the 26-year-old's career.

Now it is Harry preparing for her second major appearance having debuted at the Evian Championship earlier this month.

She missed the cut in France in what was her first time competing alongside the best players women's golf has to offer.

But Harry is back home in positive mood after an encouraging display at last week's Scottish Open, where she finished tied-38th in what was another high-class field.

"I am so excited," Harry says.

"I just can't really believe that I am going to be playing [in the Women's Open at Porthcawl]. I can't really put into words how much I am looking forward to it."

A gap in Olesen's schedule saw him parachuted in to carry Harry's bag in Belgium, when a final round of 68 saw her win by three shots â and book her place in Porthcawl in the process.

There was further success for the Harry-Olesen combination at the Czech Ladies Open the following week, where Harry finished tied-fourth.

Harry says Olesen's "knowledge" of different shots has given her "such an advantage" when they have worked together.

The truth is that this week at least, she will need little help when it comes to mapping her way around the course.

Harry has been a member at Royal Porthcawl since she was in her mid-teens and has played the links hundreds of times.

"I wouldn't say there will be a huge advantage, but I will know some of the lines and I'll know where not to go," she says.

"But we are talking about the world's best coming to play here, so they will learn the course in one or two days."

The Hulencourt Women's Open was just the eighth Ladies European Tour event of Darcey Harry's career 

Harry has never played Royal Porthcawl with fairways and greens lined with the sort of crowds expected on the south Wales coastline this week.

Welsh golf fans are crying out for some success in either the women's or men's games, and there are high hopes for Harry given her impressive start to life on the LET.

Harry, Wales' highest-ranked golfer at 221st in the world, will stay at home in Dinas Powys this week, and is looking forward to "some food cooked by mum and dad and having all my washing done".

While she plans to "give a wave" to the many friends and family members who are likely to be in the galleries this week, Harry says focus will be key to her prospects of competing.

"I have got to treat it like every other week, try to be in my own zone and try not to get distracted by other things," says Harry.

"There will be a lot of concentration because there will be a lot of nerves.

"I definitely think if I play my best golf, then I will have a chance to hopefully climb up the leaderboard."

'There's no holes in his game' - Henman on 'relentless' Djokovic

Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic said he is "blessed" to have sealed his 100th victory at Wimbledon with a statement third-round win over compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic.

Serb Djokovic was in no mood to delay his near-fated century at the All England Club and secured the 6-3 6-0 6-4 victory in just one hour and 50 minutes.

It is a feat achieved in singles only by nine-time women's winner Martina Navratilova and eight-time champion Roger Federer, who holds the men's record with 105.

If Djokovic wins the trophy at the end of the fortnight, he will still be one shy of Federer's mark.

But it would land him an even bigger accomplishment - the record 25th Grand Slam title he has been chasing since last winning a major at the 2023 US Open.

"Wimbledon is a favourite and a dream tournament of not just myself but the majority of players," he said.

"Growing up, most kids dream of winning here and I've been blessed to do that many times here. Any history I make in my favourite tournament... I'm blessed."

Djokovic celebrated the milestone by performing a 'pumping' dance which has become a tradition between him and his children after each win this tournament.

He demonstrated the dance with his daughter - who was sitting in his coaching box - during his on-court speech after the match.

The 38-year-old, seeded sixth, will take on Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur in the fourth round.

As Centre Court's Royal Box hosted 'Sporting Saturday' with a plethora of stars in attendance, it was perhaps fitting that Djokovic continued his pursuit of a record-breaking 25th major title in such devastating fashion.

Djokovic was brimming with confidence after his second-round victory over Briton Dan Evans, saying he played "almost flawless tennis" with his serve in particular impressing.

It was the serve that was once again the focal point as he breezed to victory against Kecmanovic, facing just one break point all match.

World number 49 Kecmanovic knows only too well what his Davis Cup team-mate is capable of and was largely unable to stem the flow from a free-hitting Djokovic.

Numerous rallies were met with gasps from the crowd as Djokovic demonstrated his still-sublime movement and prowess as one of the best returners in the sport.

A lengthy point which ended with Djokovic sitting on the turf having fired down a brilliant backhand winner while off balance was met with a standing ovation from a crowd enthralled by the veteran's capabilities.

Having needed just one break of serve to seal the opener, Djokovic immediately put his opponent on the backfoot in set two and swiftly wrapped up a triple break without giving Kecmanovic a sniff.

The contest was perhaps best summed up by Kecmanovic raising a fist to the crowd as he won the opening game of the third set, finally halting Djokovic's nine-game streak.

The only blemish on a near-flawless performance from Djokovic came as he tried to serve out the win.

One fan shouted "Don't panic Novak!" as he went 15-30 down on serve, ironically poking fun at what had largely been a demolition.

Sure of the inevitable outcome, the crowd began to get under his skin in an attempt to prolong the match and Djokovic suffered his only break of the match.

But it was not enough to turn the tide and Djokovic served out at the second opportunity, delivering a message to his peers that he remains someone to beat here.

If he continues on this trajectory, a semi-final meeting with Italian top seed Jannik Sinner feels inevitable, with the world number one producing an equally dominant performance on Centre Court earlier on Saturday.

Not since 2017 has Djokovic suffered defeat by someone other than Carlos Alcaraz at SW19, losing to this year's defending champion in the past two finals having won the previous four.

But if Djokovic is to clinch that record major it seems he knows this might just be his best chance.

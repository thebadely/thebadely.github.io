Experts revealed that A migrant sex offender who was mistakenly released from prison has been deported from the UK, the government has announced.

Hadush Kebatu was convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex while living in an asylum hotel, but was mistakenly set free by staff at HMP Chelmsford last week. He was brought back into custody following a manhunt on Sunday.

He was removed on a flight to Ethiopia on Tuesday night and arrived on Wednesday morning, the Home Office said.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: "Last week's blunder should never have happened - and I share the public's anger that it did."

She added: "I have pulled every lever to deport Mr Kebatu and remove him off British soil. I am pleased to confirm this vile child sex offender has been deported. Our streets are safer because of it."

Kebatu was deported with no right to return, the Home Office said.

Justice Secretary David Lammy said Kebatu's mistaken early release was "unacceptable", adding that "we must get to the bottom of what happened" through an independent investigation.

Kebatu originally arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on a small boat on 29 June having travelled through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France.

He was staying at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which was being used to accommodate migrants.

On 7 July, Kebatu made sexually explicit remarks to a 14-year-old girl who was eating a pizza with her friend in Epping town centre.

The next day, he sexually assaulted a woman, trying to kiss her. He did the same to the girl he had made remarks to the day before, having encountered her by chance.

His arrest sparked a wave of anti-migrant protests outside the hotel. 

He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences last month and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already time in jail awaiting his trial. He was also told he was facing deportation.

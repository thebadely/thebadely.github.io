According to new developments, Bottles of the almond liquor Disaronno have been recalled over fears they could be contaminated by glass. 

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a recall notice on Tuesday for 700ml bottles of the drink being sold in England and Scotland. 

In a notice placed on its website, the FSA said Illva Saronno, the brand's parent company, was recalling bottles of Disaronno Originale because of "the possible presence of small pieces of glass within some bottles of product, which could make it unsafe to drink".

It has identified seven batches which could include potentially contaminated bottles. 

Recall notices will now be placed at the point of sale in the shops where the bottles were sold, advising customers on what to do. 

The potential contamination is thought to have happened due to an "anomaly on the bottle line", according to the recall notice. 

The affected bottles have the following codes 25374, 25375, 25381, 25382, 25435, 25442, 25444, and consumers are able to check the numbers on the back of a bottle. 

The recall follows a similar notice issued in the Republic of Ireland on Monday, recalling the same product for the same issue. 

Recall notices are not uncommon, and can be issued for a number of different reasons. 

On Tuesday, health food brand Grape Tree issued recall notices for two of its products due to possible contamination with undeclared peanuts and milk.

It has been recently reported that Olav Kooij made his Tour of Britain debut in 2023

Dutch rider Olav Kooij won the opening stage of the Tour of Britain after fending off a strong challenge from Tord Gudmestad.

The pair went toe-to-toe in the closing stage of the 167.6km route between Woodbridge and Southwold. 

But the 23-year-old Team Visma-Lease a Bike rider crossed the finish line ahead of Norway's Gudmestad, of Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale, to claim a fifth stage win at the Tour of Britain since his debut in 2023.

"It's a really good feeling, of course. It's always nice to win a race, and I have good memories from here two years ago," Kooij said.

"I was happy to come back to this race, and I'm really happy to continue the success of two years ago."

France's Hugo Hofstetter of Israel-Premier Tech finished third, while Ineos Grenadiers' Samuel Watson was the first British rider to cross the line in sixth place.

Kooij leads the general classification with Gudmestad in second and Hofstetter third after stage one, which needed an early diversion  because of a burst water main.

Great Britain's Joshua Golliker, meanwhile, is fifth in the overall standings. 

The 2025 Tour of Britain will also be the final professional race of Geraint Thomas' illustrious 19-year career. 

The 39-year-old Welshman, who won the Tour de France in 2018, sustained a puncture on the opening stage but recovered to finish with the main field. 

The second stage on Wednesday will start and finish in Stowmarket, with the sixth and final stage finishing in Thomas' home city of Cardiff on Sunday.

Let's dive into the details: Tom O'Flaherty secured the try bonus point with his second score shortly after the hour mark

Investec Champions Cup Pool 1

Sale (7) 26

Tries: Ma'asi-White, Rodd, O'Flaherty 2 Cons: Ford 3 

Sharks (3) 10

Tries: Tshituka Cons: Masuku Pens: Masuku

A much-improved second-half performance helped Sale beat South African side the Sharks and confirmed their passage to the Investec Champions Cup last 16.

Siya Masuku's penalty put the visitors ahead before Sale centre Rekeiti Ma'asi-White scored the only try of an error-strewn opening period to give the hosts a slender half-time advantage.

England prop Bevan Rodd burrowed over on 49 minutes and Tom O'Flaherty crossed soon after to put Sale 19-3 up, before Sharks flanker Manu Tshituka scored a wonderful individual try to reduce the arrears.

But Sale hit back immediately and O'Flaherty's second score shortly after the hour mark secured the bonus point - and Alex Sanderson's men stood firm from that point on to ensure their opponents left with nothing.

After falling behind to Masuku's penalty Sale responded quickly and their building pressure told when Ma'asi-White collected a short pass before crossing the whitewash.

Sharks, without the majority of their South Africa internationals including captain Siya Kolisi, were enjoying plenty of possession and providing an attacking threat, but after several phases of probing the Sale defence around the 20-minute mark they opted to kick in behind and lost possession.

Sale debutant Obi Ene looked sharp on the wing but his side were struggling to build momentum with handling errors allowing the Sharks to counter regularly and on one such foray forward blind-side flanker Tino Mavesere came close to scoring but dropped the ball in contact five metres short of the tryline.

The hosts escaped again shortly before the break when full-back Hakeem Kunene broke clear only for Sale winger O'Flaherty to come back with a vital covering tackle.

Sharks fly-half Masuku tried his luck with a penalty from his own half early in the second period, and although it had the length he sent the kick wide of the posts.

It took Sale until the 49th minute to get their second try as a catch and drive from a five-metre line-out allowed Rodd to score.

George Ford's superb kick to the corner then set up Sale's third soon after. With the line-out ball secured, Ene spun it wide to fellow wing O'Flaherty who ran in unopposed.

Just as Sale looked like they were well on top, Sharks flanker Tshituka scored an excellent try, picking the ball from the base of a ruck and beating Ford all ends up before racing away to the line.

But the hosts hit back immediately through O'Flaherty who secured the try bonus point on 61 minutes, with the five points ensuring Sale's qualification and leaving the Sharks reliant on other results to stay in the Champions Cup.

Sale face a tough game at Toulouse next Saturday (17:30 GMT) which is likely to determine whether they have a home or away tie in the last 16, while the Sharks finish the pool stage with a home fixture against bottom side Clermont earlier on the same day (13:00).

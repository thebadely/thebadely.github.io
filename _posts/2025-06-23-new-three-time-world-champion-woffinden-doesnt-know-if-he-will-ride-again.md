Let's dive into the details: Three-time speedway world champion Tai Woffinden has admitted he "does not know" if he will return to the sport.

The 34-year-old, from Scunthorpe, was placed into a medically-induced coma after a serious crash in Poland in March.

Woffinden sat down with his wife Faye to discuss the crash on his Youtube channel and admitted he did not know "what the plan is moving forward" or "if I'm going ride again".

"I feel like I'd like to sit on my bike at some point and maybe do a few laps but I just don't know," he said.

The crash, on 30 March, happened when Woffinden collided with a teammate and hit a fence behind a protective barrier.

It left him with a double break in his right leg, a broken back, broken shoulder, multiple broken ribs, a punctured lung, fractured arm and extensive blood loss.

He said: "I was sliding along the track and I knew it was going to hurt. I heard my femur snap. I couldn't see either of my hands because my arm was broken.

"I was completely conscious through everything that happened and remember everything from the crash. I was in the helicopter being airlifted to hospital and that's when I passed out."

Woffinden, who is the country's most decorated rider after winning Grand Prix world titles in 2013, 2015 and 2018, said he was unsure if he would ride again.

He said: "I've got a goal in my head to be back as fast as I can but that's just something I need to chase, to focus on and give me that drive.

"The reality is I don't know what's next for me."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dugdale won 43 caps for Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland defender Rachel Dugdale has announced her retirement as a player at the age of 28.

The last of Dugdale's 43 caps came in a 1-1 draw against Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Nations League in June.

She made her Northern Ireland debut in March 2016 against Slovakia in the Istria Cup but missed the 2022 European Championship after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

At club level, Dugdale had spells with Doncaster Rovers Belles, US university side Eagles Women, Charlton Athletic, Coventry United Ladies and Reading Women.

Her most recent club was Blackburn Rovers Women, who withdrew from the Championship in May and now play in the fourth tier of English football.

"To the mighty GAWA, I announce my retirement from international and professional football. It is with a heavy heart but immense pride that I share this news," she said in a statement.

"Representing Northern Ireland since I was 15 has been the greatest honour of my career. Being part of the journey to our first ever major tournament was a dream come true, and I will cherish that memory forever.

"Thank you for your amazing support over the years. While it's scary to step away from the game I love, I am excited for the new chapter ahead. This team and these fans will always hold a special place in my heart."

Dugdale was a regular in Northern Ireland squads under boss Tanya Oxtoby, who has paid tribute to the defender's "leadership" qualities.

"Rachel has been such an important part of the transition period over the last 18 months. Her leadership and ability to set the right standards every single day has enhanced our culture immensely and that will be hard to replace," the Australian said.

"I can't wait to see her embrace and succeed on her next journey, and we will all miss her around the group massively."

It has been recently reported that Rubin Colwill (left) and Joel Colwill are the first brothers to start for Cardiff City since Gary and Dave Bennett in 1983

Cardiff City midfielder Joel Colwill says having his brother, Rubin, providing the assist for his first goal for the club took the emotion "to another level".

The Bluebirds were already two goals up against Cheltenham Town in the second round of the EFL Cup when substitute Rubin found his younger brother Joel to put the result beyond doubt.

Rubin Colwill was in plenty of space on the edge of the area when he opted to play in his brother with a pass that may not have been played to any other player.

"If it was anyone else in the box he may have shot, so I will thank him for that when we get home," said Joel Colwill.

"The other day I was talking about how special it was to be playing together, to have one of us assisting the other is on another level again.

"It's a moment me and him will cherish."

The Colwills became the first brothers to start a game for the Bluebirds in more than 40 years when they lined up on the opening day of the season against Peterborough United.

Since, older brother Rubin has scored three goals and Joel added his first against Cheltenham, as Cardiff remain unbeaten through seven games.

And while Rubin Colwill has in the past been the one to grab the headlines for the League One leaders, Joel says there is no rivalry between the pair.

"I want Rubin to be the best player he can be, there's no rivalry or shadow," said Joel Colwill.

"If I'm in my brother's shadow it's a really proud thing because we are both playing for our dream club Cardiff City.

"I'm proud of him more than anything, just happy for him."

Cardiff head coach Brian Barry-Murphy said the smart finish from Joel Colwill against Cheltenham replicated what he has been doing in training.

The former Manchester City academy coach, who remains unbeaten as Bluebirds boss, has challenged the younger Colwill to add more goals to his game this season.

"It was a good finish from Joel, we expect him to score a lot of goals this season," said Barry-Murphy.

"To see him finish in that manner is what we have seen in training.

"It's time for him to start showing that goal-scoring prowess we know he is capable of."

The challenge is one Joel Colwill is prepared to take on.

"I want to score as many goals as I can and add another level to my game," said Joel Colwill.

"I think Rubin has three this season, hopefully I catch him and we both finish on however many!"

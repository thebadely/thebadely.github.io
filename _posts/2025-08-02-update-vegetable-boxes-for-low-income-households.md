Let's dive into the details: A charity is offering free vegetable boxes for low income families who struggle to purchase fresh food.

Growing Well will donate up to 30 of its weekly boxes for free to households across Mid Copeland in Cumbria.

The mental health recovery charity said the areas covered include Thornhill, Haile, Calderbridge, Ponsonby, Beckermet, Seascale and Gosforth and the process is fully confidential.

Harvested weekly, each box includes seven different seasonal vegetables which will be delivered to the recipients' doors or can be collected from a nearby collection point.

Hannah Wright, manager at Growing Well West Cumbria, said: "We know there are families, couples and individuals who are on a low income and are struggling and would benefit from support with regular fresh vegetables."

She added the sign-up process is "quick and completely confidential".

The new scheme is funded by the Mid Copeland GDF Community Partnership.

It has been recently reported that Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Nathan Lyon

Australia have named their squad for the opening Ashes Test against England as they look to extend their grip on the urn into a second decade.

Captain and pace bowler Pat Cummins will miss the first Test as he recovers from a back injury, with Scott Boland set to take his place in the team.

Tasmania's Jake Weatherald has earned a maiden call-up and may open the batting.

The series starts on 21 November, with the fifth and final Test beginning on 4 January.

BBC Sport profiles each player, including the absent Cummins, and looks at their Test career and recent form.

Australia Ashes squad - only one player under 30

How to follow the Ashes across the BBC

Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?

Age: 32; Tests: 71; Wickets: 309; Average: 22.10; Best figures: 6-23

Cummins will miss the opening Test in Perth but has ramped up his preparations with the aim of being available for the second game in Brisbane.

He is fourth in the International Cricket Council's Test bowling rankings and has taken 91 wickets in 19 Ashes Test at an average of 24.10.

Cummins averages 19.92 in home conditions throughout his career and Joe Root is the batter he has dismissed the most (11).

Age: 38; Tests: 84; Runs: 6,053; Average: 43.86; Centuries: 16

Australia's top order has been problematic in recent times but Khawaja has been the one certainty for this series.

The left-hander averages 44.23 in 35 innings against England, with four centuries.

His average is 49.90 in home conditions and how he fares in the Ashes may go a long way to deciding the outcome.

He averages 53.98 in Tests in 2025 so is in good touch. 

Age: 31; Tests: Uncapped

The 31-year-old has been called up to the squad for the first time, with Sam Konstas, Nathan McSweeney - both of whom made their debut last year - and Matt Renshaw left out.

Chief selector George Bailey described Weatherald as "really solid" and said they like how he builds an innings and the rate he scores at.

However, Bailey stopped short of confirming he would make his debut in Perth.

Weatherald averages 41.33 in three Sheffield Shield matches this season, having finished last season as the top run-scorer and with an average of 50.33.

Age: 31; Tests: 58; Runs: 4,435; Average: 46.19; Centuries: 11

For quite a while it felt like Labuschagne would not be part of Australia's squad, but he forced his way back in thanks to a superb start to the domestic season.

He has hit five centuries in all formats, including three in the Sheffield Shield, where he averages 85.25 in four innings.

His role in the side may depend on the fitness of Cameron Green. If Green can bowl, Labuschagne is likely to bat at three, but he may have to open if Green plays as a specialist batter. 

Labuschagne was dropped for the Test series in West Indies in July after averaging 25.84 and failing to score a century in 15 Tests.

The 31-year-old, who made his Ashes debut as Test cricket's first concussion sub in 2019, averages 40.64 in 14 Tests against England.

Age: 26; Tests: 32; Runs: 1,565; Average: 34.02; Wickets: 35; Average: 35.31

Green was always going to be part of Australia's squad but his role in the side has been up for debate. 

Having played as a specialist batter because of back injuries, he has returned to bowling in domestic cricket in recent weeks.

That opens up the possibility of Green being used as the all-rounder at six in Australia's side, with a batter at three.

He averages 27.58 with the bat in eight Tests against England - down on a career average of 34.02 - and has taken 18 wickets.

Age: 36; Tests: 119; Runs: 10,477; Average: 56.02; Centuries: 36

Smith is the glue in Australia's batting, particularly now he is back at four after a brief stint as an opener.

He averages 56.01 against England and 59.70 across his career in Australia.

He will captain the side in the first Test in Cummins' absence, but his form is sure to have a huge impact on the outcome of the series.

Age: 31; Tests: 60; Runs: 3,963; Average: 41.71; Centuries: 9

Head is the X-factor in Australia's batting line-up and is capable of taking the game away from England in an hour.

The left-hander is short of form, though, with a top score of 31 in eight white-ball innings since the start of October.

That resulted in him skipping the final two games of a T20 series against India to play in the last round of Sheffield Shield before the Ashes from 10 November.  

Head, 31, averages 39.56 in 13 Tests against England and 51.52 in home conditions over his career.

Age: 30; Tests: 3; Runs: 119; Average: 29.75; Centuries: 0

Inglis, who was born in Leeds, has been Australia's spare middle-order batter in recent years and continues for the first Test.

He is yet to play a Test at home but is a regular in their white-ball side and is an aggressive batter. He will also be the spare keeper if anything happens to Alex Carey.

He is yet to play in the Sheffield Shield this season but averaged 72.60 in three games last year.

Age: 31; Tests: 7; Runs: 381; Average: 34.63; Wickets: 8; Average: 23.25

The 31-year-old made his Test debut against India last December and has been the all-rounder in the side since.

However, the potential bowling return of Green and the form of Labuschagne may mean Webster finds himself out of the side.

He made two hard-fought half-centuries in tricky conditions against West Indies, adding to one in the World Test Championship final against South Africa, so he has shown he can be a gritty character when needed.

Age: 34; Tests: 43; Runs: 2,010; Average: 34.65; Centuries: 2; Dismissals: 177

Carey is an established part of Australia's side and there is very little pressure on his spot.

The left-hander is capable of absorbing pressure or going through the gears with the bat depending on the situation.

Carey controversially stumped Jonny Bairstow in the 2023 Ashes at Lord's, so he has history with England.

He averages 21.27 in 10 Tests against England, compared to his career average of 34.65 and 31.68 in home conditions.

Age: 35; Tests: 100; Wickets: 402; Average: 27.02; Best figures: 6-9

Starc is a new-ball menace in all conditions, but particularly in day-night Tests.

The left-armer has 81 wickets and averages 17.08 in 14 pink-ball Tests, so watch out for him in Brisbane.

He has taken 97 wickets in 22 Ashes Tests at an average of 27.37, removing Ben Stokes nine times and Joe Root eight.

Starc is handy with the bat too, averaging 20.19 against England, with 11 half-centuries.

Age: 34; Tests: 76; Wickets: 295; Average: 24.21; Best figures: 6-67

Hazlewood has been an integral part of a formidable trio alongside Cummins and Starc - whom he shares new-ball duties with - for several years.

He has taken 76 wickets at an average of 25.97 in 18 Ashes Tests and averages 22.70 in home Tests over his career. He has removed Root 10 times - more than any other batter.

Hazlewood missed three of the five Tests against India in Australia's most recent home summer and his absence would impact their chances.

Age: 36; Tests: 14; Wickets: 62; Average: 16.53; Best figures: 6-7

Boland has been the spare seamer around Australia's squad since making his debut in the 2021 Ashes.

He is a more than dependable replacement and is set to feature in the first Test in Cummins' absence.

Boland has taken 20 wickets in five Tests against England, averaging 20.15, while across his whole Test career he averages a ridiculous 12.63 in home conditions.

However, England attacked him in the 2023 series on home soil, when he averaged 48. Expect the same approach this time round.

Age: 37; Tests: 139; Wickets: 562; Average: 30.14; Best figures: 8-50

Off-spinner Lyon is the seventh-most prolific bowler in Test history and needs only two wickets to climb above compatriot Glenn McGrath into sixth.

Pitches in Australia have produced more movement in recent years, so Lyon's influence has decreased slightly, as shown by his nine wickets at 36.88 apiece against India last year.

There is a chance he may not make the team in some Ashes Tests, but he has often been England's nemesis, taking 110 wickets in 30 Tests at 29.41.

Lyon was injured in the 2023 Ashes and famously hobbled out to bat at Lord's, but he will be keen to write some more positive memories in what is likely to be his last series against England.

Age: 33; Tests: Uncapped

Abbott has been a pretty regular part of Australia's white-ball teams in recent years but has not featured in Tests.

He has been part of squads but has been unable to break up the formidable Cummins-Hazlewood-Starc trio.

He took one wicket in his Sheffield Shield game this season but is expected to play in the round of matches that start on 10 November. He claimed 19 wickets at an average of 21.94 last season.

He averages 24.62 with the bat in first-class cricket so would add batting depth to Australia if called upon.

Age: 31; Tests: Uncapped

Doggett will be the other spare seamer in the squad after impressing in Sheffield Shield cricket in recent years.

He claimed match figures of 7-86 in his only outing this season, having taken 33 wickets at 24.15 apiece last season.

He had a three-game spell with Durham this summer, taking nine wickets in three matches at 33.44.

All ages and stats correct as of 5 November.

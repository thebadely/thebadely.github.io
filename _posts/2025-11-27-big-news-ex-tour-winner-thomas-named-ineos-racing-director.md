Let's dive into the details: Geraint Thomas' cycling career began with the Maindy club in Cardiff

Former Tour de France and Olympic champion Geraint Thomas has been named Ineos Grenadiers director of racing.

The 39-year-old Welshman retired from racing in summer 2025 after a glittering career.

"This team has been my home since day one, and stepping into this role feels like a natural next step," said Thomas.

"I've learnt so much from the people around me - fellow riders and staff - and I now want to continue building on our incredible past success into the future."

Sir David Brailsford, who remains an influential figure at Ineos, said: "Geraint typifies what it means to be a Grenadier. 

"He has lived and breathed elite performance throughout his career. He always set himself very ambitious goals and invariably went on to achieve them."

Ineos won 28 races in 2025, up from their low of 14 in 2024, but have not won a Grand Tour since Egan Bernal at the Giro d'Italia in 2021.

Thomas, the 2018 Tour de France winner under the team's former guise of Team Sky, finished on Grand Tour podiums three other times.

He also helped Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins win the prestigious three-week race around France as they dominated the event, winning it seven times between 2012 and 2019.

Brailsford, who returned to a more hands-on role at Ineos earlier this year having previously stepped down his involvement to take up a position at Manchester United, will be hoping Thomas can help revive their fortunes.

"He knows what the process takes, how to deal with the highs and lows of elite sport and his willingness to now share this and mentor others to do the same is a great asset for the team," added 61-year-old.

"The fact that he has stayed so humble and always maintained a great sense of humour are also great attributes to bring to his new role."

Former Whitchurch High School pupil Thomas was also successful on the track, winning Olympic gold in Beijing, China, in 2008 and London in 2012. 

He also enjoyed success for Wales at the Commonwealth Games.

Thomas' career began in his home city of Cardiff as a child and ended there in September as the 2025 Tour of Britain concluded.

Ineos stated Thomas "will work closely with Sir Dave Brailsford, Dr Scott Drawer - and the rest of the senior management team, providing crucial input into race strategy, rider recruitment, development and race readiness".

The team's statement added: "His appointment reflects the team's long-term commitment to building from within, harnessing his immense knowledge of the sport and what it takes to win, for the benefit of his fellow Grenadiers."

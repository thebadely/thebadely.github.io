Let's dive into the details: George Weah served as the president of Liberia from 2018 to 2024

Football legends George Weah and Didier Drogba are among the high-profile names appointed to a new Fifa panel of 16 ex-players which aims to bolster efforts to tackle racism in the game.

The sport's global governing body originally announced the creation of a players' voice panel at its annual congress in Thailand in May 2024.

Former AC Milan striker Weah and ex-Chelsea forward Drogba have now been named as part of the group which includes players - both men and women - from 14 countries.

The panel will advise on anti-racism strategies, participate in educational programmes and contribute to reforms across football.

"Football brings unity and development. It also enhances humanity," said Weah, who has been named as the panel's 'honorary captain'. 

"I will always exert all efforts, as I have done in the past and continue to do, to promote the sport because football is life. I am honoured to serve in this role."

Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the panel members will "support education at all levels of the game" and "promote new ideas for lasting change".

"They will further push for a shift in football culture, making sure measures to counter racism are not just talked about, but actioned, both on and off the pitch," Infantino said in a statement.

"Let's be clear on this: racism and discrimination are not simply wrong - they are crimes. All incidents of racism, whether in stadiums or online, must be fully punished both by football and across society."

Experts revealed that Lucas Paqueta has 18 months remaining on his contract at West Ham

Flamengo are close to re-signing West Ham forward Lucas Paqueta for more than 41m euros (Â£35.5m).

The 28-year-old, who moved to West Ham from Lyon in 2022, wants to join Brazilian club Flamengo before the winter transfer deadline on 2 February.

West Ham have been open to agreeing a deal for Paqueta on the basis the Brazil attacker would stay at London Stadium on loan for the rest of the season.

The Hammers have won three matches in succession for the first time since 2023 without Paqueta, who has been unavailable in recent weeks.

However, 18th-placed West Ham remain in the Premier League's relegation zone, five points adrift of safety.

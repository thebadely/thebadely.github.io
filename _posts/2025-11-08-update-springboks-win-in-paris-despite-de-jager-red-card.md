World champions South Africa completed another memorable victory over France in Paris despite playing for more than half of their autumn international at Stade de France with 14 men.

This was the first meeting between the two sides since the Springboks beat host nation France in a thrilling Rugby World Cup quarter-final at the same venue in October 2023.

Another close finish looked likely but South Africa gained momentum from Louis Bielle-Biarrey's second-half yellow card and surged to victory.

France led 14-13 at the end of a breathless first half which included Damian Penaud becoming France's all-time leading try-scorer with the first of his two scores, a brilliant individual reply by South Africa scrum-half Cobus Reinach and a red card for Springboks lock Lood de Jager.

De Jager made shoulder contact with the head of France full-back Thomas Ramos and was sent off by referee Angus Gardner just before half-time.

Ramos, who had brilliantly created and converted both of Penaud's tries, added a second-half penalty to stretch France's lead to four points but, crucially, South Africa remained in touch.

Winger Bielle-Biarrey was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on and, almost immediately, South Africa led for the first time when Andre Esterhuizen touched down from a rolling maul.

Springboks captain Siya Kolisi, on the occasion of his 100th cap, was replaced at half-time but barked encouragement to his team-mates from the touchline and watched late tries from Grant Williams and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu secure a superb Test victory.

Earlier on Saturday, Italy completed their second consecutive win against Australia, having lost all previous 18 meetings between the two nations.

Louis Lynagh, the Italy-born son of Wallabies legend Michael Lynagh, and Australia-born Monty Ioane scored Italy's tries in the 26-19 victory in Udine.

Here’s what you need to know: Pimblett (left) has won 23 of his professional fights

Paddy Pimblett will fight Justin Gaethje for the interim lightweight title at UFC 324 in Las Vegas on 24 January.

The bout between Liverpool's Pimblett and American Gaethje has been set up after champion Ilia Topuria revealed he will not fight in the first quarter of 2026 because of a "difficult moment" in his personal life.

Pimblett, 30, is fifth in the UFC's lightweight rankings with 37-year-old Gaethje one place above him.

Topuria, who won the title after knocking out Charles Oliveira in July, added that the UFC will "make the match-ups needed" in his absence.

"I won't be fighting in the first quarter of next year. I'm going through a difficult moment in my personal life," the Georgian-Spaniard wrote on X., external

"I want to focus on my children and resolve this situation as soon as possible.

"I don't want to hold up the division. As soon as the matters are resolved I'll let the UFC know I'm ready to begin my return."

Pimblett last fought in April where he stopped American Michael Chandler in the third round for his seventh-straight win in the UFC.

His performances inside the octagon, coupled with his lively personality and passionate speeches about men's mental health, have seen Pimblett blossom into one of the UFC's most popular fighters.

His title shot comes despite not holding a win over any fighter in the current top 10 and with other viable contenders above him in the rankings.

Armenia's Arman Tsarukyan beat Dan Hooker in Qatar last week to solidify his number one ranking, before calling for a title bout against Topuria.

Oliveira (second) and Max Holloway (third) also do not have upcoming fights booked, although both have already lost to Topuria.

Earlier this month, Hooker revealed his bemusement at Pimblett's lightweight ranking, adding the UFC "must be cherry-picking him for a title shot".

Gaethje last fought in March, earning a unanimous decision win over Rafael Fizief, and has won nine of 14 UFC bouts since making his debut in 2017.

He is a former interim champion after beating Tony Ferguson for the belt in 2020, but suffered defeat by Khabib Nurmagomedov in a unification bout five months later.

The event at the T-Mobile Arena will be the UFC's first under its seven-year deal with streaming platform Paramount, marking a move away from its pay-per-view model. 

The co-main event sees American bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison make the first defence of her title against the returning Amanda Nunes.

Brazil's former double champion Nunes - who many regard as the best women's fighter of all time - is ending her retirement after leaving the sport in 2023.

It has been recently reported that People are being offered a £40 shopping voucher in return for completing a money session.

The Let's Talk Money course will look at topics such as formulating a budget and using online price comparison tools.

East Riding of Yorkshire Council said the course was designed to help residents gain a better understanding of their finances and the support available to improve financial literacy.

Sessions are free to anyone aged 19 and over with an income of less than £25,000. A charge applies to anyone who earns over that threshold. The courses will take place in Beverley, Bridlington, Cottingham, Goole and Withernsea.

Council leader Anne Handley said: "We're proud to support lifelong learning across the East Riding, including on improving financial literacy. We strongly encourage interested residents to find out more and sign up for these excellent sessions."

The sessions will held on the following dates:

Further sessions will run in January and February, the council added.

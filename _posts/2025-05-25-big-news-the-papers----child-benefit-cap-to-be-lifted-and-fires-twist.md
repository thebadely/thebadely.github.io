Let's dive into the details: An accusation by Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates that the government is presiding over a "quasi kangaroo court" system for compensation for victims of the Horizon IT scandal is the lead in the Sunday Times.

In a column inside the paper, Sir Alan explains that many full claims from victims - including his own - have not been settled because of demands for documentation that he says many cannot provide. He says a new "independent" body to deal with public sector scandals is needed to ensure a better way of delivering justice. The Department for Business says anyone unhappy with their compensation offer can have their case reviewed by an independent panel of experts.

The Observer declares that Sir Keir Starmer is going to scrap the child benefit cap - which means that parents can currently claim tax credits only for their first two children.

The Sunday Telegraph expands on Nigel Farage's promise that Reform UK will do the same and re-instate the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. Farage, the paper says, is working to "outflank" the prime minister in an appeal to "left-leaning" voters.

The Telegraph also reports that President Donald Trump has sent US officials to meet British pro-life activists over what it says are concerns that their "freedom of speech" has been threatened. It reports that the five-person team met five activists who had been arrested for silently protesting outside abortion clinics in the UK. The paper says it is the latest sign of the Trump administration's willingness to intervene in domestic British affairs. The Cabinet Office has declined to comment.

The Mail on Sunday reports that MI5 is investigating whether Russian spies are behind a series of arson attacks on property linked to Sir Keir. The paper says any suggestion of the Kremlin's involvement would be "an extraordinary escalation" in tensions between the UK and Russia.

The story is also the lead in the Sunday Mirror which quotes a source as saying that Russian involvement was the "first option considered". It says the government is looking at whether the three Ukrainian-born men, who have been charged in connection with the attacks, may have been "recruited" by the Kremlin. They deny the charges. The police are said to be keeping an "open mind", the paper says. Downing Street has not commented.

Athletes who use weight-loss jabs like Ozempic and Wegovy to enhance performance may find themselves banned from the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the Sunday Express. The paper says the World Anti-Doping Agency has added semaglutide, the jab's active ingredient, to a list of substances it monitors.

A number of the papers carry photos of the latest addition to Boris Johnson's family - a baby girl called Poppy, born last Wednesday. She's the fourth child for the former prime minister and his wife, Carrie, who said she was their "final gang member".

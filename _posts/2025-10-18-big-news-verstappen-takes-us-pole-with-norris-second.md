According to new developments, Max Verstappen won the US Grand Prix sprint race earlier on Saturday

Red Bull's Max Verstappen beat McLaren's Lando Norris to pole position at the United States Grand Prix with championship leader Oscar Piastri down in sixth.

After the McLaren drivers crashed out of the sprint earlier on Saturday, neither was able to challenge Verstappen even though the world champion failed to complete a final run in qualifying.

Verstappen was sent out too late to get around in time to start a last lap before the chequered flag but still beat Norris by 0.291 seconds.

It was an imperious performance that underlined why McLaren are concerned about his threat in the drivers' championship.

Norris saved his best for last in a difficult session to pip Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to second on the grid by just 0.006secs.

But Piastri, who has looked out of sorts all weekend, was not quick and he ended up 0.574secs off the pace, and behind Mercedes' George Russell and the second Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton.

Piastri leads Verstappen by 55 points heading into the grand prix, with Norris 22 behind the Australian.

Verstappen, who topped every session of qualifying, said: "It was good, every segment the car was very strong, just trying to put the lap together around here is very tricky.

"The first run in Q3 was good. Just managed to improve a little bit on Q2. I didn't manage to do my final run, it was a bit messy with the out laps but fortunately we didn't need it."

Norris said: "It was a bit more of a struggle today for whatever reason, yesterday was quite comfortable.

"I don't know whether others have improved or whether the wind has changed. And it was a bit more of a struggle to keep up with this guy. There was no chance we could have got pole today.

"I look forward to hopefully have a good race with Max. We've had some good ones in the past."

Leclerc had a spin out of the last corner on his first run in qualifying and did not expect such a strong lap at his final attempt.

"It was quite big surprise, especially considering the weekend has been very difficult," he said. "There are still things we need to understand from this car, there is too much of a swing without changing much the car."

Piastri, who started third for the sprint, struggled throughout qualifying and never looked quick.

"Just a tricky session, didn't really feel terribly comfortable out there and the lap times show (it)," he said. "But a long race tomorrow and a lot can happen so try and make up some ground.

"(The car was) just a little bit unpredictable. It was very tight for the positions ahead of me. Some things to try and look at."

Russell gained one place from his grid position for the sprint, which he finished second, and Hamilton was just 0.105secs off Leclerc in putting the Ferrari fifth.

The seven-time world champion said: "We had a bit of improvement compared to yesterday. The car still wasn't quite right throughout qualifying. I had massive understeer from the beginning so bit by bit I was adding and adding wing. 

"Towards the end it got a little bit better but it's almost too late that you get that confidence. To be third and fifth is a real step forward."

Behind Piastri, Kimi Antonelli put the second Mercedes seventh, while Oliver Bearman secured the best of the rest position in eighth place for Haas, ahead of the Williams of Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.

Isack Hadjar will start on the back row after crashing heavily at the start of qualifying, losing control of his Racing Bulls going into Turn Six.

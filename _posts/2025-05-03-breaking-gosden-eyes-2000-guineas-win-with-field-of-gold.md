Let's dive into the details: Field Of Gold was installed favourite for the Betfred 2000 Guineas (Saturday 15:35 BST) after winning over course and distance last month

John Gosden will saddle leading contender Field Of Gold as the top trainer looks to finally win the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on Saturday.

The 74-year-old, who set up as a trainer nearby in 1989, has won all four of the other British Classics and more than 3,000 races in all.

Now training alongside son Thady, he hopes his impressive Craven Stakes winner can close the missing gap in his illustrious CV.

"It has never weighed on my mind. It seems to be glaring to everyone else but not to me," said Gosden senior.

"It's nice to have a horse who at the moment is favourite, but it doesn't mean that you're going to win it."

Field Of Gold heads 11 contenders for the big race.

Charlie Appleby's Ruling Court is another leading fancy after a six-length victory in Dubai in March, with the Godolphin handler also fielding Shadow Of Light, winner of both the Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes last term.

Ruling Court is the choice of first jockey William Buick, with Mickael Barzalona taking the ride on Shadow Of Light.

Godolphin also has a third runner in the Saeed bin Suroor-trained Tornado Alert.

Aidan O'Brien, seeking an 11th 2000 Guineas victory, has Dewhurst runner-up Expanded as his sole representative.

Jessica Harrington's Green Impact and the Joseph O'Brien-trained Scorthy Champ complete the Irish contenders.

Craven second Wimbledon Hawkeye represents James Owen while fourth-placed Benevento also features, along with Yah Mo Be There.

Seagulls Eleven runs for owners that are all current or former Brighton and Hove Albion footballers, including James Milner and Danny Welbeck.

It has been recently reported that Liverpool beat Tottenham at the Estadio Metropolitano to win the 2019 Champions League final

Madrid will host the 2027 men's Champions League final - with Warsaw to stage the women's final.

Atletico Madrid's 70,000-capacity Estadio Metropolitano has been awarded the men's showpiece after Milan's San Siro was stripped of the honour.

Uefa decided to reopen bidding for the event amid concerns about refurbishment plans at the San Siro - and the match will now take place in the Spanish capital.

Madrid's Estadio Metropolitano last hosted the Champions League final in 2019, when Liverpool beat Tottenham.

The women's final will be staged in Poland's capital, at Warsaw's Stadion Narodowy.

Uefa also announced that the Super Cup match in 2026 will take place in Salzburg, Austria.

Uefa took the decisions at a meeting of its executive committee in Tirana in Albania where it also discussed requests from Spain and Italy's football associations to play domestic league matches abroad but did not come to a decision on the issue.

"The committee acknowledged it as an important and growing issue but expressed the desire to ensure that it has the views of all stakeholders before coming to a final decision," said a Uefa statement.

"There are many issues to resolve and as the European governing body, Uefa has a responsibility to take all such factors into account.

"As a result, no decision was taken today but Uefa will undertake a round of consultation with all stakeholders in European football - including fans."

The executive committee did approve an amendment to the 2025-26 Uefa club competitions' regulations that will permit clubs to temporarily replace one outfield player with a long-term injury or illness in their squads during the league phase until matchday six.

Uefa said: "The reasoning for the adaptation is to ensure that squad lists are not unfairly reduced and players are safeguarded from additional workload pressure."

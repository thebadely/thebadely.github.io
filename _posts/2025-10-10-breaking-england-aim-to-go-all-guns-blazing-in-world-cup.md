It has been recently reported that Tammy Beaumont was part of England's World Cup-winning side in 2017

Although fixtures against Sri Lanka and Pakistan should be straightforward for England as they look to continue their winning streak, they could prove decisive with back-to-back matches against India and Australia to come.

England thrashed South Africa in what could have been a tricky opener, avoided a scare against Bangladesh and now have a golden opportunity to make sure they go into those games against the pre-tournament favourites unbeaten.

But they will have to contend with more spin-friendly conditions in Colombo on Saturday, with opener Tammy Beaumont saying the nature of the pitches is reducing the gulf between teams.

"Every game in this World Cup is big. Bangladesh played so well against us and Sri Lanka will be a challenge in home conditions," she told BBC Sport.

"The conditions are bringing all the teams into it, so it's important we have to keep playing well.

"It certainly feels like the fixtures have worked quite well for us, so hopefully we can keep building that momentum and it will be all guns blazing by the time we get to Indore."

The surface in Indore is likely to be the most batter-friendly that England will experience, with Australia's 326 there against New Zealand the highest total of this World Cup.

While England's batters struggled against spin against Bangladesh in Guwahati, they are not alone.

Australia's extraordinary batting depth saved them from what would have been a mind-blowing defeat by Pakistan, recovering from 76-7 to post 221-9 in Colombo, but England have also proved they have a well-rounded attack for the surfaces.

Spinners Linsey Smith, Sophie Ecclestone, Charlie Dean and Alice Capsey have been superb, taking 16 wickets between them. 

The contest for the top four places in the eight-team group was blown wide open by South Africa's astonishing comeback against India on Thursday, led by Nadine de Klerk's unbeaten 84 from number eight.

"I know Nadine quite well, having played with her at the Blaze," Beaumont said.

"She's an absolute fighter and a competitor, so it doesn't surprise me that she pulled that out of the bag.

"It's great to see that any team in this competition can beat anyone, but I think that kind of batting depth will be the difference between the top four and the rest."

Nat Sciver-Brunt's England are the only unbeaten team after defending champions Australia's match against Sri Lanka was washed out.

The International Cricket Council has said India's fixture against Australia on Sunday will be a sell-out, alongside India v England, although there have been mostly disappointing crowds for games not involving India.

"Indian fans are so passionate about cricket, we know that they're going to come out to support their team. But it will be amazing to play in front of a sold-out crowd," said Beaumont.

Beaumont, who has scores of 21 not out and 13 at this World Cup, said overcoming a wobble against Bangladesh will serve England well.

Over the past year they have been criticised for not performing under pressure after T20 World Cup and Ashes defeats, and, had they not got over the line in Guwahati, it would have been one of the biggest shocks in Women's World Cup history.

"We like to keep it exciting sometimes," Beaumont said.

"But it's given us really good belief. We know the blueprint of how we want to play, so we are calm and well prepped.

"There's absolute faith in the whole batting order. The fact that the two best partnerships came from Heather Knight and the batters at seven and eight was outstanding."

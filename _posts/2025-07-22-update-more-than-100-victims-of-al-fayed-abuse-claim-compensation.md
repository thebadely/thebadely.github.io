According to new developments, More than 100 victims of Mohamed Al Fayed's abuse have entered a compensation scheme opened by Harrods on 31 March, the luxury department store has confirmed.

Harrods started issuing compensation at the end of April and the scheme remains open for new applications until 31 March 2026.

Eligibility for the scheme has been extended to employees of one of Fayed's private airline companies, Fayair (Jersey) Co Ltd, Harrods said.

Harrods also said that it has filed a case at the High Court asking for the executors of Fayed's estate to be replaced following the lack of "any progress" in resolving his affairs since he died in 2023.

This is to "ensure the Estate is responsibly administered, [and to] to protect any assets in the Estate for the benefit of potential claimants", Harrods said.

The BBC has contacted representatives of the Fayed family for comment.

Harrods also said that "feedback from survivors continues to be listened to whether raised directly or via legal firms or Dame Jasvinder Sanghera, the Independent Survivor Advocate".

Multiple women who worked for the former department store owner who died last year have accused him of rape and sexual assault.

In March Harrods said victims of abuse by the former Harrods owner could receive up to £385,000 in compensation plus treatment costs if they agree to be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist. 

Harrods said individuals can apply for different compensation amounts, including General Damages of up to £200,000 and a Work Impact Payment sum of up to £150,000.

Many of those who say Fayed abused them underwent intrusive medical examinations when they were hired. Compensation for such testing could be up to £10,000.

Past treatment costs will also be covered.

The redress scheme outlines different pathways for survivors to receive compensation depending on whether or not they are medically assessed - something which can impact to the amount they receive.

Harrods previously stated an eligible applicant does not need to have been a Harrods' employee, but their claim must contain a "sufficiently close connection".

Those who allege they were assaulted outside the UK "in circumstances that are sufficiently connected" to Fayed's role at Harrods could also be eligible for compensation.

All eligible applicants are offered a meeting with a senior Harrods' representative, to receive an apology in person or by video, as well as an individual written apology.

The scheme only requires "documentary evidence", meaning applicants are not asked to give oral evidence regarding their claims.

If a person makes a successful application and accepts an offer, it is treated as "full and final settlement", meaning they waive their right to pursue further action for damages.

The BBC's Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-employees at Harrods who said Fayed sexually assaulted or raped them.

Dozens more women sent the BBC their accounts of abuse by Fayed including sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape after the documentary and podcast were published in September.

The documentary and podcast found that during Fayed's ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene but helped cover up abuse allegations.

Responding to the investigation at the time, Harrods' current owners said they were "utterly appalled" by the allegations and that his victims had been failed - for which the store sincerely apologised.

Fayed was not charged before his death.

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Canada v Wales

Venue: Salford Community Stadium Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two from 11.45 (BBC One in Wales), BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport online, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds.

Wales know they will have to cause a major upset if they are to keep their World Cup hopes alive this weekend.

They take on a giant of the women's game in Canada, ranked second in the world and a team they have not beaten in almost 20 years.

Not many people are giving them a hope, especially after last weekend's dismal display against Scotland.

Wales have come out with fighting talk this week - after all they have nothing to lose, they already have one foot on the bus home. 

Their chances of making the quarter-finals are hanging by a thread, with Canada and Scotland very much in the driving seat to progress from Pool B.

But Wales do not plan on going out quietly - they have been told to be brave and, at the very least, restore some pride back in the shirt.

Wales make sweeping changes for must-win Canada game

Scotland yet to peak before Fiji test - Easson

Wales head coach Sean Lynn has stayed true to his word in basing selection on performance.

"If you're not performing, you're out", he said ruthlessly at the team announcement.

He has made seven starting changes, six of which coming in the pack as Wales aim to get their set piece back on track and match Canada physically.

Maisie Davies, Molly Reardon and Sisilia Tuipulotu make up a front row with an average age of just 20, while the experienced Abbie Fleming is back at lock.

Georgia Evans re-takes her favoured position of number eight, while Bryonie King gets a rare start in the back row. Carys Cox, a standout player in the Six Nations, is the only change among the backs.

Co-captains Alex Callender and Kate Williams are both missing after picking up knocks against Scotland, which means Bethan Lewis will lead the side out for the first time on her 60th cap.

It will also be a special day for Gwenllian Pyrs who wins her 50th, although she must settle for a place on the bench alongside Wales Under-20s captain Branwen Metcalfe who will look to join older sister Nel on the field for her first cap.

Canada have also made changes. Head coach Kevin Rouet arguably put out his B side in their 11-try victory over against Fiji, while this week he has gone full strength.

McKinley Hunt and Emily Tuttosi are both promoted from the bench to start in the front row, while Karen Paquin is set for her fourth World Cup appearance in the back row.

Tyson Beukeboom comes in at lock and by winning her 80th cap she will equal Aaron Carpenter's record as the most-capped Canadian rugby player in history.

Asia Hogan-Rochester completes the changes on the wing, making her Rugby World Cup debut and her first appearance for Canada since suffering an injury against New Zealand earlier this year.

Wales head coach Sean Lynn said there were some "tough conversations" during their Scotland review, but credited the players for their reaction.

"We need to make sure that we are training like we want to be playing and that's what we've done this week and each individual is trying to get better over their opposite number.

"Canada are a very good side, second in the world. They love the offloading game, and they've got very good athletes in the forward pack and also in the back line. 

"When there is an opportunity with these breakdowns, you've got to be really physical. We didn't have that physicality, we just need to make sure defensively we are making the most in our one-on-one tackles."

Showing faith with the youngsters in his squad, Lynn added: "If I'm asking the players to be brave, then I'd be brave with it as well. Those individuals, even though they are 18, have been training and performing very well."

Wales captain Bethan Lewis backs her side to come out fighting this weekend

Canada head coach Kevin Rouet was pleased with last weekend's performance but is wary of a wounded Wales.

"We are starting to have rhythm so it's good to see that. People know their role now, if you're starting, finishing or there to prepare for the weekend,â he said.

"It was a smooth week of preparation and we know what we need to face an angry Welsh team after their first game, so we will prepare for that.

"We have to expect a lot of fight, Wales is never an easy game for us, it's always an 80-minute grind so we are prepared for the threat. 

"They have said it is like a final for them so you never know what you could expect from that. We just have to be confident with who we are and our preparation, go with the game plan. We expect a lot from them and they need to expect a lot from us."

Wales have nothing to lose against Canada - Jones

BBC Radio Wales commentator Nick Webb said: "This feels like an Everest-scale challenge for Wales after the lacklustre opening against Scotland, with a few established names left on the sidelines either by choice or through injury. 

"The hope will be that this side produces more accuracy and aggression upfront, and shows more shape behind than last week's 15.

"It's a young front row, and there's less experience than usual in the back row, while it will be hoped teenage replacements Tilly Vucaj and Branwen Metcalfe show the fearlessness of youth in what could be an early changing of the guard for the Wales squad.

"There are fewer options behind the scrum, with only 13 backs chosen for the tournament, but Carys Cox has the chance to become a first choice as long-term skipper Hannah Dallavalle (formerly Jones) misses out.

"As for Canada, second ranking in the world speaks for itself, before you get to an unbeaten record this year. The pace and precision they showed wide out against Fiji will have to be smothered somehow.

"So Wales will need an exceptional improvement to win in Salford, but it should not be difficult to produce a more spirited display to set themselves up for a closing victory over Fiji."

Gwen Crabb says Wales are excited by the challenge of Canada 

Canada have won each of their last seven games against Wales, with each of those victories coming by 15+ points. Wales' last win against the Canucks came in May 2006 (16-11)

Wales and Canada have met four times previously at the Rugby World Cup, they drew their first meeting in 1991 (9-9) with Wales winning three years later (11-5). However, the Canucks have won their two meetings since then, both in 2017 without conceding a single point (15-0 in the Pool stage, 52-0 in the play-offs)

Canada retained possession from 89 of their 90 attacking rucks against Fiji, with their 98.9% ruck success rate being the best of any nation in the opening round of fixtures at Rugby World Cup 2025

Wales won eight turnovers against Scotland, with each of those turnovers coming at the breakdown â no other side won more than five turnovers at the ruck in the opening round of Rugby World Cup 2025.

Canada full-back Julia Schell scored six tries against Fiji, the most by any player in a Rugby World Cup match since New Zealand's Portia Woodman-Wickliffe scored eight against Hong Kong China in 2017.

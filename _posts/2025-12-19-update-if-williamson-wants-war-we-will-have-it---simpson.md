Watch Simpson's top knockouts

Callum Simpson said Troy Williamson "will have a war if he wants it" as both  fighters made weight before Saturday's British, European and Commonwealth super-middleweight showdown in Leeds.

Simpson, 29, tipped the scales at 11st 13lb 11oz (75.9kg) while Williamson came in slightly lighter at 11st 13lb 6oz (75.8kg). 

Simpson, undefeated after 18 fights, is putting his super-middleweight titles on the line at the First Direct Arena against Williamson, who has 21 wins, four losses and one draw on his record. 

"[Williamson] can have it any way he wants," said Simpson, who turned professional in 2019. 

"He's been wearing a hat all week saying 'war' on it. If he wants a war, we will have a war. Whatever he wants, he can get it.

"But I am going to be winning no matter what. I'm not coming just to defend but to dominate. I want to show that I'm above this level." 

Simpson climbed off the canvas twice to secure a stunning stoppage win over Ivan Zucco in his hometown of Barnsley in June. 

Asked what he saw in Simpson's eyes when they faced off, Darlington fighter Williamson said: "Just a guy that's in my way that I need to take care of."

Simpson is expected to bring a large following across Yorkshire from Barnsley for the fight, but Williamson said he is unfazed by the support for his opponent. 

"The fans can't win the fight," the 34-year-old added. 

"They can make as much noise as they want. But it's only me, him and the referee in the ring. That's all that matters." 

Saturday's card will be broadcast live on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer.

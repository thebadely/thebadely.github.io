According to new developments, Scotland beat Switzerland 8-5 to reach the final

Scotland fell short in their quest for gold at the European Curling Championships as Rebecca Morrison's rink were beaten 7-5 in the final by Sweden.

Team Morrison - bronze medallists last year and ranked second in the competition - lost four of their first six matches in Finland but then won four on the spin, including their semi-final against Switzerland, to set up the match against Anna Hasselborg's rink.

The Swedes had already beaten Scotland in the round robin and never trailed in the final, seizing control with twos in the fifth and seventh ends.

Morrison, Jen Dodds, Sophie Sinclair and Sophie Jackson needed a three to force an extra end, but only managed one and had to settle for silver.

Scotland's men beat Joel Retornaz's Italy 9-3 in Friday's third-place play-off after losing in their semi-final against Sweden, with former world champion Niklas Edin going on to secure a golden double by edging Yannick Schwaller' Swiss 5-4 in the men's final.

Women's skip Jackson said: "If you'd told us we were going to come away with a silver medal at the start of the week we'd have been pretty happy.

"Obviously, it's a tough one to take being in that final and not finishing the week off on a win, but we're still delighted with the performances we put in.

"We've got a couple of months before the Olympics now where we can just try to dissect the first half of the week in particular, but also take the positives from the latter part of it and look to replicate that in February."

Jackson revealed it had been an especially challenging week for her personally after the death of her grandfather midway through the competition.

"I'd seen him in the hospital a couple of weeks before we headed out here, though, and he was telling his nurses how it was very important to turn on the TV and watch us in the European Championships, so I know he'll have been watching us from up there and he'll have been very, very proud," she said.

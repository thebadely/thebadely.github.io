Experts revealed that Arbeloa played for Liverpool (2007-2009) and West Ham (2016-2017) during his career

Real Madrid boss Alvaro Arbeloa has called on fans for their support and says he is "focused on finding solutions" following Wednesday's shock Copa del Rey defeat by Albacete.

It was Arbeloa's first game in charge after he replaced Xabi Alonso on Monday.

On Saturday, Real host Levante, who currently sit second from bottom in the league, as they try and close the four-point gap on leaders Barcelona.

After losing to Albacete, who sit 17th in the Spanish second division, Real captain Dani Carvajal admitted that the team had reached "rock bottom". 

"I understand that people are looking for someone to blame, but I'm focused on finding solutions," said Arbeloa.

"When things aren't going well, it's because I need to help my players better. I feel very responsible for what happens on the field."

Despite the disappointment, Arbeloa insisted he would not rethink his approach to the defeat at Albacete.

"I wouldn't change a single thing," said the 42-year-old.

"The past doesn't matter. Every failure I've had has made me improve, made me ask questions. Failures bring you closer to where you want to go."

Looking ahead, Arbeloa was clear about the type of Real Madrid he wants supporters to see with midfielder Jude Bellingham playing an important role.

"We've trained for a couple of days and up close you realise even more what kind of player he is, the talent he has," Arbeloa said of the 22-year-old England international. 

"He has to be another of the leaders of this team. He has the ability to create, build and that is what I am going to ask of him. 

"The most important thing is that he goes out on the pitch and is clear about what he has to do and that transcendence and personality is reflected in the team's game.

"I want a team that goes out to win from minute one, with no doubt that we're going for the opponent's goal. I want a team that shows passion and enthusiasm."

And the former Liverpool and West Ham defender is clear that he will shoulder the blame for any shortcomings from his side.

"What happened in Albacete was a lack of play, fitness and everything else, and I'm responsible for that," he said. 

"There will only be one person responsible and that person is the current coach of Real Madrid.

"I respect the fans' opinion and understand they're hurt, but I ask for their support.

"In 123 years of history, great titles have been achieved when the Bernabeu has been with its players".

Let's dive into the details: Lindsey Vonn had a titanium prosthesis fitted to her right knee during her time away from the sport

American Lindsey Vonn says she will be "in a good place" for the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics after claiming a podium spot for the fourth time in five World Cup races.

The 41-year-old, who last week became the oldest downhill World Cup winner, finished third in the super-G in Val d'Isere on Sunday to clinch her 142nd World Cup podium finish.

Vonn, who had not raced at the French Alps resort for eight years before this weekend, crossed the line in one minute 20.60 seconds - 0.36secs behind winner Sofia Goggia of Italy, with New Zealand's Alice Robinson finishing second.

"I didn't quite have enough direction on the first jump," Vonn said. "After that, I skied well. I'm happy with my skiing today, unlike in the super-G in St Moritz, where I was too conservative.

"I know where I made mistakes and I know where it is costing me."

It was her second podium finish at Val d'Isere after finishing third in the downhill on Saturday, behind winner Cornelia Huetter of Austria and second-placed Kira Weidle-Winkelmann of Germany.

Vonn retired from the sport in February 2019 because of injury but made her competitive return in December 2024 following a partial knee replacement.

There are 47 days to go until the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, which run from 6-22 February.

She already has one gold and two bronze Olympic medals to her name and is on track to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.

"In Cortina, I will be in a good place," Vonn said.

Meanwhile, she is also hoping to add to the four World Cup titles she has gathered over a career that has spanned 20 years.

She is currently 69 points clear at the top of the overall downhill standings and ranked fifth in the overall super-G standings.

This season's World Cup campaign includes a total of nine races taking place before the finals at Kvitfjell in Norway on 21 March 2026.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The directors of Moorcroft Pottery have announced that the firm has stopped trading after more than 100 years.

In a post on social media on Wednesday, bosses at the Stoke-on-Trent firm, based in Burslem, said they have told insolvency business Moore Recovery to help with voluntarily liquidating the company.

They said Moore would contact creditors in due course but did not give an explanation for the firm's closure.

Moorcroft had warned in March of possible redundancies and at the time cited rising costs and falling sales.

The firm traces its roots back to 1897 and has been based at its current site in Sandbach Road since 1913.

According to its website, the firm's founder William Moorcroft was able to produce pottery from its current site thanks to the support of London department store Liberty.

After winning a number of prestigious international awards, Moorcroft was appointed as Potter to HM The Queen in 1928.

The firm's royal patronage continued when the late Queen Elizabeth II added Moorcroft designs into the Royal Collection.

The brand was also popular with US presidents and British prime ministers, according to the firm.

The news of Moorcroft's collapse is the latest blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent.

In February, Royal Stafford, also based in Burslem, called in administrators.

The firm's collapse followed the closure of Dudson in 2019, Wade in Longton two years ago and Johnsons Tiles in 2024.

City council leader Jane Ashworth said Moorcroft had been a major part of Stoke-on-Trent's heritage in ceramics.

"Our teams have been working closely and intensively with Moorcroft to try to find a solution but unfortunately this has not been possible," she said.

"The fact is global and national headwinds - including high energy prices and a rash of cheap, illegal forgeries from overseas - have made life very difficult for manufacturers.

"We have lobbied - and will continue to lobby - the government to provide specific support for this vital and valuable sector."

She added the authority would provide support for affected employees to help them find new jobs.

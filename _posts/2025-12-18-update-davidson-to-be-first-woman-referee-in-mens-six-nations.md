Experts revealed that Hollie Davidson has refereed two Women's World Cup finals

Scotland's Hollie Davidson will become the first woman to referee a men's Six Nations match when Ireland host Italy on 14 February.

The 33-year-old is no stranger to landmark achievements, having become Scottish Rugby's first full-time female referee in 2017 and the first woman to referee a New Zealand Test in November, when they beat Wales 52-26 in Cardiff.

Davidson has officiated two Women's World Cup finals, as well as the 2025 European Challenge Cup final between Bath and Lyon.

As well as taking charge of the Ireland v Italy clash, she will also be one of the assistant referees for the final match of the 2026 Six Nations when France host England in Paris on 14 March.

Davidson said: "Refereeing in the Guinness Six Nations is a massive honour and a match I'm really looking forward to.

"The last year has been very memorable and I'm focused on continuing to perform well. 

"To be the first woman to referee in the tournament is obviously a proud moment and an achievement I'll properly be able to reflect on in years to come."

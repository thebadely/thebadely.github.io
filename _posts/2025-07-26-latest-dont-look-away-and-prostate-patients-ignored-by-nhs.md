Experts revealed that The Mirror devotes its front page to a photograph of a mother in Gaza holding a starving child - with a headline which pleads: 'Don't Look Away.' The Daily Mail has interviewed the freed British-Israeli hostage, Emily Danari.

The Times reports that the prime minister's reluctance to recognise a Palestinian state is likely to deepen divisions within the Cabinet. The Daily Telegraph says his deputy, Angela Rayner, is among the ministers "piling pressure" on him to take the step. The Guardian leads on growing political pressure for the UK to recognise Palestine as a state.  

The Telegraph's main story is on a campaign by the paper for targeted screening for prostate cancer. It warns that thousands of men are not being diagnosed quickly enough - and says Health Secretary Wes Streeting has praised its demand for better care.

The Sun carries what it calls a tearful interview with the former Masterchef presenter, Gregg Wallace, who was sacked by the BBC after a report upheld 45 allegations about his behaviour. He tells the newspaper he is not a groper, sex pest or a flasher - and says he is "so sorry" to anyone he hurt. He also backs his former Masterchef colleague, John Torode - who has also left the programme.

County lines gangs are switching from dealing drugs to snatching phones, according to the front page of the The Mail. It says the change is due to demand from overseas for the devices, and softer sentences for those caught stealing them. The paper says the thefts have become an epidemic - worth Â£70 million a year - and quotes a police chief who says tech firms should apply kill switches to make stolen mobiles useless.

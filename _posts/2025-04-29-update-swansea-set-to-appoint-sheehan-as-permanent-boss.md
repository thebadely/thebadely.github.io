It has been recently reported that Alan Sheehan has taken 34 points from 19 games across two spells as Swansea's caretaker boss

Swansea City are set to appoint Alan Sheehan as their permanent head coach following his successful spell as caretaker boss.

Sheehan, 38, has impressed since taking charge in mid-February following the departure of Luke Williams.

Swansea had relegation concerns when Williams left the club on the back of a run of seven defeats in nine Championship matches. 

But Sheehan's side are now guaranteed to finish in the top half of the table having taken 23 points from the Irishman's 12 games at the helm.

Sheehan was initially put in charge for five matches before he agreed in March to remain at the helm for the remainder of the season.

Speaking after last Saturday's defeat at Millwall, Sheehan confirmed talks had taken place over a long-term contract and said a decision on his future would be made this week. 

He has always been interested in taking the role on a long-term basis, though he has repeatedly stressed that his ideas on the way forward must align with the club's vision.

A former coach at Luton Town and Southampton, Sheehan joined Swansea as an assistant head coach in the summer 2023.

Having initially been part of Michael Duff's backroom staff, Sheehan first took over as caretaker boss in December 2023, when he helped Swansea claim 11 points from seven matches before the appointment of Williams in January last year.

Sheehan returned to the backroom team before stepping up to the top job for a second time when Williams said his farewells.

At the time, Swansea were eight points clear of the bottom three in 17th, but they have since delivered a remarkable upturn in form to climb to 11th in the table.

After the Millwall loss ended Swansea's very faint play-off chances, they finish the season with a home game against Oxford United on Saturday (12:30 BST).

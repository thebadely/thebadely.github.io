Let's dive into the details: BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton already has enough on his plate trying to get the better of AI at predictions, but now he has a WWE superstar on his case too.

Newly crowned WWE world champion Drew McIntyre, a Rangers fan, has clashed with former Celtic striker Sutton in the past over their Old Firm allegiances.

We would love to see them meet in the wrestling ring but, for now, they will attempt to outdo each other - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to pick the right results for the weekend's 10 Premier League matches.

Drew will make his predictions on Friday and we'll bring them to you. Do you agree with Sutton's scores? You can pick your own below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Drew celebrates winning the WWE Championship during SmackDown at Uber Arena in Berlin last weekend. He became the first British and only Scottish world champion in WWE history when he first won the belt in 2020.

McIntyre is in the UK for the WWE Live Road to Royal Rumble Tour, which continues in Newcastle on Thursday, and you can watch each event on Netflix.

He landed the WWE world crown for the third time in Berlin last week, but his latest success did not impress Sutton too much.

"Drew is getting on a bit now," Sutton said. "Is he really world champion again at his age?

"Fair play to him for winning it but if he wants to fight me when he's over here then I'd probably give him a tougher test than the people he beat to get his belt.

"Honestly, I reckon I would cause him a problem or two. He's all dumbbells and muscles - I've got the greater all-round core strength... and more brains as well.

"But, let's face it, he has to win things himself because his football club don't win a lot."

Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.

Drew first challenged Chris to meet him in the ring in 2020, leading Chris to begin training to become a wrestling star... he managed to find a suitable outfit, although he did avoid the actual fight

Old Trafford, 12:30 GMT

Well, I know who is going to win this. I'm just not sure about the score.

What on earth is going on at Manchester United? It just seems like they are making it up as they go along.

I don't get the thinking at Old Trafford, so I'm probably wrong here, but it looks to me like they are waiting to try to get England boss Thomas Tuchel in the summer, or maybe even United States manager Mauricio Pochettino - who could also be free after the World Cup.

In the meantime, here we are with United treading water again. It would have been interesting if Darren Fletcher had won the two games when he was manager - would he still be in charge?

We will have to see how caretaker boss Michael Carrick lines United up - whether he plays with a back four and what shape he will use - but I don't see it making much difference against Manchester City.

I was at St James' Park on Tuesday and City were really comfortable against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup. That was the first time I've seen Rayan Cherki in the flesh and when he came on you could tell what an intelligent footballer he is.

Erling Haaland has only scored once, a penalty, in his past six games and he did not get on the scoresheet when City scored 10 against Exeter in the FA Cup.

So he is due a goal, and he usually gets at least one against United - he has scored eight in six league games against them - so they need to find a way of stopping him this time.

This is such a tough start for Carrick. I am going to give United a goal for their fans to get excited about, but City will still take the points pretty easily.

Sutton's prediction: 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Stamford Bridge, 15:00

Liam Rosenior's Chelsea looked a bit like Enzo Maresca's Chelsea against Arsenal, with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez playing out from the back.

It seems they have got a new manager who is going to play the same way as their old one, but is Rosenior going to be a stickler for doing it at all costs the way Maresca was?

It finished 2-2 when these sides met earlier in the season, and it will be close this time too.

Brentford are on such a good run that has seem them climb to fifth, three places above Chelsea, but I still fancy the Blues at Stamford Bridge even though they have only won one of their past five games there.

Rosenior was without several players through injury, illness and suspension against the Gunners, but he will be hoping to have a few of them back for this one.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Elland Road, 15:00

Leeds lost out to a bizarre stoppage-time own goal at Craven Cottage in September, but they look a different team now - they have come on so much.

Mind you, so have Fulham. The only time Harry Wilson has failed to score recently is when I put him in my Fantasy team, and while I thought they would struggle when some of their players went to the Africa Cup of Nations, the opposite has happened - they have been excellent.

I'd usually back Leeds to win at home, but Fulham have proved they can nick a goal and a result on the road so I am going to sit on the fence here.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Anfield, 15:00

Burnley have picked up three draws in their past five league games so they have not given up the fight against the drop, but they have now gone 12 league games without a win and you have to think they have had it.

You still don't really know what kind of performance you are going to get from Liverpool, and they huffed and puffed a little bit to get past Barnsley in the FA Cup, but I am still going to back them here.

Liverpool needed a stoppage-time Mohamed Salah penalty to win at Turf Moor in September, but I can see it being a lot more comfortable for Arne Slot's side this time.

I remember when Burnley boss Scott Parker lost 9-0 with Bournemouth at Anfield in 2022, and he was sacked the next day.

I don't see his side shipping as many goals this time, but Parker is going to be under pressure until the Clarets win again. Maybe that will happen when they are at home to Tottenham next week, because they are not getting anything here.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Stadium of Light, 15:00

Crystal Palace have not won any of their past nine games in all competitions, and their FA Cup defeat at Macclesfield was a huge embarrassment.

Eagles boss Oliver Glasner made changes for that tie which did not work, and the squad depth is clearly not there to cope with this busy time of the season.

Looking at Sunderland's results, they were not exactly in great form either before they beat Everton in a penalty shootout to reach round four.

The Black Cats are without a win in five league games but the difference with Palace is that they drew four of them and, importantly, they also played well in most of those matches too.

Regis le Bris's side have been so strong at home that, along with Palace's poor form, I really have to back them here.

As their fans keep on pointing out, I've not done too well at predicting Sunderland scores this season, but I will get one of their results right soon... surely!

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00

They are calling this 'El Sackio', because both managers are under so much pressure.

Tottenham's home form is miserable, with two wins in 10 league games, and there is so much angst amongst their fans at the moment.

Similarly, West Ham's players are probably better off away from home right now because of the animosity from their supporters inside their own stadium, but their away record is just as atrocious with only one win in 10.

This is one of those games where I like to wheel out one of my favourite sayings in football - these two teams have been so bad recently that they both could lose.

It's certainly hard to make a case for either of them to win it. I am going to go with Spurs, because new signing Conor Gallagher has plenty of energy and will add some thrust and drive to their midfield.

But it's a lot easier to predict that it will be a dismal game, with Tottenham booed off after a bang-average performance that means Thomas Frank is still under pressure despite winning.

As for Hammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo, he is just going to be in even greater danger of getting the sack.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

City Ground, 17:30

Nottingham Forest are out of the FA Cup, but by far their biggest result last week was their win at relegation rivals West Ham to end a four-game losing streak in the league.

I don't see Sean Dyche's side getting anything here, though. They lost their two previous home games, against Manchester City and Everton, and Arsenal will make it a hat-trick of home defeats.

This is the sort of game that Mikel Arteta's side seem to know how to win. It might be close, but I'd still back the Gunners to find a way.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

AI's prediction: 1-3

Molineux, 14:00

This is a tough one to call because Wolves will feel like they have a little bit of momentum at last, while I am wondering where Newcastle will get their energy from - and how many fit players they have got left.

Wolves are three games unbeaten in the league, including their first win of the season against West Ham, and they even looked like they were enjoying themselves when they beat Shrewsbury in the FA Cup - that has not happened very often at Molineux recently.

Newcastle have got a few players out, with Jacob Murphy the latest to be injured in their Carabao Cup defeat by Manchester City in midweek.

Eddie Howe's side have climbed to sixth on the back of three straight league wins, but after this they have a huge Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday - so it will be interesting to see what team he picks here.

Every game is important for Newcastle, but Howe will need to rest some players at some point. If he does it here, it could cost them. I've changed my mind a few times about the outcome of this one, but I am going to go for a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Villa Park, 16:30

It must be such a wonderful time to be an Aston Villa fan - they have been on an incredible run and their one defeat in their past 15 games, at Arsenal at the end of the year, has not affected their confidence.

Villa drew 0-0 at Everton at the start of the season, but their form has picked up a lot since then - they have stacks of belief, and they have lots of goals in them too.

Everton will have Jack Grealish back from suspension to face his old club, which is a boost for them and him.

David Moyes certainly won't make it easy for Villa, but I'm still expecting them to win.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Amex Stadium, 20:00

Antoine Semenyo is a huge big miss for Bournemouth now he has joined Manchester City, but they are still an attack-minded team and I always fancy them to score.

Brighton are the same, in that they look dangerous when they come forward but can also appear very open.

So, this should be a very entertaining game and we should see a few goals too. I just can't pick a winner.

Sutton's prediction: 2-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

Chris correctly picked the winner in 21 of the 31 third-round ties to have been played so far - Salford versus Swindon was postponed and takes place next week.

He got the better of his guest, DJ and producer Shadow Child, who started strongly before going for a few too many shocks - and ended up with 16 correct predictions.

AI did better by avoiding predicting pretty much any surprise results whatsoever, for a score of 22, but it is the BBC readers who lead the way as things stand, with a tally of 23.

Unsurprisingly, Chris, Shadow Child, AI and most of you lot did not see Macclesfield's amazing victory over Crystal Palace coming... BUT out of 25,000 predictions, more than 1,200 of you did back the Silkmen. Well done to whoever got that one right.

"Humans go for shocks and excitement - AI needs to get a life," Sutton said. "It needs to stop number crunching and get itself down the pub."

Chris got four correct results from the 10 midweek Premier League matches in week 21 [which took place 6-8 January] with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.

That was enough to beat the BBC readers, who got two correct results with no exact scores, giving them 20 points.

AI did a bit better, with four correct scores including one exact result, meaning it ended up on 70 points.

But for the second successive week, the win went to Chris' guest. Tony McGuinness of electronic dance music group Above and Beyond got five correct results with one exact score, for a tally of 80 points.

England win final T20 against Windies to complete clean sweep

England head coach Charlotte Edwards has confirmed that captain Nat Sciver-Brunt is unlikely to bowl this summer. 

All-rounder Sciver-Brunt, 32, has been recovering from a long-standing Achilles problem which worsened during England's thrashing by Australia in the Women's Ashes at the start of the year.

She subsequently played a starring role in Mumbai Indians' Women's Premier League win but had a long period of rehabilitation afterwards, which coincided with her maternity leave. 

Sciver-Brunt was appointed England captain last month, shortly after her wife, former England bowler Katherine, gave birth to their son in March.

"I feel these games are really big for us," Edwards told Sky Sports after England started her and Sciver-Brunt's reign with a comprehensive T20 series clean sweep against West Indies. 

"We've got nine games before the World Cup starts, so a lot of this is about us getting the right balance of team.

"Nat's not bowling this series and she's probably not going to bowl most of the summer. We want to make sure she's fit and firing for the World Cup. 

"Her workloads will start in a few weeks. It gives her an opportunity to look at other options, so we know we've got that balance if and when Nat comes back." 

England face West Indies in three one-day internationals starting at Derby on Friday, followed by a T20 and an ODI series against India across June and July.

But Edwards and Sciver-Brunt's first major assignment comes in the autumn, with India hosting the 50-over World Cup.

Edwards also praised the new or returning faces in England's T20 squad, including seamers Em Arlott - who made her international debut in the first match at Canterbury and ended the series with six wickets - and Issy Wong, who had been out of the side for a couple of years after a dip in form. 

Sophie Ecclestone, the world's number one-ranked bowler, was left out of the side to regain fitness after a knee issue but her fellow left-arm spinner Linsey Smith also performed well, taking three wickets at a miserly economy of 4.83 across the three matches.

"With Em Arlott, we've all seen her in domestic cricket and how good she's been but to come here and look at ease in international cricket in her first few games is really pleasing," added Edwards. 

"And Linsey Smith is a proven performer and probably unlucky to be around at the same time as Sophie Ecclestone. She's taken her opportunity with both hands and that's all you can do.

"And Lauren Bell was unbelievable today, you can see the competition forming. It's an exciting time. 

"Mahika Gaur and Kate Cross are coming back into the ODI team. We've suddenly got this battery of fast bowlers forming which is going to give me a few headaches, but good headaches."

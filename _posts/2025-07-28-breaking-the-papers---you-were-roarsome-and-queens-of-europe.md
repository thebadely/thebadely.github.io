According to new developments, England's European Championship victory commands the front pages.

The Lionesses are the "Queen's of Europe", according to the i Paper.

With the headline "Revenge of the Lionesses", The Times recalls England's defeat to Spain in the final of the women's World Cup, two years ago.

For the Guardian, the penalty shootout was the "final twist of what will surely be remembered as one of the most magnificent heists in the history of English sport".

In the Daily Mirror, a range of emotions are shown across the faces of the Prince of Wales and his daughter Princess Charlotte, as they cheered on the team from the stands - under the caption: Eng-GIRL-land.

"Golden girl Chloe" is how the Daily Mail describes the winning penalty scorer, Chloe Kelly, showing her lying in a bed of sparkling confetti, beside Michelle Agyemang.

The Sun highlights the performance of the goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, noting that she saved two penalties in the shootout - under the headline, "The Hann of God".

"It's home again," declares the Daily Star, featuring a photo of the team celebrating in a shower of golden ticker tape, holding up the trophy, beside the caption: "WIN-gerland." 

The Metro's message to the players is: "You were roarsome."

The papers also devote space to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with the Mirror noting that Sir Keir Starmer will be visiting Donald Trump at his golf course at Turnberry - and pushing him to "tee up" a ceasefire.

The Times says Sir Keir will "prioritise" the issue - but notes that while both men want a truce, there are questions over whether they can steer the people who matter in the direction of peace.

The Daily Telegraph says two Jewish comedians - Rachel Creeger and Philip Simon - have had shows cancelled at the Edinburgh Fringe, citing concerns about safety.

According to new developments, Bereaved families are calling for a public inquiry into what they say are "repeated failures" by the UK government to protect vulnerable people from a website promoting suicide.

A report by the Molly Rose Foundation says departments were warned 65 times about the online forum, which BBC News is not naming, and others like it but did not act.

The suicide prevention charity says at least 133 people have died in the UK as a result of a toxic chemical promoted by the site and similar forums.

The government has not said whether it will consider an inquiry but said sites must prevent users from accessing illegal suicide and self-harm content or face "robust enforcement, including substantial fines".

Families and survivors have written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer asking him for an inquiry to look into why warnings from coroners and campaigners have been ignored.

David Parfett, whose son Tom took his own life in 2021, told the BBC successive governments had offered sympathy but no accountability.

"The people who host the suicide platforms to spread their cult-like messages that suicide is normal - and earn money from selling death - continue to be several steps ahead of government ministers and law enforcement bodies," he said.

"I can think of no better memorial for my son than knowing people like him are protected from harm while they recover their mental health."

David and six other families are being represented by the law firm Leigh Day who have also written a letter to the prime minister highlighting their concerns about the main suicide forum.

The letter says victims were groomed online, and tended to be in their early 20s, with the youngest known victim being 13.

It argues a public inquiry is needed because coroners' courts cannot institute the changes needed to protect vulnerable people.

According to the report, coroners raised concerns and sent repeated warnings to the Home Office, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and Department of Health and Social Care on dozens of occasions since 2019, when the forum that has been criticised by the families first emerged.

The report highlighted four main findings: 

A government spokesperson said that the substance in question "is closely monitored and is reportable under the Poisons Act" meaning retailers should tell the authorities if they suspect it is being bought to cause harm. 

But campaigners say the government's response has been fragmented and slow, with officials "passing the parcel" rather than taking co-ordinated action.

Adele Zeynep Walton, whose sister Aimee died in 2022, said families like hers had been "ignored and dismissed".

"She was creative, a very talented artist, gifted musician," she told BBC News.

"Aimee was hardworking and achieved great GCSE results, however she was shy and quiet and struggled to make friends.

"Every time I learn of a new life lost to the website that killed my sister three years ago, I'm infuriated that another family has had to go through this preventable tragedy."

The demand for an inquiry follows concerns raised by the BBC in 2023, when an investigation revealed sites offering instructions and encouragement for suicide and evading regulations.

Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, said the state's failure to act had "cost countless lives".

He also accused Ofcom of being "inexplicably slow" to restrict UK access to the main website the Foundation has raised concerns about.

Under the Online Safety Act, which became law in October 2023, Ofcom got the power in March 2025 to take action against sites hosting illegal content, which includes assisting suicide. If sites fail to show they have systems in place to remove illegal material, Ofcom can block them or impose fines of up to Â£18m.

UK users are currently unable to access the forum, which is based in the US. A message on the forum's homepage says it was not blocked to people in the UK as a result of government action but instead because of a "proactive" decision to "protect the platform and its users".

"We operate under the protection of the First Amendment. However, UK authorities have signalled intentions to enforce their domestic laws on foreign platforms, potentially leading to criminal liability or service disruption," the message reads.

In a statement, Ofcom said: "In response to our enforcement action, the online suicide forum put in place a geo-block to restrict access by people with UK IP addresses.

"Services that choose to block access by people in the UK must not encourage or promote ways to avoid these restrictions."

It added the forum remained on its watchlist and a previously-launched investigation into it remained open while it checked the block was being maintained.

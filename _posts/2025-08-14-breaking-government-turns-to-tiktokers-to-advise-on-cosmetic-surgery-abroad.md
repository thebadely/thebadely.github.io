According to new developments, The government is partnering with TikTok influencers to warn people about the risks of travelling abroad for cosmetic procedures.

There's growing concern over the rise in Britons seeking overseas treatments such as hair implants and dental work, often lured by lower costs and shorter waiting times.

Medical content creators will urge viewers to talk to a UK doctor first, take out specialist travel insurance and avoid package holidays that include procedures.

The move is part of a wider government campaign to curb so-called medical tourism, as well as tighten regulations for cosmetic practitioners in England.

When it comes to cosmetic surgery abroad, the lowest price can come at the highest cost, the campaign warns.

It aims to raise awareness of the risks, protect patients and avoid the NHS paying to fix botched procedures.

Medical influencers like Doc Tally and Midwife Marley - who have 240,000 and 38,000 followers on TikTok respectively - will produce videos offering guidance on how to make trips as safe as possible. They will include a checklist to consider before booking a procedure.

Health minister Karin Smyth warned that "too many people are being left with life-altering injuries after going abroad for medical procedures, without access to proper advice or safeguards."

She said the partnership with TikTok would help people "make safer and more informed choices before they go under the knife – wherever that may be."

Things to check before you book:

When cosmetic procedures go wrong, the consequences can be devastating for patients.

Two years ago, Leah Mattson travelled to İzmir in Turkey to have gastric sleeve surgery.

While the surgery was initially successful and helped her lose weight, last year the 27-year-old returned to the same company to remove excess skin.

This time, the procedure left her with a lopsided belly button, deep scarring on her arms and stomach area that she says left her feeling worse.

After seeing the results of her surgery, Leah said she burst into tears.

"I just wanted to cry and I feel like I actually disliked my body more than when I was overweight."

Leah found the clinic on social media and was encouraged by other people's positive experiences with similar surgeries.

"On apps like Instagram and TikTok, you search for weight-loss surgery and see the majority of people go to Turkey," she explained.

"I was thinking well all these people have had great experiences so I'm going to go.

"I just trusted them because I thought well if they're okay then I'll be okay and I didn't really pay much attention to the horror stories," she added.

"I didn't think it would ever happen to me."

Leah now documents her experience on social media, using her platform to inform others about the risks involved in similar procedures.

The clinic which performed Leah's surgery in Turkey could not be reached for comment, but they previously issued a statement saying "plastic surgery isn't straight-forward and unfortunately some health issues or complications cannot be anticipated".

Experts are urging people to think beyond the slick brochures and marketing, and to consider clinical standards, complication risks, and language barriers.

The Foreign Office will also provide more detailed travel advice for those considering going overseas for such procedures.

Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty said: "If you choose to travel abroad for medical treatment, it is vital you do your research and are fully aware of the risks involved."

"We urge anyone considering a medical procedure abroad to review our travel advice, relevant guidance from the NHS and other professional bodies, and research foreign providers thoroughly to ensure they meet the highest standard of care."

"Informed choices today can help avoid serious complications tomorrow."

Ali Law, TikTok's UK public policy lead, said the platform was "committed" to helping users find "information from trusted sources when searching for topics related to physical and mental health."

Earlier this month, ministers outlined plans to reduce unsafe cosmetic treatments in England.

Under the new rules, only "suitably qualified" and regulated health workers will be allowed to deliver high-risk procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts.

Clinics offering lower-risk procedures such as Botox and fillers will need a licence, and age limits will be introduced to stop children from copying dangerous beauty trends seen on social media.

Why Wolves is a 'dream job' for Rob Edwards

Middlesbrough have granted boss Rob Edwards permission to speak to Premier League club Wolves.

Boro say they are "disappointed" after Edwards, 42, expressed his interest in the Wolves job despite only joining the club in June.

The club added they have agreed a compensation deal with the Black Country club, subject to completion of the relevant paperwork.

Edwards was stood down from Saturday's game against Birmingham City amid Wolves' interest, with first-team coaches Adi Viveash and Harry Watling, and academy manager Craig Liddle in charge.

Wolves had an approach to speak to Edwards rejected by Boro on Thursday and he was locked in talks with members of the Championship club's hierarchy on Friday.

Edwards did not hold his regular pre-game news conference or oversee the team's final training session before the game with Birmingham.

The former defender signed a three-year contract to succeed Michael Carrick as Boro manager less than five months ago.

They were third in the table going into this weekend's games.

Sources close to the situation say Edwards was willing to complete all the duties he has been removed from, with Boro taking the decisions regarding Friday's training session and news conference and Saturday's match.

They are believed to have been angered by Wolves' approach and Edwards' openness to taking the job.

It is understood Edwards views the Wolves job as his dream role, having made more than 100 appearances for the Molineux side between 2004 and 2008.

He grew up in nearby Telford and still has family in the area, though the logistics of any move to Wolves are not said to be a key factor.

Former Coventry and Aston Villa striker Dion Dublin said Middlesbrough fans should not be surprised Edwards has pushed to leave so soon after joining.

"It happens in football all the time. We speak about loyalty - what loyalty? [You will move] if a job comes up that's going to work for you as an individual, financially, for your family," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"He's backing himself as a manager. I know Rob very well. Middlesbrough are in a much better place than Wolves are, that balance is better at the moment, but that pull for Rob is just too much."

Rob Edwards is a former Wolves player, coach and interim manager

Wolves sacked Vitor Pereira on Sunday after a 10-game winless start to the season that leaves them four points adrift at the bottom of the Premier League.

After Pereira was dismissed, BBC Sport reported former Luton manager Edwards was among the leading contenders to replace the 57-year-old Portuguese, alongside former boss Gary O'Neil.

Wolves held talks with O'Neil but the 42-year-old withdrew from the running on Monday, with Edwards emerging as the preferred choice.

After retiring from playing in 2013, Edwards became a coach at the club and briefly interim manager in 2016 following the sacking of Walter Zenga.

Edwards' early coaching career included spells at non-league Telford and England Under-16s.

He became head coach of Forest Green Rovers in 2021 before taking over at Championship side Watford the following year, but was sacked only 11 matches into his tenure.

The former Wales international replaced Nathan Jones as Luton boss in November 2022 and in his first season in charge led the club to the Premier League for the first time, although they had previously enjoyed spells in the English top flight before it was renamed.

Luton were relegated from the Premier League in May 2024 and Edwards left during the 2024-25 season, with the Hatters going on to be relegated to the third tier.

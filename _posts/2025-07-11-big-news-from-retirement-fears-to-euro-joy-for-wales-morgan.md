Experts revealed that Esther Morgan made her Wales debut in 2021

She has started both matches for Wales at Euro 2025, but just months ago defender Esther Morgan thought she was going to have to retire.

The 22-year-old has been beset by injuries for the past three years, initially suffering a serious quad injury while training with Wales in Spain in March 2022, with her torn thigh muscle requiring surgery.

In a case of it does not rain it pours, Morgan's comeback after almost a year on the sidelines was curtailed as she ruptured three ankle ligaments, requiring two different surgeries and another year out recovering.

When Morgan made her Wales return in the Nations League against Sweden she was playing her first international match in 639 days, with the Sheffield United defender admitting she seriously considered the prospect of retirement.

"Six months ago, if you'd asked me if I was going to be here, I'd probably say no," she told BBC Sport Wales.

"I'd probably say at the end of the season, I'm going to just probably give it up."

A popular member of the Wales squad, Morgan has completed her recovery in some style at Wales' first major tournament, Euro 2025, starting both of Wales' group D games against the Netherlands and France.

Morgan says she was always motivated by the prospect of returning in Switzerland during her lengthy rehabilitation, but admits she felt it was more of a pipe dream than an obtainable goal.

"Being here has been amazing, to be fair," she said.

"I think I'm really grateful to have even made it on the plane. There was a long time that it was just something that I was trying to focus on in my rehab. I think it's nice to have that end goal and I'm really grateful for the girls, firstly, for getting here and qualifying, because I wasn't able to be a part of that journey.

"I think I'd be lying if I said that I thought I was going to get back to playing and let alone playing for my country. I think it has put everything into perspective for me."

Morgan says her Wales team-mates have been a big source of inspiration as she has trodden the lonely path of recovering from two serious injuries.

"I think I've had a rough journey through football so far," she said. "I'm grateful it's my journey and it's something that no one can take away from me.

"I think having two major injuries, I'm only 22, I've been out for the best part of two years of my career and it's a hard thing to go through.

"It's hard to watch your teammates and your friends doing so well for club, for country. At times you do think, where am I going with this? 

"But at the same time, it's these people that you look up to and it's people like Sophie Ingle or Jess Fishlock who have come back from serious injuries, you have to rely on their experiences.

"It's just framed the whole thing for me that I'm so lucky to have the job that I do and I'm so grateful to be able to run, kick a ball and be with this amazing group of people, it's really changed me, but I think changed me for the better."

Having made her recovery and returned to playing, Morgan admits she has been surprised and delighted to have started both of Wales' matches in Switzerland.

"I think the injuries have really just made me thankful to be here and just be present and enjoy every moment, because I'm healthy, I'm able to play and just go out and enjoy, really," she said.

"I'm really grateful to (manager) Rhian Wilkinson for putting her trust in me. I think we all want to be playing in these games. I'm grateful to be one of the girls stepping on the pitch and starting these games, but it comes down to a whole squad and how can we work together to bring out the best in each other.

"I didn't even know if I was going to be able to be here. So to hear that I was starting in the first game was just like, wow,  I think it took me a minute to kind of process all the emotions.

"I think it was a mixture of pride, a mixture of pressure, but in the best way possible. And I think for me, it's nice to kind of have a full circle moment with all my family and everyone that supported me."

Morgan says her family have found the emotion of seeing her performing at Euro 2025 too much to take.

"My parents came to the France game and my mum and dad were saying that they were crying the whole time," she added.

"They went out for a meal and they were both just sat there in floods of tears."

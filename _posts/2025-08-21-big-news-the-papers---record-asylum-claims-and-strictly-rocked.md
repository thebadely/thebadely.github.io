Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Guardian says it has seen figures from a classified Israeli military database which suggests that 83% of those killed in Gaza since the war began are civilians. It is a proportion that the paper says is "extremely high" for modern warfare. The Israeli military tells the paper that the figures are "incorrect" and "do not reflect the data available in its systems".

The lead for the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the i Paper is the record number of asylum applications made last year. 111,000 people sought the right to stay in the UK as refugees, a 14% increase on the year before. The Express describes the figure as Labour's "Day of Shame". Writing in the Daily Mirror, the Minister for Border Security and Asylum Dame Angela Eagle said the government had inherited an immigration system "in disarray".

Dozens of asylum hotels across the country will be hit with anti-immigration protests over the weekend, according to the Times. The paper says at least 26 protests have been organised by communities hoping to replicate the results of the court ruling banning migrants from a hotel in Essex. It says anti-racism groups are scrambling to co-ordinate counter protests, amid fears that towns and cities could face the most disruption since last summer's riots.

And the Financial Times reports that Meta has shutdown an Italian Facebook group where men exchanged intimate photos of their wives without their consent. The group, which was called "Mia Moglie" meaning "my wife", had 32,000 members. Meta told the paper that although the group was started in 2019, content was only posted this May. But the FT says the tech company has a ban on sexually exploitative imagery and this has raised questions about how closely it polices content and its ability "to enforce rules".

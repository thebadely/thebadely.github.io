Let's dive into the details: Lucas Paqueta has been capped 55 times by Brazil

West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has suffered mentally and physically from the investigation into a breach of betting rules, says manager Graham Potter.

Paqueta is being investigated by the Football Association for allegedly getting himself booked in four matches.

The 27-year-old Brazil international has been under investigation since August 2023 and was charged by the FA in May last year.

Paqueta, who could be banned from playing for life if found guilty, denies the charges, which relate to Premier League games in 2022 and 2023.

He was in tears after was he booked against Tottenham two weeks ago, after which Potter said he was "frustrated" and had "given everything and in difficult circumstances".

Later that evening Paqueta's wife Maria Fournier said in an Instagram post that they had "been living this nightmare for two years".

Paqueta was left on the bench for last weekend's 2-0 win at Manchester United, which Potter said was because he had a cold.

"It has taken its toll on him. The week he had was a particularly tough week for him personally," Potter said.

"As a result of that he was feeling under the weather on the day before the game and the day of the game, so I didn't want to risk him and make it worse for him.

"Sometimes stress, pressure, can manifest itself in a different way.

"Generally he's come in and conducted himself in a really good way. He's handled it really well."

Potter said he is keen for the case to be resolved before the start of next season.

"It's not my thing to talk about, but the sooner the better for everyone," he said.

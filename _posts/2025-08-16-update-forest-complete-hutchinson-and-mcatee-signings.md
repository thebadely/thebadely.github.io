Experts revealed that Omari Hutchinson (left) and James McAtee won Euro 2025 together with England Under-21s in the summer

Nottingham Forest have completed the signings of Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee on five-year contracts.

England Under-21s winger Hutchinson joins from Ipswich Town for a fee of Â£37.5m, while Forest have paid Manchester City close to Â£30m for midfielder McAtee.

Their arrivals at the City Ground come just a day after manager Nuno Espirito Santo questioned the club's activity in the transfer market. 

"I'm really excited to be here and can't wait to get started. I've played at the City Ground a few times and it's always felt like a hostile atmosphere, so I'm looking forward to playing here with the fans behind us," said 21-year-old Hutchinson.

"I'm going to give it my all and I'm looking forward to the challenge as it's a new chapter for me, but I feel ready."

McAtee, 22, said: "I feel ready for a new challenge and the club had a great season last year so I want to help build on that and show what I can do."

Forest will play in the Europa League this season, and on Friday Portuguese boss Nuno suggested his squad may be ill-equipped to handle the demands that a return to Europe for the first time in 30 years may bring.

The East Midlands club are also in advanced talks for Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo before Sunday's Premier League opener at home to Brentford, with the three deals worth close to Â£90m in total.

They have been looking for reinforcements after selling Anthony Elanga to Newcastle for a club-record deal of an initial Â£55m, and have already signed Dan Ndoye from Bologna.

Hutchinson - who scored in England Under-21s' extra-time final victory against Germany in June at the European Championship after being set up by captain McAtee - joined Town from Chelsea for Â£20m last summer after spending 2023-24 on loan at Portman Road, helping Ipswich into the Premier League.

He scored three goals in 31 league games last season but was unable to stop Kieran McKenna's side dropping back into the Championship.

McAtee has been a long-term target for Forest. He made 27 appearances for City last season but just three Premier League starts.

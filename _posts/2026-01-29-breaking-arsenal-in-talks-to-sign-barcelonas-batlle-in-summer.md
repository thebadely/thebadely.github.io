Let's dive into the details: Ona Batlle won the World Cup with Spain in 2023

Arsenal have held advanced discussions with Barcelona full-back Ona Batlle in the hope of reaching a pre-contract agreement to sign her in the summer.

The 26-year-old is free to hold talks with other clubs with her current contract at Barcelona due to expire at the end of the season.

European champions Arsenal already have plans in place for the summer window and are hopeful of bringing in Batlle on a free transfer.

The Gunners are also close to agreeing terms with England midfielder Georgia Stanway to join when she leaves Bayern Munich at the end of the season.

Should they strike a deal with Spain international Batlle, it would be one of the biggest moves in recent years.

The full-back, who spent three seasons at Manchester United between 2020 and 2023, was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup three years ago.

She also played a key role as Spain reached the Euro 2025 final and Barcelona claimed the Women's Champions League crown in 2024.

Batlle is widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the world but it is understood she is keen for a return to the Women's Super League.

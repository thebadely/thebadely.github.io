Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dimitri Coutya won two golds, a silver and a bronze medal at 2024 Paralypmics

British wheelchair fencer Dimitri Coutya beat China's Yanke Feng to win gold at the Para Fencing World Championships.

Coutya battled back from from 9-4 down to win the men's foil category B 15-11 at the Iksan Stadium in South Korea.

The 27-year-old, a double gold medal winner at the 2024 Paralympics, clinched the title for a second time following his first success at the World Championships in 2017.

"It's my first competition back from Paris so it's mentally tough to be in such an intense environment with incredibly tough athletes," Coutya said.

"So it feels incredible to have come home with the gold today. I've been chasing it for a long time."

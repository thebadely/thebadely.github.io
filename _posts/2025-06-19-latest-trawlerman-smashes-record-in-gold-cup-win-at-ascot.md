Let's dive into the details: William Buick won by seven lengths aboard Trawlerman

Trawlerman went one better than last year to win the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in a track record under a brilliant front-running ride from William Buick.

The 2024 runner-up, trained by John and Thady Gosden, led all the way and left Illinois back in second, with Dubai Future third.

Buick punched the air as he crossed the line on the 85-40 favourite, who was giving the Gosdens a fifth win of the week.

"I was just a passenger. I didn't have to touch the brakes once," said Buick after winning the Gold Cup for the first time.

"It's an extreme distance, two and a half miles, so you need an extraordinary horse with an extraordinary set of skills.

"He's got that lung capacity and stamina. He got in a great rhythm, but he's so genuine."

Trawlerman had finished second 12 months earlier to the now-retired Kyprios, whose trainer Aidan O'Brien and jockey Ryan Moore relied on Illinois this time.

The pair enjoyed a Thursday treble with Charles Darwin, Garden Of Eden and Trinity College, but there was no catching the seven-length winner of the Gold Cup.

John Gosden was winning the race for a fifth time, all in the last eight years, after three triumphs with Stradivarius between 2018-20, and victory with his son Thady thanks to Courage Mon Ami in 2023.

French contender Candelari was among the leading fancies but could only finish sixth, 29 lengths behind the victor.

Temperatures hit 30C at the Berkshire track as the sunny weather continued, and a course spokesperson said one person was taken to hospital while a further 42 received treatment on Wednesday for heat-related conditions.

The good to firm going helped Trawlerman set a new track record of four minutes, 15.02 seconds, beating the time of 4:16.92 set by Rite Of Passage 15 years ago.

It was first top-level Group One winner to be sired by 2015 Derby winner Golden Horn.

Moore's treble puts him on 2,595 British winners as he passed Edward Hide into 10th among the all-time Flat jockeys' list for victories.

The rider first made it three from three in juvenile sprints for O'Brien this week with 8-13 favourite Charles Darwin a clear victor of the Norfolk Stakes.

The winner broke sharply from the stalls and Moore was in control from thereon, sending his mount clear in the final furlong to beat runner-up Wise Approach by two and a quarter lengths.

"He's a big, powerful, strong horse. He really looks like a four-year-old racing against two-year-olds," said O'Brien.

O'Brien and Moore combined again to win the Ribblesdale Stakes with 7-1 chance Garden Of Eden.

Stablemate Island Hopping set a strong gallop and as he faded, Moore was well positioned to take advantage.

He completed a 45-1 treble on Trinity College in the Hampton Court Stakes after taking the initiative against the rail.

The jockey had also looked set to grind out victory on Serious Contender in the King George V Stakes, but 3-1 favourite Merchant swooped late to win.

Tom Marquand came with a driving run on his mount to triumph for trainer William Haggas and owners Highclere Racing.

After Godolphin's first and third in the Gold Cup, Sheikh Mohammed's team had a second victory with Arabian Story, ridden by Oisin Murphy, in the Britannia Stakes to give trainer Saeed bin Suroor his 40th Royal Ascot win.

Murphy sealed a double with the Andrew Balding-trained Never So Brave - a fifth winning favourite on Thursday - in the Buckingham Palace Stakes.

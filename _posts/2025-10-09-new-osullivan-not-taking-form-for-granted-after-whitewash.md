Let's dive into the details: Ronnie O'Sullivan lost against Kyren Wilson in the Xi'an Grand Prix semi-finals in 2024

Ronnie O'Sullivan says he isn't taking his current form "for granted" despite a comprehensive 5-0 win against Scotland's Stephen Maguire at the Xi'an Grand Prix.

The seven-time world champion, who has impressed in his first tournament since August, needed just over an hour to book his spot in the last 16.

O'Sullivan started the match with a break of 134 and compiled runs of 70, 63 and 85 for a resounding success as Maguire managed just 25 points.

The 49-year-old has dropped just one game across his three matches in China and will face Wales' Jak Jones for a place in the quarter-finals.

But the Englishman refused to get carried away by his formidable form as he told the World Snooker Tour: "I feel like I've played great all season.

"But like I always say, this game has a way of humbling you. I'm very, very happy with my game, but talk to me in two, three, four weeks or two months - I'll be 'the game's really hard, really difficult'.

"You can't take this game for granted, you have to enjoy it while it's good and when it's not so good, you have to suck it up and just get through those periods."

Defending champion Kyren Wilson takes on Shaun Murphy in the last 16 after they beat Chinese pair Yuan Sijun and Wu Yize respectively.

Neil Robertson, ranked third in the world, made breaks of 126 and 103, but was edged out in a 5-4 defeat against He Guoqiang, who meets England's Gary Wilson next.

World number 64 Oliver Lines' dream run continues after a narrow 5-4 victory against fellow Englishman Elliot Slessor.

Lines, 30, has only gone beyond the fourth round at a ranking tournament once in his career and goes up against China's Ding Junhui for a place in the last eight.

Teenager Stan Moody suffered a 5-0 defeat by Stuart Bingham, while three-time world champion Mark Williams went through to book a meeting with Barry Hawkins.

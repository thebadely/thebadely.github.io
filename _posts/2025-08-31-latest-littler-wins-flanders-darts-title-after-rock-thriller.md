According to new developments, Luke Littler claimed the Â£30,000 prize

Luke Littler beat Josh Rock 8-7 in a dramatic Flanders Darts Trophy final to claim a fourth PDC European Tour title.

The teenager trailed 5-2 after a bright start from Northern Irishman Rock, but won four legs in a row to take a 6-5 lead in Antwerp, Belgium. 

But, after Rock won two of the next three legs to draw level at 7-7, a last-leg decider was required. 

Littler remained calm to claim the title with an 11-darter, sealing victory with a double 18. 

"I think ever since I've been playing darts, it might sound crazy but I love a last-leg decider," said the 18-year-old.

"I back myself near enough every time, whether it's with or against the darts, but I had to go out in 11 there."

Littler has previously tasted victory in the Austrian Darts Open and two more in the Belgian Darts Open. 

His win in Antwerp means Littler has now won in two of his three European Tour appearances this season following victory in the Belgian Darts Open in March.

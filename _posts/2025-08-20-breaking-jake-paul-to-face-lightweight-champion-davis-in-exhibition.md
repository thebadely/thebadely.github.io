Let's dive into the details: Gervonta Davis has won four of his past five fights inside the distance

Jake Paul will take on WBA lightweight champion Gervonta Davis in an exhibition fight in Atlanta, Georgia on 14 November.

Davis' title will not be on the line because of the huge gulf in weight between the two men.

Paul weighed 200lbs for his last bout with Davis currently campaigning at 135lb.

YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul found fame on the Disney Channel and then as an influencer before stepping into the world of boxing and has a record of 12 wins and one defeat as a professional.

"Yes, he is one of the top pound-for-pound boxers in the world, but my motto is anyone, any time, any place, against all odds," Paul wrote on X, external.

Paul added "first David, then Goliath" in what could be seen as a reference to reports he was in talks over a fight with British heavyweight Anthony Joshua.

Matchroom's Eddie Hearn, who promotes Joshua, recently told BBC Sport that Paul could likely be next for the two-time heavyweight champion when he returns from injury in 2026.

American Davis is undefeated in 31 fights as a professional, winning 30 and drawing one, with 28 of his victories coming by knockout.

Paul beat 39-year-old former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr by unanimous decision in his last fight.

The 28-year-old earned a decision victory against 58-year-old Mike Tyson in November.

Davis retained his WBA lightweight title in his last contest after fighting to a draw against Lamont Roach Jr in March.

In January, Davis was ranked number eight in the pound-for-pound rankings.

Paul has been on a mission to try and convince the boxing fraternity of his ability since making his professional debut in 2020.

After beating a YouTuber, a former NBA player and three former UFC fighters, Paul fell to his first defeat at the hands of Tommy Fury in 2023.

But with a disparity of around 65lbs between Paul and Davis in their last fights this bout will do little for either fighter's reputation.

There is also a significant height difference with Paul standing at 6ft 1in compared to the 5ft 5in 'Tank', while Davis will be giving up nine inches in reach.

The contracted weight, number of rounds and size of gloves for the exhibition are yet to be confirmed.

Paul wore bigger 14oz gloves and contested shorter rounds against Tyson, given the former world champion's age.

There are striking similarities to when Paul's older brother, Logan, fought Floyd Mayweather in 2021.

Mayweather, an undefeated five-weight world champion, was 35lbs lighter and six inches shorter than his opponent during that exhibition.

Let's dive into the details: The mayor of London has said a one-day trial banning traffic from part of Oxford Street marks "the day the fight back began to rescue this street".

Sir Sadiq Khan wants to ban vehicles from a 0.7-mile (about 1.1km) stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, with the potential for further changes towards Tottenham Court Road.

The mayor visited the event, This is Oxford Street, where vehicles were prohibited from accessing a half-mile stretch of the road from Oxford Circus to Orchard Street between noon and 20:00 BST on Sunday.

However concerns have been raised over accessibility for those with mobility issues, traffic causing congestion to smaller side streets and its effect on residents.

Detailed proposals for traffic under the pedestrianisation plan will be consulted on later this year.

Conservative councillor for Westminster, Tim Barnes said: "It's going to be damaging to local businesses and local residents. 

"We're going to see traffic that normally goes down Oxford Street.

"Not private cars they've already been banned - but emergency vehicles, buses, delivery vehicles, pushed onto the tiny side streets that really can't take it."

The Soho Society has also previously raised concerns about access for those with  mobility issues or who are carrying heavy shopping.

Pedestrians, Grace and Tom Brown are among those who think the traffic should be gone for good. 

"I would have it like this all the time," Grace said.

Tom added: "I think it would really encourage all the businesses. I think people are put off by how busy it is.

"I think if people if cold come and chat and stroll about, and you feel safe, that would be great."

Another passer-by said it was a great idea.

Kish Sha said: "Yeah it's really made my day having this space to walk through. There's so much razzmatazz.

"It makes sense to keep it permanently for the sheer number of people that come through here.

"I'm sure bus services and emergency vehicles have other routes they can come through quickly in the area."

Sir Sadiq added: "Today is a glimpse to what the future could be like, where this is a place where people can walk. It increases footfall. 

"It increases spend, (it will be a) great place to shop, to do leisure, but also have outdoor events.

"(Today) will go down in history, in my view, as the day the fight back began to rescue this street."

The mayor said he "fully understands" the "minority of residents" who raised concerns over congestion and accessibility, and said the authority had consulted residents.

"We're going to carry on not just working with residents and the council, but working with retailers, landowners and others to make sure we can return this street to its previous glory," Sir Sadiq said.

Asked if he had plans to pedestrianise more thoroughfares in the capital, he said: "We've already worked with councils to pedestrianise parts of London, outside Somerset House. We've, this summer, invested in al fresco dining during the summer months.

"So we are working with the government so we can have more powers over licensing and so forth.

"I think hospitality, retail are really important sectors of our economy, but also, (they are) one of the reasons people love to come to London."

Oxford Street is one of the world's busiest shopping areas, with around half a million visitors each day.

A previous attempt by Sir Sadiq to pedestrianise part of Oxford Street was blocked by the then-Conservative-run Westminster City Council in 2018.

His latest proposals depend on obtaining permission from the government to establish a new Mayoral Development Corporation, which would provide planning powers.

The aim is for this to be created by the start of next year.

According to new developments, Feyi-Waboso's autumn international campaign was cut short by a concussion, before he dislocated his shoulder on Exeter duty

Exeter and England wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso's prospects of playing Test rugby this summer increased after the 22-year-old was selected for a two-day England training camp this week.

Feyi-Waboso has not played since dislocating his shoulder in December, with his comeback delayed by a setback suffered at an England camp in February.

Gloucester centre Seb Atkinson, Leicester back row Emeke Ilione and Sale midfielder Rekeiti Ma'asi-White are also included in a 33-strong group that does not include either British and Irish Lions, or players from Northampton and Bath, who are preparing for European finals this weekend.

Gloucester's 20-year-old prop Afolabi Fasogbon, who was ruled out of Six Nations contention with an ankle injury, is named, along with the likes of Jamie George, George Ford and Ben Curry, who missed out on Lions selection earlier this month.

In 2017, England toured Argentina in the same summer that the Lions were taking on New Zealand. 

A teenage Tom Curry and Sam Underhill made their Test debuts against the Pumas and a little more than two years later were key parts of a Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand.

Head coach Steve Borthwick expects similar to happen again this year with 13 of his players selected for the Lions tour of Australia.

"There is no doubt players will emerge this summer and will be part of the Rugby World Cup 2027 squad that wouldn't have been if we had to pick it today," he told 5 Live Sport.

"I have no doubt. It is the same thing that happened in 2017 - players grab the opportunity. 

"I told them today that opportunity rises and change happens â the players that get the chance have to grab hold of it with both hands."

Feyi-Waboso had a breakout campaign last season, scoring his first international try off the bench in Six Nations defeat by Scotland, before crossing in all three matches on England's summer tour of Japan and New Zealand. 

His top-end pace brings an extra dimension to England's attack and was sorely missed despite the team finishing second in this year's Six Nations.

Exeter and England publicly disagreed over how his injury treated, with the recently-signed Professional Game Partnership giving England a greater say in the conditioning and rehabilitation of their centrally contracted players.

Exeter head coach Rob Baxter indicated earlier this month that Feyi-Waboso could get a run-out in the Chiefs' final game of the season against Sale on 31 May.

Intriguingly, British and Irish Lions head coach Andy Farrell suggested that he would supplement his initial 38-man selection for the tour of Australia with later call-ups for those who need a chance to prove their fitness.

England will play Argentina in Buenos Aires and San Juan on 5 July and 12 July respectively before a one-off Test against the United States on 19 July in Washington.

They will play an uncapped warm-up match against a France XV on 21 June at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham.

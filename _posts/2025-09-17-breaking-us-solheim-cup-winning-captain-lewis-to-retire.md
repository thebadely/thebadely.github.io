It has been recently reported that Stacy Lewis led the United States to their first Solheim Cup victory in seven years in 2024

Stacy Lewis, the captain of the United States' 2024 Solheim Cup-winning team, says she will retire from golf at the end of the LPGA season.

The 40-year-old won 13 LPGA titles, including two majors, and led the United States to victory over Europe in last year's Solheim Cup.

She also spent 25 weeks as world number one and was named LPGA Player of the Year in 2012 and 2014.

Lewis' achievements came despite being diagnosed with curvature of the spine at the age of 11 and spending the next seven years wearing a back brace for 18 hours a day. 

"Never in a million years would I have thought this journey playing golf would still be going in 2025, but the time has come to put the clubs away," Lewis wrote on social media. 

"I am going to miss the LPGA Tour family and this part of my life, but my body has told me it's time."

Lewis' two major victories were at the 2011 Chevron Championship and the 2013 women's British Open.

She represented the United States four times at the Solheim Cup as a player and twice as captain - including last year's dramatic 15Â½-12Â½ victory in Virginia - as well as finishing in a share of fourth place at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Here’s what you need to know: Manchester City head into the winter break top of the Women's Super League

As the Women's Super League and European football pause for the winter break, there is an opportunity for fans and players to take stock and reflect on the season so far.

In the absence of action on the pitch, we asked supporters on Reddit for their questions on all things women's football related for BBC Sport women's football news reporter Emma Sanders.

Here are some the best questions, and Emma's answers:

How does the WSL stand at the winter break?

'Nightmare' Shaw's remarkable 100 goals for Man City

Bonmati named Fifa Best women's player of the year

What are your thoughts on only teams not playing in Europe taking part in the League Cup from next season? Reddit user Awkward_Client_1908

I think it's a great idea and long overdue. It will give other teams more chance to be competitive and to play more games, which players need to prevent under-loading. 

There have been times in the past where teams knocked out in the cup early only have two or three games in a month. On the flip side, those clubs playing in the Champions League often have three games a week so it reduces the schedule on players who are already playing too much. 

I always felt it wasn't a great look that a team could play three games and win the League Cup. This feels like a more-rounded competition.

Why do journalists routinely ask questions with very obvious answers to them? For example, asking "how important is this win?" all the time. Reddit user SnooDoughnuts2297

Hello! It's an obvious question to ask but we still need the managers to say something about it so we can write follow-up pieces. 

If Arsenal beat Barcelona in the Champions League and we didn't ask Renee Slegers how significant that was, we'd really struggle to write a piece on it. Her saying "this was the greatest night of my life", for example, helps a wider BBC audience appreciate how big the game was, why Arsenal beating Barcelona wasn't something that happens every day and the impact that win has on the club. 

Even though we know the answer we're going to get, we still need them to say it. 

Readers don't care about what I think, they care about what Slegers thinks. These answers are also perfect for TV or radio news bulletins as they are short and give a good summary of why it's a big news story.

With Man City currently sitting at the top of the WSL, can you see them remaining there and winning the league? Also, who do you think is the best player in the WSL at the moment and why? Reddit user loverofthebeautyful 

Yes, I do. They have been brilliant so far this season and look like they are really enjoying their football. They have arguably had the best squad for a few seasons and not won the title when they should have. 

Andree Jeglertz seems to have instilled some more confidence and creativity in their game. 

It's always tough to choose the best player but I think Kerstin Casparij has been the standout for City and in the WSL.

Which team has been the biggest positive surprise in your eyes? What do you think lead to their improved performance? Reddit user Gvndam11

There are probably two teams. Manchester City have hit the heights much quicker than I thought they would under Andree Jeglertz. He's done a fantastic job since taking over in the summer and they have been the best team in the league by quite some distance in my opinion. 

But Tottenham have been the real surprise. Martin Ho is a good coach and we knew that but the squad isn't that deep and he's done really well to get the best out of a small core of players and improve their style.

I always listen to pressers and wonder about how journalists feel about asking questions that managers may find challenging. Do you feel free to push (politely) for answers on something if you feel a follow-up is needed? Do the press officers restrict you in any way? Thanks for the Ask Me Anything and all you do! Reddit user Cococamcam

Hello, thanks for the question. It's the number one priority of a journalist, to find out information and/or hold clubs and their representatives to account. I always try to remember there is a human being behind the table and approach them with empathy. It's easier when you have shown respect to them and you get that in return. 

That is why we try to build relationships with players, staff and clubs to make these situations easier. It's about giving them a right to reply or to voice their reasonings so fans can understand decisions better â not about trying to catch them out. 

Press officers will always try to minimise it but they can't stop us from doing our jobs, though some have tried in the past! 

It's definitely not easy and there is an art to it. But experience, respect and empathy help.

Is anyone else on Bunny Shaw's level? Reddit user ButWhichPandaAreYou

She's world-class! I'd love to see her get more global recognition.

Do you think the lack of Champions League football has helped Man City in the league so far this season and, if so, do you think this might become a pattern going forward for the fourth-placed team? Reddit user shelbyj 

Hmm, it's interesting isn't it. 

I do think City have taken advantage of it and have gained more training time with a new coach due to a quieter schedule. But I think London City Lionesses could disrupt that pattern in the very near future...

It seems like this year's FAWSL is even more unpredictable than previous years. Everton beating Chelsea last week. The comeback from Utd. Do you think the league is getting more competitive? Reddit user Crazy-Tomatillo-1876

Hey. Thanks for the question. It always seems to get more competitive each season but I do think there's still a clear divide between the top four and the rest on a consistent basis. 

Hopefully clubs keep investing and bringing in/developing more talent that can challenge them.

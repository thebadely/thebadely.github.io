It has been recently reported that Luke Littler, 18, has already won six major titles

Luke Littler fired a 170 checkout to clinch victory over defending champion Mike de Decker and reach the quarter-finals of the "brutal" World Grand Prix. 

Littler, 18, averaged 98.95 to win the opening set before capitalising on the Belgian's double-start struggles to take a 2-0 lead. 

And world champion Littler cruised through the third set without dropping a leg - finishing with a flourish by taking out 170 - to wrap up a comfortable win.

The Englishman will now face Wales' Gerwyn Price for a place in the semi-finals at the Mattioli Arena.

"I said to myself 'let's leave with a big one'," Littler told Sky Sports.

"Mike definitely didn't play his best, so I had to jump on it and lead early. 

"I am hitting the double 20 and as a player you can feel that nine-darter coming. Hopefully, we can have a go next round.

"This tournament is brutal. We have seen some shocks this year but I had to do my job."

Price, the 2020 winner and seventh seed, got the better of Josh Rock 3-0 while averaging 92.46 and hitting four 180s. 

Jonny Clayton, the winner in 2021, overcame Luke Woodhouse 3-1 and will face Dirk van Duijvenbode in the last eight after the Dutchman posted a 3-0 win against Daryl Gurney.

'Phenomenal' Fery as GB wildcard knocks out 20th seed Popyrin

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

British wildcard and world number 461 Arthur Fery described his huge upset of 20th seed Alexei Popyrin on the opening day of Wimbledon as "the most proud day" of his tennis career.

The 22-year-old, who attended school a short distance from the historic venue, stunned Masters 1000 champion Popyrin 6-4 6-1 4-6 6-4 to secure his place in the second round.

Fery had not been past the first round in his only two previous attempts, while injury had seen him drop out of the top 400 in the world.

He will next face Italian Luciano Darderi, who is ranked 59th.

"It's probably the most proud day in terms of my tennis career," Fery said. 

"It's great, and hopefully I can keep going and stay healthy for the rest of the year."

Fery's victory followed another impressive win for a Briton in the men's draw, after qualifier Oliver Tarvet beat Leandro Riedi on his Wimbledon debut.

Frey and Tarvet are among 23 British players who featured in the first round of the men's and women's main draw at Wimbledon - the most in 41 years.

Former British number one Cameron Norrie and world number 151 Billy Harris also progressed, with the latter securing his first win at Wimbledon.

However, British number two Jacob Fearnley and wildcards Oliver Crawford and Henry Searle were knocked out.

Thirty-year-old Harris, who qualified for the main draw on ranking for the first time after being a wildcard last year, beat Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 6-3 6-2 6-4. 

He next faces Nuno Borges of Portugal.

Crawford was beaten by Italian world number 73 Mattia Bellucci  6-7 (7-2) 6-3 6-4 6-4, while 19-year-old Searle - who won the boys' Wimbledon title two years ago - was beaten 4-6 6-2 7-6 (13-11) 6-2 by American Ethan Quinn.

Fearnley saw his Wimbledon tournament ended in the first round as he was beaten by Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca.

Fearnley, 23, had never lost an opening-round match at a Grand Slam before but was outclassed by his 18-year-old opponent 6-4 6-1 7-6 (7-5)

This was only Fonseca's second victory on grass but he has caught the eye this year with a number of impressive performances, beating Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open in January and then winning his first ATP Tour title in February with the Argentina Open.

Fearnley has enjoyed his own meteoric rise in recent times, climbing from outside the top 500 just over a year ago to arriving at this tournament 51st in the world.

He had looked set to grab the first-set advantage, hitting a fine overhead volley on his way to securing three break points. 

But Fonseca took the next eight points in a row to turn the match on its head, claiming the break himself and then serving out for the first set.

Fearnley had no answer for Fonseca in a damaging second set that lasted just 23 minutes and although he put up more of a fight in the third, the teenager edged the tie-break to progress.

Thousands queue for Wimbledon opening day

It was a gruelling start in the heat at Wimbledon, which recorded its hottest-ever opening day as temperatures surpassed 32C.

Norrie was in action at its peak in the middle of the afternoon but he came through the tough conditions to beat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut 6-3 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7-3).

The 29-year-old beat the current British number one Jack Draper at Wimbledon last year and previously reached the semi-finals, but his form dipped after that and he almost dropped out of the top 100.

But he has been revitalised on grass and continued that momentum with his first win on the grass this year.

"I wanted to enjoy like a kid playing Wimbledon again," said Norrie, who next faces 12th seed Frances Tiafoe.

"I was not thinking I was British number one or British number two.  I was there to play and enjoy the match."

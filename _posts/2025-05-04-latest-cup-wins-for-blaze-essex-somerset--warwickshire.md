Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Tammy Beaumont's first century of the season helped propel The Blaze to a third successive win

Tammy Beaumont hit an unbeaten century as The Blaze beat Hampshire to go top of the women's One-Day Cup table.

The England opener made 112 off 113 balls to chase down a modest target of 190 with seven wickets in hand at Trent Bridge.

Their third successive win leapfrogged them above previous leaders Hampshire and Lancashire - who lost by five wickets to Essex, who picked up their first win.

Elsewhere, Warwickshire edged past Surrey, despite Sophia Dunkley's ton, and Somerset beat Durham in a rain-affected game to move up to second.

Hampshire arrived at Trent Bridge unbeaten, but slipped from 62-1 to 101-5 after three wickets from England leg-spinner Sarah Glenn (3-36).

Opener Ella McCaughan hit 57, but a miserly Blaze attack restricted the visitors to 189-7 from their 50 overs, with Kathryn Bryce's 10 overs costing just 22 runs.

Lauren Bell removed both Kathryn and Sarah Bryce cheaply to put the chase in early jeopardy at 33-3.

However, Beaumont hit two sixes and 11 fours, while Georgia Elwiss made a 75-ball 58 in an unbroken 159-run stand as the Blaze made it home with more than 13 overs to spare.

Durham were bowled out for 216 after morning rain at Chester-le-Street had reduced their match with Somerset to 39 overs per side.

Ellie Anderson (3-49) had the hosts wobbling on 49-4 before 89 off 94 balls from captain Hollie Armitage gave the Durham bowlers something to work with, despite Chloe Skelton's 3-16.

Somerset opener Rebecca Odgers knocked 60 runs off the target before Fran Wilson added a run-a-ball 68 before falling to Katie Levick (2-33).

But Amanda Jade-Wellington hit an unbeaten 31 from 27 balls to secure a four-wicket win on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method with nine balls to spare.

Emma Lamb continued her good early-season form for Lancashire with 43 off 53 balls at Chelmsford, sharing a 106-run opening stand with Eve Jones (57).

But from 133-1, Essex's Kate Coppack (2-39) and Abtaha Maqsood (3-42) restricted the visitors to 230-8.

In the reply, Hannah Jones took 3-39 and Lamb chipped in with 2-39, but Jodi Grewcock's well-paced undefeated 73, following Alice Macleod's 45 from 47 balls, saw the hosts to a maiden win with 16 balls to spare.

Skipper Bryony Smith stroked 14 fours in a 72-ball 78 before England batter Dunkley - who made 92 against Durham on Wednesday - added a six and seven fours in an unbeaten 102 as Surrey piled up 313-7 at Beckenham.

Davina Perrin set the pace for the Warwickshire reply with 69 at quicker than a run-a-ball, and Natasha Wraith maintained the momentum with 54 from 45 deliveries.

Bethan Ellis then completed a superb chase with an unbeaten 63, as Warwickshire got home with three wickets and 3.3 overs in hand.

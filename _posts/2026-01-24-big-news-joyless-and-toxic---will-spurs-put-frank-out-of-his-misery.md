It's like Comedy Central at the back for Spurs - Williams

Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank left Turf Moor to the sounds that are now becoming a familiar backing track to what looks an increasingly unsustainable tenure.

Cristian Romero's last-minute header rescued a 2-2 draw just as Burnley looked on the brink of piling more embarrassment on the embattled Dane by securing their first win in 14 Premier League games.

'Dr Tottenham' â the jibe that suggests they can prescribe a cure for even the most serious ills of their opponents â looked to be on the brink of the most dramatic cure yet until Romero struck.

But if Frank thought this would ease the growing anger of travelling fans he would have been sorely mistaken as he once more felt the full force of their fury after the final whistle.

Indeed, the discontent surfaced even in the first half as Spurs fans chanted "sideways and backwards everywhere we go" as the ball was passed around aimlessly.

Micky van de Ven's opening goal was greeted with ironic chants of "we're staying up" from the visitors' section.

And, once the final whistle sounded, Frank walked off to deafening chants of "sacked in the morning" from his own fans and other more colourful phrases of the uncomplimentary variety.

Frank's position came under internal scrutiny after the home loss to another struggling side, West Ham United, with BBC Sport reporting that at least one member of the club's executive team has actively raised the option of ending his reign in recent weeks.

The question for the club's hierarchy now is whether they should move quickly to put him out of his misery or give Frank the opportunity to turn Spurs' fortunes around.

Late Romero header rescues draw for Tottenham at Burnley

Frank got some relief with the Champions League win against Borussia Dortmund, which illustrated the sharp contrast between Spurs in the Premier League and in Europe.

Spurs have won only two of their past 14 Premier League games - but there is the good news that a win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday puts them straight through to the last 16 of the Champions League.

For all that, the ill-feeling continually aimed towards Frank, as was in evidence here, is not going away and it must be a question of when rather than if Spurs make a change.

It was impossible to disagree with Frank's assertion that Spurs should have won this game measured on chances and the series of outstanding saves made by Burnley keeper Martin Dubravka. The rub is they ended up grasping desperately for the point Romero's thumping header gave them.

Van de Ven's goal gave them a deserved lead, but Spurs then switched off to allow Axel Tuanzebe to sweep in Burnley's equaliser in first-half stoppage time.

Spurs had more opportunities after the break, but such is the frailty of Frank's team that once Burnley, lying in 19th place in the table, actually showed the courage of their convictions, they lost control, leading to Lyle Foster's second for the Clarets.

If Burnley had won, surely a decision on Frank's fate could not have been delayed any longer.

'We did not defend well enough' - Frank

Frank was doing his best to keep the lid on his emotions and accentuate the positives after the game, but he revealed his frustration as he thumped the table in front of him three times in time with his words when he insisted Spurs should "never, ever, ever" concede a goal like Tuanzebe's, repeating the message and actions when discussing Foster's goal.

"You can't say we didn't do everything to win," he told Match of the Day. "We just need to keep improving. The only way it can be is calm heads, carry on and keep doing what we think is the right thing.

"You see the game. We do more than enough to win the game. We just need to defend better in two situations. And, of course, score another goal that could make the difference at 1-0."

And yet again Frank had to rely on defenders for goals, showing once more the lack of potency â and resources â he has in attack.

Only Richarlison, with eight, has scored more than Van de Ven, who has netted seven this season. The Dutchman's tally is also the most of any Premier League defender across all competitions.

Romero has scored four Premier League goals this season, but his latest was not enough to dilute what is becoming the familiar toxicity aimed in Frank's direction.

"Van de Ven and Romero got the goals but there were more problems at the back against a Burnley side who've now gone 14 games without a win," said ex-Wales defender Ashley Williams, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.

"I just think in the second half it was so easy for Burnley. They had four big chances in the game and I'm sure Thomas Frank will be unhappy with how his team defended. There's a lack of discipline and focus when Spurs need calmness from their big players and leaders."

This explains, to a large degree, the pursuit of Liverpool's Scotland left-back Andy Robertson, with talks ongoing.

If Spurs can get the result they need in Frankfurt, Frank may find some solace, but this carries all the hallmarks of a situation coming to a head with a fierce upcoming fixture list.

After Frankfurt, Spurs are at home to Manchester City before a visit to Manchester United. They then host Newcastle before a north London derby at home to Arsenal.

Life is anything but easy for Thomas Frank. And it is not going to get any easier in his joyless, toxic reign at Tottenham.

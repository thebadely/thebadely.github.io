Experts revealed that Darcy Graham (left) scored a superb hat-trick for Edinburgh

United Rugby Championship: Edinburgh v Ulster

Edinburgh (19) 47

Tries: Graham 3, Bradbury 2, Ashman, Shoeman Cons: Thompson 4, Healy 2 

Ulster (12) 17

Tries: Kok, Penalty, Postlethwaite

Darcy Graham's hat-trick and Magnus Bradbury's double helped Edinburgh secure a place in the last eight of the United Rugby Championship as they swept to a bonus-point win over Ulster in the Scottish capital.

Cardiff's loss to the Stormers earlier in the evening meant that a four-try victory was the target for the hosts. They scored seven.

Edinburgh ran in three of the four they needed in the first half. Graham, Bradbury and Ewan Ashman scored for the home side but a penalty try and a gift to Werner Kok made it a seven-point game at the break.

The outstanding Bradbury got his second after the interval and with it came that critical bonus-point score early in the second half.

Pierre Schoeman went over for a fifth in what was a terrific performance on a high-pressure night. Even when Jude Postlethwaite ran in a spectacular score from his own 22, Graham responded quickly.

And then the little genius struck again at the end. If the Lions happen to be looking for another wing any time soon, they need look no further.

The victory means that Jamie Ritchie, a lifelong Edinburgh player exiting for France, hasn't yet played his last game for his club. His last home game, for sure, but there's still life left in this season for his team.

A frenetic opening saw Edinburgh blow two big chances from close-range line-outs only to recover and cut Ulster open soon after, Graham being the man doing the cutting.

Wes Goosen put the wing through a gap and ran all the way to the posts at a packed Hive Stadium. Nice start for the home team needing a bonus-point win to make the knockouts. Not so nice for Ulster, who were only playing for pride.

And it got better soon after as they turned the screw. Another close-range line-out but this time they executed, Bradbury blasting his way through what was left of the Ulster defence.

With a lead of 12-0 and all the momentum, Edinburgh then got hit between the eyes by Ulster's response. The visitors got a penalty try when Graham, in an attempt at cutting out what would have been a try-scoring pass to Zac Ward, deliberately knocked-on.

Graham was sent to the bin for his troubles. He was only in there a few minutes when Ulster levelled through Kok, who picked up and crashed over after Wes Goosen failed to deal with a routine chip through.

The home team regained the initiative in quick order. From another line-out inside the Ulster 22, Ashman went like the clappers and thundered over. Ross Thompson converted and the gap was seven.

The Graham yellow-card spell finished 7-5 to Edinburgh and Sean Everitt's team were a step closer to the last eight. As long as they won, which is rarely easy for Edinburgh with their propensity for drama.

There was no such vulnerability this time. Edinburgh began the new half powerfully. When Hamish Watson, playing wonderfully, whipped Nathan Doak into touch near his own line, Edinburgh had the attacking platform they needed.

It took a few attempts but Bradbury eventually put them into bonus-point land after a tap and drive near the posts. Thompson's conversion stretched the lead out to 14.

Schoeman added a fifth just before the hour, the Lion barrelling over from a few metres. Thompson converted. Postlethwaite struck and Graham turned one try into three in quick order. Relief and delight at the Hive.

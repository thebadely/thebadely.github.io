"What a goal. What a finish. What a player!" - Watch Bowie's wonder goal

"Superlatives wouldn't do Kieron Bowie justice," Hibernian legend Lewis Stevenson raved. "He's going to have an amazing career."

Superlatives are what will come Bowie's way though, and in spades, after the Scotland striker helped Hibs into a Conference League qualifying play-off with a breathtaking goal.

On 59 minutes at Easter Road on Thursday, with Hibs 2-0 down to Partizan Belgrade on the night and level on aggregate, Bowie arrested Partizan's momentum with a first-time shot from at least 35 yards out that flew into the back of the net off the post.

"I thought I'd seen a few good goals already this season," head coach David Gray said. "The one against Kilmarnock at the weekend was incredible - I think Kieron's is better.

"Add to that the emotion, the environment, where he's done it. It was a special goal at a special time."

Bowie suffered an injury-hit first season at Easter Road, scoring six goals in 22 appearances, but has started this season superbly, finding the back of the net three times in six starts.

The man himself was poetic in his description of his third - and undoubtedly best so far this term. 

"I just hit it and thankfully it took the spiderwebs off the back of the net," Bowie said. "Moments like this, that's why I've come here."

"It's the best goal I've seen," team-mate Chris Cadden said. "Ridiculous. What a finish."

Jordan Smith bounced back from two first-half errors to make several important saves

Hibs went into Thursday's second leg as strong favourites given their excellent showing in Belgrade, but their two-goal lead slipped away in alarming fashion as goalkeeper Jordan Smith pushed Milan Vukotic's long-range effort into the top corner before allowing Jovan Milosevic's tame effort to squirm under him.

He trudged off at half-time to howls of dismay from the home supporters, but Gray believes the break came at a good time for his side.

"For large spells of the first half the shape was really good, we had the better chances and then there's obviously a couple of mistakes," Gray said.

"The character was certainly tested. Half-time came at a good time - I was able to calm them down and then it's all about character."

And they showed their character through Bowie's inspired strike and through a string of Smith saves, who put his first-half horror show behind him admirably.

"I'm delighted for Jordan for his second-half performance," Gray said. "He made big saves at big times."

Gray was keen to point out that his team's character was then tested again.

The tie looked done. Hibs were through, 3-2 up on aggregate with 30 seconds left of time added on.

That was before Partizan's Andrej Kostic swept home in the 96th minute to force extra time.

However, unlike in Europa League qualifying against Midtjylland, there would be no heartache this time.

"The game became stretched, we lost control at times," Gray said. "You think you're over the line and then you have to go again for another 30 minutes.

"Now it's all done and dusted there will be improvements to come from it, but that's for another night."

Here’s what you need to know: Chris Eubank Jr won the first fight against Conor Benn in April on all three scorecards

Conor Benn and Chris Eubank Jr step in the ring together again on Saturday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, almost seven months after their first encounter.

Eubank beat his bitter rival in a 12-round battle and is aiming to continue the current clean sweep his family has over the Benn clan.

Their fathers - Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank - fought each other in two world title contests in the 1990s.

Will Benn claim revenge in the rematch or will Eubank just be too much for the smaller man?

Benn landed 215 punches to Eubank's 367 punches

The first fight was a lot of fun, but a clear win for Eubank over 12 rounds.

Eubank appeared weight drained, operating at a lower level than usual but Benn was unable to make that count in his favour.

Benn failed to use his speed and cardio to overwhelm Eubank and will be eager to rectify that. He has suggested he will use a more conservative approach in the rematch, saying he was too obsessed with claiming a knockout in the first few rounds.

The punch statistics also pointed to a Eubank win. Eubank landed 367 punches, Benn landed 215 punches.

Benn landed 180 power punches compared to Eubank's 227.

Eubank also had a better landing percentage, with 40% to Benn's 36%.

All three judges scored the contest 116-112 for Eubank.

What were the scorecards for Eubank v Benn 1?

After the fight, the scorecards revealed judges were split on five occasions - the second, seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th round.

All the judges gave Eubank the opening round, fourth, fifth, sixth, 11th and 12th, while they were unanimous on Benn taking the third. 

Eubank is by far the more experienced fighter. The 36-year-old has 38 bouts on his record and has been in the ring against world champions George Groves, Billy Joe Saunders, James DeGale and Liam Smith.

Eubank's three defeats have come against Smith, Groves and Saunders. He avenged his loss to Smith, was narrowly beaten by Saunders early in his career and was outclassed by Groves in his singular world title fight.

As the bigger man, Eubank will have a size advantage and once said he only needed 60% of his best to beat Benn.

Benn is the younger man at 29, and was undefeaed in 23 fights before being beaten by Eubank. Benn's lack of pedigree at world title level may well have been what was missing for him in the first fight.

Benn has a slight reach and height disadvantage. 

Benn and Eubank were scheduled to fight on 8 October 2022 at the O2 Arena in London. Benn failed two voluntary drug tests in the build-up, and the British Boxing Board of Control "prohibited" the fight as a result, refusing to sanction it.

The fight was cancelled 48 hours beforehand and Benn began a two-year battle against a lengthy doping ban.

Benn was cleared to return in November 2024 after the Board and UK Anti-Doping failed in their appeal against the National Anti-Doping Panel's decision to lift his suspension.

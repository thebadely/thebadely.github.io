Here’s what you need to know: Nathan Lyon had played 71 consecutive home Tests for Australia before being left out at the Gabba

Nathan Lyon was left out of an Australia side for the first time in a home Test since 2012, while the hosts were also still without captain Pat Cummins for the second Ashes Test in Brisbane.

Amid speculation Cummins could make a surprise return despite not being named in the squad, the pace bowler remains on the sidelines as he continues to recover from a back problem.

But the shock came through the omission of Lyon â Australia's third-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket - with the hosts opting for an all-seam attack for the day-night Test at the Gabba.

Cricket Australia's own website called the decision a "bombshell".

It meant a third cap for seamer Michael Neser. Neser's two previous Test appearances came in pink-ball Tests.

After England won the toss and chose to bat, stand-in Australia captain Steve Smith said: "Pat was close. He's done everything right. We thought it might have been a little bit risky for this game but he's tracking well for the next one.

"With the pink ball, we think it's going to offer quite a bit, particularly later on under lights. We play in the night a lot and thought that was going to be the best attack to take 20 wickets in this fixture."

Only the great Shane Warne and legendary seamer Glenn McGrath have taken more Test wickets for Australia than Lyon. The 38-year-old needs two more to go past McGrath's 562 and into second place on the list.

The last time Lyon was left out of a home Test was against India at the Waca in January 2012. He had played 71 consecutive home Tests.

"I'm really surprised Australia left Lyon out given his record at the Gabba and also how this ball gets soft quickly," said former England spinner Alex Hartley on Test Match Special.

"You might need someone to hold up an end but maybe they're thinking they've got enough part-time spinners to do that - Labuschagne can bowl a bit."

Lyon has now been left out of the Australia XI twice in three Tests â he was also omitted from the day-nighter against West Indies in Jamaica in July, which Australia won by 176 runs.

On that decision, Lyon said: "Disappointed on a number of levels. I believe I can play a role in any conditions, and I still honestly believe that.

"I want to play every game for Australia, and I've just got that belief that I can play a role in any conditions, as every cricketer should have that belief."

Neser lengthens Australia's batting at number eight and has the experience of the Gabba being his home ground, but only Warne and McGrath have more wickets than Lyon in Brisbane.

As expected, Leeds-born Josh Inglis came into the Australia side for the injured Usman Khawaja. Travis Head continues as opener, with Inglis listed to bat at number seven.

England had already confirmed their XI, with spin-bowling all-rounder Will Jacks taking the place of injured fast bowler Mark Wood.

England have not won at the Gabba since 1986 or in any of their previous three pink-ball matches in Australia.

This is the first day-nighter in Australia in which England have batted first, as captain Ben Stokes extended his team's run of winning the toss to seven consecutive Tests.

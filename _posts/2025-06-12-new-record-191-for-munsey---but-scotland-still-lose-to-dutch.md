Scorecard

George Munsey's mammoth innings of 191 for Scotland - a record by a player from an associate nation - proved to be not enough as the Netherlands pulled off the highest chase in Cricket World Cup League 2 history.

Max O'Dowd struck 158 of his own in Dundee, including a six down the ground to clinch victory, as the visitors went past Scotland's 369-6 with four wickets to spare in a dramatic final over.

The tally of 374-6 equalled the Dutch record score for a one-day international and was the highest chase ever by an associate nation.

Safyaan Sharif became Scotland's all-time leading wicket-taker in ODIs as he took 3-62, but it was to be to no avail as the Dutch, sitting second in the table behind the United States, stretched their lead over their third-top hosts to four points.

In setting a new ODI batting record for Scotland, Munsey put on 58 for the first wicket with fellow opener Charlie Tear before blasting his way to an extraordinary innings, which included 14 fours and 11 sixes.

He surpassed the previous best of 175 scored by Calum MacLeod in 2014 and now has more than 5,000 runs for Scotland in all formats.

The 32-year-old left-hander looked all set to carry his bat for a double century but was bowled by Vivian Kingma in the 49th over from the 150th ball he faced.

Matthew Cross, filling in for the ill Richie Berrington as captain, pitched in with 59 runs.

There was also a late cameo from Michael Leask, who hit three sixes on his way to an unbeaten 28 from 14 deliveries as Scotland finished on 369-6, their third highest ODI total.

Sharif took his 259th international wicket in all capped matches when he removed Dutch opener Michael Levitt for 44.

The 34-year-old, who made his ODI debut in 2011, then combined with Munsey to reduce the visitors to 75-2.

However, Teja Nidamanuru, with 51, and Noah Croes, with his own half-century, kept the scoreboard ticking until O'Dowd ensured victory with a thumping six with four balls to spare.

It meant the Dutch matched their highest score in an ODI - the 374-9 they achieved in a dramatic World Cup qualifying win against West Indies two years ago.

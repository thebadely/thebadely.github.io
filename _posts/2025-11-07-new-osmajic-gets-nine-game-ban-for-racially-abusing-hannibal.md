According to new developments, Milutin Osmajic signed for Preston North End in 2023 from Spanish side Cadiz

Preston North End forward Milutin Osmajic has been given a nine-game ban after he was charged with racially abusing Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri.

The incident happened during Preston's goalless draw with Burnley in February and the 26-year-old will now miss up to and including their game against Stoke City on 26 December.

The Montenegrin has also been fined Â£21,000.

Osmajic, who "strongly refuted" and denied the allegations was charged by the Football Association (FA) in March with a hearing taking place in September.

The FA said, external that following the hearing, an "aggravated breach", where using abusive and/or insulting words which included reference to colour and/or race, was found to be proven.

In response,, external Preston said they were "extremely disappointed" by the decision and reaffirmed their opposition to all forms of discrimination.

"We note that the outcome was determined on the 'Balance of Probabilities' rather than one that is 'Beyond Reasonable Doubt'," the club added.

"We also note that the FA determined that this decision offers no moral judgement, was not premeditated nor any comment about his general character.

"Milutin has always pleaded his innocence of the charge and continues to do so. We continue to be fully supportive of our player."

Burnley, meanwhile, are yet to comment.

Beyond reasonable doubt is typically the burden of proof in criminal cases, while balance of probabilities is the civil one that would be used in such workplace disciplinary decisions.

February's Championship fixture was delayed for several minutes in the second half when the Tunisian reacted furiously to something which appeared to be said to him by Osmajic, while Hannibal then spoke at length to referee Andrew Kitchen.

Two weeks later, the teams faced each other in the FA Cup fifth round with Osmajic scoring Preston's second goal and gesturing towards the Burnley fans during his celebrations.

Hannibal was left out by Burnley boss Scott Parker for the tie, which Preston won 3-0, while the Clarets refused to shake hands with Osmajic during the pre-match preparations.

It is the second lengthy ban that Osmajic has been given in as many seasons, having received an eight-game suspension in 2024-25 for biting Blackburn Rovers' Owen Beck in September 2024.

The Montenegro international, who admitted that particular charge of violent conduct, was also fined Â£15,000.

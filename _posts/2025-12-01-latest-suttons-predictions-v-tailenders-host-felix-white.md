Experts revealed that Aston Villa are going for a fourth successive Premier League victory when they travel to Brighton on Wednesday, but should Unai Emery's side change the way they have been scoring goals on their winning run?

"There is apparently some debate about whether Villa's xG (expected goals) is unsustainable because they are scoring from long range, but that's nonsense," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.

"Villa have good players who can shoot from the edge of the box, so are you seriously going to tell them not to shoot now, because of xG? Give me a break."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For the midweek fixtures in week 14, he takes on musician, author and Fulham fan Felix White.

White is the guitarist with The Maccabees and 86TVs. His new book 'Whatever will be, will be: A Matter of Life and Football' is out now.

White's book follows his journey through the 2024-25 FA Cup campaign from the extra-preliminary round to the final at Wembley.

"It started accidentally when I was on tour with 86TVs, at Kendal Calling in the Lake District," White told BBC Sport. 

"I was having a weird day and, probably like many people reading this, when I am feeling like that I quite often go and find football or cricket. I find watching it just airbrushes me, and just changes my way of thinking about the world.

"I saw Penrith were playing down the road and we weren't on stage until after 6pm, so I worked out I'd just have enough time to get back afterwards. I watched the game in their ground surrounded by hills, and it gave me a sensation almost like I was watching football for the very first time.

"Anyway, I realised at the end that I couldn't get a taxi back to the festival so I had a bit of a panic, and I ended up getting a lift with a guy called Billy Williams, who turned out to be the chairman of Penrith.

"When I was in the car with him, all these stories came flooding out and it made me think that from a literary perspective, the FA Cup is quite a profound kind of framework.

"Because of what it means to people, I realised this was an adventure where I could write a book telling a story not just about English football, but about England itself."

Chris Sutton and Felix White were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Vitality Stadium, 19:30 GMT

This is a difficult one to start off with. Both teams suffered bad defeats at the weekend for different reasons.

Bournemouth let a two-goal lead slip as they went down 3-2 at Sunderland and have now lost three of their past four games.

At 2-2, Evanilson had a goal disallowed for offside when he tapped in a deflected cross which looked like it was heading in anyway. I was trying to think back to whether I'd have done the same thing as a striker and, yes, I would. Single-mindedness is what I'd call it.

Everton have surely got to defend better than they did in their 4-1 defeat by Newcastle. I just didn't expect to see them capitulate like that.

Bournemouth have started leaking a few goals recently too, so maybe there is some hope for one of Everton's less-than-prolific strikers to finally find the net - but I actually think this will be quite tight and the Cherries will edge it.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Felix's prediction: These two sides are going to level out and end up quite close to each other in the table by the end of the season, in eighth or ninth or something like that. I feel like they will closely matched on Tuesday, too. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Craven Cottage, 19:30

I am at this game for 5 Live. We had my predictions opponent Felix on the FPL Podcast last week and I know he will go for a Fulham win here - I really like him, and I enjoy listening to Tailenders, but I'm sorry to say he's going to get this prediction wrong.

Fulham's home form this season probably gives Felix some hope but their record against City is absolutely awful.

City have won their past 18 meetings in all competitions since 2012, which is the longest winning run by a team against any opponent in the entire history of English football, scoring 54 goals and conceding only seven.

I covered City against Leeds on Saturday and they got lucky, while away from home they have lost three times already. 

With the run they are on against Fulham, however, there is no way they won't win this game.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Felix's prediction: This is the only game I am going to call totally from my heart and not my head. We have beaten a lot of big teams recently, but we haven't beaten City for a long time, especially at the Cottage. That changes here, and in exactly the same way that we beat Liverpool in April. 

So, City are going to go 1-0 up then we will score three. They will nick one back and then there will be 10 minutes of manic defending, but we will hold on. 3-2

Felix on Fulham: It's been such a weird season because the table is so tight at the moment that one bad result makes everyone worry about relegation, and a couple of good ones, like we've just had, makes you think 'oh we're only five points from being fifth'.

AI's prediction: 1-3

St James' Park, 20:15

Tottenham boss Thomas Frank needs a result. He was so relaxed when he was at Brentford but now he just looks like a guy under pressure.

Frank saying the supporters who booed Guglielmo Vicario after his mistake against Fulham "can't be true Tottenham fans" underlines the friction he is feeling at the moment, but he does have a point about the effect that has.

As a player who has been booed a lot over the years, I can tell you that it doesn't have a positive impact on your performance. Being serious, though, I just don't get it - it just creates negativity.

The Spurs players will probably be relieved to be playing away after that, but Newcastle have found a bit of form in the past week so this is not an easy trip at all.

Tottenham have already lost at St James' Park this season in the Carabao Cup, and I am going for a repeat result, by the same scoreline.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Felix's prediction: It feels like Newcastle are just starting to go through the gears. In contrast, with the amount of games Spurs have got and the form they are in, they are going to be struggling. 3-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Emirates Stadium, 19:30

Chelsea were down to 10 men for an hour on Sunday so I was a little bit surprised Arsenal did not go for it more.

There has been legitimate criticism of Gunners boss Mikel Arteta in the past about him being too negative, and I don't think they went for the jugular at Stamford Bridge.

If it was 11 versus 11 then a 1-1 draw there is not a bad result at all, because Chelsea are a good team, but are Arsenal making the most of these opportunities? I am not sure.

Still, I think they will bounce back and beat Brentford, and I can see them getting a few goals this time.

We know the Bees will sit in and try to hit them on the counter with balls in behind for Igor Thiago, but I don't think it will work.

Sutton's prediction: 3-0

Felix's prediction: Arsenal are going to win this, aren't they? They just look so professional and so solid. 

They are going to be absolutely cruising in the title race until February or March and then if Manchester City or Chelsea, or whoever it is, are within five or six points then they might feel the pressure. I can see them losing a game or two then, but only if anyone is still close to them. 

For now, though, I don't see anyone beating them. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Amex Stadium, 19:30

Villa are playing well right now but this is a tough trip for them and with their heavy schedule it might be a game too far. 

Brighton are in great form too, especially at home. Their boss Fabian Hurzeler has done a great job there.

The Seagulls have got plenty of firepower and a strong squad so, on that basis, I am going to back them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Felix's prediction: Brighton are in really good form. Villa are too, but I think the games might catch up with them here. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Turf Moor, 19:30

Manchester United did not have to play particularly well to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, and Eagles boss Oliver Glasner moaned afterwards about the club's failure to bring players in over the summer.

When a manager does that, I start to wonder how long he will hang around. I get it - you have to leave when your stock is high, and Glasner's certainly is at the moment.

He is right, though, because their squad is stretched. Glasner must have been listening to the Monday Night Club because I've been saying the same thing since the start of the season, about how they are going to come a cropper because it is very difficult to compete without that depth.

I still think Palace will win this game though, because Burnley are in a bit of bother.

Scott Parker's side don't score enough goals so it was real blow for them to get level at Brentford with five minutes to go on Saturday and still get nothing from the game.

I have a feeling they will battle away here too, and then see Palace sneak it late on.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Felix's prediction: Palace also have played loads of games and I had a feeling they would struggle against Manchester United before they lost on Sunday. I still think they will win this one though. It feels like Burnley ship goals at the end of games, because they don't quite last the pace. 1-3

Felix on being at Wembley when Palace won last season's FA Cup: I had so many mad journeys and adventures in the book, and it almost became about finding the game that had the story behind it that had nothing to do with football, but was about the people I met or even me personally. 

But I do have to say that being among the Palace fans at Wembley was honestly the closest thing I've seen to an actual religious experience. 

The sense that they were doing something by winning their first major trophy that their parents or grandparents who supported Palace couldn't see, was incredible. It captured the very essence of the book because I was looking for the magic of the FA Cup and I found it right there. Even talking about it now, I still get shivers.

AI's prediction: 1-1

Molineux, 19:30

Wolves actually played all right against Aston Villa on Sunday but they still lost again.

There are six months of the season left to play but, let's face it, they've had it. 

They still only have two points from their first 13 games, and there is no way Rob Edwards can rescue them from here. 

They could bring in Pep Guardiola, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho - three of the great Premier League managers - and they still wouldn't keep them up.

Wolves do have something to play for, though. I didn't think any team could be as bad as Robbie Savage's Derby County side that went down with a record Premier League low of 11 points in 2007-08, so beating that total is maybe their only aim now.

Nottingham Forest's defeat by Brighton on Sunday was a bit of a sickener for Sean Dyche, because he had made such a good start there. 

His team should be too streetwise for Wolves, though.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Felix's prediction: It's hard to see Wolves winning a game at the moment. 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-1

Elland Road, 20:15

Leeds lumped it in the second half against Manchester City and it almost got them a point. 

They were lucky to still be in the game at half-time but fair play to Daniel Farke for making the substitutes and changing the system, because he has been accused of not being proactive enough during games.

As lively as Leeds were, they still ended up empty-handed, however, and it means they really need something here. 

You know they will give it a go but, again, it is going to be hard for them to get anything out of a Chelsea side who are in really good form.

There might be a bit of an edge to this one, because going back to my time as a Chelsea player there was always a rivalry here. 

I don't think it will be as rough and tumble as it was when these teams met in the 1970 FA Cup final, but I'm going for the same outcome, which is a Chelsea win.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Felix's prediction: I am going to call a mad one here for the sake of it. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-2

Anfield, 20:15

I got Liverpool wrong at the weekend because I thought they would lose at West Ham.

Instead of Mo Salah, it was a case of 'No Salah' after he was left out for their 2-0 win. I didn't mind seeing that, because Salah is no different from any other player - if he is not performing, you drop him.

I was wrong about Sunderland too, but that won't surprise anyone. 

We are at the stage where I am thinking should I do Black Cats fans a favour by tipping them to lose again here, because we know what happens when I do that - they win.

I actually think they will give a good account of themselves at Anfield and it would not surprise me at all to see them going there and winning - I really mean that, too, because we've all seen how capable Regis le Bris' side are.

I am still going to go with Liverpool though. I don't think they can be as bad as they were in their last two home games, against Nottingham Forest and PSV Eindhoven.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Felix's prediction: When Sunderland came to Craven Cottage last week they let us have a lot of the ball. It was like they were thinking they could sting us on the counter-attack but they almost looked like they were going to get found out. We had 20-odd chances, so I can't believe Liverpool won't do the same. 2-0

AI's prediction: 3-1

Old Trafford, 20:00

Manchester United fought back to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday but they didn't really deserve it.

They are still a basket case of a club, and you could say the same about West Ham.

How can I predict what Ruben Amorim's side will do? No-one can. I can't get my head around them.

There is no reason to back them here, or West Ham either. The Hammers pushed Liverpool close on Sunday, but they did not really threaten very much despite the Reds being so vulnerable defensively at the moment.

There definitely won't be many goals in this game, but I already know I am going to be wrong about it.

In fact, I wish I didn't have to make a prediction here, but I've been told I have to.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Felix's prediction: I am going to say Nuno Espirito Santo gets a point. 0-0

AI's prediction: 2-2

There was a three-way tie for victory at the weekend, but Chris was not involved.

He got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 13, for a total of 30 points.

Instead, the win was shared between the BBC readers, AI and Chris' guest - rapper Kofi Stone.

They all got four correct results, with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.

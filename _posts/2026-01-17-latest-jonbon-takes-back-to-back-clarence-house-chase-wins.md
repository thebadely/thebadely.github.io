Experts revealed that Jonbon (right) edged ahead of Thistle Ask in the final stages

Jonbon made it back-to-back victories in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot as favourite Il Etait Temps fell at the second-to-last fence.

Drama before the start saw James Bowen take Jonbon's saddle after intended rider Harry Cobden had to be assessed for injury following an earlier race.

In a four-horse field, Jonbon swept clear of Thistle Ask as the pair headed towards the finish line.

Willie Mullins-trained Il Etait Temps had been expected to make it six straight wins and started the race as 2-5 favourite.

Jonbon's trainer, Nicky Henderson, admitted he had not expected the 10-year-old to take victory as they approached the final stretch of the Grade One two-miler, but he believed stamina helped him.

Speaking to ITV, he said: "I came in here thinking his record of never being out of the first two was under big threat. I really did fear that.

"He was amazing. That was an end-to-end gallop. It seemed to test them all. I thought he was beaten three out, but then he keeps going.

"He was a very fast horse. Now he's not as fast as he was, but his stamina kicks in. He's got older legs, but he's brave, he jumps.

"You've got to be proud of him. That was a brave boy to come and do that."

He was unsure, though, when asked whether Jonbon would now be a Cheltenham Champion Chase contender.

"I'd love to be trying him over further [distances], but things have invariably gone wrong [when I have]," Henderson said.

Gidleigh Park pulled up with six fences to go, but a fall for Il Etait Temps proved a bigger shock.

Ridden by Paul Townend, the grey had beaten Jonbon in their previous two encounters.

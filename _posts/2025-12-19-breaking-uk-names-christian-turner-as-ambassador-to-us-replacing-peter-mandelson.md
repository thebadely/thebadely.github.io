Here’s what you need to know: The UK has named career diplomat Christian Turner as its new ambassador to the US, Downing Street has confirmed.

The previous ambassador, Lord Peter Mandelson, was sacked by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer after evidence, including emails and photos, emerged showing his continued association with the paedophile Jeffery Epstein.

Turner has spent nearly 30 years working across Whitehall and the Foreign Office.

As the new ambassador in Washington, he will have to navigate relations with the Trump administration, which have been partly strained by disagreements over how to handle the war in Ukraine, as well as President Donald Trump's criticism of Europe.

The White House said it looked "forward to working with Ambassador Turner to further enhance the strong relationship between the United States ‍and United ‌Kingdom", according to a statement sent to Reuters news agency.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that King Charles had formally appointed Turner, and the UK would now seek official approval - or agrément - for his appointment from the US.

Turner said he was "honoured" to be nominated for the position. 

"At a pivotal time for the transatlantic relationship, I look forward to working with President Trump's administration, and leaders in Congress, business and society to strengthen that bond in the years ahead," he said. 

Turner will face a heavy load of diplomatic tasks when he takes up the role.

Chiefly among them is working with the US on Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine, which European nations fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.

Earlier this month, a US national security strategy document - signed by Trump - argued that Europe was facing "civilisational erasure" and questioned whether certain European countries could remain reliable allies.

Turner will also have to work to secure a long-anticipated but delayed tech deal with the US, amid concerns from some White House and congressional officials who have been critical of the UK's online safety laws. Some have characterised those regulations as "censorship" and legal overreach that impacts US firms.

Sir Keir's government has pushed for close ties with Trump, hosting him on a second state visit in September, during which Trump praised the "unbreakable bond" between the US and UK.

But just days before Trump arrived, Sir Keir sacked Lord Mandelson after revelations over his friendship to Epstein. Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.

The Foreign Office reportedly pushed hard for a diplomatically experienced figure to be appointed as the new ambassador. 

Turner's previous roles include political director at the Foreign Office, British High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Foreign Office Director for the Middle East and North Africa. He also previously worked in 10 Downing Street as private secretary to the prime minister.

Before entering government, he worked in television documentaries.

In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Sir Keir said: "The United Kingdom and United States have a very special relationship, and Christian's extensive experience as an outstanding diplomat will support this uniquely close bond and ensure it continues to flourish."

Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Turner would bring "exceptional diplomatic experience and deep understanding" to the role. 

Ambassador to the US is seen as one of the UK's top diplomatic postings.

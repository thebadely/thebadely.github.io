Let's dive into the details: Kenya's Mary Moraa beat Keely Hodgkinson to 800m gold at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest

The 20th World Athletics Championships take place in Tokyo from 13-21 September and will be shown live on the BBC.

Great Britain and Northern Ireland equalled their best haul of 10 medals to finish seventh at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, bringing home two gold medals, three silvers and five bronze.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson (heptathlon) and Josh Kerr (1500m) will seek to defend their titles in Japan, while Keely Hodgkinson (800m) and Matthew Hudson-Smith (400m) will hope to go from silver to gold this year.

Zharnel Hughes (100m) and Ben Pattison (800m) won bronze medals two years ago, while Britain collected four medals from the five relay events.

Among the global stars competing will be pole vault world record holder Armand Duplantis, world and Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles and five-time 100m world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in her final championships before retiring.

There are 49 gold medals up for grabs over nine days at the 67,750-capacity Japan National Stadium.

You can follow all the action on BBC One or BBC Two, while there is also live coverage on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

There will also be a daily highlights show on BBC Red Button, BBC Three, iPlayer and online.

The BBC Sport website will have daily live text commentaries, video highlights, analysis, reports and results.

BBC Radio 5 Live will bring you live commentary from Japan throughout the nine days.

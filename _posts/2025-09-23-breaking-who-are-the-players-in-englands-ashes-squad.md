Let's dive into the details: England have named a 16-player squad as they look to regain the Ashes in Australia this winter.

The series starts on 21 November, with the fifth and final Test beginning on 4 January. 

The core of England's group is settled, with all-rounder Will Jacks the surprise inclusion as the second spinner. 

BBC Sport profiles each of the players, looks at their Test career and previous record in Australia. 

Tests: 115, Runs: 7,032, Average: 35.69, Wickets: 230, Average: 31.64

England's talismanic leader sat out of the final Test against India with a shoulder injury but the 34-year-old was back training in early September. 

Stokes has also had two serious hamstring injuries in the past couple of years and England's chances are likely to hinge on his availability. 

He has played nine Tests in Australia and averages 28.61 with the bat, while he's claimed 19 wickets at 40.94.

His presence is key to England's ability to balance the side and he was arguably the pick of their bowlers this summer.  

Tests: 38, Runs: 2,872, Average: 42.86, Centuries: Six

The 30-year-old will open the batting for England and has played a pivotal role with his counter-attacking style under Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes. 

He's having a fine 2024 too, averaging 60.20, but he's yet to play a Test in Australia. 

The left-hander averaged 35.66 in the five-Test home series against Australia in 2023. 

Tests: 59, Runs: 3,313, Average: 31.55, Centuries: Five

The right-hander has come under external pressure for his place in the side after a lean couple of years, but England have stuck by him with this series in mind.

They believe the quicker, bouncier pitches in Australia will suit Crawley and his naturally aggressive style can put the hosts on the back foot.

He averaged 27.66 in three Tests on the last tour down under. 

Ollie Pope has lost the vice-captaincy to Harry Brook

Tests: 61, Runs: 3,607, Average: 35.36, Centuries: Nine

Another whose place has come under scrutiny, but having filled in as captain when Stokes was injured he was always going to be part of the group. 

However, Pope has lost the vice-captaincy to white-ball skipper Harry Brook for this series.

Pope will act as the back-up wicketkeeper in case of any injury or illness to Jamie Smith.

He's averaged 47.70 so far in 2025, but that is boosted by 171 against Zimbabwe. 

The right-hander has played three Tests in Australia and averages a measly 11.16.  

Tests: 158, Runs: 13,543, Average: 51.29, Centuries: 39

England's Mr Reliable, but not always in Australia.

He may be England's all-time leading run-scorer but he's yet to score a century in 14 Tests in Australia. 

The right-hander averages 35.68 in that time, but let's hope that first century comes or we'll have to deal with a naked Matthew Hayden, external walking round the MCG in Melbourne. 

Tests: 30, Runs: 2,820, Average: 57.55, Centuries: 10

Perhaps England's X-factor with the bat. He can produce a sensational innings but can also frustrate with rash shots at times. 

The right-hander averages 53.90 this year and had a decent 2023 Ashes with an average of 40.33 in five games. 

This will be his first taste of Ashes cricket in Australia.

Jacob Bethell made scores of six and five in his last Test against India

Tests: Four, Runs: 271, Average: 38.71, Centuries: None

The 21-year-old is likely to be England's spare batter. He impressed during a debut series against New Zealand last winter but has had a frustrating summer with limited opportunities.

He scored his first professional century in a one-day international against South Africa earlier this month though and England would feel comfortable picking him if needed. 

Tests: 15, Runs: 1,075, Average: 48.86, Centuries: Two, Dismissals: 54

Smith has been very accomplished with the gloves and bat since making his Test debut in 2024.

However, by the end of the first five-Test series this summer he did look fatigued and frazzled. 

England's aggressive style with the bat means he could spend most - if not all - days in the field in the series so it could be another learning curve on his first tour of Australia. 

Tests: Two, Runs: 89, Average: 22.25, Wickets: Six, Average: 38.66

The wildcard in the squad, with Jacks' two previous Tests coming in Pakistan as a second spin option in December 2022. 

However, the Surrey man has been picked over Leicestershire's Rehan Ahmed, Hampshire's Liam Dawson or out-and-out spinner Jack Leach as the second spin option.

He will offer England depth with the bat but his spin is untested really. 

He has bowled just 74 overs in the County Championship this season, taking five wickets at 38.80. 

Jofra Archer took nine wickets in two Tests against India after a four-year gap between red-ball appearances for England

Tests: 15, Wickets: 51, Average: 30.62, Best figures: 6-45

Definitely the X-factor with the ball. A series of injuries have hampered Archer's Test career but his long-awaited return against India this summer was undoubtedly a success.

He will have to be carefully managed throughout the series - and how England do that may determine their chances. 

The right-armer is yet to play a Test in Australia, but enjoyed success with 22 wickets in his debut series in 2019. 

Tests: 37, Wickets: 119, Average: 30.42, Best figures: 6-37

England's prime speedster, but can they get him on the field? His last Test was in August 2024 and he hasn't played any cricket since February after surgery on a knee injury.

He was targeting a couple of matches for Durham before the end of the season but that now seems unlikely. He's been left out of the white-ball squads for New Zealand in October too so he'll be relying on the warm-up game against England Lions to get up to speed.

The right-armer picked up 17 wickets in four Tests during the last Ashes down under.

Tests: Nine, Wickets: 36, Average: 30.11, Best figures: 6-42

The Durham seamer has been impressive since his debut last summer and his style of banging the ball into the pitch could bring rewards in Australia. 

He is unlikely to make it through all five Tests though, so England will again have to decide where he'll be most effective. 

This will be first taste of Ashes cricket. 

Tests: 13, Wickets: 63, Average: 22.01, Best figures: 7-45

The Surrey seamer provided a pretty quick reminder of his ability and threat when he returned for the final Test against India in July.

Atkinson has been superb since being introduced to the Test fold in 2024 and he looks set to take the new ball in Australia and could be the leader of the attack in his first Ashes series. 

Tests: Six, Wickets: 31, Average: 30.00, Best figures: 5-66

The Nottinghamshire seamer impressed against India this summer. There were questions about his ability against the top order but he grew as the series progressed and was a banker for this squad. 

He played one Test in the 2023 series against Australia, taking five wickets, but this will be his first taste of conditions down under. 

Matthew Potts' previous Tests have come in England, New Zealand and Pakistan

Tests: 10, Wickets: 36, Average: 29.44, Best figures: 7-68

The outsider who has forced his way in.

It seemed like Potts had fallen out of favour but the Durham man is included over Chris Woakes, whose record overseas isn't as strong as at home and is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained against India in August. 

Potts has taken 28 wickets in 10 County Championship matches at 39.60 this summer. 

This will be first taste of Ashes cricket. 

Tests: 19, Wickets: 68, Average: 39.00, Best figures: 6-81

The 21-year-old will be England's frontline spinner in the Ashes.

He's had a successful start to his Test career and became the youngest Englishman to take 50 Test wickets, but he can be expensive and has been targeted by some sides. 

That is likely to be the case for some of Australia's batters, including dangerous middle-order batter Travis Head, so how Bashir and England can limit the damage will be important.  

He could also be rusty having missed the final two Tests of the summer with a broken finger. It means the warm-up in Australia will be his only cricket in the past four months by the time the first Test starts in Perth.

Let's dive into the details: Elle McDonald was named player of the match as Cardiff Dragons secured their first win

Cardiff Dragons claimed their first win of the Netball Super League season as they beat Birmingham Panthers on Friday.

Having started the campaign with seven straight losses, the Dragons overcame a narrow half-time deficit to secure a 61-57 victory at the Skydome Arena.

The Panthers led 34-32 at midway point and were still a point up at the end of the third quarter.

It was level at 57-57 with five minutes remaining but the Dragons edged ahead through goal attack Phillipa Yarranton and she added a super shot to extend the lead.

Goal shooter Georgia Rowe, who top-scored for the Dragons with 39 goals, wrapped up the win for the Super League's last-place side.

The Panthers had a marginally better shooting success rate, 86% to the Dragons' 85%, with Sigi Burger scoring 46 goals, but were outshot 67 to 55 by the visitors.

Dragons are now just four points behind Panthers in seventh.

It has been recently reported that Allan Saint-Maximin took to Instagram to denounce comments made to his children

Former Newcastle United winger Allan Saint-Maximin has left Mexican side Club America by mutual consent after saying his children were the victims of racist abuse.

Saint-Maximin, 28, had previously posted on social media about his family being targeted.

"The problem is not the colour of your skin, it's the colour of your thoughts," the Frenchman wrote on Instagram.

"I'm being attacked, not a problem - I grew up, I learned to fight against attacks... but there's one thing I will never tolerate is my kids being picked on."

He said protecting his children was his priority and that he would "fight to make sure they are respected and loved, regardless of their background or colour of their skin".

"Hate and discrimination has no place in our society," he added.

Saint-Maximin has also played for Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahli and Fenerbahce in Turkey since leaving St James' Park in 2023.

Club America coach Andre Jardine described Saint-Maximin as a "fantastic" player with "the ability to play in any league in the world".

"We wish him all the best," he added.

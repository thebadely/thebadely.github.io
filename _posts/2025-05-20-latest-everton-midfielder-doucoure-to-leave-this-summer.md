According to new developments, AbdoulayeÂ Doucoure waved to fans when he was replaced in the 65th minute of Sunday's Premier League win over Southampton

Everton midfielder AbdoulayeÂ Doucoure has announced he will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of the season. 

The 32-year-old Mali player has made 165 appearances for the Toffees since joining from Watford for Â£20m in September 2020. 

Doucoure has scored 21 goals for Everton, including a memorable winner in their 1-0 victory over Bournemouth when the club avoided relegation on the final day of the 2022-23 season.

He joins veteran midfielder Ashley Young and goalkeepers Asmir Begovic and Joao Virginia in leaving, while forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin, midfielder Idrissa Gueye and defenders Michael Keane and Seamus Coleman are also out of contract this summer.

In a video posted on social media, Doucoure said: "HiÂ EvertoniansÂ - just wanted to share this message with you that I'm going to leave the football club at the end of the season. 

"AfterÂ fiveÂ wonderfulÂ years,Â myÂ timeÂ atÂ Everton cameÂ toÂ anÂ end.

"EvertonÂ meansÂ aÂ lotÂ forÂ me.Â ObviouslyÂ theÂ pastÂ fiveÂ yearsÂ it'sÂ beenÂ hardÂ but I will always remember my time as a dream for me, to play for Everton Football Club. 

"ObviouslyÂ I'mÂ sadÂ toÂ leaveÂ theÂ clubÂ butÂ IÂ thinkÂ theÂ timeÂ hasÂ comeÂ forÂ aÂ new chapter for me and the club as well and I will always be grateful for what the club did for me.

"MyÂ bestÂ memory,Â IÂ willÂ sayÂ itÂ willÂ beÂ theÂ goalÂ IÂ scoredÂ againstÂ Bournemouth to keep the club in the Premier League. I think this is something I will always be proud [of]. It was a wonderful moment for me and my family and for the club as well. 

"IÂ willÂ missÂ theÂ fans.Â IÂ willÂ missÂ theÂ footballÂ club.Â IÂ justÂ wantedÂ toÂ let them know that I gave everything every single time in training, in games.

"I was always proud to wear the shirts, always proud to play at Goodison Park."

The midfielder looked emotional as he was substituted in the second half of Sunday's 2-0 victory over Southampton - Everton's final game at their Goodison Park home.

The Toffees will travel to Newcastle for their last match of the campaign this Sunday (16:00 BST) before relocating to their new Hill Dickinson Stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock. 

Doucoure added: "I gave everything to win the most games I could and I will just miss the place, and I wish them all the best in the new stadium.

"EvertonÂ willÂ alwaysÂ beÂ partÂ ofÂ myÂ lifeÂ now.Â IÂ willÂ beÂ foreverÂ aÂ Blue.Â IÂ will always support Everton and I hope they're going to have a bright future."

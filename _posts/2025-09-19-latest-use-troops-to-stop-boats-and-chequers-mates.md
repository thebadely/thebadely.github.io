Experts revealed that The meeting at Chequers between Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer dominates the front pages, with many focusing on the US president's suggestion that the UK should use the military to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. 

The Telegraph says Trump's advice - to directly involve the army - would go "much further" than the steps planned by the government.

The Times states that Trump went out of his way not to sour the tone at the end of the historic state visit, avoiding criticising the prime minister over free speech and attempting to defuse the scandal over the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US Ambassador.

The Guardian agrees that Trump avoided exploiting tensions, during what the newspaper describes as a potentially difficult state visit for the government.

In its headline, the Daily Mail declares "Trump shows PM who's boss", describing it as a "bullish display" by the US president that "clearly showed who was in the driving seat."

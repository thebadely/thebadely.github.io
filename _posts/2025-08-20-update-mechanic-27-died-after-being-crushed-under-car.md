It has been recently reported that A mechanic died after being crushed under a car he was working on, an inquest has heard.

Daniel Burton, 27, from Port Talbot, was found unresponsive underneath a car belonging to his partner's father on Southall Avenue, Skewen, Neath, on 22 January.

Mr Burton lived with his partner Abbie, her daughter Maddie-Mae, and had another child Benny, in what the hearing at Swansea Coroner's Court heard was a "lovely little family bubble".

A coroner concluded Mr Burton's death was accidental as the axle stand which was holding up the vehicle had tipped onto its side, trapping him underneath.

Mr Burton had qualified as a mechanic prior going to work at the Port Talbot steelworks, before taking voluntary redundancy.

He was about to pass his MOT testers course at Bridgend College when the accident happened.

The inquest heard how two passers-by found him trapped underneath the Audi A3 and raised the alarm.

During the hearing, Det Con Kelly Hurley said Mr Burton's partner had told him not to do the work on the car himself because it was "a big job" and it was "too dark" outside.

A neighbour who had seen him working on the car had considered warning him that it looked unsafe because the vehicle was parked on a slope.

However, she decided against approaching him, as she felt he may not have "appreciated" the advice.

At about 18:30 GMT two women who were looking for their car which had been stolen spotted Mr Burton under the Audi, and went to ask him whether he had seen their vehicle.

He did not respond, which is when they noticed that he was pinned underneath the car he had been working on.

The inquest heard that a neighbour used a jack to lift the vehicle off Mr Burton's body in order to pull him out from underneath.

The emergency services were called and a paramedic declared he had died at 18:53.

House-to-house and forensic enquiries were carried out and police decided there were no suspicious circumstances.

A post-mortem examination concluded Mr Burton died as a result of traumatic asphyxia.

"This is also known as crush asphyxia," said Coroner Colin Phillips, adding: "Which sometimes happens in sports stadiums."

He recorded a conclusion of accidental death and offered his condolences to Mr Burton's family.

"He was very much loved and will be sorely missed and I hope you get a degree of closure now," Mr Phillips added.

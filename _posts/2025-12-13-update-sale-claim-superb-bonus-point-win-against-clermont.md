Sale Sharks clinched an impressive bonus-point win against Clermont Auvergne to boost their hopes of qualifying from Pool One of the Investec Champions Cup.

Sale led 20-7 at half-time, outscoring their opponents by three tries to one in the first period despite the French side enjoying greater territory.

Tom O'Flaherty went over inside two minutes and although Yerim Fall replied for the hosts, Sale moved clear with scores by Marius Louw and Arron Reed.

Reed was yellow-carded early in the second half for making head-to-head contact with Sebastien Bezy when attempting a clearout at a ruck - an incident which meant Jacques Vermeulen's try was disallowed.

Lucas Zamora crossed for Clermont while Sale were down to 14 men, reducing the deficit to six.

But, after surviving a spell of pressure from the hosts, Sale then scored 15 points without reply to secure an emphatic victory.

The visitors took advantage of a loose Clermont pass to secure a try bonus point, with centre Joe Bedlow touching down on his Champions Cup debut, before Alex Wills' fine finish rounded off the scoring.

All the Champions Cup team news and line-ups in one place

A record of two wins from four pool matches has usually been good enough for a team to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions Cup.

Sale were on the back foot having lost their opening game at home to Glasgow and, given their final pool match is a daunting-looking trip to six-time winners Toulouse, the pressure was on to gain a positive result.

Rob du Preez again started at fly-half with England's George Ford still injured, and he made the final passes for the first-half tries scored by O'Flaherty and Reed.

Scrum-half Raffi Quirke was the chief architect of Louw's score, darting through Clermont's line in the middle of the field to create an opening which the South African centre finished off.

Quirke's intercepted pass led to Zamora's reply, which could have been a turning point, but Sale were able to keep Clermont at bay in defence and were clinical when opportunities came at the other end.

In the January block of matches, Sale host South African side Sharks and then end the pool phase with a trip to Toulouse.

Alex Sanderson's side, seventh in the Prem, return to league action on Saturday, 20 December when they visit Northampton Saints.

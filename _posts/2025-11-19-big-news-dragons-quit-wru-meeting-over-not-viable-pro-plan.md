It has been recently reported that David Wright became Dragons co-owner in 2023

Dragons say Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) plans for the professional game are "not viable or desirable" after walking out of a meeting with the governing body.

The Rodney Parade club's chairman David Wright and chief executive Rhys Blumberg left shortly after the start of discussions with the WRU at Principality Stadium on 6 November.

Blumberg has since held talks with the Union as Dragons' representative at Professional Rugby Board (PRB) meetings.

The WRU has proposed cutting one of the current four professional men's teams â Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets â by 2027, and potentially by the start of next season.

There is set to be one in the west, one in Cardiff and one in the east, but Dragons have major concerns over the Union's demand to take control of rugby matters and leave clubs with just the commercial responsibilities.

"At the Dragons there is no prospect of signing up to any structure that strips the club of control over what happens on the field," said chairman David Wright.

The Union said its team of Dave Reddin, Leighton Davies and Malcolm Wall has now met with each of the four regional clubs to discuss the next steps.

"Subsequent meetings have been held with each of the clubs (including the Dragons) to discuss the WRU's whole-system approach to elite rugby, aimed at delivering long-term success through alignment across all levels of the game and financial sustainability," a statement said.

The WRU announced plans to cut to three teams on 24 October after a consultation period on previous proposals to go down to as few as two.

The governing body then held talks with all the professional clubs and Dragons state that they expected a "constructive and meaningful" engagement.

"Under the current WRU proposals professional clubs would have no control over rugby decisions including coaching, player recruitment and selection," read a club statement.

"For Dragons RFC this is not viable or desirable, but we have consistently sought a constructive discussion on how to improve the Union's plans.

"Shortly after the meeting started, it became clear and apparent that the WRU was not inclined to make amendments to their proposed governance arrangements. We therefore left the meeting soon after.

"In short, nothing had changed, the WRU was still insisting on controlling all rugby related matters and demanding that they directly employ all players, coaches and all support staff.

"Central management by the WRU of all rugby operations is not acceptable, nor is it in the interests of club owners, who expect to be fully responsible and accountable for rugby operations, a key and fundamental element of the club and business we bought."

Dragons say they are also unhappy with "a new set of financial commitments demanded from owners... which are both unacceptable and off-market" that they had been unaware of prior to receiving documents from the WRU on 6 November.

Dragons were WRU-owned from 2017 until 2023 when then chairman David Buttress, Wright and Hoyoung Huh completed a takeover.

The deal included the nine-acre Rodney Parade site, which is the only stadium suitable for top level professional sport in the south east of Wales.

"Supporters understand instinctively that their team must be selected by their own club. They will not throw their heart behind a side assembled anywhere other than Rodney Parade," said Wright.

"We will go on pressing for a settlement that respects supporters, serves the club and strengthens the national game.

"The WRU must now pause, think again and reconsider both its position on governance and the financial terms it has placed on the table."

Dragons endured a winless first block in the United Rugby Championship (URC) and have not won in the URC since the opening weekend of last season.

The WRU statement added: "It is clear from club results that the current system does not work.

"It is now more important than ever that everyone in Welsh rugby works together in the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose. 

"Our collective focus must be on the good of the whole system and the future of the game in Wales - including how we manage elite rugby, critical investment in the player pathway, development structures, the grassroots game, the women's game, coaching investment and Super Rygbi Cymru."

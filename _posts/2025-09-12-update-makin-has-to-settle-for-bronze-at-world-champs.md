According to new developments, Callum Makin's opponent Rami Kiwan boxed at the 2024 Paris Olympics

Callum Makin had to settle for a bronze medal at the World Boxing Championships after a semi-final defeat in the men's 75kg division.

The 21-year-old middleweight was beaten by Rami Kiwan at the M&S Arena in Liverpool on Friday - the judge scoring all five rounds to his Bulgarian opponent.

Makin's fellow Liverpudlian Odel Kamara is one of four other British fighters already guaranteed bronze before their semi-finals at the weekend.

Kamara faces Torekhan Sabyrkhan of Kazakhstan on Saturday in the men's 70kg semi-final after his win over Mongolia's Byamba-Erdene Otgonbaatar.

Teagn Stott is through to the semi-finals in the men's 85kg following a second-round stoppage against Semion Boldirev of Bulgaria and will now take on Ukrainian Danylo Zhasan.

Elsewhere, Chantelle Reid will square up against Natalya Bogdanova in the semi-finals of the women's 70kg after beating Mengge Zhang.

Emily Asquith beat Turkey's Elif Guneri in the women's 80kg to secure a last-four meeting with India's Pooja Rani.

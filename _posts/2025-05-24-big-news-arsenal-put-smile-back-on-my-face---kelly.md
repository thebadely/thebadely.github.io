Arsenal put the smile back on my face - Kelly

Chloe Kelly said she considered taking a break from football before Arsenal "put the smile back on my face" and transformed her difficult season "from a real low to a real high".

Kelly started Saturday's Champions League final as the Gunners stunned holders Barcelona to win a first European title in 18 years.

The England international came through the Gunners' youth ranks between 2010 and 2015 and was given a chance back at the club after struggling for game time with Manchester City, making just one start in the WSL before her deadline day loan move to north London.

She said she "wanted to be happy again" in a social media post and then-City boss Gareth Taylor said it was "really disappointing" how the bitter transfer saga between Kelly and the club came to an end.

"I said I was coming to this club to find happiness with football and I have a medal round my neck," an emotional Kelly told BBC Sport's Jo Currie. "Every day that I come into the club I'm smiling. They put the smile back on my face so I will forever be grateful for that.

"I took a step to try and make things better for myself and I'm grateful for the people around me that supported me to take that step. This one is for everyone that helped me do that."

Kelly has made 13 appearances in all competitions since re-joining Arsenal, scoring twice.

She helped the Gunners secure a second-placed WSL finish and now has Saturday's triumph in Lisbon to celebrate.

"Definitely up there," Kelly, who scored England's winning goal in the Euro 2022 final, added on where the victory ranks. "The journey it has taken to get here, it's definitely been a battle.

"Now to celebrate this moment with the girls, with Arsenal Football Club but also my family that have been there through the dark days to now, I'm just really grateful."

On whether taking a break from football was a real option before her January move, Kelly said: "It definitely was. I don't think people understand at times the emotions that sometimes go through people's minds.

"It's hard to explain but we're here now and we're at the other side of it. It's football, sometimes there's high, there's lows and there's bits in between. From a real low to a real high, I am very grateful for Renee Slegers.

"The first thing I said to Renee when we beat Lyon in the semi-final was 'thank you for this opportunity'."

Kelly's contract at City expires in June and her loan move was only until the end of the season.

On whether fans can expect to see her in an Arsenal shirt again next season, she added: "Who knows. I just know I have given my all for the club and the club has given their all for me, so I'm always grateful."

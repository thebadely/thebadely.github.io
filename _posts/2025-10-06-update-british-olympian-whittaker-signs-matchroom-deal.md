Let's dive into the details: Ben Whittaker signed his first professional deal with Boxxer in 2022

British Olympic silver medallist Ben Whittaker has signed a long-term deal with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing.

The 28-year-old won light-heavyweight silver at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before turning professional in 2022.

He has an unbeaten 9-0-1 record in his professional career, with six of those wins within the distance.

"I think things happen for a reason. I'm at the right stage in my career now to pick the right platform and go for the right fights. So this move just made sense," said Whittaker.

Hearn described Whittaker as a " generational talent" who has "the world at his feet".

"This long-term deal will propel Ben to global superstardom, solidifying his reputation as a household name and steering him towards future world titles. He will be number one," added Hearn.

Whittaker's last match was a second-round stoppage of Liam Cameron in their light-heavyweight rematch in April.

The first bout in October 2024 ended in a controversial draw, when both men fell over the ropes and Whittaker was unable to continue because of an injury.

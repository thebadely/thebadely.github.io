Experts revealed that Lauren Henry claimed Great Britain's eighth medal of the World Rowing Championships

Lauren Henry said she was "sad" to miss out on a first ever women's single sculls gold for Great Britain after being edged out by Ireland's Fiona Murtagh in a photo finish on the final day of the World Rowing Championships in Shanghai.

Henry's silver medal was Britain's eighth of the championships, the most of any competing nation, with a total of three golds, four silver and one bronze. 

Only the Netherlands finished with more gold medals - with four.

Henry, 23, had won a medal in every international race she competed in this year, while 30-year-old Murtagh had never before won a major regatta.

But after opening a big lead with a blistering start, Murtagh hung on as Henry reeled her in in the final 500m, with the Briton eventually losing by just 0.03 seconds.

"Obviously, I'm really pleased to come away with a medal, but it is disappointing," said Henry. 

"I said I was coming here for the gold and it's sad to miss out by less than a centimetre.

"I'm going to use this during the winter and come back better and stronger next season. Hopefully I can win that elusive women's single sculling gold for Great Britain at a World Championships."

Murtagh paid tribute to "phenomenal athlete" Henry, saying she was in shock after her name came up as the winner. 

She told World Rowing: "I dug deep and crossed the line and we were right beside each other, I really didn't know who'd won it until I looked at the screen and saw my name. I've never won a major regatta. This is huge and I'm in shock."

Louise Kingsley, the British team's director of performance, said that the championships marked a successful "start to the LA cycle", as GB's rowers target the next Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028. 

"Of the 37 athletes who made the podium, we have 21 athletes who are bringing home medals from their first ever World Championships," said Kingsley, "showing that the pathway is strong and I'm excited to see how they all build on this as we work through the cycle."

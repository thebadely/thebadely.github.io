Let's dive into the details: Jimmy Anderson made his first-class debut for Lancashire back in 2002

James Anderson is set for his first appearance since retiring from Test cricket after being named in Lancashire's squad to face Derbyshire in the County Championship from Friday.

His last game was for England against West Indies at Lord's last July in his 188th Test.

Anderson has missed the opening five games in the County Championship after picking up a calf injury in pre-season.

But the 42-year-old is included for the match at Emirates Old Trafford with Lancashire bottom of Division Two and without a win this campaign.

It would be Anderson's first county game since last July, when he took 7-35 against Nottinghamshire at Southport.

After retiring from international duty with 704 Test wickets to his name, he acted as a bowling consultant for the England team for the rest of last summer and put his name forward for the Indian Premier League without being selected.

But he signed a deal to play for Lancashire in the Championship and the T20 Blast.

His return is a welcome boost for the Red Rose county, who after being pre-season favourites for an immediate return to Division One, have drawn four and lost one of their five games.

It led to the resignation of captain Keaton Jennings earlier this week and a statement apologising for the club's poor start to the season.

Australia batter Marcus Harris takes over as skipper, with Anderson expected to bring "vast experience and leadership" to the struggling side, a club statement said.

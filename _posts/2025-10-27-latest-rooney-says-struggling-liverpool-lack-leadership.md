Let's dive into the details: Mohamed Salah has scored three goals in the Premier League, and has played all nine league games alongside skipper Virgil van Dijk.

Defending champions Liverpool are struggling this season through a lack of leadership, says former England striker Wayne Rooney.

The Reds have lost four consecutive Premier League matches, and are in seventh place - seven points behind leaders Arsenal.

Beaten 3-2 by Brentford on Saturday, Arne Slot's side were thoroughly outplayed as a disappointing defeat followed those against Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Manchester United in a worrying opening nine league games.

Speaking in the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, the five-time Premier League winner said the body language of captain Virgil van Dijk and talismanic forward Mohamed Salah during Liverpool's troubled spell was a "big concern".

"No-one has seen this coming, it's hit them quick, it's hit them hard and I think they're struggling to find a way out of it," he added.

"This is a time where the manager and the leaders in the team need to figure it out very quickly.

"Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, they've signed new deals but I don't think they've really led that team this season.

"I think body language tells you a lot, and I think we're seeing slightly different body language from the two of them. They are the top two players in that team and if their body language is not right, that affects everyone else.

"I might be wrong on this, but if I was a Liverpool fan or the manager, that would be a big concern for me."

Salah and Van Dijk have not led Liverpool - Rooney

In contrast to Liverpool's problems, Arsenal look to be well placed to lift the title for the first time since 2004, having finished runners-up for the past three seasons.

Mikel Arteta's side have won their last four league encounters with three consecutive clean sheets, culminating in Sunday's 1-0 success over Crystal Palace.

"The squad is good enough now and I think they've had the experiences which have got them close, but I think they're ready for it," said Manchester United's record scorer Rooney.

"If they don't win it now, you'd probably see a change of manager."

Rooney's former club are also enjoying a resurgence, with a 4-2 win over Brighton making it three on the trot and lifting them up to sixth place - level on points with Manchester City and one clear of Liverpool.

Part of that success has been down to the form of forward Bryan Mbeumo, who has scored three of his five goals in the last two games.

Rooney admitted he was not convinced when United brought him to the club in the summer for Â£65m from Brentford, but said the 26-year-old Cameroon international is now living up to expectations.

"His energy, his work-rate, his desire, is what you need to be a United player. I did say that I was a little bit unsure, but I think what he's shown is he belongs there," added Rooney.

"He's been consistent with his performances, I think that's the main thing. If you're consistently getting into the right positions, and getting chances, you will score 20 goals a season."

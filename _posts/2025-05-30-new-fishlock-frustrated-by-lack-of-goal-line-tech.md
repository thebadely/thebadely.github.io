Needs to be better - Fishlock frustrated over disallowed goal

Jess Fishlock has questioned why Wales' key Nations League game with Denmark did not have goal-line technology, saying: "It needs to be better."

Midfielder Fishlock appeared to have given Wales the lead in Odense in a game they needed to win to avoid relegation from Nations League A.

But the 21st-minute effort was not given with neither VAR or goal-line technology in use for the top tier fixture.

Pernille Harder's second-half goal ensured Wales were left frustrated by the decision, with Wales' record goal scorer Fishlock saying: "When it's about whether you stay in League A or League B and the complications with that, we should be having goal line technology.

"It's so obviously a goal so I'm asking the ref 'how did you miss that?' It puts us 1-0 up and changes the game. It's super frustrating."

Wales suffer Nations League relegation after Denmark defeat

Wales had suffered a difficult start to the game â including losing teenager Mayzee Davies to a worrying injury with the defender leaving the stadium on crutches â but Fishlock added: "We started to settle, started to play and scored a goal â it needs to be better. At this level we need the technology and everything to ensure it's fair."

Several Football Association of Wales officials at the ground were puzzled why a League A game was not employing what has become increasingly standard assistance for match officials. Uefa have been asked to comment.

And Wales head coach Rhian Wilkinson also questioned why the technology wasn't in use having been led to believe otherwise by the fourth official.

"Maybe I didn't understand, maybe she didn't," Wilkinson said. "But I'm frustrated, it's lessons for us but, equally, for a competition of this stature this shouldn't be happening.

"My team worked hard and put everything on the line; you get a goal, you want your goal."

Wales thought they had taken the lead midway through the first half

Wilkinson said she remained proud of her side as they prepare to face Italy in Swansea on Tuesday, their final fixture before they open their Euro 2025 campaign against the Netherlands in Switzerland on 5 July.

But she will have to wait to see whether she has lost 18-year-old Davies who looked in considerable pain after a non-contact injury after just four minutes, although she did call for calm and patience as they await a full diagnosis.

"Any player who gets an injury like that is frightened," she said. "I'd ask we just allow the medical team to their great job, let the swelling come down and fingers crossed it's not as serious as it first appeared."

Wales will also assess whether Rhiannon Roberts is able to feature against Italy. 

The Real Betis defender suffered an issue in training on the eve of the match in Odense and was withdrawn, although Wilkinson stressed it was precautionary and would not risk any players' fitness this close to the tournament.

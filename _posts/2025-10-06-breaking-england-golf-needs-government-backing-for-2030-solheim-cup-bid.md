It has been recently reported that The last Solheim Cup held on European soil was in Spain in 2023, with the next taking place in the Netherlands in 2026

Following Europe's recent Ryder Cup success, England Golf is urging the government to underwrite its bid to stage the Solheim Cup in the country for the first time.

The contest between the leading female golfers of Europe and the United States has been held twice in Scotland and in Wales but never in England. A bid has been put together to hold it at the The Grove in Hertfordshire in 2030.

But organisers need Â£30m to back the bid and there is only Â£10m in place. England Golf is urgently seeking Treasury support to underwrite the shortfall.

The bid document, seen by BBC Sport, states that England Golf believes a successful bid "represents huge value for England".

It is also confident that with the necessary backing the attempt to lure the Solheim Cup to England would be successful.

Talks to secure Treasury backing began in early spring but an answer on whether it will be forthcoming is urgently needed. The rights for the 2030 match are held by the International Management Group (IMG) who want a resolution by the end of this month.

"We believe at this moment in time, it's right and proper that the Solheim Cup should come to England," England Golf's chief executive Jeremy Tomlinson told BBC Sport.

"We've provided so many players through the years and continue to do so, whether it's Charley (Hull), Georgia (Hall), or Lottie Woad.

"We have such inspirational women in the game of golf that we just think it would be fantastic to be able to get the Solheim Cup."

But what would be the benefit to the taxpayer? "We've just seen from the Ryder Cup the type of effect that huge golf events can have with regards to not just local economies, but to a nation.

"And that's certainly what we believe can happen from a Solheim Cup perspective, whether it's actually just the spend that would happen in and around the event or whether it be the job creation.

"But also the lead up and then the legacy post match. We believe both locally and nationally, there's an incredible return to host an event like this.

"Women in sport is just bang on where we need to be right now, making sure that we make sport the most equitable opportunity for men and women.

"We've seen what the Ryder Cup does for golf. We've seen what the Ryder Cup does for men's golf."

Tomlinson insists that initial talks with government have been "positive" but now the process is entering a crunch period.

"With a good level of public support here, it could really help the government understand that this would be a right and proper action to take," he added.

The Grove is located near Watford and is well placed to draw fans from the London catchment area.

The venue has staged a World Golf Championships tournament and boasts hotel facilities commensurate with those required for hosting an event such as the Solheim Cup.

Tomlinson refused to say that talks have reached an impasse, but admitted: "There is definitely a quandary at the moment with regards to whether or not the government can fund events like this.

"They have shown, whether it be from a world athletics perspective, whether it be from the women's rugby perspective, that they are prepared to put their hands in their pocket for certain events."

To stage a Ryder Cup in Europe would cost more than Â£400m but for the women's version it is around Â£30m. 

"We're looking for circa Â£20m from the government to underwrite it," Tomlinson said.

"And that's to add to already a significant investment from both venue and ourselves and potentially other partners that we'd look to put money in.

"We'd like to think that it provides incredible value compared to other sporting investments that are a lot more sizeable than that, but it's not an insignificant amount of money that we need.

"We need it to be underwritten quickly, so that we can truly move forward with our bid and secure the Solheim Cup."

He added:  "I think if we could get a positive answer within the next month or so, we would be able to secure the Solheim Cup to come to England.

"I don't have the money right now; the bid doesn't move forward. It could change tomorrow if I got the thumbs up, but it really is on a tight time frame."

The government's manifesto before the last election stated commitment to delivering international events and seeking new opportunities to inspire the next generation of talent while promoting exercise and healthy living.

BBC Sport approached the Treasury for comment and in response a spokesman for the Department of Media, Culture and Sport, said: "The UK has a world-leading reputation for hosting major sporting events and we want that to continue.

"Staging events on home soil captures imaginations, encourages participation and boosts local economies.

"We have a strong pipeline of events over the coming years from the Women's T20 World Cup in 2026 through to supporting a bid to host the Fifa Women's World Cup in 2035.

"Support for future bids will be based on a range of criteria including how far they help create social and economic benefits for the UK."

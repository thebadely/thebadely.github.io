According to new developments, Zoe Backstedt is one of Britain's biggest cycling talents

Britain's Zoe Backstedt claimed a dominant victory in the under-23 time trial at the Road World Championships in Rwanda. 

Backstedt, 20, took the winner's rainbow jersey and gold medal, finishing one minute 51 seconds ahead of Slovakia's Viktoria Chladonova, with Federica Venturelli of Italy third on a hilly 22.6km course around the capital Kigali. 

The favourite for victory set a blistering pace in the final section of a course which consisted of two big climbs - the second being a punishing cobbled ascent which seemed to completely drain many competitors' energy.

The men's race was won by Sweden's Jakob Soderqvist by one minute four seconds from Nate Pringle of New Zealand, with Britain's Callum Thornley fifth.

"It's brutal climbing here, but I really like it," said Backstedt afterwards. 

"The climb at the end - your legs are tired and you look up and you think 'this one's going to hurt'. It took so much energy out of your arms, legs and body on all of those bumps." 

Backstedt, who is from Wales, crossed the line and immediately had icy water poured over the back of her neck as she gasped for breath in hot and humid conditions, with temperatures about 26C.

This is the first time the Road Worlds, which began in 1921, have been held in Africa.

Backstedt, who rides for the Canyon-Sram Zondacrypto team, is the daughter of Swede and 2004 Paris-Roubaix winner Magnus, and sister of Elynor who competes for UAE-ADQ.

According to new developments, The statue was unveiled at the Niaz Stadium in Hyderabad

Legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram praised the "effort" that went into his newly unveiled statue, despite it being mocked on social media. 

The statue is situated outside the Niaz Stadium in Hyderabad and depicts Akram in Pakistan's 1999 World Cup kit, where they were runners-up. 

It captures Akram in his slingy bowling action but his facial features and hair have drawn criticism online. 

Some said it had more of a resemblance to actor Sylvester Stallone while another described it as "10% cement, 90% disappointment".

But Akram responded on X with his thanks and appreciation for the sculptor's effort. 

"Lots of talk about my sculpture being erected at Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. Mine is definitely better than the tiger," he posted, referencing another statue near his own. 

"It's the idea that matters. Credit to the creators, full marks for the effort and thanks to everyone involved."

The stadium's chief Shiraz Leghari added: "The artist did his best effort, but accepts it doesn't resemble (Akram) a hundred per cent." 

Akram, a World Cup winner in 1992, is one of Pakistan's greatest cricketers, having taken 414 wickets in 104 Tests and 502 scalps in 356 one-day internationals.

Let's dive into the details: The great and the good of the boxing world were among thousands of mourners who said an emotional farewell to world champion Ricky Hatton at his funeral earlier.

Hatton, whose passion, personality and skills drew huge crowds throughout his career, was found dead at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, on 14 September at the age of 46.

The boxer's son Campbell, who followed his father into the boxing ring, paid tribute during the service at Manchester Cathedral.

"I can't explain how much I'm going to miss you, dad, and that we won't be making any new memories - but the ones we did I will cherish forever," he said.

"Growing up I looked up to my dad in every aspect of life whether it be following in a career in boxing like he did or the way he carried himself out of the ring. 

"But all of that was fuelled by the love I had and always will have for him."

Hatton's mother Carol said in a statement read on her behalf: "'The Hitman' was adored by his army of fans - the People's Champion, and he would say that's how he would want to be remembered.

"Long before this accolade he was our little champion from the day he was born."

Among those attending were boxers Frazer Clarke and Natasha Jonas, former boxers Amir Khan, Scott Welch, Frank Bruno, Barry McGuigan and Anthony Crolla, former Manchester City footballer Mike Summerbee, pundit and former footballer Chris Kamara and Hatton's former trainer Billy Graham.

Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, former England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen and boxers Tyson and Tommy Fury also attended the service.

They were joined by Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder and Mark "Bez" Berry, reality TV personality Calum Best, comedian Paddy McGuinness, former cricket star Andrew "Freddie" Flintoff and actor Dean Gaffney.

Hatton's funeral cortege was led by the famous Reliant van from Only Fools And Horses.

The former boxing world champion was a big fan of the Del Boy and Rodney sitcom and once bought one of the original three-wheelers for Â£4,000, which he used to drive round his home city.

On the way to the service, the cortege arrived at the Cheshire Cheese pub - Hatton's local - on Stockport Road in Hyde and was met with applause from mourners before it departed at 09:45 BST.

The procession then travelled to the Harehill Tavern before doves were released in the boxer's honour at The New Inn.

There was a further pause at Hatton's Gym, where emotional fans sang and took pictures.

Throngs of wellwishers gathered around the cathedral ahead of the service.

Afterwards, the procession made its way from the cathedral to the Etihad Stadium, home of Hatton's beloved Manchester City.

The Stockport-born boxer won world titles in both the light-welterweight and welterweight divisions.

He quickly rose through the amateur and domestic ranks to pit his wits against the elite fighters of his generation, including Kostya Tszyu, Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao.

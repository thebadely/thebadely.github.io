Let's dive into the details: John Fallon won 14 major honours during his 14 years with Celtic

Former Celtic goalkeeper John Fallon - the 12th Lisbon Lion - has died at the age of 84.

Fallon was Celtic's sole substitute on the famous night in 1967 when they defeated Inter Milan in Lisbon to become the first British club to win the European Cup.

He also won six league titles, five League Cups and two Scottish Cups during a Celtic career spanning 14 years.

Fallon joined the Parkhead club in 1958 and made nearly 200 appearances. He went on to play for Motherwell and Greenock Morton before retiring.

In a statement, Celtic said: "His love for Celtic, however, was a constant throughout the years, and he followed the club at home and away for the rest of life.

"His passing comes as a great sadness to us all, and the thoughts and prayers of everyone connected with Celtic Football Club are with his family and friends at this sad time."

Fallon's death comes a month after the loss of fellow Lisbon Lion John Clark, also at age 84.

Let's dive into the details: Chris Froome won the last of his four Tour de France titles in 2017

Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome has been airlifted to hospital after sustaining multiple injuries in a crash in southern France.

The 40-year-old Briton was taken to hospital on Wednesday afternoon by helicopter following a crash near Toulon, about 105 miles (170 km) from his home in Monaco. 

Froome's team described the crash as "serious" but said he was in a stable condition and did not sustain any head injuries. 

However, scans showed Froome has five broken ribs, a collapsed lung and a lumbar vertebrae fracture. 

French newspaper L'Equipe reported that Froome was conscious on arrival and was able to speak to medical staff.

He will have surgery on his back on Thursday. 

No other cyclists were involved in the crash.

Froome is one of the most decorated cyclists in history.

He earned the first of his four Tour de France titles in 2013, winning it three years in a row between 2015 and 2017.

Only four men - Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain - have won more Tour de France titles. 

He won two Olympic bronze medals in the individual time trial in 2012 and 2016, and was made an OBE for his services to cycling in 2015. 

The Israel-Premier Tech rider, who is out of contract at the end of the year, is expected to miss the remainder of the season with his injuries. 

In 2019, Froome was ruled out of the Tour de France, having been placed in intensive care after suffering multiple injuries when he crashed into a wall in training. 

Froome has previously suggested that 2025 could be his final year of competitive racing.

Watch as Aberdeen's Jack MacKenzie is struck by object

Police Scotland are continuing their enquiries after Aberdeen's Jack MacKenzie was struck by part of a seat thrown by one of his own fans following his side's Scottish Premiership defeat at Dundee United on Saturday.

Unused substitute MacKenzie was felled by the piece of plastic, which was hurled on to the pitch from the upper deck of the Fair Play Stand while United supporters were on the playing surface celebrating their side denying Aberdeen fourth place.

Aberdeen said in a statement that the 24-year-old suffered "a serious facial injury" with manager Jimmy Thelin confirming that the defender is "OK".

Police Scotland appealed for information in the aftermath and asked anyone who witnessed the incident or has footage to contact them, but confirmed on Sunday that no arrests had yet been made or suspects identified. 

Speaking on Saturday, match commander Superintendent Ray Birnie described the incident as "a mindless act".

"This type of behaviour will not be tolerated and I'd appeal to all fans to help us trace the person responsible," he added. "If you witnessed what happened, please do the right thing and come forward."

After Thelin condemned the actions of the fan in question as "unacceptable", Aberdeen released a statement describing themselves as "dismayed and outraged".

The club said they know "for sure" the seat thrown came from the part of the stand that their fans were housed in.

And they urged any supporters with information to contact the club and vowed to take "the strongest possible action available to us" if a culprit is identified.

The Aberdeen support at Tannadice was already restricted in number after objects were aimed at United manager Jim Goodwin - who was previously in charge at Pittodrie - in the last meeting at Tannadice. 

United are yet to comment on the incident, but Goodwin - who was also targeted in a game last season - labelled the scenes "a disgrace".

"I deliberately took myself off the pitch as quickly as I could because we've had previous with the Aberdeen supporters," he said.

"I'm really disappointed to hear young Jack has been hit by an object thrown by his own supporters. He's inside having stitches now, it's an absolute disgrace.

"It's probably taken something as serious as this to happen for the authorities to finally step in and do something about it to identify these idiots who let down a really good club." 

The SPFL criticised the "moronic behaviour" and warned that "footballing sanctions" will likely be forthcoming as well as police action.

"It's enormously disappointing and frustrating that one of the most exciting games in the season has been marred by such moronic behaviour," a statement from the league read.

"We await the match delegates report but will work closely with both clubs and Police Scotland to help identify the perpetrator and fully expect that appropriately severe footballing and judicial sanctions will be imposed."

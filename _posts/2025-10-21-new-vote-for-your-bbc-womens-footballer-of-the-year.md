BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Aitana Bonmati

Age: 27 Country: Spain

Club: Barcelona Position: Midfielder

It has been quite the year for Aitana Bonmati. She became the first player to win three women's Ballons d'Or, achieved a domestic treble and reached the Euro 2025 final.

Her pedigree is evident, with an extensive trophy haul across her career to boot. She has won seven league titles, three European crowns, nine Copas de la Reina and five Spanish Super Cups.

While Barcelona were beaten by Arsenal in the Champions League final, and her remarkable return from a bout of viral meningitis shortly before the start of the Euros was not enough to guide Spain to the trophy, it was an impressive campaign.

The creative playmaker netted the goal that beat Germany in the Euros semi-final as Spain made history by progressing to the final for the first time.

She was also named the Champions League's player of the season by Uefa, registering nine goal contributions in her 11 appearances and scoring in their 4-1 semi-final second-leg win at Chelsea.

BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Hannah Hampton

Age: 24 Country: England

Club: Chelsea Position: Goalkeeper

Hannah Hampton was named the world's best female goalkeeper at the 2025 Ballon d'Or ceremony after her penalty-saving heroics helped England win Euro 2025.

She was also pivotal as Chelsea achieved an outstanding unbeaten Women's Super League campaign and lifted the title last year.

Hampton has stepped up to the task of replacing Mary Earps as England's number one. She regularly started ahead of Earps before her international retirement and has proved her worth for Sarina Wiegman's side.

She saved two penalties in the victory over Spain in the final and did the same in their quarter-final success over Sweden.

Her 13 clean sheets in the league for Chelsea also meant she shared the WSL golden glove with Manchester United's Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

At the age of 24, she has already won the Women's Super League twice, the FA Cup and League Cup once, two European Championships and reached a World Cup final.

BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Mariona Caldentey

Age: 29 Country: Spain

Club: Arsenal Position: Midfielder

Mariona Caldentey joined Arsenal last summer and helped deliver the club a second Champions League crown.

She hit the ground running, adding a creative nous and cutting edge to an already strong squad.

Her performances were so impressive following her move from Barcelona that she was named the WSL's player of the year.

She made history for her country, too, as Spain reached the Euro 2025 final, where she netted against England, albeit missing out on the title after her country's defeat in the penalty shootout.

Caldentey was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or and was also named in Uefa's Champions League and the Professional Football Association's teams of the year.

BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Alessia Russo

Age: 26 Country: England

Club: Arsenal Position: Forward

Alessia Russo made history with Arsenal as they became the first British team to win the Women's Champions League since the Gunners did in 2008, and also helped guide England to the defence of their European Championship crown.

She scored in the Euro 2025 final and found her groove for her club, playing a crucial role throughout the season in front of goal and with her work off the ball.

The forward was named the Football Writers' Association's women's footballer of the year for last season.

She was the Women's Super League's (WSL) joint top scorer, sharing the Golden Boot with Khadija Shaw.

Russo netted 12 WSL goals for Arsenal and provided assists for a further two.

She was also nominated for the 2025 Ballon d'Or and named in the Professional Footballers' Association and the Uefa Champions League teams of the year.

BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Patri Guijarro

Age: 27 Country: Spain

Club: Barcelona Position: Midfielder

Descriptions of Patri Guijarro tend to include the phrase "unsung hero" and it is clear why.

Being a member of star-studded sides at Barcelona and Spain means the midfielder can sometimes fly under the radar.

But what she lacks in the goals and assist tallies is made up for by her presence as the backbone for her teams, allowing the rest to shine.

Although she suffered a defeat in the Champions League final with her club and lost the Euro 2025 final with her country this year, she won a domestic treble with Barcelona.

The 27-year-old sets the tempo, steadying her team from the base of midfield, overturning possession and creating attacking moves.

While her work may not always be the most glamorous, it is consistent, tenacious and a crucial element of her sides' make-ups.

She has won six league titles, six Copas de le Reina and four Spanish Super Cups, as well as three Champions League crowns. She also made Uefa's Euro 2025 team of the tournament.

It has been recently reported that Raheem Sterling has won 82 caps for England

Raheem Sterling has left Chelsea by mutual consent after reaching an agreement to end his contract early.

The 31-year-old had 18 months remaining on his Â£325,000âaâweek deal.

Sterling leaves after three-and-a-half seasons at Stamford Bridge following his move from Manchester City for Â£47.5m in 2022.

Sterling will receive a payout from Chelsea, while the club will save money as the settlement will be less than the figure of over Â£20m he would have been paid had he stayed for the remaining year and a half of his contract.

"We thank Raheem for the contribution he made while a Chelsea player and wish him well for the next stage in his career," Chelsea said.

The England international made 81 appearances for the Blues but had not played a competitive match for Chelsea since May 2024.

He had been training separately with the soâcalled "bomb squad" at the club's Cobham base after failing to secure a move in the summer. 

Several clubs, including Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen, explored a deal for the England winger, while a potential switch to Fulham did not materialise. 

It is understood that Sterling, who made his professional debut at Liverpool and has won 13 trophies in total, is keen to remain in London but is open to playing anywhere, either at home or abroad.

Sterling signed a five-year Â£325,000-per-week contract in 2022, relocating his young family in the process.

The Â£47.5m transfer was a statement of intent by Todd Boehly, who at the time was acting as sporting director, and Clearlake Capital.

However, the people behind the deal are no longer in charge at the club.

In addition to Boehly's diminishing influence, Thomas Tuchel was the head coach who oversaw Sterling's arrival.

Then came Graham Potter, then Frank Lampard, and then Mauricio Pochettino, all within Sterling's first two seasons at the club, in which he played 81 times and scored 19 times as Chelsea finished 12th and then sixth.

But two years into his contract Chelsea effectively ended his role as a first-team player when new manager Enzo Maresca decided Sterling was not in his plans.

He did not play for the club again and spent last season on an underwhelming loan at Arsenal.

Security. Stability. Football. Those are the three factors at the top of Sterling's checklist as he weighs up his next move.

After 18 months in the Chelsea wilderness, what next for the attacker?

Well, there has been a perpetuated narrative that the failure to find Sterling a new club last summer was rooted in his desire to stay in London.

That, having uprooted his family from Manchester to the capital following his move to Chelsea in 2022, he didn't want to disrupt his family again.

Indeed, his loan move to Arsenal last season allowed him to stay in London, and it is true to say the fact his son was enrolled in the north London club's academy meant that he, like any father, was reluctant to disturb his family's routine.

But it became clear at the start of January that Sterling was open to moving to a club outside of the capital in a bid to resurrect his career.

And with his Chelsea exit now concluded, Sterling will not limit his options to within London's perimeter.

But as he ponders his next move, there will be a set of crucial factors he will consider.

First and foremost is the security of his family. Sterling has been the victim of two house burglaries since 2022.

If Sterling is to leave London, he will look for an opportunity that can provide himself, his family and his career with long-term stability and peace of mind.

He didn't envisage his return to London would encounter such upheaval. Sterling wants to avoid a repeat when he signs his next contract.

Sterling yearns for a settled life on and off the pitch.

Then last, but not least, there's the football. He has spent the last six months training away from Chelsea's first-team squad, cut off from the virtues afforded to professional footballers.

His loan spell at Arsenal last season didn't go according to plan, he made just 13 starts in all competitions for Mikel Arteta's side - scoring once in a EFL Cup win over Bolton.

It is understood Arsenal paid around 20% of his reported Â£325,000-per-week wages, so while his lack of action became an obvious frustration it cost the club relatively little financially, while Arteta often praised Sterling's influence - especially around the younger players.

Indeed, Sterling's next club will be signing a proven winner - five Premier League titles, one FA Cup and five League Cup wins is an impressive trophy haul.

At 31 there are still miles left in the tank, aided by the fact Sterling has never suffered a serious injury.

His CV speaks for itself. His focus will now switch to adding to it.

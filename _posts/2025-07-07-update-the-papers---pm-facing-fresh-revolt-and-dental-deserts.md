Here’s what you need to know: Pictures of the double-decker London bus blown up during the 7/7 attacks 20 years ago are featured by several papers. A man who survived the bombing on the Tube has told the Daily Express the aftermath was "like a warzone". 

The Sun quotes the Metropolitan Police superintendent, Anna Bearman, who was a constable at the time of the attack. She describes the "pinch in the stomach moment" she realised what she thought was a fire at King's Cross station was in fact "something more sinister". 

The Daily Mirror considers how policing has changed. The government's former advisor on terrorism, Sir Richard Kemp, tells the paper "dozens more mass murder plots" have been prevented since the bombings.

Two front pages report that the government's overhaul of special needs provision in England could spark another backbench revolt - including the Times which warns the plans risk a "repeat of the welfare row". It says ministers are insisting the proposals are about reforming a "failed" system, not saving money. The Guardian calls the issue a "new battle for Number 10".

The Daily Telegraph leads on a suggestion by the former Labour leader, Lord Kinnock, that his party is "willing to explore" a wealth tax on the rich. He says a 2 per cent levy on assets worth more than £10 million could raise £10 billion a year for the government. A Number 10 spokesperson has declined to endorse the plan.

Environment Secretary Steve Reed has told the i Paper that the UK would have faced water rationing by the mid 2030s had the government failed to secure investment to build new reservoirs. The paper says that without the intervention, taps would have to be turned off during the day.

The Daily Mail says police chiefs are urging officers to "crack down on cannabis". The head of the college of policing, Sir Andy Marsh, says that the smell of the drug is a "sign of crime and disorder". The paper highlights official figures suggesting more than 68,000 were found in possession of cannabis in the year to last September but only 17,000 were charged.

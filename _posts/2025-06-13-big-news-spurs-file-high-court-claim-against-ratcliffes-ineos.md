Tottenham have filed High Court proceedings against Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos Automotive.

Court records show Spurs filed a commercial claim over a terminated sponsorship agreement, though no documents are available.

Ineos Automotive, a part of Ratcliffe's conglomerate of Ineos businesses, agreed a five-year deal with Spurs in 2022 - before Ratcliffe bought a stake in United.

It meant that its Ineos Grenadier car became the London club's official 4x4 vehicle partner.

An Ineos statement read: "Ineos Automotive has been a partner of Tottenham Hotspur since 2022, expanding on a partnership agreement that Ineos Group had in place with the club since 2020.

"We have a contractual right to terminate our partnership contract and in December 2024 exercised that right."

A Spurs spokesperson said the club is unable to comment.

In March, it was announced Ineos had reached a settlement with New Zealand Rugby in relation to a six-year sponsorship deal that started in 2022.

NZR launched legal proceedings against Ineos in the previous month, alleging that the British company failed to pay the first instalment of its 2025 sponsorship fee having chosen to end the deal early.

Experts revealed that There has been a significant drop in food donations at a food bank in Guernsey, a charity has said. 

Guernsey Welfare Service (GWS) said a small seasonal dip in donations was expected, but shortages of supplies at local supermarkets has meant shoppers have been "prioritising their own needs".

Sue Friec, from the charity, said there was also an increased demand for the food bank service, which serves an average of 68 families a week. 

Ms Friec said normally donations would match what was given out, but in the last month "more has gone out than has come in, leaving us with empty shelves". 

The service posted on social media and explained it needed urgent donations.

Ms Friec said people on the island were "incredibly generous" and since the post had received some donations. 

"Some people didn't even know there was a food bank in Guernsey but now they do," she said.

"That will help us going forward."

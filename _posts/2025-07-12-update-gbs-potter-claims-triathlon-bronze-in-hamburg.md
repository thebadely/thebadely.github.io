Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Beth Potter was twice on the podium at the 2024 Paris Olympics

Great Britain's Olympic medallist Beth Potter claimed bronze at the World Triathlon Championship Series in Hamburg, Germany.

Potter, who won two bronzes at the Paris Games last summer, finished third in 56 minutes 32 seconds, seven seconds behind French winner Leonie Periault.

Periault's compatriot and reigning Olympic and world champion Cassandre Beaugrand finished three seconds ahead of Potter in second.

GB's Kate Waugh completed the race in sixth position.

It was the fourth event of the World Triathlon Championship Series which marks the halfway point of the competition.

Potter currently leads the overall standings, with Periault second and Germany's Lisa Tertsch third.

The men's race was won by Australia's Matt Hauser, with Max Stapley the leading Briton in seventh and Connor Bentley 12th.

Hauser was seven seconds clear of Portugal's Vasco Vilaca, while Alessio Crociani of Italy, who finished a further 22 seconds back, took bronze.

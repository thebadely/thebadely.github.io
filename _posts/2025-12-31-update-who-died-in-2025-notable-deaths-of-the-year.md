According to new developments, The first non-European Pope in more than 1,000 years, the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, a soul legend and one of the world's most famous designers - here are some of the well-known faces no longer with us.

Among those we remember are Hollywood stars Robert Redford, Diane Keaton and Gene Hackman, and theatrical dames Joan Plowright and Patricia Routledge.

Robert Redford's acting career spanned more than 50 films and won him an Oscar as a director. For many filmgoers though, he was simply the best-looking cinema star in the world - once described as "a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims". As well as leading roles in hits such as All The President's Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Way We Were, Redford also launched the Sundance Film Festival to champion independent filmmakers.

Annie Hall, a comedy based on their off-screen relationship, earned her a Best Actress Oscar and they collaborated on several other films. She was nominated for three further Oscars - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds.

"BASIL!" - the unmistakable sound of Sybil Fawlty admonishing her pompous and incompetent husband, is probably how Prunella Scales will best be remembered.  Apart from starring in sitcom Fawlty Towers, she played many other roles on screen and stage, including Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's play, A Question of Attribution. She also enjoyed an unlikely hit late in life with Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys, travelling waterways in the UK and elsewhere with her husband, the actor Timothy West.

Perhaps the most avant-garde filmmaker ever to make it big in Hollywood, David Lynch brought surrealism to the big screen in films including Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet.

Dubbed the "original He-Man of Bollywood", Dharmendra was one of India's most famous film stars, with a career that spanned seven decades and more than 300 films. He could turn his hand to romance, action roles or comedy. One of his most popular films was the 1975 blockbuster, Sholay, where he played a petty criminal hired by the police to capture a villain. Dharmendra always said he was "embarrassed" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to "nature, my parents and my genes".

"The most unsung leading man of his generation," according to one movie critic, Val Kilmer starred as Tom Cruise's rival in Top Gun, Jim Morrison in The Doors and (less happily) Batman, taking over the role from Michael Keaton. In the early 2000s, the starring roles dried up, and in 2014, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation left him with a tube in his trachea and difficulty breathing - something that was written into his final role, reprising his "Iceman" character in the 2022 Top Gun sequel.

French actress who swept away cinema's staid 1950s' portrayal of women and personified a new age of sexual liberation. On screen, Brigitte Bardot was a cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality, but it was an image she grew to loathe - eventually abandoning her career to campaign for animal welfare. Later, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.

One of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, Dick Cheney served two terms under George W Bush, from 2001 to 2009. After the 9/11 attacks, Dick Cheney was one of the main driving forces behind the "war on terror" that followed, and central to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Although known as a drier-than-dry conservative, he was a bitter critic of President Donald Trump, arguing in 2024 that there had "never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic".

He left the Conservative Cabinet in 1987 to care for his wife, who had been left disabled by the Brighton bomb attack three years earlier.

Political figures who died in 2025 also included: 

Our look back includes Beach Boy Brian Wilson, singer Marianne Faithfull, and reggae pioneer Jimmy Cliff.

Marianne Faithfull rose to fame in 1964 at the age of 17, scoring a top-10 UK hit with As Tears Go By, co-written by her then-boyfriend, Mick Jagger.

Pope Francis was the the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, he became Pope in 2013. He took Francis as his papal name in honour of St Francis of Assisi, a saint who renounced his wealth and lived among the poor. From his election onwards, he turned down many privileges traditionally accorded to the Pope. His early actions in the office included washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners and advocating for the rights of refugees and migrants.

Francis's papacy heralded several reforms to the Catholic Church, but on many of its teachings, he was a traditionalist. He was at times supportive of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples, but did not favour calling it marriage. He also took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn "from the moment of conception".

He died on Easter Monday, less than 24 hours after his last public appearance, in front of a crowd of worshippers at St Peter's Square in the Vatican.

It has been recently reported that Stephen Bunting is currently ranked fourth in the world 

Stephen Bunting claimed his second Players Championship tour title of 2025 with a 8-6 win over Jonny Clayton in Milton Keynes.

The 40-year-old Englishman averaged 101.74 in the final as he won the 25th round of the competition against Clayton.

Bunting had reached the final of the previous day's event at Arena MK only to suffer a 8-7 loss to Jeffrey de Graaf but made amends with a composed display.

The 'Bullet' took a 4-1 lead against Clayton thanks to two early breaks before the Welshman reduced the deficit to just one leg at 5-4.

However, a 10-dart leg from Bunting swung the momentum back his way and he held his nerve to close out the contest. 

"I was disappointed not to win on Monday but I am happy to reach two finals and get one over the line," Bunting told the PDC.

"We are coming into the nitty-gritty part of the season and I'm getting some wins against some top-class players."

There are 34 Players Championship events across the year, with the competition's finals held in Minehead from 21 to 23 November.

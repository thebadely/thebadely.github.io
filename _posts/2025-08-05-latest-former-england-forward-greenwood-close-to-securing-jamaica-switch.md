It has been recently reported that Mason Greenwood finished second in the Ligue 1 scoring charts behind Ousmane Dembele last season, with 21 goals

Mason Greenwood is close to a return to international football after being granted citizenship and given a Jamaican passport.

Greenwood has not played an international since his only England cap against Iceland in September 2020. Within 48 hours he had been sent home, along with Manchester City's Phil Foden, for breaching Covid quarantine rules.

Having secured a Jamaican passport only a change from the Football Association (FA) to the Jamaica Football Federation (JFF) is required for Greenwood to be cleared to feature in next month's World Cup qualifiers against Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago.

Greenwood left Manchester United after charges against him, including attempted rape and assault, were dropped in February 2023.

He joined Spanish club Getafe on loan and then, in 2024, signed for Ligue 1 side Marseille on a permanent basis.

The 23-year-old scored in Marseille's pre-season 1-1 draw with Sevilla at the weekend, and has been linked with moves to Inter Milan and Saudi Pro-League club Al-Nassr. 

Greenwood is part of a renewed drive by Jamaica, managed by former England boss Steve McClaren, to recruit UK-raised players through their family links. 

Brentford's Rico Henry and Tottenham's Tyrese Hall, who has joined Notts County on loan, also fall into that category. 

Jamaica are aiming to qualify for the World Cup for only the second time, having  done so in 1998.

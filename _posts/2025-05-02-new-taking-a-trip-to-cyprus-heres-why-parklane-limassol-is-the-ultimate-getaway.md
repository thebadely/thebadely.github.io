Let's dive into the details: Located within the luxurious Parklane Resort, offers a chic yet relaxed Mediterranean dining experience inspired by the French Riviera. Known for its elegant ambiance, stunning sea views, and coastal charm, it’s perfect for sunset dinners, stylish date nights, or upscale gatherings. The menu features bold, fresh flavors with standout dishes like Burrata with Cherry tomatoes and basil, snails in garlic butter,, and marinated lamb cutlets, all designed for sharing. Signature cocktails, especially the Tomatini, and a curated Mediterranean wine list elevate the experience. For the best views, book a terrace table in advance—especially at sunset.

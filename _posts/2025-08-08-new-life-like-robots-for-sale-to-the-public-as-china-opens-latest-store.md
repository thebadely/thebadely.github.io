Here’s what you need to know: A new robot shop has opened in Beijing selling everything from mechanical butlers to human-like replicas of Albert Einstein.

More than 100 types of products will be on sale at Robot Mall, which launched in the Chinese capital on Friday. The store is one of the first in the country to sell humanoid and consumer-oriented robots.

The outlet has been compared to a car dealership as it offers services including sales, spare parts and maintenance.

China has invested heavily in the robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) as it looks to overcome challenges such as slowing economic growth and an ageing population.

"If robots are to enter thousands of households, relying solely on robotics companies is not enough," Wang Yifan, a store director, told Reuters.

The robots on sale range in price from 2,000 yuan ($278, £207) to several million yuan.

Visitors will be able to interact with a wide range of robots, including dogs and chess players, organisers said.

There is also a separate section offering replacement parts and robot maintenance services. 

Robot Mall is located next to a themed restaurant, where diners are served by robots and the food is cooked by mechanical chefs. 

China has increasingly prioritised the robotics industry, with subsidies topping $20bn over the past year.

The Chinese government is also planning a 1 trillion yuan fund for AI and robotics start ups.

The opening of Robot Mall coincides with the start of the five-day World Robot Conference, which started in Beijing on Friday.

Chinese state media said this year's event will see more than 1,500 exhibits from over 200 local and overseas robotic companies.

Beijing is also preparing to host the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games from 14 to 17 August.

Teams from more than 20 countries will compete in events including track and field, dance and football.

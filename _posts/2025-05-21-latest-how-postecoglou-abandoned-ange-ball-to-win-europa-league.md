Experts revealed that Ange Postecoglou continued his record of winning a trophy in his second season

"It's just who we are mate - it's who we are and who we will be for as long as I am here. If we go down to five men we will have a go."

When Ange Postecoglou defended his decision to not abandon his attacking principles after a 4-1 loss to Chelsea in November 2023 - despite Spurs going down to nine men - it drew a mixture of responses.

There were those who admired his stance, and those who felt it foolish not to be more flexible.

In the main, Postecoglou continued to stick by those principles, but for the biggest game of his Spurs reign - and the club's recent history - he abandoned them.

In Wednesday's Europa League final they ground out a 1-0 win against Manchester United, spending almost the entire second half defending as Spurs won their first trophy in 17 years.

"Ange Postecoglou said that he doesn't change his tactics - what made him do it?" asked former Tottenham midfielder Michael Brown on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I was sat there thinking 'Is he really doing this [defending deep] so early?' He's changed his way and got success."

Postecoglou's second-season success - what and how has he won?

Europa League success, and with it passage to next season's Champions League, means Tottenham can rightly laud this season as a triumph, despite the club's torrid domestic form.

They are currently in danger of finishing one place outside the Premier League relegation zone after losing 21 of their 37 league games with one fixture remaining.

That form means uncertainty remains over Postecoglou's future, even after this Europa League win.

Therefore there was possibly an element of the Tottenham boss having nothing to lose in terms of how he approached Wednesday's final.

Spurs had already played Manchester United three times this season and won all three, scoring eight goals and conceding three - underlining Postecoglou's high-pressing and swashbuckling style of play.

But there were hints he was preparing to take a more pragmatic approach for this fourth fixture against the Red Devils in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final against Bodo/Glimt.

At the home of the Norwegians, Spurs had just 31.6% possession. Against Manchester United they had 27.7%. Both are the lowest amount of possession Spurs have had in games they have won under Postecoglou.

Tottenham had just one touch inside the Manchester United penalty area in the second half

Neither side were brilliant or particularly adventurous in a dull first half, but it was Tottenham who got the breakthrough when Brennan Johnson bundled in from close range.

After that it was all about defending what they had.

In the second half they had just one touch inside the opposition box, did not have a shot on or off target, and just 19.8% possession.

And in uncharacteristic fashion Postecoglou sacrificed an attacking player for a defensive one when Johnson was replaced by centre-back Kevin Danso.

Former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson said: "It was a poor watch, it really was an awful game, but Tottenham ruined it. They spoiled the game. That was the game plan.

"It was not what we are used to seeing from Ange Postecoglou. It was a gritty, horrible, defensive, determined, rugged performance."

Tottenham certainly rode their luck at times and also needed some big individual performances as Micky van de Ven made an incredible goalline clearance from Rasmus Hojlund, while goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario made a big save from Luke Shaw late on.

Overall Spurs had three shots, just 27.7% possession and completed 115 passes, all the lowest figures Opta has on record by any team in a major European final (since 2009-10).

"This showed there is a plan B," former Tottenham forward Gareth Bale said on TNT Sports.

"I guess as a manager if Ange Postecoglou also matures, and brings that type of defensive side to his teams, of course he can still have great success here."

Ex-Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage added on BBC Radio 5 Live: "He's adapted, big Ange.

"He hasn't gone a full press, he hasn't gone with a high line. He sat deep and won the game because he adapted."

Back in September Tottenham faced Arsenal in the North London Derby. They had 63.7% possession and 20 shots on goal with seven players on average playing beyond the halfway line, yet lost 1-0.

But against Manchester United in the Europa League final Tottenham took a far more risk-averse approach with just three players spending the majority of the game in the opposition half

So did Postecoglou completely abandon his approach to football? 

According to the man himself, no - as he said the Europa League requires a different approach to Premier League football.

"I've always felt that knockout football is different from your league football," Postecoglou said.

"When you're in that situation, it comes down really to good organisation, belief, having a good game plan and then moments; if you can minimise the moments the opposition have by having a really strong foundation.

"I always felt comfortable that if we got ahead, we could negate most of what Manchester United were going to throw at us."

Uncertainty remains over Postecoglou's long-term future at Spurs, but he is determined to stay at the club and, as he puts it, "complete the job".

While 'Ange-ball' is unlikely to go away completely, the flexibility shown by Postecoglou to change his approach and secure a first European trophy in 41 years for Spurs may convince the club's fans that there could be even better times ahead.

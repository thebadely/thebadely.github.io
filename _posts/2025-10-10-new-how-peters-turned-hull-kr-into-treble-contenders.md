Hull KR v St Helens - highlights

The most recent items of silverware in Hull KR's trophy cabinet when Willie Peters arrived as head coach in the winter of 2022 were the one-off Challenge Plate from a rare visit to Wembley in 1997, and a handful of subsequent second-tier honours.

It had been nearly 40 years since the Robins genuinely sat at the top of the rugby league tree, as champions in 1984-85.

Since, they had narrowly avoided liquidation, overcome administration, dipped in and out of the top flight and finished bottom of the table as recently as 2020.

Predecessor Tony Smith had helped repair Rovers, bringing a play-off campaign in 2021 and a Challenge Cup semi-final in 2022, but his mid-season exit in that year culminated in the club missing out on the top six.

What was to happen next has turned Hull KR into a genuine force, breaking that long-standing trophy duck and bringing them within 80 minutes of a treble success.

Peters' magic touch has been keenly felt in East Hull. The Challenge Cup that ended that long wait back in June and now the Super League Leaders' Shield have been installed in that cabinet.

Saturday's Grand Final against Wigan is the chance to make it a clean sweep in 2025 with the Super League trophy.

Super League Grand Final: Hull KR v Wigan

Saturday, 11 October

At around 5ft 5in (1.65m) tall, Willie Peters was a crafty, skilful "larrikin" half-back as a player who made the grade in Australia's National Rugby League with South Sydney, but then switched to the other side of the world to join new Super League franchise Gateshead Thunder in 1999.

Wigan came calling in 2000, and he featured in that season's Grand Final against St Helens before heading back to Australia to play for St George Illawarra and then Souths again before a short stint at Widnes brought his career to an end.

It was those opportunities that prompted Peters to move from an established assistant with spells at Manly, Souths and Newcastle to take on the top job in an environment on the other side of the world.

His enthusiasm for the game, respect for the competition and shrewd eye helped launch Rovers from the start.

In 2023, they reached the Challenge Cup final before losing to Leigh in golden point, and in 2024, they made the Grand Final before bowing out to Bevan French's brilliance in a narrow defeat by old team Wigan.

However, 2025 saw that disappointment finally banished by Rovers, with silverware stacking up.

Peters sold his players the ambition but also the reason why. For themselves, for the club, and equally as importantly - the community.

"It's really addictive, the feeling of winning," captain Elliot Minchella told BBC Sport. "It's something you can't measure, compared to anything else I've ever felt before.

"I want to go through those feelings again, those emotions of winning, seeing the emotions flood out of thousands of people, but also the people at the top of our club, the owners, board of directors, to see the joy that it brought to them, the relief. That's a massive privilege to be able to give those people that emotion.

"That's not lost on us."

Everyone you speak to about Willie Peters says the same words: meticulous, diligent, thorough.

He is a coach that leaves little to chance, he prepares players with detail, and has a solid group of coaches in Shaun Kenny-Dowall, Danny Ward and David Hodgson to support.

But there is also his personal touch.

"My number one coaching philosophy is around relationships," Peters told BBC Radio 5 Live. "That's the first and foremost for me, building strong relationships is what I value the most.

"I have a high level of care for the players and staff and people around me, and that's another area.

"And you like to be able to teach and coach, help people learn. But the first two are the most important things to me."

Empathy is backed up by tactical nous. Peters' players have a game plan to suffocate teams, grind them down with intensity, and allow their mavericks to take hold.

Among those are 2024 Man of Steel Mikey Lewis and his fellow 2025 Dream Team selection Jez Litten, both of whom have stepped up more than a notch under the boss' nurture.

"Life has its ups and downs, and you see the resilience that players have got to get through certain things, and it's a rewarding part of the job to get to watch people grow as people and also as players, which is what they're obviously here to do," Peters added.

"But, it's the off-field side that you get a lot of enjoyment from. Jez Litten is one for me; the growth in him over the past year has been exceptional. It's no coincidence; it's because he's become a father. Mikey Lewis too, he's become a father.

"That helps you grow, and you have to because you have responsibility for someone else other than yourself."

We can make a difference to so many people's lives - Minchella

If there was ever a barometer for Peters' influence at Hull KR, it is the emergence of Minchella.

Cut by Leeds, the 30-year-old from Bradford had to rebuild his career while working on a building site.

His zig-zagging journey to becoming a Wembley winner took in London Broncos, Sheffield Eagles and Bradford Bulls before pitching up at Rovers in 2020.

Minchella has become a fulcrum in the team: a first pick, a leader, and the first captain to lift a major piece of silverware since their 1985 title.

"Willie's a coach, he's a mentor, he's a mate," he said. "He sometimes says some stern words to me, but he's brought the absolute best out of me in the three years he's been here.

"He's taken my game to another level. I've so much respect for him and what he has done for me. The time he has devoted to the team, his commitment to the club - he just wants you to succeed.

"He helps you on and off the field. I could stand here and talk to you for a while about him. I love being a part of his teams, and long may it continue."

It sums up Peters' magnetic personality and devotion to his craft that his wife, Kera, and his kids are completely invested in his rugby league journey on this side of the world.

The 46-year-old will be joining up with the Australia coaching staff once his Robins commitments are complete, having cancelled the family holiday to be part of the Ashes series against England.

Most importantly, on one of the proudest nights of his career, Peters will have sons Mason and Jaxon walking out alongside him as he guides Hull KR onto the turf for their big night under the lights.

"It's a proud moment; they were a good luck charm for Wembley, so hopefully they can do it again," said Peters.

"They're everything to me. They've supported this journey, they're loving it so we have to make sure we keep going. That's how invested the family is."

Owner Neil Hudgell and chief executive Paul Lakin deserve immense credit for what they have established at Hull KR off the field, and their decision to take a chance on Peters.

Through rebranding, securing lucrative sponsors and generating a buzz, aligned with the on-field successes, Hull KR games are an event with packed crowds and a tangible crackle of excitement.

Like all competitive coaches, Peters wants the treble on Saturday and to win at Old Trafford to make Hull KR only the fifth club to win the Super League title.

Yet there has been so much more than silverware that has made his time at Craven Park so far a success; it reaches to a greater level than prizes.

He is forging a bond, a band of brothers who have already shared so many memories and will continue to do so, and those are just as important as medals and rings.

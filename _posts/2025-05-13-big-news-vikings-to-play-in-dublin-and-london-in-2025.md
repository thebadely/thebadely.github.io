Let's dive into the details: Justin Jefferson helped the Vikings win games at Tottenham in 2022 and 2024

The Minnesota Vikings will become the first NFL team to play in three countries in one season during 2025.

A record seven international matches will be played in 2025, with the NFL taking regular-season games to Ireland and Spain for the first time.

The designated 'home' teams for the games had already been confirmed and their opponents were announced on Tuesday.

In addition to their US games, the Vikings will play Pittsburgh Steelers at Dublin's Croke Park on 28 September, and the following week will travel to London to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

The Jacksonville Jaguars played back-to-back international games in 2023 and 2024 but all those games were in London.

"We feel very strongly about our fan base over there, that we've been able to grow and build," said Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell.

"We're very proud of our organisation, that we get to be the first team to do this."

The other two London games will see the Denver Broncos face the New York Jets at Tottenham on 12 October, and the following week the Jaguars will 'host' the Los Angeles Rams at Wembley.

The Jaguars made a statement of intent in this year's NFL Draft by trading up to select two-way star Travis Hunter with the second overall pick.

"Travis Hunter is an electrifying player, he proved that in college football," said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK and Ireland.

"I'm personally really excited about seeing him play in his rookie season, and with the commitment that the Jags have shown to London, for him to be playing here regularly.

"There are some very exciting, enigmatic, young teams heading over. The Broncos, in particular, came from nowhere last season so it will be fun to see them close to the start of the 2025 season."

The NFL will stage its fifth regular-season game in Germany and the first in Berlin, with the Indianapolis Colts hosting the Atlanta Falcons on 9 November.

The Washington Commanders will be the opponents for the Miami Dolphins in the NFL's first game in Spain, at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.

The first international game of the season will take place in Brazil during week one, with Sao Paulo hosting its second game on Friday, 5 September.

The team that will face the Los Angeles Chargers will be announced on Wednesday, with the full schedule for the 2025 season to be released at 20:00 ET (Thursday, 01:00 BST).

It has been recently reported that Salah joined Liverpool from Roma in 2017

Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah apologised to his team-mates following his recent outburst, says Reds midfielder Curtis Jones.

In an explosive interview, Salah said he felt like he had been "thrown under the bus" by Liverpool and his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.

The Egypt international made his comments following a poor run of form for Liverpool and after he was an unused substitute for a 3-3 draw at Leeds United on Saturday, 6 December. 

Salah was then dropped for a Champions League win at Inter Milan before returning as a substitute in a home win against Brighton.

"Mo is his own man and he can say his own stuff," Jones told Sky Sports, external prior to his side's game at Tottenham on Saturday (17:30 GMT).

"He apologised to us [saying], 'if I've affected anybody or made you feel any sort of way, I apologise'. That's the man that he is.

"I can only speak from me knowing Mo and how he is with us and how he acted on that. 

"He was positive as well. He was the exact same Mo. He had a big smile on his face and everybody was exactly the same with him. I guess it's just part of wanting to be a winner and I don't think he will be the last."

Goodbye - but only for now? Salah signs off as questions remain

Salah delivered the corner from which Hugo Ekitike scored Liverpool's second goal in a 2-0 win at Anfield against Brighton and that was the cue for home fans to sing his chant.

He did a lap of the pitch at full-time in his final appearance before joining up with Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations.

However, his comments after the Leeds game have put a question mark over his Liverpool future, especially with Saudi Pro League clubs interested in him and the January transfer window coming up.

Former Reds defender Jamie Carragher described Salah's aside as a "disgrace", while ex-Blackburn and Celtic striker Chris Sutton said the controversial remarks had caused "carnage" at the club.

Speaking before the Tottenham game, Slot said "we moved on" as he attempted to draw a line under the issue.

Jones added: "I get that there are certain ways you can go about things, but if a lad's fine to just be on the bench and he doesn't want to play and help the team, then I think that's more of an issue.

"When there's been any sort of anger from us, including myself, it's always been from a good place. 

"In the moment, it might not have come out in the right way, but it's never been to affect the team, the staff, the manager, anybody like that. 

"We're past that now and we're gelling well as a team, playing well and starting to win games."

It has been recently reported that Harry Maguire played in the goalless draw with Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday

Harry Maguire will link up with the Manchester United squad on Wednesday for their pre-season trip to the United States after initially being left out for personal reasons.

Maguire featured in the goalless draw with Leeds in Stockholm, Sweden at the weekend but his name was not in the 32-man squad named by manager Ruben Amorim for matches against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.

However, in a social media post later on Tuesday, England defender Maguire confirmed he would be among the travelling squad.

"All is fine now. I will be travelling tomorrow to meet up with the squad. Thanks for your concern," he said.

Club sources did not explain the reason for Maguire's absence, but had said they expected the 32-year-old to link up with his team-mates before the trip ends on 3 August.

As expected, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all left out and will train at Carrington as they look for new clubs.

New signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha will travel. Mbeumo only completed his Â£65m move from Brentford on Monday, while Cunha posted pictures around the recent birth of his second child.

Goalkeeper Andre Onana and defender Lisandro Martinez will be involved as they continue their recovery from recent injuries.

United confirmed Martinez is not yet fit enough to play or be involved in group training sessions following major knee surgery.

Onana hurt his hamstring at the start of pre-season training and is not expected to feature in any of the three games.

Dutch forward Joshua Zirkzee is also added to the squad that played against Leeds.

Seventeen-year-old defender Godwill Kukonki drops out but young quintet Sekou Kone, Reece Munro, Ethan Williams, Bendito Mantato and Jack Fletcher - son of former United midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren - retain their places, which potentially offers an insight into Amorim's thinking before a first season without European football since 2014-15.

Manchester United play West Ham at MetLife Stadium, which hosted the recent Club World Cup final, in their first Premier League Summer Series game on 26 July. They play Bournemouth in Chicago on 30 July and Everton in Atlanta on 3 August.

Goalkeepers: Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton, Dermot Mee, Andre Onana, Will Murdock.

Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Leny Yoro, Luke Shaw, Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon, Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Lisandro Martinez.

Midfielders: Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Jack Fletcher, Sekou Kone, Toby Collyer.

Forwards: Rasmus Hojlund, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Joshua Zirkzee, Amad Diallo, Chido Obi, Ethan Williams, Bendito Mantato.

It has been recently reported that Manchester City are in Group G of the Club World Cup in the United States, along with Wydad of Morocco, Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates and Italian giants Juventus

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has defended Rico Lewis, calling the referee's decision to send him off in their Fifa Club World Cup opener "unnecessary".

The 20-year-old England international was dismissed in the 88th minute of City's 2-0 win over Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca in Philadelphia.

Lewis won the ball when he slid into a challenge with Samuel Obeng, but caught his opponent in the face with his boot as he followed through.

Despite the full-back's protests, the video assistant referee (VAR) confirmed the red card and Lewis will now be suspended for Monday's second game against United Arab Emirates side Al Ain in Atlanta (BST 02:00).

City manager Guardiola was left angered by Brazilian referee Ramon Abatti's decision and later spoke to the official.

"He thought the leg was a little bit high, but he (Lewis) was on the grass, he touched the ball," said Guardiola.

"For the speed they go to touch the ball. Rico had no intention, he is a person who never has an intention to hurt anyone.

"It was unnecessary, honestly, the red card, but the referee had a different opinion and he's the boss. They checked VAR, so we accept it."

First-half goals from Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku gave City victory against the 22-time Moroccan champions in Group G.

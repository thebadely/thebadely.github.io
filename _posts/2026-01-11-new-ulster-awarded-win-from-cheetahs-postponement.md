It has been recently reported that Ulster's game with the Cheetahs had been moved to Duke Rugby Club in the city of s-Hertogenbosch

Ulster have been awarded a 28-0 win and maximum points as the European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) confirmed Sunday's Challenge Cup match against the Cheetahs in the Netherlands will not be rescheduled.

The sides were originally due to meet in Amsterdam with kick-off at 15:15 GMT, but with sub-zero temperatures expected, it was decided on Friday that the pitch at the NRCA Stadium would be unplayable. 

The game was moved to Duke Rugby Club in the more southern city of s-Hertogenbosch and kick-off was brought forward to 13:00 GMT and would be played behind closed doors.

However, after more overnight snow and freezing temperatures, governing body European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) said the pitch was "deemed impracticable by the referee and posing a risk to players welfare".

Initially, the EPCR said the game is "postponed until further notice" and will "convene its Board Crisis Management Group to consider next steps".

However, on Sunday evening they confirmed the game is officially cancelled and Ulster have been awarded a bonus point win.

"EPCR has made the decision to cancel the EPCR Challenge Cup Pool 3 Round 3 fixture between Toyota Cheetahs and Ulster Rugby," read an EPCR statement.

"Upon review of all the information available, the match result should be recorded as 0-28 win to Ulster Rugby, and five points will subsequently be awarded to Ulster Rugby.

"Despite the obvious challenges connected with the playing of this fixture, and noting the incredible efforts of the Toyota Cheetahs and Rugby Nederland to ensure the fixture could take place, it is the hosting club's responsibility to ensure the match can go ahead; and therefore the match result must be recorded as a 0-28 four-try bonus point win for Ulster Rugby, with five match points being awarded as a consequence, pursuant to EPCR regulations."

In a statement to BBC Sport on Sunday afternoon, Ulster said they were "disappointed" the game would not be played but player welfare had to be the top priority.

"The safety of players, match officials and supporters must always be the priority, and we respect the referee's decision following the pitch inspection."

Ulster now move up into second Pool Three and are guaranteed a place in the round of 16 with the five points coming after an opening victory over Racing 92 in their opening European fixture before a narrow defeat in Cardiff. The Cheetahs now remain without a point following earlier defeats to Exeter Chiefs and Stade Francais.

Former Ulster fly-half Ian Humphreys, who was set to be on commentary for the game, said he had spoken to players and the pitch had been "rock hard".

"They said they had went out to warm up an hour before kick-off and they said it was pretty obvious the game couldn't be played, and that it was rock-hard," Humphreys said on Radio Ulster.

"It's frustrating for them and you can sense that off the messages from them. It feels a bit of a shambles."

Humphreys said there is "a massive sense of frustration", especially for players who had something to prove in what was a heavily rotated Ulster side.

"It's very frustrating. It's one of those ones where they moved it and brought it forward to try and prevent any problems but, unfortunately, it's one of those things," Humphreys added.

"It's out of everyone's control, so as frustrating as it is, there's not much they can do." 

It is the second game Ulster have had called off this season after their United Rugby Championship game in Edinburgh was postponed in October due to Storm Amy.

South African side Cheetahs were the home team for the game, but it was set to be played in the Netherlands. 

The Cheetahs had nominated the NCRA Stadium in the Dutch capital as their home venue for their European fixtures. 

Gareth Steenson, a European Cup winner with the Exeter Chiefs, said it was so teams could cut down on travel and save money from extensive flying back and forth from South Africa. 

"The Cheetahs do a lot of travelling so they are probably looking at being in Europe for a few weeks, which would save them travelling back and forth," he said.

"It's obviously frustrating because if it was in South Africa it definitely would have been played." 

Ulster defeated Racing 92 in their opener and will likely need another bonus-point win over Stade Francais if the Cheetahs game cannot be rescheduled

Ulster now sit second in Pool Three, three points behind Stade Francais with the sides to meet in Belfast on Saturday.

Any form of a win would see Richie Murphy's side overtake the Top 14 club and guarantee them top spot with Cardiff two points behind as it stands.

Sunday's cancellation also means Cardiff have qualified for the knockout stages with a match to spare.

Only a bonus-point win for the Cheetahs would have stopped the Welsh side progressing. 

Exeter Chiefs are also assured of a place in the last 16, meaning the four qualification spots in the pool are already decided.

Still, Ulster and Stade Francais will be keen to move into the knockout stage on a high.

Steenson added "a lot of decisions" will have to be made in terms of team selection for the game. 

"Stade came back from 22 points down against Exeter yesterday to win, and they will probably want to finish top of their group. 

"I would expect them to come to Belfast reasonably strong."

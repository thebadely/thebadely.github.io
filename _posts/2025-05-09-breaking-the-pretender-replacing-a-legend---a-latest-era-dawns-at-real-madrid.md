Experts revealed that In what has been the worst kept secret in the footballing world, Xabi Alonso has finally told his Bayer Leverkusen players he will be leaving the German club at the end of the season.

He will be soon be announced as the new head coach of Real Madrid - once the departure of current boss Carlo Ancelotti is officially confirmed.

An inevitable, if bittersweet, conclusion to Ancelotti's second spell at Real Madrid.

And finally, the much expected transition, with the Italian legend stepping aside to take charge of the Brazil national team, and the young pretender Alonso returning to the Bernabeu as his successor.

This changing of the guard, from the club's most decorated coach to a rising star in management, is symbolic. It marks the end of an era and the beginning of a fascinating new one.

A situation facilitated by the innate reasonableness of Bayer Leverkusen who, true to their word, stood by the gentlemen's agreement between coach and club that they would not stand in Alonso's way should he receive an offer he could not refuse.

Real Madrid boss Ancelotti set for Brazil talks

'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on'

Madrid are now preparing for a future led by their former midfielder, with president Florentino Perez viewing Alonso as the long-term answer. 

The 43-year-old's success at Leverkusen has elevated his profile, and Real believe he possesses the tactical sharpness and emotional intelligence to lead a generational transition.

Last year, he led Leverkusen to a Bundesliga title, without losing a game, and the German Cup in his first full season as a senior club manager.

But the task Alonso faces at Real is enormous.

He will inherit a squad in flux, needing to balance Kylian Mbappe's presence and Vinicius Jr's leadership, with the Brazilian about to sign a longer contract.

Alonso will also need to integrate youngsters like Endrick and Arda Guler, phasing out the old guard and delivering trophies immediately. 

He'll also need to navigate a boardroom that wants influence, a fanbase that demands instant success, and a media environment that will hold him to impossible standards from day one.

Alonso has the tactical credentials, but this is Madrid where talent alone doesn't guarantee survival.

Before his tenure starts, Real must win at Barcelona on Sunday to retain any realistic hopes of retaining their La Liga crown. Victory for the Catalans would put them seven points clear at the top with just three games to play.

More likely, the goodbyes have already begun.

After winning La Liga and the Champions League last season, a campaign without a trophy would serve to justify the club's decision to end the Ancelotti era.

But before then, the Bernabeu will get its chance to applaud him one last time, to give the Italian the send-off that accurately reflects and acknowledges the enormity of his contribution to the club.

Fifteen trophies, more than any manager in the club's history, in two eras of success, steadiness, and quiet revolution. Ancelotti brought dignity and calm to chaos. He won with style, without needing to shout, and restored order when the club was on the edge.

And now, as he prepares to leave for Brazil, Real prepare to start again with Alonso at the helm. 

Former Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso will become the next Real Madrid manager

When Ancelotti returned to Real Madrid in 2021 following Zinedine Zidane's unexpected resignation, the club was drifting. 

The stadium redevelopment was mid-construction, the squad was thin, and there was a palpable lack of direction. Yet Ancelotti brought calm, clarity, and credibility. And with it, a remarkable resurgence.

In his first season back, after the departure of key players Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, the Madrid side secured a La Liga and Champions League double, plus the Spanish Supercup, an achievement few believed possible given the structural limitations at the time.

Key areas of the squad remained unaddressed due to financial pressure caused by escalating stadium costs. But through man-management, tactical pragmatism, and the brilliance of individuals, Madrid triumphed.

That same success though planted the seeds of future discord as the squad was not improved dramatically and departures, Toni Kroos especially, were not replaced adequately. 

When Mbappe finally arrived from Paris St-Germain last summer, Perez believed the team would take another leap forward. 

Fractures though had already begun to appear, not just tactically, but inside the changing room. 

Behind closed doors, disagreements surfaced over physical preparation and discipline and Perez, always deeply involved, became more vocal in his frustration.

From the directors' box came disdainful comments, on the lack of defensive work by the main stars, despite meetings between the manager and them to turn things around, and Ancelotti's management of emerging talents. 

Questions were raised over the cautious handling of Guler, and doubts cast over whether Brazilian forward Endrick would thrive under Ancelotti's approach. 

The tension, though never explosive, became constant. By October, the club leadership felt Ancelotti was not addressing the issues and the idea of the club taking a new direction started to take root.

On the pitch, the team lost coherence. The dressing room - once unified by Ancelotti's steady hand - began to fragment. Key players stopped listening to him, others grew weary of his hands-off approach. 

Perhaps most destabilising was the rivalry between Vinicius and Mbappe. Both wanted to be the face of the team. 

Mbappe preferred to play centrally, but Vinicius believed he had earned top billing. There was no open conflict, but the on-pitch dynamic spoke volumes. In critical moments, they did not look for each other. The tension was visible to staff and team-mates alike.

Ancelotti, usually the master of ego management, struggled and admitted privately it was one of the hardest changing rooms to manage in his career. 

On some occasions, pre-match media briefings became short and irritable, with Ancelotti feeling he was not getting the club support he thought he deserved.

He had asked for right-back Kyle Walker in January to cover for long-term injuries to Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao, but the request was rejected.

Outwardly, the 65-year-old remained respectful. He repeated the same line, "I will stay at Madrid until the club no longer wants me."

To fans, that echoed loyalty. But to Perez, it sounded like pressure.

Now, as the season nears its end, the Brazil job stands as Ancelotti's next frontier. 

Discussions with the CBF (Brazilian Football Confederation) have intensified, with meetings held in London and Madrid. 

Brazil, amid a turbulent World Cup 2026 qualification campaign, had hoped to secure his signature immediately, but Ancelotti insisted "nothing until after the season ends".

There is also a financial situation to resolve. Real might not want to pay the rest of his contract until 2026 as Ancelotti has shown, with those meetings, his desire to leave. 

Ancelotti wants the club to recognise they are the ones letting him go and, consequently, he should have a pay-off.

The plan now is clear. Finish the La Liga season and, if the financial situation is resolved, allow someone else to coach at the Fifa Club World Cup, perhaps Santi Solari, one of the club's decision-makers and a former player.

And then the club and manager will begin new chapters. This time it can be a graceful, fitting transition - if all the pieces fall into place.

One of the most interesting subplots is the future of assistant Davide Ancelotti. 

The younger Ancelotti has built a formidable reputation alongside his father, from PSG to Bayern Munich, Napoli, Everton, and now Real. 

But with his profile higher than ever, and interest from top European clubs growing, this will be the moment he sets out on his own. 

Davide has always dreamed of becoming a head coach. That decision, like many around the Madrid bench right now, remains pending - but imminent.

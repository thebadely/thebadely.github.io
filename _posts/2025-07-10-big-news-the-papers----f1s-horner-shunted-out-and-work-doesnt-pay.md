Let's dive into the details: The Times leads on the possible new immigration deal between Britain and France ahead of today's summit in London. The paper says 50 migrants a week will be sent back to France from the end of August, as part of a pilot scheme - and, reportedly, the UK would accept the same number of asylum seekers in return, if they have family connections in Britain. The paper points out that if crossings continue at the same rate the number sent to France would equate to one in 17 of all small-boat migrants. 

The Daily Telegraph says the government is hoping the number of returns will grow significantly, if the trial is successful.

The Guardian however says the deal "hangs in the balance" - with negotiators haggling over how much the UK should pay towards policing the crossings. Aides from both countries tell the paper that other significant hurdles include potential legal challenges in France, and opposition from other European countries. A Downing Street spokesperson is quoted saying the prime minister hopes to make "concrete progress" on a range of issues.

The I Paper says Labour will target the rich with its new tax plans, but won't publicly call it a "wealth tax". The paper quotes an unnamed minister saying "we'll end up doing a few things that target wealthier people".

The Daily Express leads on resident doctors announcing a five-day strike over pay - saying it puts around 200,000 hospital appointments at risk of being cancelled. The paper's leader column calls the prime minister weak and says it's only a matter of time before Downing Street "waves the white flag".

The Daily Mail is among a number of papers to highlight a report by the right-leaning think tank, the Centre for Social Justice - which forecasts that full sickness benefits will soon be worth Â£2,500 a year more than the minimum wage. "Proof Work Doesn't Pay Under Labour" is the Mail's headline.

A picture of the former Red Bull Racing Formula One boss, Christian Horner, with his head in his hands covers the front of The Daily Star. He was fired yesterday after 20 years in the role. Its headline reads "Red Bull gives you the boot".

According to new developments, It had been an emotional few days after it emerged Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport and Media, are in talks to buy Welsh rivals Cardiff

United Rugby Championship

Ospreys (19) 24

Tries: Ratti, Hopkins, Morse, Kasende Cons: Edwards 2

Lions (12) 24

Tries:  F Horn 2, PJ Botha, Q Horn Cons: Smith 2

Ospreys finished a traumatic week by battling to a bonus-point draw with Lions in the United Rugby Championship (URC).

Wales fly-half Dan Edwards missed a 79th penalty which would have won the game for the hosts, while Lions wing Angelo Davids spurned a last-gasp try. 

It had been an emotional few days after it emerged Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport and Media, are in talks to buy Welsh rivals Cardiff.

The move is threatening the Ospreys' future as a professional side beyond 2027 and provided a troubled build-up for Mark Jones' side.

They handled the situation professionally in atrocious conditions with tries from flanker James Ratti, full-back Iestyn Hopkins, number eight Morgan Morse and wing Daniel Kasende.

Lions responded with two tries from captain Francke Horn and further scores from hooker PJ Botha and full-back Quon Horn.

Wales captain Dewi Lake escaped a red card for a dangerous tackle as the Ospreys hooker was one of four players sin-binned during a physical encounter.

Lions remain in seventh place, while Ospreys rise one spot to eighth and into the play-off places.

Ospreys fans showing their support for their side

It was six days between Ospreys' previous home game against Montpellier and this occasion.

Given the build-up, it must have seemed much longer for players, coaches and supporters.

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has proposed cutting one of its four men's professional sides - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - to the dismay of many fans across the country.

It was the Ospreys that have found themselves in the firing line this week. 

On Monday evening, news emerged that Ospreys' owners were the preferred bidders in a deal to purchase Cardiff from the WRU.

This was not confirmed officially by the WRU and Ospreys until Thursday and this period of flux created panic and uncertainty in the ranks of players, coaches, staff and supporters.

On Tuesday, the Ospreys had a stormy meeting with chief executive Lance Bradley where "one or two of the players" walked out early and a full contact training session was cancelled.

The following day, head coach Jones faced the press where he said the Ospreys squad had been told of the Y11 interest in Cardiff and stated they had no clarity on the future.

It was not until 24 hours later that the news was confirmed, when it was unveiled both Cardiff and Ospreys would continue as separate teams but both be owned by Y11.

The only guarantee given to the Ospreys was they would play in the URC and Europe competitions until after the end of next season. 

There have been no assurances Ospreys will remain a professional side after the summer of 2027. 

All this turmoil when they had an important game to prepare for. An occasion when centre Keiran Williams ran out for his 100th Ospreys game. A landmark that should be celebrated but had been overshadowed.

Ospreys fans made their feelings known towards the Welsh Rugby Union and their owners Y11 Sport and Media

Ospreys are currently playing out of Bridgend this season where a crowd of 4,052 turned out to watch in wet and windy conditions.

Fans were asked to light their phone torches on 11 minutes as a message to say "they will not ignore the disgraceful treatment of Ospreys players, staff, and supporters".

The crowd obliged and there were resounding boos directed towards rugby bosses. 

Ospreys staff had been in tears this week not knowing what the future holds and that frustration was shared by the fans.  

Lynne Jones, of Ospreys Supporters Club said she feels let down by the WRU and Y11.

"I'm emotional, angry and upset, it's devastating," she told BBC Wales Today.

"The silence from the WRU - it's not on."

Sarah Collins-Davies, chair of the Ospreys Supporters Club added: "It's been an emotional week for the supporters, but I can't imagine how difficult it has been for the players and coaches.

Ospreys supporter Annette Davies says she is fearful for the future with so many unanswered questions.

"There has to be clarity," said Davies.

"We're told there will be an Ospreys side next season - what does that mean? Are we ending next season? Are we even going to have the players to have a season, because we have a lot of players out of contract.

"Who's going to want to sign for us? Knowing they might not be here at the end of that following season."

The Ospreys have produced Wales and British and Irish Lions internationals like Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Biggar, Adam Jones, Shane Williams and Justin Tipuric and attracted star names like Justin Marshall, Tommy Bowe, Jerry Collins, Marty Holah and Ryan Jones.

They are the most successful Welsh team in terms of silverware since the inception of regional rugby in 2003, although their last trophy was in 2012.

An illustrious past. But what an uncertain future looks like, remains to be seen.

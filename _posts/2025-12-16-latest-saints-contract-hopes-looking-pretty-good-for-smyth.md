Let's dive into the details: Charlie Smyth kicked a match-winning field goal for the New Orleans Saints against the Carolina Panthers 

New Orleans Saints kicker Charlie Smyth says "we're looking pretty good" as he looks to secure a place on their permanent 53-man roster. 

The former gaelic footballer kicked a winning 46-yard field goal with six seconds left in his home debut on Sunday against the Carolina Panthers, which was his third NFL appearance.

Smyth also landed a 56-yard field goal and made an onside kick on his NFL debut  against the Miami Dolphins, and featured against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

After three practice squad elevations already this season, NFL rules state the 24-year-old would need to be signed to the 53-man roster in order to feature against the New York Jets on Sunday.

"I think we're looking pretty good on that right now," said Smyth.

"I'm delighted to have had those moments over the past few weeks and hopefully I can help the team going forward." 

Smyth added he was letting "everyone else deal with that in the background" as his focus shifted towards Sunday's game with the Jets at the Superdome. 

"The hope is that I'll get into the 53 next week, that's the plan," he said.

"I would like to think I'm playing this week, so we'll just let that take care of itself and I'll stay focused on what I do, which is kicking a ball."

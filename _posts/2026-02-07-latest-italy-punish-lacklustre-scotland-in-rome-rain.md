Italy grind out win over Scotland to  pile pressure on Townsend

Italy (15) 18

Tries: Lynagh, Menoncello Cons: Garbisi Pens: Garbisi 2

Scotland (7) 15

Tries: Dempsey, Horne Cons: Russell Pens: Russell

Scotland are facing a washout of a Six Nations campaign after suffering a dispiriting opening loss to Italy in rain-soaked Rome.

Having come from 12 points behind to stun the Scots in 2024, this time the Italians raced into a 12-point lead.

The gap was down to three by the final whistle but Scotland did not do enough as the hosts made the most of their rapid start, superior set-piece and solid discipline.

Italy scored from their first attack as Louis Lynagh slid in to finish off a lovely grubber kick from Juan Ignacio Brex.

The Scottish defence was exposed again soon after, with Jamie Dobie beaten to a high ball and Tommaso Menoncello speeding down the left flank to score with ease.

Amid a torrential downpour, Jack Dempsey powered through from close range to reduce the deficit.

But Paolo Garbisi popped over a penalty after an astonishing drop-goal miss from right in front of the posts to give Italy an eight-point advantage at the interval.

With players aquaplaning across the soggy surface and the error count sky high, Finn Russell and Garbisi exchanged penalties before Scotland's replacement hooker George Turner was sent to the bin for a rash clear-out.

The conditions were near farcical, the ball frequently squirming through fingers and set-pieces a mess, with Scotland making the lion's share of blunders.

Then, almost out of nowhere, replacement scrum-half George Horne slithered across the grass and into the corner, although Russell could not add the extras.

A three-point game going into the final 10 minutes, Italy held their nerve and did the simple things better to see out a deserved victory.

'I believe in what we're doing' - Townsend

Conditions don't excuse Scotland errors

Much of the talk in the build up centred around Scotland's vulnerability in last 20 minutes, but it was a sluggish start that undid Gregor Townsend's side.

Lineouts were going astray before the foul weather set in and the new-look back three did not look too clever for the opening scores.

Italy played with more passion and pace in the first 15 minutes and Scotland struggled to find any kind of response.

Scotland just could not get themselves into Italian territory often enough, laboured running hampered by mistake after mistake.

Star backs Russell and Huw Jones were anonymous but this was a day for forwards and they lost the fight, by a distance larger than the final outcome suggests.

Next up is a Valentine's Day date with England at Murrayfield and, if that one goes awry, the considerable heat on Townsend is only going to increase.

Townsend speaks after defeat in Rome

A first opening weekend win since 2013 will buoy Italy, who are missing several key players.

While Scotland could boast a clean bill of health, the Azzurri were without Ange Capuozzo and Sebastian Negri, along with Tommaso Allan, Ross Vincent, Gianmarco Lucchesi and Jacopo Trulla.

Man-for-man they won most of their battles and absolutely dominated the scrum.

Lynagh was a menace in the first half and Menoncella has grit to go with his considerable guile and grace. 

They go to Dublin on the back of 16 successive defeats to Ireland.

There was just five points between the teams in Rome last year and it could be another close contest at the Aviva Stadium, especially if the heavens open again.

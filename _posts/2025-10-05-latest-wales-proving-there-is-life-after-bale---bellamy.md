Experts revealed that Craig Bellamy began his reign with an unbeaten six-game start â the best by any Wales manager

It is nearly three years since Gareth Bale brought the curtain down on his glittering Wales career at the 2022 World Cup.

He bowed out after a 3-0 defeat by England in Qatar, with many predicting Wales would go back to the doldrums without their most-capped player and record goalscorer.

But Wales boss Craig Bellamy is out to prove the Bale doom-mongers wrong, having lost only two of his 12 games in charge.

"I was told before [being appointed] that it was all falling off a cliff. The king [Bale] has gone," said Bellamy.

"But I only saw it as like, 'no, there's a lot of good players here'. 

"Wait until the next couple of years, this machine's going to get stronger."

Wales recall Ramsey for Belgium and England games

Bellamy will take his young side to play England in a Wembley friendly on Thursday, their first meeting since that World Cup group match.

Both sides will use the fixture to prepare for their World Cup qualifying ties, with Wales needing to beat Belgium in Cardiff on 13 October to maintain hopes of topping Group J and securing automatic qualification for next summer's finals.

"I want us in there on a consistent basis because that's where we play the best teams," said Bellamy.

"We need to be in tournaments because we play the best teams.

"If we want to be a top football nation, which we've flirted with at times, I want us to be able to try and do it all the time."

Gareth Bale challenges Ashley Young during their 2011 Wembley meeting

Wales lost 3-0 on their previous trip to Wembley on a disappointing night under Ryan Giggs five years ago.

But it is a European Championship qualifier meeting in 2011 which Bellamy recalls fondly.

A first-half winner from Ashley Young settled a tight affair against a Gary Speed Wales side, but only after Robert Earnshaw missed a late chance to snatch a draw.

"I don't like defeats but watching the team play the way they did was one of the proudest I've been," said Bellamy, who missed the game through suspension. 

"I remember Speedo on the side with his chest up and I was like 'wow'.

"To watch the group of players go to Wembley and dominate the way they did - and they really did.

"Earnie missed a chance but we played the way he [Speed] wanted to play. That to me always burns and I'd love to have that moment, but with a result going our way."

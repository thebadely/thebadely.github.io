According to new developments, Monday morning's papers are dominated by the US strikes on Iran.

"Trump pushes Middle East to the brink" is the headline on the i Paper, while the Financial Times warns that the US president has "opened a Pandora's box". The paper says he had "gambled that the operation could hurt the Islamic Republic, without provoking a military backlash". 

But, according to the Guardian, the question of whether the US "will become embroiled in a drawn-out war" now appears to be in the hands of Tehran. Under the headline "Stick it up your bunker", the Sun says global security is "teetering on a knife edge" as "the world holds its breath" while Iran considers its response.

According to the Daily Telegraph, "any sign of weakness could undermine" the country's supreme leader, but "attacking US interests could bring an even greater American assault".

Government sources tell the Times that the UK was "taken by surprise" by the speed at which President Trump launched the strikes. The paper reports that while his actions "have put strain on the special relationship", the decision to leave the UK out of the conflict for now means it could be spared from the immediate threat of retaliation. 

But the Daily Express highlights concerns that Britain could become a target. The Daily Mail says it could face a "terror backlash". Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror leads with appeals for calm to avoid "plunging the world into war". Its headline is simply: "Stop now".

Sir Keir Starmer writes in the Financial Times that his new industrial strategy marks a "new phase for the government" - "a shift away from fixing inherited problems to delivering change and renewal people can feel". He calls the plan "robust and strategic" and says it will "meet the challenges of our era".

In the Telegraph, Nigel Farage writes that Reform UK's new policy on non-doms will "actively encourage the return of wealth and talent" to the UK. He says the plans will directly benefit "the hard-working backbone of this nation", and denies they are a "golden visa" or "backdoor to citizenship".

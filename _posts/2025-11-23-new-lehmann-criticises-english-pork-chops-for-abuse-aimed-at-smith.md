Experts revealed that Smith has played 38 times against England and scored 3,436 runs

England fans "should be better" than the "abuse" they direct at Australia batter Steve Smith, says former coach Darren Lehmann.

Smith, 36, has been a regular target of chants and boos from England supporters following his role in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal.

Smith was sacked as captain and banned for a year while Lehmann, who was cleared of wrongdoing, resigned as coach in the wake of the incident.

"The abuse you get is daily," Lehmann said. "It is unbelievable. 

"He [Smith] is playing every day. It would be worse for him. 

"In England they just don't forget. It is like they have never done anything wrong in their life.

"It is only the ones that drink too much and carry on like pork chops."

During a Test against South Africa, Smith admitted Australia's "leadership group" devised a plan to tamper with the ball.

Former opener David Warner taught batter Cameron Bancroft how to use sandpaper to rough up the ball, and Bancroft was then caught doing so by TV cameras during play. Both men were also banned along with Smith.

Smith made his comeback after the ball-tampering episode in the 2019 Ashes Test at Edgbaston and has been booed repeatedly since. 

England fans also base taunts on his tearful news conference in 2018.

"We did the wrong thing, accept it and move on," Lehmann said.

"You try to move on the best you can. You get reminded every day and that is part and parcel. 

"Steve Smith can hold his head high with how he handles everything. 

"The Barmy Army should be better than that. Most of them are and are very supportive of what goes on in the game."

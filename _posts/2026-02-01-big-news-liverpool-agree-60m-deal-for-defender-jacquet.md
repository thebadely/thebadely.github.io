According to new developments, Jeremy Jacquet was named in the Under-19 Euros team of the tournament in 2024

Liverpool have agreed a Â£60m deal for Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet - but the centre-half will not be joining the club in the current transfer window.

Subject to a medical, the 20-year-old will move to the Reds in the summer after the clubs reached agreement on a Â£55m fee plus Â£5m in add-ons.

Personal terms are not expected to be an issue with the France Under-21 international.

Chelsea are known to have held talks with Jacquet during the winter window, but it is understood they will not match Liverpool's bid.

Liverpool are looking to bolster their centre-back options, with France defender Ibrahima Konate's current contract set to expire at the end of this season.

Arne Slot's side missed out on Marc Guehi last summer, with the England centre-half then opting to join Manchester City in January.

Jacquet came through the Rennes academy and has played for the club 18 times this season, with a string of standout performances making him a target for some of Europe's elite sides - and Liverpool see him as a long-term investment.

Let's dive into the details: Paolini and Errani won Olympic doubles gold last year in Paris then the 2025 French Open title

Jasmine Paolini guided holders Italy to another Billie Jean King Cup final by winning a gruelling match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina before sealing the tie in a decisive doubles encounter alongside partner Sara Errani.

World number eight Paolini came from a set down to win an exhilarating match against Svitolina 3-6 6-4 6-4 and force the deciding doubles.

French Open and Olympic champions Paolini and Errani then beat Marta Kostyuk and Lyudmyla Kichenok 6-2 6-3 to seal a 2-1 victory in the tie in Shenzhen.

Ukraine, competing in the semi-finals for the first time, had put their first point on the board when Kostyuk beat Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-2 6-3 in the opening match.

Italy will meet Great Britain or the United States, who face each other in the semi-final on Saturday, in Sunday's showpiece.

Britain are chasing a maiden title while the US are pursuing a record-extending 19th.

World number 13 Svitolina's aggressive style had put Paolini on the back foot in their singles match and the Ukrainian took the opening set with a sizzling backhand winner.

Paolini then took an early break in the second set but Svitolina recovered and was one point away from leading 5-2 and putting herself within one game of securing her nation an unassailable lead in the tie.

But an inspired Paolini took advantage of Svitolina's errors and won the next four games to level the match.

The 29-year-old fought hard to hold in an eight-deuce game before moving 4-2 ahead and producing a gritty performance to level the tie at 1-1.

After an exhausting contest lasting two hours and 27 minutes, Paolini then partnered usual doubles partner Errani to clinch the decider.

Paolini spearheaded Italy's charge to the 2024 title and looks well on her way to doing the same again here.

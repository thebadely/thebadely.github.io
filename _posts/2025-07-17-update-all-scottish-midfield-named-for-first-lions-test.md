According to new developments, Huw Jones and Sione Tuipulotu

The British and Irish Lions will field an all-Scottish fly-half and centre trio for the first time in history when they take on Australia in the first Test in Brisbane on Saturday.

Finn Russell, Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones start for Andy Farrell's team, with Ireland and England making up the rest of the starting line-up and squad. 

The Welsh hope, Jac Morgan, has failed to make the 23. This is the first time the Lions have named a squad against Australia, New Zealand or South Africa without a Welshman since 1896.

Ireland have eight starters and another three on the bench. England have four starters, with five more among the replacements.

Tom Curry has won a fiercely contested battle for the number seven jersey, getting the nod ahead of Morgan and Josh van der Flier.

The experienced Tadhg Beirne has being picked at blindside flanker ahead of Ollie Chessum, who had made a particularly strong case for inclusion.

There is no Owen Farrell in the 23 despite a dramatic mid-tour call-up and an encouraging cameo against an AUNZ Invitational side in Adelaide on Saturday. 

As expected, Blair Kinghorn has failed to recover from injury and the full-back spot goes to Hugo Keenan, with the in-form Tommy Freeman and the fairly quiet - by his standards - James Lowe on the wings.

Jamison Gibson-Park partners Russell at half-back.

The front row was predictable, Ellis Genge, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong combining with Joe McCarthy and captain Maro Itoje behind them.

Keenan, Freeman, Jones, Tuipulotu, Lowe, Russell, Gibson-Park; Genge, Sheehan, Furlong. Itoje, McCarthy, Beirne, Curry, Conan.

Replacements: Kelleher, Porter, Stuart, Chessum, Earl, Mitchell, M Smith, Aki

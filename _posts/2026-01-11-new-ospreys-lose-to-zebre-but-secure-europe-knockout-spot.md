Let's dive into the details: Ospreys centre Keiran Williams has played one international for Wales

European Challenge Cup

Zebre (13) 23

Tries: Fusco, Locatelli Cons: da Re 2 Pens: da Re 3

Ospreys (0) 19

Tries: Morse, K Williams, Edwards Cons: Edwards 2

Ospreys have qualified for the Challenge Cup knockout stages despite a 23-19 defeat by Zebre.

Mark Jones' side gained the losing bonus point needed to secure a place in the last 16 but could not gain a third victory in the European tournament this season after previous bonus-point successes against Connacht and Montauban.

Zebre sealed victory with a late try from flanker Samuele Locatelli with outside-half Giacomo da Re kicking 13 points.

Ospreys scored tries through number eight Morgan Morse, centre Keiran Williams and fly-half Dan Edwards.

Ospreys will face Montpellier in Bridgend in the final group game on Saturday, 17 January, which will be a top-of-the-table clash after the French side defeated Connacht 33-31.

Zebre took control in the first-half with a try from scrum-half Alessandro Fusco and eight points from da Re.

Ospreys had a concerted amount of pressure but a potential try for Morse was ruled out after centre Williams was penalised for obstruction in the build-up.

The Italians led 13-0 at half-time with Ospreys withdrawing Wales captain Dewi Lake during the break for hooker Lewis Lloyd, who provided an impressive ball-carrying presence.

Morse gained his reward with an early second-half try before centre Williams scythed through the Zebre defence with Edwards' conversion giving Ospreys the lead for the first time.

A third da Re penalty restored Zebre's advantage before Edwards cantered over, following a floated pass from replacement scrum-half Reuben Morgan-Williams.

But Ospreys could not hold on to the lead with Zebre flanker Locatelli securing the late crucial score.

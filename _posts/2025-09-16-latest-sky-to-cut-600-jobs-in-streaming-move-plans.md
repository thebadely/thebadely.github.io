Let's dive into the details: Sky is planning to cut 600 UK jobs as it looks to focus on its streaming services.

The media organisation has launched a consultation on proposed changes, which affect 900 roles. However, it expects 600 positions will be axed.

About two-thirds of jobs to go are understood to be at sites in Leeds, London and Livingston, West Lothian.

Since 2023, Sky has cut almost 3,000 roles including engineers installing satellite dishes and earlier this year it announced the closure of three call centres, slashing 2,000 jobs.

Sky, which employs more than 20,000 people in the UK, is understood to be wanting to refocus efforts on improving its digital and TV services, rather than creating new platforms.

According to the broadcaster, the cuts are not part of a cost-cutting exercise nor are they based on individual performance. 

A spokesperson for the broadcaster said in recent years it had launched a set of  products including Sky Glass, Sky Stream and a full fibre broadband service.

"As we look ahead, we are shifting our approach to bring customers the next generation of experience by investing in digital-first service, unbeatable content, and even better performance from our products, powered by the best of global innovation," they said.

Matt Trickett, head of media at Ampere Analysis, said: "Restructures are never easy for those involved but at a topline level this is likely to affect less than 5% of the overall workforce factoring in redeployments.

He said the cuts were "aimed at overlapping internal functions and changing priorities, as the company focuses in on its Sky Glass and Sky Stream TV products".

Experts revealed that Joe Burgess scored four tries against Salford to equal the Hull Kingston Rovers Super League record

Betfred Super League

Salford (6) 12

Tries: Sangare, Glover Goals: Morgan (2)

Hull KR (34) 74

Tries: Davies (2), Broadbent, Sue, Burgess (4), Martin (2), Litten (2), Lewis, Mourgue Goals: Mourgue (2), Martin (7)

Joe Burgess scored four of Hull Kingston Rovers' 14 tries as they thrashed depleted Salford to open up a four-point gap at the top of Super League.

The winger equalled the club's Super League record for tries in a match as Mikey Lewis came up with nine assists and a try of his own to make it back-to-back wins for the leaders.

Salford, hampered by financial problems and a player exodus this season, suffered more woe this week as another late payment of wages meant some players were unavailable, and their patched-up side was under the cosh from the first minute.

The Robins were ruthless as they piled on the points to claim their biggest win.

Tom Davies added two tries to take his tally to 99 in Super League, while Rhyse Martin also went over the line twice and kicked his 1,000th point in the competition with seven conversions.

Salford's problems were evident as they were forced to add Jamie Pye to the bench at the last moment, which meant they were restricted to seven interchanges rather than the usual eight, as he had not been named in the original matchday squad.

Rovers scored after just 65 seconds through Davies despite Salford receiving from the kick-off. When Lewis sent in both Jack Broadbent and Sauaso Sue inside the opening 10 minutes, the writing was already on the wall for Paul Rowley's side, who were also missing players through injury.

They managed to ruffle the leaders' feathers as Justin Sangare powered over for a surprise try, and Tyrone May was sin-binned for dissent.

But it made no difference as Lewis kicked for Burgess to score, and sent both Martin and Jez Litten over with passes before another magical kick in another lethal combination with Burgess down the left flank.

Lewis was soon at it again after the break, lobbing the ball over the top for Burgess once again, with Martin's conversion, after he took over from the misfiring Arthur Mourgue, taking him to the 1,000-point mark in the competition.

Yet another Lewis kick brought Burgess his fourth of the match and the reigning Man of Steel claimed a try of his own from Peta Hiku's pass before teeing up Mourgue as the Robins maintained a point-a-minute ratio.

Davies had opened the scoring but then had to watch as his opposite winger grabbed the glory, but he got back in on the act before Salford grabbed another consolation, with 20-year-old Charlie Glover getting his first Super League try.

Martin and Litten rounded off the scoring as the Robins equalled their biggest Super League winning margin of 62, which had only been set in the 68-6 win against Catalans Dragons in June.

Hull KR coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside:

"We started well and then had a 15-minute period where we gave a couple of penalties away, had some ill-discipline and a couple of errors [and conceded] a soft try through the middle.

"Then we found our groove again and put a couple of tries together but in the second half we suffocated them, had good field position and scored some nice tries. Again, I wasn't happy with their try through the middle.

"It's a sad situation we [Super League] are in, and more so Salford. Tonight's not good for anyone. It's on TV which won't get any audiences.

"It especially doesn't help Paul Rowley and the players. It's a weird feeling because any game is hard to win and you want to enjoy it, but it's a bit of an empty feeling because of the situation that people are in. Others need to be made accountable."

Salford coach Paul Rowley said:

"The team I had at 9am changed by 10am and then 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock and one o'clock so I decided just to rock up and see who's playing. It's been a busy day with a lot of changes.

"Thresholds will be reached. It's really tough for supporters in particular. I pay tribute to the lads who do their utmost to play and the staff who continue to have an attitude that as long as lads are playing we'll be there for them.

"Everybody has got an individual threshold."

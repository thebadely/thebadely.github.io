It has been recently reported that The Times reports that ministers are considering changes to "soften" planned cuts to the welfare system, after criticism from their own backbench MPs. 

A government source is quoted as saying that "tweaks" are being sought. The paper says this could include offering affected disability benefit claimants more time to find new support.

According to the front page of the Daily Express, "Labour's U-turn" on the winter fuel allowance has "descended into total chaos". 

Aides for No 10 are said to be "scrambling" to find a way to ensure more older people get the payment, after Sir Keir Starmer changed tack last week.

An investigation by the Guardian has found that only a third of the recommendations from major reports commissioned to tackle endemic racism in the UK over the last 40 years have been implemented. 

The analysis has been published to coincide with the five-year anniversary of the Black Lives Matter protests that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The Times says Britain is to ask Kosovo to take small boat migrants as part of the government's plan to open a series of so-called "return hubs" overseas. 

The country is said to be on a shortlist, drawn up by ministers and officials, where rejected asylum seekers would be sent after they have exhausted all their avenues of appeal in the UK.

The Daily Telegraph reports that a "world-first brain scanning technique" could help to identify signs of Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms appear. 

The team behind the tool, which works by analysing the cell structure of the brain, has said it could bring hope for millions of people with concerns about dementia.

And most of the papers reflect on the life of the former BBC executive and presenter, Alan Yentob, who has died at the age of 78. 

The Times remembers him as "dominant creative force" who had an unwavering commitment to the BBC's mission to inform and educate. But the paper notes that the long list of popular comedies and dramas he commissioned show he "never forgot the requirement to entertain". 

The i Paper calls him a champion of culture. The Sun and the Daily Mail describe him as the "King of TV".

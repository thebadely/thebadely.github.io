Here’s what you need to know: A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.

Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. 

"When you need to move fast," reads a banner under the image. "The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper."

Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.

Speaking to the AFP news agency on Wednesday, the company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, said when it became clear no one was injured in the heist they used "a touch of humour" to draw attention to the family-run business.

"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us," Mr Böcker said.

"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company." 

Reaction to Böcker's new campaign have been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including "marketing genius" and "excellent, that is German quality".

"Your messaging takes the crown," one commenter quipped.

Mr Böcker told AFP he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold "a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area".

The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he added.

The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors and visitors had started to file through its corridors.

Within eight minutes, they made off with some of France's most valuable treasure belonging to former royalty or imperial rulers.

Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.

The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.

The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that the Louvre failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and "aging".

"We failed these jewels," Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from "brutal criminals - not even the Louvre".

"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it," she added.

Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had "every confidence" the thieves would be caught.

Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.

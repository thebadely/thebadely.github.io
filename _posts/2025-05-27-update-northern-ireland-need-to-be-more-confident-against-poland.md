Experts revealed that Laura Rafferty was part of the Northern Ireland squad that qualified for Euro 2022

Northern Ireland defender Laura Rafferty says her side should take belief into Friday's crucial Nations League game against Poland at Seaview.

Tanya Oxtoby's side lost 2-0 away to the Euro 2025-bound Poles in February and go into the final two matches of their Group B1 campaign trailing the leaders by three points thanks to subsequent home wins over Bosnia-Herzogovina and Romania, plus an away draw with the Romanians.

A win over Poland would put Northern Ireland in control of their own destiny in terms of potentially winning the group going into Tuesday's trip to Zenica to play Bosnia-Herzegovina.

"We spoke about our aims from the start and coming into the last two games we're completely on target and we know what we have to do," said Rafferty.

"Going into this game I think we need to be more confident [than in the defeat by Poland]. It's a massive game for us and the only thing we want from it is a win.

"We're looking forward to it and we're just dissecting their [Poland's] games. Teams have strengths, but they have weaknesses too and it's what you do to exploit them."

Eighteen-year-old goalkeeper Kate Smith became the latest young player to be drafted into the NI squad on Monday, joining the likes of fellow stopper Abbie Smith, Aimee Kerr, Abi Sweetlove, Keri Halliday and Kascie Weir.

As one of the more experienced players in the squad, Rafferty says the mood in the camp in advance of the double-header is "upbeat" and the youthful players are blending in well.

"We've got so many young players who come in without fear, a lot of younger additions who are coming in and thoroughly enjoying it.

"The experiences and the learning that they'll get from this camp alone will be amazing for their journeys."

Rafferty was introduced as a substitute in Rangers' Scottish Cup final win over Glasgow City

The former Chelsea, Brighton and Southampton player, who also had a loan spell with Bristol City, has just completed her first season as part of the Rangers squad.

Her club agonisingly lost out to Hibernian on the final day of the Scottish Women's Premier League season but seven days later defeated Glasgow City 3-0 to win the Women's Scottish Cup final on Sunday, adding that trophy to the Women's Premier League Cup they collected in March.

"I've absolutely loved every minute at Rangers, there have been a lot of fantastic moments during the year and some harder moments recently with the league.

"When you play for a club like Rangers you want to take all three [trophies], that's the mentality that you have to show.

"It hurt that Sunday, what happened [losing out on the league], massive congratulations to Hibs, but we then had the chance to end the season on a high going into the Glasgow City game and we wanted to leave no regrets. 

"At the end of the day the trophy was ours and we wanted to keep our name on it. We're glad to get the job done."

The 29-year-old centre-back hopes to make further progress in her second season in Scotland.

"I've experienced a lot - new league, new players and a new environment, that will be massive to help me progress even more next year."

It has been recently reported that Nigeria and Liverpool forward Asisat Oshoala won the first BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award

The BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award launched in 2015.

It is decided by a global public vote after a panel of experts - including coaches, players, administrators and journalists - selects a five-player shortlist.

Here are the previous winners:

2015: Asisat Oshoala

Nigeria and Liverpool forward Asisat Oshoala was the very first BBC Women's Footballer of the Year.

Also shortlisted were Veronica Boquete, Nadine Kessler, Kim Little and Marta.

Also nominated that year were Pernille Harder, Sam Kerr, Saki Kumagai and Lindsey Horan.

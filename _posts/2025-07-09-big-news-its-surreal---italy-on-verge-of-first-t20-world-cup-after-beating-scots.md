Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Italy have been members of the International Cricket Council since 1984

Men's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier

Italy won by 12 runs

Scorecard

Italy captain Joe Burns says it feels "very surreal" after his side took a major step towards qualifying for their first T20 World Cup with a surprise 12-run victory over Scotland.

The Azzurri, ranked 32nd in the world, have moved to the top of the European Regional Qualifying group on five points, two ahead of Scotland, and have a superior net run rate.

Victory over second-placed Netherlands in their final game will rubberstamp Italy's place at the tournament, but they remain in a good position even if they lose.

Scotland will need to win big against Jersey in their final game on Friday (10:00 BST) to substantially improve their net run rate of -0.150 and hope Italy's, currently +1.722, takes a hit. 

Burns, who played 23 Tests for Australia before pledging his allegiance to Italy last year, said he side "technically cannot celebrate too hard at the moment" after the win in the Hague and acknowledged "there's still a big game on Friday".

"I am really proud of the boys for this moment," Burns said. "To come and beat Scotland, who are a fantastic team, is a nice reward for sacrifices our players, staff and federation have made.

"Hopefully this is the stepping stone for a lot to come. It's a very emotional group at the moment. Being on the verge of a World Cup? It's very surreal."

Burns eyes legacy with Italy step away from T20 World Cup

Richie Berrington made his Scotland debut in 2008

After Burns won the toss at Voorburg Cricket Club and decided to bat, Italy posted 167-6 from their 20 overs thanks largely to an blistering 50 off 21 balls from Emilio Gay.

The Durham batter, who qualifies via his English-Italian mother, smashed six fours and two sixes before he was caught by George Munsey off the bowling of Michael Leask.

Off-spinner Leask then dismissed Marcus Campopiano next ball to stymie Italy's momentum en route to figures of 3-18.

However, Grant Stewart played a crucial hand for the Italians as he finished unbeaten on 44 having hit three sixes and two fours off 27 balls.

Scotland, who beat the Dutch and saw their match against Guernsey washed out, appeared on course for victory when opener Munsey and captain Richie Berrington put on 105 for the third wicket as Italy looked set to be punished for dropped catches.

However, when Munsey was caught by Burns off Manenti for a 61-ball 72 with 16 balls remaining, Italy's bowlers started to turn turned the screw.

New batters Leask and Matthew Cross struggled to time the ball on a pitch which took time to get in on and both were dismissed by  Manenti, who finished with 5-31, as he and Stewart conceded just one boundary in the final three overs.

The Dutch moved into second place by easing aside bottom-placed Guernsey by 73 runs in the afternoon match, with the islanders falling short on 99-9 in response to the hosts' 172-1.

Scotland's best chance of qualification now rests with beating Jersey and hoping the Italians can beat the Dutch in Friday's later game.

Scotland captain Berrington, who finished unbeaten on 46 off 37 balls, said his side must quickly pick themselves up for the meeting with Jersey.

"We kept ourselves in it but just didn't manage to execute at the end," he said. "A lot of the credit has to go to Italy, who outskilled us with the ball in those conditions.

"Obviously today's a tough one, but it's important we learn what we can from this game. We will be looking to come back strong.

"We have to focus on coming back on Friday and looking to win that game then the rest takes of itself."

Let's dive into the details: On the Lions' last trip to Australia back in 2013, head coach Warren Gatland picked 15 Wales players in his initial squad. By the decisive third Test, he had 10 Welshmen in his starting XV.

A little over a decade on, things are markedly different.

After 17 defeats on the spin, Welsh representation is provided by only two players: flanker Jac Morgan and scrum-half Tomos Williams.

It is the lowest number of Welshmen picked for a Lions squad in the modern era.

However, Wales can take comfort from the waxing and waning of other nations' fortunes.

In 2017, just two Scotland players - Tommy Seymour and Stuart Hogg - were picked in the initial squad. Now, they can boast eight in the 2025 squad.

Similarly Ireland had only two players in the 1993 squad selected to tour New Zealand and four for the 1997 trip to South Africa.

In this newest squad, they provide the most players - with Andy Farrell opting for 15 of those he coaches in his usual role as Ireland head coach.

There have been significantly more lopsided squads in the past.

In 2005, Sir Clive Woodward opted for 20 players from the England set-up with which he had won the Rugby World Cup two years earlier, including luring Lawrence Dallaglio and Neil Back out of international retirement.

Twenty years on the squad is lighter in experience with 26 first-time tourists. 

Nine players are on their second tour while captain Maro Itoje, his England and Saracens' team-mate Elliot Daly and Ireland prop Tadhg Furlong are pulling on the famous shirt for a third trip.

At club level, Leinster provide 12 players - nearly a quarter of the squad - and it could have been more.

Fly-half Sam Prendergast was strongly fancied to go on the tour, but Finn Russell, Fin Smith and Marcus Smith were preferred at 10.

Ryan Baird, Jamie Osborne and Robbie Henshaw were also outsiders for inclusion.

Glasgow Warriors and Northampton, champions of last season's United Rugby Championship and Premiership respectively, supply four players each, while captain Itoje is joined by Saracens team-mates Ben Earl and Daly.

There are 15 clubs represented in the 38-strong squad, including eight of the 10 Premiership teams, three of the four Irish provinces and both Scottish professional sides.

Blair Kinghorn, who plays for French side Toulouse, is the only player who plays their club rugby outside Britain and Ireland.

There is more than just pride at stake for those domestic club sides. They, like the players, are part of a newly-minted profit sharing agreement with the Lions. The more players they have on tour, they larger the pay cheque at the end.

It has been estimated , externalthat Leinster's healthy dozen will earn their club in excess of Â£1m.

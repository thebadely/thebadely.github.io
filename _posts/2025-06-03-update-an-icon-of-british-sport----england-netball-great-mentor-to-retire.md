Experts revealed that Geva Mentor is widely regarded as England's greatest netballer

Geva Mentor, regarded as the greatest netballer England has produced, will retire at the end of the Netball Super League season.

The 40-year-old Leeds Rhinos defender played 175 times for her country, the highlight of which was winning gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

She played more than 310 games at club level and was twice named the World's Best Netballer during a 24-year career.

Mentor made her Vitality Roses debut in 2000 against New Zealand aged 16 and represented her country in six World Cups.

She made history by becoming the first England Netball player to compete in six Commonwealth Games.

Mentor claimed bronze in the Commonwealth Games of 2006 and 2010 then won gold in 2018 when England beat Australia in the final. 

During her club career she has played in the ANZ Championship and Suncorp Super Netball - winning four championship titles - as well as the Super League. 

In 2018, Mentor was awarded a CBE for her outstanding contribution to international netball.

"The time has come to bring my playing career to an end," said Mentor, who also won two World Championship bronze medals with England.

"I am grateful to the people I've met along the way, the opportunities I've been able to experience and the memories I'll treasure forever.

"To my team-mates, coaches, supporters, sponsors, franchises, leagues and sport - thank you for challenging me, believing in me and allowing me to stay true to myself."

"For over 20 years, she has competed at the highest level and has been one of the game's biggest superstars and an icon in British sport," said Rhinos franchise director Dan Busfield.

"For a young franchise like ours to have someone with the experience and professionalism of Geva playing for our club and working with our staff and young players has been game-changing."

The Super League season ends on 6 July.

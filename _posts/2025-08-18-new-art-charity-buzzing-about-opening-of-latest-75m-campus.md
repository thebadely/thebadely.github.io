According to new developments, An art charity has said it is "absolutely buzzing" to be part of a £75m city centre university campus that officially opened its doors on Monday.

Art Shape, which works with the NHS to deliver all kinds of art as prescriptions, has access to new spaces in the University of Gloucestershire's City Campus, to use for activities.

The building, which will be a hub for 1,200 students and staff, was transformed from the old Debenhams in Gloucester's King's Square.

Kate Cox, from Art Shape, said the charity would now be able to expand its work linking creativity with wellbeing. "It's been amazing... to meet so many new partners and different organisations that we're going to be working alongside," she said.

The charity has been running in Gloucestershire since 1993.  

Ms Cox said: "We take an integrated approach to wellbeing, where your medical and clinical health can be really well supported by having creative and expressive practice alongside that. And there's a lot of evidence and research to support that thinking."

The new campus will host education, psychology and social work students.

Art Space has moved into its Arts, Health and Wellbeing Centre, on the first floor, next to teaching rooms.

Ms Cox said: "People can experience first-hand the benefits of creative health practices, but also learn how to apply these things within their education and medical training."

"I'm absolutely buzzing," she added. "It's such a gorgeous building."

Alex Cottrell, head of external relationships at the University of Gloucestershire, said City Campus had been designed as a "community campus" rather than a space only for students.

"All of our campuses are open, but this one in particular has been designed to integrate the local community, our students, local experts and other stakeholders," she said.

With the county public library due to move in later this year, the university says the building will become a hub not just for students, but also for local charities, businesses and the wider community.

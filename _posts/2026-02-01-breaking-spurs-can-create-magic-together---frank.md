Solanke Scorpion kick levels for Spurs in thrilling comeback

Dissent was in the air with Manchester City in total control at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

The hosts were two goals down and the deficit could and perhaps should have been more.

Yet on a day when campaign group Change for Tottenham called for an open revolt in the stands over the club's perceived lack of ambition in the transfer market and high ticket prices, Thomas Frank's side staged a superb fightback to draw 2-2.

By the time Dominic Solanke registered his second goal of the game with a wonderfully improvised scorpion kick, any possibility of a mass walkout had been averted.

Instead of concluding to half-empty stands, "Oh when the Spurs go marching in" reverberated around the ground at full-time in complete contrast to the chorus of boos only 60 minutes earlier.

"We can create something magic together - the players and the fans - when we are united like we were, especially second half but also the Dortmund game," Frank told BBC Sport.

"That atmosphere, intensity - that's what pushed the players and they really needed it.

"What I like and what I think is truly important is when your back is against the wall as a team and a group you need to fight. You can never give up.

"I love that never-say-die attitude from the players and the fans were massive for us. The mentality is building stronger and stronger."

'Big belief' got Spurs back into the game - Frank

While Tottenham sit 14th in the Premier League, they are now unbeaten in four matches in all competitions and have advanced to the last 16 of the Champions League.

The fit-again Solanke's return of four goals in four starts following his recovery from a recurring ankle issue has also eased the pressure on Frank, whose position at the club has been under significant scrutiny.

"I prefer it going more smooth, I think that is fair to say, but this is football," said Frank.

"In this spell I think we have done more good things than bad things, but not enough performances have turned into results. Now I am happy we have four decent performances and are unbeaten.

"It was a big point with that second-half performance. The players' mentality has been good throughout.

"It is quite evident that Dom has been a big miss for us. We've been without him for six months and now we have him back.

"Four goals in four games speaks its own language. He was very impressive and he is not fit yet. You could see in the last 15 minutes he could not run."

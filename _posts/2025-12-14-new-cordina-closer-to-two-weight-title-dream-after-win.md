Experts revealed that Joe Cordina won British and Commonwealth titles at lightweight earlier in his career

Joe Cordina is in line for a shot at becoming a two-weight world champion after dominating Gabriel Flores Jr in California on the way to a unanimous victory on points.

Wales' former IBF super-featherweight belt holder Cordina outboxed his American opponent, with judges scoring the contest 117-110 115-112 114-113.

The fight at the Adventist Health Arena in Stockton was billed as a final eliminator for the WBO lightweight world title which was won by Abdullah Mason in an epic encounter with Sam Noakes in November.

Cordina, 34, was docked a point in the sixth round for rabbit punching, but was more in control than the judges' cards suggested.

"I got the win, but it wasn't exactly the way I wanted to do it," said Cordina. 

"You can't come in and nick a fight off me. I kept applying pressure and forced him to the ropes, and he couldn't keep up with the pace."

The victory in Flores Jr's backyard is a second win in the lightweight division for Cordina, who returned from a 14-month lay-off with a hard-fought points win over Jaret Gonzalez Quiroz in July to claim the vacant WBO global lightweight title.

Cordina now boasts a professional record of 19 wins and one defeat (with nine KOs), his only loss coming to Anthony Cacace in May 2024 when he lost his 130lb title in Riyadh.

Flores, 25, did give the Cardiff-born fighter a scare in round seven with an uppercut that buckled his knees, but the American saw a six-fight winning steak ended to slip to 27-3 (eight KOs).

Cordina, who went into his first bout in America ranked number six by the WBO, should now emerge as their number one contender and mandatory challenger to Mason.

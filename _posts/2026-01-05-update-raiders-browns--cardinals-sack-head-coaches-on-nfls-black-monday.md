Myles Garrett breaks sack record in NFL plays of the week

Las Vegas Raiders head coach Pete Carroll, Cleveland Browns' Kevin Stefanski and the Arizona Cardinals' Jonathan Gannon have all been sacked with the NFL's 'Black Monday' in full swing. 

Carroll, 74, who spent 14 years in his previous role the Seattle Seahawks and won a Super Bowl, lasted just one season with the Raiders. 

His departure after a dreadful 3-14 season - the joint-worst record in the NFL - was announced by owner Mark Davis, with part-owner Tom Brady to play a role in the search for a sixth head coach since the start of the 2021 season.

The day after the end of the regular season has become known as 'Black Monday' as NFL teams look to reset and make major coaching changes for the new campaign.

The Browns were the first to act, dismissing two-time coach of the year Stefanski, 43, after finishing the 2025 season with a disappointing 5-12 record. 

Stefanski joined the Browns in 2020 and led them to two play-off appearances, including a first post-season win in 26 years during his debut season.

Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam called Stefanski "a good football coach and an even better person" but said "a change at the head coaching position is necessary".

Gannon, 42, was relieved of his duties after the Cardinals lost their final nine games to end up 3-14.

He was appointed after impressing as defensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles but the Cardinals' defence never ranked inside the NFL's top 20 during his three years in charge.

Gannon's win-loss record with the Cardinals was 15-36 .

Four NFL head coaches have now been fired since the season ended on Sunday.

Atlanta Falcons were the first to act, dismissing Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot on Sunday night.

The Falcons went back-to-back seasons with an 8-9 record under Morris, who joined in 2024, and failed to reach the play-offs during Fontenot's five-year stint.

Let's dive into the details: Labubu dolls made up 90% of the £3.5m worth of fake toys seized at the UK border so far this year, according to Home Office data.

Labubu is a quirky monster character created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, and popularised through a collaboration with toy store Pop Mart.

Although they are mainly marketed as adult collectibles and fashion accessories, with some even stating they're only suitable for those over 15 on the box, they're very popular with young people and children.

But nearly three in four seized toys failed safety tests, with the "dangerous fakes" being found with harmful chemicals or choking hazards according to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO).

A new campaign from the IPO called Fake Toys, Real Harms is aiming to highlight the dangers of buying counterfeit items.

The IPO found seven in ten fake toy buyers are motivated by cost, and just 27% cited safety as a purchase consideration.

Rare editions of real Labubus can can sell for hundreds of pounds on resale sites.

Demand for the limited toys became so great that Pop Mart paused sales in all its 16 UK shops in May following reports of customers fighting over them. The toys are now sold through an online lottery system.

Of the 259,000 fake toys seized by the IPO in 2025, 236,000 were counterfeit Labubus.

Nearly half of people who purchased fake toys reported problems, the government body also found.

Issues range from toys breaking almost instantly to unsafe labelling, toxic smells and even reports of illness in children.

The IPO's deputy director of enforcement, Helen Barnham said: "These products have bypassed every safety check the law requires, which is why we're working with our partners to keep these dangerous fakes out of UK homes."

She added: "Child safety must come first, so we're urging parents – please don't let your child be the tester."

The IPO stressed that experts are warning the Labubu trend "is just the tip of the iceberg."

It warned that counterfeiting criminals target a wide range of popular toys and it's important to be vigilant and aware of what you are purchasing.

Arsenal celebrate Women's Champions League win with trophy and fans

"All I kept saying was, 'do you believe in magic?'."

Standing in front of 10,000 Arsenal fans outside Emirates Stadium on Monday, childhood fan Leah Williamson took to the microphone with a Champions League winners medal around her neck.

Stina Blackstenius scored the only goal as Renee Slegers' side stunned European giants Barcelona to win their first European title in 18 years.

Arsenal may have been the underdogs heading into Saturday's final against a Barca side chasing a third successive Champions League title, but Williamson always believed.

"I've been saying the whole time, all my team-mates will tell you all I kept saying was 'do you believe in magic?'," she said. "That's what I could feel.

"I knew it was going to happen against Lyon, I knew it was going to happen in the final. And magic delivered."

Williamson joined Arsenal at the age of eight and was mascot when Arsenal last won the competition in 2007.

Interviewed on stage by her close friend and scorer of Arsenal's 2007 Champions League-winning goal, Alex Scott, the 28-year-old had a lump in her throat as she addressed the crowd.

"We knew it was going to be a special day but when we all walked out today we said 'this is one of those moments'. This is one of the moments I'll tell my grandkids about.

"I have been educated my whole life and seen with my own two eyes how successful Arsenal have been, especially Arsenal women. All I ever wanted to do was be a part of it. It's very special.

"My club. My Arsenal. Champions League winners. European champions."

Club dog Win has been at Arsenal since 2023

There were grey skies over north London on Monday, but the sea of red and white as fans packed out Armoury Square in their thousands was a sight to behold.

The celebrations were limited to a 10,000 capacity for safety reasons but fans turned out in their droves, some of which arrived as early at 06:00 BST to ensure they secured their spot.

Arsenal's club dog Win - brought to the club by men's boss Mikel Arteta to develop the family atmosphere - was front and centre as Beth Mead held him during the event.

Left-back Katie McCabe was living her best life as she took to the microphone to lead the karaoke, with Sweet Caroline, Freed From Desire and Simply the Best among the songs belted out by players and fans alike.

"I've been with these girls for nearly 10 years," McCabe said when addressing the crowd. "Red is in my blood.

"These group of girls is everything you need in a team and that is why we did it on Saturday night in Lisbon."

Arsenal remain the only English club to win the Women's Champions League and now avoid going through the qualification rounds for next season's competition, going straight into the group phase as holders.

The Gunners' triumph in Lisbon is even more remarkable given their turbulent start to the season. They won only on of their opening four league games and lost the first leg of their first round Champions League qualifying match.

Boss Jonas Eidevall resigned in October, with Slegers appointed as interim to steady the ship, before being given the job on a permanent basis in January.

Slegers had never managed beyond the group stages of the Champions League this season, and her achievements are still sinking in.

"There were so many emotions after the game," the Dutchwoman told the crowd. "I thought when I came home I would be taking it in, but I ordered food and fell asleep.

"If you are together and you stay together whatever happens and you want to become better every day, with the foundation of being really good players you can reach high levels and that's what we have done."

Before Arsenal players lifted the trophy and were showered in red and white confetti, the last word went to the matchwinner and history-maker Blackstenius.

"It's just amazing standing here with this team and all of you," she said. "We won the Champions League and it feels unbelievable in every way."

Leah Williamson and captain Kim Little lifted the trophy to cap off a special day of celebrations for Arsenal in north London.

According to new developments, A factory in China which has been accused of making "childlike" sex dolls has been placed under investigation by the local authorities and told to immediately halt production.

The customisable dolls were reportedly being sold on major online shopping sites and social media platforms.

Chinese state-owned news outlet The Paper said that local officials were attaching "great importance" to the issue.

Last month, online retailer Shein - which started in China but is now headquartered in Singapore - banned the sale of all sex dolls globally after a public outcry over it selling dolls with a childlike appearance.

The company said at the time it had "strengthened its keyword blacklist to further prevent attempted circumvention of product listing restrictions by sellers".

Other e-commerce sites have also faced criticism over the sale of sex dolls which have childlike features. 

AliExpress has been investigated by French authorities over the issue.

Reuters reported in November that the China-based company had banned a seller which sold sex dolls, after it "repeatedly denied ever selling sex toys on any platform", AliExpress said.

Sweden has also vowed to take action against online retailers selling these types of dolls. 

"I now start from the principle that electronic commerce companies assume their responsibilities and do everything possible to end the marketing of sexual dolls that resemble children," Social Services Minister Camilla Waltersson Gronvall told AFP.

"If we see that this evolution does not happen, or is not enough, the government will not hesitate to legislate different means."

Advances in artificial intelligence have allowed for easier customisation of sex dolls ordered online, and some even have the ability to hold a conversation.

The Paper reported that the factory which is now under investigation was one of several in southern Guangdong province which were producing customisable dolls with "childlike pornography characteristics".

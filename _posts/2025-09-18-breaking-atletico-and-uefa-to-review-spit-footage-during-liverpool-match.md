Are late winners a problem or perfection for Liverpool?

Atletico Madrid will launch an investigation into the mass confrontation that marred their 3-2 Champions League loss at Anfield, with a member of their backroom team appearing to spit into the crowd.

Atletico head coach Diego Simeone was shown a red card following a heated altercation with a supporter at Anfield that resulted in a melee close to the away bench.

Subsequent video footage appears to show a member of Simeone's team spitting into the crowd during the incident, which took place after Virgil van Dijk's late winner.

European football's governing body Uefa could also take disciplinary action once it has examined all relevant official reports.

Atletico have told BBC Sport they will also conduct an investigation into the incident but will not comment publicly.

Liverpool will provide any relevant CCTV footage and other information to support a potential Uefa probe.

Simeone had to be physically restrained from confronting a fan who was shouting at him.

After the game, the Argentine coach said: "It's never very good when we react as managers, is it? But if there are comments against racism or insults, we can get angry and fight back as well, managers.

"When they scored the third goal, he [the supporter] turned around and insulted me. When I turned around, I am a person and I'm human."

When asked for specifics on the insults, Simone added: "I'm not going to get into the exact nature of the insults.

"I don't want to get involved with that. I have got to stay in my place. I know what went on behind the manager's bench.

"I can't solve society's problems in one press conference. I've got to live with it because it exists all over the place."

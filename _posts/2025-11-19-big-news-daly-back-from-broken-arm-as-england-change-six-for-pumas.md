Here’s what you need to know: Daly's last England appearance was in their win over Wales in the final match of the  Six Nations 

Quilter Nations Series: England v Argentina

Venue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham Date: Sunday 23 November Kick-off: 16:10 GMT

Coverage: Live on BBC Sounds and Radio 5 Sports Extra with live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app

Elliot Daly will play for the first time since breaking his arm on British & Irish Lions duty in June as he starts on the wing for England against Argentina on Sunday.

The 33-year-old replaces Tom Roebuck, who suffered a foot injury in last weekend's 33-19 win over New Zealand.

"He has been chomping at the bit for a few weeks," said head coach Steve Borthwick of Daly on Rugby Union Weekly

"He has been desperate to get going. He was given the OK last week, he was available for selection, but I felt that his return to contact needed that little bit longer.

"He is good to go this week. The nature of his injury means he has been able to do plenty of running, so he looks in fantastic condition. He ran a speed time last week that was at, or very very close to, to his fastest speed ever."

Daly's inclusion is one of six changes to the starting XV as Borthwick, whose hand is partly forced by injury, experiments with more combinations.

Henry Slade is at outside centre with Ollie Lawrence ruled out with a hamstring problem.

Elsewhere, there is an all-new front row with Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie recalled alongside Asher Opoku-Fordjour, who makes only his second Test start.

Ben Spencer starts at scrum-half, while Theo Dan is named on the bench with Saracens team-mate Jamie George ruled out with hamstring trouble.

Marcus Smith is on the bench once more, with full-back Freddie Steward showing no signs of concussion after a head knock against the All Blacks, and fly-half George Ford, who scored 13 points last weekend, retained.

England: Steward; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Dingwall, Daly; Ford, Spencer; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Opoku-Fordjour, Itoje, Coles, Pepper, Underhill, Earl.

Replacements: Dan, Baxter, Stuart, Ewels, T Curry, Pollock, Mitchell, M Smith.

England are chasing an 11th successive victory to round off a hugely encouraging 2025 in style.

Argentina are aiming to complete a hat-trick of wins on their northern hemisphere tour, having thrashed Wales 52-28 and fought back to overcome Scotland 33-24 last weekend.

They will have to buck historical trends to do so, having won only five of the 29 previous Test meetings. However, the Pumas were victorious on their last visit to Twickenham, edging a 2022 contest by a single point.

Daly initially attempted to play through his arm injury on the Lions tour, only to be ruled out with a significant break

Daly had impressed in the early stages of the Lions' tour to Australia this summer and, with Ireland rival Hugo Keenan struggling with sickness, had staked his claim as a possible starting Test full-back.

However an innocuous collision with Queensland Reds' Jock Campbell in the team's second tour match, left Daly's right forearm with a fracture running the length of the bone.

"I could feel that it was all wobbly and clicking," he told the Times of his short-lived attempt to play on. , external

Daly required 16 screws and a metal plate to be inserted to fix the injury and, although he has yet to make his comeback for Saracens, he has been part of England's training camp this autumn.

His ability to fill in at centre is a useful asset as the side continues with Marcus Smith, who covers fly-half and full-back, as the only backline specialist on the bench, while Daly's long-range goal-kicking is also a weapon.

"Watching the team grow, I just want to try and add to it as much as possible," said Daly. 

"The performance on Saturday was outstanding and the performances over the last three games has been brilliant.

"I am raring to go and can't wait."

BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones:

Steve Borthwick is managing to both win matches and build depth at the moment; a perfect position for an international head coach to be in, especially halfway through a Rugby World Cup cycle.

Elliot Daly's return to fitness is most welcome as it gives England another ball-playing option in the back three, while it's a big afternoon for Henry Slade, who gets a chance for the first time this month and will be keen to prove he remains a key part of the midfield picture.

After an excellent six months, George Ford has now edged ahead of Fin and Marcus Smith in the fly-half pecking order, while Ben Spencer's start at scrum-half means Alex Mitchell drops to a bench which includes five British and Irish Lions.

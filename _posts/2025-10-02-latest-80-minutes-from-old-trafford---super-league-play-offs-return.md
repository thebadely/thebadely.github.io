Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Wigan Warriors and Hull KR contested last year's Grand Final and both are in the mix again - but will Leigh Leopards and St Helens muscle their way in this year?

And then there were four.

Super League braces itself for the play-off semi-finals with four teams remaining, all tussling for their spot in next week's Grand Final at Old Trafford.

It has been a week of controversy after last week's eliminators, with a try-that-shouldn't-have-been-a-try and a row over ticketing dominating the agenda.

With so much on the line, what do we have to look forward to when Leigh make the short trip to Wigan Warriors on Friday as well as in league leaders Hull KR's meeting with St Helens?

BBC Sport takes a look at what's at stake.

Warriors come into Friday's all-Wigan borough derby play-off semi-final against Leigh after a week off, having finished second and one place above the Leopards at the end of the regular season.

It is a game which could bookend either side's season, with Leigh winning 0-1 in a stunning season opener in February, where Gareth O'Brien scored a golden-point drop-goal to give his side victory in a historic low-scoring game at the Brick Community Stadium.

Leigh come into the game off the back of an impressive season and having comprehensively beaten Wakefield in their home eliminator last week.

Wigan boss Matt Peet, who masterminded their quadruple-winning 2024 season, says he does not have any problem with motivating his players to succeed despite their formidable recent record which includes two successive Grand Final wins.

"It's on them, it's the players, I can't manufacture that," he told BBC Radio Manchester.

"They're just a determined bunch and group of lads. Every coach will be feeling the exact same this time of year. You'd be amazed if every team didn't come in hungry and motivated.

"You don't get to this stage of the season unless that's a characteristic."

Wigan v Leigh semi-final in doubt over ticket issues

Leigh 'preparing as normal' for Wigan semi - owner

Wigan's one-point defeat by Leigh at the start of the campaign was followed by another loss to their near neighbours away from home in July.

Cherry and Whites captain Liam Farrell said Wigan have taken a lot from those two defeats, having also beaten them at home in a close encounter in May.

"The 1-0, we took a lot out of that game and I thought we were conservative in that game," he told BBC Radio Manchester.

"A lot of that comes down to it being the first game of the year and probably not wanting to overplay in the conditions.

"The second one, we needed to be better and Leigh probably deserved it on the night. We probably gave them a little bit too much field position in the back end of the second half and the penalties and errors cost us. There's a few things we'll take out of that game."

Friday's play-off has been somewhat overshadowed by a ticketing issue, with Leigh reportedly informing Wigan they "do not intend to fulfil" the fixture.

Despite this, both sides have claimed they are preparing as normal for the tie.

For his part, Peet is looking forward to a close battle with their rivals and understands what the fixture means.

"It's always been a special fixture and it's always had a rivalry that's based on the geography of the two teams," he added.

"But when we're meeting each other in semi-finals and highlight games of the season, it just adds to it."

Leigh ease past Wakefield to reach semi-finals

Leigh boss Adrian Lam has led his side to six consecutive wins, including last week's eliminator victory over Wakefield.

The Leopards have never played in the Grand Final but will add their name to an exclusive list of teams to have reached Old Trafford should they beat Wigan in their own backyard.

Lam has enjoyed the 2025 campaign and told BBC Radio Manchester he is not ready for it to end.

"I'm not ready to not be coaching next week - I understand the processes involved but what we see it as is an opportunity for this current group on this journey," he said.

"It's been nice to see us tick some boxes along the way this season, as we have done every year, and finishing higher up the ladder certainly shows the trajectory we're on as a club.

"The more of these games we play, the better we're going to be. To think that we're going to be 80 minutes away from Old Trafford two years in a row as the Leigh Leopards is an incredible story."

Lam has guided Leigh to play-off campaigns in each of their three seasons in Super League after winning promotion from the Championship in 2022.

"We want to achieve things we've never done before as a club and winning our first home eliminator last week was one of those, having a home tie was one of those and we've got to do things we've never done to get what we deserve," he added.

"We know we've got to play better than we have done all year. We know it's going to take an almighty effort to beat Wigan at Wigan and we know that not too many people are going to give us a chance.

"We will do what we need to do to be there or thereabouts when the game counts most and fingers crossed a little bit of luck goes our way and we get the result we deserve."

St Helens save season with last gasp-try

Nine years ago, Hull KR were relegated from Super League having lost a nail-biting 'Million Pound Game' to Salford Red Devils courtesy of Gareth O'Brien's golden-point drop-goal.

Now, they are on the cusp of a historic treble, having already wrapped up the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield this term.

Despite their relative success, boss Willie Peters is not expecting St Helens to roll over in Saturday's semi-final.

"It's a semi-final so we need to make sure we're happy to win the game in the last second, that's the important part," Peters told BBC Radio Humberside.

"When you're playing in big games, it's not about trying to win the game in the first 10 minutes, it's not how semi-finals are aligned.

"You've got to build games and be happy and prepared to win, similar to what we did in the Challenge Cup and that's how we prepare for big games."

As for whether this season's honours have taken the pressure off somewhat, Peters does not agree.

"That's in the past," he added. "We're just focusing on this weekend. That's the most important game for us now. We've achieved that and we'll have the time to reflect on that at the right time after the season.

"When you talk about pressure, any semi-final has pressure no matter who's playing in it or who's favourite - because if you lose, you're out."

RFL apologises to Leeds over St Helens try

Left to Wright - how does crazy Saints finish rank?

St Helens travel to Hull KR having spent most of the latter stages of their play-off eliminator at Leeds Rhinos believing they would not reach the semi-finals.

Paul Wellens' side caused a huge upset when, after the hooter had sounded for full-time, they kept the ball alive and fed the ball to Shane Wright after a whopping 16 passes for him to score the try to send them through.

Wellens told BBC Radio Merseyside their experience at Headingley last week had made his side dare to dream when they travel to Craven Park.

"It's given us a lot of belief going into this game, although we're under no illusions over how tough the game is going to be," he said.

"Hull KR have been the benchmark team throughout most of the year, both with and without the ball.

"It's a difficult place to go and play, it's a very hostile atmosphere. We've got to view that very differently. It's a great challenge for us and a wonderful opportunity.

"We've been boosted by a fantastic win in great circumstances at the weekend and that gives a lot of belief going into the game."

St Helens have received criticism for not being able to see out games against the leading teams this term, but Wellens points to last weekend's game against Leeds and their regular season win against Rhinos in July, as examples of where they have overcome real quality.

He added: "I think externally there's a lot of opinions about us but internally we don't share the same feelings that people outside of this environment do.

"I consider going to Leeds and winning a play-off and going there a few weeks earlier as winning big games.

"Certain opposition have had our number in recent history which I'll accept. But we have that belief going into Hull KR at the weekend."

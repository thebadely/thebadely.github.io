According to new developments, TJ Watt has made 53 tackles, seven of them quarterback sack, this season

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker TJ Watt has had surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung sustained during dry needle treatment.

Watt, the 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, made six tackles in Pittsburgh's victory over Baltimore Ravens last Sunday. 

But the 31-year-old was taken to hospital for a lung evaluation after feeling discomfort on Wednesday.

Dry needling is a treatment for pain and movement issues involving the insertion of tiny needles into the body.

The Steelers made no reference to dry needling in an update on Friday but that element was revealed in a post on X, external by his older brother JJ.

"Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility," said JJ Watt, who is a minority investor in Premier League side Burnley.

"Recovery timeline is still TBD [to be determined], but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes."

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said TJ Watt, who signed a three-year contract extension in July, will miss Monday's game against Miami and is at "home and resting comfortably" but does not know when he will be back.

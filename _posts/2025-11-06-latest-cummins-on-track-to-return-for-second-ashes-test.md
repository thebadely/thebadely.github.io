Here’s what you need to know: Pat Cummins was appointed Australia captain on the eve of the last Ashes series in Australia, in 2021-22

Australia captain Pat Cummins says he is "on track" to play in the second Test of the Ashes series against England.

The pace bowler has not played since the end of a Test series in the West Indies in July and will miss the first Test, which starts in Perth on 21 November, with a lower back injury.

However, the 32-year-old has returned to bowling from a reduced run-up in his recovery and has targeted being back for the second Ashes Test, which is a day-night match starting in Brisbane on 4 December.

"It's all feeling really good. On track and yeah, probably better than I expected," said Cummins.

"Each session is incremental. Once I get over to Perth, I should be pretty close to a full run-up and getting some overs in."

Batter Steve Smith, who was stripped of the captaincy in 2018 following a ball-tampering scandal, will replace Cummins as skipper for the first Test of five against an England side who have not won a series down under since 2010-2011.

Cummins took 18 wickets when his side drew 2-2 in England to retain the Ashes in 2023 and, overall, he has taken 91 wickets against England in 19 Tests at an average of 24.10.

Mitchell Starc, 35, Josh Hazlewood, 34, and Scott Boland, 36, are expected to form Australia's pace attack in Perth.

"It's probably not until you get a bit closer that you can really know where you're at," said Cummins on his recovery. "The good thing is that I'm pulling up well and the body is great.

"We're trying to keep that second Test as a live option. I'll have a really good bowl in Perth, and by then I'll know where I'm at."

Cummins was guarded on how much he might play in the Ashes following a possible return in the second Test, as he said it depended on his workload.   

"I don't really want to commit to anything this far out," he added. "I'm pretty keen to play as much as I can.

"But realistically, if we have a big game and bowl 40 or 50 overs and then there's a game that starts a few days later, it might be a bridge too far.

"I'm trying to get right, and if I get right then hopefully I'll try to play as much of it as I can."

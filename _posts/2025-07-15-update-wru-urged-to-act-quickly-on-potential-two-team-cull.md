Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Chris Horsman has coached Wales Under-20s and Wales Women

Former Wales prop Chris Horsman says strong leadership and a quick decision is needed by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) after it announced it was considering cutting up to two of its four professional regional teams.

Welsh rugby's governing body says it is entering a formal consultation with the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) - which represents both the WRU and Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - saying the current system is failing and unsustainable.

The WRU says it wants a "more radical" strategy to be completed by October.

Horsman played for Celtic Warriors - one of the original five teams created when Wales switched from club to regional sides as the top level of the domestic game - who were disbanded after just one season in 2004.

"What the game needs more than anything at the moment is stability," said Horsman, 47, who won 14 caps and has coached Wales Under-20s and Wales Women.

"For me, if they're [the WRU] going to make the cut they've got to just come forward they've got to give us some strong leadership."

The current professional rugby agreement (PRA) that underpins the Welsh professional game runs out in 2027.

It was due to be superseded by a new five-year deal agreed by WRU-owned Cardiff and privately-owned Dragons, but has still not been signed by either Ospreys or Scarlets who say "key issues" have not been resolved.

The four sides are expected to continue to exist in their current form until at least June 2027 but their futures are now uncertain.

"Potentially they have got a year left of their contract," Horsman told Radio Wales Drive.

"They [the regions] want financial stability. Are you going to buy a season ticket? If you're a business are you going to sponsor the region, because you don't know in three, four month's time, you might be told it's not going to be there anymore? 

"So there are so many things resting on this decision and again we've got to wait.

"I know it's not going to be straightforward but we've heard that things were going to happen 18 months ago and they haven't, so I don't put a lot of stock in it's going to happen fast. I hope it does for the players' sake and for Welsh rugby's sake.

"One thing I will say is when we were at the Celtic Warriors, it happened over a weekend, pretty much, and as painful as it was at least it was done and then there was a decision made that the players were divvied up, pretty equally between the four regions and the game moved on quickly. 

"I think that's what's needed now."

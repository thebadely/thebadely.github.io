Here’s what you need to know: There's one big call in this FPL team of the week and that is to go with no Manchester City players - and yes that includes Erling Haaland!

The budget is needed to go all-in on Arsenal players as they host one of the worst teams in Premier League history.

Yes, City smashed in five goals on their last away trip but this time they take on Crystal Palace, who have the second-best defence in the league for goals conceded and fourth-best in terms of expected goals conceded.

And Arsenal home to Wolves is the kind of match-up you just have to attack - the best team in the league against one devoid of form, quality and confidence.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Finally, some expert advice

No captain return but big scores from Bruno Fernandes (18), Ruben Dias (14), Phil Foden (12) and James Tarkowski (9), plus a lucky 16-point Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall substitute appearance led to a monster 83 points. Boom!

Robin Roefs, Sunderland, keeper, Â£4.7m - Newcastle (h)

The first Tyne-Wear derby in the Premier League since 2016 is going to be loud, passionate, feisty - and it could be one of those games that is all drama but little goalmouth action.

Which would make Roefs, third in the goalkeeper scoring charts, a decent shout.

Ben White, Arsenal, Â£5.2m - Wolves (h)

An Arsenal defender is a must this week. Wolves have one goal on the road this season and one in their past six matches.

White is a fantastic attacking option when he gets his chance. He started the past two at right-back, had a 14-point haul against Brentford and leads the way in that time among Arsenal defenders with two big chances created, two shots in the box and an expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.7.

Marc Cucurella, Chelsea, Â£6.2m - Everton (h)

Everton are unpredictable so this pick is more about Chelsea's defence and Cucurella's potential.

Chelsea have the fourth-best defence while Cucurella has created more chances (19) than any other defender in the league.

And he hasn't scored yet, having netted five times last season.

Diogo Dalot, Manchester United, Â£4.4m - Bournemouth (h)

You can't have high hopes for a United clean sheet - they have one all season - but Bournemouth's goals have dried up in the past two games.

More importantly, Dalot has been getting in some incredibly attacking positions as left wing-back in the past three games.

In those matches he's had four shots, two big chances, a goal and an assist. He missed a cracking chance at Wolves on Monday too.

If Cole Palmer gets back to top form, he could be a key factor in the second half of the FPL season

Bukayo Saka (captain), Arsenal, Â£10.2m - Wolves (h)

This game against Wolves is too juicy to pass up and that makes Saka, Arsenal's best  attacking player essential.

No stats needed to back this up. Manchester United had 27 shots at Wolves on Monday, scored four and could have had double that.

Arsenal will be licking their lips.

Declan Rice, Arsenal, Â£7.1m - Wolves (h)

One point behind Bruno Fernandes in the midfield scoring list, Rice is so consistent for Arsenal.

More attacking this season, he's created more chances than any Arsenal player (27) and has five assists to show for it.

He's also the most reliable for minutes as Mikel Arteta could see this as a chance to rotate his squad.

Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, Â£9m - Bournemouth (h)

Fernandes might have replaced Antoine Semenyo as the essential FPL midfielder.

Match-up proof, always a shout for defensive contribution points (defcon) and with mulitiple routes to points.

Cole Palmer, Chelsea, Â£10.3m - Everton (h)

This week's punt, Palmer has his first 90 minutes under his belt after a long injury and we know what an explosive FPL asset he can be.

You get the feeling that, as soon as he has one good game, FPL managers will be flocking to sign him up.

He missed Chelsea's Champions League defeat at Atalanta, but that was the club managing his minutes so he should be fresh for Everton.

Dango Ouattara, Brentford, Â£6m - Leeds (h)

Leeds come into this game off the back of two great home results against Chelsea and Liverpool, but on the road they have conceded three goals for every one they've scored.

This is likely Ouattara's final match before heading to the Africa Cup of Nations.

He's been superb for Brentford this season, and has five attacking returns in his past three home matches.

Igor Thiago, Brentford, Â£6.9m - Leeds (h)

It's been a frustrating couple of weeks for Thiago owners, with just three points in two games.

However, he's the second top scorer in the league and has seven goals in seven home games. He's the best striker choice this week and, with a favourable fixture list, you can set and forget until the end of January at least.

Hugo Ekitike, Liverpool, Â£8.4m - Brighton (h)

Surely Arne Slot keeps faith with the young Frenchman, after his two-goal haul at Leeds.

He was great at the start of the season and you wonder what he would have done had Alexander Isak not arrived and challenged him for minutes at centre-forward.

Martin Dubravka, Burnley, Â£4m - Fulham (h)

Nathan Collins, Brentford, Â£4.9m - Leeds (h)

Zian Flemming - Burnley, Â£5.3m - Fulham (h)

Maxime Esteve, Burnley, Â£3.9m - Fulham (h)

Team total cost: Â£96.7m

Experts revealed that Livingston striker Jeremy Bokila was sent off at Pittodrie

Livingston will contact the Scottish FA to report Aberdeen over an alleged racial comment made to striker Jeremy Bokila.

Following Livingston's 6-2 defeat by Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Saturday, manager David Martindale said 37-year-old Bokila was in tears in the changing room after a comment made to him on the pitch.

It is understood the alleged comment was of a racial nature and came amid a second-half melee that resulted in Bokila being sent off.

After the match, Martindale said: "I've got a 37-year-old striker in there crying, so I'll need to go and try and get to the bottom of that one."

In a statement, Aberdeen say: "The club is aware of an allegation that racist language was used during today's match with Livingston FC at Pittodrie.

"The player concerned has been informed of the allegation and vehemently denies it.

"Aberdeen FC condemns any and all forms of discrimination and we will co-operate fully with all relevant authorities during any investigation.

"While this process is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further."

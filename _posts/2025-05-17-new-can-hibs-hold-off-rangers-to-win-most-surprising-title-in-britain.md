Experts revealed that Hibernian need just a point to win a first SWPL title since 2007

SWPL finale: Rangers v Hibernian

Where: Ibrox Stadium When: Sunday 18 May Time: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Watch live on the BBC Sport website, app & iPlayer, listen on BBC Sounds & BBC Radio Scotland

If Hibernian get the draw they need against Rangers on Sunday to clinch the Scottish Women's Premier League crown, it would arguably be the most surprising title win in Britain this season.

Nobody predicted Grant Scott's side would be in this position before a ball was kicked in August - needing just a draw at Ibrox to become champions for the first time since 2007 and first in the professional era.

Last term, Hibs were fifth, a huge 36 points behind eventual winners Celtic, and Rangers, who lost out on goal difference.

But this season, up against better-funded Glasgow sides with more winning and international experience, Hibs have been the most consistent team over 31 games and surprised everyone with their relentlessness.

Game 32, though, is where it is all on the line. Treble-chasing Rangers are three points behind and the only side who can stop Hibs, and in turn claim the title themselves - on goal difference - with a victory.

For the third season in a row the SWPL will be decided on the final day, and if this campaign is anything like the last two the tension it will go right to stoppage time.

As Rangers head coach Jo Potter said: "It's looking tasty".

'Underdogs' v treble hunters as SWPL reaches thrilling finale

After Hibs' 4-2 victory over Celtic on Wednesday, defender Siobhan Hunter - a one-club woman who has supported Hibs all her life - went over to the touchline.

The cameras captured her fist-pumping and roaring and urging the small band of supporters at Meadowbank to turn up the noise to celebrate getting to the final day with a three-point lead.

That passion and togetherness has been a mark of Hibs' season, as was the fact Caley Gibb, Michaela McAlonie and were like the walking wounded in the closing stages of that huge victory, before eventually being hauled from the field.

Tegan Bowie was named as a substitute despite her foot being in a protective boot.

Scott - who had cup success during his first spell at Hibs from 2018 to 2019 - has added to a squad of academy graduates players from around the SWPL who have shone at other clubs and built a strong unit.

Chief among them is Kathleen McGovern, who has scored a remarkable 31 goals in all competitions since her summer move from Hearts and been rewarded with a maiden Scotland call up.

She has been ably supported by academy graduate Eilidh Adams, who has 27 for the campaign. The pair have scored 49 of Hibs' 89 goals in the league.

At the other end, they have conceded the second-fewest goals, which has contributed to their excellent record against the other five professional teams in the league.

Hibs have taken 28 points from a possible 45 so far against Rangers, Glasgow City, Celtic, and Hearts. That's five more than Rangers have achieved.

But after all that work, taking the final step could be the hardest one of all.

Hibs have beaten Rangers twice already in the league this season, while the third meeting was a draw.

However, Rangers steamrolled Hibs in the second half of the Sky Sports Cup final in March, winning 5-0.

The obvious difference that day was the game was played at Fir Park, on a big grass pitch, whereas the league meetings were all on artificial surfaces, as nearly every game is in the SWPL.

Rangers have decided to play this final game at Ibrox, to try to use their own fans but also the wide Ibrox surface to their advantage.

Both Potter and Scott have said it will allow Rangers to stretch the game more and get their considerable attacking weapons into the game.

That has been their strength this season, having scored an astonishing 139 goals in 31 games - by far the most in the league - as they have swatted aside the division's inferior teams.

Katie Wilkinson has 39 alone in the league, as many as four SWPL sides as a whole. 

So can Rangers use the pitch to maximise space for their potent forwards? It is not always as simple as that.

The last time they played at Ibrox, Potter says they "let themselves down" as they were beaten 1-0 by Glasgow City on 30 April.

Two seasons ago they were also beaten 1-0 by City when they had the chance to win the title on the final day at Ibrox.

Ultimately, it is about handling the pressure. Who can step up and deliver when everything is on the line?

Should Glasgow City defeat Hearts in their last game, whoever does not win the league between Rangers and Hibs will drop to third - and miss out on going into the Champions League qualifiers.

Rangers would at least have the consolation of a Scottish Cup final next week, but the league is the big target and their hopes of a first ever Treble are at stake.

It really is all or nothing. Tasty indeed.

It has been recently reported that Last season's beaten Scottish Cup finalists Celtic have been drawn away to sixth-tier Auchinleck Talbot in the fourth round of this year's competition, while defending champions Aberdeen will start their defence at home against Championship side Raith Rovers.

Jimmy Thelin's side beat Celtic on penalties at Hampden in May to win the cup for the first time since 1990.

Auchinleck - who are second in the West of Scotland League Premier Division - beat League 2 Dumbarton 4-0 to reach the fourth round and they now welcome 42-time Scottish Cup winners Celtic to Beechwood Park, which holds 4,000 people.

Rangers host League 2 Annan Athletic, while there are three all-Premiership ties.

Kilmarnock take on Dundee, Livingston face St Mirren and league-leaders Hearts welcome Falkirk to Tynecastle.

Hibernian are away to Dunfermline, Dundee United host Ayr United, while Motherwell host Ross County.

All fourth round ties will be played over the weekend of 17-18 January 2026.

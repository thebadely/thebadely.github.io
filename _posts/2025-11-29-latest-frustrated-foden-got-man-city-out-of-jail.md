Foden stars in Man City win over Leeds United

Former Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart said midfielder Phil Foden "stepped up" for Pep Guardiola's side after his double secured a 3-2 win over Leeds.

The 25-year-old scored the first of his two goals just 59 seconds into the game - the earliest league goal for City at Etihad Stadium since David Silva's strike after 52 seconds against Watford in September 2019. 

And, after Leeds scored twice in the second half to shock Pep Guardiola's side and draw level, Foden struck in the 91st minute to seal the victory that helped his side keep pace with leaders Arsenal, who are now four points ahead. 

"He got them out of jail, but he got them out of jail with absolute quality," Hart told Match of the Day.

"He was absolutely purring, he stepped up for Manchester City."

Foden said he wanted "to prove to myself that I can still score goals" after a run of five games without a netting.

"I was so hungry to play today, not to prove to anyone else but to prove to myself that I can still score goals," Foden told Sky Sports after the victory. 

"I've been a bit frustrated and it was in the back of my mind to put it right and I was delighted to put two away today." 

Before Saturday, the England international had scored just once this Premier League season - in the 3-0 derby win against Manchester United on 14 September. 

Foden's most productive season at City came in 2023-24 when he had 19 goals before scoring seven last season - six of them coming in four games at the start of 2025.

However, he struck twice in the 4-1 home win against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League earlier this month before keeping his purple patch going against Leeds in a match that saw momentum swing multiple times. 

"Right up there with one of the wildest games," Foden summed up the action. 

"We were in full control. They changed it around in the second half, changed the system and we couldn't seem to get going. 

"It was a frustrating half but when we had a short break, the manager got us together to adapt to their formation and we started playing again. 

"We put on the pressure and I finally managed to find a bit of space and get my shot off and find the bottom of the net. Really happy with it but there are still things we can improve."

City, who were beaten at Newcastle in their previous match, will hope Arsenal drop points at Chelsea on Sunday as they look to remain within touching distance of Mikel Arteta's Gunners. 

"A title race is never straightforward," Foden said. 

"There are always ups and downs and periods where you can't get going and find results. We've had that recently and I'm delighted with the courage and heart shown from the lads to keep going. The belief and togetherness came through in the end.

"Hopefully we can kick on from here now, but you never know what to expect."

Guardiola reflects on late Manchester City victory against Leeds

Foden would have done his chances of making it to England's 2026 World Cup squad no harm with another impressive display.

The City playmaker had not featured for England since March and was not selected in the three England squads before Thomas Tuchel recalled him to national team earlier this month. 

However, he only featured as a substitute in the wins against Serbia and Albania, coming on to replace captain Harry Kane and midfielder Declan Rice respectively. 

Speaking after recalling Foden, Tuchel had said: "Phil scores and assists more from the 18-yard box.

"The main thing about him is that he gets a role in the central part of the pitch. I don't see him as a winger any more. He should have a central role that will bring out his strengths most."

And Foden's display validated Tuchel's comments as he made a well-timed run into the box to score the opener before a sharp finish on the turn into the bottom corner to earn the three points. 

"It's not the first time we saw that," City manager Guardiola said. 

"Since he came up with us, he has done it thousands of times. In those terms, I know the quality. He can shoot strong. He is able to put the ball simply in the net.

"Phil has to be around the box. His finishing is so quick. I think Phil is doing a really good season." 

Former England striker Chris Sutton called Foden's second goal a "wonderful piece of individual skill" on BBC Radio 5 Live while former Chelsea and Arsenal forward Ellen White praised Foden as "phenomenal" and "outstanding".

"That was just outstanding, the way he moves," White told BBC Final Score. 

"The way he moved past three players, he glided, he used his body. His centre of gravity is just phenomenal. To whip it with his left foot into the bottom right corner. 

"It's beautiful from the right to left. The way he glides with the ball is beautiful." 

Tuchel previously stated that Kane, Foden and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham cannot start together in England's current system. 

But with more displays like that, he could force a serious rethink for the German tactician before England board the flight across the Atlantic next summer.

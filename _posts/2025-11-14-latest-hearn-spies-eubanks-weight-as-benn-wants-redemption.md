Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn face off for the last time before fight

Chris Eubank Jr vowed to put on a "fight of the decade contender" in his rematch with Conor Benn on Saturday.

The bitter rivals engaged in a final tense face-off at Friday's ceremonial weigh-in at the iconic York Hall in Bethnal Green.

Eubank looked emotionless but Benn, who said he was too fiery when he lost their first fight in April, appeared the more charged of the two.

"Everything is on track for a Chris Eubank Jr knockout win," Eubank said. 

"This is what I love to do, this is my life. I'm not excited, this is what I was bred to do. I can't wait to go out there and show the world yet again.

"The first fight was a fight of the year contender. This fight will be a fight of the decade contender."

After being the stars of the news conference on Thursday, Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn were not on stage for the weigh-in.

The boxers weighed in officially on Friday morning behind closed doors and both tipped the scales at 11st 5lb (72kg).

Despite it only being a ceremonial weigh-in, the scales were turned on and Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn said Benn weighed 11st 13lb (76kg) with Eubank two pounds lighter.

Both fighters are bound by a rehydration clause that prohibits them from weighing more than 12st 1lb (77kg) on Saturday morning.

Conor Benn lost for the first time in his career against Chris Eubank Jr in April

There has been talk of slower ticket sales for the rematch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with some suggestions that the appetite to see Eubank and Benn meet again is not quite there.

But this was the first event of fight week when the public were allowed to attend and there was standing room only with the queues around the corner to gain entry.

Eubank made one final attempt to wrest control of proceedings before fight night by making Benn wait an extra few minutes before they were announced on to the stage.

Both men received a warm welcome and plenty of cheers when they eventually emerged.

The build-up to this bout has been less dramatic than earlier in the year when Eubank slapped Benn with an egg at a news conference, and coming in overweight by 0.05lb the day before the fight.

Although the hostility remains, it appears the respect they gained for each other after a bruising contest has ensured no-one oversteps the line.

"I'm excited to get in there and do the business," Benn said. 

"It's a blessing. I'm a welterweight but I want to come in heavy. I'm not concerned about what Chris does.

"Do not miss it. Make sure you tune in. Redemption is all that matters."

Just as when Eubank and Benn fought in April, there is a rehydration clause that both must adhere to - meaning neither man can put on more than 10lb between Friday's weigh-in and Saturday morning.

Benn's team feel the rehydration clause allows for a more level playing field.

The weight disparity, with Benn jumping up two divisions for this contest, has been a hot topic in the build-up to both fights.

In April, Eubank missed the middleweight limit of 11st 6lb by 0.05lb at the weigh-in - but came in comfortably below the rehydration limit the next day.

Fighters usually shed fat over the course of their training camp to get close to the agreed or stipulated weight limit.

Prior to the weigh-in, which takes place a day before fight night, they may dehydrate to lose the final bit of weight. 

Losing water weight close to the fight allows them to refuel with food and water much more easily.

Eubank says he usually puts on about 14lb after a weigh-in.

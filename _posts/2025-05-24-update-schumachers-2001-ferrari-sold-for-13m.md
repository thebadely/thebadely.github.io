It has been recently reported that Michael Schumacher drove the F2001 in his final Monaco Grand Prix win

The Ferrari driven to victory by Formula One legend Michael Schumacher at the 2001 Monaco Grand Prix has been sold for 15.98m euros (Â£13.43m) at auction.

He also raced in the F2001 to win the Hungarian Grand Prix and clinch the fourth of his seven world titles in that year.

The car was sold by RM Sotheby's before qualifying for this year's Monaco Grand Prix and became the most expensive car driven by the German, 56, to be sold at auction.

It was also the fourth most expensive F1 car ever sold - the world record was set in February when a Mercedes 'streamliner' raced by Sir Stirling Moss and Juan Manuel Fangio went for Â£42.75m.

Previously, the most paid for a car driven by Schumacher was the Â£9.75m bid for his F2003 back in 2002.

Ferrari will hope to emulate Schumacher's 2001 success in Monte Carlo with Charles Leclerc second, behind McLaren's Lando Norris, on the grid for Sunday's race.

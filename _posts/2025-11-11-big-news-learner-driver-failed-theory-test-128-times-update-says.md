According to new developments, A learner driver has failed their theory test 128 times, according to a new report.

The candidate would have spent about £3,000, findings released by the AA Driving School and based on official statistics have shown.

Another driver passed on their 75th attempt last year, costing them an estimated £1,700.

The theory test was introduced almost 30 years ago for learner drivers, who must take it before they can book a practical driving test.

The theory test is split into two sections.

In the first part of the test, candidates have about an hour to answer 50 multiple-choice questions on the rules of the road. 

The second part focuses on spotting road hazards in video clips. 

After the theory, learners must take a practical test which examines driving ability, eyesight and vehicle safety knowledge. 

According to data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, obtained by the AA, two learners have taken their practical test 37 times without passing.

It took 43 tries for another candidate to pass, the report said, potentially costing them up to £3,200. 

A theory test costs £23, whereas a driving exam costs £62 on weekdays and £75 on weekends or bank holidays for those using a car. 

According to the data, almost 2.8m theory tests were taken in the year leading up to March 2025, with a 44.9% pass rate. 

During the same period, more than 1.8m practical tests were conducted, with a 48.7% pass rate.

The figures don't show how many of tests were repeat attempts.

Earlier this year, there was a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK, according to the AA at the time.

"Life can get in the way of the best revision, leading to extra nerves and time-pressures on the day," said Emma Bush, the managing director at AA Driving School. 

"It is also easy to underestimate the level of knowledge required to pass the theory test," she added.

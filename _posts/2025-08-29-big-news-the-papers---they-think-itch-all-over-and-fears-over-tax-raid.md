Let's dive into the details: "They think itch all over", declares Metro, as it leads on the rollout of a chickenpox vaccine on the NHS in England and Wales from January. The paper says the jab will remove the risk of children developing severe symptoms, while also preventing them from having to stay off school or nursery. The Times says the jab is the first to be added to the routine NHS schedule since 2015. The i Paper calls the rollout "long overdue" and brings England in line with countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia.

The Guardian features a photograph of the aftermath of a Russian missile strike that hit the British Council building in Kyiv. "Hit back at Vlad" is the Sun's message. Its editorial says "crippling financial sanctions" for Moscow "cannot come soon enough". The Daily Telegraph leader calls the attack "outrageous" and a "statement of outright contempt" for the ongoing peace efforts.

"Stop taxing everything", are the words of the Asda chairman on the front of the Daily Mail. Allan Leighton says Rachel Reeves' approach is "hitting the pocket" of consumers.

The Daily Mirror leads on what it calls a "royal exclusive": the King is reportedly set to meet the Duke of Sussex for the first time in 19 months. Prince Harry is in London in two weeks. A source has told the Daily Mirror that there is a "determination" on both sides to make the meeting happen.

The Sun reports that positions being advertised at an immigration removal centre include painting and hairdressing tutors, as well as someone to teach balloon craft and floristry. The paper's headline calls what has gone on "balloonacy".

"Bearded and slimmer than we have come to expect" - the Daily Mail is among those to feature pictures of Boris Johnson's new look while on holiday in Greece. The Daily Express thinks there is a "hol of a difference", while the beard gets a thumbs up from the Daily Telegraph: "Hirsutes, you, sir".

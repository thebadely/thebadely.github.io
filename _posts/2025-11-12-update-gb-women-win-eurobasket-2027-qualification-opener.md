It has been recently reported that Great Britain are in a qualifying group with Switzerland, Austria and Norway

Great Britain's women began their EuroBasket 2027 qualification attempt with a 85-64 victory over Switzerland in Manchester.

The hosts trailed 22-12 after the first quarter, before scoring 32 points in the second to lead by six at half-time.

Britain pulled away after the break to secure a dominant victory in their opening Group D match in the first round of qualifying.

Holly Winterburn hit a game-high 26 points for the hosts at the National Basketball Performance Centre.

Britain face Austria in Vienna on Saturday, before playing Norway in Bergen on Tuesday. The return legs will all take place in March.

The top two teams from each of the seven groups will advance to the second round of qualifying, alongside the three highest-ranked third-placed sides.

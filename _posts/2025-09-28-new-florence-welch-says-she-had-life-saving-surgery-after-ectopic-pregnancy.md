Experts revealed that Singer Florence Welch has revealed she underwent life-saving emergency surgery after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy in August 2023.

The Grammy nominee told the Guardian she was unknowingly suffering serious internal bleeding while performing on stage at a festival, telling the paper her pregnancy was "the closest I came to death".

She was diagnosed with a ruptured fallopian tube after suffering a miscarriage, which required surgery "within the hour".

At the time, Welch, 39, cancelled some planned concerts, telling fans she was doing so for "reasons I don't really feel strong enough to go into yet". 

She told the Guardian she was left devastated after experiencing a miscarriage but was advised by a doctor that she would be able to honour her performance schedule.

On the day of a headline show in Cornwall, Welch said she felt unwell but was able to complete her set as planned.

However, the singer said a scan shortly after revealed there was "a Coke can's worth of blood in my abdomen".

She was told she would need to immediately undergo emergency surgery to have her fallopian tube removed.

According to the NHS, one in 90 pregnancies in the UK are ectopic, and occur when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb.

Symptoms for women usually start between four and 12 weeks, and can include pain low down on one side of the abdomen and pain in the tip of the shoulder.

If undiagnosed, the fallopian tube can burst, leading to life-threatening internal bleeding. In those circumstances, immediate surgery to either repair or remove the organ is required.

Welch, who performs with Florence and the Machine, is due to release a new album, Everybody Scream, in October.

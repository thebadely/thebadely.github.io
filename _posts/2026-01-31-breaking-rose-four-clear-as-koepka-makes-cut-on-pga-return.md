England's Justin Rose shot a seven-under-par 65 to extend his lead to four shots at the Farmers Insurance Open while returning Brooks Koepka made the cut in San Diego.

The 45-year-old, who leads Ireland's Seamus Power, sits on 17 under after breaking his own 36-hole record at the tournament.

Rose shot the round of the day on Friday at the more challenging South Course with an eagle, six birdies and just one bogey.

"I feel like in my career I've won on tough golf courses generally, so that's my M.O., I would say," said 2025 Masters runner-up Rose, who led by a shot after an opening-round 62.

"It's the kind of a place I enjoy. It's one of my favourite tournaments on Tour, just the whole area, the whole atmosphere, the whole vibe."

Meanwhile, Koepka continued his return to the PGA Tour with a second-round 68 to make the cut on three under.

Five-time major winner Koepka, who agreed a release from his LIV Golf contract at the end of 2025, struggled on the South Course on Thursday, shooting a round of 73.

But on the North Course he found his form in his first PGA Tour event in four years,  sinking an eagle putt on the 17th.

"I think [Thursday] I was excited to play, nervous, and kind of didn't know what to expect, but today felt more normal, I guess," Koepka said.

"But yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely still got antsy, but I guess maybe a little bit of nerves, just trying to figure it out and test - see where my game's at too, right? I feel like I'm playing really well. It's just been a long layoff."

Xander Schauffele's streak of making consecutive cuts - the longest active on tour at 72 - came to an end, while Patrick Cantlay, Gary Woodland, Will Zalatoris, JJ Spaun, Max Homa and Ludvig Aberg also all missed the cut.

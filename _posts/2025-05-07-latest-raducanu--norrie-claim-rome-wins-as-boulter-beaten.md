Here’s what you need to know: Emma Raducanu will face Ekaterina Alexandrova in the second round in Rome, while Cameron Norrie will take on Daniil Medvedev

Britain's Emma Raducanu and Cameron Norrie won their first-round matches at the Italian Open as Katie Boulter failed to progress in Rome. 

Raducanu, making her first appearance at the tournament after a three-year absence, had to dig deep to win 7-5 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 against Australian Maya Joint. 

The British number two felt the level of the match was "really high" and said: "I'm really proud of myself as well because that was a great performance, I think, on all fronts."

Norrie booked his second-round place with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 win over Christopher O'Connell.  

Meanwhile, 28-year-old Boulter lost 3-6 3-6 to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia. 

Raducanu will face Russian second seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the next round, while Norrie will be in action on Friday, 9 May against world number 11 Daniil Medvedev - a player the Brit has faced three times but never beaten.

After taking a tight first set, Raducanu was serving for the match at 5-4 in the second when a resurgent Joint fought back and was able to take the former US Open champion to a tie-break, which the 19-year-old breezed through 7-1. 

Raducanu then had to regroup for the deciding set and raced into a 5-0 lead, only to be pegged back again by Joint who won the next three games. She finally closed out the set on serve after two hours and 44 minutes. 

During a bathroom break after the second set, Raducanu used the thought of losing the match to fuel her motivation going into the decider.

"That was pretty powerful and strong," added the 22-year-old. 

Raducanu returned to action in April after taking a month-long break from competitive tennis. She made it through to the second round at the Madrid Open two weeks ago but fell to a straight-set defeat by Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk. 

In the men's competition, British number three Norrie was defeated by Serbian Dusan Lajovic in the qualifying round on Tuesday, but he received a spot in the main draw as a lucky loser. 

The 29-year-old dropped just five games against O'Connell in a 76-minute match and told Sky Sports he channelled his anger into overcoming the Australian following his disappointing performance against Lajovic. 

"I was sharp, I didn't give him much and I played some physical tennis," said Norrie. "I was just really happy I turned that energy around."

For Boulter, after earning the first WTA clay-court win of her career last month in Madrid, she struggled to repeat the same form in Rome against Pavlyuchenkova, despite the former French Open finalist being on a four-match losing streak.

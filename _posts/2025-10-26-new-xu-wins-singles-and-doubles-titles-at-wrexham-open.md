Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Mimi Xu also won the Lexus GB Pro Series Aldershot trophy in 2024

Welsh teenager Mimi Xu secured the biggest victory of her career so far by beating Mika Stojsavljevic to win the Lexus Wrexham Open.

Xu defeated her fellow British teenager and former Junior Billie Jean King Cup team-mate 6-3 7-5 in the final.

Later in the day Xu teamed up with Ella McDonald to win the doubles title.

In the singles final, the 18-year-old from Swansea made a strong start, winning five games in a row and breaking three times to storm out to a 5-1 lead.

Stojsavljevic proved more solid on serve in the second set and the young Brit saved seven break points to stay in contention.

However, with the scores locked at 5-5, Xu managed to seal the all-important break before serving out a landmark victory on her third match point.

"It's honestly felt amazing," said Xu.

"It's been so good, the atmosphere, the crowd, the environment, I've loved every minute of it. I honestly have no words to describe how I feel at the moment."

Stojsavljevic, 16, had reached her second consecutive final after winning the Lexus GB Pro Series Birmingham a week previously and had beaten Xu in the quarter-finals on her way to winning that title.

The former US Open junior champion, had not dropped a set in reaching the Wrexham Open final.

"This is now my tenth match in a row in ten days or so, so I think physically I wasn't there 100 per cent today,"Stojsavljevic said.

"But credit to Mimi, she played really great and I'm really happy for her. It was tough for me, but she did really well."

Xu had little time to celebrate her win as she teamed up with McDonald in the doubles final against Amarni Banks and Valentina Ryser.

The British pair beat fellow British player Amarni Banks and Switzerland's Valentina Ryser to win the doubles final 6-2, 6-4.

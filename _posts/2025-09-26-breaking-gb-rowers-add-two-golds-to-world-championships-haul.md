Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dan Graham (right), 26, takes home gold at his first senior World Championships.

Great Britain won two gold medals at the 2025 World Rowing Championships in Shanghai, with victory in the men's four and PR1 men's single sculls.

Competing as a combination for the first time at this regatta, the impressive form of Daniel Graham, James Robson, Douwe de Graaf and George Bourne continued as the new-look quartet beat Romania and the Netherlands to top the men's four podium.

Benjamin Pritchard's dominance continued as the Paralympic and European champion led the PR1 single sculls field from start to finish, adding another gold to his collection. 

The awards come a day after Great Britain claimed silver in both the men's and women's quadruple sculls on the first day of the finals on Thursday.

Double silver for GB quads at World Championships

"We came here thinking we could do it, but we wanted to focus on progressing through the regatta and to get better each time we hit the water," Robson said after the race. 

"We had a great row in that final. It was quite a battle and we're just really happy to have got that over the line and get it done!"

Pritchard set a new Paralympic record at Paris 2024, before becoming a European Champion for the first time in Plovdiv earlier this year. 

Of his form, the Welshman said: "This project is an undisputed success."

"I'm a Paralympic, European and world champion. I've broken European records, Paralympic records and world championship records. I'll take it all to be honest! 

"I wanted to get off quick and hold the lead, and towards the end I was holding on for dear life. I was dying in those last five strokes, that's for sure.

"The temperature here is wild. It's genuinely like rowing in an inferno! I've done a lot of heat preparation back home in the UK with our support staff, who have been fantastic. But it just doesn't prepare you for these conditions. This is something else!"

Elsewhere, Lauren Henry is through to the women's single sculls final after winning her semi-final.

In the PR3 mixed double sculls, Sam Murray and Annie Caddick also progressed to the final with a first-place finish.

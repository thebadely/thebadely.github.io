Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says Rangers head coach Russell Martin deserves more respect and will emerge stronger from his current predicament.

Martin is under pressure after three wins in 12 games in all competitions since taking charge at Ibrox after Barry Ferguson's interim spell in charge. 

Celtic lead the Scottish Premiership with the Ibrox side in 10th, nine points back.

"I have some issues around the moral aspect when I see people commenting on how he's doing when, not that long ago, they were in his shoes or sat on the bench," said Rodgers of comments about Martin.

"I don't like that when I see a manager being pulled up on certain parts of the game, certain tactics, that not so long ago other people couldn't work that out either.

"At the big pressure clubs, it's a big challenge because all the eyes are on you. It can be a lonely place. The voices of safety are even less. 

"There's hardly any time to breathe, but you have to find a way."

Martin was criticised for taking his players wild swimming and hill walking at Loch Lomond after their latest loss, a 2-0 defeat by Hearts at Ibrox last Saturday .

But Rodgers countered: "It's timing. At another time, if Russell does that and they won a few games, everyone would be saying 'what a great idea'.

"We had a team-building exercise during the week with the players and the partners and it was really nice.

"I see the scrutiny that's on Russell and whatever happens for him, he will be better for it. He will be stronger for it."

Rodgers sees similarities between Martin's situation and his own younger days.

The Northern Irishman took charge of Liverpool in 2012 at 39 - the same age Martin is now - and can identify with the position he finds himself in.

"Unless you've been in the shoes of a manager or a coach, do you really, really understand what that person's gone through? And if you have been in that position, you should respect more. 

"He's a good man. When he played, he had a fantastic career built around will and desire and had a really good career when he stepped into management.

"He's done well with the clubs that he's been at and has now taken on an opportunity up here to try and transform Rangers. So, give him time to breathe."

According to new developments, When Chris Davies's daughter first begged him for a hamster, he wasn't exactly thrilled.

But eight-year-old Lily, after hours of research, managed to convince her dad they were not just "starter pets" and to welcome one into their home. 

The NHS nurse bought Popcorn, a hamster he said he knew there was "something different" about from the beginning.

But nothing could have prepared Chris for the "surreal" impact the rodent would have on his life, eventually leading him to the woman he will soon marry. 

Not long after bringing Popcorn home, Chris' life took an expected turn as he had a "sudden" break-up.

"I was broken after," he said. Yet during those lonely times, it was Popcorn who offered him unexpected support.

"I thought I'd just be more open-minded and see what this animal was about."

Chris was surprised to find that Popcorn behaved more like a loyal puppy than a rodent.

"He was following me like a dog," he said. "I got him on the sofa with me, and he fell asleep on my chest. I couldn't believe it."

For Chris, who struggles with anxiety, Popcorn soon became a source of calm and connection.

"It was just a really beautiful thing. It was mindfulness. 

"Being a nurse in the NHS, some days are quite hard and it's really stressful, but Popcorn would just calm me down."

Lily and other family members began encouraging Chris to post videos of Popcorn's behaviour online.

"I was kind of anxious at first," Chris said. "How many blokes do you see lying on a sofa with a hamster?"

But almost as soon as Chris began posting videos of Popcorn on TikTok, they took off. 

More than140,000 fans were charmed by Popcorn's unusual personality, his affection and his bond with Chris and Lily.

He became, as Chris lovingly described him, their "micro-dog".

What followed was a bizarre set of events no one could have been predicted, Chris said.

As Popcorn gained popularity online, Chris and Lily wrote a book together about the impact that the little critter had on their family, which was then published in May 2024.

Then one evening, Chris then received a comment from a fellow Cardiffian, Carrie, telling him his content was "cute".

The pair got chatting, soon discovering mutual passions, a shared love for animals and even the same profession.

"We were living only a mile apart, but we'd never bumped into each other," Chris said. "It was crazy."

Chris and Carrie met in person a few months later and when Carrie held Popcorn, Chris said, it was like a something "clicked into place".

The family, which has now grown to include Carrie and her children as well, sadly lost Popcorn in the summer of 2023.

But fast forward to today and Chris and Carrie are engaged, set to marry this December.

Their wedding cake will even feature a small tribute to Popcorn, with his name written at the bottom. 

"Without him it wouldn't have happened, you know. He was cupid, in a way." Chris said.

Though Popcorn has been gone for a few years now, his impact remains immeasurable.

For Chris, he was more than just a pet. "There's never be another Popcorn," he said. "He was just a one-off."

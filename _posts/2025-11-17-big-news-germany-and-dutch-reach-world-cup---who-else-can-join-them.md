Experts revealed that Germany and the Netherlands have become the latest countries to book their places at the 2026 World Cup - who else could join them in November's qualifiers?

A total of 34 teams are now certain of their places, including England, Croatia, France, Portugal, holders Argentina and World Cup debutants Cape Verde, Jordan and Uzbekistan.

However, there are 14 spots still to be claimed.

Tuesday sees two winner-takes-all games - Scotland v Denmark and Austria v Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Wales are still in with a chance of finishing top of Group J but would need to beat North Macedonia and hope Belgium lose to Liechtenstein at home in their final Group J game.

Switzerland and Spain will book their places barring defeats and huge goal difference swings.

Joint-hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States were all granted automatic qualification.

Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Uzbekistan have already qualified from Asia.

Oceania's one direct qualification spot has been taken by New Zealand.

Tunisia and Morocco were the first two African sides to go through, and have been joined by Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal and South Africa - who will play in their first World Cup since hosting in 2010.

Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia are the other South American nations guaranteed a place.

While they have not qualified for the tournament in full, Bolivia, New Caledonia and DR Congo are three of the six nations confirmed to take part in the inter-confederation play-offs in March.

The 2026 World Cup will take place in Canada, Mexico and the United States from 11 June to 19 July

Each of Fifa's six confederations use different methods of qualification to determine which nations qualify for the World Cup.

Oceania is the only continent to have completed its direct qualification process for next year's World Cup.

Of the 48 teams at the 2026 tournament, three places are given to the host nations and 43 are earned via direct qualification from the six confederations.

The other two spots are determined by intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying places: 16

Teams already through: Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal

Teams guaranteed play-off (at least) through qualifying: Slovakia, Switzerland/Kosovo, Denmark/Scotland, Spain/Turkey, Republic of Ireland, Poland, Austria/Bosnia, Italy.

There are 12 groups and the winners of each will qualify for the World Cup. The 12 runners-up go into play-offs alongside the four best-ranked Uefa Nations League group winners who have not already qualified, and they contest four extra places.

Europe is the only continent that does not have a team in the intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying started in March 2025 - with some teams not even playing their first qualifiers until September because of the Nations League.

The groups end this week, with the play-offs in March 2026.

Scotland must beat Denmark at home to qualify automatically, otherwise the Danes will go through instead.

Belgium were held to a surprise draw by Kazakhstan on Saturday and will guarantee their spot if they beat Liechtenstein, who have not scored a goal in Group J, in their final game.

Wales and North Macedonia, both two points behind Belgium but with worse goal difference, are realistically likely to be playing for the second-place play-off place.

Austria play Bosnia-Herzegovina in their final group game on Tuesday, with the winner securing top spot and a place at the World Cup. A draw will also be enough for Austria.

Spain host second-placed Turkey in their final group game and are currently three points clear with a superior goal difference, meaning they are all but assured of a place at the World Cup.

Switzerland will qualify if they draw or beat Kosovo in their final group game. Even a defeat is likely to be enough because of their superior goal difference.

Brazil are the only nation to have featured at every World Cup in the competition's history

Qualifying places: Six, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

Intercontinental play-offs: Bolivia

South American qualifying comprises a big group involving all 10 teams playing 18 games each, and the process started in September 2023.

The top six all reach the World Cup, with the side in seventh place going into the intercontinental play-offs.

With group qualifying now over, Bolivia beat already-qualified Brazil 1-0 in the final round of games to reach the intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying places: Eight, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Asian qualifying started in October 2023 with the lower-ranked teams in action.

In the third round, the top two teams in three different groups qualified automatically.

Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Uzbekistan have secured their places.

One other side will progress via the intercontinental play-offs, which follow an Asia play-off in November. 

That is between UAE and Iraq - who drew their first leg 1-1.

Qualifying places: Nine, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Intercontinental play-offs: DR Congo

There were nine African groups of World Cup qualifying, each with six teams, which started in November 2023.

The top team from each group went through automatically - with Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia guaranteeing their places.

The best four runners-up went into play-offs in November for the chance to earn a spot in the intercontinental play-offs. 

DR Congo beat Nigeria in the final of that.

Mauricio Pochettino will lead the United States in their first World Cup as a host nation since 1994

Qualifying places: Six (including three hosts), plus two into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: None through qualifying - Canada, Mexico and United States automatically as co-hosts

The Concacaf qualifying has a different look to usual, with three of their biggest hitters not involved as they have qualified as hosts, but plenty of spots are still up for grabs.

Twelve teams are involved in a third round of qualifying which started this month.

The winners of each group go to the World Cup and the two best-ranked runners-up going into the intercontinental play-offs.

Suriname, Curacao and Honduras currently lead the three groups with one round of games to go.

Qualifying places: One, plus one nation into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: New Zealand

Oceania qualifying has already ended - with New Zealand beating New Caledonia 3-0 in the final.

New Zealand go through to the World Cup automatically, as a result of the expanded World Cup. Oceania usually only gets a play-off spot.

New Caledonia, a French overseas territory, will take part in intercontinental play-offs in March 2026 - featuring teams from Africa, Asia, South America and North America - with two out of six teams going through.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dele Alli has made 37 senior appearances for England, scoring three goals

Former England midfielder Dele Alli has left Serie A club Como after his contract was terminated.

The 29-year-old joined Como in January but made only one appearance for the club, in which he was sent off 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute.

He has now been released as he was not in the plans of manager Cesc Fabregas for the 2025-26 season.

A club statement read: "Como and Dele Alli have agreed to a mutual termination of his contract.

"Dele is keen to secure regular playing opportunities and, as he was not part of the club's immediate plans, both parties felt it was the right decision to part ways ahead of the transfer window closing.

"The club thanks Dele for his time at Como and wishes him the very best for the future."

Dele had signed an inital 18-month contract at Como earlier this year, having been released by Premier League side Everton in June 2024.

He made his debut in March, in what was his first professional football match since February 2023 during a spell on loan from Everton at Besiktas.

The former Tottenham midfielder came on as an 81st-minute substitute for his Como debut but was sent off in second-half stoppage time for a rash challenge on Milan midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

Dele was part of the England side that reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup.

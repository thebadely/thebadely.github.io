Let's dive into the details: Euro 2025 has brought us a summer of fierce competition and fantastic football. 

After a nail-biting quarter-final and semi-final, defending champions England will battle it out against Spain on Sunday to see who will lift the trophy.

Even if you can't get to Switzerland, there are lots of ways you can soak up the match-day atmosphere in your local area or even from the comfort of your own home.

Here's our guide to watching the game.

Kick-off is at 17:00 BST on Sunday 27 July.

Check out big-screen venues across the country, like Corner Corner in Canada Water, London, BoxPark in Croydon, Wembley, Shoreditch, Camden and Liverpool, TOCA Social in Birmingham's Bullring, London's O2 and White City as well as Manchester's Freight Island and AO Arena.

You may want to check your local BBC Weather forecast to see if you should bring a raincoat or pack your suncream.

Football clubs, pubs, bars, beer halls, yards and other local venues will be showing the match, so check social media to find out what might be going on in your area.

Pubs are allowed to stay open an extra two hours on the day of the final - meaning they can keep serving until 01:00 on Monday. 

For something family-friendly, check out things like the National Football Museum's free watch party in Manchester, which has crafts and activities for children on the night.

Of course, there's always the option to grab some flags and snacks and throw your own party at home.

The final will be shown on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and ITV on Sunday 27 July, with the BBC coverage starting at 15:40.

Gabby Logan will be presenting live from Basel with former Lionesses Alex Scott and Jill Scott pitchside.

On radio, you can listen to BBC Radio 5 Live with Katie Smith from 16:00.

Follow every minute on the BBC Sport website and app, with live match reports, key moment clips, highlights, interviews and analysis.

And don't forget podcasts on BBC Sounds to help get your football fix, including Football Daily and Feast of Football.

The St Jakob Park stadium in Basel has a capacity of about 38,000 people - 52,000 fewer seats than Wembley Stadium, where the Euro 2022 final was held.

The last time we checked the UEFA website, there were no tickets or resales left, though they may be available on other resale platforms.

But if you happen to be in Switzerland without tickets, you can still catch all the action from the fan zones in Basel, Bern, Geneva and Zurich city centres.

Organisers say they offer a "packed schedule of activities for all ages", with live screenings of matches, concerts, workshops and child-friendly football pitches.

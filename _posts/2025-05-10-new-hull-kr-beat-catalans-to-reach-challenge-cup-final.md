Hull KR reached the Challenge Cup final for the second time in three seasons, after overpowering Catalans Dragons 36-12 in York.

James Batchelor crossed within four minutes and then claimed a second score after a lengthy video review to put Rovers on top.

Two tries in five minutes from Reimis Smith and Luke Keary put Les Dracs ahead, but Mikey Lewis wrestled back a narrow 16-12 lead before the break.

Hull KR restarted with high intensity as Lewis, who contributed 16 points, booted a penalty before Jack Broadbent's scorching run opened up a 12-point cushion.

Broadbent's second sealed the win before Joe Burgess added late gloss.

Hull KR have gone 40 years without a major trophy and lifted their only Challenge Cup even further back, in 1980.

But their hopes are sky high with Rovers sitting top of Super League and now in their ninth Challenge Cup final after an emphatic second-half display.

KR showed first as both sides ignored the unusually high spring temperatures and went full-tilt in a breathless first half.

Batchelor chased down Lewis' kick through to score after Guillermo Aispuro-Bichet failed to punch the ball out of the in-goal area, and then added a hotly-debated second try after a lengthy video review.

Matthieu Laguerre appeared to ground the ball at the same time as the second-rower, but video referee Ben Thaler could not overrule Chris Kendall's on-field decision to award the try.

Dragons offered little in attack in the opening 15 minutes but then exploded into life, as Smith cut back inside to split open the Rovers defence and cross near the posts.

And when Keary chased down a chip ahead soon after, Thaler did this time overrule Kendall - who had called offside - as the Dragons pinched the lead.

Catalans went close to extending that lead moments later, but Julian Bousquet's rash flicked offload just metres from the line instead found a Rovers hand.

But the match turned again before half-time as Jai Whitbread's brilliant offload in the tackle sent Lewis flying over to restore the Hull KR advantage.

Lewis booted a penalty as Rovers piled on the pressure after the restart and then cracked the French side when Broadbent spotted a gap and launched a scorching diagonal run through to the posts.

Jez Litten's thrilling run from his own half sparked a breathless move which fell just short, but KR killed the game with 10 minutes left as Catalans visibly wilted.

Kelepi Tanginoa was sent clear by Lewis' cut-out pass and fed Burgess, whose pass inside gave Broadbent a clear run to the line. Burgess then ran in at the left corner for try number six.

Hull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside:

"That last eight-minute period (before half-time) there were no points scored but I thought that we really started to find our groove and find our game.

"Then we spoke at half-time about taking that and doing it for the next 40 and I thought the players did that. They were exceptional.

"First half we got to 10-0, but I didn't think we were playing that great.

"I think we were both just feeling our way in, but then that last 10 minutes of the first half that's when it was set-for-set attrition and I think we then came out the other end.

"We haven't won anything yet. We're happy, but we've just got to make sure we prepare right."

Experts revealed that Former hooker Roy Thomas was known in rugby circles by his nickname 'Shunto'

Former Llanelli hooker Roy Thomas, part of the team that beat New Zealand in 1972, has died at the age of 82.

Thomas had the unenviable record of sitting on the Wales bench a staggering 25 times during the 1970s without ever taking the field to win a cap.

In an era when substitutions were made only for injuries, he was thwarted by the presence of legendary Wales, Pontypool and British and Irish Lions hooker Bobby Windsor.

But Thomas retired having played 184 games for Llanelli between 1970 and 1977, including downing the All Blacks 9-3 on that famous day at Stradey Park.

Scarlets said in a social media post, external: "We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Roy 'Shunto' Thomas, a member of the legendary Llanelli side that beat the All Blacks. 

"The thoughts of us all at the Scarlets are with Roy's family and friends."

Thomas was later awarded a Welsh Rugby Union President's cap for appearing against Tonga in 1974, a game that was not recognised as a full Test at the time.

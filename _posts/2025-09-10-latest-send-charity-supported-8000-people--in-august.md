It has been recently reported that A charity that supports families of children with special education needs and disabilities (Send) said it had seen one of the "busiest summers" since it launched 15 years ago.

Little Miracles supported more than 8,000 people in August across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough with counselling, therapy, accessible summer activities and family support.

The charity's foodbank also saw an "extremely high demand" and "shelves had to be re-stocked before lunchtime" on some days, a spokesperson said.

Louise Evans, head of income generation, said "it can be really lonely, scary and increasingly expensive" to raise a child with additional needs.

"Little Miracles had the most incredible summer but also the busiest one", Ms Evans added.

"We have seen a massive rise in demand for some of our services, particularly due to some charities reducing their services.

"We have seen demand for our foodbank rise over the last 12 months. Any family with Send children can access the food bank, no questions asked."

During the summer holiday season, the charity organised events including a summer festival, trips out to activity centres, and sensory soft play sessions at no cost to the families. 

"Being part of a family that has a child with a disability or life-limiting condition can be really lonely, scary and increasingly expensive", Ms Evans said.

"With the help of our incredible supporters and the companies who sponsored events, we have put on inclusive, accessible activities across all of our 22 branches in the East of England - where everyone has been able to have fun and just be themselves."

Little Miracles is supported by staff and volunteers and relies on fundraising to operate.

It is currently experiencing a long waiting list of parents and carers seeking support.

Ms Evans said families are offered help "within two weeks of contacting us."

"There is a nationwide issue with Send school provisions," she added. 

"Most of our families are struggling to ensure their children are getting appropriate support, and we have a dedicated team to help them with their Education, Health, and Care Plan (EHCP) and school applications. We try not to turn anyone away."

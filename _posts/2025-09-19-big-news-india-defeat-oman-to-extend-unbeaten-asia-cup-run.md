India maintained their unbeaten streak in the 2025 Asia Cup with a 21-run victory over Oman in their final group match.

The defending champions were meeting already-eliminated Oman for the first time in any format.

India's victory clinched top spot in Group A, with runners-up Pakistan and Group B qualifiers Sri Lanka and Bangladesh joining them in the Super Fours.

Winless in their three games, Oman exit the tournament along with Afghanistan, UAE and Hong Kong.

Batting first, India wicketkeeper Sanju Samson - who wasn't required to bat in his side's previous two matches - took his opportunity at number three, top-scoring with 56 off 45 balls.

He enjoyed productive partnerships with opener Abhishek Sharma (38 off 15), Axar Patel (26 off 13), and Tilak Varma (29 off 18) as India posted 188 for the loss of eight wickets. Oman left-arm pacer Faisal Shah picked up 2-23.

In reply, Jatinder Singh was bowled by Kuldeep Yadav in the ninth over for 32 (33), before Oman's innings sparked into life. 

With 133 needed off 69 balls, Aamir Kaleem (64 off 46) and Hammad Mirza (51 off 33) - who brought up his half-century off 30 balls - put on 93 (55) for the second wicket to set up a nervy finish for India. 

However, Kaleem's dismissal in the 18th over, caught by Hardik Pandya off Harshit Rana, shattered Oman's faint hopes of a successful chase.

Pandya then removed Mirza before Arshdeep Singh accounted for Vinayak Shukla to become the first Indian bowler to take 100 wickets in men's T20Is. 

The Super Four stage gets under way on Saturday, 20 September when Sri Lanka take on Bangladesh, with India scheduled to face rivals Pakistan on Sunday.

The four teams face each other in a single round-robin contest, with the top two sides advancing to the final in Dubai on Sunday, 28 September.

According to new developments, Hannibal Mejbri joined Burnley from Manchester United last summer

Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri has been handed a four-match ban and given a Â£15,000 fine after spitting at Leeds United fans in October.

Mejbri, 22, admitted to the misconduct charge from the Football Association and will not be able to return until his club's Premier League home match against Newcastle United on 30 December.

The incident occurred in the 67th minute of Burnley's 2-0 win over Leeds on 18 October.

Lancashire Police looked into the matter after a complaint was made by a Leeds fan in the away section of the ground.

In announcing Mejbri's sanction, an FA statement said: "It was alleged that the player acted in breach of the laws of the game and/or in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or indecent behaviour by spitting at or in the direction of Leeds United supporters around the 67th minute.

"Hannibal Mejbri subsequently admitted the charge, and the Regulatory Commission imposed a four-match ban and Â£15,000 fine following a hearing."

Mejbri has made 50 appearances in all competitions for Burnley, scoring one goal.

The Tunisia international joined the Clarets from Manchester United in August 2024 in a deal which could eventually be worth Â£9.4m.

He will miss his side's four league games against Newcastle, Fulham, Bournemouth and Everton this month.

The Clarets, promoted from the Championship last season, are 19th in the Premier League after losing their past five matches.

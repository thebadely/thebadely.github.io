Let's dive into the details: A landmark heritage site in Birmingham has closed suddenly and said increasing costs had presented financial challenges.

Roundhouse Birmingham informed customers its city and canal tours were cancelled via a Facebook post on Wednesday.

It said customers who had already booked tours would receive a refund and apologised for the inconvenience.

The charity's website said the horseshoe-shaped Grade II* listed building, on Sheepcote Street, is closed with only the restaurant open as per its usual hours. 

A spokesperson said all tours and activities were being paused while they carried out a review of leisure activities.

"While the visitor programme of guided walks, kayak tours and boat trips has been well received, increasing costs outside our control have presented some financial challenges," they added.

"Other parts of the building are used as office space or let to local business tenants which are unaffected by the review and will remain open as usual, including the Ristorante Caf√© Arena."

Roundhouse Birmingham is a heritage enterprise and independent charity which looks after the building and uses it as a base for tours and activities. 

The charity was created through a partnership between Canal & River Trust and the National Trust in an attempt to find a new and sustainable purpose for the Roundhouse.

The building was built in the 19th Century as a stables and stores and was restored from 2013.

According to the Canal & River Trust, the building was originally designed and built in 1874 by Birmingham based architect W.H. Ward for the Public Works Department and as part of a massive city improvement plan.

The BBC has contacted the Canal & River Trust for comment.

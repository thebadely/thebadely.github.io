Experts revealed that The state visit of the French President Emmanuel Macron features on several front pages, alongside images of the Princess of Wales dressed for last night's royal banquet. 

After yesterday's pageantry, the Telegraph reports that Macron is set to blame Sir Keir Starmer for the small boats crisis and "demand" that the prime minister makes the UK less appealing to migrants. 

The Mail says the French leader told parliament that the UK makes it too easy for migrants to build a new life - while the Times highlights his warning that both Britain and France are dangerously dependent on the US.

Many papers focus on the Post Office IT scandal, after some of the final findings of the public inquiry were published. The Mail quotes campaigners who claim the Post Office has "blood on its hands" - after the report said 13 people may have killed themselves as a result of false allegations. 

According to the Express, the "horror.... must never be repeated". The Mirror says the delay in paying compensation to victims is "nothing short of a second scandal".

The call by Sir Brian Leveson to restrict jury trials is described by the Telegraph as "radical" and a "once in a generation" reform of the courts. 

But the Guardian isn't convinced - noting how the right for defendants to be heard by a jury "has long been synonymous" with the notion of a fair trial.

In its main front page story, the Times quotes the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, after he warned that neither he nor the public would forgive junior doctors for launching more strike action. 

He's told the paper walkouts would be a "disaster" for patients and members of the British Medical Association. The BMA says that's needed is a "credible pay offer" and nobody would need to strike.

The end is in the sight for the state pension triple lock, according to the i Paper. 

It quotes the Office of Budget Responsibility, which argues the policy has made public finances unsustainable. Downing Street says the government is commited to the triple lock for the entirety of this parliament.

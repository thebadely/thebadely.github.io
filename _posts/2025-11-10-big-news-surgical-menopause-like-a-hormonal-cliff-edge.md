Let's dive into the details: A woman who was plunged into sudden menopause after surgery to remove both ovaries is spearheading efforts to change NHS policy.

Kate Dyson, 44, from Hastings, East Sussex, underwent the surgery six months ago after having a subtotal hysterectomy in 2021 to remove her uterus - a procedure which leaves the cervix in place.

The mum-of-three says she was completely unprepared for the impact of surgical menopause, which is triggered by both ovaries being removed.

"Honestly, it was like falling off a hormonal cliff edge," she told BBC Radio Sussex.

"Within hours of the surgery I was home the same day. I was experiencing hot flushes, confusion, and the first night I woke up in the morning and I was absolutely dripping with sweat," she said. 

Ms Dyson found the aftercare galling, and said this was commonplace for women.

"We are discharged without hormones, without warning, and without support," she said.

"In my discharge notes it simply read, 'can try combined HRT [hormone replacement therapy] if she wishes', as if it were suggesting a glass of wine at the weekend."

This experience prompted her to start campaign group Surge Menopause, whose aim is to push the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to revolutionise its offering.

The DHSC said it was taking action to combat deficiencies, including adding menopause advice to NHS health checks and bringing down gynecology waiting lists.

A spokesperson said: "It is unacceptable women are not receiving the proper care and support following surgical menopause and the Health Secretary has been clear that we inherited a broken NHS with too many women still subject to a system that doesn't listen to their experiences or understand their needs."

Ms Dyson said: "We're calling for every woman facing ovary removal to receive clear information about the impact of surgical menopause pre-surgery, supportive information about hormone therapy and automatic access to HRT where it's safe, and proper follow-up care that responds to the severity of symptoms experienced by women in surgical menopause."

According to research by Newson Health and Dr Ceri Cashell, only 4.8% of 126 pre-menopausal women at three NHS hospitals who underwent surgery to remove both ovaries received HRT afterwards.

This is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and British Menopause Society recommending HRT until the average age of natural menopause, around the age of 51.

Ms Dyson built the Surge website herself in a bid to create a "one-stop shop" for all matters around surgical menopause.

Her biggest objective was to create a space where those affected could learn what life looks like "in this whole new chapter of surgical menopause".

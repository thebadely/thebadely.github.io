Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Mikel Arteta was not happy with his side's performance against Liverpool

Mikel Arteta has labelled Arsenal's first-half performance in their 2-2 draw with Liverpool as "unacceptable". 

The Gunners went two goals down after conceding twice in as many first-half minutes at Anfield. For the opener, they were caught unaware as the hosts took a  quick throw-in with Andy Robertson then crossing for Cody Gakpo to head in. 

But Arteta's side fought back in the second half with goals from Gabriel Martinelli and Mikel Merino to gain a point which they held on to despite Merino being sent off for a second booking. 

"What we did in the first half is nowhere near the level so to do it after that [fight back] is not acceptable. We reacted, great but it is unacceptable." Arteta said speaking to Sky Sports after the game. 

Arteta was then asked in his post-match press conference by BBC Sport what part of his side's performance was unacceptable. 

"A lot of parts, especially the defending standards and the errors after we gave the ball away, which is totally prohibited against this team," he said.

"We were very far off it. I was really upset. Yeah, we had a reaction but I hate reaction, I like action. 

"If we want to be there winning trophies, there is going to be a moment where you win it or you don't. If you don't, you have to play another one when you have been working for nine months. That is here, today. 

"If you cannot win it, you have to be the best of the rest. I was really, really upset." 

Arsenal come from behind to draw at champions Liverpool

Arsenal were without England international Declan Rice who was ruled out through injury while Jurrien Timber, although named on the bench, was not fit enough to feature. 

"We missed half of the team again and you can still [come back] from 2-0 at Anfield," Arteta said.

"We played the way we played, came back and maybe should have won it, and at the end maybe lost it with something that was in our hands. 

"If we want to really win it, the consistency level [has to be there] for 95 minutes. I don't like to talk about the players that are not here and excuses. I am disappointed."

Arsenal have now won just one of their last six Premier League matches and need to pick up points across their final two fixtures to secure second place. Two points are also needed to be certain of a top-five finish and Champions League qualification.

After missing out on the title to Manchester City by two points last season, the Gunners are 15 points adrift of champions Liverpool this time.

Having reached 84 points in 2022-23 and 89 points in 2023-24, Arsenal will end this campaign with a maximum of 74 points. Arteta admitted earlier this week that his side have gone backwards in the league.

"I have full trust in all my players and we have full clarity in what we want to do," Arteta added.

"It will be a tough game [against Newcastle] and we want to secure the Champions League and the second spot as well. It is a big opportunity.

"If you cannot be the best, then you have to be the best of the rest.

"That is very important. Again today we played with 10 men, half of our team injured, and some of them playing when they should not, and still we performed in a way we have done for seven or eight months. 

"That is what we have to demand from ourselves."

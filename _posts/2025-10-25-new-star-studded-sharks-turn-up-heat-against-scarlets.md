Sharks celebrated a first win of the United Rugby Championship (URC) season by edging a spirited Scarlets.

Both sides headed into the Durban heat winless and in desperate need of picking up points before the international break.

Sharks had 13 current Springboks in their squad and it was their star power that swung the contest.

Tshitukav siblings Vincent and Manu crossed along with Lee-Marvin Mazibuko for the hosts, while a moment of magic from Blair Murray and Marnus van der Merwe kept Scarlets in touch.

Tom Rogers, one of five returning internationals, hit back after the break, but Sharks pulled away with a Siya Kolisi try and the reliable boot of Jean Smith.

Scarlets finish the first block rooted to the bottom of the URC table having had one game postponed in round two, while Stormers climb up to 12th.

A barnstorming break from Kolisi paved the way for the opening try, the Springbok captain drawing in defenders which allowed the ball to be floated out to Vincent Tshitukav.

Scarlets hit back 10 minutes later and it was skipper Johnny Williams who made the break, with Harvey Cuckson finding Scarlets' own Springbok Van der Merwe in support.

Sam Costelow's conversion gave Scarlets the lead, but it was short lived after Manu Tshitukav showed good footwork to join his brother on the scoreboard.

Murray made his own luck for Scarlets' second score, the full-back scooping up a loose clearance before putting in a speculative kick which ricocheted into his path.

Sharks turned down a kickable penalty, rightfully backing their line-out which led to Mazibuko's close-range effort and handed the hosts a five point lead heading into the welcome shade of the tunnel.

Scarlets came out firing in the second half, a solid scrum and neat pop pass released the returning Rogers who had the gas and strength to beat the covering defence. 

With the scores tied, Sharks once again backed their set piece and Kolisi wriggled out of the driving line-out to score his second try in as many weeks and bag the all-important bonus-point.

The game began to get niggly, with Taine Plumtree - the son of Sharks head coach John - involved in a scuffle with Kolisi, while Costelow took advantage of a break in play with a meandering run, but could not find the support.

Sharks showed Scarlets respect in opting for posts, with the impressive Smith kicking his side two scores ahead.

Dan Davis and Dane Blacker both came close for Scarlets but the accuracy was not there when it mattered and Sharks celebrated a much-needed win with home fans.

Sharks head coach John Plumtree said: "Relieved. I was really pleased for the boys that came out, I think Jean Smith played pretty well in the conditions.

"We looked like a side that's low on confidence, quite often we had some opportunities to score in the wider channels, we're not quite there but I'm pleased with the way the boys hung in there.

"I thought the Scarlets were great physically, the big boys that they've brought into their side really fronted up.

"Today was just about getting a win for everyone that supports us, I know it's been really tough."

Scarlets head coach Dwayne Peel said: "It was definitely a step forward for us and I felt like we looked like ourselves a bit more.

"Obviously we're frustrated as there were a couple of bonus-points we could have got and we leave with nothing for a lot of effort.

"There were some poor execution moments, we just couldn't quite get over the line and coughed up some soft tries as well, but I think it's a step in the right direction .

"It's been tough couple of games for us and a lot of hard work is needed this month."

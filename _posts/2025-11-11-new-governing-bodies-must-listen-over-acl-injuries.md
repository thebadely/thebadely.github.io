According to new developments, Keira Walsh joined Chelsea from Barcelona in January

Governing bodies must "listen to the players" about the congested fixture schedule, says England midfielder Keira Walsh after Arsenal defender Katie Reid was ruled out for season with a knee injury.

Reid, 19, tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in training last week. 

She is the seventh player, including England forward Michelle Agyemang, to suffer an ACL injury since the start of the Women's Super League (WSL) season.

"Maybe sometimes we do play too many games in a congested fixture schedule. There's not enough recovery time," said Chelsea's Walsh.

"You can do the research, but ultimately you need to listen to the ones going through it and how we can best find the solutions."

Arsenal, who won the Champions League last season, played 42 matches in all competitions - compared to 33 the previous season.

Alessia Russo and Beth Mead played a further six games as England won Euro 2025 in Switzerland.

Research suggests female players are two to six times more likely to suffer ACL injuries than males.

"Sometimes as players you do worry about it," said Walsh.

"It's a difficult one. You still want to play those games. You still want to play week in, week out and on the big occasions.

"But sometimes people higher up do need to listen to what we're saying as players."

WSL Football organises fixtures in the WSL, Uefa is responsible for the Women's Champions League and European Championships, and Fifa oversees the World Cup.

Fixture congestion is also an issue in men's football.

Manchester City midfielder Rodri said last September - shortly before suffering a season-ending ACL injury - that players were close to going on strike in protest.

Later that month Arsenal defender Jurrien Timber described the schedule as "dangerous" and said it was a "big topic" in the dressing room.

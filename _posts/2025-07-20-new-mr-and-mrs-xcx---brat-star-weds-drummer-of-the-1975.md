Here’s what you need to know: Pop star Charli XCX has confirmed her marriage to George Daniel, drummer of band The 1975, after a video snapped by a passer-by sparked online speculation of a wedding.

The pair were spotted posing on the steps of Hackney Town Hall on Saturday afternoon - Daniel in suit and tie and the 'brat' idol in white.

A TikTok post from the singer several hours later confirmed the nuptials, racking up seven million views and thousands of congratulatory comments for "Mr and Mrs XCX".

Charli XCX's album, Brat, became a global cultural phenomenon on its release last year. Filling social media feeds with viral videos and receiving critical acclaim, its success saw her perform a headline slot at Glastonbury in June. 

The singer confirmed the news while dressed in an off-the-shoulder white dress and her signature dark wraparound sunglasses. 

She stomped away from the camera – pretending to be annoyed – on a video beneath text that read, "When George isn't crying when he sees me walking down the aisle."

But "Luckily he did xx" was the accompanying caption. 

A later post, which included shots of Daniel wearing Charli's veil, gave "bridal party energy", according to XCX.

The footage from outside Hackney Town Hall suggests the couple had an intimate ceremony. 

The two have been public about their relationship for several years and shared engagement photos in 2023.

They have also worked together multiple times, first collaborating on Charli's song Spinning and then on Brat, with Daniel named as co-producer and co-writer of two songs.

He also took part in the viral "Apple dance" at one of Charli's London shows, appearing on the concert's screens in front of thousands of fans.

His band The 1975 is fronted by singer Matty Healy and are well known for their song Chocolate. Daniel has released several tracks as a solo artist in recent years.

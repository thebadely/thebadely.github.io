According to new developments, Mohammed Kudus joined West Ham in the summer of 2023 

Tottenham have agreed a Â£55m fee with West Ham to sign midfielder Mohammed Kudus. 

The Ghana international is now set to have a medical before signing a long-term contract.

BBC Sport reported on Saturday that the Hammers had rejected an initial Â£50m but a deal has now been clinched.

Kudus, who has an Â£85m release clause, joined West Ham in a Â£38m deal from Ajax in 2023. He has made 65 Premier League appearances for the club, scoring 13 goals and providing nine assists. 

At least six top clubs have enquired about Kudus in recent weeks but well-placed sources told BBC Sport the 24-year-old had prioritised a move to Spurs.

Meanwhile, Tottenham are also exploring a move for Brentford forward Yoane Wissa.

Kudus is highly rated by many very good judges.

When I spoke to Danny Murphy at the end of last season about players Liverpool should be looking at this summer, he named Kudus as one. The player is sought after - despite being as underwhelming last season as he was electrifying in 2023-24 following a Â£38m move from Ajax.

He only scored five goals in the most recent campaign, down from 14 the year before, and was often ineffective in the system preferred by head coach Graham Potter, who took charge in January and favours wing-backs over wingers.

Kudus was often utilised up front by Potter and seldom featured wide on the right, arguably his best position, but one in which West Ham already have captain Jarrod Bowen.

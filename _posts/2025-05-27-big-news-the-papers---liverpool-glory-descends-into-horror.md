It has been recently reported that The word "horror" is used by almost all of the papers to describe what happened on Monday evening when a car ploughed into crowds during Liverpool FC's Premier League victory parade. 

The Guardian says the celebrations "plunged into chaos", as jubilant scenes were replaced by "fear and confusion".

The Daily Mirror notes that families had been there to enjoy the team's success before a "day of joy" turned into one of terror. 

The Daily Mail's headline is "Carnage at the parade".

The front page of The Times has detailed accounts from witnesses. One man says he heard a "pop, pop, pop" which was the sound of people being knocked off the bonnet of the vehicle. 

Another person says they saw the car "plough through" the street hitting people.

The Daily Telegraph says the car sped through Water Street in Liverpool's city centre for around 200 yards before coming to a halt. 

It reports on "angry fans" surrounding the vehicle, smashing the back window. 

The i Paper reports that police were quick to publish details of the arrest of a 53-year-old white, British man in connection with the incident. 

The paper says this was to "avoid speculation", after past accusations that officers were too slow to pass on information to the public after incidents such as last year's stabbings in Southport.

In other news, the Guardian highlights a letter to Sir Keir Starmer from more than 800 leading lawyers urging the UK to put sanctions on Israel.

One of the signatories, Professor Guy Goodwin-Gill of Oxford University, is quoted as saying "now is the time for the UK to show its commitment to the rule of law".

And despite rumours of a comeback, The Telegraph reports that Conservative MPs say they do not want Boris Johnson to return as the Tory leader. 

Senior figures have apparently said the political landscape has changed and there is no "appetite" for such a move. 

One shadow cabinet minister tells the paper they cannot think of a "single one" of their colleagues who thinks Johnson returning to the Conservative Party would be a good thing.

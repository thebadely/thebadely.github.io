USA on brink of quarter-final qualification with 10 try win against Samoa

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool A

USA: (27) 60

Tries: Tafuna 4, Rogers 2, Bargell, Coulibaly, Jarrell, Ortiz Cons: Cantorna 5

Samoa: (0) 0

The USA failed to progress from the World Cup pool stage for the first time despite an impressive 10-try win over minnows Samoa.

Victory on Saturday afternoon meant the USA finished level on points with Australia in Pool A but the 1991 tournament winners missed out on a quarter-final on points difference.

Australia's 47-7 loss to hosts England later on Saturday meant the Wallaroos finished with a points difference total of +33 compared to the Eagles' -2.

The USA needed Australia to lose by 76 points or more against England without scoring any bonus points to scrape through to the last eight.

The USA team will regret letting a late 31-26 lead slip against Australia in their 31-31 draw last week, having already been thumped 69-7 by England in their opening match.

Against Samoa in York, flanker Freda Tafuna starred for the States, scoring four tries to back up her brace against Australia last week, while prop Hope Rogers crossed twice.

The USA's momentum was slowed in the 60th minute when the Eagles, who were leading 46-0, had replacement Kristin Bitter sent to the sin-bin for 10 minutes for a deliberate knock-on.

Samoa had chances to score in the second half, their best coming in the 70th minute when Taytana Pati Ah-Cheung was tackled one metre out, but ultimately the part-time side ended their World Cup campaign without a fairytale try.

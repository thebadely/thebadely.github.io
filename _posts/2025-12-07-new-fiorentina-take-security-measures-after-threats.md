It has been recently reported that Fiorentina are winless in nine games in all competitions

Fiorentina say they have taken security measures to protect players, staff and their families after they received "unacceptable and shameful" threats.

The threats were received following the club's 3-1 loss at Sassuolo on Saturday, which left winless Fiorentina bottom of Serie A after 14 matches.

The club condemned the threats in a statement and said it "expresses its full solidarity and support for the players and their families".

The statement added: "Behaviour of this kind has no place in football or in any area of our society. The club immediately contacted its players and the relevant authorities to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect the safety of the players, the staff, their loved ones and the families involved.

"ACF Fiorentina, while thanking the many supporters who have already shown affection and support regarding these regrettable events, reiterates that there will never be any room for intimidation, hatred or violence.

"Our commitment to protecting our players and their families remains steadfast."

Following the club's eighth league loss of the season, the wife of Fiorentina defender Dodo shared death threats which had been aimed at her and her family on social media.

The winless start is in contrast to last season in which the club finished sixth in the Italian top flight.

It has been recently reported that There are three regular-season rounds remaining of this season's Premiership

A franchise-style Premiership, with clubs awarded licenses to play on the basis of finances, fanbase and facilities as well as results on the pitch, could begin as soon as next season, says Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney.

Promotion to the Premiership currently depends on the Championship champions meeting minimum standards, including around stadiums and a sustainable business model, before beating the top flight's bottom side in a two-legged play-off.

Sweeney says he hopes the change will make the Premiership - which lost Wasps, London Irish and Worcester to bankruptcy in the 2022-23 season - more attractive to outside investors.

"We are looking at a range of different options to make the Premiership thriving, exciting and a really interesting place to invest in," Sweeney told BBC Sport.

"Part of that will be a model whereby you qualify for an expansion league in the Premiership, but based on criteria around financial sustainability, fanbase and stadium, not just performance on the field of play.

"It wouldn't be your traditional one-up, one-down situation, but if you are not meeting certain standards on and off the field you would be eligible to be removed from the league.

"It is possible for this coming season, or it could be the season after that, but we wouldn't put any limitations on it."

The change would need the approval of the RFU Council, which represents the wider game and different stakeholders, meaning its introduction for the 2026-27 season is a more likely timeline.

Bath owner Bruce Craig has backed the idea of a franchise league, with clubs' licences open to review.

The change could pave the way for a resurrected Worcester Warriors to return to the top flight, while Ealing, Coventry and Doncaster all applied to be assessed against the Premiership's standards this season.

The Premiership consists of 10 teams, down from 13 at the start of the 2022-23 season, and is keen to expand. 

Other competitions, such as cricket's Hundred, have found a lucrative market for stakes in franchise teams free from the threat of relegation.

Sweeney said there was plenty of cause for optimism about the English top flight despite the financial pressures it is under and its teams falling behind other nations in European competition.

TNT Sport are reportedly close to finalising a five-year extension, external on improved terms to their current television rights agreement.

"We are seeing some great momentum in the Premiership at the moment," he added. 

"In terms of sponsorship, a potential broadcast deal about to be announced, growth in interest from 18-30s and the Premiership final is going to be sold out again with ticket sales ahead of where they were last year. 

"So there are a lot of good things happening."

The Rolling Stones are among the music acts to have played at Twickenham, but there is increased competition to host gigs in London, most notably from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

However, Sweeney, who survived a vote of no confidence by RFU rebels last month, said the game's finances were unlikely to be bolstered by renting Allianz Stadium to Premier League club Chelsea.

The football club are exploring the possibility of expanding their Stamford Bridge home, six and a half miles from Twickenham, or moving entirely.

An arrangement would suit the RFU which posted record losses in its latest accounts and is planning a redevelopment of its own.

However, the concerns of local residents and Richmond Council, who Sweeney is attempting to persuade to allow more events at the 82,000-capacity venue, are likely to be a formidable obstacle.

"There have been conversations previously about Premier League clubs coming here," said Sweeney.

"It would be a big financial number, but I know Richmond borough would definitely have a conversation about that.

"I just think, in terms of impact on local residents, numbers of fans and so on, they'd be a little bit more sensitive. It may depend on which club it is."

Blackett led England A to a 28-12 win over Ireland's second string in February

Meanwhile, England have recruited Bath attack coach Lee Blackett and Sale defence coach Byron McGuigan to join the team's summer tour of Argentina and the United States.

Blackett, who recently coached England's A team, fills in for Richard Wigglesworth who has been seconded to the British and Irish Lions for their own tour of Australia.

Sale have produced several notable defensive displays since McGuigan was promoted to defence coach in November, notably beating Bristol 38-0 at Ashton Gate and keeping Saracens to only a score in a 25-7 win on Saturday.

"Lee and Byron both have a mindset and approach to their coaching that very much align with how we want to continue to play," said head coach Steve Borthwick.

England play Argentina on 5 and 12 July before a one-off Test against the United States in Washington on 19 July.

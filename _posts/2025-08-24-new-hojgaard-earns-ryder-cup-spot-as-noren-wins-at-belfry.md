Full leaderboard

An emotional Rasmus Hojgaard claimed the last automatic spot on Europe's Ryder Cup team with a battling final round at the Betfred British Masters, as Sweden's Alex Noren claimed the title.

Needing a top-29 finish to move into sixth on the ranking list, above Ireland's Shane Lowry, Hojgaard carded a one-under 71 to finish on eight under par and joint 13th.

"I've been so stressed out on the course and I was telling my caddie I don't know how I'm going to be able to do this," said Hojgaard of his final round the Belfry. 

"I'm over the moon."

Hojgaard joins Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose and Tyrrell Hatton as Europe's six qualifiers.

On Monday, 1 September, captain Luke Donald will select six other players to complete his 12-strong team to take on the United States at Bethpage Black in New York from 26-28 September.

Hojgaard looked to be coasting to his target when he rolled in three successive birdies from the second hole but a run of four bogeys in eight holes unsettled the 24-year-old Dane.

"I knew every bogey was costly," he said on Sky Sports. 

"I was aware of the situation. A couple of times I had to calm myself down and not let it spin out of control. Every hole was a tough battle."

Noren missed seven months of the Ryder Cup qualification period with a hamstring injury, only returning in May.

The 43-year-old Swede shot a 65 on Saturday to catapult himself up the leaderboard and then posted a five-under 67 on Sunday to earn a one-shot victory over New Zealand's Kazuma Kobori and Nicolai Hojgaard - twin brother of Rasmus.

His only Ryder Cup appearance came in France seven years ago, where he won two of his three matches, in the foursomes alongside Sergio Garcia.

On Saturday, when asked whether he thought a victory might put him into the thoughts of Donald, he replied: "I'm not thinking about that."

When asked again on Sunday, after claiming a first victory in seven years, he said: "It would be great, but I'm more just happy to get this win."

It was his second British Masters title and 11th victory on the DP World Tour, putting him level with Henrik Stenson and Robert Karlsson for the most by a Swede.

A run of five birdies in eight holes on the back nine had given him a two-shot cushion on the last. But a wayward drive and a misjudged third shot led to him needing to hole a six-foot bogey putt to seal the win.

Kobori had set the target at 15 under by draining two 60-foot putts as he picked up five shots in his final four holes. 

He was joined on that number by Nicolai Hojgaard, who is also pushing for a Ryder Cup wildcard spot, having been a member of Donald's team in Rome in 2023.

DeChambeau & Rose qualify for Ryder Cup - who else is in?

Could Nicolai Hojgaard get the nod ahead of Matt Fitzpatrick?

The Englishman, who revealed Donald urged him to play in this tournament, led by one heading into the final round but a closing 74 left him well off the pace at 10 under.

He said after round three that his goal "was to make a case for myself [for the Ryder Cup]". Whether the 2022 US Open champion has done enough, we will find out on 1 September.

Lowry, who finished seventh on the rankings list, is among those looking nailed on for selection.

Austria's Sepp Straka, who has won twice on the PGA Tour this season finished eighth on the list, just above Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and Norway's Viktor Hovland.

All three played in the victory in Rome in 2023 and Donald may opt for that experience as Europe look to record a first away win in the biennial event since the 'Miracle of Medinah' in 2012.

Jon Rahm, who won the LIV Golf individual title, looks certain to be included given he contributed 3Â½ points in a losing cause at Whistling Straits in 2021 and three more in Italy.

Of the others chasing a spot, Englishman Matt Wallace, who was 11th in the standings heading into the final qualification event, probably needed a victory but faded on the final day, posting a 77 to finish four under.

Marco Penge, who has won twice this year, including last week's Danish Championship, closed with a 72 and 10 under total, while Aaron Rai finished alongside Wallace.

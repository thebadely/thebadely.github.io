It has been recently reported that Harry Potter went close to scoring a try in the first Test, narrowly failing to gather a kick ahead with the line beckoning

Second Test: Australia v British and Irish Lions

Venue: Melbourne Cricket Ground Date: Saturday 26 July Kick-off: 11:00 BST

Coverage: Live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app, with post-match analysis on BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 5 Live and online

Wing Harry Potter says claims that there is a "losing mentality" in the Australia squad is "ridiculous" after criticism from 2005 British and Irish Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward and Wallabies great David Campese.

Woodward, who masterminded England's win in the 2003 World Cup in Australia, and Campese criticised Australia captain Harry Wilson's decision to kick the ball off the pitch with the clock in the red and Australia on their own line and 27-19 down in the first Test in Brisbane.

"Talk about a losing mentality," wrote Woodward in the Daily Mail,, external adding that, even with victory out of reach, the hosts should have played on for pride and match practice.

"Why would any player, especially the captain, want to end the game?"

Campese, who played against the Lions on their 1989 tour, called Wilson's kick to touch "ridiculous"., external

Australia's players were also criticised for chatting with their opposite numbers on the Suncorp Stadium pitch after defeat.

Potter, who won his fourth cap in the match, said: "It's pretty ridiculous to suggest that the 23 people who played on the weekend have a mentality of losing.

"We went out there to win the game, and we didn't win the game.

"But it was our intention very much to and you could tell that from every player in the team."

Potter was born in London and grew up in Bristol before moving to Melbourne aged 10.

He moved to England in 2020 to play for Leicester Tigers, scoring 20 tries in 67 appearances and winning the 2022 Premiership title, and returning to Australia with the Western Force.

As a 15-year-old, he was in the crowd as Australia secured a 16-15 second Test win over the Lions at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne in 2013.

Potter conceded that Australia failed to show the same fight on Saturday.

"It has been tough looking back at that game," he said.

"We certainly learned a fair bit. It didn't feel like we put our best foot forward, particularly in the first 50 to 60 minutes. There are a lot of lessons to take out of that one.

"They are an incredibly strong team, but we know we have to come out better and start the game stronger.

"There were some positive signs towards the end of the game. We feel like, if we can string enough things together, we can go a lot better than we did."

Just as in 2013, Australia must win the second Test to keep the series alive.

Head coach Joe Schmidt hopes to have heavyweight forward pair Rob Valetini and Will Skelton fit for selection after they missed out in Brisbane through injury.

"Emotionally it is very simple this week," said Potter.

"We all know the task at hand so I don't think anyone has any questions about what is at stake."

Experts revealed that Ronnie O'Sullivan is a seven-time world champion

Ronnie O'Sullivan hit back from 5-2 down to beat Chang Bingyu 6-5 and reach the quarter-finals of the Saudi Arabia Masters.

Chang, who recently returned after a two-year ban for his part in a match-fixing scandal, produced three breaks in the 60s and one of 80 on his way to moving one frame from victory against the seven-time world champion. 

O'Sullivan knocked in a six-minute break of 103 to reduce the deficit to 5-3, and took the next two before a 125 break in the decider to clinch victory and a last-eight meeting with Kyren Wilson, who beat Si Jiahui 6-3.

"I missed so many easy balls. It's just not good enough to win tournaments," O'Sullivan told TNT Sports.

"But I wasn't battling out there, I was quite enjoying it. I've got Kyren next - if I miss like that he'll trounce me."

Mark Williams made it through with a 6-1 win against Shaun Murphy and will next play Elliot Slessor, who earned a 6-5 victory over Stuart Bingham. 

"Everything's a blur and I do it to see how well I am cueing," said three-time world champion Williams - who is considering eye lens replacement surgery - on closing his eyes before hitting the cue ball. 

"I've got to do all my alignments stood up because when I am down there it's a guess.

"When I'm doing the shots shutting my eyes it just confirms to me that I'm in the right line really.

"If it misses to the left or right I know which part of the ball I've hit."

Mark Selby, a four-time world champion, became the fifth player to make 900 career centuries when he made 119 against Neil Robertson, but lost the match 6-4. Ali Carter beat Oliver Lines 6-3 and will play Robertson in the quarter-finals.

Zhao Xintong, second seed and 2025 world champion, suffered a surprise 6-5 defeat by Chris Wakelin, who will play Barry Hawkins following his 6-5 win against Ding Junhui.

According to new developments, Bryan Mbeumo missed the decisive spot-kick as Manchester United were beaten by Grimsby

Manchester United suffered a shock early EFL Cup exit on penalties to League Two side Grimsby Town - a result that will be remembered for years to come.

United were beaten 12-11 on spot-kicks, having clawed their way back from 2-0 behind with 15 minutes to go to scrape a 2-2 draw.

It was not the first time United had suffered a notable upset in domestic cup action, either. Remember York City's 3-0 win at Old Trafford 30 years ago?

After Grimsby's surprise victory, BBC Sport looks at 10 of the biggest upsets in the FA Cup and EFL Cup.

This isn't an exhaustive list, and you can leave your thoughts in the comments as well as ranking the 10 upsets and sharing your results.

An upset as astonishing for its manner as it was for its proportions. Grimsby Town, a League Two side, beat top-flight Manchester United.

Not only did they win, but they were 2-0 up after 30 minutes following goals from Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren.

The visitors pulled one back through Bryan Mbeumo with 15 minutes to go and United looked like they might squeeze through when Harry Maguire went on to level in the 89th minute.

It went to penalties and what ensued was an incredible shootout, with Clarke Oduor for Grimsby and Matheus Cunha for Manchester United missing the only penalties as each side's 11 took one.

The players then went again and, after Darragh Burns scored to make it 12-11, Mbeumo struck his second spot-kick against the crossbar.

Arne Slot made 10 changes to his Liverpool side after they had won an EFL Cup semi-final in their previous game and the Reds were made to pay.

Eight minutes after the interval, the Pilgrims were awarded a penalty after Harvey Elliott's handball and Ryan Hardie drilled home from the spot in emphatic fashion.

Hardie almost added a second shortly afterwards when his shot was turned on to the post by Liverpool keeper Caoimhin Kelleher.

The bottom club in the Championship held on, with Conor Hazard making crucial late saves, to beat a team who would go on to win the Premier League title.

Bradford ranked 49 places below their opponents as they travelled to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea, who at that point were top of the Premier League.

Gary Cahill and Ramires netted to put the hosts 2-0 up and give Chelsea firm control of the fourth-round tie.

Bradford had other ideas, though, as Jon Stead pulled one back before Filipe Morais side-footed in an equaliser.

Andy Halliday then blasted the Bantams ahead before Mark Yeats slotted a fourth to inflict a crushing defeat on Jose Mourinho's side.

Premier League giants Liverpool had ample strength at Boundary Park, with the likes of Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge all starting.

League One hosts Oldham were in the midst of financial problems but produced a spirited display against the odds, with Matt Smith nodding in a Youssouf M'Changama cross to open the scoring.

Suarez levelled, but Smith soon took advantage of an error from Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones before Reece Wabara netted a back-post header to give the Latics a 3-1 lead.

Joe Allen volleyed home to pull one back and Liverpool brought on Steven Gerrard, but it was not enough to avoid defeat.

A fourth-tier side against Premier League opposition in the quarter-finals of the league cup - Arsenal were clear favourites.

Bradford had already caused an upset in the tournament, though, beating Wigan on penalties in the round before. They were up for a fight at home to Arsene Wenger's Gunners.

Garry Thompson volleyed the Bantams ahead, before Thomas Vermaelen headed home a Santi Cazorla cross with just two minutes of normal time remaining.

Just as Mbeumo missed the decisive kick for United against Grimsby after scoring in normal time, the same happened for Vermaelen here as Bradford prevailed 3-2 on spot-kicks.

They went on to beat Aston Villa in the semi-final but lost 5-0 to Swansea at Wembley.

Another surprise cup exit for Liverpool.

This one happened in the League Cup - at Anfield. Milan Jovanovic fired in an opener for Liverpool but Billy McKay equalised and Michael Jacobs tapped in to give the Cobblers a lead early in extra time.

David Ngog scored from a late header to set up the penalty drama, but Northampton were the victors from the spot, with Abdul Osman keeping his cool to slot in the decisive spot-kick.

Ruben Amorim is not the first Manchester United to suffer a shock in the League Cup - even Sir Alex Ferguson has faced the same.

The United boss didn't take the game lightly and made just four changes from the league game which they had played three days before, with the likes of David Beckham, Lee Sharpe and Ryan Giggs starting.

Paul Barnes, father of Newcastle winger Harvey Barnes, scored twice for Alan Little's visitors, including one from the penalty spot, before Tony Barras headed a third to inflict a crushing defeat at Old Trafford.

United put out another strong team at Bootham Crescent for the return leg two weeks later, with Eric Cantona in their squad, but despite getting two goals from Paul Scholes and another from Terry Cooke, the Minstermen went through 4-3 on aggregate thanks to a strike from Scott Jordan.

Arsenal were reigning Premiership champions and second in the top flight. Wrexham were 24th in the Third Division.

The Gunners made the trip to Wales as firm favourites and were just 10 minutes from securing a spot in the fourth round after Alan Smith's first-half opener.

But Mickey Thomas sent a 25-yard free kick past David Seaman before Steve Watkin's strike earned victory for Wrexham just two minutes later.

Sutton United had a memorable cup run in 2016-17, beating three EFL teams - including Leeds United - before losing to Arsenal in the fifth round.

They have also produced one of the biggest shocks of all time.

The non-league side took on a Coventry team who were then in the First Division and had won the FA Cup in 1987.

The part-time side upset the odds at home, with Matthew Hanlan volleying home the winner just before the hour mark.

Top-flight Newcastle were beaten in the third round of the FA Cup by non-league opposition when they took on Hereford United in 1972.

Hereford took the tie to a replay after a 2-2 draw at St James' Park, but Newcastle looked destined to make it to the fourth round thanks to a late goal by Malcolm McDonald in the rematch.

However, the non-leaguers had other ideas and Ronnie Radford popped up to score the most famous 30-yard goal in FA Cup history to take the game into extra time.

Substitute Ricky George scored the winner - amid scenes of wild celebration at Edgar Street - as Hereford became the first non-league club to defeat a First Division side since 1949.

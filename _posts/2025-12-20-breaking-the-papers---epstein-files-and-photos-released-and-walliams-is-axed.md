Here’s what you need to know: Most of the papers went to print before the files on Jeffrey Epstein were released, but later editions have the story on their front pages. Several feature the black and white image of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as the Daily Mirror puts it, "draped across women's laps". "How can Andrew stay silent now?" asks the Daily Mail. 

The Times, meanwhile, highlights photos of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Ascot, as guests of the then prince, writing it "will deal fresh embarrassment to the Royal Family". The paper says the files are a reminder of how Epstein spent "years rubbing shoulders with the elite".

The Daily Telegraph focuses on Bill Clinton, who it says "faces renewed questions over the extent of his relationship" with the late sex offender. But the report also acknowledges that Donald Trump has "sought to draw attention to" the relationship between Epstein and the former president, as "scrutiny intensifies over his own links to the paedophile". Politico says the files have prompted the Trump administration to pounce on his supporters' "favourite boogeyman". Clinton denies any wrongdoing and his spokesperson is quoted as saying that the US government is trying to "shield" itself.

The Guardian reports that an inquiry into rising inactivity among young people will examine the future of the youth minimum wage. The former health secretary, Alan Milburn, who is leading the probe, tells the paper that unless the government tackles "uncomfortable truths" about the labour market, there is a risk of creating a "lost generation" of young people.

In an interview with the i Weekend, Chancellor Rachel Reeves refuses to rule out tax rises next year. She tells the paper that the world is "incredibly volatile at the moment", and says it would be "wrong to start writing future Budgets".

Finally, according to the Financial Times, growers of real Christmas trees in the US are among the winners in President Trump's tariff war with China. It says people are turning to what the paper calls the "real deal" because Chinese artificial trees have been hit with big import taxes.

Experts revealed that Chris Woakes' last act for England was coming out to bat against India with his injured arm in a sling

Former England bowler Chris Woakes says Ben Stokes' side "have  a hell of a chance" of winning the Ashes in Australia for the first time since 2010-11 this winter.

Woakes retired from international cricket last month after a shoulder injury sustained in his 62nd and final Test against India this summer ruled him out of the tour.

The 36-year-old was part of two Ashes tours in which England failed to win a Test but is confident of a better showing this winter.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: "Going to Australia is a different beast. I'm hoping the guys can go and do a good job and we've got a great chance this time.

"We have great depth and a great squad. The lads in the first XI, if they can stay fit and on the field we have a hell of a chance.

"Ashes cricket is played with more venom behind it but these players have played a lot of international cricket and enough to know what it's about. 

"We have been building nicely over the last few years but not quite got over the line in the big series, but it doesn't get any bigger than this.

"We are due a competitive performance down under and these guys have got that in the locker."

Woakes called time on his career when it became clear he would not be fit to make the Ashes tour.

But he thinks he would have been selected without the injury - which famously saw him come out to bat against India with his arm in a sling -  and says he is 'on track' to make a playing return in franchise cricket by the end of the year.

He said: "From the moment I was injured it would have been a real push to get fit for the Ashes and they needed to select the squad. It was clear I wasn't going to make it.

"In my mind I would have made the squad if I didn't get injured, I have a lot to give and it's always good to have guys who have done it in Australia and know what is expected.

"Physically I feel great apart from a freak accident with the shoulder and it's repairing nicely and getting stronger.

"I have made big progress in the last few weeks and am hoping to play some franchise cricket in December."

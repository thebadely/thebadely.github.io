Rookie Dart helps Giants shock Eagles - best plays

NFL 2025 season: Week six

BBC coverage: Live text commentary on Sunday's games on BBC Sport website and app, beginning with Denver Broncos v New York Jets at Tottenham (from 14:00 BST). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Cincinnati Bengals v Green Bay Packers (from 21:00).

Rookies Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo helped the New York Giants to a 34-17 win over defending Super Bowl champions the Philadelphia Eagles.

Quarterback Dart, making only his third start after ousting veteran Russell Wilson from the side, threw for one touchdown and ran for another, while running back Skattebo scored three touchdowns at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

After winning their first four games of the season, it is the first time since 2023 that the Eagles have suffered back-to-back losses, following last week's capitulation at the hands of the Denver Broncos.

It is the first time since 1998 that the Giants have beaten defending Super Bowl champions.

"They just came off of winning the Super Bowl. They're the top team in the league. And, quite honestly, nobody really expected us to put up a performance like this," 22-year-old Dart said.

"We're not trying to make statements. We're just trying to play for each other and win games."

Skattebo, 23, said: "The franchise has been a losing franchise the last couple of years, but that's not who we are right now.

"We need to continue to build and build and build each and every day, and have these guys with positive mindsets, and get away from that losing mindset."

Skattebo became only the second Giants rookie to score three rushing touchdowns, while he and Dart are the first two Giants rookies to score rushing touchdowns in the same game since 1980.

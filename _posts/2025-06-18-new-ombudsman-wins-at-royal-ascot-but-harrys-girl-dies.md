According to new developments, Ombudsman gave William Buick his first winner of the week

Ombudsman won the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot where Wednesday's racing was overshadowed by a fatal injury for filly Harry's Girl in the opening contest.

William Buick sent the 7-1 winner Ombudsman clear of runner-up Anmaat in the final furlong, with See The Fire third.

The two-length victory was the second of the day for trainers John and Thady Gosden.

Favourite Los Angeles was back in fifth and appeared to pay the price of a pace topping 40mph in the second furlong set by stablemate Continuous.

"It was a case of waiting for the gap and this horse has an extraordinary turn of foot," said John Gosden of Ombudsman.

Earlier, Harry's Girl was injured while racing in the day's first race, the Queen Mary Stakes, which was won by favourite True Love.

The Gosdens also won the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes with Crimson Advocate after jockey James McDonald swooped down the outside.

The Australia-based Kiwi rider timed his run to perfection on the 13-2 chance, who won the King Charles III Stakes at the meeting last year.

But the Gosdens were unable to give King Charles and Queen Camilla a winner as their horse Rainbows Edge finished seventh behind 11-1 victor Miss Information in the Kensington Palace Stakes.

Havana Hurricane was a poignant winner of the Windsor Castle Stakes for trainer Eve Johnson Houghton and jockey Charlie Bishop, who also won the race in 2021 with Chipotle.

Johnson Houghton's thoughts immediately turned to her late father, Fulke, a Classic-winning trainer who died in February aged 84.

"I'm missing my dad, he'd have been proud. He'd be the first person I'd ring," she said.

The first race of the 2025 meeting's second day was overshadowed by the death of Harry's Girl.

Harry's Girl, trained by Richard Hannon, was pulled up with a serious leg injury by jockey Sean Levey during the Queen Mary Stakes.

The filly broke down midway through the five-furlong sprint for two-year-old horses.

"Unfortunately, Harry's Girl suffered a fatal injury during the Queen Mary Stakes," a statement said.

"Our thoughts go out to all connections at this time."

Harry's Girl, ridden by Sean Levey, was running in her third race, having previously finished first and second.

The race was won by 9-4 favourite True Love, under Ryan Moore for trainer Aidan O'Brien, from 100-1 shot Flowerhead.

Meanwhile My Cloud, the 3-1 favourite ridden by Silvestre de Sousa for trainer Roger Varian, was the shortest-priced winner in the history of the Royal Hunt Cup.

Irish trainer Paddy Twomey celebrated his first Royal Ascot winner as unbeaten Carmers won the Queen's Vase for a third success on the trot.

Victory completed a rare treble for jockey Billy Lee, who had also secured victories at Cheltenham and Aintree within the last seven months.

The Princess of Wales pulled out of a planned appearance at the course on Wednesday.

Catherine, who is making a gradual return to public life after her cancer diagnosis last year, is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public engagements, according to royal sources.

King Charles and Queen Camilla had hoped for a winner with Rainbows Edge, but despite being sent off favourite, he could not match Miss Information.

Winning jockey Oisin Murphy punched the air before hitting the finishing line on Andrew Balding's runner.

The royal couple were also out of luck with their contender on Tuesday - Reaching High finished ninth in the Ascot Stakes.

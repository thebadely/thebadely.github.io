According to new developments, Ella Toone helped England to back-to-back Euros titles

England midfielder Ella Toone says she is "really proud" to inspire people to take up running after joining Couch to 5K as its newest celebrity coach.

Toone, who was part of the Lionesses' European Championship-winning team in 2022 and 2025, is the latest motivational voice on the free beginner-friendly running plan from BBC Sport and the government's Department of Health and Social Care. 

The 26-year-old Manchester United player is the first new coach to join since 2022. 

Toone said she is hoping to encourage her friends to get back into exercise, in particular one friend who has just had a baby.

"Before the baby, she was all over running and enjoyed it," Toone said. "But since having the baby, I think it's the last thing she wants to think about. 

"It'll be nice for her to hear a familiar voice and someone who can motivate her to get out and run a 5k.

"There will be a lot of family and friends using my voice. Well, I hope so anyway, for as long as they can listen to me telling them what to do."

Toone said she was "buzzing" to use her platform to help people start their exercise journeys. 

"I feel like right now I'm an inspiration to a lot of young girls, so it's nice to try and help other people start running," said Toone, who joins a line-up of motivational voices that include BBC presenter Jo Whiley, comedian Sarah Millican, and former athletes Steve Cram and Denise Lewis. 

"For me I do that every day, so they know that I'm not telling them to do something I don't do."

Toone added it can be "really hard" to find motivation. 

"I think sometimes it's really difficult to get out there and go, but the feeling you get after doing it is more important," she said.

Since the death of her father in September last year, Toone has been open when talking about the impact of the loss on her.

She said it was important for her to give back to the NHS after what her family went though with her father.

"I know what a massive part the NHS were in dad's illness," she said. 

"Everything they do for families and people who aren't well, they were massive and we couldn't say anything more to them when we were in that situation."

While looking forward to motivating others, Toone also reflected on those who inspire her and she did not have to look any further than her England team-mates. 

"It helps when someone is enthusiastic and motivating, you can't listen to someone who isn't going to get you pumped up," she said when asked who her dream coach would be. 

"Lucy Bronze would be really motivating and really get the best out of you and get you pumped up for every session. I think Leah Williamson has a really nice voice for it. 

"If I'm going for motivation I'm going for Lucy. She's someone who's very fit and works so hard. She's a good person to listen to because you know she'd be doing it too.

"You know she gives absolutely everything every time she steps on the pitch."

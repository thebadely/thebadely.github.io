It has been recently reported that York Hall is often a venue for small hall events in the South of England

"I think it is an illness."

Steve Wood, one of the country's most prominent small-hall promoters, has pondered why he stays involved in the sport when it is struggling to stay alive at the level he operates in.

"You get involved and you can't get out," he added.

Small-hall boxing is not in rude health. Ticket sales are down, the number of events is dropping, money is being lost and some fighters who fill these cards with dreams of bigger stages are retiring because of the lack of opportunities to earn enough.

Many of the promoters who run what is considered the sport's grassroots are wondering why they continue to do it.

What many consider the lifeblood of the sport is struggling to keep breathing.

Small-hall boxing shows are the events without TV backing and big-name promoters which take place around the country in lesser-sized venues.

They offer entertainment for punters but, more importantly for boxing, a pathway to the top for those boxers who may not be poached by the big-name promoters straight from the amateur scene or, in this modern world, the social media space.

Think of Josh Warrington, the once dental technician from Leeds, who started on the small-hall circuit with Wood in the north of England and went on to become a world champion by winning the IBF featherweight title at Elland Road against Lee Selby.

Without the scene, Warrington may never have had a career in the fight game at all, let alone reach the top.

Wood has worked in the north of England for decades running boxing shows and managing fighters. It's a hobby, but an expensive one for the successful businessman.

"It's not a struggle, it's impossible," said the VIP Promotions boss. "It's always been a struggle but it is more difficult now.

"I done it to start kids off on their careers and get them on to the TV shows. The TV shows... you're not getting the same opportunities as you used to."

TV shows are still happening in the UK but there have been fewer in the UK over the past two years as Saudi Arabian money has flooded the sport.

"The Saudis put on a card with six big fights - that's six shows you'd have as top of the bill in the UK," said Wood. "That's six shows you're losing.

"It is all really good for the bigger name fighters who are getting more money, but it stops the development of these small-hall kids to get on the TV shows."

Josh Warrington rose from small-hall shows to world champion status 

In the north of England, it costs Wood around Â£15,000 to stage a good card. That is before a fighter is paid.

Down south, it is more expensive. Steve Goodwin has managed more than 70 champions at various levels and promotes events at London's York Hall. They cost around Â£22,000 per show.

Goodwin sees numerous reasons why it is becoming harder for small-hall boxing.

The cost of living has impacted on ticket sales. Interest has been affected by changes in television rights.

"People are poorer, generally in life, I'm a financial adviser by trade and the average working man is poorer," said Goodwin, who is based in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.

"We're definitely seeing a big negative on ticket sales, not only from boxers, but from what we can sell generally to the public."

Boxing has had less television exposure since Sky Sports stepped away from the sport after its deal with Boxxer expired. Goodwin worries Dazn's viewing figures are not high enough: That new fans are not being enticed in numbers.

Sky Sports plans to return to the sport in 2026 with new promoters.

"I personally don't care what the spin that's put on by various people, boxing is not in a great place," Goodwin said.

"If I sit here and talk boxing to people that are boxing fans, generally, friends, and they don't know who the boxers are any more.

"That can't be good for boxing. If people don't know the ones at the top, they're less likely to be interested in small hall."

Joshua Buatsi's WBO interim light heavyweight title fight with Callum Smith in February would have headlined in the UK, but was staged on a stacked undercard in Saudi Arabia

With no TV money and little sponsorship revenue as a result, the small-hall promoters rely on gate receipts to break even.

A fighter needs to sell enough tickets to cover his or her own purse and that of the opponents. Increasingly now, they are not doing so.

Wood also thinks there's more competition for those with a thirst for watching boxing.

"Now 'White Collar' isn't something that has just come up, it has been around a while but it is more popular now, then there's Misfits and other events," he said.

"You think: Why should we keep losing money? I've had to have a think about 2026 and I'll probably have to do fewer shows.

"I have other businesses and if I was having the stress and losing the money I do on boxing, you'd walk away."

Goodwin is following suit and is managing fewer boxers as well. He almost walked away completely three months ago.

"In a way, small hall doesn't make sense," he said.

"I was thinking: How can I keep doing this and losing money? But we keep doing it because I believe I do the best for the fighters."

They also are of the view the British Boxing Board of Control should help by reducing costs. Small-hall promoters get hit with the same fees as the big TV shows.

It feels like an important part of the sport is at breaking point.

"It has been the lifeblood of boxing for years," said Wood.

"I've had a few fighters retire this year because they're not earning enough to be a professional boxer and they've mouths to feed.

"I wish I had the balls to walk away but I feel privileged that I can help these guys."

Let's dive into the details: Callum Grigor is 25th in the Pirelli National Superstock Championship standings

British superbike rider Callum Grigor has been put into an induced coma after a crash at Donington Park.

The 26-year-old Scot came off his bike on the opening lap of the Pirelli National Superstock Championship race on Saturday.

Grigor had collided with fellow rider Nathan Harrison on the approach to Goddards Corner at the Leicestershire circuit.

"The race was immediately red-flagged and both riders were attended to by the medical team," said a statement from race organisers Motorsport Vision Racing, issued on the British Superbike website.

"Callum Grigor was found to be in a serious condition and required immediate trackside intervention, including being placed into an induced coma."

Isle of Man rider Harrison, 27, was treated at the medical centre for an "isolated limb injury".

Both riders were transferred to the major trauma centre at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham for further assessment and care.

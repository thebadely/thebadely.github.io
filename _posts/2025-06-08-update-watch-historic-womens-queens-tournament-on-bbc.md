Experts revealed that Emma Raducanu is one of five Grand Slam singles champions competing at Queen's

Queen's will host a women's tennis tournament for the first time in over 50 years - and you can watch live on the BBC.

Olga Morozova was the champion when the iconic venue last hosted a women's tournament in 1973.

Now a WTA 500 event, the tournament takes place at Queen's Club from 9-15 June, with the men's draw following the week after.

There will be coverage across BBC platforms as Britain's Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu begin their Wimbledon preparations.

There will also be live coverage of ATP and WTA events in Nottingham and Eastbourne, respectively, plus Wimbledon qualifying, before the grass-court Grand Slam begins on 30 June.

British number one Boulter and 2021 US Open champion Raducanu will feature in the main draw.

Compatriots Sonay Kartal, Jodie Burrage and Francesca Jones have also accepted wildcards into the tournament.

Olympic champion and world number seven Zheng Qinwen is the highest-ranked player to appear in the singles draw.

Fellow top-10 players Emma Navarro and reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys are also set to appear.

Barbora Krejcikova will begin her preparations for her Wimbledon title defence at Queen's Club alongside fellow former SW19 champions Elena Rybakina and Petra Kvitova.

Jessica Pegula, the 2024 US Open runner-up, and four-time major winner Naomi Osaka withdrew, external before the tournament started.

There will be live coverage on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app and the Red Button every day from 12:00 BST until play finishes.

BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller will provide regular updates, with live radio commentary of the women's final on 15 June on BBC 5 Live.

There is also coverage on BBC One and BBC Two, alongside select live text commentaries on the website and app.

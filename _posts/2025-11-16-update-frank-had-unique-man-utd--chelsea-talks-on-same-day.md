According to new developments, Thomas Frank joined Tottenham in June 2025 from Brentford

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank says he had talks with both Chelsea and Manchester United on the same day last year.

Frank met with Sir Jim Ratcliffe in the United co-owner's garage before speaking to Chelsea at a hotel in London in May 2024.

United stuck with then-manager Erik ten Hag before hiring Ruben Amorim in November 2024, while Chelsea appointed Enzo Maresca.

Frank, 52, stayed with Brentford for another season before joining Tottenham in June 2025.

The Dane is releasing a new book and says that day was a surreal experience.

"Sitting down for interviews with two of the 10 biggest clubs in the world â two hours apart â is pretty unique," he told TV 2 Sport., external

"I know I didn't get either of the two jobs, but it was still a huge deal.

"I remember walking through Battersea Park between the two interviews and thinking: 'Thomas Frank from Frederiksvaerk - am I really experiencing this?'"

Frank guided the Bees to two top-10 finishes in the Premier League and has Tottenham in fifth place after 11 games.

He says his seven years in charge at Brentford were 'unique' and admits he is facing a new challenge with Tottenham.

"I have repeatedly said that when we look back on our time at Brentford, it may be the best time of our football careers because the atmosphere we created together between the squad and the staff was unique," he said.

"Right now, I have a crazy job and a crazy challenge

"It's so much head down, 24-7, 365, and just focusing on winning and moving things forward."

Tottenham are back in action in the north London derby against rivals Arsenal on Sunday 23 November.

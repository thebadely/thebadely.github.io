It has been recently reported that Ombudsman has won two Group 1 races after also topping the field in the Prince of Wales Stakes at Royal Ascot in June

Ombudsman came out on top in his highly-anticipated rematch with Delacroix to win the Juddmonte International Stakes.

Delacroix pipped Ombudsman to the post in the Coral-Eclipse at Sandown in July but the roles were reversed at York.

Birr Castle, who went off at 150-1, made an early break and led by 20 lengths but was chased down by Ombudsman under William Buick and had to settle for third.

"This horse put in an amazing performance - unbelievable," Buick told ITV.

"I'm delighted with him. He's a very, very special horse and he showed all his attributes today."

The 7-4 favourite, trained by John and Thady Gosden, won by three and a half lengths from Delacroix.

Earlier, Derby winner Lambourn could only finish fifth as Pride Of Arras, returning to the scene of his Dante Stakes win, took the Great Voltigeur Stakes.

The Ralph Beckett-trained Pride Of Arras is aiming to get his career back on track after finishing last at the Curragh in the Irish Derby and 17th of 18 in the Derby at Epsom over the summer.

Lambourn won both of those races, having also claimed victory in Chester in May, and went off as the 4-5 favourite but was unable to make it four on the bounce.

Jockey Rossa Ryan remained patient throughout on Pride Of Arras before moving past Carmers, who finished second, with a furlong to go.

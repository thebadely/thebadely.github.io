Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Carlos Alcaraz is looking to win Wimbledon for the third year in a row

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz kept himself on course for a third Wimbledon title in a row by overcoming Jan-Lennard Struff in an enthralling encounter to reach the fourth round.

The world number two has yet to really hit his stride at the tournament but came through some big pressure situations and produced moments of quality in this match to seal a 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-4 win.

Alcaraz will next face 14th seed Andrey Rublev - who beat Adrian Mannarino 7-5 6-2 6-3 - for a place in the quarter-finals.

"I knew it was going to be difficult," the 22-year-old Spaniard said.

"He has big serves, approaches the net and I am really pleased with everything I had done today. 

"I am proud to get the win in four sets. It was stressful as well. I was suffering in every set that I did today."

Alcaraz had to battle through five sets and almost five hours on court to see off Fabio Fognini in the opening round and, although he did then beat British wildcard Ollie Tarvet in straight sets, he had to fend off a number of chances the Wimbledon debutant had to break him.

Initially, it looked like he would sail past world number 125 Struff in front of an expectant Centre Court crowd on Friday as he wrapped up the opening set in under 30 minutes, dropping just one game to the German.

But the second set was a different story as Struff found his power and accuracy on his serve. Having not managed a single ace in the first set, he hit four in the second to help him break Alcaraz twice and level up matters.

But that accuracy deserted the German number three early in the third. Three double faults gifted Alcaraz a break to go 2-0 up and he stayed in control to take the set.

The pressure ramped up in the fourth but Alcaraz showed the quality that has allowed him to go 21 matches unbeaten.

He fended off a couple of potential break opportunities before a wonderful backhand volley at the net helped him on the way to a crucial break at 4-4.

That had the Centre Court crowd up on their feet before Alcaraz wrapped up the set and the match with a dominant hold to love to cement his place in the next round.

Taylor Fritz must not want to be anywhere else but on court at Wimbledon, given how long his matches have been.

All three of his matches have lasted more than three hours - in his latest epic, he beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 6-1.

The American did at least get it done in four sets rather than the two five-set marathons that preceded it.

"I wouldn't be surprised if I'm a bit sore after this match, because even though it was four, it was much more physical than my other two matches," he said.

"I did a lot more side-to-side running in the heat as well. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm a bit sore. But overall I'm feeling good."

He will next face Australian Jordan Thompson in the last 16.

Thompson, who had never reached this stage of Wimbledon before, beat Italian Luciano Darderi 6-4 6-4 3-6 6-3.

Exciting Brazil teenager Joao Fonseca - who has had a huge backing of fans at Wimbledon - lost an all-South American encounter with Nicolas Jarry 6-3 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-4). The Chilean next faces Britain's Cameron Norrie.

Jarry has a family connection to Wimbledon - his grandfather, Jaime Fillol, reached the fourth round in 1974 - and he says he has loved the tournament since he was a child.

"I came here with him when I was 10 and 11 years old and since then I'm in love with this tournament," he said.

"Every match that I win here makes me stay here a couple more days and that makes me very happy."

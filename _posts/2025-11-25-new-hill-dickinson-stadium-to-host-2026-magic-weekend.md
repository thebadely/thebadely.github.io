Experts revealed that More than 52,000 people watched Australia beat England 14-4 at Hill Dickinson Stadium earlier this month

Everton FC's Hill Dickinson Stadium will host Super League's Magic Weekend for the first time in 2026.

The venue opened earlier this year and hosted the second Test of the recent Ashes series between England and Australia, which Australia won 14-4 in front of a sell-out crowd of 52,106.

Newcastle United's St James' Park hosted Magic Weekend for an eighth time in 2025 and the annual event will be staged in Liverpool for a second time next year, after Anfield hosted it in 2019.

Six Super League matches will be played as part of Magic Weekend across 4-5 July.

Newly promoted York will make their first Magic Weekend appearance in Saturday's opening match against Huddersfield, before champions Hull KR play city rivals Hull FC and Leigh take on Warrington.

On Sunday, Wakefield will face Castleford and Leeds will play Bradford Bulls at the event for the first time since 2012, before the action concludes with another derby between Wigan and St Helens.

There are also plans for a dedicated Magic fixture between Catalans Dragons and Toulouse to be played at a neutral venue in France.

"With memories still fresh of an unforgettable occasion for the Ashes Test, we're delighted to be able to confirm a return to Hill Dickinson Stadium for the 2026 Super League Magic Weekend," Rhodri Jones, Rugby League Commercial managing director, said.

"This will be the seventh venue to stage Magic since it was introduced as a new concept for sport in 2007 and our clubs, players and supporters are in for a treat.

"It's a stunning stadium with outstanding facilities at all levels and also superbly located for summer on the waterfront, and with the many and varied attractions of Liverpool within easy reach.

"We continue to work with the Dragons and Toulouse on the feasibility of delivering a very special event in France too and we hope to be able to announce something in the near future on this."

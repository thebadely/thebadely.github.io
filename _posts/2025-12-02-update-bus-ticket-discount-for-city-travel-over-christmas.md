According to new developments, Discounted bus tickets are in place for people travelling across Hull over Christmas.

The Hull Bus Alliance announced a group travel discount which started on Monday and will end on 31 December.

Stagecoach East Midlands and East Yorkshire Buses are offering the Hull Card Group ticket for up to five people for £7. It is usually priced at £14.90.

Councillor Mark Ieronimo, cabinet portfolio holder for transport and infrastructure at Hull City Council, said the scheme would help with the cost of living and "tackle issues of congestion".

The ticket can be used an unlimited number of times on Stagecoach or East Yorkshire buses in Hull on the day of purchase.

Ben Gilligan, managing director at East Yorkshire Buses, said: "This will allow families and friends to choose the sustainable option and avoid the frustration of sitting in traffic and paying for parking whilst also receiving excellent value bus travel."

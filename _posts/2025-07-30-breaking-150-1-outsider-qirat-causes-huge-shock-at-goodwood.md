Here’s what you need to know: Qirat, who was supplemented last week for Â£70,000, won at odds of 150-1

Qirat held off a late charge from Rosallion to emerge as a shock 150-1 winner in the Sussex Stakes on the second day of Glorious Goodwood.

The Ralph Beckett-trained four-year-old, who was included in the mile race as the pacemaker for 1-3 on favourite Field Of Gold, took an early lead, but was overhauled by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Serengeti.

Qirat regained the lead and finished a neck clear of Rosallion to land a massive upset.

It was the biggest-priced success of modern times in a British Group One race, with Sole Power - at 100-1 in the 2010 Nunthorpe Stakes - the only other three-figure priced top-level winner in the 21st century.

Qirat was only entered last week for Â£70,000 to help St James's Palace Stakes and Irish 2,000 Guineas winner Field Of Gold.

"It's turning into a cracking year," jockey Richard Kingscote told ITV.

"Ultimately, we were there as a helping hand to go an even gallop and we were somewhat ignored early, then took a lead off Wayne [Lordan on Serengeti].

"This horse likes the track and Ralph said even though we're here to help, he can do his best.

"I feel like a villain, but when I saw it wasn't a grey nose coming towards me, I kept going."

Trainer Beckett added: "He is a real Goodwood specialist and Richard is very good in this role."

Henri Matisse took third in the Â£1m race, while the John and Thady Gosden-trained Field Of Gold laboured to a fourth-placed finish.

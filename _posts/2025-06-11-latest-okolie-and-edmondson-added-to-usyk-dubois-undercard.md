It has been recently reported that Lawrence Okolie (left) wants to be a two-weight world champion

Britons Lawrence Okolie and Lewis Edmondson have been added to the undercard of Daniel Dubois' undisputed world heavyweight title fight with Oleksandr Usyk on 19 July at Wembley Stadium.

Okolie, 32, fights seasoned heavyweight contender Kevin Lerena while 29-year-old Edmondson faces Daniel Lapin at light-heavyweight.

Both contests will be over 12 rounds and are the first undercard bouts to be added to the Usyk-Dubois 2 undercard.

Okolie continues his run at heavyweight having moved up to the weight last December after being a world champion at cruiserweight.

The Londoner must move quickly if he is prove himself a world title contender, with the heavyweight division stacked with impressive talent waiting for their shot at belts.

South Africa's Lerena, 33, has 31 wins and three losses in his career while Okolie has a 21-1 record.

Dubois aims to become the first British heavyweight to hold all four major world titles in the four-belt era, while Usyk aims to become undisputed heavyweight champion for the second time.

Edmondson, the Commonwealth and British light-heavyweight champion, faces  Lapin with both undefeated in 11 fights. The Ukrainian often trains with Usyk.

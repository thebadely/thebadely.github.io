According to new developments, Over the next couple of weeks, hundreds of thousands of new students will descend on universities around the country.

For many, this will mark the start of a brand new adventure - though one often filled with a lot of worry.

To help with nerves, BBC News asked for tips from 2024's first-years, who've already sussed out being freshers.

From balancing studies and social life, to looking after your mental health and the importance of doing the washing up, this is what the class of 2024 have to say to the new kids on the block.

Edith Adam says she was "terrified" when she moved to Liverpool last year to study medicine.

What she hadn't realised at the time was that other freshers were just as scared as she was.

"I was absolutely terrified about not being able to make friends or that people wouldn't like me," says Edith, who's now going into her second year.

"I wish I had understood everyone else was terrified, and that they appreciate it when you go up to them and say hi."

Having never been to Liverpool before - a city with a party reputation - Edith worried she might not fit in.

"I was really scared of being ostracised for not wanting to go clubbing every night and not being a drinker," she says.

But Edith was still able to find her people.

"No one actually cares. There are plenty of things you can do that don't revolve around late nights. Just find what works for you."

The 24-year-old, from Huddersfield, says her advice would be not to put too much importance on the infamous freshers' week.

"I think everyone goes in with the expectation that it's this amazing, wild week, where you meet your best friends for life and have your best time at uni," she says.

And her top tip for staying friends with your flatmates?

"If it takes less than two minutes, just do it," Edith says. "It's so easy for everything to pile up, and then you don't wash your plates for five days, and all of a sudden everything is dirty and you have no cutlery - and your flatmates hate you."

But what if you can't make freshers week?

This is the situation Konstantin Schmidt faced last year, after issues with his visa delayed his start at Greenwich University by five weeks.

Although people told him the freshers parties he'd missed out on were "fun", the mechanical engineering student says he still managed to settle in well by joining up to student clubs.

"Societies are the best way to find people who share the same passion," Konstantin says.

Joining both a volleyball society and the Formula One society, he says he had positive interactions right from the off.

"The second I joined the room the members saw I was new and instantly included me," Konstantin says. "I also met new people through volleyball who were on my course who quickly became my friends."

The 21-year-old bonded with his flatmates by exploring each other's culture through food and music.

In his first weeks, Konstantin, who's from Bavaria in Germany, made Sp√§tzle - a pasta dish topped with grilled cheese for a dinner party with his flatmates.

"Everyone really liked" his food, he says - but he admits the best dish was a Filipino one made by his flatmate, Kai.

"It helped us understand everyone's culture even better," Konstantin says.

While many people starting university will be living away for the first time, some students still live at home.

Commuting more than an hour each way between Glasgow and Edinburgh, Rebecca can relate.

"If they forget something, my friends can just nip back to their accommodation, whereas I can't, " she says. "But it's not bad, I like commuting in."

Going into her second year of a business management course, Rebecca is now much more organised and comfortable with the journey, after experiencing some hiccups in her first year.

In some cases, cancelled trains meant she had to pay for a taxi all the way to Edinburgh.

"In second year I will definitely be checking my trains," Rebecca says.

Her advice for freshers is simple: "Make sure your bag is fully packed with everything you might need - and plan your commute."

Rebecca's university experience has been different from many others as she was only 16 when she started her course.

"I thought everyone was going to be older and not want to speak to me," she says. "But it wasn't like that at all. The age gap doesn't really matter."

Now 17, Rebecca is still waiting to experience a full freshers' week, but says she was still able to attend under-18 events.

Her advice for those in a similar position?

"Don't be afraid to ask for help," she says. "I felt like I couldn't ask for help because people would think I didn't deserve to be there because I'm younger.

"They don't care that you're 16 or 17. Just ask for help."

As the first in her family to go to university, Tian Liu didn't know what to expect before she started her combined honours degree in social sciences.

"I did so much research, but I still felt so unprepared," Tian says. "University is definitely a roller coaster. There was a point I wanted to drop out, but now I can definitely see the fruits of my labour."

Now going into her second year, the 19-year-old has found a better balance and would advise incoming students to look after their mental health.

"With tuition fees rising there is such a pressure to make the most out of it, but you can burn out," Tian says. "University is as much as you make of it, but give yourself grace.

"Have close friends who can act as support and accountability if you are doing too much, and use pastoral teams that the university offers," she adds.

"There is no need to rush, it's all a constant learning curve."

One year on from moving to Durham from Leeds, Tian is in New York completing an internship she got through her university - something she "could never have imagined" last year.

Her advice for incoming students?

"Don't disqualify yourself from anything. Be your biggest cheerleader. And take so many photos."

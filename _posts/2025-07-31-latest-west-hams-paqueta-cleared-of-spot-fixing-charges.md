Experts revealed that Lucas Paqueta joined West Ham from Lyon in 2022

West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission - almost two years after the Football Association launched an investigation into him.

The FA started their investigation in August 2023 and the Brazil international was charged in May last year for allegedly getting booked deliberately "for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market".

Paqueta, 27, was facing the prospect of a lifetime ban if found guilty.

The four charges against him related to a Premier League game against Leicester City on 12 November 2022, as well as 2023 fixtures against Aston Villa on 12 March, Leeds United on 21 May and Bournemouth on 12 August.

The regulatory commission found these four charges to be "not proven" following the hearing.

Paqueta was also charged with two counts of failing to co-operate with the investigation after breaching "FA Rule F3 in respect of alleged failures to comply pursuant to FA Rule F2", which relates to providing information and documents.

He also denied these charges, but the regulatory commission found them to be proven and will "decide an appropriate sanction for these breaches at the earliest opportunity".

"Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations," said Paqueta.

"I can't say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face.

"To my wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham United, to the fans who always cheered me on, and to my family, friends and the legal team who have supported me - thank you for everything."

Paqueta's lawyer, Alastair Campbell, told BBC Radio 5 Live his client is "very emotional and very delighted" and has "an enormous weight off his chest".

The former AC Milan and Lyon player scored four goals in 33 Premier League appearances for West Ham during the 2024-25 season.

Paqueta was in tears after being booked against Tottenham in May, with his wife Maria Fournier saying in an Instagram post on the same evening they had "been living this nightmare for two years".

After being charged by the FA last year, he said he was "extremely surprised and upset".

Paqueta joined the Hammers from Lyon for an initial Â£36.5m in August 2022 and helped the club win the Europa Conference League during his debut season.

He was reportedly set for a Â£85m move to Manchester City, external in August 2023 before the FA investigation came to light.

Campbell said there "certainly" could be legal implications regarding the collapse of that possible "dream move", but added they will wait for the full written reasons before deciding whether to take any action.

West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady said the club are "pleased" by the verdict and "resolutely stood by" Paqueta throughout the process.

She added: "It has been a difficult time for Lucas and his family, but he has remained absolutely professional throughout and he is now looking forward to drawing a line under this episode, as is everyone at West Ham United."

The FA said it is awaiting the written reasons from the regulatory commission and "will not be commenting further until that time".

Since 2014, FA rules have stated anyone associated with a club in the top eight tiers of English football cannot bet on any aspect of the sport worldwide.

Several high-profile names have received suspensions of varying lengths for breaching these rules.

England striker Ivan Toney, now with Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahli, was suspended for eight months in 2023 for 232 breaches between 2017 and 2021, when he represented Scunthorpe United, Wigan Athletic, Peterborough United and Brentford.

Last year, Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali was given a suspended two-month ban after admitting to placing between 40 and 50 bets after joining the club from AC Milan.

Former England defender Kieran Trippier was banned for 10 weeks in 2020 for giving out information for others to bet on his transfer from Tottenham to Atletico Madrid.

Harry Toffolo, who left Nottingham Forest after his contract expired last month, was also given a suspended five-month ban in 2023 after admitting 375 breaches of the FA's betting rules. 

In 2017, Joey Barton - then a Burnley player - was banned for 18 months, reduced to 13 on appeal, after admitting to have placed 1,260 football-related bets over a 10-year period.

Meanwhile, Stratford Town defender Kynan Isaac received a 10-year ban for his part in spot-fixing during an FA Cup tie against Shrewsbury Town in 2021.

Defender Bradley Wood also served a six-year ban from 2018 after deliberately getting booked twice during Lincoln City's run to the FA Cup quarter-finals in the 2016-17 season.

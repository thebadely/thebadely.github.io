Here’s what you need to know: Customers at a Lancashire cafe are being offered a 20% discount if they agree to leave their mobiles in a specially built "phone jail" during their visit.

Usman Hussain, who owns the Chaii Stop on St Paul's Road in Preston, wants the only buzz in his cafe to be that of lively conversations between friends, families and strangers.

He hopes the promise of discounted food and drinks will help tear people away from their electronic devices.

"The response has been amazing," said Usman. "People are laughing, challenging their friends and even filming the moment before they lock the phone away."

Usman said the cafe was "built for conversations, connections and good vibes so we thought let's make it fun to be present again".

The idea came from "a simple observation", he said.

"I'd just look around and see groups of families, friends, all sitting together, but every single person staring at their phone. 

"So we thought: How can we get everyone to connect again?'"

He told BBC Radio Lancashire that in just a few days "we've had students, families and couples tell us it's made their conversations feel more real, just like old times and it's become a talking point".

Three years ago, Usman said he would charge customers one of three prices at his cafe, depending on how well-mannered they were in placing their order.

"Politeness goes a long way," he said.

Visitor Mariam said she visits the cafe with her husband for breakfast.

She said: "We will have to think of something to talk about that isn't about our kids!

"One of us is often on the phone so the other usually ends up doing the same."

Farzana Jamidar said she likes the idea because "it's the only 10 minute break you get on your own, where you can actually think".

She added: "In that 10 minutes, I've probably got 10 missed calls."

"I think it's a brilliant idea," Raheela Hussain agreed.

"Putting it away for that time out is absolutely amazing.

"When we were growing up there were no phones, no wi-fi, nothing, so it brings you back to that time."

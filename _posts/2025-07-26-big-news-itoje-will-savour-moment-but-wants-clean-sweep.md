It has been recently reported that Maro Itoje has led the Lions to a first series victory since their 2013 win over Australia

Captain Maro Itoje is targeting a 3-0 clean sweep against Australia - but will first "savour the moment" of completing a Test series win over the Wallabies.

A dramatic 29-26 victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground gave the British and Irish Lions an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

It is the first time the Lions have won the first two Tests of a series since 1997 in South Africa.

The Saracens and England captain paid tribute to the "massive squad effort" and said the outcome is "what dreams are made of".

He added: "The first time we met, Faz [head coach Andy Farrell] made the call that he wanted us to come out here and win everything.

"Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely delighted with this result - but we want to go again next week.

"This is one of the moments of your life that you'll cherish. This will live long in the memory. 

"Often in sport, you have to move on and focus on the next challenge. No doubt we'll do that after a celebration. Every now and again, it's important to savour the moment."

In 1997, South Africa won the third Test 35-16 against a Lions side missing three of the key men in the opening two games - Keith Wood, Gregor Townsend and Tim Rodber.

The third Test will be played in Sydney on 2 August and Farrell said: "The plan [for the week ahead] will stay the same. Win or lose, we trust the plan ahead.

"We'll make sure we enjoy the night, that's for sure, because we've made a bit of history."

We showed what it takes to be a Lion - Farrell

The Lions were beaten in their opening warm-up match against Argentina in Dublin but have won all eight matches they have played on Australian soil.

That record was under serious threat when the Wallabies raced into a 23-5 lead in the first half, but Farrell's side fought back brilliantly before full-back Hugo Keenan crossed for a match-winning try in the final minute.

Should they avoid defeat in the final Test, it would be the first time a Lions team has been unbeaten overseas on a tour since 1974.

"You can see what it means to everyone," Farrell continued. "These lads have dreamed of being a British and Irish Lion all their lives.

"To get to the point where we come to the MCG, with 90,000 people, with a dramatic finish like that to win the series - it's what dreams are made of.

"It's a special moment for everyone and we're absolutely delighted that we showed the courage of what it takes to be a Lion and I'm delighted for everyone involved."

Keenan's 'special moment' seals series victory for Lions

A lingering calf injury, followed by a bout of illness, meant Ireland's Keenan experienced a stuttering start to the tour.

In his absence, Elliot Daly made a strong claim for the full-back jersey but the England international's tour-ending injury - and Blair Kinghorn's less serious knee problem - left the way clear for Keenan.

At the MCG, he wrote his name into Lions folklore as part of a dramatic finale.

"It's been a mad trip," he said. "It's not how I imagined it going, getting sick for two weeks and coming into camp a bit injured.

"It's been a rollercoaster, but I suppose these things happen for a reason, and thankfully I was in full health for the past two Tests.

"I'm delighted to be involved and delighted that we got the result. They're special moments, having our family and friends out on the pitch with us at the end. It's those moments you play rugby for and you dream of."

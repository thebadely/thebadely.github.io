Let's dive into the details: Shaun Murphy won the British Open and was runner-up at the Xi'an Grand Prix earlier this season

Fourteen-year-old Chinese amateur Wang Xinzhong almost caused a massive upset against Shaun Murphy before the reigning Masters champion prevailed in the deciding frame of their second-round match at the International Championship.

Murphy, the 2005 world champion, trailed 5-4 but won the final two frames with breaks of 72 and 89 to set up a third-round tie against fellow Englishman Elliot Slessor.

World number nine Murphy went 3-0 ahead but Wang levelled by winning the next three frames with breaks of 81, 100 and 58.

The teenager knocked in another century on his way to establishing a lead for the first time and he had a chance to wrap up victory in the 10th frame but missed a black off its spot early on.

Murphy capitalised and made two frame-winning contributions to secure victory.

Wang, who was given a wildcard into the event, defeated women's world champion Bai Yulu and world number 53 Robbie Williams on Sunday to reach round two in Nanjing, China.

He appeared in the International Championship in 2023 aged 12, losing 6-0 in the second round to Judd Trump on that occasion.

Elsewhere in the second round, Ronnie O'Sullivan lost the first two frames to world number 63 Sanderson Lam but then reeled off six in succession to wrap up a comfortable 6-2 win.

The seven-time world champion's opponent in the last 32 will be Jack Lisowski, who made four century breaks in a 6-4 victory over Louis Heathcote.

English left-hander Lisowski ended his 15-year wait for a ranking title by winning the Northern Ireland Open on 26 October.

China's Ding Junhui continued the defence of his International Championship crown with another dominant victory, following Sunday's 6-0 first-round success against David Grace with a 6-1 win over Michael Holt.

Ding has made six century breaks in the 13 frames he has played so far at the tournament.

English duo Judd Trump and Kyren Wilson, currently first and second in the world rankings, and China's world champion Zhao Xintong all made it through to round three with wins on Monday.

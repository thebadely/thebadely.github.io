Hereâ€™s what you need to know: TV presenter Emma Willis has been announced as the new patron of a hospital and charity. 

Willis said accepting the role at Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital and Charity was "a dream come true". 

The Birmingham-born star, known for presenting shows including Love is Blind, The Voice and Delivering Babies, has supported the children's hospital for more than a decade, the trust said. 

Her new role will see her champion both hospitals, raise awareness and help to secure funds for treatment, research and patient care. 

She joins Ben Francis, founder of UK sportswear brand Gymshark, as the hospital and charity's second patron.

Willis said: "I've known for a long time how special Birmingham Children's Hospital is after it saved the life of one of my oldest friend's sons." 

She said she had accepted the position "without hesitation".

"I've never been asked to be a patron before, so it was an incredibly proud moment for me and my family," Willis said. 

"I'm keen to get stuck in and help raise awareness of the hospitals' life-saving impact as well as the vital funds it needs to go above and beyond for patients."

She called the hospitals' impact "truly inspirational", adding "I'm delighted to combine my love for the Children's with my passion for women's health and maternity services". 

The trust said Birmingham Women's Hospital ran the busiest maternity unit in the country, with around 8,200 births annually, while Birmingham Children's Hospital is home to Europe's largest paediatric intensive care unit.

Mark Brider, chief executive of the hospital charity, said they were "thrilled and deeply honoured" to welcome her as patron.

He said: "Her passion for our patients brings joy every time she visits. With her inspiring support, we'll be able to amplify our impact even further."

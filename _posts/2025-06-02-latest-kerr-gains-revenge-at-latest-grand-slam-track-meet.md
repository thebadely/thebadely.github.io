Here’s what you need to know: Josh Kerr's 1500m win was not quite enough to secure his second Grand Slam Track title

Great Britain's Josh Kerr avenged his Olympic 1500m defeat by Cole Hocker in a thrilling battle in Sunday's Grand Slam Track meet.

Hocker surged past Kerr, 27, to claim a shock victory and Olympic gold in Paris last August.

But it was Kerr's turn to produce a decisive finish in Philadelphia, storming past the American in the final few metres to win by seven-hundredths of a second.

Kerr claimed victory in a season's best time of three minutes 34.44 seconds.

After a fifth-placed finish in the 800m on Saturday, Kerr missed out on the top prize of $100,000 (Â£74,000) for the short distance group by just one point to Canada's Marco Arop, who won the 800m.

In the women's 100m, US sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden clocked a world-leading time as she stormed to an emphatic victory.

The Olympic bronze medallist, 24, claimed victory in a personal best 10.73secs, making her the 10th fastest woman to run the distance, tied with France's Christine Arron.

"It means everything, I've been working so hard for this," said Jefferson-Wooden, who also won the 200m on Saturday. "It's just all coming together."

Compatriot Tamari Davis placed second in 11.03secs, with Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith fifth in 11.16secs.

Grand Slam Track - what is it and what does it mean for athletics?

GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith clinched the top prize for the men's long sprints group  for the second time in three meets.

After winning the 400m in 44.51 on Saturday, the 30-year-old's fifth-place finish in the 200m was enough to claim another Grand Slam title, having secured the first in Kingston, Jamaica.

Grand Slam Track is a new competition created by Michael Johnson which aims to bring the world's fastest athletes together to compete for lucrative prizes.

Four events were scheduled for the opening series and the final meet will be in Los Angeles from 27-29 June.

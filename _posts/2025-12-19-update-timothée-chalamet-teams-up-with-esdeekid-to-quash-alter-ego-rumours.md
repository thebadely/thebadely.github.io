Here’s what you need to know: Timothée Chalamet has finally quashed rumours that he is cult anonymous rapper EsDeeKid - by performing alongside him in a new video.

Speculation has run riot that the Oscar-nominated US actor has been leading a double life as the masked rapper, who only ever reveals his eyes.

Some followers spotted an apparent resemblance with Chalamet's eyes, and when the BBC questioned the star about the connection earlier this week, he responded: "No comment... You'll see, all in due time."

Now, the actor - who adopted the hip-hop moniker Lil Timmy Tim in high school - has scotched the conspiracies by posting a video of himself rapping alongside EsDeeKid on a remix of the musician's top 40 hit 4Raws.

In the music video, Chalamet appeared to refer to the rumours by starting with only his eyes on show, like the drill artist, before pulling down the bandana from his face and dropping the bars: "It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryin' to stack $100 million."

He then referenced his partner Kylie Jenner with the line: "Girl got $1 billion."

The clip was filmed at Andover Minimarket Off Licence in north London, and was reposted by EsDeeKid.

The speculation has been seized upon by fans in recent weeks, and both sides stayed silent as EsDeeKid reached the UK top 10 and Chalamet promoted his new film.

BBC Radio One's Greg James also quizzed Chalamet in an interview this week about his connection to EsDeeKid, where he responded: "All will be revealed in due time." 

James updated his caption on social media overnight noting "all was revealed". 

He even gave the title, Marty Supreme, several shout-outs in the new collaboration, building on an already savvy marketing campaign for the film.

But it was always far-fetched that the two people could be one and the same, and that Chalamet could have pulled off rapping with EsDeeKid's Liverpudlian accent.

Their collaboration quickly went viral, with British rapper Central Cee replying "Naaa" with crying and laughing emojis, Tinie Tempah posting "Hahha this is sickkk" and US star Shaboozey declaring "This going #1".

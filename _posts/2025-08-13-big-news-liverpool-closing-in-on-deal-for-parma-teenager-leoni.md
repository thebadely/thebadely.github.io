Let's dive into the details: Giovanni Leoni began his career at Padova and also played for Sampdoria before joining Parma

Liverpool are closing in on the signing of 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of about Â£26m.

The centre-half has emerged as a key target for Arne Slot's side and is now set for a move to Anfield.

The Italy Under-19s international began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.

Liverpool could further bolster their defensive ranks and remain in talks with Crystal Palace for England centre-back Marc Guehi.

FA Cup winners Palace are believed to want Â£40m for their captain, who only has 12 months left on his contract, but Liverpool want to pay less than that.

Eagles chairman Steve Parish said earlier this week Guehi might be sold to avoid him moving on a free transfer next summer.

If the clubs do agree a deal, the level of playing time he would be afforded at Liverpool will be a crucial consideration for Guehi in a World Cup year.

The Reds have already spent about Â£270m this summer, though they have recouped about Â£170m through player sales.

They have also had a Â£110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle, though sources have told BBC Sport the Swede remains determined to move to the Premier League champions.

Signing Leoni, Guehi and Isak would take Liverpool's summer spending past Â£400m.

Giovanni Leoni is very strong in the air. He's a technically gifted player as well. He can come out from defence and start building from the back, but he's obviously at his most impactful in the air. He's improved a lot in that area too.

A couple of big clubs in Italy, including AC Milan and Inter Milan, were also after him. So I didn't expect a bold move from a Premier League club so early, to be honest. But Liverpool put the money on the table - probably even a bit more than Parma were originally asking for.

Who wouldn't fancy playing Anfield? I think any player would be happy to join Liverpool - and, of course, the Premier League, which is the most entertaining and attractive league in the world right now.

I would have loved to see Giovanni join a big Italian club before moving abroad. But that's football - the market is open. If a club like Liverpool comes in with 30m euros plus bonuses, it's difficult to turn down such an offer.

It will be difficult for him to start regularly - he knows that. But I don't think that's a major problem at his age.

Having the opportunity to be part of such a strong squad and play alongside great players, especially someone like Virgil van Dijk, is a huge opportunity.

According to new developments, Sheffield Wednesday have been deducted 12 points for entering administration

Sheffield Wednesday's administrators have said players and staff have received their full wages a day early, ending a lengthy pattern of monthly payment delays.

The Championship club were placed into administration and hit with a 12-point penalty last week after months of turmoil under owner Dejphon Chansiri.

In the days since, fans have ended a boycott of the club and Kris Wigfield, of administrators Begbies Traynor, said supporters had already spent more than Â£500,000 on tickets and in the club shop as of Monday.

Wage payments had been delayed in five of the seven months prior to administrators taking charge of the club and ending Chansiri's 10-year spell as owner.

"This marks a major step forward in stabilising the club's operations and rebuilding trust both internally and with our supporters," the Owls said in a statement., external

"We couldn't have achieved this without the incredible backing of you Wednesdayites.

"Your return to Hillsborough, the surge in merchandise and ticket sales, and your continued belief in the club have made this possible."

The points deduction means the Owls are bottom of the second tier on minus six points and are 16 points adrift of safety.

The Greenland national team suffered a huge setback in their quest to play official international matches when their recent application to join Concacaf, the governing body for football in North and Central America, was rejected.

BBC Sport has been in Greenland covering the Greenlandic Football Championship for the first time. A documentary on the events will be released later in 2025.

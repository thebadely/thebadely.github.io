Australia 12-21 Wales: Sean Lynn's side celebrate famous win in Brisbane

Women's summer series

Wales recorded their first win under head coach Sean Lynn with victory over Australia in Brisbane.

Having lost all five Six Nations games earlier this year, Wales delivered a timely performance just four weeks out from the Rugby World Cup.

Annabelle Codey gave the hosts an early lead before play was halted amid an impressive show of thunder and lightning on the Sunshine Coast.

Nel Metcalfe then crossed twice as Wales looked resurgent, but a lapse in concentration allowed Tabua Tuinakauvadra to sneak over on the stroke of half-time to trim Wales' lead to 14-12.

Hannah Dallavalle scored an opportunist try to extend Wales' advantage, and while the Wallaroos dominated territory in the second half, Wales' defence was up to the task.

The two sides will meet again in Sydney on Friday, their final warm-up before their World Cup openers in England.

Number eight Alex Callender was Wales' captain for the first time

It was the first time Wales had played on Australian soil and the performance, both in attack and defence, was hugely encouraging against a side ranked sixth in the world - four places above Wales. 

The Wallaroos fired a warning shot inside the opening minute when a delayed pass from fly-half Tia Hinds exposed the defence for Layne Morgan to score in the corner.

But green and gold celebrations were cut short when play was brought back for crossing in midfield, much to Wales' relief.

Australia continued to dominate and the opening try came five minutes later, this time through some patient forward play with Codey adding the finishing touch.

Wing Desiree Miller kicked the conversion, but the players were then rushed off the pitch as a storm arrived right on cue, and the 30-minute break gave Wales time to regroup.

They were resurgent on their return as they started to throw the ball around, and the breakthrough came after some solid set pieces put the Wallaroos under pressure.

In a move straight off the training field, Alex Callender picked up from the base of a solid scrum before Keira Bevan created space for full-back Metcalfe to charge through. Bevan kicked the conversion to tie the scores after 20 minutes.

Wales continued to live dangerously in defence as the hosts looked threatening, but Lleucu George and Metcalfe combined well to save what looked a certain try.

Wales then had a chance of their own, Metcalfe involved once again, but Donna Rose knocked on in greasy conditions with the try line in sight.

A five metre driving lineout gave Wales a good attacking platform towards the end of the half. Australia defended several pick-and-go attempts, and when Bevan had seen enough the ball went through the hands and found Metcalfe in space. 

Bevan's trusty boot looked to be sending Wales down the tunnel with a seven-point lead, but the Wallaroos had other ideas and headed up to the other end of the pitch and Tuinakauva was not to be denied.

The conversion was missed as Wales held on to a slender lead.

Wales' defence was given a stern test by the Wallaroos

While Wales' youngsters had shone in the first half, it was an older head who extended the lead after the break.

Former captain Hannah Jones, now playing under her married name Dallavalle, pounced onto a beautifully weighted kick from George who was quick to recognise there was no covering full-back.

Bevan was once again on target from the tee as Wales extended their lead.

But that proved one of very few visits to the Australian 22 as the Wallaroos dominated territory and possession in the second half.

Wales' defence was much improved though, exemplified by Callender who came up with a crucial turnover to prevent a try for Morgan, while fellow back-rower Bethan Lewis also put in a solid shift.

Seren Lockwood, Katherine Baverstock and Tilly Vucaj all came on to win their first caps in what was a memorable afternoon for Wales women.

Such was the emotion of the occasion, Welsh Rugby Union's head of women's rugby Belinda Moore was wiping away tears on the final whistle.

Hers were not the only tears as both Lynn and Callender came into the post-match press conference full of emotion.

Lynn proud of Wales after beating Australia

Australia head coach Jo Yapp said: "We're really disappointed, I genuinely don't feel that's a reflection of how we've been training as a group.

"Ultimately we didn't play the conditions. Wales played them better than we did, so credit to them. 

"We can't win Test matches if we can't look after the ball, we turned over way too much ball. We had a lot of possession and territory in that second half, we just couldn't look after the ball.

"We can't blame that [the lightning delay], it was the same for both sides, both teams had to deal with it."

Wales head coach Sean Lynn said: "I'm over the moon for the girls and the staff.

"We had a point to prove and the girls have done us all proud.

"I asked them to come in, set some targets and work hard for these eight weeks and it was lovely to see the performance. The performance was everything we asked it to be. It's something that we're going after.

"We're going to enjoy it, but we've got work on Monday ready for a six-day turnaround on Friday in Sydney."

Wakefield Trinity put in a classy performance to beat Castleford Tigers in the final 2025 Magic Weekend fixture at St James' Park.

Max Jowitt weaved his way through to send Trinity ahead and Caius Faatili ran in under the posts to continue their dominant start.

Josh Simm cut into Wakefield's lead just past the half-hour mark but Wakefield went in at the break on top off the back of Lachlan Walmsley's score.

Tom Johnstone received Mason Lino's kick to send Wakefield further in front, before Sam Wood went in for Cas, but Walmsley and Faatili both scored a second try, with Trinity's fifth win of the campaign never looking in doubt.

Wakefield went ahead courtesy of a training-ground move which saw Jake Trueman sent Jowitt through as he dummied his way into gaining the space to touch down and then go on to convert his own try.

Trinity went 12-0 ahead without much competition from Castleford courtesy of Faatili sailing in from a Mike McMeeken offload.

When Castleford did get on the board, they did so in impressive fashion - straight from a scrum they worked the ball wide to Simm, who did well to cut inside and find the space to dot down.

At that point the game was in the balance, but Walmsley's try, off the back of a looping ball to the wing, sent Trinity in with a commanding 12-point lead.

That advantage was extended in fine fashion after the break as Lino's last-ditch kick was perfectly placed for Johnstone to collect and ground with ease.

Despite their deficit, Castleford scored a classy try of their own on the hour mark as Rowan Milnes' kick bounced kindly for Jordan Dezaria, who fed Daejarn Asi to send Wood through to score.

Jowitt could have wrapped up the win for Wakefield as a result of an audacious move from Walmsley, but his kick was knocked on by Jowitt in the process of the Trinity full-back's attempt to go over.

Castleford did well to weather the storm, but Wakefield added another score to their tally, with Lino influential again to work the ball laterally to Walmsley to dive in, and Faatili added a second try of his own with a 70-metre run in, with Cas unable to catch him.

It was a disappointing showing by Castleford for much of the 80 minutes, as they slip to an eighth defeat from 10 Super League matches this term.

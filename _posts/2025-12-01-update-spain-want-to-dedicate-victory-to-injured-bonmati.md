Let's dive into the details: Aitana Bonmati has won 83 international caps for Spain

Spain manager Sonia Bermudez says her side want to retain their Women's Nations League title for injured midfielder Aitana Bonmati, who broke her leg in training.

The 27-year-old fell awkwardly during a practice session at the national team's training base in Madrid on Sunday.

Spain were preparing for the second leg of their Uefa Women's Nations League final against Germany at the Estadio Metropolitano on Tuesday.

Bonmati played 77 minutes of last Friday's first leg, which finished goalless, in Kaiserslautern.

"Aitana wanted to stay for the final and be with us," Bermudez said. 

"We told her she had to return to Barcelona to begin her recovery because, for us, the health of our players comes first. 

"We want to dedicate tomorrow's victory to her."

Spain captain Irene Paredes - who also plays alongside Bonmati at Barcelona - said: "Absences like Aitana's can unsettle you because no one likes seeing a team-mate hurt or injured.

"[Her] absence is a significant loss for the national team and for Barca as well. I personally didn't see what happened but she told me about it. 

"You could see the pain in her eyes and it was clear something serious had occurred. I'm sending her lots of encouragement and wishing her a full recovery, and we'll keep pushing,"

A statement from the Royal Spanish Football Federation said that "following tests carried out by the medical services" Bonmati was "diagnosed with a fracture in her left fibula".

Barcelona said they were waiting for her to return to the club so they can decide on treatment. 

The injury setback is a disappointing end to what has otherwise been a stellar year for the midfielder.

Bonmati became the first player to win the women's Ballon d'Or three times, achieved a domestic treble with Barca and reached the Euro 2025 final with Spain.

She was also named the Champions League's player of the season by Uefa.

Experts revealed that More than 80 Warm Welcome spaces have opened up across Surrey, allowing people to have a free hot drink and socialise with others during the colder months.

Community centres, church halls, and most of Surrey's libraries are among the venues being used for the Surrey County Council (SCC) initiative, which is now running for the fourth year. 

Residents can access these spaces, which aim to support those who are affected by cost of living pressures, between Saturday and the end of March. 

Councillor Mark Nuti, cabinet member for health, wellbeing and public health, said the aim was to "ensure that nobody needs to be sitting in a cold home feeling alone".

He said: "We know how important warmth and company is for people's health and wellbeing, and these spaces not only offer that but further help and advice should they need it.

"Everyone is welcome both young and old.  So, if you need a place to warm up from the cold, come along to any Warm Welcome – enjoy a free hot drink, friendly company or support, we would invite anyone to take up this offer."

More than 65,000 Surrey residents visited Warm Welcomes between November 2024 and March this year.

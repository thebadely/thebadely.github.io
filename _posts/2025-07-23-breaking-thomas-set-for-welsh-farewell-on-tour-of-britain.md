Let's dive into the details: Geraint Thomas won the Tour de France in 2018

Geraint Thomas will get the chance to bid farewell to cycling on home soil with Wales chosen to host the last two stages of the 2025 Lloyds Tour of Britain in September.

The Tour of Britain is expected to be the final race of former Tour de France winner and two-time Olympic champion Thomas' illustrious career.

Ineos rider Thomas, 39, will complete the final Tour de France of his career next weekend, but his final event is to reach a climax in his native south Wales.

It has been announced that the penultimate stage of the Tour of Britain, on Saturday, 6 September, will begin in Pontypool and take a route through Monmouthshire.

The sixth and final stage of the race will take place the following day and will start from the Geraint Thomas National Velodrome of Wales in Newport.

The route will then pass the Maindy Velodrome - home to the Maindy Flyers Cycling Club which produced Thomas â before ending in Cardiff city centre.

The Tour of Britain, which begins on 2 September, will start with two stages in Suffolk. There will also be legs in Bedfordshire and Warwickshire before the race arrives in Wales.

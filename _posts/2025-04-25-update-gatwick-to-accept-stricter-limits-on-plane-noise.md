Let's dive into the details: Gatwick Airport has said it will accept stricter limits on aircraft noise and has put forward what it called improved plans in response to the government's approval for a second runway.

Last month Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that she was "minded" to give consent for the airport to bring its second runway into use.

Gatwick has now responded to the Secretary of State's letter with what it called an "improved noise scheme for local residents."

The airport also said it accepts a requirement to have 54% of passengers using public transport before it brings the Northern Runway into operation - but it needs support.

Gatwick said it needs help from third parties, including the Department for Transport, to support delivery of the conditions and improvements required to meet the target. 

This would include reinstating the full Gatwick Express train service, the airport said.

It also said if the 54% public transport target is not achieved then an alternative cars-on-the-road limit should be met instead.

If neither the public transport mode share or the cars-on-the-road limit are met, then the second runway would be delayed until £350m of road improvements have been completed, it said.

The airport has also responded to the Secretary of State on a number of other matters including measures to strengthen sustainable design and reduce emissions.

Stewart Wingate, CEO of London Gatwick said: "This project represents a £2.2bn investment, fully funded by our shareholders and it is essential that any planning conditions enable us to make full use of the Northern Runway. 

"We are confident that our amended proposals will allow us to grow sustainably and meet passenger demand, while addressing the matters raised by the Secretary of State in her letter, including noise and environmental impacts."

The Secretary of State is expected to make a final decision by 27 October.

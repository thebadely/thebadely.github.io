Tommy Fleetwood will take a one-stroke lead into the final day of the St Jude Championship in Memphis after struggling early on during his third round.

He carded a one-under-par 69 to finish the day on 14 under par, one shot clear of fellow Englishman Justin Rose.

Fleetwood had held a three-shot lead over Rose after the second round was completed earlier on Saturday, play having been suspended overnight because of severe weather on Friday.

World number one Scottie Scheffler was six shots adrift after round two but is now only two back after firing a five-under 65, tied for the best round of the day with US Open champion JJ Spaun.

Fleetwood is a seven-time winner on the European Tour but is still waiting for his first PGA Tour title, with this event his 162nd start on the US circuit.

Rose, 45, is attempting to become the first player in his 40s to win on Tour this season.

"I enjoy being in this position," said Fleetwood. "The more I put myself there, the more chance there is of it happening. 

"[Sunday] might be my day, it might not, but being there is the most important thing."

The world number 15 lost his lead early in the third round following a double bogey at the par-five third and a bogey at the seventh.

That left Rose alone in the lead and he followed with a birdie at the seventh, but then found water at the ninth and made bogey while Fleetwood birdied the ninth to regain a share of the lead.

The 34-year-old went clear again with a 14-foot birdie putt at the 12th and claimed another birdie on the 16th.

He had a three-shot lead after 17 holes, but a bogey on the last allowed Rose to pull within one with a birdie.

Fleetwood has had five top-five finishes this season and was runner-up behind Keegan Bradley at the Travelers Championship in June.

Players who finish in the top 50 of the FedEx Cup standings after Sunday's round at TPC Southwind will advance to next week's BMW Championship - the second of the PGA Tour's three play-off tournaments.

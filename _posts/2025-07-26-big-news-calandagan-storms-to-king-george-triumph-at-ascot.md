It has been recently reported that Calandagan was claiming a sixth win from 12 career starts

French favourite Calandagan came from behind to pass Kalpana and win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.

Calandagan, ridden by Mickael Barzalona, provided trainer Francis-Henri Graffard with his second successive triumph after Goliath last year.

The 11-10 favourite's attitude was questioned after he lost out in a tight finish to Jan Brueghel in the Coronation Cup at Epsom last month but there was no doubting his resolution this time.

"I'm so pleased for this horse," said Graffard after Calandagan, running in the green and red colours of the Aga Khan, won by a length.

Jan Brueghel, trained by Aidan O'Brien, made the running at a steady pace before eventual runner-up Kalpana hit the front going to the final furlong. 

Rebel's Romance, who was  boxed in on the rail, finished third in the five-runner race.

Calandagan won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud last time out, having finished second in four consecutive top-level Group One races.

"I wanted to see my horse getting into his rhythm and lengthening his stride, when I really saw him coming I started to shout," said Graffard.

"He won nicely again today, he's a good horse, that's two in row now in Group Ones."

Despite her defeat, Andrew Balding's Kalpana is now general 8-1 favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October.

The King George is a highlight of  the Flat racing season and it was announced on Saturday the contest will become Britain's richest race next year with a prize fund of Â£2m.

Boasting a purse of Â£1.5m this year, along with the Derby at Epsom, its roll call of winners include greats such as Nijinsky, Shergar, Dancing Brave and Galileo.

The 2025 King George renewal was the 75th running of the race and came 50 years after Grundy beat Bustino in an epic billed as 'the race of the century'.

Let's dive into the details: Sarina Wiegman took over as England manager in September 2021

England manager Sarina Wiegman's record at major tournaments is almost impeccable - so how has she adapted in order to chase further success?

"My approach is the same - I just worry a little bit less," says Wiegman.

But there have been changes for the Lionesses boss, who is attempting to win a third successive Euros title as a manager after leading the Netherlands and England to victories on home soil in 2017 and 2022 respectively.

Wiegman has been with the Football Association for four years now and has grown to love England, its football-obsessed culture and even its roast dinners.

In the job, she has had to adapt to growing media scrutiny, raised expectations and challenges on and off the pitch. It has not always been easy.

"In the beginning I wanted to solve everything but as a coach you just have to let go sometimes and let things solve themselves," said Wiegman.

"I always try to compare it with your family. You sometimes have a conflict or a discussion, that's completely normal. You need to share what you feel.

"We all know that we want to go forward to the highest level. We also know we need each other, so we have the conversation and move on. 

"I've become a little bit older too, with more experience in football, life, in England and with the team. 

"You have set the tone at the beginning on how you want things. Then you hope things become organic and everyone knows how it works."

Wiegman says her "values won't change" and, as part of that, insists she always tries to be "as honest and open as possible".

Her approach, particularly after recent international retirements by Mary Earps and Fran Kirby, as well Millie Bright's withdrawal from Euro 2025, has sometimes been questioned, and is often described as 'direct'. 

"When I have conversations with players, I think it's really important to have clarity. Especially now [at] the tournament," said Wiegman.

"There are also moments in friendlies where you don't want clarity so they can compete for the spot. I try to give players as much information as possible.

"The players call that direct but, I think, do not confuse that with being blunt. I am not blunt - well, I hope not. I am trying to be honest and clear to give context."

The directness, Wiegman admits, comes a little bit from her native country the Netherlands, and she has learned to "interpret" how the English approach situations.

She says she "hates rules" but she sets high standards and expects her players to follow suit, insisting her only condition was to remove jewellery for safety.

Asked if she has introduced a seating plan at dinner, Wiegman said: "I don't do that! When I was a school teacher I would do those things, but now it's so intense. 

"The players travel so much, they need to find some space away from training sessions and meetings where they can just sit with who they want to sit with. 

"If it's always the same and that gives a player that headspace and relaxation, that's good for the team.

"I actually hate rules. Everyone is really aware [that] we are here to perform and be at our best. If you use your common sense, then you make the right decisions. 

"I try to get principles or agreements [established] and if there is not an agreement then of course I'm going to say 'OK, I think this is how we're going to do it'."

Wiegman is clearly comfortable in her role now and the players know how things work, but the manager still has to make tough decisions.

While her directness is a personality trait that's frequently discussed, Wiegman says she has a different side to her that makes the job difficult.

"For me, I am actually very caring and that's often not very helpful in this job. I want to take care of people but I have a job where I have to make hard decisions," she said.

"As a former player and maybe as a mum, I'm trying to not put myself in their shoes and think 'oh, they must feel horrible' because I have to shut that out for a moment.

"That is one of the most difficult parts of the job because, yeah, it's not the nicest part but I have to give that clarity - because that is my job."

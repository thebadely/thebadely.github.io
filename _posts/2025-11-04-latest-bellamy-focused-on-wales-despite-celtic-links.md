It has been recently reported that Craig Bellamy captained Wales during a career in which he earned 78 caps and scored 19 goals

Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is "completely focused" on qualifying for next year's World Cup despite being linked with Celtic, says Football Association of Wales chief executive Noel Mooney.

Bellamy - who had a loan spell at Celtic during his playing career - has been touted as a potential successor to Brendan Rodgers following the former Liverpool manager's departure from the Scottish champions last week.

But Wales are in the middle of a World Cup qualifying campaign, with games against Liechtenstein and North Macedonia this month, and are set to be involved in the play-offs in March.

"Craig's done a terrific job with Cymru [Wales], he's built an identity with us and a style of playing that has really got you all excited," Mooney told S4C's Sgorio.

"He's a year and a bit into the job of a four-year contract, and we're completely focused on going to the World Cup in America, Canada and Mexico next year.

"Two massive matches in November that he's absolutely focused on. Look, when you do well in any job I think you'll get linked to other jobs - and Celtic is a massive football club."

Bellamy, who started his coaching career with Cardiff City's academy before working as Vincent Kompany's assistant at Anderlecht and Burnley, has impressed in his first senior managerial role.

The 46-year-old made the best start of any Wales boss following his appointment in July 2024, going nine matches unbeaten and winning promotion to the top tier of the Nations League while implementing an adventurous new style of play.

The former Liverpool and Manchester City player is in the midst of the most testing spell of his tenure so far, with Wales losing three of their past four games in all competitions.

If Celtic were to prise Bellamy away, they would have to pay what FAW sources have described to BBC Sport Wales as a "significant, seven-figure" compensation fee, which would be higher if it was activated before next year's World Cup.

In terms of salary, however, Bellamy earns far less than some of the other candidates for the Celtic job - such as Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna - having taken a pay cut from his previous role as Burnley assistant coach.

"He [Bellamy] is going to get linked with roles. He's an exciting coach who has really captured the imagination of a lot of people," Mooney added.

"He will go from strength to strength with Cymru and I'm sure after us he will go on to manage the best teams in the world. I have no doubt about that.

"But, for now, we're completely focused on getting to the World Cup. All of us. We say 'Together Stronger' at the FAW and Craig is right at the heart of that.

"As I say, six points in November is our goal, onto the play-offs, and then on to the World Cup we go."

How is Swiatek's grip affecting her forehand smash?

Strawberries and cream - the traditional food combination seen at Wimbledon, but a different take on it may be fuelling Iga Swiatek's bid for the title.

Following her straight-set win against American Danielle Collins on Saturday, she was asked what she would have to eat to celebrate it.

"I have my favourite actually," she said. "I ate it as a kid. It is pasta with strawberries."

Sorry, what?

"You should try it guys," Swiatek continued. "Pasta with strawberries and a little bit of yoghurt. It is just great."

It sounds an unusual combination - and for many people in the world it is - although it is a delicacy in Swiatek's native Poland.

Tucking into it regularly seems to be doing the job as Swiatek is enjoying an impressive run at Wimbledon, beating Collins 6-2 6-3 in one hour and 15 minutes to set up a fourth-round meeting with Clara Tauson of Denmark.

The five-time Grand Slam champion has not fared well on grass in recent years and only twice before Saturday had she reached the fourth round at SW19.

But it has been a different story so far this year and, after Swiatek made the final of Bad Homburg last month, she has carried that momentum into Wimbledon.

Against Collins she dictated play with her first serve and faced just three break points in the match, saving all of them.

What is the secret to this upturn in form on grass?

"Honestly, it is much more fun [on the grass] this year," said the 24-year-old former world number one.

"The ball is listening to me. When it listens to me I don't need to do much. It is pretty smooth."

Andreeva is the youngest player since 2006 to reach the fourth round at each of the first three Grand Slams of the season

Teenager Mirra Andreeva showed why she is one of the hottest prospects in the sport after moving into the fourth round with a comfortable win.

Seventh seed Andreeva, 18, outclassed American opponent Hailey Baptiste in a 6-1 6-3 victory on Court One.

Russia's Andreeva reached her first Grand Slam semi-final at the French Open last month and is aiming to surpass that on the Wimbledon grass.

She has reached the last 16 for the second time in her career, having previously done the same in 2023.

"Before I played today I told myself, 'Just go out there and do something'," said Andreeva, who is making only her third appearance at the All England Club.

"I always expect something from myself but I always try to let myself go and enjoy.

"I feel with every match I play, my level is rising."

Raducanu does not trust 'dodgy' electronic line calls

Showing supreme movement and clinical ball-striking, Andreeva breezed through the opening set in 31 minutes.

Baptiste, ranked 55th in the world, was willed on in the second set by an enthusiastic crowd who wanted to see a true contest.

When Andreeva broke for a 3-1 lead, the result looked a formality. Baptiste instantly broke back to halt Andreeva's progress but lost serve again as the world number seven secured a straightforward win in one hour and 18 minutes.

Under the tutelage of former SW19 champion Conchita Martinez, she has already won two WTA 1,000 titles - the rung of tournaments below the majors - in Dubai and Indian Wells this season.

Her impressive progress is demonstrated by the fact she has won 35 tour-level main-draw matches this year - a tally only bettered by world number one Aryna Sabalenka (44) and Swiatek (37).

A much tougher test than 23-year-old Baptiste awaits Andreeva next, however.

Reigning champion Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and American 10th seed Emma Navarro meet later on Saturday for the right to face her.

The early play on Saturday at Wimbledon was affected by rain

Another big seed was sent tumbling out of Wimbledon as former champion Elena Rybakina suffered a straight-set defeat by Tauson in a match that took more than four hours to complete because of rain delays.

Eleventh seed Rybakina, who won the Championships in 2022, was beaten 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 by Denmark's Tauson, who knocked out former British number one Heather Watson in the opening round.

Rain initially caused this match on the exposed court two to be suspended at 4-4, but once play resumed two hours later it was a tight contest as neither player could be separated, before Tauson saved two set points and then took the opener in the tie-break.

The Dane continued her momentum by breaking Rybakina's first service game in the second set, before the players went off the court as rain fell once more with Tauson leading 4-2.

But this delay was only around 15 minutes and Tauson returned to the court to seal another break and close out the win.

Tauson, who had never won on grass before this year, will next face eighth seed Swiatek.

"Thanks to the crowd it amazing to play here today even though it was a little rainy," she said.

"Before this grass season had started I had never won a match on grass, so I am super proud."

More than half of the seeded players at Wimbledon in the men's and women's draw have been knocked out.

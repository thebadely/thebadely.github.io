Final leaderboard

Patrick Reed beat three opponents in a play-off to claim his first LIV Tour win in Dallas.

The 34-year-old American had finished on six under alongside England's Paul Casey, South African Louis Oosthuizen and Japan's Jinichiro Kozuma.

Reed, who switched to LIV from the PGA Tour three years ago, holed a testing putt for a birdie on the first play-off hole to seal victory.

He held a three-shot lead going into Sunday but was three over for his final round of 75.

England's Tyrrell Hatton held the lead briefly on the back nine but a double bogey on the 12th hole scuppered his chances and he finished in a group one behind on five under. 

Sergio Garcia did not claim any points for finishing tied for 25th place on three over par but still booked a place at The Open at Royal Portrush.

The Spaniard qualified by claiming the spot available to a player in the top five of the LIV standings who had not already secured a place at the major in July.

"It's going to be my second time playing at Royal Portrush, and it's obviously nice," said Garcia, who is fifth in the LIV Golf individual standings.

"It's one of the goals that you have at the beginning of the year, to try to play as many majors as you can with the limitations that we have.

"I didn't help myself very much the last three months, but I'm glad that I got enough work done in the first third of the year, I guess, in the first part of the season. I'm excited about it, and hopefully I'll play well."

Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka withdrew from the Dallas event on Friday after hitting a tee box marker into the crowd.

He smashed his club into the ground then struck the marker on the left of the tee towards a small group of fans after a poor tee shot on the ninth hole.

Koepka pulled out, citing illness, after a bogey on that hole put him on seven over.

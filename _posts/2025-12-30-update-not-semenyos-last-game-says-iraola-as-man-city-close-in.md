Manchester City are close to agreeing terms with Bournemouth to sign Antoine Semenyo for Â£65m - but Andoni Iraola insists the forward has "definitely not" played his last game for the Cherries.

City's move for the Ghana forward, 25, is at an advanced stage with talks over the past 48 hours aimed at closing the finer details of the deal.

They have agreed to meet Semenyo's Â£65m release clause, while the player's representatives were in Manchester on Monday finalising personal terms.

Discussions continued on Tuesday, with sources indicating a total agreement is now close with the January transfer window due to open on Thursday.

Semenyo, who played the full 90 minutes of the 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday, has been keen for his future to be resolved by 1 January. 

However, Iraola is adamant the attacker will play against Arsenal on Saturday, 3 January.

"He is a massive player for us and he will still be with us," the Bournemouth boss told BBC Match of the Day. 

"It is not the last game he has played for us, definitely not."

Sources have told BBC Sport Bournemouth want him to play against the Gunners and then Tottenham on Wednesday, 7 January before the release mechanism in his deal elapses on 10 January.

As reported by BBC Sport on Sunday, Liverpool retain an interest in Semenyo but, unless the Premier League champions launch a late bid, he is heading to City.

Despite interest from five clubs, including Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham, City remain the only one to have made formal contact with Bournemouth.

Semenyo joined Bournemouth from Bristol City in 2023 for a fee in excess of Â£10m

Although Semenyo conceded a penalty in the draw at Chelsea, he showed what Bournemouth will be missing should he leave with his two long throws into the box leading to the visitors' two goals.

At the end of the match, he applauded the away fans in what appeared to be a goodbye to them, with several of his team-mates also coming over to hug him.

Semenyo has scored nine goals and provided three assists for Bournemouth this season, and team-mate David Brooks said his departure will be a big loss.

"I'm not going to sit here and say he doesn't leave a hole," the Wales international told BBC Match of the Day. 

"He's our top scorer and he's been a very, very good player for us over the past couple of years.

"Everyone loves Ants in our team and if he's going to join someone else we wish him all the best, he's earned it."

Former Chelsea and Blackburn striker Chris Sutton added on BBC Radio 5 Live: "Three and a half outstanding seasons as a Bournemouth player - the issue Andoni Iraola's got is how do you replace him? How do you replace his numbers?

"A phenomenal player who'll go with the Bournemouth fans' best wishes. He's been a top player for them."

Ex-Aston Villa and Manchester United striker Dion Dublin said Semenyo's exit would feel like losing more than just one player for Bournemouth.

"As a manager you can think to yourself, 'bring the money in, I back myself as a coach', and I'm sure Iraola does," he added.

"But Semenyo is such a big player that it is like losing two or three players."

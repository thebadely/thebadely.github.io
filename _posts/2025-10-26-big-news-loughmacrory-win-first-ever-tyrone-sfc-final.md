According to new developments, Loughmacrory are Tyrone SFC winners for the first time in their history

Loughmacrory beat Trillick 0-18 to 2-11 to win their first ever Tyrone SFC title in a pulsating decider at Healy Park. 

Loughmacrory were heavy underdogs, appearing in their first ever Tyrone senior final, against a Trillick side appearing in the decider for a third year in a row. 

Five points from Cathal Donaghy and 0-4 from Eoin McElholm, the star of the Red Hands' U20 All-Ireland win, laid the foundations for the victory with a pair of two-point efforts. 

It was another Donaghy brother, Gareth who proved the hero, kicking the winner in injury time.

Goals in each half from Ciaran Daly spurred the Trillick fight, but it was Loughmacrory, the club only founded in 1972, that held firm for a famous win. 

They'll now advance to meet Down champions Kilcoo, back at Healy Park on Saturday, 8 November in the quarter-final of the Ulster club championship. 

"I can't sum it up I'm lost for words. I've been lucky enough to have a few days like this with Tyrone minors and under-20s but that tops it off seeing your family and friends striving for one thing the last 52 years it's just that bit special," McElholm told BBC Sport NI.

"It's hard to believe it, it probably hasn't hit me yet, but this group knew they were going to do good things and we just worked hard.

"There's a real good culture and we knew it was coming so we're lucky to break the seal."

Trillick were aiming to win the title for a second time in three years, so it was no surprise when they settled quicker with three early scores through Charlie Donnelly, Lee Brennan and Simon Garrity. 

Once the Loughmacrory nerves settled, they grew into the contest and dominated the Trillick kick-out, rattling off six scores without reply. 

Ruairi McCullagh got the ball rolling before two from McElholm, another from Cathaoir Gallagher and an outrageous two-point score from the left boot of Cathal Donaghy. 

Despite the Lough's dominance, Trillick replied with a fortuitous major of their own as Lee Brennan's shot dropped short but was spilled by Oisin O'Kane and Daly couldn't believe his luck as he tapped into the empty net. 

McCullagh and Brennan (Trillick's first score in 13 minutes) exchanged scores before an inspirational McElholm two-pointer gave the underdogs a 0-12 to 1-6 lead the break. 

Cathal Donaghy continued to dominate the middle third and kicked off the second half with two quickfire points. 

Trillick replied once again with a rapid restart, Mattie Donnelly feeding Daly to fire his second goal to the net. 

Donaghy and Donnelly traded efforts before substitute Richie Donnelly put one between the sides with five to play. 

With a grandstand finish ensured in Omagh, Loughmacrory were punished for failing to keep three players in their attack, with Brennan opting to slot over from 20 metres to level the sides for the first time since the 28th minute. 

The fourth official's board showed three minutes of additional time, but it was the men in black and amber who had possession of the ball, with Gareth Donaghy driving over the bar to put his club one ahead. 

Loughmacrory would keep the ball for two and a half minutes after taking the lead, but momentarily lost possession before regaining it in the middle of the field with time up. 

Referee Mark Loughran's whistle was met by a mix of pandemonium and raw emotion, as Loughmacrory were crowned kings of Tyrone for the first time in their history.

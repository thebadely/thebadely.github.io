Let's dive into the details: Affordale Fury breaks for home in the Savills Chase 

Affordale Fury delivered a first Grade One winner for County Down owner Philip Polly in a thrilling Savills Chase at Leopardstown on Sunday.

Trained by Noel Meade, the seven-year-old started and finished the three-mile race in fine form to tear up the script.

Much of the pre-race narrative focused on a rematch of March's Cheltenham Gold Cup when Inothewayurthinkin denied Galopin Des Champs a third-straight win, but that duel failed to materialise this time.

Instead, it was those in red and black celebrating as Sam Ewing guided Affordale Fury (7-1) to a big win.

"I can't believe it - what a week we've had," a delighted Polly told RTE Sport.

"We won the Bumper on Boxing Day and now we've rocked up and won the Savills."

Champ Kiely was an early faller on the flat as Affordale Fury got out in front of what was a bunched field.

It remained wide open heading into the final two hurdles when favourite Galopin Des Champs made a move.

However, the Willie Mullins-trained favourite had to settle for third as Affordale Fury responded brilliantly to surge home from 2024 Grand National winner I Am Maximus in second (50-1).

It capped a superb two days for Ewing, who was onboard Favori De Champdou and Solness for Grade One wins on Saturday.

"I wanted to be good and positive going into the first and see where we landed," said Ewing.

"He travelled really strong, winged fences for sport and there was no coming back from it. He was gutsy and is a proper horse in the making."

Jockey Jack Kennedy and Teahupo break for home 

The Christmas Hurdle went to second favourite Teahupo (5-2), who produced a strong finish to turn the tables on Bob Olinger (11-1) from their meeting at Cheltenham in March.

It ensured another Grade One win for trainer Gordon Elliott, who had two big wins as part of a four-timer at Leopardstown on Saturday.

Rocky's Diamond made the early running, opening a gap on the chasing pack which was led by Ballyburn, and maintained the advantage until the second hurdle from last as Teahupo, ridden by Jack Kennedy, jumped into the lead.

There was no looking back despite a challenge from Henry de Bromhead's Bob Olinger, with race favourite Ballyburn (13-8) placing third.

"When we jumped the front at the second last and I got him onto the straight, he did fairly well," said Kennedy.

"He has been some horse to me and everyone who is involved with him - it's hard to get ones like him."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The sun was shining, a few hardy autograph hunters were still waiting for signatures and pictures, and the rest of the Celtic players were contentedly chatting to family and friends on the confetti-strewn pitch.

The 13th Scottish Premiership trophy lift of the past 14 years at Celtic Park was complete, and the scene is one of joyous celebration. With one small exception.

Captain Callum McGregor, while happy to enjoy the party with his own nearest and dearest, was irked.

"I'm still in a bad mood about the game," he told BBC Scotland.

Why was he unhappy? Because Celtic failed to beat St Mirren at home, only securing a late draw.

Even though the champions had long since secured their fourth consecutive title. Even though they kept going to the last kick of the ball to secure a point. 

Their usual standards were not met and that annoyed the skipper. Even on trophy day.

Celtic's man for all seasons maintains 16-year record

It speaks to the way expectations have risen in the past decade at Celtic.

Since Brendan Rodgers first walked in the door nine years ago, a culture change has evolved in Glasgow's east end. 

The club has gone through several gears in its evolution into a ruthless winning machine.  

It was the predecessor to Rodgers' second spell in charge, Ange Postecoglou, who coined the phrase, "We never stop".

Rodgers has not uttered those words, but his ethos is exactly the same.

With a Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen to play, and a summer transfer window to negotiate, he's already looking forward even on this day of celebration.

"We work so hard all year and there are so many sacrifices to bring this success, so that's why it belongs to everyone at the club," Rodgers told BBC Scotland.

"To serve them on a day like today, it is a real honour and privilege to manage the club and, of course, when you pick up the title, it is a real conviction for all the hard work.

"It is the expectation of the club - it drives you every day and, when you are at such a big club, there is no time to rest.

"We enjoy this today and tonight and the supporters deserve to do that, but you are quickly on to next week and the next season."

Defender Liam Scales says the nature of the club's fan base help fuel them each season.

"The fans drive the standards week in, week out," the Irishman said. 

"We're not allowed to drop the standards ever.

"It's great, brilliant. You'll get the best out of everyone if there's competition all over the park."

As far as next week goes, Rodgers now has something of a dilemma. 

Several of his top players were nowhere near their best in the 1-1 draw with St Mirren. 

Substitute James Forrest was probably the man of the match, despite only playing half an hour.

His dramatic equaliser secured his 16th consecutive scoring season in Scottish football's top flight, a remarkable achievement.

Did he do enough to start at Hampden?

In midfield Arne Engels and Paulo Bernardo found it difficult to cut through a disciplined, organised St Mirren side.

Could Luke McCowan come into Rodgers' thinking? 

Those questions aside, Celtic are strong favourites to secure a sixth treble in nine seasons.

If it comes, it will quickly be about doing it all again.

It has been recently reported that Harry Skelton celebrates after winning by four lengths on Panic Attack

Jockey Harry Skelton saluted a big win at Cheltenham on Panic Attack and then revealed he is awaiting news on the arrival of his second child.

Skelton gave an aeroplane celebration with his outstretched arms as he crossed the line after triumphing aboard the 6-1 chance in the Paddy Power Gold Cup for his trainer brother Dan.

Favourite Vincenzo was second, while the winning trainer's Hoe Joly Smoke was third as he boosted his bid for the British trainers' championship.

"Bridget's due date is today," said Harry, who has an 18-month-old son Rory with his wife, fellow jockey Bridget Andrews.

"I don't know if she's started having the baby yet, I'll go and see if she has. I'm sure she'll be watching at home with Rory - they make me prouder than anything else."

Dan Skelton has just missed out on the British title to Irish trainer Willie Mullins for the second year running and is bidding to go one better this season.

"I'm chuffed to bits. Harry gave her a great ride. Hopefully Bridget doesn't go into labour too quick," he said.

Panic Attack is the first mare to win the big race since Happy Diva in 2019.

It was a first success in the Â£160,000 chase for the brothers, who had finished second with Spiritofthegames in 2020 and Protektorat the following year

Saturday's showpiece is one of the first big races of the British jumps season, which concludes at the end of April.

The action went ahead at Cheltenham after the course passed a morning inspection, following heavy rain in the previous 24 hours as Storm Claudia hit the UK.

Racing took place on Friday, the opening day of the three-day meeting, but 35mm of rain fell throughout the day, with the going changed to heavy, soft in places.

The bend turning into the home straight was reconfigured to avoid unraceable, waterlogged areas and the penultimate fence on the chase course will be bypassed.

Racing at Uttoxeter was also given the go-ahead although the meeting at Irish track Navan was called off, with races rescheduled for Monday.

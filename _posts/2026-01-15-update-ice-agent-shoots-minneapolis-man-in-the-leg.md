Experts revealed that An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer has shot a man in the leg in the US city of Minneapolis, where an ICE agent shot dead a woman last week.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said federal officers initially pursued the man in a car chase because he was illegally in the US from Venezuela.

The City of Minneapolis confirmed a man was shot and taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries. An ICE officer was also taken to hospital to be treated for injuries, the DHS said.

Minneapolis city officials said on X: "We understand there is anger. We ask the public to remain calm."

"The City of Minneapolis again demands that ICE leave the city and state immediately," they added.

The man got out of his car and an altercation took place between him and an ICE official, the DHS said. It added that during the incident two other people emerged from a nearby apartment building and allegedly "attacked" the officer.

"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots," the DHS statement said, adding "both attackers are in custody".

The BBC could not immediately independently verify details in the statements. Minneapolis Police chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI is investigating the incident.

In response to the latest ICE shooting, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey accused federal officers of "creating chaos" across the state.

Protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting soon after the news first emerged, condemning ICE raids in Minneapolis, the largest city in the state of Minnesota. 

Around 3,000 ICE officers have been deployed to Minnesota over recent weeks.

Demonstrations also took place there last week after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot dead by an ICE agent.

Federal officials accused Good of trying to run over immigration agents with her car, but Frey said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly.

Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. 

The FBI is investigating the incident.

In a statement on X responding to reports of ICE shooting the man in the leg, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said: "Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting."

Shortly before news of the latest shooting emerged, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urging Trump to end the "occupation" of ICE officers in the state in a video on social media.

"Angry is not a strong enough word," Walz said during his address.

Let's dive into the details: Luke Humphries completed darts' triple crown by winning the Premier League

World number one Luke Humphries gained revenge on Luke Littler as he won a pulsating final to win the Premier League for the first time.

After losing to world champion Littler in last year's final, Humphries triumphed 11-8 in the repeat as the world's top two duked it out at O2 Arena.

The emergence of Littler has often seen Humphries referred to as 'the other Luke' but this was his moment as he completed the triple crown of the World Championship, World Matchplay and now the Premier League.

"That one means the world to me. It's the one I was missing," Humphries told Sky Sports.

"I said in all my pre-match build-up the last few days that it was the one I wanted.

"I've done it now. If I don't win another title I will happy, because I've won the three hardest ones now."

It was the 23rd match between the pair and Littler, who beat Gerwyn Price in the semi-finals, made a fantastic start to race into a 3-0 lead.

Both players showed signs of nerves with a number of errors in a tense opening, and Humphries was able to miss five darts at double and still break back before taking out 130 to level at 3-3.

There was still nothing to separate them at the break - one that seemed to benefit both players as the standard sky-rocketed after the resumption.

Humphries, in particular, came out firing. He broke with an 11-darter and moved two legs clear with a 12-dart hold.

Another 11-darter made it 8-6 and while Littler was holding throw reasonably comfortably, he was unable to put the requisite pressure on the Humphries throw.

There were still nervy moments for Humphries and he went all the way down to double two before moving 10-8 ahead before managing to break once more, finishing on double 10 to clinch victory and take the Â£275,000 prize money.

For Littler, who edged it 100.29 to 97.86 on the averages, a remarkable campaign that saw him set a points record in the league phase and claim a record six nightly wins ends in disappointment.

It might have been different had he been better on the outer ring, where he was just eight of 27 for 29.6%. Although, Humphries was only fractionally more clinical at 29.7%.

"I had a little bit of a thing after the game - nobody likes losing - but I'm fine," Littler told Sky Sports.

"I am glad to say the Premier League is over - it's been a tough 17 weeks. Happy it's over, and I came runner-up, but I will be back next year."

Humphries can celebrate coming on top in the latest instalment of a rivalry that looks set to run and run but that will be put on hold soon as Humphries and Littler prepare to team up for England at the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in June.

The night began with Price threatening an upset against Littler in the first semi-final.

The Welshman put his teenage opponent under pressure immediately with two early breaks of throw - in a match that had eight in total - but each time, Littler responded.

However, Price went into the first mini break leading 6-4 with Littler, who admitted to nerves early on, storming off the stage with a face like thunder.

But when play resumed, the Littler who topped the league phase in record-breaking fashion emerged and he proceeded to win six of the next seven legs - including the last four - to take it 10-7 and progress in style.

While Littler was able to relax backstage ahead of the final, Humphries and Nathan Aspinall were involved in an almighty tussle in the second semi-final.

Both players finished with averages in excess of 100 with the match tied at 5-5 at the break.

Just like Littler, Humphries stepped it up in the second half and ramped up the pressure on Aspinall.

The man from Stockport dug in though, and hit a brilliant 124 checkout - finishing on the bull - to level at 7-7 just as Humphries looked certain to break.

'Cool Hand' eventually secured the crucial break to go up 9-7 and completed the job in the next leg to set up the mouth-watering final most had expected.

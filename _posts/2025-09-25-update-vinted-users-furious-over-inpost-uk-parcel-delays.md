Let's dive into the details: Users of the second-hand shopping app Vinted have taken to social media in outrage over severe delays in receiving their orders via one of the firm's partner couriers.

Posts seen by the BBC describe parcels not being collected from InPost UK lockers or left stuck in transit without updated tracking information.

Some customers were notified their items had been delivered but had not received them, while others reported technical faults at lockers during collection.

InPost UK, which distributes parcels to lockers for customers to collect, has apologised for network "delays" caused by an IT issue.

Sonia Fallows, from Manchester, is waiting for a delivery of second-hand toy building blocks she ordered from Vinted. 

She told the BBC: "It's been stuck in the warehouse for eight days without being scanned."

"I have spoken to them every day and they keep running circles around me. They are just not doing anything."

Ms Fallows said she was a regular user of the courier service, which was "usually really good" but was now left frustrated.

"I have got some favourite sellers on Vinted, but if they are going to use InPost I just won't use them anymore," she added. 

On its website, InPost UK blamed the problems on a "software integration issue".

It said it had "isolated the root cause" and was "making significant progress" on resolving the problem.

However, some InPost UK users were told the issues would be resolved by Wednesday but have been left waiting for their parcels.

Posting on X, one woman described how she was given a new delivery date of 22 October, adding she "won't use Inpost ever again".

Another posted: "Here we all still are in the dark about where are parcels are and when they will arrive."

InPost acquired parcel delivery firm Yodel in May, a move that the two companies said would create one of the largest logistics firms in the UK.

At the time of the deal, InPost UK chief executive Neil Kuschel announced plans to expand and handle more than 300 million parcels a year, saying the company was "reshaping the future of parcel delivery".

The Daily Telegraph and the Times both report on NHS data showing caesarean births have overtaken natural deliveries for the first time in England.

Experts name factors such as rising obesity rates and mothers having children later for the increase in c-sections.

The Daily Mail picks up on an aspect of the vision of Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy for the future funding of the BBC, claiming that those on benefits would get free TV licences. The paper says this would be paid for by "middle class families". The Times also leads on the same angle, quoting the shadow culture secretary, Nigel Huddlestone, who calls it "outrageous". Nandy has said funding needs to be fair and sustainable.

The i Paper has launched what it's calling a "Killer Kitchen" campaign, focusing on the dangers of toxic silica dust that can be inhaled by tradespeople cutting artificial stone for worktops.

A health and safety executive is quoted saying it urged importers and distributors to promote the use of low silica products.

The Daily Express carries an interview with a former police officer, Pam Wilkes, who survived the deadly IRA Harrods bomb 42 years ago today.

And merchandise honouring a raccoon which went viral after it broke into a liquor store in the US and passed  out drunk is featured by the Guardian, after sales raised a $250,000 (£186,000) for the animal shelter which took care of the mammal. Items bear the slogan "trashed panda" with a cartoon raccoon sprawled on the floor, replicating the photo of the animal when it was discovered.

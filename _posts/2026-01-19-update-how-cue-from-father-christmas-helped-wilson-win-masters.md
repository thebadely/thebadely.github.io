Best shots of the 2026 Masters final

Picture the scene. An emotional Kyren Wilson is cutting a dejected and disconsolate figure in the dark and grey bowels of the York Barbican. 

Not only has he had family health issues to contend with, but a difficult campaign has been compounded by being forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 - after it was damaged in a "freak accident". 

The Englishman even says he was close to having a "mental breakdown" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship - just last month.

The future looked forlorn. 

Then fast forward just six weeks to images of Wilson pouring out of Alexandra Palace on Sunday, as he lifted the Paul Hunter Trophy and celebrated his maiden Masters triumph with his family. 

"It's amazing. Father Christmas was very kind to me," said Wilson, who auctioned off his beloved old cue for a children's cancer charity, raising Â£5,250.

"It was a complete freak accident, what happened to my cue, so there are no bad feelings there but it is so important to have something you can trust out there."

Armed with a suitable replacement, Wilson, 34, made it third time lucky when he became the 26th winner of the Masters, having twice previously been defeated in the final. 

His route to glory and a second Triple Crown title took him past Si Jiahui, Neil Robertson, Wu Yize and finally four-time world champion John Higgins, who is widely regarded as one of the game's greatest players. 

"I'll be honest I thought at the UK Championship I was gone, I honestly didn't know if I was ever going to be back in the winners' enclosure," Wilson added.

"I have such a supportive family and I promised my mum she was going to have that bit of crystal [Masters trophy] on her dining room table.

"People don't see what happens behind closed doors but I was in a bad way at the UK - really, really suffering.

"To pick up a new cue and, after one month, to go and win the second biggest major is an incredible achievement."

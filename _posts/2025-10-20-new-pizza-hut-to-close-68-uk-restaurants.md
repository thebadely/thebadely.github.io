It has been recently reported that Pizza Hut is to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery sites in the UK with the loss of 1,210 jobs, after the firm running them fell into administration.

DC London Pie Limited, which operates Pizza Hut's UK restaurants, appointed FTI Consulting as administrators on Monday.

However, Pizza Hut's global owner Yum! Brands has agreed to save 64 restaurants, preserving 1,276 jobs.

Pizza Hut is well known for its family-friendly dining and salad bar, but its UK business has been struggling and had previously gone into administration less than a year ago.

DC London Pie had bought Pizza Hut UK's restaurants from insolvency in January this year. The company also owns Pizza Hut franchises in Sweden and Denmark.

A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: "We are pleased to secure the continuation of 64 sites to safeguard our guest experience and protect the associated jobs."

Nicolas Burquier, managing director for Pizza Hut Europe and Canada, said: "This targeted acquisition aims to safeguard our guest experience and protect jobs where possible."

He added that the immediate priority for Pizza Hut was "operational continuity at the acquired locations and supporting colleagues through the transition".

Zoe Adjay, a senior lecturer in hospitality at the University of East London, said Pizza Hut had been "at the forefront of bringing fast food into the UK" in the 1970s, but had struggled to remain relevant amid increased competition.

"The pizza market has become a lot more upmarket," she said. "There's a lot more high-end pizza and they've taken a huge market share."

Ms Adjay added that Pizza Hut had also failed to establish itself on social media in the same way as some of its competitors.

Increased operating costs and "ongoing consumer caution" will likely have contributed to Pizza Hut's challenges, according to Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.

"DC London Pie had rescued Pizza Hut's UK operations from insolvency less than a year ago, but making a success of a big-name casual dining businesses is a tough job.

"Taking back the brand looks a smart move by Yum! Brands as it has decades of data about how pizza lovers like to consume and exactly what factors need to coalesce to make a location a success."

Munster moved sixth in the United Rugby Championship and guaranteed their place in the play-off quarter-finals and next season's Champions Cup with a hard-fought 30-21 victory over Benetton at Virgin Media Park.

Benetton led 14-10 at the break but the Irish province responded after half-time to win.

Jack Crowley scored the opening try on 14 minutes when he dashed over from close range to score beside the posts, the Ireland fly-half converting his own touchdown.

Benetton responded with a try from Rhyno Smith as he went on angled run, skipped through an attempted tackle and dived over, Jacob Umaga converting.

Crowley's penalty edged the hosts in front again but the visitors went ahead with a stunning breakaway try.

Craig Casey missed a tackle on fly-half Umaga on halfway and he fed Smith who raced away for his second try.

Four minutes into the second half Lee Barron rumbled over from a maul after a line-out, Crowley off-target with the tee on that occasion.

Thaakir Abrahams then showed a fine turn of pace after accepting an offload for Munster's third try and Casey added a superb conversion from the touchline.

Crowley set up the score with a cross-kick for Diarmuid Kilgallen on the wing and he provided the pass for the South African to race clear.

A Casey penalty extended the lead to 11 but Munster weren't finished and Bautista Bernasconi barged over for their third score. Umaga's kick reduced the deficit to four.

Josh Wycherley powered over to give the home side some breathing space, Casey contributing the additional two points.

Here’s what you need to know: Showers are expected to turn wintry over hills in the north UK this weekend

Temperatures across the UK are set to fall this weekend, triggering the first snowfall of the season for some areas.

This coincides with the end of British Summer Time as the clocks go back with the weather reflecting the shift towards a more wintry feel. 

Temperatures will be below average with strong, gusty winds making it feel especially cold and raw.

This change in weather is driven by the position of Storm Benjamin in the North Sea, drawing down a cold Arctic northerly airflow across the UK.

Cold arctic air will affect all of the UK this weekend

In the wake of Storm Benjamin, the UK will come under the influence of a brisk northerly wind, which could reach gale force at times along eastern counties on Saturday.

Frequent showers are expected in coastal areasâespecially along north-facing shores.

Whilst there will be some autumnal sunshine, temperatures are set to dip slightly below average for the time of year, with daytime highs ranging between just 8 and 11C.

But with that biting, Arctic wind it could feel up to 5C colder, especially on the east coast of Scotland and north-east England.

If showers fall over high ground - mainly above 400m - there is the chance these will turn to snow.

This is most likely over the highest ground in Scotland where a few centimetres of snow accumulation are possible. 

There may also be a touch of wintriness over the highest hills of northern England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

But it's all change again next week.

A change in wind direction will bring milder temperatures. Then by the end of the week, heavy rain and strong winds look likely.

You can keep up to date with the weather where you are on the BBC Weather app or by checking the forecast online.

When do the clocks change in the UK and why do we follow daylight saving time?

Joseph Parker weighed almost 20lb heavier than Fabio Wardley as both heavyweights cut confident figures - albeit in contrasting ways - for Saturday's headliner in London.

New Zealand's Parker will put his WBO 'interim' belt and chance to fight for the world title on the line against the undefeated Wardley at the O2 Arena.

Undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk has signalled his intention to defend his four belts against the winner.

"This is it. This means everything," said a serious but focused Wardley, 30, at Friday's weigh-in.

The Ipswich fighter - who holds the WBA 'interim' belt - came in at 17st 5lb (110 kg), consistent with his recent bouts.

"This is the one before the one. All the work is done. Training is ticked off. All the hard work is put in. Let's get some rest now. Big night coming up tomorrow," he added.

Spitalfields Market in east London saw more than fresh produce on the scales as the two heavyweights squared up for the final time before fight night.

Parker winked at the camera and bobbed along to the music.

As he flexed his muscles, he looked hefty and powerful as he tipped the scales at 18st 10lb (119 kg), just five pounds lighter than his career-heaviest. 

It is a far cry from the 16st 12lb (107 kg) version who lost his world title to Anthony Joshua in 2018.

"We're weary, we're cautious, but I'm going to fight fire with fire and I'm going to get to him," Parker said.

I'm at a different level and will smash him - Parker

Wardley, dressed in an Ipswich Town jersey, kept a straight face, acknowledged the crowd, but appeared zoned in.

He may be the lighter guy, but Wardley has superb knockout power. He staged a dramatic comeback against Justis Huni in June, trailing on the scorecards before stopping his opponent in the 10th round despite being outboxed for much of the fight.

"Joseph Parker, his team and boxing fans will learn I am meant to be at the top of this division," Wardley said.

"Every opponent has been the one critics say will beat me. This is the one. He's too quick, too fast, too experienced. But I haven't been beaten yet, and nothing will change tomorrow night."

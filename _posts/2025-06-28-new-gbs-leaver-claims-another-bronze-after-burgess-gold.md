Experts revealed that Lois Leaver won her first Canoe Slalom World Cup medal in Spain earlier this month 

Great Britain's Lois Leaver claimed bronze at the Canoe Slalom World Cup event in Prague on Saturday to add to Adam Burgess' gold.

Leaver clinched third in the women's kayak final by just 0.1 seconds, despite the 23-year-old Scot picking up a penalty.

American Evy Leibfarth claimed gold ahead of Camille Prigent of France, while Leaver has now won bronze in all three of this year's World Cup events so far.

Burgess won the men's C1 silver at this year's opener in Spain at the start of this month and the Olympic silver medallist topped that by clinching gold on Friday.

The short course format made its debut in the Czech Republic, featuring 12 gates rather than the usual 21, and Burgess triumphed after missing out on the final last time out in Spain.

The 32-year-old, who helped GB win the C1 team gold at last month's European Championships, beat Slovenia's Ziga Lin Hocevar while Olympic champion Nicolas Gestin of France claimed bronze.

There is one round left in the World Cup series, which takes place in Tacen, Slovenia, from 29-31 August, before the final is held in Augsburg, Germany, from 4-7 September.

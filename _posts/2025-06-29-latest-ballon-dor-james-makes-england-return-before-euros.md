Let's dive into the details: Lauren James is the sister of Chelsea captain Reece James

Europe, take note - Lauren James is back. 

After three months out with a hamstring injury all it took was eight minutes for James, 23, to make an impact, planting a pinpoint cross on the head of Alessia Russo to help England to a dominant 7-0 victory over Jamaica.

And her return could not have come at a better time. With England six days away from taking on France in their opening Group D game at Euro 2025, Sarina Wiegman's "special player" is fit and raring to go.

She turned heads with three goals and three assists at the World Cup two years ago, and now the Chelsea forward looks ready to play a pivotal role in England's pursuit of glory once more.

The competition for places in Wiegman's front line has never been higher as the Lionesses look to defend the European crown they dramatically won in 2021, but James may be the key.

In 2021, James was a tricky winger whose talent was waiting to be unlocked, but now she is earning comparisons to one of the all-time England greats Kelly Smith.

Former Lioness Karen Carney didn't hold back in her praise for James on ITV: "She can do things I've never seen any player since Kelly Smith do. She's Ballon d'Or." 

James' performance in the number 10 role will be giving Wiegman an almighty headache before Saturday's game against France.

Manchester United's Ella Toone started the match in the role and bagged herself two goals, but James lit up the King Power Stadium with her ability to glide past players like they aren't there and pick out passes others didn't see.

Ex-England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's hard not to get excited [about James]. I think she needs to be managed in the right way and giving her some time, a glimpse of what she can offer this Lionesses midfield and attack is really exciting. It's mouth-watering stuff.

"For me, she's a little magician in midfield. Her natural movement, the unpredictability and shooting ability that she has. She looks like she's going about her own business in the midfield.

"For me, it's the nonchalance. She picked up some great areas, gets on the ball, takes a shot and it just looks so easy for her."

Who will win Euro 2025? BBC pundits make their predictions

It was a huge boost for England having James back out on the pitch but is she ready for 90 minutes against France? Probably not with just half an hour of game time after three months out.

Two-time Euros winner Wiegman knows patience is key with James: "Of course we're still building her. She has worked so hard to get to where she is right now - at Chelsea first and in the last two weeks with us. 

"She did every single training session and did really well. This was the first time she could get minutes and we hope to keep building her going into the France game."

With just 32 of the 894 minutes she has played this term coming in the last three months, James is lacking match sharpness and may be utilised from the bench against France on Saturday.

Toone, 25, has nearly 1,000 more minutes than James this season and has always delivered in an England shirt - especially at the Euros.

But it may not be as simple as a battle between James and Toone for a starting XI spot, with the Chelsea forward's versatility meaning Wiegman can use her off either wing or even as a false nine. 

"We also know there's a lot of competition going on up front and also in midfield. We will figure that out," added Wiegman.

Figure it out and England may be on their way to back-to-back Euros wins.

England fans expressed their delight at the return of James as the Lionesses get ready to jet off to Switzerland. 

Rob, Sussex: Lauren James is on a whole different level five minutes on and she's sent in three world class balls, you have to pray she's fit for all the games, best in the world.

Bob: Lauren James, pure class.

Clare: So good to have both Lauren Hemp, Lauren James and Georgia Stanway back from injury. Three huge plusses for our Euro chances.

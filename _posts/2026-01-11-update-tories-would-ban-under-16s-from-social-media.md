Let's dive into the details: The Conservatives say they would ban under-16s from accessing social media platforms if they were in power, promising to follow the example of Australia, which was the first country to introduce the policy. 

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said if her party was in government, smartphones would also be banned in schools. 

It has been a month since Australia's ban on under-16s using major social media platforms came into force. 

The Conservatives say that if elected, they would follow suit to try to protect children's mental health and education, and to stop them from viewing harmful content online. 

The party wants social media companies including TikTok and Snapchat to use age verification tools to prevent under-16s from accessing their platforms.  

The Tories say the scope of the policy would be kept under review. 

Badenoch said the age restriction would protect children while still giving adults choice. 

Separately the NASUWT teachers' union also called for a similar ban (after taking evidence from its members). 

The government does not currently support the idea but insists it is taking action to ensure children are able to access only age-appropriate content online.

Since July last year, platforms have been required to prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography under the Online Safety Act. 

Enforced by Ofcom, the media regulator, platforms that do not comply with the legislation risk fines, jail time or, in very serious cases, a ban in the UK.

This spring, the government is expected to issue guidance to parents around how long children under the age of five should spend watching TV or looking at computer screens.

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said around 98% of children were watching screens on a daily basis by the age of two, with research suggesting that higher screen use in this age group was linked to poorer language development.

The terms of reference for the national working group, which will be led by children's commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza and Department for Education scientific adviser Professor Russell Viner, will be published on Monday.

Parents, children and early years practitioners will all be involved in developing the guidance, which will be published in its first iteration in April.

The education secretary has insisted it will be "shaped by parents, not dictated to them".

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Chelsea won the FA Cup, League Cup and went 22 games unbeaten to win the Women's Super League title in Sonia Bompastor's first season in charge

Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor says one of the first questions she is often asked in job interviews is whether she can lead a top club while also being a mother.

Bompastor, who has four children, led Chelsea to a domestic treble last term.

When asked about a recent survey that found 78% of women had faced discrimination while working in football, Bompastor said she was "not surprised".

"Guess what was almost the first question everyone is asking me when I want to become a head coach or a manager?" the 45-year-old said.

"So I'm going to tell you - 'do you think it's possible to be a mum of four kids and being a manager for a high club?'

"I think if you have a man in front of the same people, they will never ask that question."

She added, laughing: "It wasn't the case in Chelsea."

A survey, external released on Wednesday by Women in Football said that discrimination for women working in the game was "persistent and widespread".

It found that 63.5% of women working in football experienced sexist banter or jokes, while 56% said no action was taken after reporting gender-based discrimination in the workplace.

Bompastor added: "We still have room for improvement in that area, and I'm glad the people are honest and they are brave enough to raise that."

Arsenal boss Renee Slegers, who was also asked about the survey, agreed "there is still a lot of work that needs to be done".

"I think we need to stay critical, although there's been a lot of progress in that sense. It's not always in the big things, it can be in the small things as well. It's good to be aware of it," Slegers said.

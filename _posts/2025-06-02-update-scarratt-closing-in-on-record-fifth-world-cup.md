Here’s what you need to know: Emily Scarratt hit a wonderful line and showed sharp footwork to score an individual try in the 2014 World Cup final

Centre Emily Scarratt is closing in on a record-equalling fifth Rugby World Cup after being named in England's 42-player training squad for the tournament.

The 35-year-old has played in the past four World Cups for the Red Roses and is aiming to become the first English rugby union player to play at five of the tournaments.

Loughborough Lightning's Scarratt, who has been capped 118 times, attended her first World Cup as a 20-year-old - with England losing the final to New Zealand at Twickenham Stoop in 2010.

Scarratt scored 16 points in the 2014 final win against Canada in Paris, including the game-clinching try in a player-of-the-match performance, before starting England's past two World Cup final defeats by New Zealand.

In the men's game only three players; Samoa's Brian Lima and Italy duo Mauro Bergamasco and Sergio Parisse have played at five World Cups.

In the women's game, former New Zealand fly-half Anna Richards was part of five World Cups between 1991 and 2010, winning the title four times.

Fiao'o Fa'amausili also won four World Cups for the Black Ferns across her five tournaments, from 2002-2017. Scotland's Donna Kennedy also played at five World Cups - her first coming in 1994.

Hosts England are favourites to win the World Cup, which gets under way on 22 August.

They defeated France 43-42 in a thriller at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham in April to secure their fourth consecutive Six Nations Grand Slam.

Megan Jones has established herself as John Mitchell's starting outside centre, but Scarratt - despite missing out on England's matchday squad for the Grand Slam win over France - remains a valuable squad member in a position where competition for places is high.

The Red Roses are on a 25-game winning run as they count down to their home World Cup, which starts against the United States at Sunderland's Stadium of Light.

The squad assembled on Monday for the first time and will be cut down to 32 players for the tournament.

England, who were world champions in 2014, narrowly missed out in dramatic fashion at Eden Park in 2022 against New Zealand.

"We know how important and exciting 2025 is for women's rugby in England," Mitchell said. "Today is the start of little wins where we will work hard into the tournament."

Resilient England finally get test they needed

Gloucester-Hartpury forward Sarah Beckett is once again a notable omission from the squad.

The 26-year-old, who can play at lock or in the back row, failed to make the Red Roses' World Cup squad in 2022.

Beckett was included in Mitchell's Women's Six Nations squad earlier this year but failed to make an appearance because of a back injury, with the last of her 35 caps coming in last year's Six Nations.

Loughborough Lightning lock Cath O'Donnell is included and has returned to full training after missing the Six Nations and October's WXV1 campaigns with an ankle injury.

Uncapped England Under-20 duo Millie David and Sarah Parry are named after featuring in Mitchell's March Six Nations training squad.

Bristol Bears' David, 19, was this season's Premiership Women's Rugby joint top try-scorer with an impressive tally of 17.

Prop Mackenzie Carson (ankle), world player of the year Ellie Kildunne (hamstring), Exeter Chiefs wing Claudia MacDonald (knee) and Bristol Bears lock Abbie Ward (toe) will all continue their injury rehab in camp.

According to new developments, L-R: One of Liam Kelly, Scott Bain and Craig Gordon will start in goal for Scotland

Manager Steve Clarke has played down Scotland's goalkeeping crisis and is intent on setting up a "cup final" against Denmark in the second of this month's pivotal World Cup qualifiers.

Angus Gunn, who has started all four qualifiers, is missing through injury so Falkirk's Scott Bain - the 33-year-old who won the last of his three caps in San Marino in 2019 - returns for the games against against Greece and Denmark.

Clarke's choice in goal will be between Bain, Liam Kelly - who has made one League Cup appearance for Rangers this term - and Craig Gordon, who will be 43 next month and has not played at all this season.

Scotland are second in Group C after three wins and a draw and have already secured at least a place in the World Cup play-offs in March.

They are likely to need at least a point in Greece on 15 November to set up a winner-takes-all showdown at Hampden against Denmark three days later, given the group leaders have a superior goal difference and face bottom side Belarus next.

"We're in a good position. What we have to do is make sure we get the result we need in Greece to make the Denmark game a cup final," said Clarke.

"It's always a blow when somebody misses out with injury and Angus did well in the four games up until now.

"We were in the same position in September, when Angus hadn't been playing either. With goalkeepers, it's a different position.

"Quite often they're the number two or the number three with their clubs. As long you've got boys who train well, goalkeepers can be out of the team for a long time and when they're asked to go in, they'll be ready."

In-form Heart of Midlothian striker Lawrence Shankland has also been recalled and Clarke says that "if you need goals, Lawrence is your man".

The 30-year-old last featured for Scotland in the Nations League victory over Poland 12 months ago but returns along with defenders Ross McCrorie and Josh Doig as Scotland seek to reach the World Cup finals for the first time since 1998.

Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Falkirk), Craig Gordon (Heart of Midlothian), Liam Kelly (Rangers)

Defenders: Josh Doig (Sassuolo), Grant Hanley (Hibernian), Jack Hendry (Al-Etiffaq), Aaron Hickey (Brentford), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Dinamo Zagreb), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Kieran Tierney (Celtic)

Midfielders: Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lewis Ferguson (Bologna), Ben Gannon-Doak (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Napoli), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Kenny McLean (Norwich City), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Lennon Miller (Udinese)

Forwards: Che Adams (Torino), Lyndon Dykes (Birmingham City), George Hirst (Ipswich Town), Lawrence Shankland (Heart of Midlothian)

Kieron Bowie of Hibernian misses out to make room for Shankland's return, with Che Adams of Torino, Birmingham City's Lyndon Dykes and George Hirst of Ipswich Town the other strikers in the squad.

Shankland has formed a fine partnership up front for Hearts with new signing Claudio Braga this season, with his goal in Saturday's 4-0 demolition of Dundee taking him top of the domestic scoring charts.

Bristol City's McCrorie, who made his sole Scotland appearance against Gibraltar last year, returns to provide additional cover at right-back, with Aaron Hickey only just back from the injury he sustained during the last international window.

Derby County's Max Johnston has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a hamstring injury while Nathan Patterson of Everton needs a hernia operation.

Sassuolo's Doig - one of six Serie A-based players named in the 25-man pool - missed out on the October squad but was a part of the group in September and will vie for the left-back position with captain Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney.

The eight midfielders named by Clarke are the same as those in the squad for the hard-working victories against Greece and Belarus in October.

Billy Gilmour came off after 38 minutes of Napoli's 0-0 draw with Como at the weekend but takes his place in the squad alongside club-mate Scott McTominay.

Lawrence Shankland tops the Scottish Premiership goalscoring chart this season with seven for leaders Hearts

Clarke has rewarded Shankland for a stunning start to the season that has the Hearts captain already on 10 goals.

"Lawrence has been good. He's hit the ground running again this season, his team are flying at the top of the league," Clarke added.

"Lawrence is getting his goals. If you need someone in the squad for goals, Lawrence is your man.

"In these two games coming up we're going to need experienced players and Lawrence has certainly got that experience to help us.

"I have a good relationship with most of my players. We are always very honest with each other. He's a striker who lives on goals, thrives on goals.

"He's in a good place and when you've got a striker in a good place scoring goals, it's important to get them involved."

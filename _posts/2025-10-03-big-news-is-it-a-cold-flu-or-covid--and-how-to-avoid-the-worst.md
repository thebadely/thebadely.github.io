Experts revealed that Chances are you know someone coughing and spluttering - hopefully not directly on you -  right now. 

There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds as autumn draws in.

But why now, how do you know if it's more than just a cold and how can you avoid the worst.

Medical doctor Dr Oscar Duke, who is also a regular TV presenter including on the BBC's Morning Live, shares his top tips.

Research on the extent to which cold weather impacts our immune systems remains unclear.

But darker days mean we typically make a beeline for warm, cosy, indoor spaces.

And this environment is perfect for viruses.

It's also when young children get back together at school after the summer holidays.

School and nursery can be like a petri dish with lots of viruses circulating and they may well bring these germs home with them.

The same applies to freshers in university halls - where mixing together spreads germs, while heavy drinking and partying further weaken the immune system.

Colds

Flu

Covid

Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid, overlap.

But there are some clues that might help you identify the exact culprit.

If a cold's coming on, then it often does so gradually. 

It's going to affect your nose and the back of your throat, while some will get a tickling at the back of the mouth.

Another early warning sign can be a build-up of pressure in the ear. 

If the virus spreads further, it can reach your lungs and cause a pesky cough.

Mostly however, these symptoms don't stop us from carrying on as normal.

The same can't be said for flu, which typically adds aches, fevers and muscle weakness into the mix. 

Flu doesn't mean you have to go to bed, but it might make you feel that way.

Since the pandemic, Covid has complicated things further, with similar symptons to flu.

But one key Covid-specific identifier can be a loss of smell or taste. Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a "razor-sharp" sore throat. Diarrhoea is also common.

The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. 

However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice.

Our bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. 

It's  crucial to take the free annual flu jab if you're offered it.

Eligibility is staggered across the population to prioritise those most at risk.

If you have small children who were two or three on 31 August this year, then they are entitled. Older children will be offered theirs at school.

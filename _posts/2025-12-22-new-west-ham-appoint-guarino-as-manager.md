Here’s what you need to know: Rita Guarino has not managed outside of Italy

Women's Super League side West Ham have appointed Rita Guarino as manager following the sacking of Rehanne Skinner.  

Guarino, who is taking up her first management job outside her native Italy, has signed an 18-month contract.

She was in charge of Inter Milan between 2021 and 2024, having previously led Juventus to four successive Serie A titles.

The 54-year-old has also worked as head coach of Italy's Under-17s.

Skinner was sacked by West Ham on Thursday after winning only one of their 11 Women's Super League matches this season.

"I'm so happy to be joining West Ham. It is a club with a big history and strong values that align with my own," Guarino said. 

"I'm really excited by the project here. There is a lot of talent and experience in the team and I want to support the girls to develop as individuals but also as a collective."

West Ham's appointment of Guarino, a relative unknown in England, is a bold move.

One of her first priorities will be to navigate the January transfer window as the Hammers look to move up the WSL table. They currently sit second-bottom, two points above Liverpool.

"I want to build a team that is organised, aggressive with the ball, and tries to recognise and use space. The mentality of the team - the togetherness  and hard work - is the most important thing," she added. 

"I'm looking forward to the chapter ahead in the best league in the world."

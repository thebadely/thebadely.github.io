Experts revealed that Manchester Thunder are the third team to qualify for this year's Netball Super League play-offs

Manchester Thunder edged past Cardiff Dragons 59-54 to secure a top-four finish in the Netball Super League.

Elmere van der Berg top-scored with 37 goals at Belle Vue Arena on Friday as the hosts joined London Pulse and Loughborough Lightning in reaching the play-offs.

Victory for Thunder moved them up to second in the standings on 28 points, but they trail leaders Pulse on goal difference.

Goal shooter Georgia Rowe scored 26 for Dragons, who remain bottom after losing all but one of their 12 matches so far. 

Defending champions Lightning host fifth-placed Nottingham Forest on Saturday, while Pulse face Leeds Rhinos and Birmingham Panthers take on fourth-placed London Mavericks on Sunday.

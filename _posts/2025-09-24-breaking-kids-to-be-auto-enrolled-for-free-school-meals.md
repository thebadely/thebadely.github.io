According to new developments, Automatic enrolment for free school meals is being introduced in Cornwall, the county's council has announced.

The move, agreed at a meeting of the council's cabinet, means from September families who are eligible for Free School Meals will no longer need to apply, the council said.

It comes as an annual report from the Director of Public Health revealed more than 27,000 children and young people in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly were growing up in relative poverty.

Cornwall Council leader Leigh Frost said the automatic enrolment - which would be introduced from September 2026 - was about "making a real difference" to children and families in the county.

Frost said: "Right now, we know that as many as 1,800 children could be missing out on the support they're entitled to.

"By investing in auto-enrolment, we can put almost £900,000 directly back into family budgets every year, while also bringing nearly £2 million in additional Pupil Premium funding into Cornwall's schools."

Councillor Thalia Marrington, portfolio holder for community safety and public health, said the the council had "a responsibility" to respond to the public health report with "urgency, compassion and ambition".

Councillor Hilary Frank, portfolio holder for children, families and schools, said: "What makes this report particularly powerful is the way it lifts up the voices of children and young people.

"It reminds us that poverty is not an abstract concept but something that shapes lives now, daily, as well as future opportunities."

Cabinet also approved plans to develop a budget and financial strategy.

Councillor Adam Paynter, deputy leader and portfolio holder for resources, said the council would need to make "significant savings of between £45 and £70m" in order to reach a balanced budget for 2026/27.

"Unless there are significant changes to government proposals, we will not see a significant increase in funding. 

"There will however be increased costs," he said.

"That makes it more critical than ever that our funding is directed to where it's most needed and is in line with our political priorities."

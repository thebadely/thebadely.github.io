It has been recently reported that Rising demand for services has led an NHS trust serving Suffolk and Essex to declare a critical incident. 

East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust told the BBC it was facing "significant pressure", including hospitals in Ipswich and Colchester. 

Earlier this month, the NHS reported a rise in flu and other winter viruses after Christmas. 

The trust has encouraged people to seek help from pharmacists or use NHS 111 where appropriate.

Adrian Marr, interim chief executive at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said: "Like many hospitals across the country, we are seeing increased demand for our services. 

"There is significant pressure on our hospitals, and we have declared a critical incident at the trust.

"Our dedicated staff are working very hard to continue to offer safe, compassionate care for our patients, and our volunteers are also supporting teams."

He continued: "We're really grateful for everyone bearing with us during this busy period. 

"Patients' families are playing an important role by supporting their loved one return home when they're well enough, which in turn helps free up beds for the next patient who needs our care."

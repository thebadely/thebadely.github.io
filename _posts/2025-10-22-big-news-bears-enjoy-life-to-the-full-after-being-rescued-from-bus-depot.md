Experts revealed that Two bears rescued from "deplorable conditions" in Armenia by an East Sussex charity have been making the most of their new lives in a bear sanctuary.

Giant Siberian bear Max and Syrian bear Minnie were living in a bus depot for the entertainment of travellers until they were saved in 2018. 

The rescue operation was carried out by International Animal Rescue (IAR), based in Uckfield, and the Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets in Armenia.

Alan Knight, IAR president, told the BBC it was "heart-warming" to see how healthy and playful Max and Minnie were "after years of cruelty and neglect". "They are seizing a second chance to enjoy life to the full," he added.

The IAR said it took a year to persuade the bears' captor to agree to their release. 

Mr Knight said the pair had been kept in a cage that had been welded shut for more than 10 years.

"Being kept in such a small cage and knee deep in excrement, we couldn't get into the cage to rescue them," he said.

As Max weighed 500kg (1,102 lb) he had to be moved in a horse trailer while Minnie was transported on a deep bed of straw in a transport crate.

Mr Knight said Max had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before emergency services cut through the bars of the cage using angle grinders.

"The bears were kept in deplorable conditions and we were desperate to set them free," said Mr Knight.

The charity said Max and Minnie have learnt to forage for food hidden in their enclosure in the wildlife rescue centre in Urtsadzor, and are responding to natural bear instincts, including going into hibernation.

It adds the bears are regularly treated with fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. 

The keepers say Max is the "playful one", enjoying tree-climbing, tossing logs and balls into the pool and "keeping everyone entertained". 

Meanwhile, Minnie leaves the hard work of shaking apples out of the wobble tree to Max, while waiting patiently to retrieve her share of the fallen fruit.

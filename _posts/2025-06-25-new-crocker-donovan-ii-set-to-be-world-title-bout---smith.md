Experts revealed that Lewis Crocker could meet at Windsor Park on 13 September

Matchroom Boxing chief executive Frank Smith is "very confident" the rematch between Lewis Crocker and Paddy Donovan will be for the vacant IBF welterweight title and that "we are moving in the right direction" for the fight to take place at Windsor Park.

Saturday, 13 September has been floated as a potential date for what would be the first all-Irish world title fight.

The first meeting between the pair took place on 1 March, drawing a sell-out crowd of 8,500 at Belfast's SSE Arena for what was touted as a final eliminator for the title, held by Jaron 'Boots' Ennis.

"Any day that should be finalised," Smith told BBC Sport NI when asked about the rematch having world title status. 

"That will obviously add a big storyline to the fight. The first fight ended in controversy and this is their chance to prove who deserves to get that win and become world champion. 

"Hopefully in the coming days we'll have an update on that and confirmation from the IBF that it'll be for a full world title."

In the first fight, Crocker won via disqualification at the end of the eighth round when, having twice previously been deducted points for fouls, Limerick's Donovan was thrown out for punching after the bell.

An appeal from Donovan's team resulted in the IBF granting a rematch which again would be a final eliminator.

However, in a twist last week, champion Ennis confirmed he is to move up to the light-middleweight division.

Smith was in Belfast on Wednesday to meet with officials from the Irish Football Association (IFA) to explore the possibility of the rematch taking place at Windsor Park, and said discussions have been "positive".

It is understood the IFA is keen on the idea, as is Communities Minister Gordon Lyons, but Smith admitted that financial support from from the NI Executive would "help make a decision easier" in terms of bringing the rematch to the home of the Northern Ireland football team. 

It would not be a first as in September 2014 the NI Executive provided support for Carl Frampton's world title win over Kiko Martinez at Titanic Slipways.

"Stadium fights are very difficult to make economic sense," Smith admitted.

"For us it's about putting on the best possible show and this fight deserves that. So, does it make economical sense? Probably not. Not often as a business do we make decisions that don't make economic sense and that's why everyone's support is needed.

"Quite honestly, it would be easy to take the event back to the arena and we know we can sell out that instantly, but we want to do things differently and bring huge events.

"The government is known to support events. You've got the golf [Open Championship] coming up in a few weeks from now, heavily supported by the government, so we're hopeful we can get support in some way, and from the stadium as well to get this over the line."

Rory McIlroy says he is now close to his Masters-winning form after putting himself in prime position for another Scottish Open title with an imposing third-round 66 to share the lead.

The Northern Irishman began the day four shots adrift of overnight leader Chris Gotterup but ended it alongside the unheralded American on 11 under.

The duo take a two-shot lead into the final day after English pair Matt Fitzpatrick and Marco Penge both bogeyed the last to card one-under 69s and drop into a share of third alongside Americans Wyndham Clark and Jake Knapp.

McIlroy has endured a "lull" since completing the career Grand Slam at Augusta National in April, but believes he is returning to his imperious best as he pursues a second Scottish Open triumph in three years.

Why having 'more fun' is now priority for McIlroy

He compiled five birdies - including on all three par fives - with his sole bogey coming on the seventh after having to hack out of a fairway bunker.

The world number two clearly revels in competing at the Renaissance Club - posting the joint-lowest round of the day and his 11th consecutive score of 68 or lower on these links.

"I think I'm pretty close to being back to the level I was at going into the Masters," said the 36-year-old.

"I think I've had a little bit of a lull, which I feel is understandable. When you do something that you've been dreaming your whole life to do, it was a huge moment in my life, my career.

"I think I just needed that little bit of time. And to be back here for last couple weeks, and feel like I could actually digest all of it, I feel like I came to this tournament with renewed enthusiasm and excitement for the rest of the year."

Gotterup, the world number 158, followed his course record-equalling 61 with a level-par 70.

And Clark matched McIlroy's 66 welcome to provide welcome relief amid his torrid season. 

The 2023 US Open winner has missed the cut in two of his past three events and mustered just one top-10 finish this year.

"It's just nice to be back in this position and let's see if I can go put a good round together and have four solid days of golf," said Clark.

"I've hit a lot of good putts all year and just haven't holed anything. Now it's nice to see the ball go in the hole. Made a couple adjustments and they seem to work."

Ludvig Aberg was jostling for the lead before a triple-bogey seven on the 13th was sandwiched by bogeys as he spilled five shots in a wretched three-hole stretch. 

The Swede's 71 leaves him four shots back.

World number one Scottie Scheffler is one further adrift after a frustrating 71 in which he had to wait until the 13th for a first birdie.

Frenchman Romain Langasque provided a wonderful moment with a hole in one on the 145-yard par-three 14th.

Having scraped into the weekend, defending champion Bob MacIntyre is one over after labouring to a 72.

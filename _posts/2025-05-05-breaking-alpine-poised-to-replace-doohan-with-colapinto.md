Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jack Doohan collided with Liam Lawson on the opening lap of the Miami Grand Prix

Alpine are poised to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto after just six races of the season.

The Australian's seat has been at risk since the team signed Colapinto from Williams over the winter.

Alpine refused to comment, but insiders say the switch is close to being finalised before the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola in Italy on 16-18 May.

The decision to switch the two drivers comes despite Doohan out-qualifying team-mate Pierre Gasly for the first time this season for the grand prix grid at last weekend's race in Miami. Doohan was also faster in qualifying for the sprint race in China.

He retired from the race after a collision with Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson.

Doohan has shown strong pace at times but has also had a series of incidents, including two heavy crashes.

He lost control in the wet on the first lap of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, badly damaging his car, and crashed on his second flying lap of practice at the Japanese event two races later.

The Suzuka crash came after Doohan failed to close the DRS overtaking aid before turning into the high-speed Turn One. 

Colapinto's graduation has been eased by money from Latin American sponsors.

The Argentine raced for Williams in nine grands prix last year after the team dropped American Logan Sargeant after the Dutch Grand Prix.

Colapinto impressed by scoring points in the Azerbaijan and US races but dented his reputation with heavy crashes at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix - in qualifying and race - and in qualifying at the Las Vegas.

He had also crashed in practice in Baku before scoring his breakthrough first points in the race.

Alpine signed Colapinto from Williams over the winter, leading to immediate speculation that he would eventually replace Doohan.

Williams team principal James Vowles has made it clear the team have the option to take him back in the future.

Doohan is expected to stay involved with Alpine.

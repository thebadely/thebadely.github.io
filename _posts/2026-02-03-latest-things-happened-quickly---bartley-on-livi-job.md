Let's dive into the details: Marvin Bartley has held various roles at Livingston

New Livingston manager Marvin Bartley only found out on Sunday morning when he arrived for training that predecessor David Martindale was stepping down.

The club announced on Sunday afternoon that long-serving Martindale would be moving into a sporting director role, the day after a 2-0 home defeat by Motherwell left Livi six points adrift at the bottom of the Scottish Premiership.

Bartley has been promoted from first team coach and takes charge for the first time at home to Falkirk on Wednesday, Livingston's 25th of 38 league games.

And Bartley had no hesitation in accepting the job during a conversation with Martindale.

"Things happened very, very quickly, extremely quickly," said Bartley.

"I spoke to Davie. He made it clear in terms of what was next for him and what the club wanted to be next for me.

"And then it was one of those situations. Is it something that you want to take on? Or is it something you prefer not to? I'm sitting here now as manager, so you can imagine what my answer was.

"I didn't expect it to happen. Probably the best thing about it, I didn't have any time to think. It's a privilege first and foremost, obviously. A club that I captained and then assistant manager before going away, and then coming back as first team coach.

"The buck now stops with me. I understand that and ultimately I have to prepare the players for each and every game."

Bartley was in charge of Queen of the South for 16 months but left in May 2024 after the Dumfries side finished seventh in Scottish League 1. He returned to West Lothian as a coach earlier this season.

"Sometimes a fresh voice, a fresh approach can kind of change things," Bartley said. 

"And that's what I'm hoping for, that we need to do. And we understand that we need to pick our results up very, very quickly.

"I had a conversation with him, as I was all the time, being one of his coaches. But, yeah, in terms of going forward, I think if Davie knew the recipe to make us win three points every week, then potentially we'd still be sitting here."

Martindale remains a strong voice throughout the club but Bartley says he will have sole control over footballing matters.

"I'll sort the training with the staff that are currently here," explained the manager.

"Match day, I'll pick the team, I'll pick the squad, I'll pick the substitutes that go on there. Will I lean on him? Of course I will. I'd be an idiot not to.

"He's managed so many games, especially at this football club, for a long, long time. So I'll probably lean on him more than he'd probably want me. I'll lean on him a lot. I definitely will."

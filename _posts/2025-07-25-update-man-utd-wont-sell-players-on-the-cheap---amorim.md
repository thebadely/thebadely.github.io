Experts revealed that Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim (left) greets skipper Bruno Fernandes at training in Chicago

Ruben Amorim says rival clubs might be in for a "shock" if they think they can sign Manchester United's unwanted players on the cheap this summer.

Amorim exiled his so-called 'bomb squad' - Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrrell Malacia - at the start of pre-season.

While Rashford has now sealed a "dream" move to Barcelona, the other four remain at the club and have been told to train back at Carrington, having been left out of United's squad for the three-game Premier League Summer Series in the United States.

Real Betis remain keen to bring Antony back after the Brazilian's impressive spell on loan last season, while Juventus are interested in Sancho but need to offload players first, and Garnacho has been linked with numerous clubs.

But no deals are imminent and the feeling persists that suitors will wait to the latter days of the transfer window, which closes on 1 September, in the belief the price will drop.

Amorim warned that will not be the case, and if those players have to come back into the fold, they will.

"[Technical director] Jason [Wilcox], [chief executive] Omar Berrada and the club have a number for these players," said Amorim.

"If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.

"Some players have to find a new place so we have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams.

"We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide.

"I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I'm ready to receive the players."

New signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon have arrived at United this summer, but the club still want a striker and a holding midfield player to address clear weaknesses in Amorim's squad.

While that might not happen, the former Sporting boss insists he would be happy if he has to face Arsenal in the opening game of the season with the current group of players he has at his disposal.

"At the moment, our club needs to be really careful when we sign a player," he added.

"So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy because all the players that are here want to be here - and that for me is the most important thing."

United have spent almost Â£130m on forwards Cunha and Mbeumo, believing the pair can supply the goals to fire them up the Premier League table from the dismal 15th place they ended last season.

For both players, the move represents a risk.

Cunha had interest from Tottenham and Arsenal but, having harboured an ambition to play for United as a boy, snubbed the chance of Champions League football to become part of the sizeable Old Trafford rebuild.

He knows the likely reaction to a below-par start to the season, and given United's opponents include Manchester City and Chelsea, in addition to Arsenal, in the first five games, the spotlight will be on immediately.

But Cunha doesn't care about that as the Brazilian, 26, said: "I really think the pressure of this club is not really pressure, it's a privilege.

"This is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and when Ruben came to me and said he wanted me to help put the club in the perfect times again, it was a challenge I wanted."

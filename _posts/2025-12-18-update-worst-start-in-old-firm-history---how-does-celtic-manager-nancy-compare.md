According to new developments, Wilfried Nancy has made the worst start by a Celtic manager in the club's 138-year history 

Following a torrid start, Wilfried Nancy has become the first manager in the history of Celtic and Old Firm rivals Rangers to lose his opening four matches at the helm. 

A 2-1 defeat at Dundee United on Wednesday night made it four losses from four since the Frenchman replaced interim chief Martin O'Neill just two weeks ago.

BBC Sport examines whether time is already running out for Celtic's beleaguered boss. 

Nancy oversaw a fourth loss in four games at Dundee United on Wednesday night

A trip to face a side you had not lost to in 23 meetings in all competitions should have been a vital turning point. 

Instead, the tumultuous start to Nancy's reign as Celtic manager slipped to an early nadir. 

The disappointing loss at Tannadice Park, having been ahead, was their first against Dundee United in more than a decade.

It meant Nancy surpassed the unwanted record of Tommy McLean, who lost his first three games in caretaker charge of Rangers in 1983.

Only four bosses in Celtic's 138-year history had ever lost their opening game - Jimmy McGrory in 1946, Gordon Strachan in 2005, Tony Mowbray in 2009 and Brendan Rodgers in 2016.

Prior to Nancy, no Hoops manager had ever lost two at the start of their tenure.

'Nancy must go', but 'board are to blame' - Celtic fans react

When Nancy's appointment was confirmed on 4 December, joining from Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew, Celtic had won seven of their previous eight matches under O'Neill, who had taken temporary charge after Rodgers departed.

Perhaps what hurts Celtic's fanbase the most about the poor performances and results since O'Neill's exit is that the Northern Irishman has subsequently indicated he would liked to have stayed. 

If there was an element of mitigation in Nancy's opening loss at home to Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts, and then in Europe against a Roma side currently three points off the top of Serie A, the two most recent defeats have incensed supporters.

First came the Scottish League Cup final - the first time Celtic had lost to St Mirren in 16 matches in all competitions. 

Celtic had won the two previous cup encounters - under Ange Postecoglou in 2023 and Rodgers in 2024 - by an aggregate score of 7-1.

But fans subsequently described being "out-fought and out-thought" by opponents who had only won the League Cup once before in their 148-year history. 

It was followed by the debacle at Dundee United, which meant Nancy - MLS Coach of the Year in 2024 - has won just three of his past 16 games as a manager after struggles at Columbus.

Celtic forward Daizen Maeda had a mixed performance in the 2-1 loss at Dundee United on Wednesday night

Following defeat at Tannadice, a defiant Nancy told reporters he had witnessed an "improved" performance. 

"I think I am in a good direction with the players," he said.  "Today you saw we had a good performance - we are improving."

The 48-year-old may point to an excellent chance missed by goalscorer Daizen Maeda and the ongoing absence of key players such as Alistair Johnston, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Jota, but problems clearly persist following his change in system to a back three.

This was also the first time Celtic have lost four games in a row since January 1978, during Jock Stein's final season as manager.

Celtic also lost the League Cup final that season and went on to finish fifth in the table, 19 points behind champions Rangers. 

Nancy, understandably, is trying to remain positive amid the fury and frustration.

But the underlying numbers are ominous - three goals scored and 10 goals conceded, with Celtic facing more shots on target and recording fewer of their own in comparison to games under Rodgers and O'Neill this term.

Former Chelsea boss Frank Lampard is the only manager of an ever-present Premier League club to lose his opening four matches 

Losing your first four matches as a manager is almost unheard of among the English Premier League's established sides.

Of the ever-present clubs to have featured throughout the competition - Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham - it has only ever happened once. 

Frank Lampard is the only such manager of those appointed during the Premier League era to lose his opening four fixtures, doing so during his second spell at Chelsea in 2022-23. 

He replaced the sacked Graham Potter in April of that season and went on to win just one of his 11 matches in charge.

Chelsea finished in the bottom half of the top-flight table for the first time since 1996, with a record low points tally of 44 and the fewest goals scored in the club's Premier League history. 

Nancy, theoretically, has more time with his reign starting much earlier in the campaign, but another unwelcome statistic looms on the horizon. 

Celtic have only ever lost five games in a row on two occasions in the club's history, most recently in 1953 under McGrory.

If the Hoops were to match that mark of 72 years ago on Sunday - against an Aberdeen side they have not lost to in 32 meetings - the writing may be on the wall for Nancy.

According to new developments, Jannik Sinner has been the men's world number one since June last year

When Jannik Sinner lifted the Australian Open trophy in late January, nobody knew we would not see him on a court again for over 100 days.

Three weeks after his third Grand Slam triumph it was announced the world number one had accepted a three-month ban for failing two doping tests in March 2024.

Sinner had been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol.

But the 23-year-old Italian was subsequently told he should bear responsibility "for [his] entourage's negligence" and received a suspension which ends on Sunday night.

With Sinner set to make his comeback at the Italian Open in the coming days, BBC Sport explains how he has not been usurped at the top of the ATP rankings and what has been happening over the course of his ban.

When Sinner steps back on court in Rome this week, he will still be ranked as the world's leading men's player.

Defending the Australian Open title opened up a huge gap of 3,695 points to Germany's Alexander Zverev - the player Sinner beat in the Melbourne final.

But, with four Masters tournaments to be played in Sinner's absence, it appeared there was ample opportunity for Zverev or Carlos Alcaraz to dislodge him.

From his ostracised position, Sinner watched both of his nearest rivals fumble the chance to significantly narrow the gap.

By losing another Grand Slam final, Zverev had fallen short again in his quest to finally land a major title. It weighed heavily on his mind.

The 28-year-old German was beaten by American qualifier Learner Tien in the Acapulco second round, by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor in the Indian Wells second round, and by France's Arthur Fils in the Miami Open fourth round.

Losing his opening match in Monte Carlo did irreparable damage, rendering his Munich title insignificant in his pursuit of Sinner.

Zverev believes the possibility of becoming world number one did not have an impact.

"I was just playing bad, to be honest," he said.

"Australia did affect me and there was a lot of things that, in my mind, I was not playing well."

Alcaraz, already a four-time major champion before his 22nd birthday, had even further ground to make up.

The Spaniard started positively by winning the Rotterdam title, but a series of defeats in Doha, Indian Wells and - most damningly - Miami halted his momentum.

It meant Alcaraz was unable to regain top spot, even though he went on to win Monte Carlo and reach the Barcelona final last month.

Constant talk of chasing Sinner had a negative influence on him.

"Since Jannik's ban started, a lot of people asked me about how important the moment was to reach number one again," said Alcaraz.

"I was thinking too much about it, instead of playing my good tennis and enjoying the time that I stepped on the court."

Instead of another dominant player emerging, Sinner's absence produced a carousel of champions - including Britain's Jack Draper and Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, who both won their first Masters titles.

It means Sinner returns to an ATP Tour that has been blown wide open.

With Alcaraz injured and 37-year-old Novak Djokovic struggling, the current landscape appears to provide an opportunity for Sinner - who reached the French Open semi-finals last year - to hit the ground running.

Inside the doping deal for tennis' world number one

Sinner does not deserve any hate - Draper

Sinner is sure to receive a hero's welcome when he returns at the Italian Open.

Support from his compatriots has never wavered during the doping controversy, demonstrated by the 'Sinnermania' which swept the ATP Finals in Turin last year.

The man from the mountains in northern Italy enjoyed the greatest season of his career in 2024 - and one of the best in recent memory - so it is little wonder he is held in high esteem at home.

The reception might be frostier in the locker room, however.

Sinner has talked about how he felt "uncomfortable" around his peers at the Australian Open.

"It was a bit like some players looked at me differently and I didn't like it at all," he told Italian broadcaster RAI.

Three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka was among many players who criticised  the way Sinner's case was handled, while plenty of others felt the timing of his ban was convenient.

British number one Draper was one of a few players who did publicly back Sinner, reiterating his support in late April and saying the Italian "doesn't deserve any hate".

While Sinner is not allowed to play competitively until Monday, he has been able to play some tennis.

From the start of the ban until 13 April, he could practise at a private training base - as long as he did not come into contact with other professional players.

Speculation surfaced in March he had been hitting with Dominic Thiem - the recently retired 2020 US Open champion - after the pair were pictured having dinner together in Monte Carlo.

However, Thiem laughed off the suggestion.

"I think for him and his level, I would not be [good] enough," Thiem told BBC Sport.

Under Wada rules, Sinner could start 'official training activity' from 13 April.

Sinner invited Draper - a friend he has played doubles with on the ATP Tour - to Monte Carlo for several days of practice sessions on the clay.

Asked about Sinner's level, Draper told BBC Sport: "He's very consistent, he's playing great.

"Maybe a little rusty in some areas, but with time he's improving every day. The more points we played, the more he was getting better.

"It was great to be around him for a few days and get some good sparring."

Sinner was surrounded by his trusted team in Monaco - coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill, plus fitness trainer Marco Panichi, physio Ulises Badio and osteopath Andrea Cipolla.

Draper said the trip was strictly business.

"I didn't speak to him too much to be honest," added the 23-year-old world number six, who lost to Sinner in last year's US Open semi-finals.

"On the court, Jannik is always very professional â he's number one for a reason.

"He seemed in good spirits, had a great team around him and great people who have supported him through a tough time."

Once Draper moved on to the Madrid Open, Sinner enlisted the help of Norwegian teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer in practice sessions.

Off the court, Sinner has spent time with his family back in Italy and has pursued his other interests outside tennis.

Shortly after the announcement of his ban, he was pictured sitting alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Milan Fashion Week.

According to a source close to Sinner, the player has been enjoying skiing, biking and go-karting between tennis sessions in recent weeks.

"I think he is feeling refreshed â tennis is very relentless. I'm sure he will come back to Rome and the rest of the year in fine form," said Draper.

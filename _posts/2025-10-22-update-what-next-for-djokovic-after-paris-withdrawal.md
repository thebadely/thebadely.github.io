It has been recently reported that Novak Djokovic has played just 12 tournaments this season - but only trails Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in the ATP race

Novak Djokovic pulling out of the upcoming Paris Masters without giving an explicit reason provides more uncertainty about his plans for the rest of the season.

The 38-year-old Serb was hampered by injury in his most recent ATP tournament, the Shanghai Masters, where he lost to qualifier Valentin Vacherot in the semi-finals.

Djokovic also had to retire from his match against Taylor Fritz at the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last week.

On Tuesday, the 24-time major champion announced he had decided to withdraw from the Paris Masters, the final ATP 1000 event of the season which starts next week.

"Dear Paris, unfortunately I'll not compete at this year's Paris Masters," Djokovic wrote on social media.

"I have amazing memories and great success over the years, especially being able to conquer the title seven times."

Djokovic 'not giving up on Slams' - but can body keep up?

Djokovic's statement did not offer any reason why exactly he is not playing, but he hinted in Saudi that he would skip Paris in order to potentially elongate his season.

Appearing at an ATP 250 event in Athens - a tournament owned by his family and relocated from Belgrade - is Djokovic's main focus. 

It looks unlikely he will miss an event with such an emotional pull unless his physical problems are too great. 

Following that is the season-ending ATP Finals in Turin.

Djokovic has qualified as the third best player on the men's tour, behind Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, despite only showing up at only 12 tournaments this season.

Skipping an event he has already won seven times might be a more logical decision for Djokovic, who has repeatedly emphasised how creating further "history" is his priority now.

After pulling out of the Saudi match, Djokovic was non-committal about his upcoming schedule.

"Now it's rest and really addressing some of the issues I have with my body," said the world number five.

"Then hopefully playing the last couple of tournaments of the season, let's see."

It has been clear throughout the season that Djokovic's ageing body is, understandably, not able to withstand the rigours needed to win the sport's biggest prizes as well as it used to.

He still has the technical quality to challenge most of the ATP Tour, demonstrated by reaching the semi-finals at all four majors this year.

Djokovic was not able to complete his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev, which came three days after he courageously beat Alcaraz while hampered by a leg injury.

He also moved into the last four at the French Open and Wimbledon, but faded physically after being unable to break down Sinner.

At last month's US Open, Djokovic acknowledged he "ran out of gas" in a three-set defeat by Alcaraz.

Winning a 25th major - moving him clear of Australia's Margaret Court as the sole record holder - is the biggest priority in the twilight of his career.

Achieving that goal at the season-starting Slam in Melbourne, where he is already a record 10-time men's champion, is his next key target.

Now Djokovic has to decide whether prolonging - or curtailing - this season will help his ambitions in 2026.

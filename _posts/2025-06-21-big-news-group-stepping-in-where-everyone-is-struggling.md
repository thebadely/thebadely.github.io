According to new developments, Jane Platt's bright pink polo shirt marks her out as a volunteer at the Big Venture Centre.

The community shop provides discounted items and other help to people living in some of the most deprived areas of Wolverhampton.

Places like Bushbury, Heath Town and Low Hill, where Ms Platt believes "everyone is struggling", including herself. 

The local council insists it is there for those who need support, but some living in the areas say they feel forgotten. 

"My baby won't play out in the streets," explained Ms Platt, who lives near the Scotlands Estate. 

The 45-year-old has been volunteering at the centre for years and said it helped her gain skills and look after her own mental health. 

But she claimed it was also one of the only places she felt safe in the area. 

"You can't look at people when you [are out]," Ms Platt said. 

"I try and look the opposite way because you just don't know what they're going to say."

Tracey Walters, a resident being supported by the Big Venture Centre, was born in the area. 

The 61-year-old said she liked living there but felt it had been "forgotten" about.

She demanded more activities for younger children on the estate, and was also concerned about rubbish. 

"I don't think Wolverhampton Council care about this area," she said.  

The council said there was more than Â£121,000 in funding for children in the Scotlands during the school holidays, adding it received regular litter picks and sweeps. 

The local authority also insisted 112 jobs involving roads and street lighting had been carried out. 

But another centre user, who asked not to be named, said it looked "scruffy". 

The woman, who has lived in the area all her life, said drugs and other forms of anti-social behaviour were a big problem, often because young people did not have anything to do.

"It used be nice area at one time but there's nothing left," she claimed. 

"It's just empty houses that get smashed up. You find needles on the floor [and] nobody cares." 

Despite the issues, volunteer director David Chadwick insisted the Scotlands was a place where "everybody will help everybody". 

"Without us a lot of families would suffer and that's why we're here," he said. 

City of Wolverhampton Council said it was working with police and other organisations to make sure the area was safe and nobody was "left behind". 

"The council has awarded millions of pounds in regeneration grants in the area and created The Big Venture centre by a community asset transfer," a spokesperson said. 

"We hold regular community resident meeting where people can talk directly to the council."

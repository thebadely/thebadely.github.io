According to new developments, Jockey Sam Ewing on the Gordon Elliott-trained Favori De Champdou after winning the Paddy Power Chase

Trainer Gordon Elliott claimed two Grade One wins as part of a four-timer on the second day of the Christmas Festival at Leopardstown on Saturday, with jockey Sam Ewing also winning two of the major races.

Elliott-trained Favori De Champdou battled back under Ewing to beat stablemate Search for Glory to win the Paddy Power Chase after Skylight Hustle had earlier won the Novices Hurdle for Elliott, with Jack Kennedy the victorious jockey on that occasion.

Solness, ridden by Ewing, took victory for trainer Joseph O'Brien in the Club Chase Steeplechase in the other Grade One race of the day over the Irish course.

Solness (8-1) repeated his victory of 12 months ago in the same race as he edged out Marine Nationale (2-1) by half a length.

The two horses were involved in a thrilling four-way battle at the front as they jumped the final fence, with Ewing's mount proving an effective frontrunner for trainer O'Brien.

Having his first race of the season, Barry Connell-trained Marine Nationale overcame the setback of hitting the third of the 11 fences, with jockey Sean Flanagan doing well to stay in the saddle and then get his horse into contention on the run-in.

"He's tough as nails and he loves racing at Leopardstown," winning trainer O'Brien told RTE after the race.

Pre-race favourite Majborough (6-4) finished third.

Meanwhile Skylight Hustle took full advantage after Talk The Talk fell at the final fence to clinch a success in the two-mile Novices Hurdle, the fallen horse having landed too steeply and unable to keep his balance.

Kennedy had moved the eventual winner stylishly into contention but his mount looked booked for second when Joseph O'Brien's challenger quickened impressively to lead by half a length going to the last.

Ewing, who stepped in for the concussed JJ Slevin was on board Talk The Talk, so could have been in line for a remarkable three Grade One victories in a day, having ridden Favori De Champou and Solness to victory. 

Skylight Hustle, the 3-1 favourite, came home with five lengths to spare over Carrigmoornaspruce (12-1), with Love Me Tender (4-1) in third.

"The horse travelled like a dream the whole way and jumped like a buck," Elliott told RTE after watching his horse Skylight Hustle pass the winning post.

"I thought looking at it live that we were beat, but when I looked at the re-run, I wasn't sure [with] the way my lad galloped from the last to the line.

"Jack said when he came in 'I can't guarantee I would have won but I definitely wasn't beat'. He said he really liked the way he went from the last to the line.

"It happened to us yesterday [when El Cairos fell when in front at the last] but that's why it's called jump racing.

"He's a good horse and I think he'll stay further as well. I'd imagine he'll come back here for the Dublin Racing Festival."

According to new developments, Plans to open a banking hub in a church building have been revealed.

Bank-owned Cash Access UK has applied to temporarily convert an "underused office" to the east of Crowthorne Baptist Church on High Street in Crowthorne, Berkshire, into the hub for up to three years.

The hubs provide cash and basic bankingÂ services from a number of banking brands, with staff available to help customers in person.

Bracknell Forest Council has validated the application and a decision is yet to be made.

The banking hubs have become essential for areas where bank branches have closed down.

More than 150 have now been opened across the UK.

In a cover letter, agents Ridge and Partners LLP called the Baptist church "an important place of worship and a community facility".

"For this application, Cash Access is seeking to convert a small portion of the building, currently an underused office, into a temporary cash hub located to the east of the building, away from the church itself and the community hall.

"This is to ensure that there is a local bank operating within the high street for all community residents, whilst Cash Access look for a more permanent building."

Experts revealed that Malou Marcetto has previously played for Dijon and Brondby

London City Lionesses have signed Denmark midfielder Malou Marcetto on a two-and-a-half year deal from Madrid CFF.

The 22-year-old has represented her country at youth level, including 10 appearances for the under-23s, and has been a target for the Women's Super League side for a while.

"The facilities are great and the people I've met have made me feel really welcome," said Marcetto.

"England [is] the biggest football country, in my opinion. Women's football is growing here and it's going to be a very competitive league to play in.

"I'm really excited to be here and get started. In terms of my playing style, as a midfielder, I like to be creative and also work hard."

It is believed London City originally hoped to bring her in when her contract expired in the summer, but have been able to finalise a deal in this window for a small fee.

The club, which is currently sixth in the WSL standings, believes Marcetto brings high potential to the squad and provides added first-team competition.

Having recently appointed Spanish manager Eder Maestre, Liga F has become a familiar hunting ground for London City and Marcetto is a player they hope to develop for the future.

She previously played in Denmark's A-Liga for Brondby, before joining Dijon in France's Division 1 Feminine.

While at Madrid CFF, Marcetto scored five goals and assisted seven in 40 league appearances.

London City's transfer policy this year has been to build a squad with a mixture of high-potential young talent and a sprinkling of big-name stars.

They have already signed France international striker Delphine Cascarino in this window, but are not expected to bring in any more before Tuesday's 23:00 GMT deadline.

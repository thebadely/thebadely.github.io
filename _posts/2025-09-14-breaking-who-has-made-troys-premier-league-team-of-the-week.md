Hereâ€™s what you need to know: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Gianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City):  There is a lot of expectation on a wonderful goalkeeper who is one of the best in world football. There was talk that this might be City looking beyond Pep Guardiola, but the save he made from Bryan Mbeumo was who he is - a world-class save to keep United at nil and he just gets up like 'that's what my job is'.

He is a solid, reassuring presence that adds a whole new layer to City moving forward. He will be a guy that gives confidence to the rest of the team because he can always get them out of trouble.

Jurrien Timber (Arsenal): He has been sneaky good this year. It looks as though he is fully over his injury and helped Arsenal to another clean sheet with a dominant performance defensively against Nottingham Forest. He is a real top player.

Nordi Mukiele (Sunderland): Helped his team to a clean sheet with a strong and dominant performance. He injected life to his team and helped everyone else.

Cristian Romero (Tottenham): Another one that drives standards. He was a beast against West Ham and delivered a real leader's performance. He helped everyone else be that little bit better and stronger. It is something you look out for from a fellow professional.

Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa): I have given him a bit of stick recently, but after an iffy start against Beto he was solid and helped Aston Villa come away from Everton with a 0-0. He was excellent and prevented Everton from having too many clear-cut chances.

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea): The midfield is the easiest part of the team to pick. Caicedo produced a wonderful strike against Brentford. He is one of Chelsea's best players every single game and improves levels in the team.

Pape Matar Sarr (Tottenham): Under Thomas Frank, Sarr seems to have got a bit more freedom to go forward. He showed high energy and was bursting past people. I know he is young and has more to do, but he seems transformed and is getting better and better.

Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal): The technique on the first of his two goals against Nottingham Forest was frightening. It would have been so easy to get over that and put it into Row Z, and his header was nice as well. We see so many players that can't head a ball any more and it was really calm. He ran the show and that is why Arsenal brought him in. They want him to be that maestro when they have loads of the ball.

Kevin Schade (Brentford): He scored, but what a shift he put in. Everything he did was intense and about getting Chelsea on the back foot. If Brentford are to stay up he will have to produce a lot more of those types of performances.

Phil Foden (Manchester City): The Manchester derby was a game that was suited for Foden. Everyone has had question marks over him for the last 12 months, which has been fair, in terms of what version of Phil Foden are we getting. Because you could not deny his talent, but the consistency and level of performance dropped. He was excellent against Manchester United, started with a bee in his bonnet. It was good to see him smiling and playing well.

Erling Haaland (Manchester City): At one point on Sunday he was on five touches in the opposition box and two were goals and one had hit the post. It just shows what a monster this chap is. We were talking about Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres all summer and everyone forgot about Haaland. He is the best poacher and goalscorer in world football. He scores goals. That is what he does.

Thomas Frank (Tottenham): It was not some big shock to see Spurs beat West Ham. But if you look at the start they have made, they have only lost one game and he is raising standards. He has rotated the squad and got the best out of the people coming in and still managed to keep the likes of Richarlison and Brennan Johnson happy.

Even at the end of the game you can see him demanding more from his players.

Let's dive into the details: A care home has been ordered to pay more than £200,000 after two wheelchair users drowned and a third was seriously hurt when a leaking boat capsized during a day trip.

Exeter Magistrates' Court heard Burdon Grange Care Home, near Beaworthy in Devon, failed to carry out basic safety checks before taking six residents to Roadford Lake, near Launceston, Cornwall, in June 2022. 

The group hired a "wheelyboat" designed for wheelchair users but it took on water and flipped, trapping the victims in their heavy electric wheelchairs, the court heard.

Former rugby player Alex Wood, 43, and Alison Tilsley, 63, died and their bodies were recovered two days later. Kate Dart survived with serious injuries.

The court heard that Ms Dart, who is in her 50s, was found face down in the water.

District Judge Stuart Smith called the case "devastating, harrowing and absolutely tragic".

He highlighted the home's "complacency about risk" and "false sense of security" in relying on the boat hirers to carry out safety checks.

The court heard the victims were strapped into wheelchairs with no way to escape. 

The judge heard no lifejacket could have supported the weight of Mr Wood in the chair he was unable to be released from.

One staff member who could not swim became trapped under the boat for 15 minutes. 

Mr Wood, a father of four, moved to the care home after he was injured in a rugby accident in France in 2011.

His wife Tamsin broke down in court, saying: "Alex's death has broken me.

"I feel cheated. I wanted to make Alex better and bring him home.

"That has been taken away. I loved Alex so much."

His father Peter said the family was "deeply troubled and hurt that his death could have been avoided".

The Marine Accident Investigation Branch later found the boat had not been properly maintained, allowing water to leak in and destabilise it.

Burdon Grange Care Home Ltd admitted three charges of failing to provide safe care under health and social care laws. 

It was fined £180,000, with £20,000 costs and a £190 victim surcharge. 

Catherine Campbell, deputy director of the Care Quality Commission in Devon, said after the case: "The failure of the provider, management and staff to identify and address clear dangers was unacceptable and placed highly vulnerable people at serious risk of harm."

Burdon Grange said in a statement after the case: "We recognise the pain and distress this boating tragedy has caused the families, relatives and friends of Alex and Ali whose losses are still profoundly felt by our community.

"Our priority now is to move forward and consistently deliver the high-quality care and support our residents and their families rightfully expect."

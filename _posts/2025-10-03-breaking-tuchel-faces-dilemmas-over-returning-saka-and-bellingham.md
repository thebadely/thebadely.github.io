Let's dive into the details: Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka are key to England's chances of winning the World Cup

Thomas Tuchel will name his latest England squad on Friday and it may give him his toughest decisions yet since taking charge.

The Three Lions produced their best display by some distance under his leadership when they beat Serbia 5-0 away from home in Belgrade last time out. 

Tuchel had said he was convinced his side were moving in the right direction and he was proven right in that impressive performance.

But now, with injury issues and stars returning to fitness, the German has some big calls to make.

Jude Bellingham missed the last England international camp as he recovered from shoulder surgery.

The 22-year-old is a key player for England, arguably the best they have, and their chances of winning the World Cup next summer will likely be hinged on how well he plays.

It could be a slightly awkward reunion for Tuchel and Bellingham for this camp, too.

The England manager apologised for describing the midfielder's on-field behaviour as "repulsive", saying he used the word "unintentionally", and also spoke to the Real Madrid player at the time.

The big decision is about what Tuchel does for the friendly with Wales on Thursday, and the away World Cup qualifier with Latvia the following Tuesday.

Tuchel is a big fan of Aston Villa midfielder Morgan Rogers and has played him in a variety of positions in his four matches in charge, including a deeper midfield role, on the right wing, as a striker against Senegal and also in his favoured number 10 role.

Rogers was one of the stars of the 5-0 win last month and produced a quality assist for Noni Madueke's goal.

Bellingham and Rogers get on well, but both of their favoured positions are as the most advanced in a three-man midfield.

Rogers can also play from the right and left wing but, with Bukayo Saka occupying the right side and Marcus Rashford liked by Tuchel from the left, Rogers may be unlucky to drop out.

Bellingham has only made one start for Real Madrid since returning from injury and Tuchel may opt to share the minutes between the pair for this international break.

However, he will want to start building what he considers his best XI with just three international breaks left before preparations for the World Cup start.

There's also a similar call to make on the right wing between Arsenal team-mates Madueke and Saka.

Madueke has been one of the standouts for England during Tuchel's time in charge.

However, just like at Arsenal, he has to contend with being behind Saka in the pecking order.

Saka has only played one game for Tuchel since he became England manager, because of fitness and hamstring injuries, and that was England's 3-1 defeat by Senegal in June.

The 24-year-old recently returned for Arsenal and scored in their 2-0 win over Olympiacos on Wednesday.

Saka's 12 goals for England would make him the third-highest scorer in the squad behind Harry Kane (74) and Rashford (18).

He is one of England's most reliable goal threats and, like Bellingham, Tuchel will want him to settle into the England side he is building - with games running out.

Tyrick Mitchell (centre) has been more of an attacking threat for Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner

England's left-back position has been a problem area for several years.

Tuchel has played Myles Lewis-Skelly in three of the five World Cup qualifiers but left the Arsenal full-back out of the squad for the impressive win over Serbia.

It was a tactical decision, balanced alongside the fact that Lewis-Skelly at that point had not played 90 minutes for Arsenal this season, with Riccardo Calafiori making the left-back position his own.

Tino Livramento excelled in Belgrade and, with his versatility and physicality, looked to be an ideal candidate to play for Tuchel in that role long term.

However, the Newcastle defender has now been ruled out for up to eight weeks following a knee injury he picked up in the defeat by Arsenal on Sunday.

One option could be Crystal Palace defender Tyrick Mitchell. The defender has not played for England since March 2022 but is a key component of an unbeaten Eagles side.

There are no questions about Mitchell's defensive abilities but one of the possible things that has led to Tuchel not calling him up is the perceived questions about his attacking output.

Now, however, Mitchell plays as a wing-back and is utilised as one of Palace's attacking outlets in Oliver Glasner's 3-4-2-1 system.

The games this window are again ones which England should win, but Tuchel will know how valuable time is with his players as the World Cup gets closer.

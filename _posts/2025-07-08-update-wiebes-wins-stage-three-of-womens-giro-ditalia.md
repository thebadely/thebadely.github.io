Here’s what you need to know: Lorena Wiebes sealed the 106th win of her career in Trento

Lorena Wiebes won the third stage of the Women's Giro d'Italia, but Great Britain's Anna Henderson held on to the pink jersey for the overall leader.

The Dutch cyclist saw off competition from British rider Josie Nelson, who took second place for Team Picnic PostNL in Trento.

Weibes was led out by her SD Worx-Protime team-mate Lotte Kopecky, who finished third in a race that saw a mass crash with less than 3km to go, leaving only 10 riders at the front.

All riders involved in the crash received the same time as Wiebes due to the 3km rule, meaning Henderson, riding for Lidl-Trek, stayed at the top of the general classification by 13 seconds.

However, Switzerland's Marlen Reusser shaved two seconds off the Olympic time-trial silver medallist's advantage in the third stage.

"Winning at the Giro d'Italia Women is always special, and this victory confirms how well the season is going," said Wiebes.

"Kopecky and I were very lucky not to get caught in the crash, and then (team-mate) Barbara Guarischi did an exceptional job bringing us back to the front."

Here’s what you need to know: Ruben Loftus-Cheek could make his first appearance for England since 2018

Ruben Loftus-Cheek says he "completely forgot" about playing for England and was "just a fan" during his near seven-year absence from the national team.

Loftus-Cheek's last appearance for the Three Lions came in a friendly against the United States in November 2018 after he had been part of Gareth Southgate's World Cup squad that reached the semi-finals in Russia the same year.

The 29-year-old midfielder ruptured his Achilles in 2019 playing for Chelsea in a friendly in the USA before the Europa League final, and subsequently dropped out of the England reckoning.

He joined AC Milan in 2023 and has made 71 appearances for the Rossoneri in all competitions, scoring 11 goals and registering three assists.

"When I ruptured my Achilles, I was on such a high [before it happened], so after that I had a hard time mentally," said Loftus-Cheek.

"But I was still young, I still had time to come back, so I wasn't too low."

He added he had "got used" to not joining up with England because he had been away for so long.

"You still want to push in club football with the hope of maybe getting a sniff," he said.

"But I just completely forgot about it and was being a fan of the team instead."

Loftus-Cheek said it took about two years for him to feel himself again after the injury.

"If you have got good people around you it is going to help you so much, but the main thing comes from your self drive," he said of his recovery.

"That belief, to overcome challenges, is paramount in sport and in life - that you have this mentality in overcoming challenges."

When Tuchel asked Loftus-Cheek to play wing-back...

England boss Thomas Tuchel knows Loftus-Cheek well from his time as manager of Chelsea, where the German used him in some unconventional positions.

"When he [Tuchel] came into Chelsea and he spoke to me about playing wing-back, I said no way - but I ending up playing there anyways," said Loftus-Cheek.

"I played many positions under Tuchel and he values my physicality so I am used to working under him.

"He is very intelligent and knows the game so well. Hopefully we can do well to connect with him."

As well as playing Loftus-Cheek at right wing-back, Tuchel also deployed him at centre-back and in midfield.

Loftus-Cheek thought he would be in with a "shout" of getting called up to the England squad as he knew the manager would be "keeping tabs on him".

However, he was philosophical when asked if his versatility would give him a shot at making the World Cup squad next year.

"Who knows. I am able to play different positions. Since I was at AC Milan I have played a lot higher and close to the striker to get goals and help the team in the final third," he said.

"Under Tuchel I played a lot deeper. I am able to do that and with things that can happen in a tournament, being versatile is a good thing. When it comes to that I am happy to play anywhere for the team and do my best in any position."

England play two World Cup qualifying games in this international break with the first against Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday before travelling to play Serbia next week.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Retail sales rose in June as warm weather boosted fuel and supermarket sales, according to official data.

Sales volumes increased by 0.9% in the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Supermarkets reported people buying more drinks, while fuel sales were up as consumers "ventured out and about in the sunshine", the ONS said.

But it said sales had fallen more in May than it had previously estimated.

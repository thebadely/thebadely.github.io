Let's dive into the details: Lewandowski had been Poland captain since 2014

Michal Probierz has resigned as Poland manager in the wake of Robert Lewandowski saying he would not play for the country under him.

Lewandowski, who is Poland's record goalscorer with 85 goals in 158 appearances, quit his national team on Sunday after Probierz replaced him as captain with Piotr Zielinski.

Probierz's decision to resign also follows Poland suffering a 2-1 loss in Finland in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday.

The defeat left Poland third in their group on six points after three games, with the Netherlands second on six points after two games and Finland top on seven points having played four games.

"I have come to the conclusion that in the current situation the best decision for the good of the national team will be my resignation from the position of coach," Probierz said in a statement., external

"Performing this function was the fulfilment of my professional dreams and the greatest honour in my life."

Probierz, 52, took over as coach in September 2023 but his side finished bottom of their group at Euro 2024 and were the first country to be knocked out of the tournament.

In his 21 matches in charge he won nine, drew five and lost seven.

He added: "Thank you, of course, to all the footballers I have had the pleasure of meeting along the way.

"I will keep my fingers crossed for all of you, because the national team is our common national asset."

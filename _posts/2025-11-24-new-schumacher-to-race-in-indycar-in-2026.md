Let's dive into the details: Mick Schumacher achieved a career-best grand prix finish of sixth in Formula 1

Former Formula 1 driver Mick Schumacher will race in the 2026 IndyCar Series with the Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (RLL) team.

The 26-year-old, son of seven-time F1 champion Michael Schumacher, left his role as Mercedes reserve driver at the end of the 2024 season.

The German joined Mercedes after being dropped by Haas in 2022 - having made 43 F1 starts - and had hoped for a return to the grid next season, but was rejected by the Sauber/Audi and Alpine teams.

In 2024 and 2025 he raced for Alpine in the World Endurance Championship, achieving three podium finishes in 16 starts.

"Having both an F1 and an endurance background, and having competed in various racing series over the years, I have insights and knowledge that I am sure will contribute to a great partnership," Schumacher said.

Team co-owner Bobby Rahal said: "His test with us on the IMS road course was exceptional, he impressed every single team member. 

"Everyone walked away from that event determined to do what we could to bring Mick into our programme. We're thrilled he's chosen to join us, and we can't wait to get to work."

Schumacher will drive the number 47 Honda alongside RLL team-mates Graham Rahal and 2025 Rookie of the Year Louis Foster.

The 17-race 2026 season begins with the Firestone Grand Prix in St. Petersburg, Florida, on 1 March.

Experts revealed that Girmay won the Tour de France's green points jersey in 2024

History-making African cyclist Biniam Girmay has signed for NSN Cycling - the new team co-owned by World Cup winner Andres Iniesta.

Eritrea's Girmay became the first black African to win the Tour de France's coveted green jersey and win stages in 2024.

Iniesta, who scored the winning goal in Spain's 2010 World Cup triumph, co-owns the sports and entertainment company Never Say Never. 

Girmay joins NSN Cycling on a three-year deal, moving over from the Belgian Intermarche-Wanty Gobert team with whom he also enjoyed winning a stage of the Giro d'Italia and the cobbled classic Gent-Wevelgem in 2022.

"I'm really happy to be here, especially with a new atmosphere and a new beginning, for me and for the team," the 25-year-old said. 

Girmay is one of the most talented riders in the pro-peloton, excelling in one-day races or single stages of Grand Tours over rolling terrain and a sprint finish - thanks to his ability to engage huge power through the pedals.

He joins a team who already boast sprinting talent that includes Britain's Ethan Vernon and Jake Stewart.

"Looking at the team's sprint train, they were always really strong," added Girmay.  

"I'm really looking forward to working together."

Biniam Girmay: Africaâs new cycling hero

Girmay joins a team with a storied recent history, as Israel-Premier Tech. 

The team, which was co-owned by Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams since 2014, had come under fire from riders, sponsors and pro-Palestinian protesters this year, relating to the Israel-Gaza war.

The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll is now 70,100.

Adams has close ties with the Israeli government, and once proclaimed himself the self-appointed ambassador to Israel, as well as accompanying government representatives on a trip to the White House during US President Donald Trump's first term in office.

The protests during September's Vuelta a Espana extended to disrupt the whole three-week race, with the final stage in Madrid cancelled during chaotic scenes, which included some riders being pushed off their bikes by protestors. 

One of the team's best riders, Canada's Derek Gee, left the team, saying riding for them "weighed heavily on his conscience", and subsequently claimed to be the subject of a 30m euros lawsuit against him over his contract.

The team have never confirmed any details of the dispute other than it being with world governing body the UCI's arbitration board. 

BBC Sport understands the arbitration process is ongoing despite the change in team ownership. 

Title sponsor Premier Tech eventually withdrew its support, along with bike supplier Factor before Iniesta's company, who he owns with Joel Borras, took full financial control and registered the team in Switzerland with a "Spanish structure".

One of the appeals for Girmay will have been a been the potential doubling of his salary, which was believed to have been more than a million euros a year at his former team, making him one of the highest paid riders in cycling.

Another is the team's ongoing association with community projects, such as the building of a cycling track in Rwanda. 

He says: "In Eritrea, cycling is our culture â it's in our blood. And as an African rider, I want to develop African cycling. This team already did incredible things [as Israel Premier Tech]. 

"We need people who can give opportunities, bring riders to Europe, or give them the facilities they need."

Let's dive into the details: The Indian Premier League was staged its first match since Punjab Kings v Delhi Capitals was abandoned on Thursday, 8 May

The Indian Premier League's return from suspension was spoiled by the rain, as the match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders was abandoned without a ball bowled.

The game in Bengaluru was set to mark the return of the competition after it was suspended for a week because of tensions between India and Pakistan centred on the region of Kashmir.

Many fans attended the M Chinnaswamy Stadium wearing cricket whites, after the home side's hero Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket last week.

However they were forced undercover by persistent rain, with both sides taking a point for a no result.

Defending champions Kolkata can now no longer qualify for the end of season play-offs, with the sixth-placed team having needed to win both their remaining games to progress.

Meanwhile RCB move top of the table on 17 points and have now qualified for the play-offs.

They have two games remaining and are a point clear of previous leaders Gujarat Titans, who have a superior net run-rate and a game in hand.

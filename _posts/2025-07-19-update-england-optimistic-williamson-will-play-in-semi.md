It has been recently reported that Leah Williamson (left) has started every game for England at the past two European Championships

England are "very optimistic" Leah Williamson will face Italy in the Euro 2025 semi-finals, says fellow defender Esme Morgan.

Captain Williamson went off in extra time of their quarter-final win over Sweden on Thursday - which went to a penalty shootout - after rolling an ankle.

She was seen using crutches and wearing a protective boot, which is believed to have been precautionary. 

England manager Sarina Wiegman said in her post-match news conference that Williamson would be assessed before they face Italy on Tuesday at 20:00 BST. 

Morgan is one of the most likely replacements for Williamson should she be unavailable.

"She seemed in very high spirits this morning. I want what's best for the team, and that's absolutely having our captain on the pitch," said Morgan.

"It is the same as every single game - be prepared to play if I'm needed, know the role, just be absolutely ready and train at a high level over the next few days. But we're very optimistic that Leah will be fine."

Morgan made her tournament debut against Sweden, coming on in the 70th minute to help England bounce back from a 2-0 deficit.

"It was really, really special. Apparently my mum was sobbing when I came on, bless her. It doesn't take much to set her off watching the football," said Morgan. 

"I think she was crying again when we won, so a lot of tears were shed. It was just really nice to get that opportunity.

"I have been working hard throughout the tournament to stay prepared if I was called on. I felt really ready when that happened to be able to make an impact. 

"I was really excited and to be able to turn it around and get the win at the end was such a joyous moment."

Esme Morgan's half-time England admission

England will play in their seventh women's Euros semi-final, having progressed from two of the past three - in 2009 and 2022.

They are the first reigning champions to reach a semi-final since Germany 12 years ago.

Wiegman is looking to reach a third successive final, having done so with the Netherlands in 2017 and England in 2022.

Asked about England's regular success at major tournaments, Morgan said: "When you speak to Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood about it, because they've been part of many tournaments, it's amazing speaking to them about the journey and the things that have changed.

"It's a big source of pride that England have got to the latter stages of this tournament.

"We've had three must-win games that we've come through now. It's exciting for the fans back home to get through to these stages of the tournaments."

Williamson has 62 caps for England and has started every match at the Euros under Wiegman, captaining the side to success in 2022 before helping them reach the semi-finals in Switzerland.

She is a key player, particularly in the absence of World Cup captain Millie Bright, who took on the armband when Williamson was ruled out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury in 2023.

Since her return, Williamson has enjoyed success with Arsenal, producing a standout individual display in the final as they won the Champions League.

As well as possessing strong passing ability, and a good reading of the game, Williamson made a key block in England's penalty shootout win over Sweden.

Before the tournament, fellow defender Maya Le Tissier said of her leadership: "Leah is a bit more reserved but when she's speaking, you really listen. 

"She knows what she's talking about and she's won a lot now. I feel like she leads in a quieter way and by example with what she does."

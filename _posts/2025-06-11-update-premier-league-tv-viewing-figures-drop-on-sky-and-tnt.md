Here’s what you need to know: Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk became the first Dutchman to captain a side to the Premier League title

Premier League television viewing figures on Sky Sports were down 10% last season, with the lack of jeopardy in the title race and relegation believed to be behind the reduction.

It showed 128 games last season, while TNT Sports, which broadcasted 52 matches, had a 17% reduction in its year-on-year figures.

The drop in Sky viewers comes after two record-breaking seasons in 2022-23 and 2023-24, where Manchester City beat Arsenal to the title - the latter on the final day.

Liverpool wrapped up the title on 27 April this season, while Ipswich Town followed Southampton and Leicester City in being relegated to the Championship the day before.

While Sky says numbers tracked closely with the 2023-24 season, there was a drop off over the final six weeks of the campaign.

That has been blamed on the title race being settled early and no compelling relegation narrative at the other end of the table.

It is also thought Sky's new EFL deal, in which more than 1,000 games are broadcast a season, could have impacted Premier League figures with audiences offered more options.

Next season will see even more live Premier League matches on TV when a new record Â£6.7bn domestic broadcast deal starts.

Sky will show at least 215 top-flight games live, up from 128, including all games moved to Sundays because of clubs' involvement in European competitions.

TNT Sports will retain its 52 games, including the Saturday 12:30 kick-offs and two midweek rounds, but there will be no Amazon Prime coverage for the first time in six years.

A report last month said live sport, including football, was being pirated on an "industrial scale" by people illegally streaming.

Bosses of the major rights holders, Sky and DAZN, have previously warned piracy is causing a financial crisis in the broadcast industry, external.

The increasing cost of rights deals results in higher prices for fans at home, especially if they choose to pay for multiple services to watch their team play.

In April, Sky said Rory McIlroy's win at the Masters was the most-watched day in Sky Sports history, with a record peak audience of 1.85 million viewers - 37% of total TV viewership.

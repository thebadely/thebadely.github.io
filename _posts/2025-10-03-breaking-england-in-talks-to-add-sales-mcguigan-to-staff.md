According to new developments, McGuigan turned out for Glasgow, Exeter and Sale, alongside stints in South Africa and New Zealand, during his playing career

Byron McGuigan could be the latest addition to Steve Borthwick's England coaching set-up after the Rugby Football Union opened talks with Sale to bring in the 36-year-old.

McGuigan was seconded to England for their successful tour of Argentina and the United States this summer, working alongside Joe El-Abd on defence, the same remit he has with Sale.

However, Borthwick has since reshuffled his backroom, with senior assistant coach Richard Wigglesworth taking on defence, Lee Blackett recruited from Prem champions Bath to oversee attack and El-Abd looking after the forwards.

While an agreement is still some way off, McGuigan would have a role focused on the collision area with England. He would continue his work at Sale alongside his England duties. 

El-Abd initially had a similar arrangement when he first joined, splitting his time between England and Oyonnax

McGuigan retired as a player in 2023 after seven seasons and more than 100 appearances for Sale, and only became their defence coach in November.

Sale produced several landmark defensive performances under his guidance, notably keeping Bristol scoreless in a 38-0 success at Ashton Gate and restricting Saracens to a single try in a crucial April victory.

Born in Namibia and brought up in South Africa, McGuigan won 10 caps for Scotland, who he qualifies for through his mother, scoring three Test tries.

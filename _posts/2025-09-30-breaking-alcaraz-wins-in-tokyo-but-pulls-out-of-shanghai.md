Let's dive into the details: Carlos Alcaraz was making his debut at the Tokyo Open

World number one Carlos Alcaraz beat Taylor Fritz 6-4 6-4 at the Japan Open - before pulling out of this week's Shanghai Masters.

Alcaraz secured his eighth ATP title of the year in Tokyo.

But he then announced that he has withdrawn from the tournament in Shanghai, which starts on Tuesday, writing on Instagram that "the best decision is to rest and recover".

"Unfortunately, I've been struggling with some physical issues and, after discussing with my team, we believe the best decision is to rest and recover," he wrote.

The Spaniard twisted his left ankle during his opening-round match in Tokyo last Thursday.

But he showed no signs of an issue during the final, broke for 5-4 and served out for the first set against Fritz.

Fritz twice required treatment to his left thigh before returning for the second and Alcaraz seized the opportunity to pile on the pressure.

The American was broken twice and trailed 4-1 but did offer some resistance in the closing stages, chalking one of those off, but didn't have enough to stop the six-time Grand Slam champion.

Since losing against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon in July, Alcaraz has won three successive ATP titles - the Cincinnati Open, US Open and Tokyo Open.

But he will not take part in the tournament in Shanghai, where he reached the quarter-finals last year.

The Japan Open is Alcaraz's 67th win of the season as he closes in further on Sinner's tally of 73 wins in 2024.

Meanwhile, Sinner is through to the final of the China Open in Beijing after a 6-3 4-6 6-2 victory against Alex de Minaur.

Sinner is seeking his second title at the event after winning in 2023. He lost last year's final to Alcaraz. 

Learner Tien will be on the other side of the net in Wednesday's final after opponent Daniil Medvedev had to retire in the third set of their semi-final.

It is the first time the 19-year-old American has reached the final of an ATP Tour event.

Russian Medvedev won the opening set 7-5 but that scoreline was reversed as Tien fought back in the second.

Medvedev, who received a $42,500 fine for his behaviour at the US Open, struggled with cramp in the third and was involved in a heated exchange with the umpire after being warned for not giving his best effort.

"I'm giving my best efforts, I'm telling you," Medvedev told the supervisor.

"Who are you to decide? Why is every referee in the world trying to intimidate me? After the US Open, I'm trying to be good. This guy is doing that and I'm supposed to act good?"

World number 52 Tien was leading 4-0 in the decider when Medvedev retired.

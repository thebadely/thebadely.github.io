Here’s what you need to know: Doriane Pin (right) celebrating her F1 Academy title with Susie Wolff, the managing director of F1 Academy and Mercedes' F1 team boss Toto Wolff

Doriane Pin has been crowned F1 Academy champion in Las Vegas.

The 21-year-old Frenchwoman, who needed to finish the final race of the season in the top six to secure the title, came home in fifth

Dutchwoman Maya Weug, the only person who could beat Pin, was third.

The all-female series saw a dramatic final race weekend with Weug crashing during the formation lap in the first reverse-grid race, which Prema Racing's Pin won to extend her championship lead to 20 points.

Weug, who is in the Ferrari Driver Academy, gained two places on Pin in the final race but needed to win to have a chance of taking the title.

Mercedes protege Pin finished the season with 151 points, with Weug nine behind. 

This was the first time the F1 Academy raced in Las Vegas and F1 has recently extended its contract with the series for next season. 

Pin entered F1 Academy in 2024 but was beaten to the title last year by Britain's Abbi Pulling.

American Chloe Chambers converted her pole position to a race win in the second race of the weekend.

F1 Academy started in 2023 to provide a stepping stone into motorsport for women and to widen the appeal of the sport in an attempt to increase the pool of female drivers.

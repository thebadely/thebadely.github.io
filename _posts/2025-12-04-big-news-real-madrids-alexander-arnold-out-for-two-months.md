Let's dive into the details: Trent Alexander-Arnold joined Real Madrid from Liverpool in June

England defender Trent AlexanderâArnold will be out for about two months after sustaining a thigh injury during Real Madrid's win over Athletic Club.

The right-back, who has been limited to just 11 appearances in all competitions this season because of injury, provided his first La Liga assist in Real's 3-0 victory in Bilbao.

But Alexander-Arnold injured his thigh 10 minutes into the second half and required medical assistance to leave the pitch. 

Sources have confirmed to BBC Sport that the 27-year-old is expected to be sidelined for about two months. 

It is the latest blow to Alexander-Arnold, who joined Real from Liverpool in the summer and has already missed six weeks of the season with a hamstring strain. 

With Spain right-back Dani Carvajal also ruled out until early 2026, Uruguay midfielder Federico Valverde may have to fill in at full-back.

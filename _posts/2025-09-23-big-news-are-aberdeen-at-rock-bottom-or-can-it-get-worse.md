'This was rock bottom' - Thelin

Manager Jimmy Thelin says Aberdeen have hit "rock bottom" after an insipid defeat by Dundee United left them adrift in the Scottish Premiership. 

Ivan Dolcek and Vicko Sevelj struck either side of half-time for United to leave the Pittodrie side with just one point from their opening five matches, having failed to score in each of them.

Despite their Scottish Cup triumph in May, Aberdeen have won only four times in the top flight in 2025 and they were booed by the away end on the full-time whistle after a flat performance pock-marked with mistakes.

Thelin did not sugar coat the situation post-match, saying "this was rock bottom". 

The Swede added: "We can't go deeper than we are right now. We need to step up and not have this tension when we play. We're all too tense.

"We have to be more mature at the moments when the goals are scored and play the game another way."

Latest Aberdeen news, views & analysis

Thelin oversaw a significant turnover of players in the summer, as Aberdeen invested a large sum of money in reshaping the squad after their Hampden triumph.

However, the manager does not yet seem to have settled on his best team, with changes in midfield par for the course game to game.

Kevin Nisbet has struggled so far to replicate the impact he had while on loan last season, while Bologna loanee Jesper Karlsson has tried plenty without much coming off. Granted, both have only played three times so far.

Another deadline-day arrival, Stuart Armstrong, is short of match fitness but the 53-time Scotland cap grew into the game at Tannadice and hit the bar.

Thelin pointed him out as an example for others to follow when they face League Cup conquerors Motherwell on Saturday (17:45 BST).

"As individuals, I know the players can do better but we have to be more focused and trust our quality," Thelin said. 

"Stuart did really well, he has experience, there is a lot of expectation but he plays very composed and that's what we need to spread through the whole team.

"We need to find answers quickly. It is a big club with a big history and we have the chance to turn it around on Saturday."

Aberdeen fans berate Dons boss Jimmy Thelin

One only had to look at the away supporters that remained after the match at Tannadice to understand the discontent among the Aberdeen fanbase.

Thelin stood stony-faced with his players as fans booed and stood with arms wide, asking what has gone wrong.

"The fans are not applauding the players back, all they're getting is abuse," Aberdeen legend Willie Miller said on Sportsound. "There's nothing to be celebrated for Aberdeen just now.

"Even through the bad results last season, the fans stayed and applauded. But this season, they're away home before the final whistle. The next stage is usually a few banners and a wee demonstration outside.

"Thelin needs results quickly. Starting with Motherwell at Fir Park is a huge task."

Thelin says he understands the strength of feeling and insists it's on him and the players to provide some positivity on the pitch.

"It's tough," he said. "We shared with the supporters after the game that they're angry and frustrated with our performance and result.

"We need to find answers really quickly now to get the team going in the right direction and show our fans much more."

'There's nothing to celebrate for Aberdeen just now'

Olly: An Aberdeen manager losing their job after a loss to Dundee United? The ghost of Roy Aitken is peering over Jimmy's shoulder...

Alistair: Disgraceful that Dons fans are singing for Jimmy Thelin to be 'sacked in the morning'.  Don't bother coming back if that's how you feel.

Ross: We always question the manager but surely the players need to have some pride in what they do.players need to take responsibility and fight for the club in these tough times.

Malc: Tempting to bin JT in the morning - but let's not unless there's a genuine, viable, committed alternative lined up and ready to hit the ground running.

Martin: Thelin must go now, no improvement, ots baffling on why He cant get thus team motivated, I personally think there's something wrong in the dressing room, Thanks for the cup, Jimmy, but you need to go.

Dave: Change of formation and shape has to happen now for Thelin. He bravely changed to win the cup final and now has to change again, away from this failed 4-2-3-1 shambles.

Kevin: Sacking Thelin is not the answer, unless he fails to realise he cannot trust the likes of Jensen, Keskinen, Nilsen and Milne to convert the work they do in training in to live matches where it counts.

Matthew: We keep with the same formation that has failed us consistently since November. Five wins in 32 league games is the sort of form that doesn't give you any leeway. You can change personnel but it's the formation that needs to change. Which he's shown he won't. Thanks for the cup, Jimmy, but times up I'm afraid.

Graham: The message is simple now. Thelin is not good enough for AFC. Must go unfortunately.

Aldo: Thelin has to go. The tactics are terrible, a squad of supposedly creative players create no chances whatsoever. Beating a few lower division teams and a terrible Hearts, then a flukey win over Celtic on pens should not keep him in the job.

SPB: The rather bizarre Scottish Cup final gave him a stay of execution. He won't see out the year I'm afraid. His purple patch last year - when he blew a fantastic start - is all he has achieved in his tenure. He's not the only one who should be walking at the club.

Ally: Awful! Lazy and slow. No passion, no heart. I'm afraid the bell tolls for the Aberdeen manager. Faith in your shape has failed! Thanks for the cup, Jimmy, but fare thee well!

Denis: Board must act now. Give Leven a few games as he was up for it last year when acted as interim manager.

Neil: Can someone tell Thelin that performing the same experiment (formation) over and over again, and expecting different results, is the definition of insanity! Adapt, or go!

Andy: There's something much more wrong at Aberdeen than managers. Changing again will solve nothing. These players need to get honest.

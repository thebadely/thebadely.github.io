Experts revealed that A charity has laid on hot lunches for people struggling as temperatures plummet and the government warns of the effects of cold weather.

Good Shepherd in Wolverhampton supports vulnerable and disadvantaged people in the city, from rough sleepers to families living in supported accommodation.

Lucy Cox, fundraising and development manager, said food was provided throughout the year regardless of the weather, but at this time of the year it was "even more important".

She said it had been "business as usual" for volunteers, who offered people a warm space and a hot meal. The West Midlands saw freezing temperatures overnight and a dusting of snow. 

Ms Cox said the charity offered a range of services, but found the first time people came to them was for a hot meal. She said volunteers currently saw about 150 people twice a week.

"We say it starts with a meal," she said.

Good Shepherd also runs a breakfast club for rough sleepers three times a week.

Ms Cox said: "We're a trusted place within the city. People know that they can come to us for the support when they need it."

She said the charity relied on about 60 volunteers to run services.

Support from businesses was "invaluable, not only for that financial and practical support, but also to get the messages out there that our work in the Wolverhampton is absolutely vital", she added.

Other services include providing a homelessness outreach service, a family food pantry, a social enterprise cafe offering training and work for people who have faced homelessness and other barriers, and a community shop where people can buy items at affordable prices.

The aim was to provide "sustainable and lasting change for the people that need it most," she said.

A yellow cold weather warning issued by the Met Office for a large part of England and Wales was in place on Friday morning.

A further amber cold weather alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency remains in place until midday on Monday, as temperatures are forecast to remain low.

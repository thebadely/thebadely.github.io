Experts revealed that Two-time Olympian Ciara Mageean won European gold in the 1500m in Rome in 2024 

European champion and two-time Olympian Ciara Mageean has been diagnosed with cancer. 

The middle-distance runner, from Portaferry in Northern Ireland, said the diagnosis has "been a lot to take in", but added she is "ready to face this with the same fight I've always brought to the track".

Posting on Instagram, 33-year-old Mageean said: "To everyone who's been part of my journey so far, I have some difficult news to share: I've been diagnosed with cancer.

"It's been a lot to take in, but I've already started treatment and I'm incredibly grateful to be surrounded by the love and support of my family and close friends.

"Right now, my focus is on healing and taking things one day at a time. I kindly ask that you respect my privacy and that of my loved ones as we move through this together. Your understanding means more than I can say. 

"Thank you for the love and strength. I'm ready to fight this with the same fight I've always brought to the track."

Mageean has won gold, silver and bronze medals at the European Championships.

After recovering from a serious ankle injury, she came third in 2016 and was a runner-up in 2022 before topping the podium in Rome for Ireland last year.

Mageean made her Olympic debut in Rio in 2016 and competed at the delayed 2021 Games in Tokyo, where her preparations were hampered by a calf issue. 

She was set to race at the Paris Olympics last year as a reigning European champion but an Achilles injury ruled her out on the eve of her 1500m heat. 

Mageean's stellar career has also included a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, fourth place at the World Championships in 2023, and Irish records in the 800m, 1,000m, 1500m and mile. 

She was named the 2023 BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality of the Year after an impressive year, in which she broke national records and was fourth in a competitive World Championships final.

Olympic and world champion Femke Bol was one of many people to post messages of support for Mageean. 

The Dutch runner said she was sending her "love and strength".

Mageean's Irish team-mate Sarah Lavin said: "I don't have the words to send you. You are so loved and so strong and I wish I could give you the biggest hug."

Ireland's double Olympic boxing champion Kellie Harrington said "we all love you and will be praying for you and keeping positive spirits up for you".

European Athletics posted on X: "We're all behind you, Ciara. Everyone at European Athletics sends their best wishes to Ciara Mageean following her recent cancer diagnosis."

Portaferry GAA, who Mageean used to represent in camogie, said she is "truly an inspiration to so many people".

"We are all behind you in this fight," the club said.

"You and your family as always have our full support every step of the way. 

"We know you'll be back better and strong. We send our love and best wishes to you Ciara."

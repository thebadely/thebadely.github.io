Let's dive into the details: Shamrock Rovers players celebrate at the final whistle 

Shamrock Rovers booked a return to the Uefa Conference League group stage as a 0-0 draw against Santa Clara at Tallaght Stadium was enough to see them through.

The League of Ireland club led 2-1 from the first leg in the Azores when goals from Danny Grant and Danny Mandroiu gave them the advantage for the return in Dublin.

Stephen Bradley's team advanced from the league phase last season, only to lose out to Molde on penalties in the knockout phase, and they are guaranteed another six games in Europe this season.

It was a cagey start to the second leg with Santa Clara showing early ambition without creating anything clear cut, although Mandriou was forced to make an important block on Serginho.

The hosts came closest to opening the scoring in the first half when Josh Honohan cut on to his right before his shot came off the top of the crossbar.

Santa Clara upped the ante in the final 20 minutes as Rovers goalkeeper Ed McGinty was forced into a sharp reflex save to push a Vinicius Lopes shot over the crossbar.

Gabriel Silva had a couple of opportunities as the Primeira Liga side pushed to level the tie and force extra time, but despite the late pressure, Rovers held on to secure the result they needed as they return to the league phase for a second season.

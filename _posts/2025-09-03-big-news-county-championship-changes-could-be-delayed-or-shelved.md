Let's dive into the details: Surrey won their third consecutive County Championship in 2024

Any revamp of the County Championship may not take place until 2027 â if changes are implemented at all.

The 18 first-class counties have been examining the domestic structure throughout this season, with the intention of introducing alterations in 2026.

While a reduction to the T20 Blast was agreed in August, consensus on the future of the Championship has been harder to find.

Various proposals to cut from the current 14 matches to a 12-game programme were supported by the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA), but opposed by a number of counties.

As such, a 12-game schedule is off the table.

Now the choice is between 14 matches and 13 matches, options that were discussed by the county chairs on Tuesday.

The prospect of delaying any potential changes until 2027 has also been raised.

That is down to the desire to ensure the best possible decision is made, and also because the end of the current season is drawing near. The final three rounds of matches commence next week.

A 13-game season would involve splitting the 18 counties into a 12-team top tier, with six in the bottom division.

The 12 teams in Division One would be divided into two groups, with each team playing the others in their group twice. The groups would then be split into top and bottom halves, leaving each team to play the three counties in the corresponding half from the other group. The champions would be the county that ends on most points.

In the six-team second tier, counties would play two teams twice and three others three times, giving a total of 13 games. The top two teams would be promoted, replacing the two teams that finish bottom of the groups in the top tier.

Supporters of the change point to the one-match reduction, which is favoured by players. A 12-team top flight gives more counties the opportunity to win the Championship, while a six-team second tier gives more chance for promotion to those counties that often find themselves languishing.

However, there is also a feeling that the proposals are too convoluted and a 12-team top tier does not provide enough 'best v best'.

Any change to the structure would require 12 of the 18 counties to vote in favour.

That is looking increasingly unlikely, given the number of counties that have publicly stated their preference for retaining a 14-game season.

That would mean a continuation of the current system: 10 teams in the first division, eight in the second and all teams playing 14 matches.

Discussions between county chairs are due to continue and a vote could take place in the coming days.

The PCA is due to update its members on the situation later on Wednesday. In July, the players' body said a cut to 12 matches was the "only reasonable option".

With that now not being considered, the PCA is in favour of the reduction to 13 matches.

Retaining the current 14-game model would result in frustration among players. While the idea of strikes or boycotts are not likely to be considered, players could look at other ways of protesting against the schedule.

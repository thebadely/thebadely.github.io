According to new developments, Matheus Cunha has played 13 times for Brazil

Manchester United have agreed a deal with Wolves for the signing of Brazil forward Matheus Cunha. 

The 26-year-old is set to become United's first signing of the summer after the club activated a Â£62.5m release clause in Cunha's Wolves contract.

The former Atletico Madrid attacking midfielder will sign a five-year deal at Old Trafford, with the option of a further 12 months.

Cunha was in Manchester over the weekend to complete a medical with the club.

The deal, which is subject to visa approval and registration procedures, is expected to be completed once Cunha returns from international duty with Brazil later this month. 

Cunha left the Lowry Hotel in Salford on Sunday morning to join up with the national side.

Brazil face Ecuador on Thursday (Friday 00:00 BST) in a World Cup qualifier, which will be Carlo Ancelotti's first game in charge.

The forward scored 31 goals in 76 appearances for Wolves after completing a permanent move in 2023. 

He joined the club in a Â£35m deal from Atletico Madrid, following a successful six-month loan spell the previous season. 

Ruben Amorim is keen to strengthen United's attack this summer after the club's worst-ever Premier League campaign - they finished in 15th.

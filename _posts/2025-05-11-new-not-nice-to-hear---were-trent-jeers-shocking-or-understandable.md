Sad to see Alexander-Arnold leave Liverpool this way - Murphy

Boyhood Liverpool fan Trent Alexander-Arnold was standing on the Anfield sideline ready to make his 373rd club appearance, but there was something slightly different about this one.

For probably the penultimate time at Anfield - and the first time since announcing he will leave when his contract expires in June - the 26-year-old pulled on Liverpool red.

Real Madrid are expected to be Alexander-Arnold's next club. And a section of the Liverpool support took their first chance to let him know their feelings about his decision, booing him during the draw with Arsenal.

The jeers were mixed with cheers from other supporters, but former Premier League title winner Chris Sutton described the reaction as "shocking", while Alexander-Arnold's team-mate of eight years, Andy Robertson, told Sky Sports it was "not nice" to hear the boos.

"But you can't tell people how to feel," he added. "That's how I feel about it and I'm not going to tell anyone else how to feel about it.

"Disappointed to lose a good friend, he's an amazing player and an amazing person. He has pushed me through and made me a better player. His legacy will always be there, he's done so much for this club. 

"He will be missed for me as one of my best friends in the game. We've done it all together. He's took me to levels I never knew existed. It hasn't been an easy one for Trent but he has made the decision."

Arne Slot named Trent Alexander-Arnold as a substitute, with Conor Bradley starting at right-back

Liverpool boss Arne Slot told journalists at Fridayâs news conference that Conor Bradley would start at right-back, rather than the departing Alexander-Arnold - and it was then wondered whether he would be given any more minutes before leaving Merseyside.

But, with Bradley on a yellow card and Liverpool pushing to take all three points against the Gunners, Slot made the decision to introduce the England international.

He told BBC Match of the Day: "Everybody can have their own opinion and you can express it in any way you want to. 

"I heard mixed opinions but the only opinion I have is I owe it to the players and fans to try to win a game of football.

"And if Conor Bradley can't go on because he is tired and I have Trent Alexander-Arnold on the bench, I will bring him in because we want to win this game of football. And he was very close for us to win it because he had two or three passes... What makes him so special, for me.

"It is quite simple: If I want to win, I bring him in and that's what I did. For the fans, they are entitled to have their own opinion."

BBC pundit Sutton sympathised with Alexander-Arnold, who has won nine trophies with the Reds.

He said: "Trent Alexander-Arnold deserves far greater respect than he was shown today. What has he done wrong? He's won every trophy and wants a different challenge.

"It wasn't all Liverpool fans but it was shocking and embarrassing from the ones that did boo him."

Alexander-Arnold leaves as modern Liverpool great - but fans will feel hurt

How could Liverpool replace Alexander-Arnold?

In 2021, Alexander-Arnold put pen-to-paper on a four-year contract. Two years later, Jurgen Klopp made him vice-captain.

Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, told BBC Match of the Day: "I was expecting some negative reaction and I get why but I didn't expect the enormity it was. 

"I think it is sad for it to end this way. But he is a big boy, he mas made a decision. You can't please everyone all the time and he has to keep his head high."

Fellow Liverpudlian Jamie Carragher, who spent his entire career at Anfield, summed up the emotions of the fans.

"I think the manager will be shocked by how vociferous the reaction was," Carragher said on Sky Sports. 

"That might be his last game for Liverpool but, if frustrated with Trent, sing Bradley's name, sing Gerrard's name. Don't boo your players because it opens you up to criticism.

"Liverpool supporters think playing for Liverpool is the utmost and when you're a local player, like Trent is, like I was, you can't see yourself as bigger than the club.

"Supporters of any club wouldn't want to hear this, but most players in that dressing room probably want to play for Real Madrid.

"I've been in that dressing room, with players who have left us for Real Madrid or Barcelona.

"It's sometimes really hard for supporters. You feel like they fall for it every time, that a player loves them and then moves on."

Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand posted on X: "I can't believe Liverpool fans booing one of their own.

"I understand that some of you guys are not happy with his decision etc BUT to boo Trent after he has won the lot with you is baffling! Didn't cost you a penny."

Jason: I am sorry. You can't sing You'll Never Walk Alone every week and then boo your own player. That's not how it works. As a Liverpool fan, Trent will forever be the incredible talent that directly helped us win so many trophies. Trent YNWA.

Matt: The thing that bothers me is, would match going fans still boo if Trent left with a big transfer fee? We weren't happy with Coutinho when he left on a big transfer fee, we're not happy when Trent leaves on a free. Ultimately, for me, he's won everything, he's given everything, I'm disappointed he's moving on but fair play.

Rob: I am a loyal paying LFC fan and I and the vast majority of our LFC fan group think the booing was an embarrassment and a disgrace. If there is any blame it's on the club for not offering him a new contract last season. That will have put doubt in his mind about his future here so he would have needed to look at his options.

Tom: Here's an opinion from a paying Liverpool fan: to disregard the years of service Trent has given to this club, the soaring success he's been pivotal to and the wonderful memories he's given us fans and boo him in his final games is an utter disgrace. Fans bang on about loyalty this, loyalty that - the rank hypocrisy is galling.

Ben: I wouldn't boo Trent but he's deliberately ran his contract down and leaving Liverpool for free, so I can understand why some would.

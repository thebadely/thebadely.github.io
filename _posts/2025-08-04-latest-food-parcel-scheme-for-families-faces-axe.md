According to new developments, A food parcel scheme that provides groceries for vulnerable families during the school holidays is facing closure in a matter of weeks.

The Lunch Bags for Children initiative by The Bourne Parish in Farnham, Surrey, has fed around 100 children each holiday for the past three years. 

Previously backed by the local council and various charities, its future now hangs in the balance due to cuts in funding. 

Sandy Clarke, vicar of The Bourne and Tilford, said the need for the service is growing and it would be "heartbreaking" were it to stop now.

"Leafy Surrey is not the place where you expect to encounter poverty," she said.

"But in our parish we have a hall located in an area of relative deprivation, where almost 50% of the pupils at the local school receive free meals.

"So, just over four years ago, we started doing a community fridge and warehouse to address that need on a weekly basis, but school holidays make significantly further demands on families."

She added that, since 2022, they have also been giving those in need a week's worth of groceries to make "simple, healthy lunches" for their children. 

"Each time we do this it costs £1,000," said Rev Clarke.

"And, while there are some wonderful charities in Farnham, they've only got so much to give.   

"Ideally, it would be great to know we can carry on until next Easter, but that's only going to work if people donate."

She said that parishioner William Spencer and his chorister son George are among those trying to help.

The pair are being sponsored to cycle all the way to Venice in Italy this month and  have raised £1.2k so far.

"We just want to keep families together and children having nutritious meals," Rev Clarke added.    

"Ultimately, my biggest hope is for projects like this to be unnecessary.

"But, in the meantime, we just want to continue serving this community."

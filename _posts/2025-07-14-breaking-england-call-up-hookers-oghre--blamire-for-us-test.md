Let's dive into the details: Oghre and Blamire will meet up with the England squad in Washington DC today

United States v England

Date: Saturday 19 July Kick-off: 20:00 Venue: Audi Field, Washington DC

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app

Bristol's Gabriel Oghre and Leicester's Jamie Blamire will link up with England to solve a hooker shortage before Saturday's Test against the United States.

Jamie George, co-captain for the summer tour, has been called up to the British and Irish Lions tour, while Theo Dan, who stepped into the starting line-up in place of George for the second Test win over Argentina, has sustained a knee injury.

With Northampton's Curtis Langdon left as the only fit hooker, head coach Steve Borthwick has called on reinforcements for the third and final fixture of the tour.

Oghre appeared in England A's win over an Australian second string in November, but is yet to win a cap.

Blamire, who moved to Leicester from Newcastle this summer, made the most recent of his seven England appearances in a World Cup warm-up match against Wales in August 2023.

Blamire's debut came in England's last meeting with the United States â a 43-29 win at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham in 2021.

The United States slipped to 16th in the world rankings on Monday after losing 31-20 at home to Spain.

The Eagles failed to qualify for the 2023 World Cup, having made all but one of the preceding nine. 

The US will host the 2031 tournament, with World Rugby keen to build support by staging Tests in key cities in the run-up.

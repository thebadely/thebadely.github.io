Arsenal will continue to assess centre-back William Saliba, who was forced off against Liverpool with an ankle problem but returned to training on Friday.

Christian Norgaard and Ben White have also resumed training after injury lay-offs, while recent signing Piero Hincapie could also be in the matchday squad but Bukayo Saka remains sidelined by a hamstring issue.

New Nottingham Forest head coach Ange Postecoglou will be without full-back Ola Aina, who will be missing for three months after injuring his hamstring playing for Nigeria. 

Oleksandr Zinchenko is ineligible to face his parent club but recent signings Nicolo Savona, Dilane Bakwa, John Victor and Cuiabano await their debuts.

Players out: Arsenal - Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka Nottingham Forest - Ola Aina, Nicolas Dominguez, Oleksandr Zinchenko

Doubts: Arsenal - Christian Norgaard, William Saliba, Ben White 

Key FPL notes:

Riccardo Calafiori (Â£5.7m) has taken six shots - four of them from within the penalty area - in the last two Gameweeks, ranking him among the Premier League's top outfielders in that time. Before last week's blank against Liverpool, the Italian defender had also delivered three attacking returns (one goal, two assists) from his first two appearances this season.

Morgan Gibbs-White's (Â£7.5m) six shots and four shots in the box are both more than any other Nottingham Forest midfielder in 2025-26.

Elliot Anderson (Â£5.5m) has taken 18 corners and indirect free-kicks and touched the ball 316 times so far this season; both tallies are the highest by any player across the Premier League.

How did your club's players do on international duty?

Bournemouth right-back Adam Smith injured his hamstring in the win at Tottenham and will be out for several weeks. Lewis Cook has returned to training following a knee injury but is not yet 100% fit, while Julian Araujo is back from suspension.

Brighton remain without long-term absentees Solly March and Adam Webster but Albion otherwise have a fully fit squad, head coach Fabian Hurzeler has confirmed. Mats Wieffer returns after missing the win against Manchester City because of a knee problem. 

Players out: Bournemouth - Enes Unal, Adam Smith Brighton - Solly March, Adam Webster

Doubts: Bournemouth - Lewis Cook

Key FPL notes:

No forward in the division has created more chances (six) than Evanilson (Â£7.0m) over the past two Gameweeks, and few players have taken more shots than the Brazilian's eight overall.

He may have only registered one assist from three matches so far, but David Brooks' (Â£5.0m) strong underlying stats suggest an uptick in output might be around the corner. From just 129 minutes of action across his last two matches alone, the Welshman has let loose seven shots and created three of his league-leading four total big chances.

Despite racking up the most touches in the penalty area (24) and most successful take-ons (11) of any Premier League player so far, Brighton midfielder Yankuba Minteh (Â£5.9m) is yet to register a goal or assist this season. It may only be a matter of time, though, as Minteh has created five chances and fired off four shots of his own from within the box.

Ismaila Sarr will miss Crystal Palace's next two league games with a hamstring injury though he may return against Liverpool on 27 September. Adam Wharton remains out but could make his comeback next weekend, while new signing Yeremy Pino is set for his debut following a move from Villarreal. 

Sunderland's deadline-day signings Brian Brobbey, Bertrand Traore and Lutsharel Geertruida could come into contention. 

Dan Ballard is still out with a groin issue but he is expected to be fit to face Aston Villa next weekend. Luke O'Nien, who dislocated his shoulder in last season's play-off final, could also return against Villa, with Dennis Cirkin, Leo Hjelde, Romaine Mundle and Aji Alese further away from comebacks.

Players out: Crystal Palace - Cheick Doucoure, Eddie Nketiah, Chadi Riad, Ismaila Sarr, Adam Wharton Sunderland -  Aji Alese, Dan Ballard, Dennis Cirkin, Leo Hjelde, Niall Huggins, Romaine Mundle, Luke O'Nien

Key FPL notes:

Oliver Glasner finds himself without the in-form Ismaila Sarr (Â£6.5m) this weekend, but the Crystal Palace boss will hope his striker Jean-Philippe Mateta (Â£7.5m) can get the job done against Sunderland to build on his decent record against newly-promoted sides. The French centre forward bagged two goals at home in such circumstances in Gameweek 4 last season, and has delivered six goals - four of them at Selhurst Park - in nine appearances against Premier League newcomers over his previous two league campaigns.

Daniel Munoz (Â£5.5m) is yet to blank in FPL this season, delivering two clean sheets and an assist in his three appearances to date.

Habib Diarra (Â£5.5m) had three shots in the box and four penalty box touches in Sunderland's last match against Brentford.

Everton boss David Moyes says Iliman Ndiaye is nursing a "knock" and is unsure if the Senegal international will be available. 

The Toffees will also give a late fitness test to left-back Vitalii Mykolenko, who had to withdraw from international duty with Ukraine through injury. Jarrad Branthwaite remains sidelined but Nathan Patterson and Adam Aznou are both nearing returns.

Aston Villa boss Unai Emery says goalkeeper Emi Martinez is available despite missing the defeat by Crystal Palace amidst speculation over a possible move to Manchester United. 

Harvey Elliott is set for his debut after joining on loan from Liverpool, while fellow new arrivals Jadon Sancho and Victor Lindelof are also in contention, though both lack match fitness.

Players out: Everton - Jarrad Branthwaite Aston Villa  - Ross Barkley, Andres Garcia, Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana

Doubts: Everton - Adam Aznou, Vitalii Mykolenko, Iliman Ndiaye, Nathan Patterson 

Key FPL notes:

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Â£5.0m) has created seven chances, three of them 'big chances' (a joint league-high mark) in the last two Gameweeks.

New Toffees team-mate Jack Grealish (Â£6.7m) is also bossing the creativity stats with two big chances created, five key passes and a league-high four assists since he entered Everton's starting line-up in Gameweek 2.

Aston Villa remain the only team in the English football pyramid who are yet to score this season, with manager Unai Emery left thinking that will surely change soon. Ollie Watkins (Â£8.9m) - who has taken seven shots from inside the box in the last two Gameweeks - boasts four goals and three assists from his most recent six Premier League appearances against Everton.

Fulham boss Marco Silva has a fully fit squad to choose from and could hand a debut to Brazilian winger Kevin, who was signed from Shakhtar Donetsk on deadline day for a club-record fee of Â£34.6m.

Lucas Perri will miss Leeds' next two games with a muscle problem so Karl Darlow is expected to deputise in goal. 

A late decision will be made on the fitness of Ethan Ampadu and Ao Tanaka, both of whom are back in training following injuries, while Lukas Nmecha and Joel Piroe are also doubts. Joe Rodon is fit despite withdrawing from international duty with Wales.

Players out:  Leeds - Lucas Perri

Doubts: Leeds - Ethan Ampadu, Lukas Nmecha, Joel Piroe, Ao Tanaka

Key FPL notes:

Academy product Josh King (Â£4.5m) has been a bright spark for Fulham during their winless start to the season. The 18-year-old has started all three games for the Cottagers so far, landing three shots on target and creating two chances.

Fulham's current top creator is Sasa Lukic (Â£5.0m), who has crafted seven chances. The Serbian defensive midfielder has taken 13 corners and delivered four crosses from free-kicks, giving him a combined tally of set-piece deliveries that only Forest's Elliot Anderson can better so far.

Leeds' new arrival Anton Stach (Â£5.0m) has taken direct and indirect free-kicks as well as the majority of his team's corners so far this season, responsibilities which have helped the German midfielder create 10 chances - a tally only one player in the division can beat. Stach is also the Whites' top performer for shots (seven).

Newcastle's deadline-day signing Yoane Wissa is ruled out after injuring his knee playing for DR Congo and may need to consult with a specialist, head coach Eddie Howe says.

Another new arrival, Jacob Ramsey, will be absent for a month because of an ankle issue, while Anthony Gordon remains suspended. But Joelinton has returned to fitness and club-record buy Nick Woltemade could make his debut.

Wolves are again without key striker Jorgen Strand Larsen, with boss Vitor Pereira admitting the Norwegian's Achilles problem is more serious than first thought.

Ki-Jana Hoever is back in training after missing the defeat by Everton with a knee injury, while recent signings Tolu Arokodare and Ladislav Krejci could make their debuts.

Players out: Newcastle - Anthony Gordon, Jacob Ramsey, Yoane Wissa Wolves - Jorgen Strand Larsen

Key FPL notes:

Fabian Schar (Â£5.5m) could be a surprise hero for Newcastle in Gameweek 4. The Swiss centre back has a goal and three assists from eight appearances against Wolves, with three of those returns coming in his last three matches.

Jorgen Stand Larsen (Â£6.4m) - who was involved in his team's only goal against this opponent last season - has racked up five shots in the box in just 158 minutes of football this season.

Rodrigo Gomes (Â£4.5m) has found the net twice in his last two appearances (Gameweek 3 and Wolves' Carabao Cup win over West Ham).

West Ham will monitor Germany striker Niclas Fullkrug, who returned from international duty nursing a slight calf issue. Luis Guilherme remains out but fellow Brazilian Igor Julio is available for his debut after joining on loan from Brighton. 

Tottenham have no new injury concerns, with this game coming too soon for Dominic Solanke, though head coach Thomas Frank says the striker is "not too far away" from a return.

Players out: West Ham - Luis Guilherme Tottenham - Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Dominic Solanke, Kota Takai

Doubts: West Ham -  Niclas Fullkrug 

Key FPL notes:

James Ward-Prowse (Â£5.9m) has quietly created a team-high seven chances over the last two Gameweeks.

Mohammed Kudus (Â£6.6m) has attempted more take-ons (21) than any other Premier League player so far this season, succeeding on nine occasions. The Ghanaian - who scored and then was sent off against Tottenham whilst playing for the Hammers last season - has only managed to take two shots but has also created seven chances for Spurs and leads his team in the latter metric.

Guglielmo Vicario (Â£5.0m) has made more saves (13) than any other goalkeeper in the league to date, and only three peers - Arsenal's David Raya (Â£5.5m), Chelsea's Robert Sanchez (Â£5.0m) and Palace's Dean Henderson (Â£5.0m) - can match the Spurs shot-stopper's current record of two clean sheets and one goal conceded.

Vitaly Janelt is back in contention for Brentford after recovering from a heel problem that has sidelined him since April. Michael Kayode is also available despite suffering from illness whilst away with Italy's under-21s. Reiss Nelson could make his debut for the Bees after joining on loan from Arsenal on deadline day. 

Cole Palmer, who has missed Chelsea's last two games with a groin issue, returned to training on Thursday but did not complete the session, leaving his availability in doubt.

Alejandro Garnacho is not fully match fit following his move from Manchester United, according to head coach Enzo Maresca, but the Argentine might feature from the bench. Dario Essugo and Liam Delap could both be sidelined until December because of hamstring injuries.

Joao Pedro, Estevao, Andrey Santos and Moises Caicedo will need to be assessed following their return from World Cup qualifiers in South America.

Players out: Brentford - Yunus Konak, Paris Maghoma, Gustavo Nunes Chelsea - Levi Colwill, Liam Delap, Dario Essugo, Mykhailo Mudryk

Doubts: Chelsea - Cole Palmer, Joao Pedro, Estevao, Andrey Santos, Moises Caicedo

Key FPL notes:

Two big chances and three shots on target from three attempts since his Gameweek 2 debut marks a promising start to life at Brentford for Dango Ouattara (Â£6.0m). Last time out, the Bees' record signing was a close offside call away from registering two goals in as many appearances as well, and this weekend he'll be aiming to help his team record a first-ever Premier League home win over Chelsea.

Joao Pedro (Â£7.7m) and Enzo Fernandez (Â£6.6m) each have two goals and two assists from their first three appearances, making the Blues duo - alongside Everton's Grealish - the joint leaders for direct Premier League goal involvements so far this season.

In Gameweek 3 against Fulham, Moises Caicedo (Â£5.5m) accrued the most defensive contributions by a player in a single match this season, making 23 combined clearances, blocks, interceptions, recoveries and tackles.

Burnley boss Scott Parker has reported no new injury concerns. Hjalmar Ekdal was forced off playing for Sweden on Monday but has been passed fit.

Alexander Isak is set for his Liverpool debut following his British record Â£125m move from Newcastle, though head coach Arne Slot says the Reds will have to gradually build up his fitness.

Curtis Jones is ruled out after being injured against Arsenal but Jeremie Frimpong has resumed training following a hamstring problem and could come back into contention.

Players out: Burnley - Zeki Amdouni, Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts Liverpool - Curtis Jones

Doubts: Liverpool - Jeremie Frimpong

Key FPL notes:

Jaidon Anthony (Â£5.5m) is a threat Liverpool will have to look out for this weekend, with the English winger having bagged two goals and an assist from his last two Premier League outings. In that time, the Burnley man has enjoyed a joint league-high three big chances.

With his expected goal-busting (0.03 xG) howitzer to beat Arsenal in Gameweek 3, Dominik Szoboszlai (Â£6.5m) became the Premier League's first scorer of a direct free-kick this season, after the first 18 attempts across the division failed to find the back of the net.

Perennial record-breaker Mohamed Salah (Â£14.5m) has scored just a single goal - back in the 2017/18 season - in 10 appearances against Burnley.

Manchester City forward Omar Marmoush injured his knee playing for Egypt and will be absent for several weeks. John Stones is doubtful because of a minor muscle issue that ruled him out of England duty, while Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki remain sidelined.

Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is available for his debut following his Â£26m move from Paris St-Germain.

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim says Altay Bayindir will keep his starting spot despite the signing of fellow goalkeeper Senne Lammens on deadline day. Amorim also confirmed that Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot will miss Sunday's derby through injury.

Players out: Man City - Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki, Omar Marmoush, Man Utd - Matheus Cunha, Lisandro Martinez, Mason Mount, Diogo Dalot

Doubts: Man City - John Stones

Key FPL notes:

No player in the Premier League has had more shots in the box (13), big chances (six) or shots on target (five) than Erling Haaland (Â£14.1m), who is also the division's leading goal-scorer (three) after the first three Gameweeks. Against his next opponents, the Norwegian - fresh from scoring six times in two matches during the recent international break - has netted six times, and delivered three assists, in just five league appearances.

Joshua Zirkzee (Â£5.9m) managed a joint league-high nine penalty area touches, seven attempts and six shots from within the box against Burnley in Gameweek 3.

The 12 chances created by Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes (Â£9.0m) is the most of any Premier League player so far this season.

St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportscene: "First and foremost, you try to progress to the knock-out stages and try to get a home tie - and we've done that.

"Of course, you can get an easier tie than Hearts - they are spending millions of pounds and it's a huge football club with expectations - but we fancy anybody here."

As for Ayr's trip to Firhill, manager Scott Brown added: "We can't get away from Partick Thistle. We might as well play them again.

"We would have loved a home draw, but we have come away to a top-six side and competed and, especially in the second half, we were miles better than them."

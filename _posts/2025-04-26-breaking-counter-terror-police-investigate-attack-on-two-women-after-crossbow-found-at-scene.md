Let's dive into the details: A man has been arrested and counter-terrorism police are investigating after two women were seriously injured in an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm in Leeds.

Three people were found injured and taken to hospital - including the suspected attacker - in Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at 14:47 BST.

A 38-year-old man who suffered a "self-inflicted injury" was arrested and two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene.

Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had taken over the investigation from West Yorkshire Police and an extensive cordon remained in place in the Otley Road area.

Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said: "From the enquiries undertaken so far, there is no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved in the attack, and, at this time, we are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident."

A spokesperson said extensive inquiries were continuing to establish "the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation".

Assistant Chief Constable Carl Galvin said: "Clearly this has been a shocking incident and we fully realise the concern it has caused.

"Due to the enquiry being active we are limited in what we can say, but I do want to reassure residents that everything possible is being done to investigate and understand what took place."

He said uniformed officers were in the Otley Road area "to reassure residents and continue our enquiries at the crime scenes".

"I also want to thank members of the public for the support they gave victims and the emergency services as we attended the scene.

"We would strongly urge people not to speculate online or share information or footage which could affect the active investigation and continue to work closely with colleagues from Counter Terrorism Policing North East."

The incident happened on the Otley Run, which is a popular pub crawl route in Leeds.

Those participating in the run could be seen in fancy dress outside venues on Otley Road, close to where the incident happened.

Taylor's Sports Bar & Grill, a venue which is part of the pub crawl, announced on social media it would be closed until further notice.

A statement on its Facebook page said the closure was "due to unforeseen circumstances", before apologising to customers.

Joanna Myers, owner of the Swine Bistro on Otley Road said: "It was all very shocking, especially with all the Otley runners out.

"It could have been a lot worse than it was."

Ali Khan, owner of Indian restaurant The Cat's Pyjamas, which is on Otley Road, said people were "afraid and concerned" following the incident.

"We didn't find it safe to go out anywhere unless we knew what was going on," he said.

"I told all my staff members to stay inside and stay safe and vigilant."

Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Leeds West and Pudsey Rachel Reeves said it was "shocking" and asked anyone with information to contact the police.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said her thoughts were with the victims of the incident.

She said she was being updated on the situation and thanked police and emergency services for "their swift response".

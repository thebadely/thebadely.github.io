It has been recently reported that Europe beat the USA in Rome in 2023

The 2027 Ryder Cup at Adare Manor will be held from 17-19 September, it has been confirmed. 

Ryder Cup Europe announced that four "build-up days" will take place between 13 and 16 September before the matches begin on Friday, 17 September.

It will be the second time Ireland has hosted the biennial contest after Europe's victory over the USA at the K Club in County Kildare in 2006. 

Adare Manor, in County Limerick, was confirmed as the host venue in 2019. It previously hosted the Irish Open in 2007 and 2008 before undergoing an extensive renovation in 2017.

The 2027 event will be the 46th edition of the Ryder Cup and will mark its 100th anniversary.

"Rory McIlroy's victory in the Masters last month to complete the career Grand Slam, combined with anticipation of July's Open Championship (at Royal Portrush), has already heightened the buzz around golf on the island of Ireland," said DP World Tour (formerly the European Tour) chief executive Guy Kinnings. 

"This announcement will add to that excitement as Ireland continues its preparation to host golf's greatest team competition for the second time in 2027 when the Ryder Cup celebrates its 100th anniversary."

Patrick O'Donovan, Irish Minister for Arts, Culture, Communications, Media and Sport, said: "The passion of Irish people for golf makes Ireland really stand out internationally as a golfing venue. 

"For Ryder Cup week, the eyes of the sporting world will be on the beautiful village of Adare and I am confident that the local community and the people of Limerick and Ireland generally will ensure this event is a wonderful success and that all who attend will want to return to visit Ireland again."

This year's Ryder Cup takes place at Bethpage Black in New York from 26-28 September.

Europe will again be led by Luke Donald after the Englishman orchestrated a 16Â½-11Â½ victory in Rome in 2023. The USA will be captained by Keegan Bradley.

The captains for the 2027 event have not yet been confirmed.

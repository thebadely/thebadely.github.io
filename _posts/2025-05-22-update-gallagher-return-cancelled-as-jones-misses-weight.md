Tysie Gallagher's Commonwealth and British title fight against Ebonie Jones on Friday is off after the challenger failed to make weight.

Gallagher, 26, was due to make her return to action three months after her mother-in-law was killed and the original fight with Jones was postponed as a result.

Jones beat Gallagher twice in the amateurs and Friday's fight was scheduled for the undercard of Terri Harper's world title defence at Doncaster's Eco-Power Stadium.

"We got a call late last night saying the fight is off due to Ebonie not making weight," Gallagher said on Instagram.

"As professional athletes we have a job to make weight. Unfortunately Ebonie couldn't stick to her end of the bargain. 

"Absolutely gutted. Even if it's not a title fight, any fight, I think it's disgraceful if a fighter can't make weight."

"I am just devastated," she added. "I put everything into this camp."

The bout is not expected to be rescheduled as a catchweight nor is a new opponent possible for Gallagher at this late stage.

Gallagher pulled out of her fight with Jones on 7 February when her mother-in-law was killed following what the police described as an "altercation" at her home. 

A 25-year-old man has since been charged with murder and grievous bodily harm. 

Gallagher and Jones have a long history together having fought twice in the amateurs.

Jones, 27, won both those bouts and Gallagher was hoping to avenge that defeat while retaining her titles.

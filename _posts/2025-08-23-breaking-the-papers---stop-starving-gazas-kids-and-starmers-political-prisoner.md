Experts revealed that The Mirror's front page carries a photo of three-year-old Karim Muammer who is in hospital in southern Gaza with malnutrition. The paper has published an open letter from 12 Holocaust survivors who say they are begging Israel to end the horror of starving Palestinian children after famine was confirmed in Gaza by a body backed by the United Nations. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,  dismissed its report as an "outright lie". But one of the signatories to the letter, Joan Salter, says the situation is a human tragedy and it breaks her heart that Israel is a part of it.

Nigel Farage's plan to deal with asylum seekers should he become prime minister is the lead in the Times. The Reform UK leader tells the paper that detaining and deporting all migrants who arrive illegally is "the only way forward". As well as five charter flights leaving each day to facilitate the deportations, Farage says his party would introduce criminal offences for those who tried to return to the UK or who tear up their identity documents.

The Sun and the Telegraph both carry a photo on their front pages of Lucy Connolly after her release from prison on Thursday. She pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred online following the Southport stabbings last year - calling for people to set fire to hotels housing asylum seekers. In an interview with the Telegraph she said the incident was not her "finest moment" but she still finds it "bizarre" that her actions put her in jail. She tells the paper she was definitely a "political prisoner".

Writing in the Mail, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch says Labour-run councils which are encouraging the removal of the flag of St George from town halls or lamp-posts are "fuelling racial division". In her article, she says that it should not be controversial to say that we are proud of our flag and that the denigration of anything British in the name of diversity is not "progressive".

The Telegraph lifts the lid on a group of what it calls "pasta grannies" in Italy who have gone on strike after they were targeted by police raids. Known for making orrechiette or "little ear" pasta by hand outside their homes in Bari - in the southern region of Puglia - the paper says police are investigating allegations that some of them have been buying the pasta in, and passing it off as homemade.

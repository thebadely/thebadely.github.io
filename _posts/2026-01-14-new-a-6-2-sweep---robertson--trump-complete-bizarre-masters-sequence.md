Let's dive into the details: Neil Robertson and Judd Trump are both two-time winners of the Masters

Neil Robertson completed an unprecedented eighth 6-2 win in the first round of the Masters as he advanced past Chris Wakelin into the quarter-finals.

Wu Yize started the sequence when he defeated defending champion Shaun Murphy on Sunday at Alexandra Palace.

World number one Judd Trump progressed past Ding Junhui on Wednesday afternoon for the first round's seventh consecutive 6-2 scoreline - at odds of 44,000-1.

But there was more to come, with Robertson completing a 6-2 clean sweep in the evening - and the odds of all eight opening-round matches finishing that way were 220,000-1.

Remarkably, the odds of predicting the scores and also correctly naming all eight winners amounted to 20,000,000-1.

No more than four first-round contests had previously ended 6-2 at any Masters tournament, but when two-time winner Robertson made superb back-to-back century breaks after the interval to establish a 4-2 advantage, a clean sweep appeared inevitable.

Wakelin, making only his second appearance at the Masters, as a last-minute replacement for record eight-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, was unable to arrest the trend.

"I wasn't even thinking about winning the match - I was thinking just win it 6-2," joked Robertson on BBC Four. 

"I didn't know if someone in the audience had maybe had a pound on all the matches being the same scoreline or something. It is amazing. I hope I have made someone a multi-millionaire. I have never seen anything like that before."

Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry, added: "It is phenomenal. You would normally at least three 6-5 scores because of the nature of the tournament. 

"It has been incredible. After the interval players have really stepped up."

Ken Doherty, who won the 1997 world title, echoed those comments, adding: "I have never seen anything like this in snooker."

Australia's Robertson, who knocked in superb breaks of 116, 135 and 102, will now face Kyren Wilson in the last on Friday (19:00 GMT).

Trump seals 6-2 victory against Ding

In truth, Trump's margin of victory over Ding was hardly surprising given he swept past the same player by the same score at the UK Championship in December.

It was also Trump's fifth consecutive success against China's Ding, who won this title in 2011.

And he did it in style, constructing three century breaks along the way.

The Englishman crafted breaks of 116 and 69 as he raced into a 3-0 lead before Ding responded with runs of 98 and 53 to reduce his arrears to a solitary frame.

However, Trump regained a two-frame cushion with a run of 88 and then compiled a wonderful 117 and 109 to confirm a meeting with Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the last eight on Thursday at 19:00 GMT.

"I feel confident and have got to a few finals recently and it has taken some good players to stop me," Trump told BBC Sport.

"I am full of confidence and hopefully I can go one better this tournament. I have had a month off tournaments but still been putting the work in."

"I convinced myself my game would not be 6-2 and at 3-0 up I thought, 'at least I can't lose 6-2'," said Trump.

"It's incredible really because all the players are so closely matched and to have every single game go that way is so surprising."

Ding, who did not pot another ball after getting back to 3-2, admired Trump's ruthlessness and felt his own play made it all too easy for his opponent.

"I played a few terrible safety shots and let him win and have chances easier," Ding said.

"He was playing good and I wasn't at a good enough level to play against him. His standard is very high. He didn't miss much and it is very difficult to play him."

Let's dive into the details: An 18-year-old man has been charged with murder after a student was fatally stabbed near a university campus.

De Montfort University (DMU) student Khaleed Oladipo, 20, died in hospital on Tuesday evening after he was stabbed in Oxford Street, Leicester.

Harper Dennis, of North Road, West Drayton in London, has been charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, Leicestershire Police confirmed.

The force said Dennis was due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Saturday.

A tribute released by the family of Oladipo, from London, said he was in his second year at DMU and had been studying cyber-security.

They described him as "a good boy who loved his family" and thanked the members of the public who stopped to try and help him after he was stabbed.

Oladipo's family said one of his main passions was football and believed he was on his way home to watch Arsenal, the team he supported, when he was stabbed.

According to police, a post-mortem examination showed he died as a result of a stab wound to the chest.

The force said it was called to Oxford Street, close to the junction with Bonners Lane, just after 17:00 GMT on Tuesday, and several nearby roads were subsequently closed.

Prof Katie Normington, vice-chancellor of DMU, said she was "devastated" over Oladipo's death, adding direct support was being offered to students, staff and his family.

Police said Dennis had also been charged with two counts of possession of an offensive weapon in a private place, which were unrelated to the murder investigation.

Watch: Rory McIlroy says Oakmont is 'probably' toughest US Open course

Rory McIlroy says his recent loss of form has helped him realise he needs to "get my stuff together" at this week's US Open after struggling for motivation following his career-defining Masters win. 

Northern Ireland's superstar golfer became just the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam with his Masters victory in April, but he has since struggled, finishing tied 47th at last month's US PGA Championship before missing the cut by 12 shots at last week's Canadian Open.

While the 36-year-old said it was important for him to savour his Augusta triumph, he added he wants to move on at Oakmont Country Club as he bids for a second US Open title.

"I think it's trying to have a little bit of amnesia and forget about what happened six weeks ago [at the Masters], then just trying to find the motivation to go back out there and work as hard as I've been working," said 2011 US Open champion McIlroy.

"I worked incredibly hard on my game from October last year all the way up until April this year.

"It was nice to sort of see the fruits of my labour come to fruition and have everything happen."

'This course challenges your sanity' - why Oakmont is toughest US Open test

McIlroy, who has reverted to his old driver after struggling off the tee in Canada, added: "You have to enjoy that. You have to enjoy what you've just accomplished. 

"I certainly feel like I'm still doing that and I will continue to do that. At some point you have to realise that there's a little bit more golf left to play this season. 

"Weeks like Quail Hollow [at the US PGA] or even weeks like last week, it makes it easier to reset in some way - to be like 'OK, I sort of need to get my stuff together here and get back to the process'."

McIlroy also explained that he has "always been a player that struggles" to perform immediately after a big win.

"I always struggle to show up with motivation the next week because you've just accomplished something and you want to enjoy it, and you want to sort of relish the fact that you've achieved a goal," he said.

McIlroy added he "certainly can't relax" this week at Oakmont, where he missed the cut when the challenging Pittsburgh layout last staged the US Open in 2016.

He also failed to make the weekend in 2017 and 2018, but has since posted six consecutive top-10 finishes and has been runner-up the past two years. 

"I made the decision at that back end of 2018 into 2019, I wanted to try to build my game around the toughest tests that we have in the game," he said. 

"The US Open went from probably my least favourite major to probably my favourite because of what it asks from you, and I love that challenge."

While McIlroy said he tried to wipe 2016 from his memory, he was handed a stark reminder of Oakmont's severe demands - five-inch rough and undulating greens - when he shot an 11-over 81 during an early practice round last week. 

"Last Monday felt impossible - I birdied the last two holes for 81," said the five-time major winner, adding the course feels "softer" this week.

"It felt pretty good, it didn't feel like I played that bad! It's much more benign now. 

"They had the pins in dicey positions and the greens were running at 15 and a half. It was nearly impossible."

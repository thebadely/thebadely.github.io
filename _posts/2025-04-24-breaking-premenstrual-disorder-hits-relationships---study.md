Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) takes a "significant" toll on daily life and relationships, a study has found.

PMDD, which is a severe cyclical, hormone-based mood disorder linked to periods, is thought to affect more than one in 20 women.

Research led by Durham University studied 400 people and found those with the disorder reported lower quality of life and relationships.

Lead author Dr Sophie Hodgetts said the study "clearly highlights the need for greater clinical recognition of the interpersonal impact of PMDD".

PMDD sufferers, which accounted for over 50% of respondents (216), expressed a lower sense of intimacy, trust and passion within their relationships.

Researchers also found partners expressed feelings of high stress, a diminished sense of personal growth and worth, difficulties or inabilities within their caregiving roles, and a general sense of feeling unsupported.

They also reported similar levels of dissatisfaction within their relationships.

However, both sufferers and partners agreed "love" and "commitment" remained unaffected, with strong and consistent responses in these areas from people living with the condition and their companions.

Dr Hodgetts added: "It is particularly striking that the patterns of difficulty reported were so similar for both PMDD sufferers and their partners," she said.

The study was conducted with the support of the International Association for Premenstrual Disorders.

Additionally, the collaboration is exploring the lived experiences of undergoing treatment for PMDD and investigating the intersection of PMDD and neurodivergence.

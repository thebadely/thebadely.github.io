Let's dive into the details: England play the Netherlands in Zurich

England manager Sarina Wiegman said she had "no regrets" with her starting 4-2-3-1 formation in Saturday's 2-1 defeat against France in their Euro 2025 opener.

She has some big decisions to make as the Lionesses return to action against the Netherlands on Wednesday (17:00 BST), when they will need a much-improved performance to make their mark on Group D.

"I don't know yet," Wiegman said when asked if she will change formation against her former side.

"I make a lot of considerations before I make a starting line-up. Sometimes things go well, sometimes it doesn't go well - but I don't have regrets. We try to turn every stone before we make the line-up."

Who should start for the Lionesses in what Beth Mead and Grace Clinton described as a "must-win" game on Wednesday? 

BBC Sport picks out some of the key decisions facing Wiegman - and you can choose the XI you want to start in Zurich below.

'A bit of a lesson for England - but a good one' - Izzy Christiansen

England were overloaded in midfield with Georgia Stanway and Keira Walsh unable to contain wave after wave of France attacks.

Grace Clinton's introduction in the 77th minute, replacing Stanway, gave the Lionesses a different look in the middle of the park with the Manchester United midfielder providing some much-needed energy.

Lauren James started for England against France, as she continues her return from a hamstring injury sustained in April, and she played in the number 10 role before going off on the hour mark.

However, her free role sometimes left England exposed in midfield and they looked more secure when Ella Toone replaced her.

"If I was picking the team I definitely would have had Clinton in from the start," former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"We know the talent of Lauren James but I'd have had it the other way. Start Clinton, bring James on to make an impact."

Another position to consider is left-back, where Jess Carter was exposed numerous times by France's attackers before Niamh Charles replaced her for the final 30 minutes.

Charles could provide a better option to deal with the pace of Netherlands forward Lineth Beerensteyn as well as captain Vivianne Miedema, both key attacking threats.

Captain Leah Williamson said there are "different places available and different opposition", but should Wiegman stick or twist?

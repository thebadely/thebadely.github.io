Let's dive into the details: A uniform swap proved so popular it had to move into a larger venue, organisers said. 

The Great Big Hornsea Uniform Swap was held on Saturday at East Riding Leisure Hornsea. 

The event provided an opportunity for parents and carers to pick up primary and secondary school uniforms for free.

Parent Claire Potter described the event as "invaluable".

Natalie Wilson, a teaching assistant at Hornsea Community School, organised the event and said uniform left in lost property was often unnamed so could not be returned to its owner.

"I'd rather it was getting reused because a lot of it's got a lot of life left in it," she said. 

In 2024, the event was held in the parish hall, but this year they needed a bigger venue as there was so much uniform to swap. 

Unclaimed uniforms were collected from Hornsea Burton Primary School and Hornsea School and Language College.  

Parents also donated uniform that their children had grown out of.

"We've made it a big thing that it is about saving the environment rather than a financial thing," Ms Wilson said.

The average cost of a school uniform is just over £340 for primary school children and about £454 for those in secondary education, according to government figures.  

However, the pre-loved uniforms at the event in Hornsea were all free.

"To recycle is far better for the planet," Ms Potter said. 

"It helps people with the cost of living."

Sarah Hyde, a mother of three children, said: "What will happen to all this uniform otherwise? 

"It would all go into landfill, so it's amazing. It gives the clothes a second life."

Parent Emma Watts said: "I'm in between jobs so it's going to help me out until I get my first pay. 

"The school jumpers are £35 each, and you get them here for free, so it's worth coming down.

"It's great, it's well organised and I'm surprised how many people are here."

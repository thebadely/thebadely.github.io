Scorecard

Gujarat Titans beat Mumbai Indians - and the rain - to snatch a remarkable final-ball victory and go top of the Indian Premier League.

A see-saw match looked to have gone the way of Mumbai when a second rain delay stopped Gujarat's chase with another 24 runs needed from 12 balls - the visitors behind on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method.

But the rain stopped and Gujarat's target was adjusted to 147, leaving them 15 to get from the final six balls as the match resumed moments before the cut-off at 00:30 local time.

Rahul Tewatia hit the first ball for four and two balls later Gerald Coetzee slammed a straight six to leave four to get from three balls.

Bowler Deepak Chahar then overstepped to gift the Titans another run, only for Coetzee to be caught off the penultimate ball with the scores level.

New batter Arshad Khan scrambled the one run needed from the last ball for the Titans, although Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya still could have forced a super over but missed with his throw from mid-on when a direct hit would have run out Arshad.

The Titans won by three runs via the DLS method.

"It is quite remarkable," former England bowler Steven Finn said on BBC Radio 5 Live commentary.

"One over, 15 needed, Coetzee hammers it for six and the tables turned immediately. This game really did have everything apart from a super over."

Titans captain Shubman Gill said: "There were a lot of emotions, most of them frustrating because at one point we were ahead of the game and it felt like one of those Test match sessions that don't go your way.

"Everything worked out well for us.

"Even after this with so much chaos, wins like these are what get you through in a big tournament."

That all came after the visitors were cruising at 107-2 in pursuit of 156 until the first rain delay, after which they lost 4-25 in four overs amid an electric spell of fast bowling from Mumbai's quicks.

Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets, Trent Boult one and Ashwani Kumar the other - all of which was in vain for Mumbai who also would have topped the table with a win.

Former England captain Jos Buttler scored 30 for the Titans before the rain with a partner of 72 with Gill helped by an 11-ball over from Hardik that included two no-balls and three separate wides.

"My no-balls, and the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20 it is a crime," said Hardik. "It bites you.

"The ball kept getting wetter - I don't know if it helped us or not. It was difficult."

Also wasted by Mumbai was 53 from 35 balls by England all-rounder Will Jacks in Mumbai's 155-8.

Jacks, whose fifty was his first for the franchise, put on 73 with Suryakumar Yadav but Mumbai lost 6-58 after Suryakumar was dismissed for 35.

The Titans move level on points with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, but sit top of the table courtesy of their superior net run-rate. 

Mumbai stay in the play-off places in fourth but, having played a game more than those below them, have work to do to qualify for the play-offs.

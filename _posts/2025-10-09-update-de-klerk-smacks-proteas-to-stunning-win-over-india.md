Scorecard; Table

Nadine de Klerk hit a blistering unbeaten 84 from 54 balls as South Africa produced a stunning comeback to beat co-hosts India by three wickets at the Women's World Cup.

Having slipped to 81-5 in reply to India's 251 all out, the Proteas looked destined for a second defeat in three games before De Klerk's intervention.

The all-rounder dismantled an increasingly bewildered India attack, launching five sixes on her way to her highest international score - the fifth of those blows sealing the win with seven balls to spare.

Captain Laura Wolvaardt started the South Africa recovery, hitting a patient 70 from 111 balls, with her 61-run stand alongside Chloe Tryon laying the foundations for De Klerk's late onslaught.

Tryon, who made 49 from 66, put on another 69 with De Klerk in quick time before the latter saw the job through to leave India fans and players alike wondering how the game had got away from them.

For much of the second innings, it was India who would have expected to be talking about battling back to claim victory after wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh had bludgeoned 94 from 77 to rescue them from 102-6.

However, even her remarkable innings was not enough thanks to the clean hitting of De Klerk.

The result means South Africa go level on points with India, who miss the chance to go top of the table as Harmanpreet Kaur's side suffer their first defeat of the tournament.

Best shots from De Klerk's innings as she leads South Africa to victory

Six days ago in Guwahati, Proteas skipper Wolvaardt was facing up to the media after her side had been bowled out for 69 in a 10-wicket thrashing by England.

"We will put this behind us as quickly as we can," she said. But even she could not have expected what has followed.

They cruised to victory over New Zealand to get themselves back on track. One win, one loss after two games against their biggest competitors for a top-four place.

Australia and India were supposed to be a level above, so facing the co-hosts had the potential to scupper South Africa's momentum all over again.

Instead, they're flying with belief that a semi-final spot might only prove another step in a glorious comeback story.

De Klerk's innings of a lifetime, in which she cleared the ropes at will and left India's star-studded side reeling, will quite rightly take the headlines.

It is a knock that will have her front and centre of opposition plans before they play South Africa in future.

"That was incredible," Wolvaardt said. "I don't think I've seen something like that in all of my career.

"That innings that Nadine played was very special. I'm lost for words."

What made it so remarkable was not just the ball-striking but the composure and mental resilience.

That started with Wolvaardt and Tryon, who refused to give up on a match that seemed lost - with one dreadful batting collapse already in this tournament, it would have been easy to surrender to another.

Instead, they dug in and gave their side a chance. De Klerk and Tryon got them that much closer but even when the latter was dismissed, it could have turned into a familiar tale of a side valiant in defeat.

However, De Klerk held her nerve and saw it through. Forget chokers, this World Cup's comeback queens are proving themselves to be as resilient as they come.

Ghosh hits 94 off 77 balls to help India recover from batting collapse

After Australia had shown their strength in depth with match-winning centuries from Ash Gardner and Beth Mooney saving them from shock defeats already in this tournament, Wednesday in Visakhapatnam looked like being India's response.

Ghosh's brilliant counter-attacking knock looked like it  was going to turn something of a crisis situation at 102-6, after a collapse of 5-19, into a comfortable win.

Coming in at number eight, the 22-year-old accumulated steadily alongside Amanjot Kaur before exploding into life after that partnership was broken.

Ghosh was irresistible, hitting 58 from 33 balls after the fall of the seventh wicket, and showing herself to be a 360 player with boundaries all around the ground.

Any width was unceremoniously punished but anything too straight would travel, too - the margin for error for South Africa's bowlers was razor thin.

Ghosh might not have quite have been able to match Gardner and Mooney, as she narrowly missed out on a maiden international century, but the innings seemed certain to prove every bit as important.

For around 40 overs of the chase it was. Then De Klerk happened.

South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt: "We knew we were ahead of them the whole time. They had a big finish but we thought if we can take it as deep as we can, maybe we can have something special."

Player of the match, South Africa all-rounder Nadine de Klerk: "I am lost for words. It was good to finish the game off and try and dig deep. It has given us a lot of confidence going forward.

"I like being under pressure and I love World Cups as well."

India captain Harmanpreet Kaur: "We played really well. We collapsed when batting but we managed to score 250.

"It's a long tournament and it was a tough game for us. We have good games coming up and the important thing is that we keep going and improving."

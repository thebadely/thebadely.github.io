Let's dive into the details: Eben Etzebeth will be looking to add to his 140 South Africa caps from the bench in Cardiff

Autumn international: Wales v South Africa

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 29 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Listen on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru; live text commentary on BBC Sport website & app

South Africa have named seven forwards on their bench in a powerful squad to face Wales at Principality Stadium.

Rassie Erasmus is denied the services of several players for the autumn finale, which is outside World Rugby's official Test window, but still names a formidable side for Cardiff.

The Springboks' bench has more caps (374) than Wales' entire matchday squad (306).

The head coach makes eight personnel changes to the team that beat Ireland 24-13 in Dublin with captain and flanker Siya Kolisi, lock Ruan Nortje, number eight Jasper Wiese, fly-half Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, centre Damian de Allende, wing Canan Moodie and full-back Damian Willemse retained.

Hooker Johan Grobbelaar, props Wilco Louw and Gerhard Steenekamp, lock Jean Kleyn and Franco Mostert - at blind-side flanker rather than lock - come into a hefty pack.

Scrum-half Morne van den Berg, centre Andre Esterhuizen and wing Ethan Hooker get the nod in the backs with Erasmus going for power on a bench which includes legendary lock Eben Etzebeth along the seven replacement forwards.

South Africa start as overwhelming favourites to add to their victories against Japan, Italy, France and Ireland given their depth.

"We knew from the outset that we would lose players for this match due to their club commitments, and we are pleased with the quality of the team we've selected," said Erasmus.

"We've been rotating our players throughout the year, and this group has been together for close to five weeks, so many of these combinations are fully settled."

Scrum-half Cobus Reinach - the only back on the bench - is in line to win his 50th cap.

Erasmus even mentioned the possibility of fielding one of his coaches against Wales this weekend if they get a late injury crisis.

Former number eight Duane Vermeulen is among the last-resort options for the Test in Cardiff.

Vermeulen, 39, retired with 76 Test caps after the World Cup final in Paris two years ago.

"We kind of rolled the dice because we really only have 24 players with us," said Erasmus.

"Ntuthuko Mchunu is the 24th player, and Duane Vermeulen is currently the 25th if we get an injury before Saturday."

Thirteen of Wales' squad have returned to their English and French clubs, Steve Tandy's side having conceded half-centuries to both Argentina and New Zealand this autumn with his first-choice line-up.

"Both teams were in a similar situation with regards to the availability of players, but they have a balanced squad with a few seasoned players and several younger guys who will be desperate to make a statement," said Erasmus.

"So, we are expecting them to come out firing and to throw everything at us."

South Africa: D Willemse; Hooker, De Allende, Esterhuizen, Moodie; Feinberg-Mngomezulu, Van der Berg; Steenekamp, Grobbelaar, Louw, Kleyn, Nortje, Kolisi (capt), Mostert, Wiese.

Replacements: Mbonambi, Porthen, Ntlabakanye, Etzebeth, Van Staden, Dixon, Smith, Reinach.

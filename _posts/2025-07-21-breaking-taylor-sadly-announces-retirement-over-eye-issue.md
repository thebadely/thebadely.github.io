Let's dive into the details: Josh Taylor became one of Scotland's most successful boxers

Former undisputed world champion Josh Taylor says it is "sadly necessary" to announce his retirement from boxing on medical advice.

The 34-year-old Scot underwent eye surgery in February last year and, in the wake of his defeat by Ekow Essuman in May, has been advised by specialists that to continue boxing would put his eyesight at risk.

The Tartan Tornado is one of Scotland's greatest ever boxers, having won Commonwealth Games gold at Glasgow 2014 and embarked on an extraordinary run in the professional ranks that led to him becoming world champion in just his 15th fight, unified champion in his 16th and undisputed light-welterweight champion in only his 18th bout.

He was the first - and remains the only - male fighter from the UK to capture all four belts in a single division.

Taylor said in a statement: "Right folks, this isn't an easy post for me to write, but on the advice of my doctors, it's sadly a necessary one.

"As has been publicised before, I've had a recurring issue with my eye that unfortunately means I now have to call time on my career or risk losing my eyesight.

"While the fighter in me always wants to box on, I know I have to listen to the medical professionals and save me from myself.

"It is certainly not the way I wanted to bow out but I have to listen to the doctors and those around me.

"I am just a kid from the Pans who scaled the very top of the sport but I could not have done it without those who have supported me through thick and thin."

A talented amateur, Taylor represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games in London but it was two years later that he shot to prominence by winning the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games at the Hydro in Glasgow, bettering his silver at the 2010 Games in Delhi.

That venue would host some of Taylor's greatest nights, including his victory over Ivan Baranchyk in 2019 when he captured his first world title.

Later that year, the Scot edged a classic fight against American star Regis Prograis in London to unify the IBF and WBC light-welterweight titles.

That in turn set up a showdown with another US fighter, Jose Ramirez, in Las Vegas in May 2021 for all four belts. Taylor made history by flooring Ramirez twice en route to a points victory and became undisputed champion of the world.

A controversial points win over England's Jack Catterall in February 2022 sparked the downturn in Taylor's career, with injury and inactivity a blight on the past few years.

Having vacated three of his four belts amidst a host of injury problems, he lost the last of his world titles to American Teofimo Lopez in New York in 2023 and was beaten by Catterall in their rematch in Leeds last year.

Defeat by Essuman in Glasgow two months ago proved to be the final chapter in an extraordinary career few other fighters, particularly from the UK, have ever enjoyed.

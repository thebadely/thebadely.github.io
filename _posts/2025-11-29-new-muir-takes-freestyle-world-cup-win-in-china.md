Let's dive into the details: Kirsty Muir was the youngest British athlete to compete at the 2022 Winter Olympics

Scottish freestyle skier Kirsty Muir took gold at the Big Air World Cup at Secret Garden in China.

The 21-year-old from Aberdeen took a commanding lead from the first jump and beat Canada's Naomi Urness and home favourite Liu Mengting, who finished in third.

Muir's win is the first podium for a GB Snowsport athlete this season and the first Big Air World Cup victory of her career.

With finals rescheduled to Saturday morning because of approaching high winds, Muir took the lead with a perfectly executed left double-14 safety, backed up by a third round right double-10 mute for a final score of 174.50.

"I'm so stoked. I was in it today to get my tricks down," she said. 

"I wanted to just focus on the tricks, the result was just the end outcome.

"Overall I'm just so, so happy with how I skied, that's what I'm going to take away from this."

The win is Muir's second World Cup victory - having won slopestyle gold in Tignes last season - and a second podium since returning from knee and shoulder surgery which had kept her out of action for a year from the end of 2023.

Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson will go into the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics as medal contenders

Elsewhere on Saturday, figure skaters Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson won their eighth British senior ice dance title, surpassing the previous record of seven jointly held by Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, and John and Sinead Kerr.

Fear and Gibson, who won a historic World Championship bronze in March, scored 86.24 for their rhythm dance - soundtracked by a Spice Girls medley - and 124.86 for their free dance, amassing a total score of 211.10 in Sheffield.

"It's wild because Torvill and Dean are the British ice dance team, and just to have our names mentioned alongside theirs, let alone to have won it eight times, is crazy," said Fear, 26. 

"It means so much and it shows the history we have here, all the memories we've built and how we've grown over those eight years, so it's really cool to look back on." 

Fear and 31-year-old Gibson will skate again on British ice in January as the European Championships come to Sheffield, before the Winter Olympics get under way in Italy in February.

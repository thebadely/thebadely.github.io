It has been recently reported that Firefighters are tackling a large blaze at warehouse following a "serious" explosion.

Police, ambulance crews and firefighters were called to the Groundwell Industrial Estate on Crompton Road in Swindon at about 19:30 BST.

The building destroyed was being used by a printing business named ESP Smile, BBC reporters have confirmed by verifying video footage of the aftermath.

Wiltshire Police described the incident as "serious" and a large cordon is in place around the scene.

ESP Smile has been approached for comment.

A force spokesperson said they evacuated nearby buildings, and that people living nearby should stay indoors and keep their windows closed for their own safety.

Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service (DWFRS) said it has 10 fire engines at the scene, along with other specialist vehicles.

In an update at 21:40 BST, DWFRS said: "Firefighters are using a water tower from the aerial ladder platform and ground monitors to extinguish the fire. 

"A fire investigation officer is at the scene and an investigation into the cause will begin as soon as it is safe to do so.

"There is a smoke plume and local residents are asked to keep their windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."

Dozens of residents have written on social media that they felt their homes shake following the explosion. 

Jason O'Grady, head coach and owner of Swindon Martial Arts and Fitness, located about 200 metres (656ft) from the site, said staff running lessons earlier heard "a massive loud bang" and "bits of ceiling tile fell down on everybody".

Mr O'Grady, who was not at work at the time, said staff had initially thought the building had been hit by a car, and that a large crack had appeared along the top of the wall. 

"Luckily our guys were quite quick to get out so the police let them go, but I do know the place behind us, the police kept them in because they were a little bit worried about which factory had blown up and what kind of smoke was in the air, so they kept them in for a while before they evacuated them," he said.

Mr O'Grady said he has no idea what condition his business's building is in.

"I went to check and make sure everyone was out and do a safety check but the police wouldn't let anyone near it, which is obviously the right thing to do," he said.

"I don't think we are going to know anything until tomorrow."

Our reporter at the scene, Kelly Morgan, said people have been out of their houses gathering on the edge of pavements and checking their phones.

She said: "There's a general feeling of uncertainty and fear."

There is also a power cut in the area affecting 77 properties, according to Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN).

SSEN said on its website it needed to isolate power "due to a safety concern on our network".

"There is no concern for safety at your property, however, there is an isolated issue elsewhere our teams need to make safe before they can turn your power back on," the company said.

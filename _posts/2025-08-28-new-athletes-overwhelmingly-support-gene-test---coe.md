Let's dive into the details: The World Championships will run from 13-21 September in Tokyo, Japan

World Athletics president Lord Coe says athletes are "overwhelmingly supportive" of the gene test which is being introduced for those wanting to compete in the female category.

In March, the governing body approved the introduction of a one-time test for the SRY gene â which is part of the Y chromosome and causes male characteristics to develop â to be applied for world ranking competitions.

The test is only required to be taken once and can be conducted via a cheek swab or blood test. If the result shows negative for the Y chromosome, the athlete is eligible to compete in the female category.

The regulations come into effect on 1 September and will be in operation for the World Championships beginning in Tokyo on 13 September.

Coe estimates more than 90% of athletes competing in female category events in Japan will have been tested before arriving in the country with the remainder then tested in their pre-competition holding camps.

"The athletes are overwhelmingly supportive of this, and have been very, very helpful in all this," he said.

"The member federations have been very supportive and we needed to establish the most effective test, the test that was the most non-invasive, the one we could carry out.

"It wasn't without its challenges, but there will be athletes that will be tested even in their holding camps in Tokyo.

"We wanted athletes to get tested, where possible, before Tokyo, and that is a very, very important principle. But if, for whatever reason, that proves difficult, we do have the opportunity to do that when they are in Tokyo."

The test was one of several recommendations approved at March's World Athletics Council meeting to tighten regulations over the eligibility of transgender and difference of sex development (DSD) athletes.

In March 2023, World Athletics introduced a ban for transgender athletes who had gone through male puberty from competing in the female category in international competition.

A working group also recommended World Athletics merge regulations for both DSD and transgender athletes after it said new evidence showed testosterone suppression "can only ever partly mitigate the overall male advantage in the sport of athletics".

The current rules for DSD athletes require them to reduce their testosterone levels to a set level for at least six months to compete in any female category event internationally.

Coe also addressed the missed payments connected to the Grand Slam Track competition launched by four-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson. Coe said it was "critical" to have a sound financial plan when launching new events.

The league, which began in 2025, offered significant financial incentives, including up to $100,000 (Â£73,600) for winners of race categories as well as salaries for contracted athletes, but has been "unable to meet" the timelines for payments, according to Johnson.

The final event of the season was cancelled in June and Johnson confirmed the competition will not run in 2026 unless athletes receive their owed payments.

"You've got to have the finance in place. That's absolutely critical," Coe said.

"I know Michael, and this is probably sitting badly with him. I absolutely accept that, and I'm sure he's doing everything he possibly can to make sure the athletes get what they've been promised."

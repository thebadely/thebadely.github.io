It has been recently reported that Aoife Wafer was named 2025 Women's Six Nations player of the tournament

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool C: Ireland v Japan

Venue: Franklin's Gardens, Northampton Date: Sunday, 24 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app.

Aoife Wafer has been ruled out of Ireland's opening Women's Rugby World Cup match against Japan as she continues her comeback from knee surgery. 

The 2025 Women's Six Nations player of the tournament underwent a procedure last month which caused her to miss Ireland's warm-up games against Scotland and Canada and she has not yet travelled to England with her team-mates.

The 22-year-old back row was named in head coach Scott Bemand's squad last week but is not fit enough to feature against Japan on Sunday (12:00 BST) and has remained in Dublin to work on her recovery. 

As per the rules of the competition, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) had to inform World Rugby that Wafer had not departed with the squad as players cannot return home during the tournament window to treat injuries as it would be viewed as unfair on those squads who have greater distances to travel. 

Following their opener in Franklin's Gardens, Ireland face Spain on 31 August and back-to-back world champions New Zealand on 7 September in their other Pool C games and the side's assistant coach Larissa Muldoon confirmed that Wafer will join the team next week "in preparation looking into Spain".

Co-captain Edel McMahon, who also did not feature in either of Ireland's warm-up fixtures, is with the squad and according to Muldoon "came through training" on Tuesday and Wednesday with no issues.

Wafer, who will join Harlequins from Leinster after the tournament in England, scored four tries for Ireland in the Six Nations but missed the last game of the championship after damaging knee ligaments against Wales.

Her fitness has become increasingly significant for Ireland following injuries to fellow back rowers Dorothy Wall and Erin King, who will both miss the World Cup.

Muldoon, however, has confidence in Ireland's depth at the position. 

"People forget the like of Claire Boles have come back in, Ivana Kiripati has come through the under-20s pathway," added the former international scrum-half.

"[We have] amazing players coming through and giving us that element of competition in our training environment and identity."

It has been recently reported that Clarke won the National League play-off final with Rovers in 2015

Bristol Rovers have re-appointed Darrell Clarke as their manager following their relegation to League Two.

Rovers sacked head coach Inigo Calderon on Sunday, less than 24 hours after the end of a disappointing season that ended in a 4-1 thumping at Blackpool.

Clarke, 47, had four years in charge of Rovers between 2014-2018, a stint in which he brought them back into the English Football League (EFL) at the first attempt and then instantly won promotion to League One.

"It is difficult to put into words just how special it feels to come back to Bristol Rovers," Clarke said. "I am beyond proud to return and once again be here at this exceptional club.

"Even though the season just gone was undoubtedly a difficult one, the potential of this club remains incredibly high and, when the chance to return came up, I didn't have any hesitation.

"I am excited to get down to work during the off-season, prepare for the new campaign and step out at The Mem once again in front of the brilliant, passionate Gasheads. 

"We will need each and every one of them with us in the season to come and I want to give them a team they can get behind and performances they can be proud of."

After leaving Rovers, Clarke subsequently managed at Walsall, Port Vale, Cheltenham and most recently Barnsley, who he left in March.

While at Vale he also won promotion from League Two via a play-off final win over Mansfield in 2022.

Director of football Ricky Martin said: "I am delighted to welcome Darrell back to Bristol Rovers.

"Following the review of our footballing operation we began our recruitment proceedings, and it quickly became clear to me that Darrell was the right person to take our first team forward. He has been our number one target throughout this process."

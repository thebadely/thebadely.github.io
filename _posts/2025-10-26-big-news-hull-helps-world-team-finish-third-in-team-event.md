It has been recently reported that England's Charley Hull won her singles match to help the World team beat Japan

England's Charley Hull and New Zealand's Lydia Ko won their singles matches to help the World team beat Japan and finish third at the LPGA Tour's International Crown tournament.

Australia stunned the United States in the final to win the biennial competition for the first time.

World number three Minjee Lee beat Angel Yin and Hannah Green defeated Yealimi Noh in their singles matches.

The tournament brings together seven national teams and the World team, each made up of four players who participate in the matchplay event, with a total prize pot of $2m (Â£1,502,855).

"I'm so happy that I could do it with these girls, it was just a lot of fun this whole week," three-time major winner Lee said.

"Playing matchplay is something different and we don't get to do it too often."

Australia beat the World team in Sunday's semi-finals while the USA defeated Japan.

Thailand, China, South Korea and Sweden were eliminated in the pool stage.

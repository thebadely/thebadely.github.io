It has been recently reported that Sir Chris Hoy won Olympic gold medals at the Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Games

Sir Chris Hoy says he is on crutches and "hobbling about" after breaking a leg in a cycling crash which he described as the "worst" of his life.

Six-time Olympic champion Hoy announced in October 2024 that his cancer is terminal, but the 49-year-old has continued to ride his mountain bike since entering "a bit of a stability period" in his treatment.

However, in an interview with Sky Sports, the Scotsman said: "I've smashed my leg up, that's the worst thing that's happened recently. You just don't bounce like you do when you're younger.

"It was a big one. I'm doing better now, I'm still on crutches, hobbling about.

"Worse things happen. I've been riding bikes for 43 years and it's the worst crash I've ever had. I'm pretty lucky that's the worst one I've had in all those years of riding."

Hoy, whose seven Olympic medals also include one silver, is Britain's second-most decorated Olympic athlete behind fellow track cyclist Sir Jason Kenny (seven golds).

He also claimed 11 World Championship golds and 34 World Cup titles before retiring in 2013.

"I want to live my life and I want to make the most of it. None of us are here forever so you want to make the most of the time you have and do the things you enjoy," said Hoy.

"I've just had an unfortunate spill and it's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm doing alright now, I wasn't doing so well in the immediate aftermath of it, but looking forward to Christmas."

Hoy announced in February 2024 that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. 

He confirmed in October 2024 that his diagnosis was terminal after the primary cancer spread to his bones, with doctors giving him between two and four years to live.

Hoy said his terminal cancer diagnosis has improved his life "in some ways" because it has changed his outlook.

"It's changed my life without question, but I think in some ways it's improved my life," Hoy told BBC Sport in November.

"It's changed my outlook on a lot of things. I'm not as bothered by small things. I think I try and focus on the here and the now, enjoying the moment, making the most of today, and trying to find something positive in any situation.

"I'm doing well. I'm able to keep doing all the things that I enjoy, spend a lot of time with my family, and I hope to be around for a lot longer yet."

Here’s what you need to know: Spoiler alert: Winner of I'm a Celebrity... Get me out of here! revealed in Monday's paper review.

The Daily Telegraph says the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, has been reported to the police because of claims he broke rules on campaign spending. The paper says that Richard Everett, a former Reform councillor, who helped Farage win his seat in Clacton in Essex at the general election, submitted the documents to the police. They are said to show that Reform came close to the limit of just over £20,000. But Everett alleges the figure excludes some costs including leaflets, utility bills and the refurbishment of a bar in the campaign office. He says he believes Farage was "blissfully unaware" of the omissions, but the Telegraph says that if the claims are found to be accurate he and his election agent could be found personally liable. In response, Reform UK described Everett as a "disgruntled former councillor" and denied any laws had been broken.

The decision to strip the Duke of Sussex of the right to 24-hour armed police protection when he is visiting the UK from his home in America is to be reviewed by the Home Office, according to the Sun. The paper says it could mean a reunion for King Charles III with his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, who he hasn't seen since 2022. Prince Harry has previously said it is not safe for his family to visit Britain without protection, which ceased when he stopped being a working royal in 2020.

The Guardian highlights figures from an NHS watchdog suggesting that one in seven patient hospital referrals in England get lost, rejected or delayed. The paper says Healthwatch England's survey also found that the majority of those patients only discovered they weren't on a waiting list after chasing the NHS themselves.

According to the Times' lead, every workplace will be required to tell staff about their right to join a union as part of the government's Employment Rights Bill. The paper says an approved statement will be given to workers in an effort to stop "hostile" employers from discouraging union membership. The Conservatives warn the plan will lead to a collapse of British productivity.

And many of the papers carry triumphant pictures of an emotional Lando Norris, after the British driver won his first Formula 1 Championship. The Telegraph says it proves "nice guys win too". The back page headline in the i Paper is "Lando hope and glory".

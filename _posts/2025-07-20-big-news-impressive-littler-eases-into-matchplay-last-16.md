Let's dive into the details: Littler is the second seed at the Blackpool tournament

World champion Luke Littler eased into the second round of the World Matchplay in Blackpool with a comfortable 10-2 win over Ryan Searle.

The 18-year-old's maiden appearance at the Winter Gardens last year had resulted in a first-round defeat by Michael van Gerwen and he was keen to amends this time around.

He was too good for Searle from the outset, winning the first four legs with only 48 darts and he finished with a superb average of 108.92 and 52.6% on his checkouts.

The world number 19 had no answer to the onslaught from Littler who avoided the  fate that befell world number one Luke Humphries who was beaten in his opening match on Saturday.

"I felt very comfortable out there," Littler told Sky Sports. "I was well up for tonight and I'm just so glad to get that win and that winning feeling.

"As people know, I'm not a practiser, but I've been practising for this one and putting in more time at home. I'm glad it has paid off and I can't wait to come back for the next game."

Littler's opponent in the last 16 will be Dutchman Jermaine Wattimena who beat 2021 champion Peter Wright 10-8.

Rob Cross, the 2019 winner also bowed out after a 10-8 loss to Dutchman Dirk van Duijvenbode but the 2018 champion Gary Anderson beat Luke Woodhouse 10-5 to advance.

Fourth seed Stephen Bunting and fifth seed Jonny Clayton also made winning starts but were made to work hard at times by their opponents.

Bunting led Ryan Joyce 8-4 but was pegged back to 8-8 before regrouping  to win 10-8 and set up a meeting with Anderson.

Clayton held off the challenge of German number one Martin Schindler 10-7 despite having a lower average than his opponent â 99.60 compared to 103.45.

"I am here, I want to win this tournament," said the Welshman. "Hopefully it is going to be my week. I love it when I pass the first round."

Let's dive into the details: Alfie Hewett won the Wheelchair Masters singles final in 2017, 2021 and 2023

Great Britain's Alfie Hewett was soundly beaten by Japan's world number one Tokito Oda in the men's singles final of the Wheelchair Masters. 

Three-time former winner Hewett, 27, who was competing in his sixth Masters singles final, was on court for little over an hour as teen star Oda cruised to a 6-1 6-1 victory in Huzhou, China. 

The 19-year-old defending champion, who beat Hewett's doubles partner Gordon Reid in last season's final, continued his recent dominance against the world number two. 

He claimed a 13th win in 22 matches against Hewett, whom he also beat in this season's French Open and Wimbledon men's singles finals. 

Those two finals followed Hewett's victory over Oda in the Australian Open final in January, when the Briton claimed his 10th Grand Slam singles title.

Hewett also finished runner-up in the men's doubles final in Huzhou, losing with Reid to Martin de la Puente and Ruben Spaargaren in a final-set decider on Saturday.

According to new developments, Poppy Maskill (centre), Bethany Firth (right) and Georgia Sheffield (left) with their medals from an all-British top three in the S14 100m backstroke at the World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore

Poppy Maskill won gold, Bethany Firth silver and Georgia Sheffield bronze as Great Britain clinched the top three places in the women's S14 100m backstroke at the World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore.

Returning to global competition following the birth of her daughter, Firth led into the turn, but Maskill, who won gold at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, had just enough to edge the victory in a new championship record time of one minute 5.09 seconds.

Fellow Briton Alice Tai secured her second gold of the championships with victory in the women's S8 100m backstroke.

Tai, who won gold in the women's S8 400m freestyle on Sunday, paced herself perfectly to claim her second win in two days and said: "That's the second fastest time I've done this season which I'm really happy with. 

"I'm trying to manage my week because I've got racing every day so I'm super happy and excited to be on the podium hearing the national anthem again."

Meanwhile, Faye Rogers set a new British record of 2:28.52 to claim silver in the women's SM10 200m individual medley competition, finishing 0.22 seconds behind Turkey's Defne Kurt.

"I got a bit excited in the first 100m, went out a little bit quick, possibly could have been a bit more controlled going out to have a little more coming back, but we live and learn," said Rogers.

"It was a good swim, I'm happy with it being a PB and I was super excited with getting a silver - at the last world champs I won a bronze so that's an improvement."

Ellie Challis won bronze in the women's SM3 150m individual medley and Will Ellard also came third in his final in the men's S14 100m backstroke.

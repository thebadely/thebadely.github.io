Let's dive into the details: Owen Farrell left Saracens following their Premiership play-off semi-final defeat by eventual champions Northampton in May 2024

Former England captain Owen Farrell has agreed to rejoin Saracens, just a year after leaving the club for French side Racing 92.

The 33-year-old has signed a two-year deal after the Premiership club came to an agreement with Paris-based Racing to end his stint in Top 14 a year early.

Farrell, England's record points scorer, previously spent 16 years at Saracens, helping the club win six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups.

He made 256 appearances for the north London side, as well as playing 112 games for England and winning six Test caps for the British and Irish lions.

"Saracens is my home and the opportunity to come back is one that excites me enormously," Farrell told the club website., external

"Having watched from afar this season, it is clear to see that the club has incredible potential, and I can't wait to get back in the mix for the 2025-26 season."

The fly-half's return means he is available for selection by England for their forthcoming tour to Argentina - and in theory he could even make the Lions squad should there be an injury.

Saracens are requiring cover for the injured Alex Lozowski and are allowed dispensation in the salary cap to replace him in their squad for next season.

Farrell made 17 appearances in all competitions for Racing this season as they finished 10th in Top 14, the French top-flight.

He scored one try and kicked 41 points but was dogged by a persistent hip problem before suffering what proved to be a season-ending concussion midway through the first half of Racing's European Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Lyon last month.

But he returns to Saracens  - where he came up through the ranks to make his debut just 11 days after his 17th birthday - as one of the club's greatest-ever players.

Farrell was part of a clutch of international stars - including current Lions captain Maro Itoje, Jamie George and the Vunipola brothers Billy and Mako - who formed the Saracens spine as they dominated club rugby through much of the past decade.

He stayed with the club after they were relegated for breaching salary cap regulations and helped them win the Championship title in 2021 before the club went on to make the next two Premiership finals - winning the title in 2023 as Farrell kicked 13 points in a 35-25 win over sale at Twickenham.

Farrell helped Saracens finish fourth in the 2023-24 season before they were edged out 22-20 by Northampton at Franklin's Gardens in that season's Premiership semi-final.

"Owen has Saracens in his DNA; his competitive spirit is woven into the fabric of this club, and we are delighted he has chosen to come home," director of rugby Mark McCall said.

"He returns to a young group full of potential, players eager to learn, play and push for success. We know he will love being part of where this group, and this club, are headed."

Here’s what you need to know: Guarino has not managed outside of Italy

West Ham are set to appoint Rita Guarino as their women's team manager following the sacking of Rehanne Skinner.

The Italian, who picked up 99 caps for her national team as a player, has not yet managed outside of Italy.

She was most recently in charge of Inter Milan between 2021 and 2024, having previously led Juventus to four successive Serie A titles.

The 54-year-old has experience working with youth teams from her time with Italy's under-17s, who she acted as head coach and assistant for.

Skinner was sacked by West Ham on Thursday after winning only one of their 11 Women's Super League matches this season.

It is believed West Ham had been monitoring the availability of Guarino before the winter break, with a view to appointing her.

Guarino's arrival will be seen as a bold move by West Ham because she is a relative unknown in England.

One of her first priorities will be to navigate the January transfer window as West Ham look to move up the table. They currently sit second bottom, two points above Liverpool.

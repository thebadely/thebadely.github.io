Let's dive into the details: Tributes have been paid following the death of Roly Howard, whose 33-year tenure in charge of the Merseyside club Marine AFC saw him gain a world record at the time for being the longest-serving football manager.

He managed the Crosby-based team for 1,975 games between August 1972 and April 2005 and even worked as a groundsman for the club.

The current team, which competes in the National League, held a minute's silence before Saturday's game after Howard died at the age of 90.

Marine chairman Paul Leary told BBC Radio Merseyside: "He was a hero because for 33 years of his life, he gave 100% of everything to Marine and he was successful." 

During his time at the club, he won five league titles and 15 cup competitions.

He also nurtured football stars including Liverpool and Republic of Ireland player Jason McAteer, who started in Marine's youth set-up.

In addition to his club work, Howard was also a window cleaner, whose clients included former Liverpool boss Sir Kenny Dalglish.

Speaking before his final game as manager in 2005, the then 70-year-old said: "When you are doing it, it doesn't feel like that length of time. But like life itself, when you reflect on it you wonder where the time has gone." 

He was inspired to become Marine's groundsman after seeing the then Stockport manager Eric Webster mowing the grass at their ground.

"I asked him what he was doing and he said 'They never sack the groundsman'. So I looked after the ground for five or six years as well."

He earned a place in the Guinness World Records as the longest-serving football manager.

At his final Marine game as manager, he said: "The involvement and the craic with the players is what I'll miss most. But I always said I would know the time is right and it is."

It has been recently reported that If mealtimes with your child sometimes feel more like negotiations than nourishment, you aren't alone. According to the NHS, more than half of children will show fussy eating habits at some point. 

Charlotte Stirling-Reed, a child and baby nutritionist, spoke to the CBeebies Parental Helpline about the best ways to manage it and said it's important not to blame yourself.

"It's a really normal part of many children's development. There are so many families out there dealing with this.

"Don't feel like it's just you because it isn't."

Whilst seemingly counterintuitive, Charlotte says allowing a child to pick what they want to eat can actually encourage them to try more things. 

"If your little one says, 'I don't want to eat this food,' then saying to them, 'that's okay,' is a much more helpful stance."

As the child grows, they need to make their own decisions, so not suppressing this can help. 

"Kids want autonomy, and us saying to them, 'you don't have to eat it' can often permit them to decide eating it is their choice."

She also suggests allowing them to leave the table when they want, saying prolonging mealtimes will only make the situation worse.

Labelling different foods as good or bad can ultimately impact a child's relationship with what they are eating, says Charlotte. 

"Try and be neutral. Avoid 'if you eat that, you'll get a reward or punishment'. Any of that can have a really negative effect on children."

Instead, Charlotte encourages parents to teach children about balance.

"We don't need to shame different foods, but we might eat some foods less frequently than others. 

"I wouldn't have the conversation about what's healthier or what's not. I'd model it, I'd show them what moderation and variety and balance looks like."

Making meals a more enjoyable experience away from the food itself can take attention away from the problem and encourage them to eat, says Charlotte.

This also helps shift the association of the table as a place where they don't want to be.

"Get a book out, anything you can do to make them want to be at the table. Then you could always say 'we're going to put that book away now and we're going to have our food'. 

"But try not to focus on the food. Try and make the dinner table time fun, chat to them a lot."

As a child reaches the age of one, their growth can begin to slow, which can cause an appetite dip. 

"There are peaks and troughs. Just like we don't always have the same appetite every day, it's the same for our kids."

She says being mindful of this is important.

"It's called responsive feeding, letting them dictate how much they eat. So we set a structure, like breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We offer it at that time and we choose what foods, but we should try and let them decide how much."

If your child is active and growing, then they're probably getting enough food. However, if you're concerned about your child's limited diet or you think they may have other sensory issues, then it's always worth discussing it with your GP.

Including your child as much as possible in food prep and meals can help them become more adventurous. 

Charlotte says simple activities such as helping lay the table, stirring or spreading mixtures, doing the shopping together or even reading about food can all help.

She also advises exposing them to a wide range of foods.

"Children like familiarity. So the more they become familiar with all these foods, the more likely they are to accept them."

This doesn't have to take a lot of time. Charlotte recommends using food items that are quick to use and nutrient-heavy. 

"Things like ground nuts, ground seeds, a handful of frozen fruit or vegetables.

"And also products that you can make a very quick meal out of, such as mixing tinned tomatoes, lentils and frozen veggies, and voila, you've got a really healthy, nutrient-dense pasta sauce."

England star Ellie Kildunne scored a sensational solo try as Harlequins brushed aside Bristol Bears in Premiership Women's Rugby at Allianz Stadium.

Running the ball back from inside her own half, Kildunne - the runner-up in BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025 - showed exceptional pace to regather her own kick and dive over for Quins' third score.

The 26-year-old was playing at the stadium for the first time since scoring another wonder try to help England win the Women's Rugby World Cup final in September.

Saturday's double-header at Twickenham offers fans the chance to watch both Quins and Bristol's men's and women's teams play at the home of English rugby.

Bears wing Millie David quickly brought Red Roses star Kildunne back down to earth by stepping her to score an expertly finished try.

Poor discipline prevented the visitors from posing a threat in the first half, as both Pamphinette Buisa and Sarah Bern spent time in the sin bin.

Harlequins managed to grab their bonus-point try before half-time, with Spain's Claudia Pena going over.

Hooker Amy Dale powered over to reduce the lead, but the hosts responded through two tries by replacement Freya Aucken.

Following only one win from the opening four games, Ross Chisholm's side have now won three consecutive matches, while Bristol are on a six-game losing run.

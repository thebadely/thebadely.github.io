Let's dive into the details: Nathan Maguire won silver in the mixed 4x100m relay at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games

Great Britain's Nathan Maguire thanked his family for helping him achieve his dream after winning T54 1500m bronze at the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi.

Maguire overtook Switzerland's Marcel Hug on the final bend and finished behind Chinese pair Jin Hua and Luo Xingchuan.

The 28-year-old added to the bronze he won in the T54 800m at the 2024 World Championships in Kobe.

"This is what I've dreamed of for my whole career," Maguire told BBC Sport.

"It's always special to be able to do this in front of your family.

"I've never been to a race without my parents with me and I know how much they put into me when I was growing up to get me to this point, so it's a team effort."

Maguire finished fourth in the T54 400m on Tuesday but has the opportunity to pick up another medal in the 800m event this weekend.

Britain's Hannah Taunton missed out on a medal in the women's T20 1500m final as she finished fourth in four minutes 42.95 seconds, seven seconds behind Australia's Annabelle Colman who took bronze.

Brazil's Antonia Keyla Da Silva Barros set a world record of 4:19.22 to take gold.

Sophie Hahn, a two-time Paralympic champion over 100m, finished eighth for Great Britain in the women's T38 200m final in 27.11, with Colombia's Karen Palomeque taking gold with a world record of 24.98.

South Africa overpower debutants Brazil in dominant win

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool D

South Africa (26) 66

Tries: Roos, Hele 3, Malinga 2, Janse van Rensburg 2, Ngwevu, Makua Cons: Dolf 8

Brazil (3) 6

Pens: Kochhann 2

"We are here to show Brazil have more than just soccer."

Fly-half Raquel Kochhann may not have achieved her initial dream of playing football for her country, but she did get the chance to show her kicking skills on the world stage.

Brazil were 12-0 down to South Africa on their Women's Rugby World Cup debut when a penalty was awarded.

From just outside the 22, and at a slight angle, it was that awkward kick that you should get, but it was far from a gimme.

It was never in doubt and Kochhann's historic strike sailed through with ease, as did a penalty in the second half.

Those were the only scores registered by Brazil as they fell to a heavy opening 66-6 defeat, but afterwards the players stressed the significance of becoming the first South American team to make the Women's World Cup.

"We are so excited to be here to show the world Brazilian rugby," said Kochhann.

"I am really sure we are inspiring young girls and players in Brazil to see a future by seeing us play at the highest level possible."

Brazil's World Cup debut was much anticipated because of their sevens flair, but it was their toughness and bravery in defence that stood out.

A large portion of the squad come from tough favelas, and have had to fight harder than most to reach the global stage.

Kochhann, who won her seventh XVs cap in Northampton, is a sevens specialist and has been to three Olympic Games, overcoming breast cancer to feature in Paris last year.

The lowest-ranked team at the tournament in 25th, Brazil had only played 16 Tests of XV-a-side rugby prior to the tournament. They only celebrated their first win in 2023 over Portugal.

Even when the Brazil national anthem ended in Northampton, the players continued to sing full of emotion.

"We screamed to everyone that we are warriors and are ready," Kochhann added.

"It is really important that we had a load of Brazilians here and those supporting us in Brazil. This energy is important to show people are looking out and caring about us.

"It shows rugby matters, I love this energy. I am super excited to see how our team grows.

Bianca Silva's excellent early try-saving tackle on Ayanda Malinga typified that warrior mindset - one of 168 tackles her team made in the game.

Springbok number eight Aseza Hele bagged a hat-trick and was one player Brazil could simply not stop because of her brutal power.

But excellent scramble defence meant South Africa only scored their fourth try right on half-time, before they accelerated clear in the second half.

'Inspiring' & 'tough' - World Cup debutants Brazil

The Brazil supporters remained loud throughout the game, bringing a positive and fun attitude even in defeat.

Nadia is from one of the smallest states in Brazil and relocated to England three years ago.

"It doesn't matter which part of Brazil you are from, and it is huge, but it feels like one, there was no way I couldn't be here as I had to support the team," she told BBC Sport.

"Brazil qualifying for the World Cup has been huge for the country to show how much you can do. This can get more funding, support and people playing."

Fabiano, who was a number eight in his youth, travelled all the way from Sao Paulo for the game with his son Fergus and daughter Bella.

Brazil's women's sevens team have qualified for the past three Olympics and finished ninth in the recent World Series.

"Since the Rio Olympics the sport has grown. We liked that it was fast," he told BBC Sport.

"I heard the women's team warmed up with music and samba while training. It brings happiness to the game, that's why we like it.

"Brazil has the potential to really like XVs, it is a team game like football. We like ball!"

Brazil now face France, who defeated Italy in their opening game, in Exeter next Saturday.

Les Bleues, ranked fourth in the world, are contenders to win the tournament and will be a big step up in competition.

"I think we can improve a lot playing more teams at this level," added Kochhann. "For the next game, I think we can improve step by step and finish our participation here in the best place that we can be."

Here’s what you need to know: The Sharks had lost six of their seven matches before Saturday's encounter

Investec Champions Cup, Pool One

Sharks (21) 28

Tries: Kolisi, Fassi, Van der Merwe, Williams Cons: Whitehead 4

Saracens (15) 23

Tries: Dan, Spink, Willis Cons: Burke Pens: Burke 2

Saracens' ill-discipline proved costly as they fell to a 28-23 Investec Champions Cup defeat by the Sharks in torrential rain at Durban's Kings Park.

The Prem side were set to take a hard-earned lead into the half-time break but a late tackle by Saracens captain Andy Onyeama-Christie gave the ball back to the Sharks.

The South African side punished Saracens by powering up the field and freeing up Edwill van der Merwe to go over in the corner for a 21-15 lead.

With Saracens trailing by just three points midway through the second half, hooker Theo Dan was shown a yellow card for a high tackle. 

The home side took advantage by extending their lead to 28-18 when Springbok scrum-half Grant Williams sprinted past Saracens' stretched defence.

With supreme effort, Saracens cut the gap to five points through Tom Willis' try.

They piled on the pressure, but the Sharks held on to secure their first win in Pool Three in JP Pietersen's first game in charge since replacing John Plumtree as head coach following the Sharks' defeat by Toulouse last weekend.

Saracens, who left out experienced stars Maro Itoje, Jamie George and Owen Farrell to face a Sharks side packed with world champion Springboks, claimed a losing bonus point to move to six points following their bonus-point home win last Saturday.

After South Africa captain Siya Kolisi gave his team an early lead, it looked ominous for a Saracens side showing 10 changes from their opening win over Clermont Auvergne.

Saracens responded well with a try through livewire Dan, which was confirmed when referee Luc Ramos ruled out a possible obstruction in the maul by Harry Wilson.

Mark McCall's side took the lead when Sam Spink touched down unopposed after Aphelele Fassi failed to gather a wet ball on the slide from Elliot Daly's cute kick through.

Fergus Burke kicked a penalty to extend Saracens' lead to 15-7, but Fassi's try, after a powerful run by Sharks captain Andre Esterhuizen, cut the visitors' advantage before Onyeama-Christie's late hit on Williams three minutes later changed the momentum of the match.

Another Burke penalty brought Sarries within range but their task got harder when Dan was sent to the sin-bin for a shoulder-to-head tackle on Makazole Mapimpi.

Ethan Hooker made the crucial break to give Williams the opportunity to sprint over for the home side's fourth try.

Despite being a man down, Saracens muscled their way into the corner and the impressive Willis battled through the mass of bodies to touch down and set up a tense final 15 minutes, but it was not to be as the hosts won for just the second time this season.

Saracens host six-time winners Toulouse in the third round of pool matches on Sunday, 11 January, after the Sharks take on Sale on Saturday, 10 January.

The three-time champions will face Glasgow away in their final pool game on 18 January.

Sarries return to Prem action next Saturday when they welcome Exeter to StoneX Stadium.

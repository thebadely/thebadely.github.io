Here’s what you need to know: An NHS resident doctor has been suspended by a medical tribunal for 15 months after posting alleged antisemitic comments on social media.

Dr Rahmeh Aladwan, a 31-year-old trainee trauma and orthopaedic surgeon, was also alleged to have expressed support for "violent action and terrorist organisations".

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) said Dr Aladwan's posts "may impact on patient confidence" in both her and the profession, while patients could be "discouraged" from seeking treatment from her.

Dr Aladwan, who is British Palestinian, denies making racist or hate speech.

She is currently the subject of a fitness to practise investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), an independent body that regulates doctors, physician associates and anaesthesia associates to protect patient safety.

The GMC began its investigation following complaints that Dr Aladwan had made antisemitic or offensive comments on posts that also appeared to support terrorism.

The tribunal heard that Dr Aladwan's alleged posts on X included antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as posts that "demonise, or express and encourage hatred towards Jews in general, their history and their way of life".

Her lawyer told the tribunal there was "no evidence" that her activities have had "any impact on patient safety or her ability to fulfil her duties as a doctor".

Dr Aladwan's suspension will take effect from today and will be reviewed within six months.

The hearing, which took place in Manchester, was an interim orders tribunal (IOT), deciding whether Dr Aladwan's practice should be restricted while the GMC's investigation takes place.

It does not rule on the allegations under investigation.

In the tribunal's ruling, it said it "notes that there is no information to suggest that any patient complaints have been raised or that any patients have come to harm".

Dr Aladwan was previously subject to an IOT in September, which determined that no restrictions should be imposed upon her.

On 3 October 2025, a decision was made to refer Dr Aladwan's case to an IOT hearing again after the GMC alleged an "escalation in the tone of Dr Aladwan's social media posts" following the September ruling and the Manchester synagogue attack in early October.

Responding to the tribunal's ruling on X, Dr Aladwan said: "Let this decision stand as the definitive proof that there is no independent British medical regulation. The 'Israeli' and Jewish lobby decide who can and cannot practise medicine in Britain."

She added: "This is not an end. It is the beginning of a far greater battle for the integrity of our institutions."

The GMC's social media guidance states that medical professionals have the right to "freedom of belief, privacy, and expression" but that using social media "has to be balanced with the possible impact on other people's rights and interests".

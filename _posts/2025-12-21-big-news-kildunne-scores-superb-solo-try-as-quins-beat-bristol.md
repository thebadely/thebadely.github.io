England star Ellie Kildunne scored a sensational solo try as Harlequins brushed aside Bristol Bears in Premiership Women's Rugby at Allianz Stadium.

Running the ball back from inside her own half, Kildunne - the runner-up in BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025 - showed exceptional pace to regather her own kick and dive over for Quins' third score.

The 26-year-old was playing at the stadium for the first time since scoring another wonder try to help England win the Women's Rugby World Cup final in September.

Saturday's double-header at Twickenham offers fans the chance to watch both Quins and Bristol's men's and women's teams play at the home of English rugby.

Bears wing Millie David quickly brought Red Roses star Kildunne back down to earth by stepping her to score an expertly finished try.

Poor discipline prevented the visitors from posing a threat in the first half, as both Pamphinette Buisa and Sarah Bern spent time in the sin bin.

Harlequins managed to grab their bonus-point try before half-time, with Spain's Claudia Pena going over.

Hooker Amy Dale powered over to reduce the lead, but the hosts responded through two tries by replacement Freya Aucken.

Following only one win from the opening four games, Ross Chisholm's side have now won three consecutive matches, while Bristol are on a six-game losing run.

Last season's finalists Saracens defeated Sale Sharks 36â17 to extend their winning run to seven games.

Canada backs Alysha Corrigan and Liv Apps both scored, with Apps also setting up Bryony Field after an incredible run.

Scrum-half Apps, who joined the club in October as injury cover, also produced an early try-saving tackle in an impressive performance.

In Sunday's second game, Loughborough Lightning and Trailfinders Women played out a thrilling 29â29 draw.

Rosie Inman's 79th-minute try looked to have snatched the game for Trailfinders, but Fancy Bermudez crossed to give Helen Nelson a kick to level the match.

Scotland's Nelson nailed the kick in the 83rd minute to draw an epic encounter.

Leaders GloucesterâHartpury, without a large number of their England stars, rounded off the weekend by hammering Leicester Tigers 75-12 at Mattioli Woods Welford Road.

England wing Mia Venner, who missed out on the final World Cup squad, scored twice, with World Cup-winner Emma Sing finishing with a 30-point tally that included two tries.

GloucesterâHartpury, seeking their fourth league title in a row, top the table and are yet to lose a game, while Leicester are still without a win this season.

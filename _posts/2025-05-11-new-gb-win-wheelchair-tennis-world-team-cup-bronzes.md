It has been recently reported that Andy Lapthorne (left), Greg Slade (centre) and Gary Cox (right) won quad bronze in Turkey

Great Britain won bronze medals in the men's and quad events at the wheelchair tennis World Team Cup in Turkey.

Ben Bartram and Dahnon Ward beat France pair Geoffrey Jasiak and Gaetan Menguy respectively in the singles of the men's bronze medal play-off.

Greg Slade and Gary Cox beat Australia in the deciding doubles to finish third in the quad competition in Antalya.

Australia forced a decider when Benjamin Wenzel beat Andy Lapthorne after Slade had won the opening singles match against Finn Broadbent.

"I'm really happy and very proud of all our efforts this week," said Bartram.

"It's definitely a very deserved bronze medal."

Japan, who beat Britain in the semi-finals, defeated Chile in the final to win the men's title.

The quad title was won by the Netherlands, who beat Brazil in the final. Britain lost 2-0 to Brazil in the semi-finals on Saturday.

 "I'm delighted to have come through, to win the bronze with the team and bounce back from the disappointment of the semi-final against Brazil," said Slade, who, like Cox, secured his first World Team Cup medal.

"We really collected ourselves and went after it and played some really good tennis."

The World Team Cup is wheelchair tennis' biggest team competition, and is the equivalent of the Davis Cup or Billie Jean King Cup.

The Netherlands also won the women's competition, in which Britain were beaten by France in the bronze medal play-off.

Britain's junior team of Ruben Harris and Lucas de Gouveia won gold with both winning their singles matches in the final against the USA.

Experts revealed that An internet prankster has been charged by police after appearing with the Australia team before their rugby league game against England on Saturday.

Daniel Jarvis was seen on BBC One's television coverage standing at the end of Australia's line-up during the national anthems before the game at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.

Merseyside Police said the 37-year-old, from Gravesend in Kent, had been charged with disrupting a person engaged in a lawful activity.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Monday.

It is understood the incident will form part of a Rugby Football League internal review of the event.

Saturday's match was the first non-football event at Everton's new stadium, which opened earlier this year.

Australia won 14-4 to secure victory in the three-Test series, which ends in Leeds next Saturday.

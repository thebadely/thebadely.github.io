British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski came from a set down to beat Christian Harrison and Evan King and reach the French Open men's doubles final.

The eighth seeds, who only paired up at the start of the season, beat the American duo 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 7-6 (10-7).

It is the first time either Salisbury or Skupski have gone beyond the quarter-finals in the men's doubles in Paris.

They will face Spain's Marcel Granollers and Argentina's Horacio Zeballos in Saturday's final from 15:30 BST.

Harrison and King won a tense opening set via a tie-break but the British pair secured an early break in the second to force a decider.

Salisbury and Skupski then had to battle back from a break down in the third set, forcing parity after the Americans served for the match at 5-3.

Harrison and King had a 6-3 lead in the deciding tie-break before Salisbury and Skupski fought back to secure a place in the final.

The pair are bidding for a first Grand Slam title together, having reached finals on the clay in Qatar and Barcelona this year.

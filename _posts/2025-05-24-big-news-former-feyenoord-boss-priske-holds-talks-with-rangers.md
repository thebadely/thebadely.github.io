It has been recently reported that Brian Priske is available after leaving Feyenoord in February 

Former Feyenoord manager Brian Priske is a contender to be the next Rangers manager after holding talks with the Scottish Premiership club.

The 48-year-old has spoken with the Ibrox hierarchy as they search for a permanent replacement for Philippe Clement, who was sacked in February. 

The process remains on-going, with Priske one of a number of candidates to be linked with the position and no decision yet made after it was confirmed interim boss Barry Ferguson would leave. 

Davide Ancelotti - son of new Brazil head coach Carlo - has been linked with the post, while former Ibrox defender Russell Martin and ex-manager Steven Gerrard - who won the title in 2021 - have also been mentioned. 

Last week, Rangers chief executive Patrick Stewart said the search is "progressing well, and we look forward to concluding our process in the coming period". 

Rangers have finished second in the Premiership, 17 points behind Celtic. 

Is Gerrard returning? And is he what Rangers need?

Ancelotti set for further Rangers talks - gossip

Priske is available after leaving Feyenoord in February, having won 17 of his 33 games in charge, before being replaced by Robin Van Persie. 

He joined from Sparta Prague in June 2024 and drew 3-3 at Manchester City in the Champions League, coming from 3-0 down with 16 minutes left in November. 

Feyenoord also beat Bayern Munich 3-0 in the league stage in January to finish 11th but Priske left a few weeks later, with the club citing "inconsistent results and a lack of chemistry".

The former Denmark defender has managed Midtjylland in his homeland and Royal Antwerp in Belgium, and made 24 appearances for his country. 

Rangers fans, what do you think about the prospect of Priske talking over?

Would be the right fit for the club?

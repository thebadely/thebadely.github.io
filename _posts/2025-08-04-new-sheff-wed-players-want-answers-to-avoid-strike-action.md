It has been recently reported that Sheffield Wednesday are scheduled to start the season with a trip to Leicester City on Sunday

Sheffield Wednesday's players have not ruled out going on strike as the uncertainty at the club continues.

The Championship side have endured a torrid off-season, with players and staff seeing their wages delayed in May, June and July.

Over the summer the club have been handed a number of registration embargoes, boss Danny Rohl has left by mutual consent, the North Stand has been closed by the council amid concerns over its structural integrity and owner Dejphon Chansiri is looking to sell - although no progress has been made with any potential buyers.

Wednesday, who are scheduled to start the league season with a trip to relegated Leicester City on Sunday, were supposed to face Premier League Burnley in a training match on Saturday but the game was cancelled after they refused to play.

In a statement seen by BBC Radio Sheffield, the players said: "As has been well publicised, players, coaching and club staff groups at the club have all been impacted by delayed and overdue payment of salaries. 

"This has been a worrying time for us as players but, whilst we are often the ones in the spotlight, we are not the only ones involved. We stand together in support with all our colleagues employed by the club who have been affected.

"Players and staff are now feeling real, practical impacts in their professional and personal lives and we are extremely concerned at the lack of clarity regarding what is happening and when this will be resolved.

"The decision taken by the players to withdraw from the planned friendly with Burnley was not taken lightly or without consideration.

"We are fully aware of the added concern this will have caused supporters but trust there is a real understanding of the difficult position we have been put in.

"We want to reassure fans that there has not been, and will not be, any 'downing of tools' by any of us on the training ground, and we are all working as hard as we can and supporting each other, the manager and staff.

"However, we, like you, want our focus to be fully on what happens on the pitch and the new season ahead.

"This is proving to be really challenging and we have made it clear to the club that we want this situation to be addressed as soon as possible so decisions taken like the one not to play at Burnley are avoided in the future. We can then all move forward together as a club."

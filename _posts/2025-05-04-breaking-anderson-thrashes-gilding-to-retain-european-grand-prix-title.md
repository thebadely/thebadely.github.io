Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gary Anderson has won back-to-back European Grand Prix titles

Gary Anderson thrashed Andrew Gilding to retain his European Grand Prix title in Sindelfingen, Germany.

The Scot, 54, cruised to an 8-0 victory to become the first player to defend the title.

Gilding had comprehensively beaten his fellow Englishman Luke Woodhouse 7-3 in the semi-final, but he missed 13 double finishes and was ruthlessly punished by Anderson. 

A 141 checkout saw Anderson pull 4-0 ahead and he did not drop a leg throughout the match.

Earlier, he had beaten Englishman Martin Lukeman 6-5 in a tense quarter-final, but found his form against Dirk van Duijvenbode in the semis with an average of over 106 and a run of five straight legs to seal a 7-2 victory.

Anderson's fellow Scot Peter Wright was knocked out in the quarter-final by Gilding with a 6-1 defeat, while Luke Humphries lost 6-5 to Michael Smith in the last 16.

World champion Luke Littler withdrew from the event.

Chevalier 'dealt with scrutiny well' - Laurens

Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique made a "brutal call" in replacing Gianluigi Donnarumma with Lucas Chevalier as the European champions move away from an "older-style goalkeeper".

Despite his heroics last season as the club won the Champions League, Italian Donnarumma was dropped for Wednesday's Super Cup meeting with Tottenham - and made available for transfer with one year left on his contract.

Chevalier, signed from Lille earlier this week, has been handed the starting role and helped PSG overcome Tottenham on penalties following a dramatic 2-2 draw in Udine.

Luis Enrique said the decision was "100%" his as the PSG boss opted for a "different profile" of goalkeeper in the 23-year-old Chevalier.

While Donnarumma's saves were crucial in helping the French side to glory in May as they thrashed Inter Milan 5-0, he has often been criticised for his ability with the ball at his feet.

French football journalist Julien Laurens said "without Gianluigi Donnarumma, I don't think PSG win the Champions League".

Yet he also understood why they went "with someone different" as he told BBC Radio 5 Live: "They have made a call, a brutal call. Lucas Chevalier is better on the ball, better in the air, better with distribution, but he doesn't have the experience. 

"All eyes were on him as he replaces probably the best goalkeeper in the world right now."

In making a decision that has surprised many in world football, Luis Enrique believes Chevalier will improve PSG even more, especially with his team's playing style.

The French keeper has been likened to a five-a-side player because of the quality of his touch, vision and ability to break lines with his passing from the back. 

Chevalier can effectively turn into an outfield player for PSG when in possession as they look to build an attack from their own defensive line.

Replacing Donnarumma will be tough, but he stepped up successfully as Lille's first choice in the 2022-23 season after just a season in Ligue 2 with Valenciennes. Pressure should not be an issue. 

Chevalier was named Ligue 1's best goalkeeper last term with 11 clean sheets as his side finished fifth, while earning a call-up to France's senior squad.

Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson told BBC Radio 5 Live: "The goalkeeper situation is a huge decision from Luis Enrique. Gianluigi Donnarumma is the best shot stopper and he is the best version of the older-style goalkeeper, but they have been replaced by the modern-day keeper who play in the defensive third.

"Luis Enrique is leaning into the way that modern teams want to play and build from the back. PSG are looking for that ninth degree, that tiny little bit of percentage of advantage and with Lucas Chevalier they feel they can further refine their style."

Signs of what Chevalier will bring were seen during his debut against Spurs, with PSG opting to go short on goal-kicks and showing no fear when using him in general play.

He should have done better with Cristian Romero's header that put the Premier League side 2-0 ahead, but showed great reflexes in a stunning save to push Joao Palhinha's effort on to the bar, although Micky van de Ven netted the rebound for Spurs' opener.

Chevalier then stopped Van de Ven's penalty in the shootout as PSG won after a superb comeback in normal time from 2-0 down.

It was a bold move by Luis Enrique to turn to the Frenchman, but one that could prove a masterstroke in the future if Chevalier lives up to great expectations.

But why would a goalkeeper, favourite to be crowned the world's best this year, be frozen out like this?

Luis Enrique has said he wanted a "different profile" to what Donnarumma gave his side. 

Before the Super Cup, the PSG boss clarified it was "100%" his decision to cut Italy's first-choice stopper from his squad, with Donnarumma "disappointed and disheartened" by the outcome.

The 26-year-old arrived from AC Milan on a free transfer in 2021 and enhanced his reputation in Paris.

But with football continuing to evolve, goalkeepers are not just shot stoppers, but are also used as deep-lying playmakers to open up a new dimension of play. This is why Ederson has proved so valuable for Manchester City. 

Pep Guardiola's side have been linked with Donnarumma, but Laurens said he is "not a Pep Guardiola-type of keeper".

"Manchester City are the only club in for Gianluigi Donnarumma at the moment," he added. "I'm amazed by it. But he is not good in the air and not great on the ball."

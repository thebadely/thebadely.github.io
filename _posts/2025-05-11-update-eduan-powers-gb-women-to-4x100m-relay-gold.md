Great Britain women win World 4x100m gold

Success Eduan produced a storming last leg to help Great Britain claim gold in the women's 4x100m at the World Relay Championships in Guangzhou, China.

Eduan passed both Jamaica's Shericka Jackson and Maria Perez, of Spain, on the final straight as a GB team also consisting of Nia Wedderburn-Goodison, Amy Hunt and Bianca Williams won in 42.21 seconds.

Spain ended up second in 42.28 and a Jamaica quartet, which included former world and Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, were third with 42.33.

"I did not think too much of [the] others, I just knew that if I gave my all, it would come out all right," said Eduan.

"I have a mentality of a winner, I don't care if Shericka or Shelly-Ann, respect to them, are running. I am going to give my all and I'm going to pass them and I'm going to win. And we did that."

Great Britain also won a bronze in the inaugural mixed 4x100m race, with Asha Philip, Kissiwaa Mensah, Jeriel Quainoo and Joe Ferguson finishing in 40.88 seconds.

Canada won the race in 40.30, just ahead of Jamaica in 40.44, while the United States won the mixed 4x400m with a championship-record time of three minutes, 09.54 seconds.  

South Africa won the men's 4x100m gold in 37.61 seconds but there was drama as Jamaica failed to book their place in the event at the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo, Japan.

Having dropped a baton during a heat on Saturday, they also failed to take a second chance to qualify via Sunday's heats.

The top two in their heat would have secured a spot in Tokyo but Julian Forte pulled up injured on the second leg as they failed to finish.

Jamaica can still claim one of the two remaining places which are awarded based on the world rankings.  

South Africa also won the men's 4x400m with a time of 2:57.50, while Spain won the women's 4x400m in 3:24.13.

Here’s what you need to know: Will Jacks and Sam Curran have played for Oval Invincibles since The Hundred's inception in 2021

MI London have retained England all-rounders Sam Curran and Will Jacks for the 2026 men's Hundred, while also signing England batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge for the women's competition.

Curran, 27, will captain the franchise, who were known as Oval Invincibles until their recent takeover.

Curran and Jacks have been named in England's squad for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka starting next month.

Wyatt-Hodge, England women's leading T20 run-scorer, joins from Southern Brave.

She reached the final four times with her former side, winning in 2023, and is the competition's second-highest run-scorer of all time.

Teams are allowed to directly sign or retain four players before the auction - a new addition for this season - set to take place in March.

The men's franchise, who as the Invincibles won the competition for the past three years with a settled side, therefore faced a difficult choice in who to retain.

In Curran and Jacks, they have opted for two powerful batters, while Curran also bowls left-arm seam and Jacks is an off-spin option.

England internationals Sam Billings, who captained the side, Tom Curran, Gus Atkinson, Saqib Mahmood and Jordan Cox - all of whom have played exclusively for the Invincibles - were among the players not retained.

Though teams are limited to four signings in the pre-auction window, they could re-sign former players at the event.

Wyatt-Hodge provides the women's franchise, who won the first two titles but have not been back to the final since, with a landmark signing.

All three play for Surrey, who hold a 51% ownership stake in MI London, where Curran is also the T20 skipper.

"This is a real statement of intent from our playing teams," said MI London chair Oli Slipper.

"In Sam and Will, we have signed two of the best English white-ball cricketers there are.

"Danni is a fan favourite in south London with her performances for Surrey and England and has already tasted success at the Kia Oval.

"She's been prolific in The Hundred and is one of the most exciting players in the game."

The 2026 season is the MI London's first since Reliance Industries Limited bought a 49% share of the franchise.

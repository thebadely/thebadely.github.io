It has been recently reported that Sam Curran took his hat-trick in his 65th T20 international appearance for England

First T20 international, Pallekele

Sri Lanka 133 all out (16.2 overs): Kusal Mendis 37 (20); Rashid 3-19, Curran 3-38

England 125-4 (15 overs): Salt 46 (35); Malinga 2-24

Scorecard

Sam Curran took England's second ever hat-trick in T20 internationals as they beat Sri Lanka by 11 runs (DLS) in Pallekele.

The left-arm seamer dismissed home captain Dasun Shanaka and lower-order batters Maheesh Theekshana and Matheesha Pathirana as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 133.

The hosts had already lost five wickets for 22 runs after spinners Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson tore through their line-up, taking 3-19 and 2-31 respectively.

Curran had been expensive earlier in the innings, conceding 36 runs from his first two overs, but returned in force before Jamie Overton wrapped up the innings, which had been shortened to 17 overs after rain earlier in the day.

Having won the preceding ODI series 2-1, England were looking to take their form into the shortest format as they build up to the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka next month.

They looked comfortable in their reply, with Phil Salt hitting 46 from 35 balls at the top of the order.

Jos Buttler was bowled by Eshan Malinga in the third over after hitting the seamer for four successive fours, and the same bowler removed Jacob Bethell for nine.

Tom Banton hit back-to-back sixes off Wanindu Hasaranga, but was caught superbly in the covers by Charith Asalanka off Parithana, while Salt chipped Shanaka to long-on with the finish in sight.

The rain returned two balls later with England needing nine from 12 deliveries and the umpires swiftly drew a conclusion to proceedings.

England go 1-0 up in the three-match series, with the next game at the same ground on Sunday.

Curran's hat-trick marks the latest stage in a successful return to the international fold over the last five months.

The Surrey all-rounder, who in 2022 became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League, returned to England's white-ball squads in September having not played for his country since November 2024.

Curran was selected after a sparkling Hundred campaign for winners Oval Invincibles, and having a developed an elaborate super-slow "moon ball" to deceive opposition batters.

He didn't need such tricks for his trio of wickets, which were taken from the last three balls of the 16th over as he finished with figures of 3-38:

Dasun Shanaka fired the ball straight to Harry Brook at mid-off to depart for 20 off 16 ball.

Maheesh Theekshana chipped the ball meekly to Jamie Overton off the rope at long-on.

Matheesha Pathirana failed to read a ball from round the wicket and was bowled.

The hat-trick was England's second in the format, after Chris Jordan achieved the feat at the 2024 T20 World Cup against the United States.

Sri Lanka had looked in a strong position after Pathum Nissanka (23) and Kusal Mendis (37) put on a partnership of 52 off 28 balls, reaching 76-1 in the eighth over.

However from there, England's spinners tore through the middle order, taking a wicket in five consecutive overs, with Rashid and Dawson dramatically stalling the Sri Lankan innings. 

Shanaka did show signs of resistance with two big sixes, including one off Jofra Archer, who was back in the England line-up after missing the last two Ashes Tests with a side strain.

Curran cut off his charge, before Overton, who had dismissed Kamil Mishara for England's first wicket, came back to bowl Wanindu Hasaranga, with Sri Lanka losing their last four wickets for four runs.

Salt has established himself as one of the premier top-order batters in T20 cricket, winning the Indian Premier League in the last two seasons and earning himself a sizeable contract with Hundred franchise Welsh Fire this month.

The Lancashire opener started England's innings in dramatic fashion, hitting Theekshana for six then successive fours to get his side off to a flier.

The 29-year-old had his share of good fortune, surviving drops on 17, 27 and 41.

Mishara and Nissanka both put down simple chances either side of Dhananjaya de Silva not managing to get his hands on a tough chance.

England's batters were preparing for the turning pitches they'll expect to face in Mumbai and Kolkata in the group stage of the World Cup, but Hasaranga was the only spinner in Sri Lanka's attack.

Pathirana was the pick of the home bowlers, taking 1-18 from his four overs, but Malinga cost 24 runs for his two overs, while Theekshana's 18 balls went for 31.

England have now beaten Sri Lanka in nine successive T20 internationals, a run starting in 2016.

According to new developments, Rado Vidosic had an extensive coaching career in Australia before joining Brighton

Rado Vidosic, Brighton's women's and girls' head of coaching and father of women's head coach Dario, has died aged 64.

Last week the Women's Super League club said Dario would be taking a period of leave as he deals with a family matter in Australia.

Rado, who was born in Osijek in the former Yugoslavia, joined Brighton last January and played "an important role in the team's historic 2024-25 campaign, helping the side achieve a record WSL finish of fifth," the club said.

Brighton's women's and girls' managing director Zoe Johnson said Rado Vidosic had been "an integral part" of the club and that his impact would "forever be remembered".

"All our love and thoughts are with Dario and his family at this difficult time," she added.

Women's chair Michelle Walder added: "As well as being a hugely respected coach, he was a well-loved member of our club who was a key part of building our strong team culture."

He had previously spent six years with Melbourne City in Australia, working with both the men's and women's sides, and had also held coaching roles with Brisbane Roar, Sydney FC, Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix.

Rado worked as Melbourne City's academy technical director before taking on the role of women's head coach. He then managed the men's team and won the A-League title with them.

Melbourne City said Rado was "a highly respected figure whose impact and influence on our club, and Australian football at large, will endure for many years to come."

Brighton assistant head coach Chris Roberts and first-team coach Arthur Brammer have taken charge in Dario's absence, with the pair overseeing wins against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup fourth round and Everton in the WSL.

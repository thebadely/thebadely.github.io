Experts revealed that Gerwyn Price has won the Polish Masters for the first time

Welshman Gerwyn Price evaded a Stephen Bunting fightback to seal the title with an 8-7 success in a thrilling final at the Polish Darts Masters.

Bunting found himself 7-5 down and looked to have missed the opportunity to keep his chances alive when he missed three darts at double 12 at 7-6, but he eventually pinned a double three after Price missed three match darts.

Price strayed into the single 17 with 91 left but hit a double-double finish on 34 and 40 to secure his fourth World Series triumph.

Price won matches against Rob Cross, Chris Dobey and Sebastian Bialecki to reach the final, while Bunting set aside defending champion Luke Littler as well as Krzystof Ratajski and Tytus Kanik.

Littler, who failed to defend his Polish Masters crown, was knocked out of the US Masters in the quarter-finals last week and lost in the last 16 at the World Cup of Darts alongside Luke Humphries. 

A 170 finish when 6-2 down was not enough for Littler to mount a semi-final fightback against Bunting and improve his recent form as the 18-year-old fell to a 7-3 defeat.

Here’s what you need to know: Liam Delap is the son of former Stoke midfielder Rory Delap

Ipswich forward Liam Delap has been given permission to explore "his options" for next season and speak to other clubs, says manager Kieran McKenna. 

The 22-year-old joined the Tractor Boys from Manchester City in a deal worth up to Â£20m last summer but is expected to leave the club following their relegation back to the Championship after just one campaign in the Premier League.

Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle have all been linked with a move for the England Under-21 international, who has a Â£30m relegation release clause in his contract, while City also hold a buy-back option.

"Liam's looking at his options for next year, which I think he is entitled to do and we support him with that," said McKenna.

"I think we have given him permission to do that this week. It's a very important decision for his future. Of course there is a lot of interest - and rightly so. I think part of his week has been having some of those conversations.

"It looks more likely than not that he will move on this summer and he has interest from pretty much every club in the league, and I don't think there are many clubs in the world who wouldn't want to have him.

"Nothing is sorted, nothing is done or completed or even very, very, very close, so that process will take its course."

Delap will look to add to his 12 goals in 36 Premier League appearances when Ipswich host West Ham on Sunday (16:00 BST). 

However, no other Ipswich player has got close to double figures in the top flight with the club's swift return to the second tier confirmed in April.

"We will be proud of the part that we have had in terms of Liam's development and his contribution this season," McKenna added.

"If he stays with us, we will be delighted, and if he moves on this summer, it will be a positive sign for the club to have developed and sold a player at that sort of level and hopefully it will be a good move for him as well."

McKenna also confirmed midfielder Massimo Luongo will leave Portman Road this summer when his contract expires but talks are ongoing with defenders Cameron Burgess and Axel Tuanzebe over possible extensions.

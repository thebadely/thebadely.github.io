According to new developments, Dog attack survivors have described the devastating physical and mental impact of their injuries, as new data shows thousands have sought medical treatment for dog attacks over the past five years.

William Newbury, 22, who was attacked by three dogs in April and suffered severe injuries across his body, said the ordeal had left him unable to cope.

"I'm unable to work and as a result I'm down more than Â£8,000. I'm also struggling with being at home all the time," said Mr Newbury, who lost the use of two fingers in the attack.

Police forces across England and Wales have seen an increase in the number of dog attacks on people during the past five years.

Mr Newbury, from Cardiff, was visiting a friend and her baby when they were attacked by three dogs and he stepped in to protect them.

"The support coming out of hospital was phenomenal, but now I'm not coping," said Mr Newbury, who has been unable to return to his job in security since the attack.

"It's affected my confidence, when I'm out I get funny looks because I have scars on my arms, and it makes me want to wear a jumper so no-one can see it," he added.

Mr Newbury said while colleagues, friends and family had been supportive, people generally "don't understand the aftermath".

He said he was paying for weekly counselling sessions due to NHS waiting lists.

The Welsh government said it was making progress to reducing waiting times for mental health services in the face of increasing demand for support.

Mr Newbury said his experience meant he looked for what he described as "safe spaces" when he leaves his home.

"I still love dogs but naturally I'm wary of them. I love dogs from a distance, shall we say."

He added: "The other day I went for a walk through St David's shopping centre, and parked there because I know dogs aren't in there unless it's for a medical reason like a guide dog."

He said he had been overwhelmed by kind gestures and comments which he was incredibly grateful for.

A garage in Cardiff replaced his car key - which was damaged in the attack - for free, while another company sent him a free watch.

"They said they knew how tough it was for me to be stuck inside, so that it's something to look at to cheer me up."

He said his girlfriend Jamie-lee, who witnessed the attack through the window, had helped him with everything since leaving hospital.

"I don't know where I'd be without her," he added.

BBC Wales requested information from health boards in Wales which showed 2,910 people sought medical treatment for a dog bite or attack over the last five years.

The latest data for England showed there were more than 43,000 reports of dog attacks made by health boards and trusts from 2020 to November 2024. 

Police forces across England and Wales have also seen an increase in the number of dog attacks on people during the past five years.

There were 32,568 recorded offences in 2024 - a 4% increase on 2023's total of 31,398, according to Freedom of Information figures obtained by the BBC from every police force in England and Wales.

The actual attack figures are likely to be higher as the data only counts incidents that were reported to police.

Prof Vivien Lees, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said the severity of injuries caused by dog attacks could vary greatly.

"In the most severe cases patients may require reconstructive surgery and long-term rehabilitation to regain mobility and quality of life," said Prof Lees.

"There is an ongoing need for awareness and vigilance. Dogs can pose a serious risk, particularly when they are poorly trained, neglected, or mistreated."

Erin Evans, 22, from Gwynedd, was bitten by a dog on her face four years ago while out with friends.

"It's a bit of a blank, I just remember there was loads of blood and then I collapsed," said Ms Evans.

It left her needing four years of surgery to reconstruct her top lip.

"When it started to sink in what had happened, I started feeling really low. Looking back I should have asked for help," Ms Evans said.

The attack led to Ms Evans dropping out of her nursing degree and losing confidence.

"I used to be bubbly and happy all the time, but I really struggled and couldn't carry on. I was constantly back and forth to the hospital and found it hard to talk about."

She said she still experienced flashbacks and was wary of dogs, despite having three herself and being an animal lover.

"After what I've been through I'm cautious, but I still love all breeds of dogs."

Once she had the all clear from the NHS that her reconstructive procedures had healed, Ms Evans had a cosmetic tattoo on her lip.

"Before I'd try to hide my lip, but I'm not like that anymore, I even get lots of compliments now," she said.

Imogen Hughes, a permanent make up artist based in Conwy who carried out the cosmetic work on Ms Evans' lips, said she focused on making them appear "more symmetrical".

A before and after social media post online by Ms Hughes of the work has had more than a million views, thousands of likes and hundreds of positive comments.

"I had so many messages that week from girls who had similar experiences, including as far as the US," said Ms Hughes.

However, she warned that this sort of tattooing could be complex.

"The last thing you want to do is add any more trauma to the area, so seek reviews and healed results from companies you're interested in," she added.

Ms Evans has since graduated from a degree in childhood and youth studies, and said she felt much more positive about the future. 

"I wish someone had been there to tell me it would get better, and now I want to do that for other people," she said.

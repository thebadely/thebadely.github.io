Hereâ€™s what you need to know: US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a "30% or 35%" tariff on Japan if a deal between the two countries is not reached before a deadline next week.

That would be well above the 24% tariff Japan was hit with as part of Trump's so-called "Liberation Day" on 2 April, when he announced steep import duties on countries around the world.

The tariffs on most US trading partners, including Japan, were later lowered to 10% for 90 days to give them time to negotiate deals with Washington.

That pause is due to expire on 9 July and Trump has said he is not planning to extend the deadline.

Trump also continued to cast doubt that an agreement could be reached with Tokyo.

"We've dealt with Japan. I'm not sure we're going to make a deal. I doubt it," he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday.

Japan declined to comment on Trump's threat to hike tariffs during a news conference on Wednesday.

"We are aware of what President Trump said, but we don't comment on every remark made by US government officials," the country's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko Aoki said.

Like many other countries, most of Japan's exports to the US currently face a 10% levy. There is also a 25% import tax on Japanese vehicles and parts, while steel and aluminium are subject to a 50% tariff.

On Tuesday, Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not make concessions that could hurt his country's farmers to strike an agreement with Washington.

The comments came after Trump criticised countries over their trade policies towards the US, focussing on Japanese rice imports.

"To show people how spoiled Countries have become with respect to the United States of America, and I have great respect for Japan, they won't take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage," he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Trump originally said he would sign 90 trade agreements during the pause on the new tariffs but since then only the UK has struck a deal with the US.

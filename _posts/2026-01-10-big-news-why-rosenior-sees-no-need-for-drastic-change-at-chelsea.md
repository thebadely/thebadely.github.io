Rosenior wins first game as Chelsea thrash Charlton

New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior says he did "nothing tactical, nothing technical" before his first match against Charlton - a sign of the likely direction of travel under his leadership.

That is not to say the 41-year-old lacks innovation or the ability to nullify opponents, but his similarities to predecessor Enzo Maresca mean he does not need to reinvent the wheel.

When asked by BBC Sport why he had not made any noticeable tactical changes before Chelsea's 5-1 victory in the FA Cup third round, Rosenior said: "This is a team that won the Club World Cup. That was five months ago. This is a team that won the Conference League last year. We're a good team.

"We are a good team. They've been well coached. I've made no secret of that."

Rosenior was appointed to build on Maresca's work, knowing the way Chelsea play, having been part of their multi-club model at French club Strasbourg. 

By design, the two clubs play almost the same way, allowing players and now a head coach to move freely between the two. On Saturday, Chelsea played in the same 4-2-3-1 shape used by Maresca but built up in a 3-2-2-3 system used by Rosenior at Strasbourg. 

However, that is not to say there have been no changes. Chelsea have struggled to retain leads this season, dropping 15 points from winning positions in the Premier League, winning just one of their past nine league matches.

"No, I think the biggest thing I challenged the players on was our reactions to setbacks, our intensity. I was very happy with the togetherness and the spirit of the group today," Rosenior added.

"I was very happy with the intensity that they ran at â winning duels, winning headers, all of the basics. And that's where you get your joy from."

Sources involved in Rosenior's first sessions say intensity was a key theme, one of the principles he hammered home in his first media conference, and something that has, at times, been a failing for Chelsea during long spells of ponderous possession.

They have also been vulnerable at set-pieces and again conceded when Miles Leaburn made it 2-1 in the second half at The Valley, before running out comfortable winners.

"We need to improve in that aspect as well â long throws, wide free-kicks, corners going into our box. They are the basics that I talk about in football," Rosenior explained.

It appears the system and style of play is low on Rosenior's to-do list, with so many matches to come, and such little time to prepare. 

Liam Rosenior is the first Chelsea manager to win their opening game since Antonio Conte in 2016

In truth, Chelsea's 5-1 win flattered them on Saturday, but substitutes Liam Delap, Pedro Neto, Enzo Fernandez and Estevao Willian proved too much for a tired Charlton side to cope with.

Rosenior is the first Chelsea manager to win his opening game since Antonio Conte in August 2016, enjoying the biggest winning margin since Luiz Felipe Scolari in August 2008.

"I have to say I was delighted with the starting XI," Rosenior said. "I was delighted with the front three. I felt Ale [Garnacho] kept going in his one-v-ones.

"Marc Guiu was magnificent, deserved his goal. Jamie [Gittens] looked like he was going at the defenders. He looked like he could create in a lot of moments. So a lot of real positives and a good start."

The most impressive performer was defender Jorrel Hato, who scored the opening goal and playing in a role filled by Marc Cucurella last season.

Hato, 19, made inverted runs into attacking midfield positions when Chelsea were on the front foot, found himself in dangerous areas and ultimately capitalised.

The Â£37m summer signing from Ajax has previously struggled at Stamford Bridge, but since Maresca left the club, he has produced arguably his three best performances, playing significant minutes against Manchester City and Fulham in recent league matches.

"I saw him play at Fulham," Rosenior said. "I was so impressed with him then. He's taken that form on to another level today. Not just in terms of his goal â I felt his defensive attributes were top."

There was concern when Rosenior explained Cole Palmer, Reece James and Malo Gusto were left out because of to knocks sustained in defeat at Fulham last Wednesday â particularly with tougher tests to come.

Arsenal are next in the Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday, while Chelsea welcome Brentford to Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

"He is going to be judged on how he does against decent teams in the Champions League, against Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa â those are the teams he will be judged against, so we will have to see," former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told 5 Live.

"He has got a great month with a lot of games where he can see a lot of players. Four home league games, two away league games â and one of them is Wolves, who haven't had a great season so far.

"There's no easy route, but this is as friendly as it could be. He will have learned which of his players are fringe players. There are quite a few he will be pleased with."

It wasn't all happiness, though: Chelsea supporters continued their protest against the ownership throughout the match and even chanted "attack, attack, attack" as their team waited until the brink of half-time for the breakthrough.

The atmosphere among fans remains febrile amid distrust of the ownership. It is a potential pitfall for Rosenior to be wary of given that, as a recruit from Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's other club Strasbourg, he could easily be labelled a yes-man.

When asked about the chants, Rosenior said: "All I'm going to focus on at the moment is working as hard as I possibly can to help this team achieve the potential â the unlimited potential â that it has. And if you concentrate and focus on your work, hopefully people will see that we're onto a good thing."

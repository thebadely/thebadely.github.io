Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Rangers are eighth in the Scottish Premiership after one win in seven games

Rangers have compiled a new shortlist containing more than two candidates after Steven Gerrard ruled himself out of the running for the vacant head coach's role.

Former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl reportedly held talks with the Rangers hierarchy last week, before Gerrard's withdrawal.

However, Graham Potter, who recently left West Ham United, former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Gary O'Neil and ex-Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick - who had all been linked with the job - are not among the candidates.

Any announcement of a replacement for the sacked Russell Martin is unlikely to come in the next 48 hours.

Suggestions that fresh attempts were made to change Gerrard's mind are not true, according to Ibrox sources.

Is Rohl answer for Rangers? Or 'rinse and repeat'?

Gerrard rejects chance to return as Rangers boss

Gerrard turned down the chance to return, with the timing of the move believed to be behind his decision.

The former Liverpool and England captain held talks with the Scottish Premiership club last week following Russell Martin's dismissal as head coach.

Those discussions were thought to have gone well but the 45-year-old opted against a second stint in Glasgow.

It leaves the fledgling Rangers hierarchy searching for a head coach to succeed Martin, who lasted just 17 matches after being appointed in June.

They sit eighth in the Scottish top flight, having won just once in their opening seven league matches, with their next game the visit of Dundee United next Saturday.

Martin was appointed on a three-year deal following a takeover of Rangers by a US-based consortium in the summer - led by now-chairman Andrew Cavanagh.

It took Rangers until late September to win in the league and they were humiliated 9-1 on aggregate by Club Brugge in the Champions League play-offs.

Martin left with the club 11 points behind leaders Heart of Midlothian and nine behind Celtic, having overseen five victories in all competitions.

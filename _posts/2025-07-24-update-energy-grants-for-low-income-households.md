According to new developments, Low-income households in Hull can apply for funding to make their homes warmer and cheaper to heat.

Hull City Council said it had secured Â£3.4m from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to help reduce fuel poverty and enable eligible residents to make energy-saving home improvements.

The money will be allocated over a three-year period, officials said.

The scheme covers things like wall, loft and underfloor insulation, air-source heat pumps and solar panels.

Councillor Paul Drake-Davis, portfolio holder for housing, said: "Even though we're currently experiencing warm, summer weather, it's really not that long until things turn colder, so we want to let residents know that there is help available ahead of the autumn and winter.

"Because there is limited funding available, we need to make sure it's used wisely to help us support those who need it most," he added.

To be eligible certain criteria must be met and people can find out more and apply via the government website or by contacting the council's warm homes team.

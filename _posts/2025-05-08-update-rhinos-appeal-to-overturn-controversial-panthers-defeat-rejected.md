Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leeds Rhinos lost in overtime against Birmingham Panthers

Leeds Rhinos' request to overturn their controversial defeat by Birmingham Panthers has been rejected by the Netball Super League (NSL).

Panthers won 71-69 after extra time at Worcester Arena, but Rhinos say they should have won in regulation time because a shot they believed was worth two points was only credited as one.

Replays appeared to back up Rhinos' claims, but there is no video technology available to the match officials during games and the regulations do not allow the league to amend the outcome of a match.

The NSL held a review into the incident following a Rhinos appeal, but concluded there was nothing they could do.

"The NSL regulations do not permit the competition committee to change or amend the outcome of a match following an umpire's on court decision in respect of the World Netball Rules of Netball," it said in a statement. 

"So the decision made by the umpires is considered to be final. As a consequence, the result stands."

The NSL says it is working with umpires and officials to try to ensure a similar incident does not happen again.

Joyce Mvula appeared to score a two-point super shot in the final minute of the game, which would have put Leeds on level terms.

Rhinos then scored a one-pointer at the death, believing it meant they had won.

However, the visitors then discovered they had been credited with only one point for the earlier shot they were convinced was worth two.

The super shot was introduced to the league this season, allowing shooters to score two-pointers from a marked-out area during the final five minutes of each quarter.

The one-point decision meant the game was tied at 59-59 to the dismay of Leeds players, who were visibly shocked and slipped to defeat in extra time.

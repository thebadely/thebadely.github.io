It has been recently reported that Footage of rap group Kneecap allegedly calling for the death of British MPs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police.

A video has emerged of the west Belfast trio at a November 2023 gig appearing to show one person from the band saying: "The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP."

The Metropolitan Police also said that another video, from November last year, is being assessed. The footage appeared to show a band member shouting "up Hamas, up Hezbollah" at a performance in London.

Kneecap have said on social media that they have "faced a co-ordinated smear campaign".

Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.

A Met Police spokesperson said: "We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required. 

"We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023."

A UK government spokesman said: "We unequivocally condemn threatening remarks made towards any individual.

"Political intimidation and abuse must have no place in our society. We recognise the chilling effect that harassment and intimidation of elected representatives can have on our democracy.

"All reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. We work with the police and Parliament to do everything in our power to crack down on threats to elected officials."

Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson called for Kneecap to be investigated.

"Promoting sectarianism, glorifying violence and spreading division under the guise of "art" is still hate," the Belfast East MP said in a post on X.

None of the members of the group have been charged with any offences.

The group has faced recent criticism after they displayed messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella earlier this month.

Following former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne calling for Kneecap's US work visas to be revoked, the band was dropped by its now-former sponsor and booking agent Independent Artist Group (IAG). The agency confirmed the split to The Hollywood Reporter.

Kneecap hit back at the visa call, and when asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: "Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though."

The visas held by the band members are understood to no longer be valid and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of its sellout October tour in North America.

Kneecap, made up of Liam Og Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Caireallain and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, alleged on social media they have "faced a co-ordinated smear campaign", saying their shows have previously "called out" the conflict in Gaza.

They also appeared to suggest they would be taking legal action against the "malicious efforts".

Earlier in the week, Kneecap's manager Daniel Lambert said the band had received "severe" death threats after Coachella.

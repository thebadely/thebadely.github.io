According to new developments, In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko analyses Emma Raducanu's return to British number one.

The battle to be the British women's number one is an intriguing sub-plot which will continue over the grass-court season.

Emma Raducanu replaced Katie Boulter as the nation's leading player following her run to the Queen's quarter-finals.

Raducanu has climbed one place to 36th in the world, with Boulter dropping five places to 39th after losing in the second round.

And it's not only Raducanu and Boulter in the mix. British number three Sonay Kartal is ranked just below them at 50th.

"It's nice [being British number one], but I wouldn't say it's the most important thing for me," said Raducanu, whose first spell came after she won the 2021 US Open.

"It was nice for me to have something to chase, and I'm sure Katie's going to enjoy that with me. 

"The grass season is still young, and so is the rest of the season. We have a healthy competition."

Boulter, 28, had a two-year grip on the position but was leapfrogged by 22-year-old Raducanu when the rankings were released on Monday.

While both players insist it is not a huge deal - their focus remains on the bigger picture of climbing the world rankings - it is a storyline which will rumble into Wimbledon at the end of the month.

For Raducanu, though, it does represent a notable landmark as she continues to steadily rebuild her career.

She dropped outside of the world's top 300 after wrist and ankle injuries meant she missed most of the 2023 season and she was ranked as low as 165th this time last year.

Pulling out of this week's WTA tournament in Berlin with an ongoing back issue means she has missed the opportunity to force her way into the Wimbledon seedings.

But, with an improved serve and the ability to get low on the grass, Raducanu will still fancy her chances of replicating her run to the Wimbledon fourth round last year.

"I think maybe my goals have slightly shifted from being seeded to actually improving my game," said Raducanu, whose recent one-sided defeats by Grand Slam champions Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff were reminders of how she remains behind the very best.

"I'd rather have a more competitive match, even if that means losing first round or second round."

It is one of the most remarkable title wins in WTA history. Veteran German qualifier Tatjana Maria came into Queen's having lost her previous eight tour-level matches - and left it as the champion.

Maria's success made her the first women's champion at Queen's since 1973 and, by all measures, the WTA event delivered.

Carlos Alcaraz's post-French Open trip to Ibiza is becoming an annual ritual. The 22-year-old says last week's jaunt was "more chill" than previous ones - although he admit to having a "few shots". 

American Taylor Fritz has made the biggest move in the ATP rankings over the past week, climbing to fourth in the world after winning the Stuttgart title vacated by Jack Draper.

Fritz has jumped back above Draper and Novak Djokovic, putting himself in pole position to be seeded fourth for Wimbledon.

That is important because it means avoiding a potential match against any of the top three seeds - Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev - until the semi-finals.

Canada's Gabriel Diallo has moved to a career-high 44th after winning s'Hertogenbosch, with beaten finalist Zizou Bergs of Belgium and semi-finalist Reilly Opelka also notable climbers in the top 100.

Maria's stunning success means she is, unsurprisingly, the biggest climber in the WTA Tour this week.

The 37-year-old, who became the oldest WTA champion since Serena Williams in 2020, moved up 43 places to 43rd in the world. 

Runner-up Amanda Anisimova and semi-finalist Zheng Qinwen have both achieved new career-high rankings - 13th and fourth respectively - but former number one Iga Swiatek has dropped further to eighth after not playing this week.

Meanwhile, 17-year-old American Iva Jovic cracked the top 100 for the first time after winning the WTA 125 title in Ilkley.

The British grass-court season continues at Queen's, with the men taking over the iconic west London venue for the ATP 500 event.

Alcaraz and Draper headline the tournament, while Sinner, Zverev and former world number one Daniil Medvedev lead a quality field in Halle.

On the WTA Tour, nine of the world's top 10 are among a stacked entry list in Berlin - with only Swiatek missing.

While the next generation take up most of the headlines these days, two British stalwarts have reminded everyone they are still able to compete at the top level.

Former British number one Heather Watson, 33, has moved back into the world's top 150 after reaching the Queen's second round as a qualifier.

And Dan Evans, 35, is back inside the top 200 after doing the same in s'Hertogenbosch last week.

Evans believes he can become a top-100 player again and justified that with a stunning win over world number 13 Frances Tiafoe at Queen's on Monday.

In the men's doubles, British pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool continued their impressive progress by reaching a fifth ATP final of the season.

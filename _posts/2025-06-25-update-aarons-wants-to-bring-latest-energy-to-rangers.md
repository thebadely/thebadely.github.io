According to new developments, Max Aarons follows Lyall Cameron in joining Rangers this summer

Defender Max Aarons hopes to "bring a new energy" after joining Rangers on loan from Bournemouth for the 2025-26 season.

The 25-year-old right-back has become Russell Martin's first signing at Ibrox despite reported interest from the Premier League and Championship.

Aarons, who played for England at under-21 level, will challenge Rangers captain James Tavernier for a starting place in the absence of the injured Dujon Sterling.

"I can't wait to get going," said the Londoner, who spent the latter part of last season in La Liga with Valencia. 

"I've got a lot of experience in different leagues and I have played a lot of games. 

"I think I can bring that experience, I can bring a new energy, and I think Rangers fans can be excited - I am really looking forward to it."

Aarons joined Bournemouth from Norwich City in 2023 in a deal reported to be worth Â£7m, and ended last season on a six-month loan to Valencia.

He made four appearances for the side who finished 12th in La Liga and the Spanish club decided against taking up an option to buy.

Bournemouth rejected a Â£6m offer from Southampton for the defender when new Rangers head coach Martin was head coach at St Mary's last July.

By then, Aarons had made 23 appearances - 15 of them starts - in his first season with Bournemouth. But last season he played only four times - two from the bench.

"Max is a player who I have always kept a keen eye on since he was emerging while I was coming to the end of my time at Norwich as a player," Martin said.

"He is a wonderfully talented player who is hungry to develop, improve and help deliver success for his side. I believe he will be a fantastic addition to the squad."

Having played just 338 minutes with Bournemouth and Valencia last term, Aarons will be hoping for more game time at Rangers.

The 25-year-old has primarily played as a right-back throughout his career but has also filled in on the left of defence at times.

After moving from Norwich to Bournemouth for a reported Â£7m two summers ago, Aarons went on play 20 times in the 2023-24 Premier League, starting 13 times.

His minutes were limited by injury, but the defender still ranked well across a number of categories when compared to fellow full-backs in England's top flight on a per-90 basis.

In the 2023-24 season, according to FotMob, external, Aarons ranked high for successful dribbles and fouls won, while his recoveries, tackle success and duel success were also positive.

However, the Englishman was at the lower end for aerial duel success, touches and pass accuracy.

How does that compare James Tavernier, the man Aarons is likely to be competing with for the right-back spot?

Of course, the differences between playing for Rangers in the Scottish Premiership and playing for Bournemouth in the Premier League have to be taken into consideration.

And that will play a part in Tavernier vastly outperforming Aarons' 2023-24 numbers when it comes to on-the-ball work, including chance creation.

On the defensive side, Aarons comes out on top for successful tackles and possession won in the final third, but the Rangers captain ranks higher for blocks, clearances and interceptions.

Rangers fans, what do you think of the signing of Aarons?

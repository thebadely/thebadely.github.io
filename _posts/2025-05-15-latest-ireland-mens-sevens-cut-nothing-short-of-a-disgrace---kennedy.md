Experts revealed that Kennedy won the World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year in 2022

Former World Rugby sevens player of the year Terry Kennedy says the decision to cut the Ireland men's sevens team at the end of the 2024-25 season is "nothing short of a disgrace".

On Wednesday, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) confirmed the cessation of the men's sevens programme as "part of a broader strategic effort to ensure long-term financial sustainability".

In November, the IRFU's financial results showed an 18m euro (Â£15.1m) deficit for the 2023-24 season.

Kennedy, who competed in the Tokyo and Paris Olympics men's sevens, was critical of the IRFU's decision.

"Absolutely shocking from the IRFU. The way they've handled the whole situation is nothing sort of a disgrace," he said in a statement on social media.

"So disappointed the current group of players as well as the younger players coming through won't be afforded the same opportunities that myself and the lads have because of the short-sightedness of a couple of old guys running the game here."

Players' union 'immensely disappointed' as Ireland men's sevens cut

Kennedy opted to take a break from sevens after Ireland's quarter-final exit against Fiji at Paris 2024.

He missed what proved to be the men's sevens' last tournament in Los Angeles earlier this month, when they finished 11th and suffered relegation in the World SVNS Series.

"The financial/cost-cutting excuse is complete smoke and mirrors, masquerading the fact that every Rugby World Cup year unions run at a major loss due to a lack of November match revenue," continued the statement from the wing, who won the World Rugby award in 2022.

"Between funding from World Rugby for being on the World Series, Sport Ireland funding from Olympic success and sponsorship funding, no other programme outside the men's 15s brings in anywhere near the revenue."

Kennedy was also critical of the money being spent by the likes of Leinster on short-term contracts in the men's 15-a-side game.

Leinster brought in New Zealand international Jordie Barrett this season and are set to add international team-mate Rieko Ioane after the November internationals.

"No mention of the millions paid to bring foreign players over on short-term contracts and the budget to pay for committee members travelling to Six Nations games and tours with lunches and dinners â far more than the whole 7s budget," Kennedy added.

"The disrespect that the IRFU have shown to Sport Ireland and the Irish Olympic Committee after all their years of funding, utterly disgraceful."

It has been recently reported that Inflation in Guernsey slowed to 3.9% between March and June, according to latest figures from the States of Guernsey.

The rate of inflation, measured by the Retail Price Index (RPI), is 1.4% lower than the same time last year and 0.3% lower than March 2025. The States said inflation was being driven by increases in the cost of housing and tobacco. 

Guernsey saw a peak in December 2022, at 8.5%.

Officials at Guernsey's States have predicted inflation rates will remain stable in the next three months, before sharply decreasing. 

Guernsey's inflation rate in April was 4.2%. 

Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time.

For example, if a litre of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.

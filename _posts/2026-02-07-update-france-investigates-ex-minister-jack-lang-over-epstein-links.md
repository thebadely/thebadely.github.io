Let's dive into the details: Financial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.

Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected "laundering of tax fraud proceeds". 

It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.

Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as "baseless". 

He told AFP the investigation "will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour".

Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.

In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. 

The former French minister, who is named almost 700 times in the Epstein files, had until now resisted pressure to step down.

Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. 

Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.

On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him "some 15 years ago". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.

Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.

He said he had found Epstein "passionate about art, culture and cinema".

In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been "generous" and "courteous", adding: "When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record."

Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.

Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to "invest in young French and international artists".

She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.

An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been "incredibly naive".

Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: "I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union."

The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.

The latest release of Epstein files by the US government - which include millions  of documents - include the names of rich and powerful people from around the world. Being mentioned does not imply wrongdoing.

Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

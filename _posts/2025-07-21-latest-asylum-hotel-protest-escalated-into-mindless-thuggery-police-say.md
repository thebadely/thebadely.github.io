Let's dive into the details: Six people have been arrested during the latest protest outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Essex.

Bottles and smoke flares were thrown towards police vehicles during the demonstration which saw more than 1,000 people gathered at the site of the Bell Hotel in Epping.

Ch Supt Simon Anslow said it was disappointing to see the protest escalate into "mindless thuggery". 

The disorder followed the arrest and charge of an asylum seeker last week on suspicion of alleged sexual assaults in the town.

"Our cells, which have been filling up throughout the evening, are ready for you," Ch Supt Anslow  warned in a statement. 

"I think I speak for all of us – including the people of Epping – when I say we've had enough of your criminality," he added.

Police put in place a Section 35 dispersal order to "prevent further crime or anti-social behaviour" overnight.

Demonstrators on Sunday chanted "send them home" and "save our kids", as projectiles were thrown towards police vans blocking the entrance to the hotel.  

Many had travelled from across the UK, with one woman from Scotland telling the BBC she felt compelled to "support local people and get the asylum seekers out".

Police also surrounded a counter-protester, an elderly woman, before escorting her out of the area as masked protesters followed her and shouted abuse.

Unrest at the site on Thursday led to three arrests after eight police officers were injured.

Plans for Sunday's protest prompted Essex Police to announce a section 60AA order requiring the removal of face coverings until 04:00 on Monday.

One man was earlier charged with violent disorder and criminal damage following previous clashes outside the hotel.

A spokesperson for the force added: "We will deal robustly and quickly with anyone intent on coming into Epping to commit selfish criminal behaviour.

"The right to peaceful protest is protected by law and allows everyone freedom of expression, but this must be done respectfully and if there is a risk to public order we will act appropriately."

The order is in place around Epping including its tube station.

Thursday's demonstration was one of a series of protests outside the hotel since 38-year-old asylum seeker Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was charged with sexual assault - after an incident where he is alleged to have attempted to kiss a 14-year-old girl.

He denied the charge when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Thursday.

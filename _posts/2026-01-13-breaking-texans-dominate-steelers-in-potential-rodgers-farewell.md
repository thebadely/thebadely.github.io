Experts revealed that Pittsburgh's brutal defeat to Houston could have been Aaron Rodgers' final game in the NFL

The Houston Texans produced a defensive masterclass to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 and book the final spot in the Divisional Round of the NFL play-offs.

The final Wildcard Weekend game on Monday was expected to be a low-scoring affair and so it proved for three quarters, with Houston leading 7-6.

Then the Texans charged clear with three touchdowns in the final quarter - two of them scored by their league-leading defence.

That made for a dismal end for Pittsburgh quarterback Aaron Rodgers in what could be the last game in the 42-year-old's illustrious career. 

After joining the Steelers on a one-year deal, the NFL's four-time Most Valuable Player has said this could be his final season.

And Pittsburgh are now out of the play-offs while Houston, the fifth seed in the AFC, will visit the New England Patriots next Sunday on the back of a 10-game winning streak.

NFL Play-Offs: Texans dominate Steelers - is that the end for Aaron Rodgers?

Houston's pass rush has wreaked havoc this season, helping the Texans to a 12-5 record and a third straight play-off appearance.

And they gave Rodgers a torrid time on his 23rd play-off appearance and first in four years.

The one-time Super Bowl winner failed to get the Steelers offence going, although their defence also made life difficult for Houston quarterback CJ Stroud.

They forced the game's first three turnovers - two from Stroud fumbles, plus an interception - but the best Pittsburgh could muster on the following possessions was a solitary field goal.

That made the half-time score 7-6, with Christian Kirk having scored a touchdown for Houston, before their defensive pressure paid off in the final quarter.

Rodgers fumbled after being sacked by Will Anderson and Sheldon Rankins recovered the loose ball to score a 33-yard touchdown.

Woody Marks then got into the end zone with a 13-yard rush and four plays later Rodgers was intercepted by Calen Bullock, who returned it for a 50-yard touchdown.

Aaron Rodgers was sacked four times and restricted to 146 passing yards

Rodgers holds the best passer rating (102.2) and interception rate (1.4%) of all-time  so to finish with a pick-six and a passer rating of 50.8 would be far from a fitting farewell.

The Steelers are believed to be open to welcoming Rodgers back for what would be a 22nd NFL season, but speaking after Monday's game, he said he would now "get away and have the right kind of conversations".

"I'm not going to be making any emotional decisions," Rodgers added. "It's been a fun year so it's disappointing to be sitting here with the season over."

While Houston's first play-off win on the road has boosted their hopes of reaching their first Super Bowl, Rodgers will contemplate ending his career with just one appearance in the NFL's championship game.

That came in 2011, when Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to victory over Pittsburgh, but he and the Steelers have yet to get back to the Super Bowl.

Pittsburgh's head coach Mike Tomlin could also be set for a change as the Steelers have now lost their past seven play-off games and it is nine years since their last post-season victory.

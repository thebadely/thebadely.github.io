Let's dive into the details: Stars including Addison Rae and Sabrina Carpenter hit the red carpet at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday.

Here are some of the most eye-catching looks from on the red carpet and inside the premiere ceremony before the main show.

Sabrina Carpenter's Grammy-nominated album may be called Man's Best Friend, but her red carpet look seemed to channel another blonde bombshell, with her form-fitting crystal and diamond gown reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.

Maybe diamonds are a girl's best friend? Carpenter is also performing at the 2026 awards ceremony.

Chappell Roan's rust coloured gown hid a revealing outfit that is sure to be one of the most talked-about dresses of this year's ceremony.

Lady Gaga, who is nominated for album of the year, returned to the feathered look she debuted at last year's ceremony.

Bad Bunny went for a classic tux and bow tie. He's nominated for six prizes, including album of the year, ahead of his performance at the Super Bowl next week.

Supermodel Heidi Klum is surely used to making even the most form-fitting designs work on the runway, and her look for the 2026 Grammy awards red carpet was no different. 

Her flesh-toned dress earned plenty of stares as Klum struggled to walk past the photographers. But she never stopped smiling on the journey.

Rapper Killer Mike, who is nominated for best contemporary Christian music performance/song for his song Headphones, walked the red carpet with his wife, Shana Render.

Even if he doesn't win, Render won the red carpet trend report as she's one of many performers and guests who got the memo to wear gold.

Venezuelan artist Raniero Palm, who is nominated for best classical instrumental solo for Hope Orchestrated, made a not-so-subtle political statement when he walked the red carpet with his country's flag.

Best new artist nominee Addison Rae brought new meaning to her song High Fashion on the red carpet. She paired her fitted white Alaïa-designed dress with very, very high stilettos.

Justin Bieber posed with his wife Hailey - both dressed in black - ahead of his Grammys comeback performance.

Pharrell Williams was an early winner on the night, bagging best rap performance for his feature on Clipse and Kendrick Lamar's Chains & Whips.

As men's creative director for Louis Vuitton he probably got a discount on this pink velour suit too.

Olivia Dean is one of the UK's big hopes on the night in LA, aiming to become the first Brit to win best new artist since Dua Lipa in 2019.

She's already in the running for best dressed.

Fellow Brit Yungblud gave Sharon Osborne a big hug on the red carpet ahead of his performance in tribute to the late Black Sabbath star.

K-Pop idol Rosé pictured on the red carpet shortly before kicking off the ceremony with an explosive performance alongside Bruno Mars.

Katseye caught the eye on the red carpet too.

The girl group were nominated for both best new artist and best pop duo/group performance for their track Gabriela.

Another Brit abroad, Lola Young performed her hit Messy but looked pretty smart in a shirt and tie under a baggy outfit.

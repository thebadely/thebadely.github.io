According to new developments, Munster's Dan Kelly scored the only try of a tight first half after a break by Mike Haley

Investec Champions Cup Pool Two

Munster: (7) 31

Tries: Kelly, Haley, Quinn, Farrell, Beirne Cons: Crowley 3 

Gloucester (3) 3

Pens: Barton

Munster got their Investec Champions Cup campaign back on track with a dominant bonus-point win over a stubborn Gloucester.

After a heavy defeat by Bath in their opening game, Munster kept their composure in a tight first half before pulling away in the second as the amount of defensive work Gloucester were forced into took its toll.

Dan Kelly scored the only try of the first period in which Gloucester prop Jamal Ford-Robinson was yellow-carded for a dangerous clearout on Jack Crowley.

Mike Haley added Munster's second after 49 minutes but it was only when Gloucester's Caio James was sent to the sin-bin with 13 minutes left that the floodgates opened and Ruadhan Quinn, Tom Farrell and Tadhg Beirne all took advantage to seal a deserved win.

Gloucester came into the game on a run of four consecutive wins including last week's Champions Cup success over Castres, and George Barton's third-minute penalty gave them the lead as they frustrated Munster with a stout defensive display in the opening 20 minutes.

But the hosts continued to apply the pressure and after Niall Scannell had gone close, full-back Haley made a break before offloading to the supporting Kelly who was tackled short of the line but was able to reach out to score.

Gloucester went down to 14 men after 32 minutes when prop Ford-Robinson was sin-binned for his ill-judged attempt to remove Crowley from the breakdown.

Crowley dusted himself off to take the penalty but missed the target from about 35 metres.

Munster pushed hard for a second try to extend their advantage before the break but after several phases near the line they were held up on the stroke of half-time as Gloucester's defence again proved its worth.

But the hosts were bossing possession and territory and made it count early in the second period when a brilliant one-handed offload from centre Alex Nankivell found Haley who raced over.

The hosts maintained their momentum but struggled to put the stubborn Cherry and Whites away until the visitors were again reduced to 14 when James was yellow-carded for killing the ball as Munster attacked near the line with the score at 12-3 after 67 minutes.

That was the moment Gloucester's impressive resolve crumbled and a quick tap penalty immediately paid dividends as Quinn muscled his way over for Munster's third try.

There was still time for more Nankivell magic as his deft offload to Farrell secured the bonus point after 72 minutes, and captain Beirne also crossed as Munster scored three tries in eight minutes to put some gloss on the scoreline.

Gloucester have three Prem matches before returning to Champions Cup action on 9 January with a trip to Edinburgh, followed by a home game against Toulon a week later.

Munster travel to Toulon in their next European game on 11 January, before rounding off the pool stage with a home tie against Castres.

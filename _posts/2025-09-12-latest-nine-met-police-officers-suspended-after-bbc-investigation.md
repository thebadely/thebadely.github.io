According to new developments, The Metropolitan Police has suspended nine officers and referred itself to the police watchdog following a BBC investigation into Charing Cross police station.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was investigating the behaviour of 11 current or former Met officers and one staff member based at the central London station.

The accusations, which feature in a forthcoming BBC Panorama documentary, include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, the police watchdog said.

The BBC contacted the Met this week for a response to the documentary's findings.

The allegations - which relate to the conduct of nine Met officers, a former Met officer and a serving designated detention officer - are said to have taken place both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.

The officers range in rank from police constable to sergeant.

The Met said it had suspended nine officers and removed another two from frontline duties. 

The IOPC said it had received a referral from another force relating to the conduct of the former Met officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and has since transferred.

"These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station," IOPC director Amanda Rowe said.

Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist described the alleged behaviour as "disgraceful". 

He added that the Met was taking "immediate steps to dismantle the current custody team at this station, significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster leadership team".

"In addition, we are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by Professional Standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings," Mr Twist said. 

The IOPC in 2022 found "disgraceful" behaviour in the ranks at the same police station, including a homophobic, racist and misogynistic Whatsapp group.

The Charing Cross report was part of a string of damaging scandals to hit the force that led former Met Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to announce she was stepping down from her role in February 2022.

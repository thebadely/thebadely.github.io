It has been recently reported that I was in the room when President Donald Trump entered and it's fair to say he got a good welcome from the crowd, certainly at the beginning. A standing ovation.

On top of that, there was an astonishing scrum to try to get in, with many turned away - even heads of state.

The security was unbelievable, not letting even some of the most famous attendees in or out of the hall.

Minutes into the speech, Trump was keeping his cool - even dropping in phrases about wanting the UK "to do great".

What some thought would be the day on which the US president laid down the laws of his new global economy was filled more with grandfatherly advice.

It was far from the mildly menacing tone of his social media posts claiming that Greenland will be America's.

But which one is the real Donald Trump? Has he heard how badly some of his rhetoric has gone down?

As I entered, I was told of an astonishing event last night where Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the audience that, in terms of Europe's economy, "you're dead".

There was a walkout. Might there have been one today? He seemed to be trying to avoid that.

At first, I thought Trump was trying on a diplomatic front, perhaps having heard some of the significant criticism levelled against him and trying to sound mellow.

He talked in friendly terms about the western allies that had been most perturbed by his social media posts.

He even acknowledged that he probably shouldn't speak about the controversial issue of Greenland - which he has repeatedly vowed to take over.

But, almost as though he could not help it, the speech seemed to take a dark turn.

First he described America's role helping Greenland in the past, including being friendly to Denmark.

But he then insulted Europe's biggest economy, saying everyone in the hall "would be speaking German" if it wasn't for the US. 

And then it came. He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland.

A negotiated settlement, he said. No force required. But the US needed "full title".

"We want this land" to build the "greatest Golden Dome ever built", he said.

And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada.

"I'm asking for a piece of ice... it's a very small ask."

It was incredible to see this said out loud.

There was high security, high stakes and high tension in the Alps for the arrival of the would-be sheriff of the world, brandishing his new rules.

The reaction in the room ranged.

The president's attempts at charm seemed to win him polite applause. But as he went from rigged elections to his annoyance at other leaders' Davos speeches, some sat in disbelief.

Even though he promised not to invade Greenland, many were stunned by his attempts to persuade Europe to hand over the territory.

Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California said the speech was "TACO" Tuesday, a reference to the "Trump always chickens out" catchphrase used to mock the president.

He argued Trump had backed down after robust pushback from leaders Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney.

A key Republican senator, Thomas Tillis, said the president's pursuit of Greenland, even a negotiated annexation, would not have the backing of Congress.

So while Trump attempted to dial down tensions, he still criticised allies - including personal attacks on leaders.

And while he promised not to invade Greenland, he still said it will be part of the new America - and that the world should thank him for it.

The speech may have eventually come to an end, but we will be talking about it for a long time to come.

England's Alice Hewson retained her Swiss Open title with a convincing five-shot victory at Golfpark Holzhausern.

The 28-year-old led by two strokes heading into the third and final round, where she carded a four-under 67 to seal her third Ladies European Tour title, finishing 13 under overall.

Ireland's Lauren Walsh, Switzerland's Chiara Tamburlini and Sweden's Kajsa Arwefjall finished in a tie for second on eight under.

"It's an absolute dream come true," Hewson told LET.com.

She completed her final round in style, concluding with three consecutive birdies, having made two earlier in the round and one bogey.

Hewson ended a four-year title drought by winning last year's Swiss Open in a play-off.

"I wanted to put in a good effort for the title defence so to come away winning again, I couldn't ask for anymore," she added.

"I've had quite a few top 10s in the last few weeks, so to come in here and get the job done, it's good."

England's Amy Taylor and Ireland's Sara Byrne shared fifth place on seven under.

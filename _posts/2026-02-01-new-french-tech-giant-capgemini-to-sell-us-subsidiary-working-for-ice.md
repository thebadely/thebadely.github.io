Experts revealed that French technology giant Capgemini has announced it will sell its US subsidiary after its work locating people for immigration enforcement agency ICE sparked outrage.

Capgemini has come under pressure from French lawmakers over a contract its subsidiary signed with ICE, amid international scrutiny over the methods used by the agency's agents in Minnesota.

The fatal shooting of US citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis have sparked protests across the US and led to increased scrutiny of the agency.

Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since 18 December to provide "skip tracing services for enforcement and removal operations", public records show.

Skip tracing services locate individuals whose whereabouts are unknown. 

Capgemini Government Solutions is set to be paid more than $4.8m (£3.5m) for its work tracing people for ICE, which is due to continue until 15 March, US government listings show. It is one of 13 contracts the subsidiary holds with ICE.

Capgemini, one of the largest listed companies in France, said in a statement that it had not been able "to exercise appropriate control over certain aspects of this subsidiary's operations in order to ensure alignment with the Group's objectives".

It added that "the divestiture process of this business will be initiated immediately".

Criticism of ICE practices has intensified in recent weeks since the shooting of 37-year-old Pretti, the second fatal shooting of a US citizen since immigration agents began surging several cities across the US, acting on the Trump administration's drive to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.

The killing of Pretti involved Border Patrol, an immigration agency which works alongside ICE, while Good was shot by an ICE agent.

ICE has detained thousands since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pledge to increase deportations. ICE enforcement actions have regularly occurred in public places, leading to a number of clashes with protesters.

Last week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that "we were recently made aware, through public sources, of the nature of a contract awarded to Capgemini Government Solutions by DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement in December 2025". 

"The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm," he said.

The revelation provoked outrage amongst French politicians.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure called for the company "to be transparent" about the contracts it has with ICE.

Meanwhile, left-wing opposition MP Hadrien Clouet called for sanctions to be imposed on French firms working with ICE, commenting: "French private companies are collaborating with ICE. We do not accept this."

Capgemini was founded in 1967 and currently functions as an IT services and consulting firm. It currently has more than 340,000 employees worldwide and is valued at €22bn (£19bn).

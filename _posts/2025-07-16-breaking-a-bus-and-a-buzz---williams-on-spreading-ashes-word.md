According to new developments, In his BBC Sport column, England captain George Williams spreads the word about the autumn Ashes series and gives insight into the recent squad get-together.

Just 100 days are left until this England side gets the chance to taste an Ashes series again and we face Australia for the first time since 2017.

Me and Jack Welsby went down to London on Wednesday, driving round the city on a red bus and visiting some tourist sites for photos and filming.

We're trying to grow the buzz, to get people talking about the series down there and get involved.

As players, you want to be involved in the biggest of games, and I don't see many bigger - if any.

Even though there is still a lot of rugby to be played in Super League, to play against Australia at the end of the year is the pinnacle.

I actually don't mind doing the press and promotion. I try to do it with a smile on my face and enjoy it, because it doesn't last forever and I'll soon be retired.

So I've got to enjoy being in the media, growing the game and being England captain, which is something I'm really proud of.

Wane wants higher Super League intensity to prepare England for Ashes

We need some Ashes glory in colour, says England's Wane

Australia to tour England for first time since 2003

We had a meeting as an England group at a hotel near Manchester recently. I really enjoy the England camps. Any time we can get together is good. There were a couple of new faces in there as well, a reward for players that are doing well.

It's nice to meet the new lads but also to catch up with the connections you've made over the past few years - I've got some good friends from other teams that you don't see too often unless you play against them.

The main purpose of the meeting was for Shaun to get his message across to us all, and point out a few things. It was very Shaun Wane-esque in that mind, the way he delivered it.

Weirdly, I'm used to it because I've had him as a coach for a very long time, from my Wigan days and now as England coach. He even says in the meetings that a lot of us will have heard this before - but he knows what he wants from his players.

He doesn't go away from that. He knows what works. He's been very successful for a reason. 

So there were some home truths. Some of the lads already know what they need to do better but it's not nice to see it there in the room; people missing tackles or doing things he doesn't value within a team.

England head coach Shaun Wane is renowned for honesty in his messages to players around standards

It's not personal. He's not having a go at the individual. It's the bigger picture. He is showing us what is not acceptable - and if we continue to do those things, we won't be in the team.

It's a tough school. To represent England, you've got to be at your best and that goes for all of us. Whether you're first time in or one of the seniors, there are certain standards you have to reach and he won't go away from them, so everyone knows what he expects.

There are no grey areas. Sometimes you won't like what he's saying but you know where you stand.

I definitely value it. It's something I took away from playing for Shaun - driving up standards.

From the Australia side there has been a few things mentioned about what they will do now Mal Meninga has stepped down, but we saw what they could be capable of in State of Origin.

I always watch Origin. It's a massive part of the game down in Australia. And a lot of those players will transfer to the Australia team.

As much as I do enjoy watching it, it's a little bit of homework as well.

I'm sure they'll find someone to fill the coach role. They're the best - and have been a long time - so we're expecting the best of them.

They're the number one and we're looking forward to challenging ourselves against them. We're looking to win - there's no doubt about it.

George Williams' NRL spell was cut short when he left Canberra in 2021 to return to England for family reasons

Right now there's a lot of negotiating going on and logistics surrounding my future beyond 2025, so I'm leaving it up to my agent.

I've had some great, respectful conversations with Warrington - everything's above board and there are no bad feelings between anyone involved.

I'd be stupid not to listen to a great opportunity from the Australian NRL and I think the club understand that. I've stressed to them it's not the case that I hate it here and I'm wanting out - but some things arise in life and I'd hate to have any regrets.

We'll have some good, honest conversations and see what will happen.

Warrington snatch victory over Catalans with late try

We've won three in a row at Warrington now and given ourselves a chance to get back into the Super League's top six.

The win over Catalans down in Perpignan was a tough one, and the weather was mad. First of all we were happy to get in and out of there with a win, but it was 30C and cracking the flags on the Thursday and Friday we were there - and then come game day on the Saturday, it decided to have a storm for five or six hours. It wasn't ideal.

It was hot, muggy and the ball was slippy as anything. We didn't play well either, but I'd rather play rubbish and win than play well and lose.

We've had a rollercoaster of a year. We've lacked consistency but now we've a great chance to keep our season alive. Get in the six, and it's anybody's game.

If we beat Castleford at the weekend, it's four from four. We have to go into work with a smile on our face and work hard. Feeling sad won't do anything. We want to be better.

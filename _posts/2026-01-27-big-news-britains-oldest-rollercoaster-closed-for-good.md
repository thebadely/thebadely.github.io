According to new developments, A 100-year-old rollercoaster, believed to be the oldest in Britain, has closed for good.

Dreamland Margate in Kent announced on Tuesday that the amusement park's Scenic Railway would "take well-earned retirement from operation as a ride".

A restoration of the Grade II* listed rollercoaster was completed in 2015 after it had closed in 2005 and suffered an arson attack in 2008.

"Dreamland is committed to finding a new long-term plan to reinvent the Scenic Railway and for it to be enjoyed by future generations in a fresh way," a spokesperson said.

The theme park said an "extensive process of consultations and inspections" were carried out but it was "concluded that, after 100+ years, the ride has come to the end of its current life".

The decision was taken "in close consultation" with The National Lottery Heritage Fund, Historic England and Thanet District Council, the spokesperson said.

The Scenic Railway, one of the theme park's star attractions, has been out of action since a fault in 2024.

Dreamland said it would host a pop-up exhibition on the ride's history later in 2026 and the rollercoaster would "be re-invented for people to enjoy in a different way".

The wooden ride first opened in 1920 and, according to Historic England, suffered fires in 1949 and 1957.

Its 2015 restoration was part of an £18m investment in reopening the park, which had spent a decade closed to the public.

Dreamland posted surveys on its social media soliciting suggestions for repurposing the ride and requesting memories of the attraction.

"If you are a creative thinker with a practical approach, or a dreamer with a thoughtful and achievable vision, we would love to hear from you," the park said.

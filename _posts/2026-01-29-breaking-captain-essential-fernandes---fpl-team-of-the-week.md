According to new developments, They've just beaten the best and second-best teams in the league, scoring five goals in the process?

Is it time to jump on Manchester United assets?

There are plenty to choose from and two make this team of the week for gameweek 24.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Is Haaland's time up?

Deciding not to captain Erling Haaland was the right call, as he got one point from the bench.

Putting the armband on Igor Thiago did not pay off however, as he only scored two points!

Harry Wilson (10 points), Antoine Semenyo (8) and Thierno Barry (9) were star performers in a pleasing 49-point week.

Robert Sanchez, Chelsea, keeper, Â£4.9m - West Ham (h)

Sorry Hammers fans, but I'm backing a clean sheet against your attack again.

Sanchez has nine this season and was two minutes away from his 10th at Crystal Palace last week that would have put him third in the goalkeeper scoring charts, ahead of David Raya.

Chelsea are about to embark on a dreamy run of fixtures, with Wolves away and then home games against Leeds and Burnley next.

Reece James, Chelsea, Â£5.7m - West Ham (h)

The only reason James isn't a season-long FPL choice is his fitness, because he's got a real attacking threat when he starts.

Two goals and five assists this season and, per 90 minutes on the pitch he has created 1.24 chances and 0.35 big chances - the most of any Chelsea defender.

He has been involved in 18% of Chelsea's goals during the time he is on the pitch - not bad for a defender.

Gabriel, Arsenal, Â£6.9m - Leeds (a)

It can be scary going against Gabriel in FPL and, given budget is not much of an issue for most managers at the moment, why risk it?

He's so dangerous at corners that he's always on the verge of a double-digit haul, especially as Arsenal get a clean sheet in almost every other game.

James Hill, Bournemouth, Â£3.9m - Wolves (a)

Five straight starts, defensive contribution points (defcon) in four of those (he got nine points in the other match) and a decent run until week 30.

Hill is the budget option you need if money is an issue.

Bruno Fernandes (captain), Manchester United, Â£9.5m - Fulham (h)

Is Fernandes essential? The answer is yes.

Returns in every game since coming back from injury, back playing at number 10 and, after Fulham this weekend, has a run of four games against teams placed 10th or below.

Despite missing three matches this season, Fernandes has created 20 more chances (64) than any other midfielder.

His 10 assists is a league high and, even in his advance position, he is collecting defensive contribution points too.

Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United, Â£8.3m - Fulham (h)

You can't ignore United's sudden upturn in form, especially how good they look in attack.

Mbeumo is coming off the back of nine-point and 10-point performances and he is just about the next best option in Michael Carrick's attack, especially given he is likely to continue at centre-forward.

But Matheus Cunha (Â£8m) and Amad Diallo (Â£6.2m) are great differentials too, and worth a punt if you are chasing rank.

Enzo Fernandez, Chelsea, Â£6.7m - West Ham (h)

With Cole Palmer a completely unreliable FPL pick at the moment, Fernandez is who you want to go for among Chelsea midfield and forward assets.

His minutes are the most reliable and he's on penalties if Palmer doesn't start.

The Argentine's expected goals (xG) of 8.59 is the highest among midfielders and he's had the third most big chances (11).

Morgan Rogers, Aston Villa, Â£7.7m - Brentford (h)

Take note of Villa's nice run of fixtures. This game is followed by Bournemouth (a), Brighton and Leeds at home then a trip to Wolves.

Rogers ticks away - 12 returns in 23 games - with the potential for a double-digit haul at any moment.

Antoine Semenyo, Manchester City, Â£7.7m - Tottenham (a)

Has scored in three of his four City appearances in all competitions and he could have had a double last week against Wolves.

It's hard to make a case not to pick Semenyo, the game's top-scoring midfielder.

With Thomas Frank under major pressure, there's every chance Spurs implode again and City run riot in London.

Brian Brobbey has five goals and an assist in nine starts this season for Sunderland

Erling Haaland, Manchester City, Â£15m - Tottenham (a)

Benching Haaland is one thing, ditching him completely is another. Don't consider it.

It's not like any other strikers are consistently excelling either and Tottenham have been woeful recently.

Brian Brobbey, Sunderland, Â£5.5m - Burnley (h)

Here's an in-form striker, at a budget price with a very tasty fixture.

Three goals in four games for the Dutchman and he will be a popular choice on wildcards this week.

Martin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, Â£4m - Sunderland (a)

Mateus Mane, Wolves, striker, Â£4.5m - Bournemouth (h)

Omar Alderete, Sunderland, defender, Â£4.1m - Burnley (h)

Jan Paul van Hecke, Brighton, defender, Â£4.5m - Everton (h)

Team total cost: Â£98.9m

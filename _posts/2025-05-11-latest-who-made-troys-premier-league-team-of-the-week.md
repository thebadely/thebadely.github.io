Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): A big shoutout to Southampton. I thought they handled the situation really well with their choice of tactics. 

You saw Manchester City complaining but Southampton did what they had to do to avoid that terrible points record of being level with Derby as the worst side in Premier League history.

I thought Ramsdale was good, organised, made saves when he needed to, and all in all was excellent.

Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): One of my favourite players to watch. He gets up and down the field, gets an assist, he can attack really well.

Jan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): Van Hecke has been excellent all season. He's one of those players where you wonder whether Brighton will struggle to keep hold of him in the summer. He's broken into the Dutch national team as well. Again he was cool, calm and collected. He just gives a real solid presence.

Jan Bednarek (Southampton): I'm going to give him credit not just for dealing with Erling Haaland defensively. But he also wound Haaland up - and a few of the other City players, getting them frustrated to get their heads out of the game. 

Southampton have been awful all season, so for them to keep a clean sheet is a massive bonus.

Nathan Collins (Brentford): Collins is one of the unsung heroes. He defends well and is a set-piece threat. An all-round solid individual but you don't really hear much about him. 

He's always a seven out of 10. I want to give him some credit this season. I think he's been excellent again, another breakout year, and you can just see him going from strength to strength.

Vitalii Mykolenko (Everton): He came up with a goal. He's a really underrated player this guy, but under David Moyes, he seems to have found his stride and his patterns. 

A few times under Sean Dyche, you could see an element of nervousness. You don't see that any more. I think he's transformed himself into a really good player. 

All of my midfielders scored but I'm not putting them in for their goals, I'm putting them in for their all-round play. 

Tomas Soucek (West Ham): Sometimes you watch games and guys just stand out on the pitch. Whenever you watch West Ham, Soucek is one of those guys who stands out. 

He has a solid defensive framework. He heads it, kicks it, tackles. Offensively he's a threat as well. He's a really important player for them and they're going to have to think of a way of moving on from him at some point because him and Jarrod Bowen keep stepping up for West Ham.

Sandro Tonali (Newcastle): Tonali has been in this team three or four times already this season. He is an excellent, excellent footballer. There was talk about him being sold earlier on in the season. I can't see how they can sell him, I really can't.

Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace): Eze is just a joke, isn't he? Loads of people in Fantasy Football, like myself, will be really happy with his two goals. 

I think at the start of the year he would've felt he'd get the move like Michael Olise. He didn't get that move and got his head wrapped around it. Now he's just developing into this special, special talent. 

He's taking games over, getting confidence. Also, looking towards the end of this season, there's an opportunity to break into this England team on a consistent basis. I would have Eze in my team over Phil Foden every day of the week. 

Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa): Watkins broke the record for most Villa goals in the Premier League, taking over from Gabby Agbonlahor. 

But he also put in a full shift  for his team, linking up the play well, winning fouls when he had to, and obviously came up with that deft touch to beat Bournemouth and keep alive Villa's hopes of Champions League football.

Danny Welbeck (Brighton): I'm also picking my old team-mate Danny Welbeck. Welbs for the first time got 10 goals in a Premier League season. It's crazy to say that for someone with such an established career as Welbeck. It's great to see him still scoring and healthy.

Simon Rusk and the rest of Southampton's coaching staff: I'm going to go for Southampton's interim manager Simon Rusk, and also the team's whole coaching staff.

The Saints kept a clean sheet against Manchester City. They just stopped them and did all the clever tactics you need to do to knock City off of their stride.

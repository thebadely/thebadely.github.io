Here’s what you need to know: Paddy Pimblett is on a seven-fight winning streak

Paddy Pimblett made weight with ease for his interim UFC lightweight title fight on Saturday in Las Vegas.

The Liverpudlian was the first to the scales at Friday morning's official weigh-in, weighing 154lbs (11st).

Pimblett, 31, said "easy work" before making his way off the stage.

The Briton is the favourite for his contest against Justin Gaethje, who was the last fighter to weigh in.

American Gaethje, 37, tipped the scales at 155lbs (11st 1lb). 

Flyweight Alex Perez and bantamweight Deiveson Figueiredo both missed weight for their respective bouts and forfeited 25% of their purse as a result.

The weigh-in was marred by the collapse of American bantamweight Cameron Smotherman.

The 28-year-old fainted on the stage after making weight for his contest with Ricky Turcios, which has now been cancelled.

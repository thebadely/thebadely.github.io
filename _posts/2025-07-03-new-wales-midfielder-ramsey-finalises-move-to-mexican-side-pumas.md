Let's dive into the details: Aaron Ramsey made his Wales debut against Denmark in 2008

Wales captain Aaron Ramsey has completed his move to Mexican side Club Universidad Nacional, - known as Pumas UNAM.

It is understood Ramsey has joined the Mexico City-based club on a one-year deal and becomes the first high-profile British player to play in the Mexican league.

The 34-year-old  shares the same agent as Pumas manager Efrain Juarez.

Ramsey was appointed Cardiff interim manager for the final three games of the 2024-25 Championship season after the club sacked Omer Riza.

But he was unable to prevent relegation to League One and his departure from the club was confirmed in June.

Ramsey posted on social media that he had left League One-bound Cardiff City with "a lot of different emotions".

"For now I am on a new adventure but I will be keeping a close eye on the club as always and it will forever have my support," he posted.

He has made it clear he wants to continue his playing career and lead Wales at the World Cup next summer.

Ramsey returned to his boyhood club Cardiff in 2023, but injuries have restricted his game time.

Pumas finished sixth in the 2024-25 Mexican standings and qualified for the Concacaf Champions Cup.

Experts revealed that Jarell Quansah has made 14 appearances for England Under-21s

Bayer Leverkusen have signed defender Jarell Quansah from Liverpool in a Â£35m deal.

The 22-year-old centre-back has joined the German Bundesliga club on a five-year contract.

Quansah was part of the England side that won the European Under-21 Championship by beating Germany in the final on Saturday.

His move is the third deal between the clubs this summer after Liverpool signed midfielder Florian Wirtz and defender Jeremie Frimpong.

Newcastle wanted to sign Quansah last summer, as part of a deal to send winger Anthony Gordon to Liverpool, but the Reds turned down the proposal.

As Quansah is a homegrown player, the fee Liverpool received from Leverkusen will be recorded as 'pure' profit with regards to profit and sustainability rules (PSR).

Quansah came through the Liverpool academy and made 58 appearances for the club, scoring three goals.

He helped the Reds win the League Cup in 2024 and made 13 league appearances last season as Arne Slot's side won the Premier League.

"He has already made an impressive impact in a Liverpool defence dominated by world-class players," said Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes.

"With Jarell, our defence gains significant dynamism, pace and toughness in tackling, and he's another very important building block for the future."

Liverpool are interested in Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi, amid uncertainty over Ibrahima Konate's future.

The France centre-back has 12 months left on his contract at Anfield and is yet to agree an extension, while Joe Gomez's future is also unclear.

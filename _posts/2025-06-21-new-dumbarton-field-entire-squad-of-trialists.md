It has been recently reported that Dumbarton joked about fielding a squad of trialists on social media

Scottish League 2 side Dumbarton's pre-season friendlies with Stenhousemuir and Stirling Albion created a stir on social media - because every single player in their squad was a trialist.

After a challenging few months off the pitch for the Sons and players being on holiday, manager Stevie Farrell was forced to bring in different players for a mini-tournament in Stenhousemuir.

"The team news is in," Dumbarton posted on X before kick-off in their first match.

"Trialist between the sticks. Trialist and Trialist in the centre of the park. Trialist leads the line."

Before their match later on Saturday against Stirling Albion, Dumbarton said: "All change for the clash with the Binos as Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist and Trialist come in for Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist and Trialist.

"Trialist, Trialist, Trialist and Trialist make up the bench."

A deal was struck for Dumbarton to exit administration earlier this month by dissolving its holding company and creating a new company wholly owned by Canadian businessman Mario Lapointe.

That means the club is still awaiting approval from the Scottish FA and SPFL about whether they can register new signings and continue to play in League 2, having been relegated last term following a 15-point deduction.

Manager Farrell said in the build-up to the game he would also be fielding trialists and younger players because of the handful of contracted senior players being on holiday.

"Amazing day for the Trialist family," one X user replied to the club as football fans joked about the team news.

Dumbarton lost both games 2-0, so 'Trialist' failed to get on the scoresheet.

Let's dive into the details: Nuno Espirito Santo has been in charge of Nottingham Forest since December 2023

Boss Nuno Espirito Santo has questioned Nottingham Forest's recruitment process in a surprise swipe at the club. 

The Portuguese is unhappy with the speed of Forest's transfer business and feels the squad is ill-equipped to handle a European campaign. 

Forest could spend close to Â£100m on Manchester City midfielder James McAtee, Ipswich winger Omari Hutchinson and Rennes forward Arnaud Kalimuendo in the next 48 hours, while there is also interest in Juventus midfielder Douglas Luiz. 

Yet, before Sunday's Premier League opener with Brentford at the City Ground, Nuno outlined his fears over the lack of signings.

"Dealing with doubts is the worst thing you can have in football," he said, having guided Forest to seventh last season.

"We have doubts, who is going to be [here], when are they [new signings] going to come? All these things create doubts. 

"Not only me but in the club. What we want is game-by-game to have as many options as possible. Europe will come after, and for sure it will be better, but for now until that happens it is a major concern.

"The owner is aware, the club is aware, everyone is aware. Everybody knows the reality. This is a lost chance that we had as a group to do it."

Forest have signed striker Igor Jesus and defender Jair Cunha from Botafogo, Bologna winger Dan Ndoye and goalkeeper Angus Gunn, but Nuno wants at least another goalkeeper, a full-back, winger and striker. 

They sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle for an initial Â£55m but Morgan Gibbs-White signed a new contract despite Tottenham trying to sign the midfielder, which left Forest considering legal action., external

Forest will compete in the Europa League this season, returning to Europe for the first time in 30 years, but Nuno feels even the players are concerned.

"They are very smart, they know how we operated last season and the way we established ourselves with the dynamic of the work," he said.

"This season is different, and then doubts and questions come in. As human beings we can sort problems but we can't solve doubts.

"There are players here who know they are going out on loan. Our pre-season was very, very bad. We didn't win one game and scored one goal.

"You think I'm going to be happy and comfortable here, thinking of that with the expectation?

"The players are not supermen, we are going to need to rotate them. That's a major problem with the intensity and demands of the games."

Nuno, though, denied he felt let down by the club. 

He added: "We have to understand, but I cannot hide I am worried. This is the reality and I deal with the reality. Should I be over the moon? Totally opposite."

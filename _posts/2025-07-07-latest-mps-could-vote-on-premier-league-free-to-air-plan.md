Here’s what you need to know: Liverpool are the current Premier League champions

MPs could be set to vote on a proposal to make at least 10 Premier League games available on free-to-air television each season.

The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the Football Governance Bill, which continues to make its way through parliament.

The legislation will establish a regulator that is independent from government and the sport's authorities to oversee the men's game in England's top five divisions.

The amendment would require it to ensure that the top-flight matches - along with the League Cup Final, and the Championship, League One and League Two play-off finals - would be free-to-air.

The Lib Dems say they are confident that a vote will be granted on the proposal.

Last year, the party committed to widen public access to major sporting events by ensuring more are available to view without subscription TV packages. It says it favours a similar approach to one taken in Spain where La Liga must offer one free game a week to fans after a change in the law in 2022.

Max Wilkinson MP, Lib Dem spokesperson for Culture, Media and Sport said: "I'm urging MPs of all stripes to back our amendment to tear down the paywall and make Premier League games available on free to air channels.

"For too long, the jewel in the crown of British football has been locked behind an expensive barrier that keeps fans out while lining the pockets of broadcasters.

"That must end today - with a free-to-air revolution that gives the Premier League back to the country."

A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said: "The government has no plans to review the listed events regime."

The Premier League declined to comment.

The legislation has now reached the report stage in the House of Commons.

A similar amendment was tabled at the committee stage last month.

At the time, the Sports Minister Stephanie Peacock said: "The listed events regime have protected key moments such as the FA Cup Final while ensuring that the Premier League, EFL & FA are able to raise billions of pounds annually, which is invested back into the pyramid.

"We all want to see more matches being televised free-to-air, but that must be balanced against that investment and not risk itâ¦ It would not be appropriate for the regulator to intervene in commercial decisions between the relevant broadcasters and rights holders."

The Lib Dems claim analysis of subscription prices shows that to watch each available Premier League game live next season fans will have to pay Â£660 a year.

Last month, it was revealed Premier League television viewing figures on main live rights-holder Sky Sports were down 10% last season, while TNT Sports had a 17% reduction in its year-on-year figures.

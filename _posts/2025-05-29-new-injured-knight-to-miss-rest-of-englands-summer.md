Experts revealed that Heather Knight was replaced by Nat Sciver-Brunt as England captain in April

England batter Heather Knight has been ruled out of international action for the rest of the summer with a hamstring injury and will also miss The Hundred.

Former captain Knight, 34, sustained the injury during England's win over West Indies in the third T20 on Monday.

She was limping and struggled to run between the wickets towards the end of her knock, managing to finish unbeaten on 66 in the 17-run win but unable to take the field for the second innings.

A scan on Tuesday revealed a "significant tendon injury to her right hamstring", the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said.

Alice Capsey, 20, has been added to the squad as Knight's replacement for the three-match one-day international series against West Indies, which begins on Friday at Derby.

"We are all devastated for Heather," said England bowler Kate Cross.

"She is no stranger to injuries. I don't think that necessarily makes it any easier but she has said she will aim for the World Cup and having that big competition in mind will give her the motivation to make sure she is there for it. 

"We are all sending her lots of love. We know how hard she works and how diligent she is with her fitness and rehab and those hamstrings."

England's squad for West Indies ODIs: Nat Sciver-Brunt (capt, The Blaze), Amy Jones (The Blaze), Charlie Dean (Somerset), Emily Arlott (Warwickshire), Tammy Beaumont (The Blaze), Lauren Bell (Hampshire), Alice Capsey (Surrey), Kate Cross (Lancashire), Alice Davidson-Richards (Surrey), Sophia Dunkley (Surrey), Mahika Gaur (Lancashire), Sarah Glenn (The Blaze), Lauren Filer (Durham, Emma Lamb (Lancashire), Linsey Smith (Hampshire).

The Windies series is followed by a further three T20s and three one-day internationals against India, who are then hosting the 50-over World Cup in September.

The ECB has not given a timeframe for Knight's return but is hopeful she will be available for selection for September's tournament.

Knight led England for nine years before she was removed from her position in March after the 16-0 Ashes humiliation at the beginning of the year. She was replaced by all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt, 32, a month later.

The ongoing West Indies series marks the beginning of the team's transition, with new coach Charlotte Edwards also in charge for the first time.

It is a significant blow for England to lose one of their most experienced batters, especially as Knight was in exceptional form in her first series back in the batting ranks, with unbeaten knocks of 43 and 66.

Knight was set to return to London Spirit for this year's Hundred, having led them to their first title in 2024.

She missed the Commonwealth Games, The Hundred and the home series against India in 2022 after surgery on a hip issue.

She also ruptured a tendon in her calf during England's defeat by West Indies at the T20 World Cup last autumn.

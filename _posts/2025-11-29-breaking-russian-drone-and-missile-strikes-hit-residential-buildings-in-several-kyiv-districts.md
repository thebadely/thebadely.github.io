Here’s what you need to know: A Russian drone and missile attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv has killed at least one person and injured seven others, city officials say.

Early on Saturday morning residential buildings in several districts were hit and loud explosions could be heard across the city.

Kyiv's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the injured and four people had been taken to hospital.

Earlier this week a similar attack on Kyiv killed seven people, Ukrainian officials said. The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend on an amended US peace plan. 

The head of Kyiv's military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, confirmed Saturday's strike hit "multiple targets on the capital's outskirts".

"Enemy drones are over the city, with air defence responding," he wrote on Telegram.

"Currently, in Kyiv there is a total of one dead and seven injured, including one child."

The body of a man was recovered by rescuers in the Sviatoshynskyi district west of the city, Tkachenko confirmed.

Two women were among the wounded in the town of Brovary east of Kyiv, with the regional governor saying "missiles and drones" targeted residential areas.

Klitschko said the strike had started a fire in the lower floors of a high-rise apartment block west of the city centre, while another blaze was brought under control in a central district.

Earlier this week, Russia and Ukraine traded deadly strikes overnight, which set fire to apartment buildings and killed seven people in Kyiv, while Russia's Rostov region reported three deaths.

Saturday's attack comes amid President Donald Trump's push for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily towards Moscow's demands. It was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva.

On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin doubled down on his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia will halt its offensive only if Ukraine's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.

Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan at the centre of negotiations.

Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet "to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees".

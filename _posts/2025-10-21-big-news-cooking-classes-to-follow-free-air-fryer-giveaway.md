According to new developments, Free cooking classes are being staged to help people save money with air fryers.

North Lincolnshire Council has given out thousands of air fryers to pensioners and low-income families over the past year in order to cut fuel bills.

Those who received one are being invited to the workshops, which will offer practical tips and meal guides. They will be held between 27 and 29 October.

Councillor Tim Mitchell, cabinet member for sustainability, said air fryers used less energy than conventional ovens, adding: "By giving residents the tools and know-how to use them confidently, we're helping households live more sustainably while cutting costs."

This winter, older residents in North Lincolnshire are due to receive extra fuel payments, free "winter warm" packs and low-energy appliances to cut bills, the authority said.

The cooking classes will last about 45 minutes, with time slots through the day. Places must be booked in advance.

Council leader Rob Waltham said: "These sessions are about sharing ideas, inspiring confidence and helping everyone make the most of the tools that can save energy and money day to day."

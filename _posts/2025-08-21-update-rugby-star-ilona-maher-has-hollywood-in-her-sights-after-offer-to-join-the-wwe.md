'I've been approached by WWE' - Will Maher follow in The Rock's footsteps?

Women's Rugby World Cup: England v United States

Venue: Stadium of Light, Sunderland Date: Friday, 22 August Kick-off: 19:30 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sport website and app.

Ilona Maher says she is contemplating an offer to enter professional wrestling with the WWE after playing for the United States at the Women's Rugby World Cup.

The 29-year-old social media sensation, who has nearly nine million followers across her Instagram, TikTok and X channels, has previously appeared on Dancing with the Stars and was named as 2025's best breakthrough athlete at US broadcaster ESPN's prestigious Espy award show.

"I've been approached before by the WWE," she told BBC Sport, joking that her ring name would be 'Maher-vellous'.

"I don't know if I would [go into wrestling]. I should think about it, there is great money in it."

Maher says that if she did get into wrestling it would be with the aim of progressing into Hollywood.

"I would love to get into the acting space and the scripted space. I think a Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson, John Cena progression - I would love to do that," she added.

"It would be exciting to see my body type on the screen. I'll start off small - probably like a hot assassin or something, let's not get too crazy!

"I'm not going to be in a rom-com just yet.

"We'll see. The world is open, but I do see myself coming back to rugby."

Johnson has starred in the Fast and Furious franchise and Disney blockbuster Moana since leaving WWE, while Cena's acting career includes a cameo in 2023 hit Barbie.

Maher would not be the first sports star to appear in WWE. 

Boxers Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayweather and Tyson Fury have all made cameos, while Olympic medallists Kurt Angle and Ronda Rousey have been key ongoing characters in the promotion.

Maher, who has been named at outside centre for Friday evening's World Cup opener against England in Sunderland, says she remains a rugby player first, despite her phenomenal success on social media and clutch of new ventures.

Having won a bronze medal with the US sevens team at Paris 2024, she joined Premiership Women's Rugby side Bristol Bears on a three-month contract in January to help her acclimatise to the 15-a-side game.

Her debut against Gloucester-Hartpury set a new attendance crowd for the league of 9,240 after the fixture was switched to Ashton Gate to accommodate more spectators, while her team's social media footprint also grew significantly.

"So many times people forget, but I am a rugby player first," Maher added.

"I do the social media because I have to because it is not sustainable to be a women's rugby player - I am not going to make money doing it.

"It does irk me at times when people forget that. One comment once was: 'Are you going to watch the Instagrammer play?'

"I was like, 'no, I have won a bronze medal, I've been to two Olympics, I am a good rugby player who loves the sport'.

"I am proud to do both but I do want to be known as a rugby player."

Maher's appearance in PWR brought record gates for Bristol Bears and some of their opponenets alike

The US are distinct underdogs against runaway world number ones and tournament favourites England on Friday.

However, Maher believes the absence of expectation frees up her and her team-mates against the hosts.

"I am going into it with the mindset not that we have something to lose, but something to gain from this. We have an opportunity here to have some fun.

"The Red Roses not having lost a game for more than 1,000 days - that is having something to lose. I don't think we do.

"They will be very tough opponents. For us to beat them, we would have to be on our A-game every single minute of that game.

"But I am just excited to play in front of 40,000 people. Whether we win or lose I want to be able to say that I enjoyed it."

The US take on Australia and Samoa in their remaining Pool A games. Two teams from each of the four pools advance to the quarter-finals.

Maher made her return to 15-a-side rugby earlier this year, having concentrated on sevens since 2021

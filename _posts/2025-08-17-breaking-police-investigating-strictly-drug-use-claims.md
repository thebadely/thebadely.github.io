Experts revealed that The Metropolitan Police has said it is investigating allegations of drug use on Strictly Come Dancing.

In a statement, the Met said it had "received an allegation about drug related offences".

"Police are assessing the information and further enquiries are taking place to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed," it said.

The BBC said it had "clear protocols and policies in place" for dealing with any serious complaints raised with it.

The Met's involvement comes after the the BBC launched an investigation earlier this month into alleged drug use by two stars of the show, who have not been named.

It followed a report in the Sun on Sunday, which said the alleged drug use by the stars was widely talked about on the show.

BBC News understands the corporation has hired a law firm to help it carry out the probe.

On Sunday, the Sun reported that the BBC had referred the matter to police. 

A Met spokesperson later confirmed that the force had "received an allegation about drug related offences" on Tuesday 12 August.

The BBC said it would not comment on any police investigation.

But it highlighted a previous statement which read: "We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. 

"We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further."

Strictly, which has been airing since 2004, has faced multiple controversies over the past few years relating to the behaviour of some of its professionals and celebrity guests.

It is believed, however, that this is the first time the BBC has been in contact with the police over allegations linked to the show.

Experts revealed that Harper and Mew Jensen won bronze at the 2024 Olympics

Great Britain's Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen claimed silver in the women's 3m synchronised diving final at the World Aquatics Championships.

The pair, who won Team GB's first medal of the 2024 Olympics with a bronze in Paris, finished off with their highest score of 69.75 as they achieved 298.35 points in Singapore.

China's Yiwen Chen and Jia Chen were top of the standings with 325.20 points, while Lia and Mia Cueva Lobato, of Mexico, were third with 294.36 points.

Harper and Mew Jensen have now won three consecutive medals together at the World Aquatics Championships, having claimed silver in 2023 and bronze in 2024.

In the men's 10m synchronised diving, GB's Kyle Kothari and Robbie Lee produced a strong last dive to finish fourth with 399.27 points as China's Zilong Cheng and Zifeng Zhu narrowly claimed gold with 429.63 points. 

In the swimming, American great Katie Ledecky won the 22nd world title of her career by claiming a dominant victory in the women's 1500m freestyle final.

The 28-year-old finished in 15 minutes 26.44 seconds as she won a sixth World Championship gold in the event, with Italy's Simona Quadarella second in 15:31.79 and Australia's Lani Pallister third in 15:41.18.

"I love this race. This race was the race that I broke my first world record in in 2013," said Ledecky, who has won nine Olympic golds.

"Lots of great races and memories over the years at worlds. I'm happy I could do it in Singapore."

Australia's Kaylee McKeown set a championship record to win the women's 100m backstroke final in 57.16 as she beat American rival Regan Smith, who was second in 57.35.

Smith took McKeown's world record in the event in 2024 when she set a time of 57.13 but had to settle for silver behind the Australian in the 100m and 200m backstroke finals at the 2024 Olympics.

"It's always very nerve-wracking, especially off the back of the Olympics," said McKeown, who also won the 100m and 200m backstroke titles at the Olympics in Tokyo.

"I was probably a bit more nervous than I would like to have been tonight."

Romania's David Popovici produced a strong finish to win his duel against American Luke Hobson in the men's 200m freestyle final.

Popovici, who won Olympic gold in the discipline in 2024, touched the wall in 1:43.53, while second-placed Hobson came home in 1:43.84.

"Even better than the Olympics to be honest," said Popovici. "You know why? I trained a lot for the Olympics but this year has been more relaxed and easygoing.

"I am very proud of myself."

Elsewhere, South Africa's Pieter Coetze took gold in the men's 100m backstroke final in 51.85 as Briton Oliver Morgan finished fifth in 52.37, while Germany's Anna Elendt (1:05.19) won the women's 100m breaststroke final.

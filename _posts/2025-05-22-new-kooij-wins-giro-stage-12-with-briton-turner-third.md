Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Olav Kooij secured his second Giro stage win

Olav Kooij won a close-fought sprint on stage 12 of the Giro d'Italia as Isaac del Toro retained the pink jersey in Viadana.

Dutchman Kooij benefited from Visma-Lease A Bike team-mate Wout van Aert's superb lead-out in the final kilometre.

Casper van Uden finished second with Britain's Ben Turner of Ineos Grenadiers third.

"Only he [Wout] can do it, so to have him as support here is extraordinary," said Kooij.

"I really need to thank him and also the rest of the team, they did a fantastic job. 

"You don't want to be too far [back] in that last corner, that's maybe why we had to go a bit earlier than we wanted but I could jump on the wheel of Casper and pass him."

Del Toro of UAE Team Emirates-XRG stayed out of the hectic fight for position in the closing stages to finish safely in the bunch and maintain his hold on the pink jersey.

A sprint for two bonus seconds at the Red Bull kilometre in Brescello means the 21-year-old heads into stage 13 with a 33-second lead over team-mate Juan Ayuso in the race overall. 

Kooij's British team-mate Simon Yates is in fourth, one minute and 11 seconds off the overall lead.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Keely Hodgkinson has not raced since winning 800m gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics

Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson will make her long-awaited return from injury at the Lausanne Diamond League meeting on 20 August.

The 23-year-old Briton has not raced competitively since winning gold in Paris last August after suffering a hamstring tear in February.

After a minor setback led to her withdrawing from Diamond League meetings in Stockholm and London, Hodgkinson is set to make her comeback just a month before the start of the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo.

"Third time's a charm!" she wrote on Instagram in reply to a post from the event organisers announcing her return.

Hodgkinson is aiming to find top form in time for the Worlds in September as she bids to go one better than the silver medals she won in 2022 and 2023.

The British 800m record holder will face compatriots Jemma Reekie and Georgia Hunter Bell, who triumphed in Hodgkinson's absence in London, on her return in Switzerland.

The event in Lausanne is the 13th of 15 in the Diamond League this season.

It concludes in Zurich on 27-28 August before the beginning of the World Championships on 21 September.

Experts revealed that Mathieu van der Poel also won stage two in 2021

Mathieu van der Poel edged out Tadej Pogacar in a sprint finish to win stage two of the Tour de France and claim the leader's yellow jersey.

The Dutch rider, who also won the same stage in 2021, held off the Slovenian on the line after surging to the front with 500 metres to go on the longest stage in this year's Tour, a rolling 209.1km route from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer.

Two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard finished third behind his great rival Pogacar, while Britain's Oscar Onley crossed the line in sixth. 

"It was super difficult, the final [part], harder than I thought," Van der Poel said.

"I was really motivated because it's been four years since I won my first stage on the Tour de France so it was about time I won a second one. Of course people put me as a favourite but if you see the riders that were in front on the climbs, I think I did a really good job to be there.

"It's a dream for a team, these first two days, and everything that comes now is just a bonus."

A fairly sedate stage sparked into life on three punchy climbs in the final 40km as a series of attacks split the peloton to leave a reduced group of riders at the front of the race.

And Van der Poel, who held the maillot jaune for six days four years ago, underlined his status as the favourite for a classics-style stage in a thrilling finale.

Earlier on Sunday, French team Cofidis said that 11 bikes were stolen from their team truck after the opening stage.

In a statement, the team said that the door of their equipment truck was forced open, and their Look bikes were taken "despite the security measures put in place".

Each bike stolen is estimated to be worth around 13,000 euros (Â£11,200). 

Cofidis said a police investigation was under way and that they "strongly condemn this act of incivility," while also calling on the "perpetrators to act with civility and responsibility".

All riders at the Tour generally have at least three bikes - their preferred one and two spares. 

Monday's third stage is a 178km run to Dunkirk, where a mass bunch sprint is expected.

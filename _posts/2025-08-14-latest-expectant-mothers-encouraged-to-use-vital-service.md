According to new developments, Thousands of expectant mothers in the East of England have taken up a new NHS service and more are being encouraged to take part.

Women across Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire and elsewhere have been using the service, where they can refer themselves directly to their local maternity services - without the need to first see a GP - by completing an online form.

Wendy Matthews, NHS England's chief midwife for the region, said the referral system was a "leap forward in helping women have more control" through their pregnancies.

Grace Sutton, from March, Cambridgeshire, who has used the system, said she found it to be "a really simple process".

The self-referral system was first rolled out in March and three quarters of NHS trusts in England are now connected.

In the East of England, 1,704 referrals have been made to Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, with a further 1,256 made to North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust.

Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust has had 1,218 referrals.

It is estimated that the new service could lead to 180,000 fewer calls to GPs - and up to 30,000 fewer general practice appointments each year.

Reflecting on her experience of the service, Ms Sutton added: "Once I had completed the form, I got a call within 48 hours from the community midwife about booking my appointment... it was really straightforward and reassuring to get the first appointment quickly."

First appointments provide an opportunity for women to discuss their pregnancy - and arrange early screening tests which can identify high-risk pregnancies.

Ms Matthews said: "GPs will always be available for any pregnant women who have concerns about their pregnancy that they need to discuss, or other health conditions that need monitoring, or who don't have access to smartphones. 

"However, GP teams don't need to be the first point of contact when someone finds out they're pregnant, so this quick and easy tool is also helping ease pressure on GP practice teams and freeing up time for other patients who are looking to make an appointment with their GP."

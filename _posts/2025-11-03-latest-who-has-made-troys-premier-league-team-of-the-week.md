According to new developments, After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): I know he was on the losing team at home to Chelsea but his Spurs team-mates abandoned him. He faced 18 shots, nine shots on target, an xG of 3.36 for Chelsea and he kept them in it. He didn't quit on his team.

Nico O'Reilly (Manchester City): This kid is frightening. He plays for Manchester City, is naturally a central midfielder and everyone forgets that. The way he plays at left-back is so intelligent. This kid impressed in the win against Bournemouth and I think he's a star of the future, I really, really do. 

Gabriel (Arsenal): Again, just a menace and so good to see. Another clean sheet for Arsenal this season. They are constantly on a rollercoaster. He is such a handful from set-pieces, a nuisance. He doesn't know much about the assist in the win at Burnley but just being there made the difference. You can feel the fear in the other teams.

Jean-Clair Todibo (West Ham): He is in for two reasons. Firstly, West Ham won a game, but I also thought he was measured and assured. Newcastle were not at their best, but you can only beat what is in front of you. I thought he was really good on the ball and calmed it down. Last few weeks he has looked ropey and a bit scared but it looked like he had grown a little bit under the guidance of Nuno Espirito Santo.

Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham): He got the team started in the win over Wolves. Excellent going forward and has been pretty good all season. I would argue he has been their most consistent player all season. He has added goals to his game and it is great to see him playing, fit and healthy.

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea): The only time where no other midfielder can complain about these choices. Absolutely pivotal for Chelsea. He was arguably the best ball-returning midfielder. He is like the Duracell Bunny. When he is at it, everyone is running and he pushes people forward. Arguably the best holding midfielder in world football.

Declan Rice (Arsenal): Another who was pivotal against Burnley. He was an absolute beast. He got the goal and is a monster from set-pieces. When they play the lesser teams and let Martin Zubimendi sit deep, Rice gets his energy back, he is making more attacking runs. It is important to see him let loose.

Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool): Went forward, gets a goal against a very poor Aston Villa team on the day. But his ability to dictate play with and without the ball, his vision and his tackling means he was again key to the win.

Diego Gomez (Brighton): He got two goals against Leeds, however he was elegant in the way he was gliding past people. He was running at pace with power. I could have put Danny Welbeck in his place but, on the day, I thought Gomez was better.

Erling Haaland (Manchester City): What more can we say about the machine? Every time he went through, you just thought 'goal'. He never looked like he was going to miss. The King of the Jungle is back. We spoke about Isak, Wissa, Woltemade all summer, but King Haaland is back. I wouldn't be surprised if he broke most scoring records this season.

Rayan Cherki (Manchester City): Playing high on the right is his best position for Manchester City. He is so two-footed it is a joke. I haven't seen anyone like that since Santi Cazorla, who could take a free-kick with both feet. Cherki can do the same. He is a talented, talented footballer, who looks fit and up to speed after his injury. His connection with Haaland is clearly why they have brought him in.

Nuno Espirito Santo (West Ham): If you haven't seen it, just look at the images of the way he celebrates that third goal going in against Newcastle. That is what it means to him and what it means to the team. He knows West Ham are up against it, but they have to be in a position to just get through and get over the line.

Let's dive into the details: Roston Chase has played 49 Test matches for West Indies

Roston Chase has been appointed West Indies Test captain even though he has not played a match in the format for more than two years.

The 33-year-old all-rounder succeeds Kraigg Brathwaite, who stepped down from the role at the end of March after 39 matches in charge.

Cricket West Indies (CWI) shortlisted five other players in addition to Chase for the position including Joshua Da Silva, John Campbell and Jomel Warrican.

The decision to select Barbados-born Chase was made after a detailed assessment process across six key areas which included psychometric testing.

West Indies coach Daren Sammy said he "fully endorsed" the appointment of Chase, whose vice-captain will be 32-year-old Warrican. 

"Our new captain has earned the respect of his peers and understands the responsibility that comes with the role," Sammy said.

"He has shown the leadership qualities we need to take this team forward. I urge fans across the region to rally behind him - we're building something special."

Chase has played 49 Tests, the last of which came against South Africa in March 2023, with West Indies having played 13 matches in the format since.

Chase has scored 2,265 Test runs at an average of 26.33, with five hundreds, and taken 85 wickets at 46.00 with his off-breaks.

His first assignment as captain will be a three-Test series against Australia which starts in Bridgetown on 25 June.

Chase is part of West Indies' squad for their white-ball tour of England, which starts on 29 May. 

Shai Hope, West Indies' limited-overs skipper, asked not to be considered.

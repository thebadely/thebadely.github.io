Experts revealed that Mohammed Kudus joined West Ham in the summer of 2023

Tottenham have completed the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for Â£55m, subject to a work permit. 

The Ghana midfielder, who had an Â£85m release clause, has joined Spurs on a six-year contract until 2031. 

West Ham rejected an initial Â£50m from Tottenham last week. 

Kudus, 24, made 65 Premier League appearances for the Hammers, scoring 13 goals and providing nine assists.

Speaking to the club's social media,, external Kudus said he has "always wanted to play at the highest level." 

He added: "How big the club is, the history and the Champions League as well, so it's a big moment. I'm very happy and can't wait to start." 

He could be joined by Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, who is set to have a medical at Spurs on Friday before completing a Â£60m move.

Kudus has been a key member of West Ham's squad since he signed in a Â£38m deal from Ajax in August 2023. He made his top-flight debut as a substitute in a win over Luton Town a month later before scoring his first goals for the Hammers during the Europa League group stage shortly after. 

In his first season at West Ham he scored 14 goals, including nine assists. 

Sources told BBC Sport that Kudus had prioritised a move to north London despite at least six top clubs enquiring about him. 

He cited head coach Thomas Frank, who replaced former Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou last month, as one of the main reasons for joining Tottenham. 

"From where [Frank] has come from, and seeing the amount of talent he has developed to become great players, it's a big sign as to why I wanted to work under him as well," said Kudus.

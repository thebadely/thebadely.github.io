Experts revealed that Philip Byrnes' fall happened in the first race on Wednesday as Wexford Racecourse in the Republic of Ireland

The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board will review jockey Philip Byrnes' final-hurdle unseat at Wexford on Wednesday.

Byrnes was leading the Wexford Claiming Hurdle on Redwood Queen, who is trained by his father Charles, heading into the final hurdle.

However, Byrnes was unseated after appearing to become unstable as Redwood Queen jumped the last, which allowed 1-3 favourite Beacon Edge to win by a comfortable margin.

The raceday stewards at Wexford felt no further action was required, but the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB) will now review the incident.

A IHRB spokesperson said on Thursday: "We note the position of the raceday stewards following their review of the incident. I can confirm the matter is down for review by an IHRB senior racing official."

The review will take into consideration the incident on the racecourse and other factors, such as betting patterns of the race.

Redwood Queen had drifted from 7-2 to 13-2 in the betting odds, and was running at 1/7 in-play at the time of the fall.

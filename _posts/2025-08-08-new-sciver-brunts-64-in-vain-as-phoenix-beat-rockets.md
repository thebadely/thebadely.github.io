Scorecard. Table

England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt became the first batter to pass 1,000 runs in The Hundred, but her Trent Rockets side lost by 11 runs against Birmingham Phoenix.

Chasing 149, Sciver-Brunt made 64 while her team-mates fell around her, with four Rockets batters out for single figures.

Her 40-ball innings featured eight fours and one six, and it briefly looked like she might drag Rockets to victory, but she was superbly caught by Millie Taylor off Em Arlott from the 96th ball of the chase.

That effectively ended the visiting side's chances and they closed on 137-6. 

Emma Lamb led from the front for Birmingham Phoenix, with the opener hitting 55 and putting on a 50-run partnership with Ellyse Perry for the second wicket. 

Ailsa Lister and Marie Kelly added 37 after a middle-order wobble, taking Phoenix to 148-5.

Watch the best shots of Lamb's innings as she hits 55 off 32 balls

Lamb has been in excellent form all summer, earning a recall to the England set-up thanks to her sheer weight of runs.

The 27-year-old has a new team for this season's Hundred after four years at Manchester Originals, and she marked her debut with her 16th 50+ score of the season. 

She struck nine fours in her 32-ball innings, sweeping conventionally and on the reverse as she dealt comfortably with Rockets' Australia spinners Ash Gardner and Alana King.

Lamb made it to 50 in 28 balls, her second half-century in the competition and the fastest of her career.

Having passed the landmark she looked set to press on to a major score, but instead lifted Gardner's delivery to King on the mid-wicket ropes.

That began a spell of Rockets pressure, as Phoenix lost three wickets for 10 runs, but Lamb's runs ultimately contributed to a total the visiting side could not surpass.

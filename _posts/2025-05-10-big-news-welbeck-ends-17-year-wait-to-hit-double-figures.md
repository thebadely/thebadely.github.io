Here’s what you need to know: Danny Welbeck has 77 goals and 31 assists in 362 Premier League appearances

A 17-year wait is finally over for Danny Welbeck.

For the first time in his career, the 34-year-old striker hit double figures for Premier League goals in a single season with his penalty in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves.

Shining for Brighton in the twilight of his career, Welbeck's latest contribution helped ensure the Seagulls remain firmly in the fight to secure European football with just two games remaining.

"It is a good milestone to have - and I feel like it could have been more," said Welbeck, who scored on his Premier League debut for Manchester United as a 17-year-old in November 2008.

"I'm looking forward to improving. We have two more games left and hopefully I'll get some more [goals]."

Much of the former Manchester United, Arsenal and Watford player's career has been disrupted by persistent injury issues, at least prior to his arrival on the south coast.

But he has now made as many as 29 appearances in three consecutive Premier League seasons for the first time in his career, helping him to at last score 10 goals in a campaign. 

He is one goal away from matching his most productive season across all competitions, scoring 12 times for Manchester United in 2011-12.

Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler said: "First of all I need to thank the medical department that Danny is on the pitch. Danny has never had so many minutes for us as he has had in this season.

"Danny is a special character, an unbelievable role model for everyone, especially the younger players, both on the pitch and on the side.

"On top of that, he is a great goalscorer. I am really happy for him that he has this record."

The importance of Welbeck's goals are clear too.

Each of the former England international's past nine goals in the competition have either put his side ahead (seven) or drawn them level (two).

They are vital interventions which have helped Brighton compete in the race for a lucrative European place, after the club had its first ever taste of football on that stage in last season's Europa League.

More of the same will be required in Brighton's final two games, against champions Liverpool and Europa League finalists Tottenham. 

But even beyond that, Hurzeler hopes that Welbeck, who will turn 35 in November, will still continue to deliver at the top level.

"I hope [he can carry on], but I can't see into to the future, so we will have to wait and see," Hurzeler said.

"He has to continue how he behaves at the moment. He is very professional and I am convinced that he can carry on for a long time."

Danny Welbeck scored his first Premier League goal on his debut in the competition for Manchester United against Stoke City on 15 November 2008

As Welbeck achieved a milestone in his 17th season, there was an emotional first for one of his team-mates.

German 20-year-old Brajan Gruda scored his first goal for the club since joining in a Â£25m deal from Bundesliga side Mainz last August.

Coming on as a 59th-minute substitute for his 23rd appearance in all competitions, the midfielder sank to the ground and covered his face as his team-mates gathered to celebrate with him.

"It is always difficult when a German makes a compliment to a German," Hurzeler joked.

"But I had to give him one because he's sacrificed a lot and he has suffered a lot.

"He's training hard and today he made himself a big presence. We are all happy for him."

Gruda, speaking to Sky Sports, said: "It was a hard season for me and I'm really happy to score my first goal. I'm happy the guys come to me and celebrated with me.

"I think you can see from the goal how many feelings are - it means a lot to me."

According to new developments, Girls have been encouraged to get involved in different sports at an event where they could have a go at a range of them.

The 'Every Girl Moves' event was held at Les Quennevais School on Monday with about 15 sports clubs on site to give taster sessions to children.

Research from the Youth Sport Trust has shown more than a third of girls in England and Wales drop out of playing sport by the time they reach secondary school.

The event was created by 15-year-old Lauren from St Marys Youth Centre after hearing how girls in the island sometimes faced barriers getting into sports.

Lauren wanted the event to show more girls in Jersey that many sports clubs in the island are approachable and have lots of opportunities for them.

She said: "Most girls want to be involved in sport but think it's just for boys or face other stigmas.

"Sport really improves your mental health too and more older girls need to stay active."

Lauren added: "I hope we do this every year and it improves every year so we can get even more sports involved so we can make the day even better."

Organisers also hope getting involved with sports teams will also boost girls' confidence and socialising skills.

Orla, 11, was one of the children who attended.

She said: "It's really important to stay healthy - if you stay on the couch all day then you won't be living for very long.

"I think when girls get older they get obsessed with things like TikTok but I will definitely stay sporty and I think girls should just spend your life doing the stuff you love," Orla added.

She tried out netball, football and other sports available at the event.

Mimi, 16,  is the youth representative for Jersey Netball and showed children how to play the sport.

She said: "It's a competitive sport but you have loads of fun too - everyone who plays enjoys it".

She added: "When you're older and you have to mix with boys for some sports it can put girls off because you can feel a bit scared but sports events like this are prefect to change that perception."

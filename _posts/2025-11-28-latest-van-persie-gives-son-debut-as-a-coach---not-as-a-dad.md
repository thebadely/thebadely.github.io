According to new developments, Shaqueel van Persie made his senior debut at the same club as father Robin

Robin van Persie says his decision to hand son Shaqueel a senior debut in Feyenoord's Europa League defeat by Celtic was made "as a coach" and not out of sentiment.

The 19-year-old forward spent two seasons at Manchester City's academy, before following in his father's footsteps with a move to Feyenoord in 2017 and signing a first professional contract with the Dutch club in 2022.

Fast forward to 2025 and Shaqueel was named in Feyenoord's first-team squad for the first time in Sunday's Eredivisie defeat by NEC Nijmegen.

Four days later he made his senior debut, coming on in the 81st minute of Feyenoord's Europa League loss to Celtic.

"I made that call as a coach, not as a dad because we needed a goal," said former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Robin afterwards.

"Shaqueel is a player who can score a goal from all angles. That was the reason I brought him on.

"From a father's point of view, when your son makes his debut that is always a special moment. But I wasn't that busy with enjoying that moment, I was doing my work like Shaqueel was."

The London-born teenager didn't have chance to make an impact and had just one shot in Celtic's box.

He came on with the score at 2-1, with Martin O'Neill's side scoring their third a minute after his introduction.

"The way I see Shaqueel is as one of the players," added Robin. "This is what we both agreed to a couple of years ago when we already worked together. Shaqueel was handling that really well, I am too in my opinion.

"Later on when we are home of course we will have a nice moment, when we are proud of each other. I am proud of Shaqueel because, like every player who makes his debut, there is a whole process going on before he made his debut. He worked hard, deserved it and, for him, is a special moment." 

Van Persie is not the first manager to give his son a debut as BBC Sport picks out some of the others, plus other father-son duos to have featured in the same team.

Netherlands legend Johan Cruyff is one of football's most revered names - a hero as a player and manager with Ajax and Barcelona.

His son Jordi played 54 times for the Spanish giants during Johan's time as Barca boss - and both left the club in the summer of 1996. 

Jordi had a decent career by normal standards, and also played for Manchester United and nine times for his country, but could never live up to his father's iconic status.

"He was demanding to me in front of others, absolutely. He would give me a shout and the hairs would stand up," he told BBC Radio 5 Live in 2019 about working with Johan.

Jamie Redknapp started and ended his career under Harry at different clubs - playing 38 times for him in total. He came through at Bournemouth under his dad at the age of 16, before moving to Liverpool in 1991. And aged 31, he joined Harry at Southampton in 2005, although he retired six months later through injury.

Harry also managed his nephew Frank Lampard when he was West Ham boss.

Alex Bruce played more games (116) under his dad Steve than he did any other manager. That was at Birmingham in 2005-06 and then three years at Hull later in his career.

He also worked on his dad's coaching staff at West Brom.

Club legend Zinedine Zidane actually played two of his sons at Real Madrid. Midfielder Enzo played one Copa del Rey match, and scored, while goalkeeper Luca played two La Liga games.

Both had left Real before Zinedine's second spell ended in 2021.

Midfielder Darren played for Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, but left for Wolves in 1994 after being part of his dad's Premier League title-winning squad in 1992-93.

He came through the youth ranks at Old Trafford and was handed his senior debut in 1990, making 29 appearances in total.

Argentine forward Giuliano Simeone has had loan spells at Zaragoza and Alaves, but spent the majority of his career so far playing for his dad Diego at Atletico Madrid.

The 22-year-old made his senior debut in a La Liga game against Granada in April 2022, coming on as a 91st-minute substitute.

Versatile former Ajax and Manchester United defender Daley Blind played under his dad Danny when he led the Netherlands national team from 2015 to 2017.

Here’s what you need to know: Kim Kardashian has poked fun at critics who savaged her new legal TV drama by posting screen shots of fans deciding to tune in after seeing the terrible reviews.

She plays a divorce lawyer in Disney+ series All's Fair, which was described as "so awful, it feels almost contemptuous" by the Guardian, while the Times declared that it "may be the worst TV drama ever".

She asked her 354 million Instagram followers: "Have you tuned in to the most critically acclaimed show of the year!?!?!? All's Fair streaming now."

The show is currently scoring just 5% on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, although it also has a more respectable 66% score from audiences.

Kardashian's shared a selection of fans' posts about the show, including one joking about critics realising "their reviews of All's Fair ended up making peple watch and love the show".

The series co-stars Sarah Paulson, Naomi Watts, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash and Teyana Taylor.

Another fan comment, highlighting the line-up, said All's Fair "dares to ask the question 'does a show need to be good?' and the answer is no, it doesn't".

The comment added: "We have legendary actresses here giving the worst performances of their careers, it takes a special kind of talent to pull that inability of them. Amazeballs."

This is Kardashian's second foray into acting after her casting in 2023's 12th season of American Horror Story, in which she appeared as a publicist, receiving mostly positive reviews.

All's Fair reunites the star with American Horror Story showrunner Ryan Murphy, who was also behind hit series such as Glee and Pose.

The Huffington Post said the show was "torn apart" by critics, with some giving it zero out of five. Its writer Daniel Welsh said: "The glossy sheen of the show and its stacked cast might make you think it's verging on 'so bad it's good' territory, but it's really just a boring dud."

Other critics include Alison Herman, writing in Variety that it is a "clumsy, condescending take on rah-rah girlboss feminism", while the Hollywood Reporter's Angie Han called Kardashian an "appropriately wooden lead for Ryan Murphy's empty, unforgivably dull drama".

But undeterred, the reality star and businesswoman shared fan reactions including one who said they "immediately pressed play" after seeing a post saying the show had debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a paltry 0%.

She also included a BBC News Instagram post quoting the Daily Telegraph's Ed Power, who wrote: "Ryan Murphy is the high priest of tacky tasteless television, and this year he has outdone himself."

Another fan said: "Some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life alongside the most predictable storylines and the most ridulous styling. I'm obsessed. I need 14 seasons."

Kardashian ended her post with what is arguably the last laugh.

She shared a screenshot from Disney Hulu, stating that the show is curently the most watched title on Disney+ around the world, ranking first in 28 countries including the US.

Let's dive into the details: Dan Cole reached the World Cup final with England in 2019

Leicester Tigers stalwart Dan Cole will leave the club after 18 years due to personal reasons.

Cole, 38, played for the Tigers between 2007 and 2025 before taking up the role of recruitment and retention manager after hanging up his boots.

The former prop turned out over 340 times for the club - breaking the record of league appearances for Leicester in 2023-24.

"I am leaving Tigers with a heavy heart," Cole said.

"This club means everything to me and it has been an honour to represent the badge. Unfortunately, a change in personal circumstances dictates that I cannot give the role the attention it deserves moving forwards so I am stepping away.

"I have no doubt that the club is on strong footing for 2026 and beyond and wish Geoff, the players and everyone at Mattioli Woods Welford Road the best of luck."

Leicester-born Cole won four Premiership titles during his time at Welford Road.

He also represented England on 118 occasions and helped them win three Six Nations championships.

"Dan leaves the club, but his legacy as a player, employee and most importantly as a person will remain," Tigers chief executive Andrea Pinchen said.

"He epitomises the toughness, passion and love for the badge that this club is all about.

"He will be missed."

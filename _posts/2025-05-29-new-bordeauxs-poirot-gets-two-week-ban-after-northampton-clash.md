Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Henry Pollock had played only one Premiership game before the start of this season but is now on the Lions tour this summer 

Bordeaux-Begles prop Jefferson Poirot has been given a two-week ban for an altercation with Northampton's Henry Pollock after the Champions Cup final.

Poirot was cited for grabbing the throat of the England and Lions flanker as tempers boiled over after the final whistle had blown to confirm his side's 28-20 win at Cardiff's Principality Stadium.

Poirot will miss the final two games of Bordeaux's regular season.

Tournament organiser European Professional Club Rugby said Poirot "accepted that he had committed an act of foul play that warranted a red card".

A statement added: "The independent disciplinary committee upheld the complaint and it determined that the offending was at the low-end of World Rugby's sanctions and four weeks was selected as the appropriate entry point.

"Taking into account the player's guilty plea, his good disciplinary record and his full co-operation with the disciplinary process, the committee decided to reduce the sanction by the maximum of 50% before imposing a two-week suspension."

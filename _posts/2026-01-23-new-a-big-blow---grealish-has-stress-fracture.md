Here’s what you need to know: Jack Grealish has scored four goals in 39 games for England

Everton manager David Moyes says it is a "big blow" that winger Jack Grealish has a stress fracture in his foot.

The 30-year-old, who is on a season-long loan from Manchester City, has made 22 appearances in all competitions for Everton this season.

He has scored two goals and provided six assists.

"It's a big blow because he's been hugely important to us since the start of the season," said Moyes.

"It's not for me to give the timescales - we've not got it from the doctors yet."

Grealish played the full 90 minutes as Everton beat former club Aston Villa 1-0 in the Premier League on Sunday.

Everton, who are 10th in the table, host Leeds United on Monday.

Moyes said Everton are in "close contact" with City about whether Grealish will stay during his recovery.

Asked how it impacts the possibility of making the transfer permanent in the summer, Moyes said: "We're not thinking about it at the moment.

"We're only thinking about Jack. We're upset and disappointed for him that he's got an injury."

Grealish's form at Everton led to suggestions that he could earn a recall to the England squad and push for a place at the World Cup this summer.

His most recent appearance came under caretaker manager Lee Carsley in October 2024.

Grealish won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup after joining City from Aston Villa for a then British record Â£100m in 2021.

But he fell out of favour last season, making only seven league starts before being left out of the squad for the Club World Cup in the US.

Grealish's loan move has been regarded as a big success by Moyes, Everton fans and the player himself.

Grealish's spell on the sidelines now begs the question of whether he will remain at Everton when the season ends.

Everton are almost certain to want to keep Grealish - and all the indications are that he would like to stay, having spoken in the most glowing terms of his close relationship with Moyes, who was integral to the initial deal.

There will be other factors at play, however, such as Grealish's age, the financial package he would require, plus the fee City would demand.

Everton would not go anywhere near the Â£50m mentioned for a permanent deal last summer.

Grealish's injury has now added another complication, as Everton are sure to want to wait to see how recovers from this serious setback.

Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman told BBC Sport: "It's a huge blow. He's been the marquee signing.

"He's completely bought into Everton as a club. It's been a perfect match for him and David Moyes in terms of what was needed.

"There were questions about whether he would suit Everton - whether he would be the right fit - but he has immersed himself in the environment and seems to have loved it.

"He's been playing with a smile on his face again and he makes Evertonians smile. He's been outstanding and his attitude has been great.

"I'm not looking forward to the next few weeks without him.

"Jack needed somewhere to play football with the fans behind him, get an opportunity to become the hero again, the main man.

"Everton needed a player to come in with a big character to be creative. And Jack's character off the field has been just as important as well as his expressions of character on it."

Osman agrees, though, that there is much to be taken into consideration before any permanent deal is done.

"If there were no financial considerations, it would be a unanimous 'yes' from everyone", he said.

"Everton must ask themselves if, taking cost into consideration, they want to get wrapped up in something long term again that is potentially not financially viable or not in the best interests of the club.

"Any deal would have to leave Everton in a strong position to strengthen elsewhere.

"They couldn't splash the whole wage bill on him because they have other positions to look at. They've been light at times this season.

"Everton have been burned in the market before and are trying to move past that.

"They need to strengthen elsewhere but, if the price is right, it's not even a question."

Grealish does not appear to have a future at Etihad Stadium after being allowed to leave in the summer, and there is more competition in the front three following the arrival of Antoine Semenyo.

Grealish was the face of City's Treble-winning season in 2023 but his form fell away after that campaign and Jeremy Doku is now preferred on the left.

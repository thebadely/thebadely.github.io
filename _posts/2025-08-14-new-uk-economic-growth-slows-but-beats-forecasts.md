According to new developments, UK economic growth slowed between April and June, according to official figures, but was better than expected.

The economy expanded by 0.3%, down from 0.7% in the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics said.

The biggest rise came from the construction industry while services also grew.

The UK government has made boosting economic growth a key priority and the latest data beat forecasts of 0.1% expansion.

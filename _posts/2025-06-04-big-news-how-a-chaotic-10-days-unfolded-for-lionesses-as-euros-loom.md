Experts revealed that Millie Bright has made 88 appearances for England

With Sarina Wiegman naming her Euro 2025 squad at 14:00 BST on Thursday, two senior international retirements and the withdrawal of her World Cup captain is not exactly ideal.

It has been a chaotic and unsettling 10 days for the Lionesses, with distractions off the pitch dominating the end of their Women's Nations League campaign, which was brought to a close with defeat by Spain.

Goalkeeper Mary Earps stunned supporters when she stepped away from international duty, informing players four days before England's win over Portugal.

Fran Kirby followed suit a week later, announcing her decision within an hour of England's defeat by world champions Spain late on Tuesday.

And, with several players still on a flight home when the news dropped on Wednesday, Millie Bright revealed she was withdrawing from selection because of "personal reasons" - having taken an "extended period of recovery" this week.

It has led to some questioning over what is happening within the squad, and what repercussions there will be - with England attempting to defend their Euros crown. 

They have been drawn in a tough group at the tournament, which starts on 2 July, facing the Netherlands, France, who are ranked 10th and 11th in the world, and neighbours Wales. Only two from the group will advance to the quarter-finals.

The squad were rocked when Earps, following conversations with manager Wiegman, decided to step down from international duty with her position as England's number two all but confirmed.

She had fallen down the pecking order since her heroics at Euro 2022 and the 2023 Women's World Cup and, with Chelsea's Hannah Hampton having started three successive matches, her role in Switzerland was expected to be a different one.

That played a large part in Earps' sudden decision, which clearly disappointed Wiegman - who described it as a "hard" week for the Lionesses.

Meanwhile, Bright had already withdrawn from the squad to focus on her wellbeing, but Wiegman hoped she would feel well enough to rejoin the group for the Euros.

Players reached out to Bright while at St George's Park in the build-up to their 6-0 win over Portugal last Friday, but Wiegman's doubts were clear as she admitted she "did not know" whether the Chelsea captain would return in time.

Kirby's retirement rubbed salt into England's wounds after an eye-opening defeat by Spain - who are seen as strong favourites for the Euros title next month.

Her decision was understandable, given she had had "honest conversations" with Wiegman throughout the past few weeks and was told she was not set to make the squad.

With retirement in the summer already in mind Kirby accelerated her decision, but the timing only fuelled the chaos that existed during England's preparations.

Bright selflessly confirmed 12 hours later that she was "unable to give 100% mentally or physically", and that was the final blow in a damaging week for England.

She had started every game as England won the Euros in 2022, and again as she captained the Lionesses to the World Cup final in 2023. When fit, she is one of the first names on Wiegman's teamsheet and would have been a shoo-in for the squad.

Each situation has come about in different circumstances but, combined, it makes for a grim picture.

Kirby's choice felt like the right one after the 31-year-old's efforts to move from the fringes into the final 23-player Euros squad ultimately did not pay off.

She had struggled with injury since starting every game at Euro 2022, missing the World Cup after knee surgery and withdrawing from recent squads with minor issues - her place in the squad was up for debate and Wiegman made her call.

Wiegman spoke highly of Kirby in the moments after she had informed her team-mates in the dressing room in Barcelona.

She had been left out of the squad for the 2-1 defeat by Spain and Wiegman addressed media, saying she was "proud" of Kirby's career and calling her an "inspiration".

Both Kirby and Wiegman said they had "honest conversations" and had communicated frequently in recent weeks. It ended on good terms, with full transparency.

There was also sympathy from Wiegman regarding Bright's wellbeing, with the Dutchwoman saying last week the priority was "to take care of herself".

"She has to take the time that will help her settle. We'll stay in contact and I hope she feels better soon. We have people around who can give that support," Wiegman added.

Captain Leah Williamson said Bright's decision to speak out about her mental health was a "brave thing to do".

"I think it encourages other people to do the same," said Williamson.

"She's leading by example. Anything that she needs from the team, we will be there to give it to her."

There were mixed views when Earps' retirement was announced two weeks ago - some among the media and fanbase calling it a "selfish" decision.

She was still a valuable member of Wiegman's squad - the manager said so herself - and she wanted Earps to be in Switzerland, using her experience to aid Hampton.

Wiegman admitted she was "really disappointed and sad", and that the news had come as a "shock" to the players. 

She was hesitant to discuss details around the timing of Earps' decision but it was clear Wiegman was emotional, stating: "I find it hard".

'Sad' Wiegman & 'devastated' Williamson on Earps' retirement

Wiegman became the first coach to win the Euros with two different teams, and this summer will aim to become only the second to win three consecutive European Championships.

She can only select 23 players and there are always difficult choices. 

She omitted former captain Steph Houghton from the squad in 2022, with the armband going to Williamson - who had played just seven minutes at a major tournament.

Houghton later said she was disappointed by the lack of communication from Wiegman, but those close to the Dutchwoman say she is ruthless in her decision-making.

Wiegman can be sharp and straight to the point, efficient with her time, and always insistent on decisions that are best for the squad - not based on sentiment.

That ruthlessness is nothing new - Wiegman dropped Netherlands captain Mandy van den Berg after the first two group games at Euro 2017.

Ultimately, she went on to win both tournaments, proving her worth as one of the world's leading coaches.

"When she first took the job I was looking into her thinking 'who is this, I want to know what her squad profile is'," former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley told 5 Live.

"I looked at what she had done with the Netherlands and she culled loads of 30-year-olds. I thought I had no chance. 

"I was out injured and I remember having a phone call with her and she was like 'where are you at?' I told her I was still injured. She said: 'I'm going to give you six weeks to let me know if you're going to be fit enough or not'.

"I thought that was quite an ultimatum. I tried to get back fit and I couldn't, so I had to call her and say I'm not going to make it. I'm going to have to retire.

"With the intensity she wants to play at, the game does catch up with you and it gets to a point where it moves beyond you."

Wiegman said on Tuesday she is "close" to knowing her final squad for Euro 2025, but insists there is still time to work out her starting XI.

A major dilemma is whether to gamble on the fitness of Lauren James.

The Chelsea forward was not involved in the recent Lionesses camp because of a hamstring injury suffered in April, and she has not featured for club or country since.

But Wiegman said she was "pretty positive" about James' Euros chances, saying numerous times this week that she is on track and "ticking the boxes".

"LJ is special. She can produce something that is quite extraordinary, that can spin a game on its head," said ex-striker White.

"Do you take a risk on someone that is talented, that could potentially come on for 10 or 15 minutes and do something completely special? It is a real headache for Sarina."

Another outsider is 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who scored a stunning goal just 41 seconds into her senior debut in April.

Bardsley believes the Brighton forward is worth a punt.

"When I saw her play for the under-23s I thought she was on another level.

"She is an incredible talent. I don't want to hype her up too much because she is young. 

"She has put in her application and hopefully Sarina accepts, because I'd love to see her in Switzerland."

Players face a nervous wait before Thursday's announcement and Bronze admitted there were "a lot of big decisions" for Wiegman to make.

"You can only pick 23 players. We have more than 23 players that deserve to be at the Euros based on talent, on effort and on experience," she added.

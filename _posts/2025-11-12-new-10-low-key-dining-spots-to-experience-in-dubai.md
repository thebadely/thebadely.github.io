With two UAE outposts in Dar Wasl, Dubai and AlJada, Sharjah, this Persian restaurant is anything but low-key when it comes to flavour and decor – it is, after all, awarded with the prestigious Michelin Guide Bib Gourmand for two consecutive years. The vibe reminds you of a hole-in-the-wall eatery along the streets of Tehran, while the mazeh-style dishes and charcoaled kababs are reminiscent of home-cooked, mum-made meals, delivering the kind of dining experience that you would want with family or visiting friends.

Found down a fridge-lined corridor in the French restaurant, Japanese restaurant and bar Gohan is a dark, moody, tucked away space. This intimate space can seat 30 diners at a time with the DJ spinning to some of the most eclectic tunes all night. “The main guideline when it comes to Gohan was to get as close as the authentic Japanese food with a twist of modernity and street food”, Chef Gilles Bosquet told Emirates Woman in an interview. It’s open from Monday to Friday 12pm to 4pm and for dinner from 7pm to 2am daily.

Located on the ground floor of the Golden Tulip Hotel in Al Barsha, its entrance is straight out of Tokyo and designed to resemble a traditional storefront with lanterns, handwritten signs, and warm colours. WAWA takes a modernized touch on Korean-infused Japanese cuisine with a varied selection of spirits, Maki, Jako Fresh and WAWA platters. This low-key spot is definitely a must-visit.

It has been recently reported that Vincent Tan took control of Cardiff City in 2010

Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan says the club have started a review of "several structures and practices" following relegation to League One.

The Bluebirds will be playing third-tier football next season for the first time since 2003 following a miserable campaign in which Erol Bulut, Omer Riza and Aaron Ramsey have all taken charge of the first team.

Sections of the club's fanbase protested against owner Tan following Saturday's 0-0 draw with West Bromwich Albion - a result that confirmed Cardiff's relegation.

The Malaysian businessmen has hit back at criticism that he has minimal contact with the club.

"To say I don't care is wrong and I strongly push back on that," his statement read.

"I watch every game and speak to the board and manager before and after each one. My family will tell you: I kick every ball!"

A statement from the club and its board of directors does acknowledge calls from Cardiff City Supporters' Trust for communication from the club's hierarchy, as well as recognising the "overwhelming feeling of supporter sadness and frustration" following relegation.

"This will be the first time in 22 years that Cardiff City Football Club has not been a Premier League or Championship club and it's a reality that we are determined to address and correct at the earliest opportunity," the statement adds.

"To have the best chance of achieving this, there will be a thorough period of review across several structures and practices. 

"This review has begun and involves the owner, board, executive management and stakeholders."

Ramsey was tasked with taking charge of Cardiff's final three matches of the season following the departure of Riza fewer than 24 hours after the Bluebirds were beaten 2-0 by Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on 18 April.

The Wales captain oversaw draws against Oxford United and West Bromwich Albion, although Cardiff slipped to the foot of the table. They sit five points behind 21st-placed Luton Town going into their final match of the campaign at Norwich City on Saturday, 3 May (12:30 BST).

The club also said the review will focus on bringing a fresh coaching team to the club.

"It will culminate in the appointment and announcement of a new permanent manager and management team that can sculpt and coach a competitive squad through pre-season and into the 2025-26 campaign," the statement continued.

"This message has been internally communicated to club staff as the first point of a developing strategy. 

"We commit to communicating further strategy points with you as the summer progresses; as appointments are made; as our revamped playing squad takes shape; and as we rebuild."

Cardiff claimed just one point from the first six matches of the season as Bulut was sacked in September.

He was replaced by Riza who oversaw a significant lift early on before the club's form nosedived again in the new year.

Prior to the end of his tenure, Riza labelled some of the club's fans "clueless", later apologising after his comments were branded "disrespectful" by the Supporters' Trust.

Cardiff were unable to get the vital victories they needed under Ramsey - who said everyone connected to the club "has to look at themselves in the mirror".

"We have to be big enough to accept that and we need to get it right for next season," said the Wales midfielder.

"It's so important because this club has got so much potential. It's just about getting that right now and hopefully responding well to this and bouncing back quickly."

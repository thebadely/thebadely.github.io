Experts revealed that James Maddison sustained the injury in Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League

Tottenham midfielder James Maddison is expected to miss the final three weeks of the season with a knee injury.

The 28-year-old scored but was then injured during last Thursday's 3-1 win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League semi-final first leg.

Head coach Ange Postecoglou sounded positive in the immediate aftermath of the game.

But it became clear on Friday morning the injury was more serious than first feared and subsequent scans have confirmed that.

Sources have indicated that Maddison is being assessed for knee ligament damage, the extent of which will be clarified in the next 48 hours.

The news will arrive as a blow to Tottenham, who are in pole position to reach the Europa League final, with the second leg in Norway on Thursday, 8 May.

But Maddison will almost certainly not be available for either the semi-final second leg or the potential final in Bilbao this month.

Speaking following the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Sunday, Postecoglou said: 'We'll probably get some clarity [on Monday].

"It is fair to say it's not looking promising, but we'll just wait and see."

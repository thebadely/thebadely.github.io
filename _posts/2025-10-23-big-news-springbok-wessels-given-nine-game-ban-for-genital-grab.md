According to new developments, Wessels will not be available for South Africa's autumn internationals

South Africa front-rower Jan-Hendrik Wessels has received a nine-match suspension for grabbing Josh Murphy's genitals in the Bulls' United Rugby Championship win over Connacht. 

The incident occurred in the 18th minute of the Bulls' 28-27 win in Galway on Friday, with Connacht forward Murphy given a 20-minute red card after reacting angrily by striking Wessels on the head.

After Murphy complained about Wessels to referee Mike Adamson, the incident was checked by television match official (TMO) Hollie Davidson, who found no conclusive video evidence.

Wessels remained on the field until he was substituted in the second half. 

While the URC confirmed Murphy's 20-minute red card has been rescinded by a disciplinary panel, Wessels was found to have breached law 9.27, which states: "A player must not do anything that is against the spirit of good sportsmanship. This includes grabbing, twisting or squeezing the genitals."

The panel were satisfied that the incident met the red card threshold and warranted a 12-week suspension, the shortest ban under World Rugby rules for such an offence.

However, Wessels' suspension was reduced by three weeks because of the player's "good conduct prior to and at the hearing and good record". 

Wessels and the Bulls have the right to appeal, but as it stands, the ban will rule the 24-year-old out of the Springboks' autumn Tests against Japan, France, Italy and Ireland. 

He will also miss the Bulls' URC games against Glasgow, the Lions and the Sharks and Investec Champions Cup fixtures with Bordeaux and Northampton. 

Wessels has won 10 caps for South Africa and was part of their Rugby Championship-winning squad over the summer. 

Murphy, meanwhile, is available to face Munster in Saturday's inter-provincial derby after being cleared.

Scotland have suffered a triple injury blow as they prepare to face Greece in World Cup qualifying, with likely starter Billy Gilmour ruled out of Saturday's match in Piraeus.

The Napoli midfielder has not pulled out of the squad completely, with the Scots facing Denmark in a potential Group C decider three days later at Hampden Park.

But Udinese midfielder Lennon Miller and Bristol City defender Ross McCrorie have withdrawn.

Two midfielders have been added to Steve Clarke's squad - Rangers' Connor Barron and West Ham United's Andy Irving.

Scotland head coach Clarke plays down keeper crisis

Midfielder Gilmour was forced off with an adductor injury shortly before half-time during Napoli's 0-0 draw with Como just over a week ago.

He has since missed the midweek Champions League draw with Eintracht Frankfurt and Sunday's 2-0 defeat by a Bologna side captained by Scotland team-mate Lewis Ferguson as the reigning Italian champions slipped from top to fourth place.

The Scottish FA revealed on Monday: "Billy Gilmour will not travel to the training camp in Turkey due to an injury so will play no part in the game against Greece."

Miller was also missing from Udinese's squad as they lost 2-0 to Roma, while McCrorie came off after 57 minutes of Bristol City's 1-1 draw with Watford.

McCrorie had been recalled by Scotland head coach Clarke to provide right-back cover with Brentford's Aaron Hickey only just back from the injury he sustained during the last international window and with Derby County's Max Johnston and Everton's Nathan Patterson now sidelined.

Scotland sit second behind Denmark on goal difference and, with Brian Riemer's side likely to take three points against bottom side Belarus, Clarke's men need a point against already eliminated Greece to set up a winner-take-all climax to the group for the automatic qualifying place.

Whoever finishes second will have a second chance via the play-offs.

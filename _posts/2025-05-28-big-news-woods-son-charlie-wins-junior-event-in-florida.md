Let's dive into the details: Florida-born Charlie Woods was the second-lowest ranked player in the field of 72

Charlie Woods has won his first American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) event to follow in father Tiger's footsteps.

The 16-year-old American claimed a three-shot victory at the Team TaylorMade Invitational in Bowling Green, Florida.

Tiger Woods played in 13 AJGA tournaments from 1991 to 1993, winning eight - the joint highest behind Phil Mickelson.

In his fifth AJGA event, Charlie began the final round one shot behind overnight leader Luke Colton.

Ranked 606th by the AJGA, the teenager mixed two bogeys with eight birdies for a six-under-par 66 on the Black Course at Streamsong Resort which saw him top the the leaderboard at 15 under.

Willie Gordon (65), Phillip Dunham (68) and Colton (70) finished three shots behind for a share of second place.

Before this week, the younger Woods' best result on the AJGA circuit was a share of 25th place at the Junior Invitational at Sage Valley in March.

He has competed with his father in the last five editions of the PNC Championship - a 36-hole event featuring two-player teams made up of a major champion and a family member - and last December they finished runners-up for a second time.

Tiger, a 15-time major winner, has been absent from tournaments since he underwent surgery in March to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon and is expected to miss the rest of the PGA Tour season.

Red Roses answer quickfire questions

England and Canada will meet on Saturday in the World Cup final as the two highest ranked teams in women's rugby union chase the sport's biggest prize.

World number one outfit and tournament hosts England overcame France to reach their seventh successive final.

England, who have been fully professional since 2019, are bidding to win the World Cup for a third time and are targeting a first title since beating Canada in the 2014 final.

The Red Roses have won a world record 32 successive Test matches and go into the final as favourites.

They are also seeking to make up for the heartbreak of the 2022 final where their 30-match winning streak was ended in a 34-31 loss to New Zealand.

Canada outclassed defending champions New Zealand on Friday to reach their second final.

They are not professional and set up a Â£530,000 (C$1m) fundraising drive - titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup - to help them prepare for the tournament.

The final, which kicks off at 16:00 BST, will be shown live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Women's Rugby World Cup final: England v Canada

Saturday, 27 September at 16:00 BST

Allianz Stadium, Twickenham

A capacity crowd at Twickenham is expected for Saturday's final

The final will be held at Twickenham in front of what will be a record crowd for a one-off women's rugby match.

Tickets for the 82,000-capacity Allianz Stadium sold out a month ago, with the attendance therefore set to beat the record of 58,498 from when England played France in the 2023 Six Nations.

The third-place play-off between losing semi-finalists New Zealand and France takes places before the final.

'Trust the process' - Kildunne on World Cup final

England back row Alex Matthews, one of four players in the squad from the 2014 World Cup winning team, said: "This tournament feels different because of the amount of coverage, the number of fans supporting us each week, messages of support we receive daily and with it being at home in England.

"The support has been on another level and it's only going to continue to rise beyond the conclusion of this World Cup. We can't thank the supporters enough for their incredible backing."

England second row Morwenna Talling, who was 12 when England triumphed in France in 2014, said: "It was so inspirational to see female rugby players achieving something with their country. 

"We are now in that spotlight and hold a responsibility as Red Roses to inspire young girls and boys to take an interest in our sport, whether watching or playing, and we hope that our sport continues to raise its profile following on from this World Cup."

England centre Meg Jones, who has been nominated for World Rugby women's 15s player of the year, added: We've had to fight for every second of game time in this tournament. We've earned the right to be here. 

"To run out at Allianz Stadium, knowing the stories we all carry, the communities we represent, and the history we're creating â that's massive. That's what makes this final week so powerful."

England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'

England's Ellie Kildunne is the face of the tournament, and she bounced back from missing the quarter-final win over Scotland after a concussion injury by delivering in fine style against France.

The full-back hit her stride with two superb tries at Ashton Gate, having only flickered briefly in her two previous outings at this World Cup.

She was also sporting eye-catching cheetah-print footwear from her boot sponsor for the first time, and has been prominent in much of the advertising for the tournament.

Canada standout Sophie de Goede is a rugby rarity as a goal-kicking lock forward, and with 58 points she is the second-highest scorer in the World Cup so far.

The final offers her a chance to go past New Zealand's Braxton Sorensen-McGee, who has 59 points prior to the third-placed play-off against France that takes place before the final itself.

De Goede's 20 conversions are the most in the tournament, and the 26-year-old has also kicked one penalty and crossed for three tries.

The aim of the game is very simple: score more points than the other team over 80 minutes of play (two halves of 40 minutes).

You do this by scoring tries, conversions, drop-goals and penalties.

A try - for touching the ball to the ground in your opponent's in-goal area - is worth five points

A conversion - a kick after a try - is worth two points

A penalty kick - awarded for foul play - is worth three points

A drop-goal - a kick in open-play - is also worth three points

England are captained by Zoe Aldcroft. Born in Scarborough, the 28-year-old can play as a lock but has featured as a blind-side flanker in the past two matches. 

She missed the second and third pool stage games, having suffered a knee injury in the win over the United States that opened the tournament on 22 August. 

Aldcroft led England to the Women's Six Nations title earlier this year after taking over the captaincy from Marlie Packer in January.

Canada are led by centre Alex Tessier. This is the 32-year-old's third World Cup, and she has played for Exeter Chiefs since 2023. Tessier first captained Canada against England in the WXV1 tournament last October.

Why England's 'warrior queen' is the perfect captain

England are coached by former All Blacks boss John Mitchell. The 61-year-old New Zealander worked with the England men's team's forwards from 1997 to 2000, and was their defence coach from 2018 to 2021. He succeeded Simon Middleton as head coach of the women's team in 2023 and has won every game since taking over.

Canada's head coach is 38-year-old Frenchman Kevin Rouet. He joined the Canada women's set-up in 2019 as assistant coach and stepped up to succeed Sandro Fiorino in 2022.

Wing Jess Breach has crossed the whitewash six times for England, including a hat-trick in the thumping victory over Samoa. Prop forward Kelsey Clifford has scored five and Kildunne four.

New Zealand's 18-year-old full-back Braxton Sorensen-McGee is the tournament's top scorer with nine so far, and could add to her total in the third-place play-off match against France.

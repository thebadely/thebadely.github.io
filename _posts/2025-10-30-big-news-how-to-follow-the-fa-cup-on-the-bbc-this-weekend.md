Hereâ€™s what you need to know: FA Cup first-round weekend is almost upon us - and you can keep tabs on all of the action across the BBC.

Two matches - those hosted by National League sides Brackley Town and Eastleigh - will be shown live on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Brackley have made it to the second round on four occasions - including last season, when they were knocked out by League One side Stockport County.

Eastleigh will be aiming to replicate their run from 2023-24, when they beat Reading on the way to reaching the third round.

There will be eight ties shown live on television, and all will be available on TNT Sports.

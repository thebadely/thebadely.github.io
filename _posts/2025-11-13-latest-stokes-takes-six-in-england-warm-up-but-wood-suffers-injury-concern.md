Here’s what you need to know: Captain Ben Stokes removed five of the Lions' top six

Tour match, Lilac Hill, Perth (day one of three)

England Lions 382: Jacks 84, McKinney 67; Stokes 6-52

England XI: yet to bat

Scorecard

Ben Stokes took six wickets in his first action since July but England suffered an injury concern over Mark Wood on the first day of their Ashes warm-up against England Lions in Perth.

Stokes, returning after almost four months out with a shoulder injury, bowled 16 overs across three spells for his 6-52 against England Lions â all to catches on the leg side.

Fast bowler Mark Wood, himself returning after nine months out with a knee injury, bowled a pre-planned number of eight overs before leaving the field in the afternoon session because of a hamstring problem. He will have a scan on Friday.

Wood's injury sucked the intensity out of the day, as the Lions were bowled out for 382 on a slow, low surface after an uncontested toss at Lilac Hill.

England wanted to field first to get overs in their legs before the first Ashes Test at Optus Stadium, beginning on 21 November.

In a possible hint towards their first-Test plans, the tourists fielded an all-pace attack â four specialists plus Stokes â and left off-spinner Shoaib Bashir in the Lions.

Jacob Bethell failed to press his case for inclusion in the Test side, making only two, but Will Jacks enhanced his claim to be called upon later in the tour by swiping 84.

Ben McKinney, Jordan Cox, 17-year-old Thomas Rew and Matthew Potts also made half-centuries.

England's plan to play a solitary warm-up game against the Lions has been questioned by some former players but Stokes hit back by calling the critics "has-beens".

A relaxed opening day in front of a smattering of spectators at Lilac Hill was certainly a world away from what England will face at a sold-out Optus Stadium next week.

Music played from the dressing rooms all day and England team analyst Rupert Lewis ran the drinks. After Bethell was dismissed batting for the Lions, he acted as a sub fielder for England. The tourists were subject to the occasional heckle from the home supporters.

One reason England play a limited number of warm-up matches is the difficulty of replicating Test conditions. The achingly slow pitch at a club ground is probably not the best preparation for playing at the Optus.

Wood's injury is a huge concern. England plan for him to bowl again on Saturday, but that will surely depend on the results of Friday's scan.

As ever, the headliner was Stokes. Even in such low-key surroundings, he re-affirmed his position as England's talisman.

Stokes was superb in the series against India in the home summer, only to push himself to breaking point. He missed the final Test with a torn shoulder.

The captain has not managed a full part in any of England's past four series because of various injuries and the tourists' hopes of regaining the Ashes are vastly diminished if he misses any of the five Tests in Australia.

He has been bowling at full pace for two months and looked in fine shape on Wednesday, even if he could not believe the way in which some of his wickets were gifted.

From first-change, Stokes had a spell in each session of the day. He had Lions captain Tom Haines miscue to mid-on with the fifth ball he bowled then Bethell, who spent 15 balls on nought, pulled to square leg.

Cox sparkled for his 53 only to find Wood at long leg in Stokes' afternoon stint. Rehan Ahmed fell in almost identical fashion.

When Stokes returned late in the day, Tom Lawes picked out Ollie Pope in the leg-side ring before the aggressive Jacks found Jofra Archer at fine leg.

Will Jacks hit eight fours and three sixes in his 84 off 85 balls

Jacks is unlikely to feature in the first Test â England look to have revealed their hand with the XI named here. Still, he may have nudged himself ahead of the out-of-sorts Bethell with his 84, which came at almost a run a ball.

Even before the doubt over Wood, the five seamers in the England XI for this game may not have been the attack for the first Test.

Brydon Carse missed the first day because of illness, with his place going to Josh Tongue. Tongue had Lions opener McKinney caught behind just after lunch.

Though Stokes took the wickets, Archer caught the eye. He was lively with the new ball and again after lunch, when he discomforted Jacks.

In the absence of Bashir and with Wood leaving the field, Joe Root was asked to bowl 14 overs of his off-spin. It was mediocre fare, costing 117 runs at an economy of more than eight.

Root at least claimed a wicket in the closing stages when Matt Fisher somehow hit a full toss to mid-on before Archer bounced out Potts for 53 with the final ball of the day.

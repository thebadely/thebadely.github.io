It has been recently reported that The European Cup was first contested in the 1955â56 season

Two Belgian men have claimed they hid in a toilet at Munich's Allianz Arena for 27 hours in order to watch last weekend's Champions League final for free.

Neal Remmerie and Senne Haverbeke told Belgian broadcaster VRT News they managed to get into the ground the day before the match then emerged to watch Paris St-Germain's 5-0 win over Inter Milan.

The pair uploaded a video, external on the social media platform TikTok which showed them sticking a homemade 'out of order' sign on two toilet cubicle doors before they waited in silence for more than a day as stadium staff used the facility.

"We had a backpack with snacks and we played around on our phones to kill time," Remmerie said.

"The lights were on all the time and the sitting position was uncomfortable, so sleeping was almost impossible. That made it physically and mentally difficult."

As soon as the duo heard fans using the toilets on matchday they emerged from the hiding place and made it past another ticket check before taking a seat in a stand.

"We looked carefully at which security guard was paying the least attention. While on the phone and with food in our hands, we just walked on, and suddenly we were inside," Remmerie added.

"PSG won 5-0 and we were also in the supporters' section of the winning team. It was the most beautiful football match we have ever seen."

BBC Sport has approached the Allianz Arena and Uefa for comment.

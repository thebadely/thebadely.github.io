'Devastated' Rooney pays tribute to Ricky Hatton

Ricky Hatton "captured the nation" and his death is "devastating", says former Manchester United and England forward Wayne Rooney.

Fomer world champion Hatton was found dead at the age of 46 at his home in Manchester on Sunday.

Rooney, 39, carried Hatton's belts into the ring before the boxer's victory over Jose Luis Castillo in Las Vegas in 2007.

"Ricky was such a good lad and a good person," the ex-footballer said on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show.

"He is someone who captured the nation, in terms of the support he got, they followed him all around the world.

"I want to pay my condolences to his family and everyone who is really close to him. It is way too soon."

Rooney said he was told the news of Hatton's death just after playing in a Manchester United legends exhibition match in South Korea.

"It has not fully kicked in," he added. "It's devastating. Heartbreaking.

"I am sure over the next few days from everyone across the country we will see a lot of messages and people will understand what a true gentleman and good person he was."

Rooney was 21 when he helped carry Hatton's championship belts into the ring alongside legendary Mexican boxer Marco Antonio Barrera before the Castillo fight.

"It was one of the most nervous I have ever been,"  said Rooney.

"I was in the pool all day in Vegas, it was hot, and my face got a bit burnt, but then I remember standing in the dressing room and being nervous.

"He hadn't lost at that time. I was thinking, 'He does not lose tonight. Is it on you? Is it your fault?'"

Hatton went on to retain his IBO light welterweight crown with a stunning fourth-round knockout.

Rooney said they went to a beach party afterwards with family and had "a great day".

He added: "So often you see any type of celebrity who are not really relatable, but Ricky was certainly relatable and good fun to be around."

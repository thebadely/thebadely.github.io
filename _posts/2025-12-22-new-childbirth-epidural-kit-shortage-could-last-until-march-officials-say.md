It has been recently reported that A shortage of epidural kits in the UK is expected to last until at least March, officials have warned.

Healthcare providers received a patient safety alert earlier this month that the shortage followed manufacturing issues concerning epidural bags.

Hospitals are being sent substitutes bags for the pain relief drug given to women in labour, while the Royal College of Anaesthetists is working with the NHS to advise hospitals on how to manage the situation.

Medical staff have expressed concern about these plans, the BBC understands, though the NHS said women "should come forward for care as usual".

The shortage arose after a major supplier stopped making epidural infusion bags, it is understood.

The alert on 2 December said there was a "range of alternative" bags available during the "affected period", which will require a "trust-wide approach to ensure safe implementation".

Hospitals are being sent substitutes - but these have higher drug doses and so need very careful managing.

All trusts have been asked to create teams that ensure mother-and-baby safety.

But hospital staff, pharmacists and anaesthetists - who administer epidurals to women during labour - have expressed concerns over the plans.

The head of the Birth Trauma Association, Dr Kim Thomas, argued that "there hasn't been enough communication" on how to put together these teams.

"Leaving trusts to manage a situation like this is very unfair, because you're going to get different responses in different trusts," she explained. 

"It's going to mean added stress and added work for staff who are already overworked particularly at this time of year."

An NHS spokesperson said: "The safety of women in the care of NHS maternity services remains a top priority."

They added: "There are a range of alternatives available and trusts are also sharing supplies with other nearby trusts where appropriate."

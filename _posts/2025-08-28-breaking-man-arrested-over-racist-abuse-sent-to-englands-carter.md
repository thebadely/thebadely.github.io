Let's dive into the details: A man has been arrested over "disgusting and appalling" racist abuse sent over social media to England footballer Jess Carter.

Police began investigating after receiving reports that the messages had been sent to the 27-year-old defender during the UEFA Women's Euros in July. 

A 59-year-old man from Great Harwood was arrested earlier by Lancashire Police on suspicion of malicious communications and has since been released under investigation.

Chief Constable Mark Roberts of Cheshire Police, which led the investigation, said the messages sent to Carter were "appalling" and "nobody should be subjected to such racist abuse". 

Carter, from Warwick, said she was taking a step back from social media after she was targeted with online racism during the tournament.

After the messages, the UK Football Policing Unit launched an investigation involving social media companies to track down those responsible.

"I would like to commend her for standing up to this abuse and assisting with our investigation," Mr Roberts said.

He is also the National Police Chief Council lead for football policing, and said he expected the arrest to be "the first of many over the coming months".

He said: "We want to make it clear that racist abuse of this nature will not be tolerated. 

"Everyone is responsible for what they do and say, and we want to ensure offenders cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments."

Lancashire Police has shared bodycam footage of the arrest at the man's home in Great Harwood.

PC Dan Fish from the force said: "Lancashire Police does not tolerate hate of any form, either in person or online."

He said he hoped the arrest sends out a message that police "will leave no stone unturned in identifying those who engage in such unacceptable behaviour â€“ no matter how long it takes".

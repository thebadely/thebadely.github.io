It has been recently reported that England, Canada, New Zealand and France are ranked one to four in the world respectively

Two matches and three teams separate England from Rugby World Cup glory.

The Red Roses will play France in Saturday's Rugby World Cup semi-final in Bristol, after Canada and New Zealand contest the other last-four match the previous evening.

After racking up winning margins in excess of 30 points in every match so far in the tournament, nerves and scorelines alike are expected to get tighter from this point on for England.

So, who are the other contenders for the crown?

New Zealand have won six of the seven Women's Rugby World Cup semi-finals they have contested

The six-time champions, as ever, seem to be timing their tilt to perfection.

The young talent of teenage superstar Braxton Sorensen-McGee, all-action flanker Jorja Miller and scrum-half Maia Joseph have refreshed a team that still contains the know-how of captain Ruahei Demant and living legend Portia Woodman-Wickliffe.

After their preparations for the last Rugby World Cup on home soil were disrupted by internal issues, coach Allan Bunting appears to have forged an impressive sense of collective purpose.

When it comes to New Zealand and the women's World Cup, there is a feeling of inevitability that bolsters their belief and undermines that of their rivals. England especially. The Red Roses have lost all five finals they have contested against New Zealand.

However, there are chinks in their armour.

New Zealand were troubled by South Africa's ultra-physical approach in the first half of their quarter-final, with the Springboks making metres with 15-player driving mauls and forward thrusts around the fringes.

England have the forward grunt to make similar inroads. Early on could be the time to make hay as well.

The win over South Africa was the second match that New Zealand have started slowly. Japan also caught the Black Ferns cold, exposing a narrow defence to score the first try before being blown away 62-19.

Canada held a fundraising drive titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup to cover the cost of their pre-tournament training camp

Canada are closest to runaway world number ones England in the rankings.

They have embellished those spreadsheet credentials with their deeds on the pitch too. They beat New Zealand for the first time in their history last year, prevailing 22-19 to clinch the Pacific Four Series.

And they backed up that result with a 27-27 draw against the Black Ferns in Christchurch four months ago.

Almost half of their squad have honed their game in England's PWR and all of them are smart, all-court rugby players.

The back three of Julia Schell, Alysha Corrigan and Asia Hogan-Rochester work, outside a classy one-two punch centre combination of Alex Tessier and Florence Symonds.

Second row Sophie De Goede captains her country, just as both of her parents did. The 26-year-old Saracen, who has only recently recovered from a serious knee injury, was immense in the quarter-final win over Australia, kicking goals, pulling strings and popping up all over the pitch.

The dedicated training camp that a C$1m (Â£530,000) fundraising drive - titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup â helped pay for has produced a more cohesive, connected group.

Head coach Kevin Rouet has accused his team of being "too Canadian" â lacking the killer instinct to put matches beyond teams.

Scotland have come closest to Canada so far in the tournament and England coach John Mitchell will have noted how Evie Gallagher and Fran McGhie both scored tries with cleverly angled runs, close to the breakdown.

Joanna Grisez streaked away for a breakaway score to break Irish hearts

Before England can contemplate either New Zealand or Canada, they must find a way past France.

Based on the way the Red Roses swatted aside France on their own turf in a 40-6 win in their final Rugby World Cup warm-up, that should be straightforward.

But France have a habit of raising their game for the big stage and a stomach for the fight.

They ran England to within a point in the final round of the Six Nations earlier this year, with a second-half comeback ending in a too-close-for-comfort 43-42 win for the Red Roses.

Against Ireland in the quarter-finals, they succeeded where they failed at Allianz Stadium. France gave up 13 unanswered points to Ireland in the first half, but rallied in the second half to claim an 18-13 win.

Pauline Bourdon-Sansus is perhaps the finest scrum-half in the women's game and drove her team on with tempo from the base. Meanwhile, wings Kelly Arbey and Joanna Grisez have both scored superb tries against England in the past.

Whether France can hold their own up front is another thing. Five of England's six tries came from the forwards in the team's most recent meeting and France need a vast improvement to even have parity in the pack.

It has been recently reported that Michelle Agyemang made her England debut against Belgium in April

Brighton have re-signed England striker Michelle Agyemang on loan from Arsenal for the 2025-26 Women's Super League campaign.

Agyemang played a key role in helping the Lionesses to win Euro 2025 and was named Young Player of the Tournament.

The 19-year-old is a graduate of Arsenal's academy but spent last season on loan with the Seagulls, scoring five goals in 22 appearances across all competitions.

"What she achieved during the summer with England was incredible but not surprising," Brighton head coach Dario Vidosic said. 

"She has the character, work ethic and relentless nature of a champion. As a club, we're incredibly proud of her.

"She was a pivotal part of our record-breaking season last year and we're excited for what this new season looks like with her in our attack." 

Agyemang made her senior debut for Arsenal in 2022 but has been unable to secure a regular role in the first team - featuring just six times in all competitions.

It has been a whirlwind four months for Agyemang since coming off the bench to score within 41 seconds on her England debut against Belgium in April.

Agyemang, who was a ball girl for England's World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland in 2021, played 138 minutes of football at Euro 2025 and did not start a single match but was a huge asset for head coach Sarina Wiegman.

Goals from the bench in the quarter-final against Sweden and in the semi-final against Italy forced extra time and gave England a platform for victory.

Her exploits in Switzerland have led to a nomination for the women's Kopa Trophy - awarded to the best under-21 female footballers in the world.

Agyemang was also on the shortlist for last season's WSL Rising Star award after helping Brighton to finish fifth.

Returning to the south coast offers a greater opportunity for consistent first-team football - as Arsenal, who ended last season second in the WSL, are unlikely to offer a guaranteed starting spot.

"We're so proud of Michelle's achievements this summer and throughout her journey at Arsenal, from her first steps in our academy through to our first-team squad," Arsenal's director of women's football Clare Wheatley said.  

"After discussing closely with Michelle and her family, we have all agreed that this move will provide Michelle with a further opportunity to develop and grow, as she continues to progress as a young player and person. 

"We wish Michelle every success at Brighton and look forward to welcoming her back to Arsenal at the end of her loan."

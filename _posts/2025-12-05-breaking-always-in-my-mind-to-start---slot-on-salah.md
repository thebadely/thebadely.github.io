Here’s what you need to know: Mohamed Salah has played 45 minutes of football in Liverpool's past two league games

Liverpool boss Arne Slot says Mohamed Salah is "always in my mind" after the Egypt forward was left out of the past two starting line-ups.

Salah, 33, has scored just four times during Liverpool's disappointing start to the Premier League season and has played only 45 minutes in the past two games.

Sources have told BBC Sport that the Saudi Pro League remains interested in signing Salah, who signed a new two-year contract in April.

"I think for every player in my mind can start and Mo is an exceptional player for us," said Slot on Friday.

"He is always in my mind to either start or to come off the bench."

Salah scored 29 times as Liverpool won the title in Slot's first season in charge last campaign.

But he was an unused substitute when Liverpool returned to winning ways at West Ham last Sunday, and again started from the substitutes' bench for Wednesday's 1-1 home draw against Sunderland.

It remains to be seen if Salah will return to the side for Saturday's match at Leeds United (17:30 GMT).

Asked if he understands the talk around Salah after being dropped, Slot added: "The chatter, yes because he deserves that, he has been so influential for me and six or seven years. 

"It's completely normal people talk about it when he isn't playing." 

Salah was strongly linked with Al-Ittihad before agreeing a new deal with Liverpool which runs until 2027.

Since joining the Reds in 2017, Salah has scored 250 goals in 420 Liverpool appearances in all competitions.

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk said this week that Slot's decision to drop Salah serves as proof that no-one has "unlimited credit" at the club.

"He is still a fantastic player and we still have to remember there is a reason why he has been so successful at the club and we have to respect that," Van Dijk said after the Sunderland draw.

"I need him around as one of the leaders. I'm not worried. He's disappointed but that's absolutely normal as if you're not disappointed when you're not playing two games in a row then there is an issue as well. 

"That's always been the case [that no-one is undroppable]. It's not like you have unlimited credit, everyone has to perform."

Liverpool start the weekend ninth in the table, 11 points behind leaders Arsenal, after just two wins in their past nine league games.

The question marks around Mohamed Salah's future will only grow if Arne Slot leaves him out of the starting 11 for the third game in a row.

Ahead of Saturday's trip to Leeds, Slot did not give any guarantees but simply said that he understands the chatter about Salah getting benched and that the Egyptian is "always in my mind to either start or come in."

Salah's record against Leeds is phenomenal with nine goals in six Premier League matches but this season, the 33-year-old is averaging a goal every 280 minutes in the top-flight.

Compare that to last term when he averaged a goal every 117 minutes and the drop-off is clear. Liverpool are struggling this season and so is Salah.

The likelihood is that Salah will start at Elland Road but come the end of next weekend, he will be on his way to the Africa Cup of Nations.

And if Liverpool find a return to winning ways during that time, then perhaps the blueprint for life after Salah will be established.

Either way, it's a fascinating subplot in a season where Liverpool find themselves with a lot more questions than answers.

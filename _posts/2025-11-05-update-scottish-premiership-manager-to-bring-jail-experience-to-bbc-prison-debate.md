Here’s what you need to know: David Martindale has become embedded in Livingston's recent history

Livingston manager David Martindale is happy to bring his "lived, real-life experience" to a debate about prison reform when he appears on BBC Scotland's Debate Night on Wednesday (21:00 GMT).

The Livingston manager, 51, was jailed for six-and-a-half years in 2006 after admitting drugs and money laundering charges.

Martindale will be joined on the panel of the Question Time-style show in Bathgate by two MSPs, an MP and a journalist.

After graduating from university and moving into football coaching following his release, the former Motherwell and Rangers youth player joined the Livi coaching staff in 2014 and became manager in 2020. 

He is the longest-serving manager among current Scottish top-flight bosses.

"It's obviously well out of my comfort zone," said Martindale about appearing on the programme. "I could sit and talk football with anybody every day of the week and I believe it would be quite an informed discussion. 

"Sitting with politicians, it's probably not my strongest skillset, but where I see the value for me is prison reform.

"I've got lived, real-life experience of spending time in prison, coming out, being rehabilitated. And I feel I've got quite an educated opinion on the prison system from being in it and living in it."

Martindale has given talks aimed at steering steer others away from re-offending.

"I still get requests on social media," he added. "I still get letters sent into the club. I've still done bits and bobs for prison reform, stuff like that.

"So, it's a part that I'll always make myself available for. I am pretty happy to talk about that because if it helps anyone, it's got to be a benefit. I'm more than happy to talk about my past, talk about my experiences."

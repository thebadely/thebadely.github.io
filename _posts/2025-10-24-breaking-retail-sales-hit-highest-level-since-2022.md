Here’s what you need to know: Retail sales hit their highest level since 2022 in September, with good weather giving a boost clothes shopping, according to new data.

Retail sales between July and September were 0.9% higher than the previous three months, new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows.

Retail sales rose by 0.5% on the month in September 2025, following a similar increase in August 2025.

Computer and telecoms retailers grew strongly, while within non-store retailing, online jewellers reported strong demand for gold.

ONS statistics are used in deciding government policy, which affects millions, and are also used by the Bank of England to make key financial decisions, such as setting interest rates.

According to new developments, In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko picks out the key takeaways from another enthralling Wimbledon.

That's it - Wimbledon is all over for another year.

As usual, the grass-court Grand Slam is one of the highlights of the British sporting calendar and the two weeks did not disappoint.

There were highs and lows, to and fros, tears of joy, tears of sorrow - and lots of cracking tennis.

Here are the main takeaways from the 2025 championships...

Sin-caraz here to stay

The level of shot-making and athleticism produced by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz as their fast-developing rivalry continued in the men's singles final was a joy to behold. 

Except, perhaps, if you're one of the guys trying to usurp them. The pair look set to maintain a stranglehold on the men's game for the foreseeable future.

Certainly it will take something extraordinary for somebody to prevent Sinner or Alcaraz winning the US Open and sweeping the Grand Slams for the second successive season.

Swiatek joins all-court greats

Few would have picked Iga Swiatek pre-tournament as their women's champion. 

But the 24-year-old Pole has now won majors on all the surfaces after needing just 57 minutes to beat Amanda Anisimova in a scarcely believable 6-0 6-0 win.

Despite a difficult year where she dropped down the rankings, Swiatek has reasserted some of her authority after becoming the youngest woman since Serena Williams in 2002 to win Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces.

Time catching up with Djokovic

In truth, this has been apparent for a while. Novak Djokovic has not won a major title since the 2023 US Open and it was widely accepted Wimbledon represented his best chance of breaking the Sinner-Alcaraz duopoly.

The 38-year-old Serb continues to defy the ageing process but losing to Sinner in the semi-finals - ending his bid for a standalone record 25th major title - was another indication he doesn't have enough in the tank to match the young guns. 

Humans versus technology

The ongoing topic of humans being made redundant by technology spilled over into Wimbledon. 

The All England Club replaced line judges with an electronic line-calling system, but had to apologise after the technology was turned off in error and missed three calls in one game.

At the start of the tournament, there were 23 Britons competing in the men's and women's singles - the highest tally since 1984.

Cameron Norrie and Sonay Kartal were the standout performers to reach the second week, emerging from the shadows of Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu.

A shock second-round exit showed Draper still has things to learn on the grass, while Raducanu proved she can push the very best in a narrow defeat by top seed Aryna Sabalenka.

In her Wimbledon column, BBC Sport analyst Naomi Broady - a former top-60 player on the WTA Tour - analysed what the leading British singles stars can learn from their performances.

There was a significant success for the home nation.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool became the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles in the Open era, showing on the biggest stage how they have developed into one of the world's leading teams.

While Sinner strengthened his grip at the top of the ATP rankings, there was a lot of movement below the new Wimbledon champion.

Russian Andrey Rublev regained his place in the top 10 after a run to the fourth round, while Italy's Flavio Cobolli - who reached his first major quarter-final - has cracked the top 20.

But the biggest climbers among the top 100 were Poland's Kamil Majchrzak and Chile's Nicolas Jarry.

Majchrzak reached a major fourth round having previously served a 13-month doping ban, while Jarry - who has an ear condition which affects his balance and vision - came through qualifying to reach the last 16.

On the flip side, former world number one Daniil Medvedev was the biggest faller in the top 20 after his shock first-round defeat.

Greece's three-time major finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas, France's huge-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut also dropped after losing in the first round.

In the WTA rankings, Swiatek has rejoined Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff in the top three, while runner-up Anisimova has broken into the top 10 for the first time.

Switzerland's Belinda Bencic continued sound progress in her comeback after having a baby. The former Olympic champion has returned to the top 20 by making the semi-finals.

Surprise quarter-finalist Laura Siegemund, 37, was the biggest climber in the top 100, with Russian Anastasia Pavlychenkova also jumping sharply.

Kartal, who lost to Pavlychenkova in the last 16, continued her rise by moving into a new career-high ranking of 44th. 

The biggest fallers are the surprise packages from last year who could not defend their mountain of rankings points.

The 2024 champion Barbora Krejcikova became tearful as she "lost all energy" in her third-round defeat and, after an injury-hit season, has dropped out of the top 70.

Italy's Jasmine Paolini was unable to back her run to last year's final, while Croatia's Donna Vekic - who reached the semi-final last year - lost in the second round.

Raducanu, despite her encouraging performances, loses her British number one status after falling short of her last-16 run 12 months ago.

While those who went deep at Wimbledon will unwind for a few days, those lower in the rankings are already back on the tours.

The short grass-court swing is over, with several clay-court events taking place across Europe this week.

Attention will quickly turn to the North American hard-court swing which begins later this month, with the first big event being the ATP-WTA combined Canadian Open.

According to new developments, Ben White scored his first goal of the season in the Carabao Cup win against Chelsea 

Arsenal's semi-final record under manager Mikel Arteta has not made for pretty reading.

But, after failing to win even one leg in their previous four two-legged semis, Arsenal's 3-2 win at Chelsea in the Carabao Cup has moved them one game away from a first major final since their FA Cup triumph in 2020.

The Gunners had lost their past four semi-finals over two legs, scoring just two goals in total, but will now be heavy favourites to end their semi-final nightmares at Emirates Stadium on 3 February.

Arteta's side have been excellent this season - top of both the Premier League and Champions League, and through to the FA Cup fourth round.

This game was Arsenal's 32nd of the season and they have only lost twice, both away from home to Liverpool and Aston Villa in the Premier League.

But Arteta and his players have the feeling that the margin of their win could have been even bigger before the second leg as they look to book themselves an early chance to lift a trophy in the EFL Cup final on 22 March.

"First of all, I have to praise the players for the performance, for the game that we just played against a really good opponent," said Arteta.

"With so much quality on that pitch, we had the feeling at the end after the 1-3 and the very dominant period that we had in that time, that we had two massive chances to score the fourth one and the result would have been very different.

"But in that moment they had an action, they created a corner, they scored a goal and it's game on. So that feeling is not perfect but as well we have to value what the team has done again."

Striker Viktor Gyokeres has not enjoyed the start to his Arsenal career he must have wanted since his Â£64m summer move from Sporting.

The Sweden forward had not scored since a penalty against Everton last month and his goal against Chelsea was his first from open play since November.

The 27-year-old has looked like he has been lacking in confidence in recent weeks, but his performance in this game looked much more like the player who scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting.

He also provided an assist for Martin Zubimendi who scored Arsenal's third goal to ensure they go into the second leg at the Emirates with a lead.

"That's what I need to do and I can do it more often. We won today and we keep going," Gyokeres said.

"It's still a second leg but of course it's good to come away with a win and advantage for the second leg - but we still have to do a good performance in the second match.

"I think it was a tough game. We defended well. They were, as always, dangerous when they have counter-attacks, but I think we defended well. Unfortunate to have conceded two but offensively we scored three, so happy with that."

When the Gunners were 2-0 up, it seemed as though they were able to score at will.

However, Alejandro Garnacho pulled a goal back for Chelsea to make it 2-1 to the visitors.

Zubimendi's excellent finish gave Arsenal a two-goal lead for the second time in the match, but again the Gunners let it slip with Garnacho's second.

Taking a two-goal lead to the Emirates where Arsenal have not lost all season would have put the Gunners in an extremely strong position, but Chelsea are still in this tie.

"We didn't play very well in the second half and let them give us more pressure," said goalscorer Ben White. 

"That's how we conceded the goals. Not up to our standards really. It's a bit disappointing, the second half, but a win."

However, despite the position of the tie and Arteta's perceived disappointment with the late part of the game, the Arsenal boss is focusing on their Premier League game at Nottingham Forest on Saturday (17:30 GMT).

"In 20 minutes I'm going to start thinking about Forest and start to prepare and make sure everybody recovers from that," said the Spaniard.

"That's the routine that we have. I'm very happy with what we've done tonight. Put it to bed and now focus on the next one."

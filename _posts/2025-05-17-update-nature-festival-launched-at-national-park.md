Hereâ€™s what you need to know: People are being urged to "connect with nature" at the launch of a two-week festival to celebrate Exmoor National Park.

The Exmoor Nature Festival runs from 17 May to 1 June and features activities including nature walks, art sessions and yoga.

The organisers said they hoped participants word be "inspired to help us look after this very special landscape".

Experts are also offering talks on topics such as fungi and bird life, while children have the chance to meet one of the park's famous Exmoor ponies.

Festival organiser, Julie Colman, rural enterprise co-ordinator at Exmoor National Park, said: "National Parks were created to help support the Nations' health and wellbeing and this is a real opportunity for everyone to connect with nature.

"Not only are people learning about Exmoor flora and fauna but hopefully being inspired to help us look after this very special landscape."

Information about the different events and activities are available on the Exmoor Nation Park website, and at its visitors' centres in Dulverton, Dunster and Lynmouth.

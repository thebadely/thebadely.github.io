Let's dive into the details: No player completed more than three holes on Saturday due to consistent rainfall

The LPGA Tour has cancelled the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship after 18 holes because of bad weather.

Dangerous conditions at the Pinnacle Country Club in Rogers, Arkansas, saw play suspended on Saturday with full cancellation of the event confirmed on Sunday.

"The course received 3.25 [inches] of rain last night and after having assessed the golf course and consulted with our meteorologist and superintendent, the golf course is unplayable," the LPGA said in a statement.

"Based on the weather forecast for the remainder of today and all day Monday and Tuesday, it is highly unlikely that 36 holes could be completed to make it an official event.

"As a result, the decision has been made to cancel the remainder of the tournament, with only players' 18-hole score counting."

The scheduled 54-hole event will be unofficial with no points awarded in the Race to CME globe, the season-long points competition.

Raducanu beats Shibahara for first US Open victory since 2021 title

US Open 2025

Venue: Flushing Meadows, New York Dates: 24 August-7 September

When Emma Raducanu found out she was scheduled to play one of the first matches on the US Open's new Sunday start, it brought a bit of added pressure.

The British number one went into the meeting with Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara having not won a match at Flushing Meadows since her memorable 2021 title triumph.

Despite a few morning nerves, Raducanu needed only 62 minutes to secure a 6-1 6-2 victory and register the quickest Grand Slam main-draw victory of her career.

"When I saw the Sunday schedule, I thought first day, first match at 11am - you don't want to be out of the tournament by 12:30pm on a Sunday," Raducanu, ranked 35th in the world, told BBC Sport.

"That definitely was on my mind.

"At the same time, if it goes well you get the afternoon off, which is really nice before your day off in between matches.

"I'm pleased I can enjoy the rest of my day and celebrate the win."

Raducanu returns to match action on Wednesday when she faces Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen.

Having secured the first completed victory of this year's tournament at 12:15 local time, Raducanu headed back to the practice courts at about 14:00.

New coach Francisco Roig, who agreed to join Raducanu's team earlier this month, worked on her forehand returns from the baseline in a light-hearted session lasting about half an hour.

Roig has become a vocal presence in her courtside box - although there was little guidance or input needed against world number 130 Shibahara.

But, with the match taking place on a noisy Louis Armstrong Stadium, Raducanu said it would not have mattered even if the Spaniard was trying to deliver instructions.

"You don't really hear it unless you're kind of lip-reading," she added.

"I probably don't take in much of what he's saying, but when I feel like I really need it, I will go over.

"For the most part, especially when you're in a match like today, I felt like I had most things under control on my side of the court."

Despite only working with each other for a few weeks, the pair appear to have already gelled.

Lengthy car journeys to the Cincinnati Open, with Roig taking driving duties, strengthened their bond, and he has since started teaching Raducanu some Spanish. 

"If anyone asks if I can say something in Spanish, I just bosh out some verb conjugations," she joked.

"It's not exactly the best conversation starter but I'm getting there."

Chiropractor Jerome Poupel, a Frenchman based in London, provides another voice in Raducanu's new-look team - as well as a quirky back story.

Poupel has previously worked with ex-Formula 1 driver David Coulthard and racing legend AP McCoy, as well as treating horses.

"I don't really know what he does with horses - I don't ask questions! It just seems to work on them," Raducanu said.

"I am a horse on my horoscope so I don't know if that has any correlation."

Emma Raducanu is ranked 35th in the world and narrowly missed out on a US Open seeding

Returning to the scene where she shocked the world as a teenage qualifier has previously been a burden for 22-year-old Raducanu.

Chastening first-round defeats in 2022 and 2024 came either side of missing the 2023 tournament through injury.

This year she is back in New York with improved form and renewed vigour.

Raducanu has won more WTA Tour-level matches this year than ever before and climbed to the cusp of the top 30 in the world rankings.

A series of injuries over the past four years, combined with the mental load of such frenzied attention, has meant Raducanu is only now seeing the US Open as her "happy place".

Since arriving in New York last weekend, she has cut a jovial figure - particularly during her outing alongside Carlos Alcaraz in the revamped mixed doubles event.

Feeling more relaxed and carefree off court is how she feels she can best fulfil her potential on it.

"I thought it was a very clean performance, especially for the first round where there are nerves," admitted Raducanu.

"I broke a barrier of not winning a match here for four years.

"It is a relief. I'm happy to have stopped that and feel I can keep going without that in my head."

Experts revealed that Government sources have told the Guardian that the British-Egyptian activist, Alaa Abd El Fattah, will not be stripped of his citizenship in the UK because his social media posts do not meet the legal bar for such a sanction. 

Opposition parties are keeping up the pressure on the government to act with the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, quoted in the the Daily Telegraph. He describes Mr Abd El Fattah as a "hatemonger".

The Times leads on a report that Britain has suffered the worst investment levels in the G7. 

Latest figures show that public and private investment stood at 18.8% of GDP in the three months to September. 

The Daily Mail reports that police forces in England and Wales are preparing for a surge "in all crime types" because of plans to jail fewer criminals under sentencing reforms. 

A police source says there could be "some absolute horror stories" in terms of reoffending. 

A government spokesperson said reform would come alongside the building of 14,000 additional prison places and investment in probation and electronic monitoring.

According to the Sun, the boxer, Anthony Joshua, is in pain all over his body, after being involved in a car crash in Nigeria. 

The Daily Star reports that he is being treated at the country's "best private hospital" in Lagos where suites for VIPs start at £2,000. 

His mother, Yeta Odusanya, is by his side as he recovers. "We're in AJ's corner", is the Daily Mirror's headline.

The Guardian and the i Paper both feature pictures of stranded passengers caught up in the Channel Tunnel delays. 

The i Paper says the "chaos" raises doubts about plans to expand cross-Channel services as its the "third time in as many years" there has been festive disruption. 

Those hoping to go to Paris or Brussels, says the Daily Express, instead found themselves on "the road to Rouen".

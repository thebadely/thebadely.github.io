Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Abi Tierney became the first female WRU chief executive when appointed in January 2024

Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Abi Tierney will step away from her role after being diagnosed with cancer.

Tierney will take time away from her duties from 22 August to undergo treatment, with no return date given.

"This has not been an easy decision, but it is one I must make to focus fully on my health and recovery," she said.

"I am grateful for the support I have already received from my family, friends, and colleagues, and I am confident in the team's ability to continue our work during my absence. 

"I kindly ask for understanding and privacy during this time."

Chair Richard Collier-Keywood will take temporary overall charge of the governing body.

Tierney took over the position in January 2024 and has overseen a turbulent time in Welsh rugby.

Collier-Keywood said: "Everyone involved with Welsh rugby wish Abi well over this period and the WRU is committed to supporting her during this time.

"In my role as chair, I will continue to have overall responsibility for the WRU and in order to provide cover and give Abi the space she needs, will be more involved in the immediate future. 

"Abi and the board have recruited a strong executive team which will continue to lead the WRU on a day-to-day basis."

Tierney's absence comes as the Welsh domestic game is being reviewed with the WRU considering cutting the number of professional sides from four to two.

Collier-Keywood and director of rugby and elite performance Dave Reddin will now oversee that process.

The WRU is expected to deliver its preferred solution imminently, to be followed by a six-week consultation before a final decision due in October.

"The most important topic on our agenda right now is the consultation on the future of elite rugby in Wales," said Collier-Keywood.

"This will be led by Dave Reddin, as a member of the executive, and I will take overall responsibility for its successful delivery.

"We will be working closely with board members including Malcolm Wall as chair of the Professional Rugby Board, Amanda Bennett who leads at board level on our women's game and Andrew Williams."

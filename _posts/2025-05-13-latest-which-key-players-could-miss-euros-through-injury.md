Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Netherlands' Vivianne Miedema, England's Lauren James and Wales' Sophie Ingle are hoping to be fit for Euro 2025

Euro 2025 is just around the corner, with the first match kicking the tournament in Switzerland off on 2 July.

With squads expected to be confirmed in early June, injured players face a race against time to prove their fitness.

But which key players are at risk of missing out on the 16-team tournament? BBC Sport has been taking a look.

23 years old, 27 caps

Forward Lauren James suffered a hamstring injury midway through England's 5-0 win over Belgium in April and there is no timeline for her return.

James, who has earned plaudits for her physicality, confidence and game-changing creativity, has scored seven goals in 27 appearances for England, including three goals and three assists at the 2023 Women's World Cup.

England's Georgia Stanway hasn't played since December 2024 because of a knee injury

26 years old, 75 caps

Georgia Stanway was one of four players to start every match as England won Euro 2022 while she also helped the Lionesses reach the final of the 2023 World Cup, and has scored 21 goals in 75 caps.

She suffered a lateral collateral ligament tear (LCL) in her right knee in training with Bayern Munich in January and has since undergone surgery. She hasn't played a competitive match since December, but is back in training.

33 years old, 139 caps

The Chelsea midfielder, who will be leaving the Blues this summer, hasn't featured this season after damaging her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a pre-season victory over Feyenoord. Ingle, who captained Wales for nine years, is their most experienced player after Jess Fishlock and has a long-standing partnership with Angharad James-Turner in the centre of the midfield.

She told BBC Sport in February that she is "on track" for Euro 2025 while in March, Chelsea manager Bompastor issued a positive update, stating she is "in a really good place" and her "rehab is going well".

23 years old, 51 caps

Lena Oberdorf was named young player of the tournament as Germany reached the final of Euro 2022 and started every game at the 2023 World Cup.

However, the 23-year-old, a physical holding midfielder who already has over 50 international caps, hasn't played for nearly a year after suffering a cruciate and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury in her knee in July 2024. The injury ruled her out of the 2024 Olympics and has delayed her Bayern Munich debut. She has returned to training but is "not at the level needed for a European Championship", Bayern's director Bianca Rech told German media recently. 

28 years old, 124 caps

Vivianne Miedema suffered a hamstring injury during the Netherlands' Nations League victory over Austria in early April. Manchester City's interim manager Nick Cushing later confirmed she would likely miss the remainder of the Women's Super League season but did not comment on her chances of playing at the Euros.

Miedema, who also missed the 2023 World Cup through injury, is the Netherlands' all-time leading goalscorer with 97 goals in 124 appearances, meaning her absence would be a significant blow.

35 years old, 178 caps

Centre-back Maren Mjelde hasn't featured for club side Everton since 30 March after picking up an unspecified injury before Norway's Nations League fixtures at the beginning of April.

Mjelde, who has amassed 178 caps, was a member of the squad which reached the final of the Euros in 2013 and started all four of Norway's matches at the 2023 World Cup.

Kika Nazareth scored the equaliser as Portugal drew with England in February

22 years old, 43 caps

Barcelona forward Kika Nazareth was ruled out for four months in mid-March after undergoing surgery on damaged ligaments in her left ankle and is not expected to be available for Portugal.

The 22-year-old, who joined Barcelona from Benfica last summer, has scored 10 goals in 43 senior appearances, most recently coming off the bench to score the equaliser during Portugal's 1-1 draw with England in February.

29 years old, 54 caps

Defender Luana Buhler hasn't played since mid-March due to an unspecified injury but Tottenham manager Robert Vilahamn has been positive about her recovery. "She's on grass now, with her studs on and running but not with the collective group. Plan is to get her back for the Euros and it looks like a good possibility she will be," he said on 8 May. 

Buhler, who has earned more than 50 international caps, enjoyed a successful partnership with Viola Calligaris at the centre of defence in qualifying, with Switzerland conceding just three goals in six matches.

Real Madrid midfielder Teresa Abelleira's absence will be a big blow for Spain

25 years old, 44 caps

Teresa Abelleira suffered a ruptured ACL in her left knee in February while training at Wembley before Spain's Nations League match against England. Real Madrid later confirmed she had undergone surgery in March. 

The central midfielder started every game when Spain won the World Cup in 2023 and was also part of their 2024 Nations League-winning squad.

It has been recently reported that Zheng Qinwen beat Donna Vekic in the final in Paris to win Olympic women's singles gold in 2024 

Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen is taking a "short break" from the WTA Tour after having arthroscopic surgery on her right elbow. 

The 22-year-old Chinese player was fifth seed at this year's Wimbledon, but lost in the first round and said she had been "dealing with persistent pain". 

"Now begins the recovery journey," the world number six wrote on Instagram. 

"Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be focusing entirely on rehab - doing everything I can to come back stronger and healthier.

"This is just a short break and I see it as a necessary step toward a better version of myself on court."

Zheng underwent the procedure on Friday and was "grateful to have it behind me".

She won the women's singles title at the Paris Olympics in 2024 and claimed the last of her five WTA titles at the Pan Pacific Open in Japan in October of that year. 

Zheng has never won a Grand Slam title, but reached the 2024 Australian Open final, the quarter-finals of the US Open twice and the last eight of this year's French Open.

The fourth and final major of the year begins at Flushing Meadows in New York on 24 August.

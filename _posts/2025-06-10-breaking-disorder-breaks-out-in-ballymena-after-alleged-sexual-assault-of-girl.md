Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Police have appealed for calm after disorder broke out in Ballymena, following a protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town. 

Masked youths could be seen throwing masonry and a number of properties were damaged with windows smashed.

At least two houses were set on fire, according to the Belfast Telegraph.

Officers blocked off Clonavon Terrace as they tried to tackle the unrest while a police car appeared to have its windows smashed.

In a statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said a number of missiles wee thrown at its officers and "damage had reported to a number of properties".

Police have advised motorists and pedestrians to avoid Clonavon Road until further notice.

Ch Supt Sue Steen said: "We are urging everyone to remain calm and to act responsibly. Violence and disorder will only place people at greater risk". 

Social media footage appeared to show a masked man throwing an object at police vans as a crowd looked on. 

Black smoke filled the air as flames erupted close to a house that had its windows smashed.

The unrest follows a protest in the town, about 30 miles from Belfast, earlier in the evening.

Earlier, two teenage boys appeared before Coleraine Magistrates' Court accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl in the County Antrim town. 

A protest of hundreds of people in Ballymena happened hours after the court appearance. 

The crowd of men, women and children gathered close to the town centre and marched peacefully along Larne Street and then Queen Street.

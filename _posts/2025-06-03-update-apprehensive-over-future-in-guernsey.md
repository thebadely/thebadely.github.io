It has been recently reported that "I just don't know if I'm going to be able to afford to live here," says Myles Duquemin.

"Like many, many young people here now who are just looking for a way out."

His words echo those of a new study by the Guernsey Community Foundation (GCF) which found young people do not see a future in the island and are being "driven away" by rising living costs. 

The report is the first of its kind and makes a number of observations based on previously published data and a survey of 3,000 islanders.

Myles says his family has lived on the island for "longer than anyone can probably remember".

"It doesn't make me feel great, all my family are here. A lot of my friends have already left," he said.

"If I leave the island now, I might not ever come back because I won't be able to afford to."

Lilleth Tolley was raised in Guernsey and is currently studying digital forensic investigation at university in Stoke.

She said coming back to Guernsey when she has finished studying was "not realistic" because of the cost of living.

Property prices on the island are "just completely unaffordable to the average person", she added.

The average rental property in Guernsey is Â£2,037 a month, and people renting are paying 50% more than five years ago.

"A lot of the public don't realise how bad it is," said Lilleth. 

"Parents want their kids out at 18 to give their kids independence. Their kids want to be out and have independence."

A lot of Lilleth's friends were originally planning on staying in Guernsey but now there are "serious conversations going on" and "people making plans and saving up to move to the UK".

Here’s what you need to know: The half-time show took place on an enormous stage attached to the top tier of the MetLife Stadium

It was more like the build-up to the Super Bowl than a football match between two of Europe's biggest clubs.

The countdown to Sunday's Club World Cup final between Chelsea and European champions Paris St-Germain was colourful, captivating and possibly a little confusing for football fans outside the USA.

A military colour guard, a dramatic flyover and a performance from Robbie Williams - all in front of US president Donald Trump - were just some of the pre-match highlights at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

There was so much going on, in fact, that the game itself only got under way at 20:08 BST - eight minutes after its scheduled kick-off time.

On the pitch, Chelsea produced a stunning performance to beat PSG 3-0 and upset the odds.

Off the pitch? BBC Sport tries to make sense of it all.

Officially, Sunday's pre-match action was divided into three parts.

After the 'countdown to the final' - featuring, among other things, a drumming display and a huge inflatable model of the Club World Cup trophy - Williams and pop star Laura Pausini performed Fifa's new official anthem, Desire.

This was followed by a tribute to the tournament hosts, including the US national anthem, a colour guard, a military flyover and a dazzling firework display.

When the two sets of players had finally entered the pitch, American ring announcer Michael Buffer delivered his iconic "let's get ready to rumble!" line before kick-off - as has been the case throughout the competition.

There was also a red carpet for celebrities, ex-players and politicians to enter the MetLife Stadium before the match, with notable attendees including American film director Spike Lee, former Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and pop star Rita Ora - as well as Trump.

There was plenty more to come at half-time.

Fifa's first half-time show included colourful performances from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and fellow singers J Balvin, Doja Cat and Tems - all on an enormous, high-tech stage that was built above the arena in the build-up to the final before being placed at the top of the stadium's upper tier, just under the roof.

This was to avoid damaging the pitch at the interval of such an important game.

It took six semi-trucks to delivery all the required material, including 40,000 pounds of gear, scenery and structural trusses.

Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the show delayed the kick-off to the second half. PSG's players stood around on the pitch while the show reached its conclusion, while Chelsea's only re-emerged a few minutes later.

The action eventually got back under way 24 minutes after the half-time whistle had sounded - but not before Trump had had his say.

Before PSG kicked off the second half, he spoke - very briefly - to DAZN reporter Emily Austin, saying: "I'm having a really great time. Tremendous sport."

When he wasn't being asked to share his thoughts on the beautiful game, Trump watched the action up in the stands alongside Fifa supremo Gianni Infantino.

Given that the final was played a year to the day since the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania, the heightened security at MetLife Stadium came as no surprise.

The United States Secret Service were armed and on location, with several snipers positioned on the roof of the MetLife Stadium.

Official sources were reluctant to confirm rumours that Trump was being prepared for an interview with DAZN, which was teased briefly at half-time and shown in full after full-time.

BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella said before kick-off: "It took twice as long for me to reach my position in the stadium with increased filtering and checks.

"There seems to be a more tense attitude from the security at the 82,500-seater arena."

The post-match action began in lively fashion as both sets of players became involved in a brawl after the final whistle, but once tempers had calmed, it was time for Messrs Trump and Infantino to hand out some awards.

Real Madrid's Gonzalo Garcia collected the top scorer prize, PSG's Desire Doue was named young player of the tournament, Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez picked up the golden glove award, while Cole Palmer - the Blues' two-goal hero in the final - was named the player of the tournament.

After the two sets of players had collected their medals, Trump and Infantino presented the Club World Cup trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James.

According to Fifa, the Club World Cup trophy is inspired by the periodic table and historic golden records sent into space aboard the Voyager probes.

It can also be 'opened' with a special key, which only Infantino is permitted to use.

Perhaps to the relief of captain James and his team-mates, the trophy was already in its 'open' position when it was handed to the Blues' skipper.

With Trump in close proximity, having positioned himself right in the middle of the Chelsea squad instead of exiting stage right, James lifted the enormous trophy into the East Rutherford sky as the celebrations began in earnest - nearly three hours after kick-off.

Experts revealed that The fall-out from the court injunction which means migrants have to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, is the lead for many.

The Mirror has spoken to a refugee from Somalia, Khadar Mohamed, who has been staying there, and quotes him as saying he is "living in fear". It reports that Mr Mohamed has said that the protests that have been held outside the hotel are "deepening the trauma of terrified residents".

The Daily Mail says at least four Labour-run authorities are understood to be studying the ruling and considering their own course, which the paper says poses a "new headache" for the prime minister.

 The Times names Tamworth and Wirral as two Labour-run authorities which it says are exploring legal action. According to the paper, a Labour MP has expressed support for closing asylum hotels "as quickly as possible". 

The i Paper says the Home Office is "scrambling" to find alternative accommodation and is pushing ahead with plans to use tower blocks and student residences. The Sun describes the issue as the prime minister's asylum "nightmare". "No vacancies" is its headline.

A warning from the education secretary that the majority of white, working-class children are falling short in English and Maths skills is the lead in the Telegraph. Bridget Phillipson has told the paper that there has been no improvement in the number of children in this group achieving a strong GCSE pass in the two subjects since 2017. She describes this as "appalling".

People appear to find everything slightly more enjoyable if they have company while they are doing it according to a study covered in the Times. Forty thousand Americans were asked questions about their mood and whether they were "interacting" with someone while carrying out an activity in four different years between 2010 and 2021. 

The paper says the researchers found with "remarkable consistency" that company was linked to better moods, even if the activity was something like reading, or just "thinking".

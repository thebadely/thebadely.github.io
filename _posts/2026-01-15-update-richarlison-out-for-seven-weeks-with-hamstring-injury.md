Experts revealed that Richarlison joined Tottenham from Everton in the summer of 2022

Tottenham forward Richarlison has been ruled out for up to seven weeks with a hamstring injury.

The 28-year-old is Spurs' top scorer this season with seven goals in 21 Premier League games.

Thomas Frank's side host West Ham in a London derby on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and have won just one of their past seven matches in all competitions.

They were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa at the weekend and are currently 14th in the top flight.

Midfielders Lucas Bergvall and Yves Bissouma are back available, while full-back Destiny Udogie and striker Dominic Solanke could be involved against the Hammers.

Spurs have signed England midfielder Conor Gallagher, 25, from Atletico Madrid for Â£35m with Frank hailing him as a "top signing" who is "exactly what we need".

"First and foremost he is a very good player, great experience in the Premier League, also in La Liga, captained teams," the Dane said.

"So that character, that leadership, that experience, and still young with plenty of development to reach, but coming in at a good level, bringing his pressing abilities, his directness, scoring goals, but also being able to find good positions on the pitch."

On Thursday Spurs announced former Netherlands and Everton defender John Heitinga has joined the club as an assistant coach.

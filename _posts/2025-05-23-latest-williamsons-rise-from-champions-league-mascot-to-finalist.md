'It's a full circle moment'

The last time Arsenal reached the Women's Champions League final, a 10-year-old Leah Williamson walked out as mascot alongside her heroes.

Fast forward 18 years and Williamson will take to the pitch for Saturday's showpiece event against Barcelona as one of the Gunners' key players.

Arsenal beat Swedish side Umea 1-0 that day at Meadow Park in the first and only time an English club has lifted the trophy.

"I remember Borehamwood rocking," Williamson told BBC Sport's Jo Currie. "I just remember there being people everywhere. I was annoyed I walked out with the away team which wasn't part of the plan.

"I remember watching with all my team-mates and in my head that was the most normal thing in the world - Arsenal were going to go and win, which I think is a beautiful thing to grow up with as a fan.

"It was a good day. I remember it for the club and for everybody. I just remember everyone being very happy which is what trophies do."

Williamson joined Arsenal at the age of eight and made her senior debut the day after her 17th birthday.

She has gone on to win seven major trophies, but to be crowned a European champion with her childhood club in a final 18 years in the making would complete her full-circle moment.

"It's so nice for me to reflect on," Williamson added. "I was never the kid that was like 'I'm going to be a professional footballer'. I kept following my feet and doing what I love.

"This is somewhere that I love. I'm proud I've been here that long and it's a nice moment for reflection. Life offers you those sometimes and I'm not one to waste time to not appreciate those moments."

Standing in Arsenal's way on Saturday are Europe's dominant force Barcelona, who are chasing a third successive Champions League title and a fourth in total.

Chelsea suffered a brutal 8-2 aggregate semi-final defeat by the Catalan giants and Williamson said Arsenal go into the game hoping their underdog status plays to their advantage.

"On paper I'm not surprised because it would be disrespectful to think any other way given what they have achieved in the last three years in the competition," she said.

"When we speak of Barcelona, everyone is very respectful and humble to what they are as a football club and what they have achieved. We are going [there] to win. It's not an underdog mentality in that sense. 

"Now the trophy is on offer and we have one game to go and do it. 100% we go there with the belief we will do it."

Saturday's game takes place at the 50,095 capacity Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon - home of men's side Sporting.

That in itself shows how far the game has come since Williamson walked out as mascot in front of 3,467 people at Meadow Park in 2007.

After captaining England to the European Championship title in 2022, Williamson believes victory for Arsenal in the Champions League would produce another spike in popularity in the domestic game.

"I think it would have a similar effect," she said. "I think the interest levels, the idea that you can come and watch your team who are up there with the best in the world. 

"Recently our English teams have done really well and got further and further, but to bring those nights and bring that success back to England would be an incredible achievement seeing as it has been so long.

"I'm very proud to play for a club that has such a rich history. As a player, when you are the person that walks out on to the pitch, you are responsible for the legacy that lives on past you behind the badge. 

"We want to be involved and we want to commit. We want to be part of that history and bring more success to the club and the name and what it deserves."

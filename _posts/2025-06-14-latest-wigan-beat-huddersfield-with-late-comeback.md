Wigan Warriors pulled off a last-gasp victory over Huddersfield Giants to close the gap on Hull KR at the top of Super League.

Luke Robinson's struggling Giants looked set to produce a major upset against the reigning champions and came within one play of only their second win of their campaign.

But with the clock showing just five seconds of time remaining, Jack Farrimond finished off a Hail Mary move to clinch the points.

Defeat was tough for the Giants to take after making most of the running against  below-par Wigan in blustery conditions at the Flair Stadium in Dewsbury, where the match was played because of a concert at Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium.

Tries from George Flanagan, George King and Joe Greenwood, all with added extra points, had given them a 18-16 lead going into the final play of the game.

But Farrimond's second try of the match, adding to tries from Liam Marshall and Jai Field, saw Wigan land the sucker punch to narrow the gap to Hull KR to two points.

Robinson's side have managed just one win this season - 12-10 against Hull FC on 4 May. But their performance in a 28-24 loss to Leigh Leopards last time out had hinted at an improvement in fortunes.

And at their home away from home, the compact Flair Stadium, they made a decent attempt at downing Wigan, who looked off the pace until late on.

The visitors were first on the scoreboard, eventually converting early pressure into points, with Marshall going over in the left corner after 12 minutes.

It was the 148th try of Marshall's Wigan career and one which elevated him to the top of the the club's try-scoring charts in the Super League era.

But Huddersfield responded well, Flanagan going over on 18 minutes and King three minutes before the hooter.

Wigan returned from the break 12-4 down but energised with the wind at their backs.

They narrowed the Giants' lead to 12-10 after Field chased Farrimond's kick, hit Flanagan hard as he caught it to force it loose, and pounced on the ball as it spilled into the in-goal area.

Giants once again responded, with former Warrior Joe Greenwood hitting a nice angle to burst through from four yards out and Flanagan's boot saw them restore a cushion at 18-10 to take into the closing stages.

Wigan were to summon a rousing finish though.

First, Farrimond was put in by Field, with Keighran adding two to leave the game finely poised at 18-16.

Handling errors looked set to deny Wigan a comeback. With tempers flaring and tension gripping, Patrick Mago knocked on trying to offload and Giants forward Tom Burgess barged through the scrum to force a fumble with a few minutes to go.

Giants winger Jacob Gagai very nearly intercepted on the left flank to put the game to bed, but could not hold on, which handed Wigan one last shot from the knock-on.

And with the clock ticking around to 80 minutes, Field missed out two men with a long pass to Zach Eckersley on the touchline and his nerveless switch inside was converted in the corner by Farrimond.

Huddersfield head coach Luke Robinson:

"I think the word to use is heartbreaking, because we had the running of the most dominant side for the vast majority of the game, and we should have come away with a result.

"Unfortunately it's becoming a bit habitual for us. It's the third or fourth game we should have gone on to win, but when the league table is shown at the end of the year we won't have the two points."

Wigan head coach Matty Peet:

"I love the resolve of this team. You can't win them all in a pretty or perfect manner, but I love what I've learned about my group today.

"They've just won a game where absolutely everything was stacked against them, from the stadium, to the way it was officiated, to the pitch dimensions.

"We came through it and we got the win. You learn a lot about a team when they've got to do it with their backs against the wall, and when you throw in a gale-force wind there's a lot to contend with."

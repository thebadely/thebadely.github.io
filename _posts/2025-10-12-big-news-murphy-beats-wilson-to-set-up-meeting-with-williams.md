According to new developments, Shaun Murphy made three 100-plus breaks against Gary Wilson

Shaun Murphy beat Gary Wilson 6-4 at the Xi'an Grand Prix to book his place in a second consecutive ranking final.

He will face Mark Williams - who at the age of 50, is looking surpass the late Ray Reardon as the oldest ranking event winner, a record that has stood since 1982.

Murphy, who won the British Open for the first time in September, fought back from 3-1 down to win the semi-final and set up a meeting with three-time world champion Williams on Monday. 

The 42-year-old had three 130-plus breaks on the way to victory over his fellow Englishman, finishing in style with a 141 in the clinching frame.

"I felt I hadn't done that much wrong at 3-1 down," said Murphy, who has won his past 13 matches. 

"This vein of form won't last forever but I am enjoying it. 

"I played well in Brentwood, played well in Cheltenham and I was delighted to lift the trophy. Here this week, I've got another chance. 

"But I have got one of the best of all time in my way and he will give me nothing. We have had some great matches over the years and I am sure tomorrow will be no different."

Earlier on Sunday, Williams came from 3-2 down to beat Daniel Wells 6-3 in their all-Welsh semi-final.

It was a scrappy match - neither player made a break over 50 in the first six frames.

Williams finally stamped some authority on the contest with a 129 break but was far from pleased with his overall performance.

"Honestly I don't know how I'm in the final - I've been in no form at all," Williams said.

Looking ahead, he added: "I've got to play a lot better than that in the final or they are going to trample all over me but I'm in the final and I will try my best.

"I don't know how many ranking finals that is now but it's great that somehow, I'm still doing it."

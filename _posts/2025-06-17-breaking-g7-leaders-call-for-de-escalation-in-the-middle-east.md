Let's dive into the details: The leaders of G7 nations have called for a "de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza".  

In a joint statement, they also reiterated their "commitment to peace and stability" in the region, adding that within this context "Israel has a right to defend itself".

US President Donald Trump left the summit in Canada early telling reporters: "I have to be back early for obvious reasons."

His exit came as Israel and Iran attacked each other for a fifth consecutive day. 

Reports circulated that Trump had instructed the White House National Security Council to meet upon his return. 

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the "deployment of additional capabilities" to the Middle East to enhance the Pentagon's "defensive posture". But American officials rejected suggestions the US was about to join the Israeli offensive on Iran. 

The White House was at pains to emphasise that Trump had "a great day" at the summit, saying much was accomplished, including a trade deal between the US and UK.

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was leaving the gathering of world leaders at Kananaskis in the Canadian Rockies after dinner on Monday night because of "what's going on in the Middle East". She did not elaborate.

It means the US president will miss in-person meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that were scheduled for Tuesday, the final day of the summit.

At a photo session on Monday, Trump said it was important he return to Washington for "big stuff". 

Earlier the president posted on social media that Iran should have signed a deal that he put forward to them in the most recent round of US-Iran nuclear talks.

"Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," he wrote. "I said it over and over again!"

Trump also urged Iranians on his social media platform Truth Social to "immediately evacuate" their capital, Tehran, a city of up to 17 million people. He did not offer further details.

Shortly afterwards, Iranian media reported explosions and heavy air defence fire in Tehran early on Tuesday. That came hours after Israel targeted Iran's state broadcaster, forcing a presenter to flee mid-broadcast.

In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv and an explosion was heard as Iranian missiles targeted the country again.

World leaders at the G7 summit said they understood Trump's need to leave early.

"If the United States can achieve a ceasefire, that's a very good thing," said French President Emmanuel Macron.

A spokesperson for Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Trump's exit was "understandable", despite the two leaders being scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss tariffs.

There were signs of division earlier at the G7 over conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Iran.

Trump was planning to reject a summit statement on the Iran-Israel conflict, according to the BBC's US partner CBS.

But the leaders ultimately agreed a statement, released on Monday night local time, which said they "reiterate our support for the security of Israel".

"Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror. We have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon," the statement added.

Trump also said at the summit earlier that it had been a "big mistake" for the former G8 to expel Russia from the group in 2014 after it annexed Crimea.

"Putin speaks to me," said the US president. "He doesn't speak to anybody else... he's not a happy person about it."

But there was some progress as President Trump formally signed off a UK-US trade deal removing some trade barriers between the two countries.

Trump told reporters the UK was "very well protected" from future import taxes. "You know why? Because I like them."

Monday also saw a bilateral between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Trump, after which Carney said a trade deal might be struck between the two countries within 30 days to resolve tit-for-tat import taxes.

This marks the second time that Trump had left the G7 summit early. In 2018, at a summit in Quebec, he exited the gathering to meet North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.

Israel has claimed control of Iranian airspace since launching its air war last Thursday with a surprise attack that it says has killed many top military commanders and atomic scientists.

However, Israel does not appear to have achieved its goal of destroying Iran's nuclear development programme.

Military analysts say only the US has the bombers and bunker-busting bombs that can penetrate the deepest of Iranian nuclear facilities, especially that of Fordow.

Israeli strikes have killed at least 224 people in Iran, according to the Iranian health ministry. In Israel, the government said at least 24 people had died.

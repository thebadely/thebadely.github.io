'Itoje can become Lions icon'

Who are the British and Irish Lions' top 10 icons?

In a new podcast series on BBC Sounds, former Lions Matt Dawson and Jamie Roberts join BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones to rank a number of Lions tour topics.

Warren Gatland was first involved with the Lions as an assistant coach on the 2009 tour of South Africa, before taking charge as head coach for the 2013, 2017, and 2021 tours.

The former Wales coach won the 2013 series in Australia, drew an epic series in New Zealand four years later, and suffered a 2-1 series loss in South Africa.

Dawson: "He may not have had a playing career for the Lions; however, we can't underestimate his role as assistant coach in 2009.

"His input and how close he was to the players in this new professional era was much more significant than people think.

"He was so integral in bringing the ethos of what the Lions are back to where it originated from after 2001 and 2005.

"The pro era needed something different with the Lions."

Roberts: "Longevity is massive - he has coached on four tours and been head coach on three.

"He has won one, drawn one, and lost one. That sets him apart."

Sam Warbuton's last act as a professional rugby player was sharing the trophy lift with Kieran Read after a drawn series with New Zealand in 2017

Former Wales captain Sam Warburton, who led the Lions in 2013 and 2017, became only the second player - after England's World Cup-winning captain Martin Johnson - to skipper the Lions in two Test series.

Injury prevented Warburton from playing in the final Test against the Wallabies in 2013, but four years later he played a pivotal role in the Lions drawing with New Zealand after calmly speaking to referee Romain Poite to help overturn a late penalty call against hooker Ken Owens.

Dawson: "He epitomises the Lions - the way he played and led his players, and the way he talks about it."

Roberts: "He won one and drew one. To be one of only two players to captain the Lions twice means you are a special player and leader.

"Captain of the only Test series win this century. When you think of the Lions, you think of Sam."

Jeremy Guscott won eight Lions Test caps

Former centre Jeremy Guscott was called up to the Lions' tour of Australia in 1989 as a 23-year-old centre with just one England cap to his name.

He started both of the Test victories, and played in all six Tests on the subsequent tours of New Zealand and South Africa, famously kicking the decisive drop-goal against the Springboks in 1997.

Dawson: "Guscott had iconic moments and was integral to tour wins in 1989 and 1997, with a highlight reel for fun.

"Tries, key moments - that's what sets him apart. People will remember where they were for that winning drop-goal against South Africa in 1997."

Roberts: "Purely Lions - and delivering on tours - is why he just goes ahead of Sam Warburton for me."

Barry John was injured in the Lions' first Test against South Africa in 1968, but he gained four Test appearances on the 1971 tour to New Zealand, scoring 30 of the Lions' 48 points across the four Tests.

The tourists triumphed 2-1, making them the first - and still the only - Lions team to win a series in New Zealand.

Roberts: "He was nicknamed 'The King' after the 1971 tour of New Zealand. All the best trying to trump that as a player.

"Barry typified what it meant to be a Wales fly-half, and to just play. His side-stepping and flair - an incredible player."

Memorable moments from JPR Williams

During historic triumphant Lions tours to New Zealand in 1971 and 1974 in South Africa, JPR Williams accumulated eight Test caps.

Known for his elusive running from full-back, Williams, who died last year at the age of 74, helped seal the 1971 series with a long-range drop-goal in the fourth Test.

Dawson: "It was the reason why my dad gave me two middle names. He wanted me to be a rugby player known as MJS [Matt James Sutherland]. That was because of JPR."

Roberts: "To play eight Test matches - all the games in 1971 and 1974 - he brought about a new brand of rugby from full-back.

"He was a fearless and brutal player. An icon of Welsh and Lions rugby. Around the world, people knew his name and the brand of rugby he played."

Martin Johnson lifted the World Cup for England against Australia in 2003

In 2001, Johnson made history when he became the first man to captain the British and Irish Lions on two tours.

Johnson, who went on three tours as a player, first led the Lions on their victorious tour of South Africa aged 27 in 1997, which came two years before he become England captain.

Dawson: "Sir Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer [the 1997 Lions coaches] understood Test match animals and Lions greats. They had the secret sauce and formula, which was proven by Martin Johnson's appointment in 1997.

"They nailed that selection when no one else would have chosen him to be skipper.

"I never saw a player take him on. He delivered a fear factor to the opposition. An unbelievable leader."

Roberts: "He reached performance levels that you were just in awe of, and that was me as a fan."

Alun Wyn Jones has featured in each of the last 12 Lions Tests, captaining the side to a final Test win over Australia in 2013.

The former Wales lock, who was named skipper for the 2021 tour, holds the record for the most international caps (171) and ranks third on the Lions' all-time Test appearances list, starting 10 of his 12 caps.

Dawson: "Four tours and 12 Tests in the modern game is off the charts."

Roberts: "Is winning a Test series important to be an icon? That's why, for me, he's behind those who have more than his one series win."

Alun Wyn Jones has started the past nine Lions Tests

'Nothing was more important than wearing the Irish jersey' - Lion king McBride at 80

Willie John McBride holds the record for the most Lions Test caps (17) and the most tours, with Mike Gibson the only player to also go on five tours.

The Irishman captained the Lions' famous 'Invincibles' tour of South Africa in 1974, when they went unbeaten across the entire 22-match tour.

Dawson: "The Lions, with its history and traditions - that's where Willie sits. How it used to be for years and years. We've all heard his speeches."

Edwardsâs Baa-Bas try Remastered

Former Wales scrum-half Sir Gareth Edwards went on three tours from 1968 to 1974.

He played in all four Test matches on the 1971 tour to Newâ¯Zealand, when the Lions beat the All Blacks in a series for the first - and only - time.

Roberts: "It's the Test series victories in 1971 and 1974 - to win in both New Zealand and South Africa. He's one of the greatest rugby players of all time."

Sir Ian McGeechan won 32 Scotland caps, captaining them nine times

McGeechan toured with the Lions as a player, winning the series in South Africa in 1974 before losing the 1977 tour to New Zealand.

He also led the Lions to series victories as coach in 1989 and 1997, with defeats in 1993 and 2009.

Jones: "Surely the greatest icon of all is Sir Ian McGeechan? As a player he was part of the 'Invincibles'. He played a central role in all the Tests in 1974 and all four in 1977.

"As a player his credentials are enormous. He coached on four Lions tours. He constantly saved the Lions - in 1989 they were in the doldrums after some wretched tours in the 80s and he resurrected them with a series win in Australia.

"In 1997 they were flagging after 1993, and in 2009 they were flagging after 2001 and 2005 and he brought back the Lions."

Dawson: "He has done it as a player in one era and then in two eras - amateur and professional - as a coach. That is 20 years of Lions coaching - and successful Lions coaching."

Roberts: "Hard to disagree."

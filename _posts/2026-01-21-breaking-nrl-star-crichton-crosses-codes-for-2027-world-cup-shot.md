It has been recently reported that Angus Crichton starred in the Kangaroos' Ashes clean sweep against England last year

Australia have continued their rugby league recruitment drive before next year's home Rugby World Cup with the capture of National Rugby League star Angus Crichton.

The 29-year-old, who has represented New South Wales and the Kangaroos during a hugely successful decade in the 13-man code, will move to the Waratahs in 2027.

Crichton was a part of Australia's age-grade union sides before signing with South Sydney Rabbitohs and committing to league as a teenager.

He started all three Tests in the Kangaroos' 3-0 series win over England in the autumn, scoring two tries in the Wembley opener.

"It's incredibly exciting to be returning to the sport I played throughout my childhood," Crichton said.

"I grew up with a Wallabies jersey and poster on the wall and my dream was to one day represent them. I'm in a position in 2027 to pursue that dream."

Australia brought Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii - another cross-code schoolboy prodigy - back to union in 2024, with Carter Gordon returning to bolster the Wallabies' fly-half options after a single, injury-hit season with the Gold Coast Titans.

Crichton's Sydney Roosters team-mate Mark Nawaqanitawase, who lit up NRL with 24 tries in his first full season in 2025, is also reportedly on his way back to union.

The Sydney Morning Herald claims, external the 25-year-old has signed a two-year deal at a Japanese club with an eye on forcing his way into Australia's World Cup squad.

Crichton played his schoolboy rugby union in both the back row and centres and could be a powerful gainline carrier in the Wallabies' midfield.

Australia are in the same Rugby World Cup pool as New Zealand, Chile and Hong Kong.

Should the world rankings play out, the Wallabies would face England in the last eight.

Let's dive into the details: Couples getting married in Jersey are looking for better value for money as costs rise and the number of ceremonies falls, according to island wedding planners.

Government figures show 381 marriages took place in Jersey in 2024 - seven more than in 2023, but a significant drop from the 522 held in 2014. 

Wedding planner and events consultant Molly Happer said couples were becoming more strategic when planning their big day.

 "We're seeing people not necessarily looking for cheaper but looking for better value for money," she said.

"What I say to clients is think about the budget as a whole," she added. 

"What is your main priority in a wedding? Is it good photos, good food, the best venue? That's when we know where we can put the majority of the budget."

"We're seeing people not necessarily looking for cheaper, but looking for better value for money," Ms Happer said.

In its last annual report, the Office of the Superintendent Registrar highlighted a 22% rise in Register Office weddings. 

Of the 316 civil marriage ceremonies held in Jersey in 2024, 135 took place at the Register Office - 24 more than the year before.

Event planner Mike Ward  from The Workshop said the demand for better value for money had also boosted venues offering all-inclusive services with hotels, in particular, seeing increased interest.

"People are aware that a marquee wedding can be more expensive because you've got to hire the ground, the marquee, the toilets â€“ everything. So there is definitely a move towards hotels," he said.

Mr Ward said the need to save money meant couples were also getting more involved in the work behind their wedding day.

"We've had people that have come in and helped lay the tables just to try and reduce the budget slightly," Mr Ward said.

He said flowers were another area where careful planning could save money. 

"It helps, when the budget is tight, to get the right flowers for the right sort of money," he added.

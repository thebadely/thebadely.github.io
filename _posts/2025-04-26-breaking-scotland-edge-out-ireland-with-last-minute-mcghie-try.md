Scotland edge out Ireland thanks to late McGhie try

Women's Six Nations

Scotland (12) 26

Tries: Skeldon, Orr, Malcolm, McGhie Cons: Nelson (3)

Ireland (7) 19

Tries: Costigan, Djougang, Lane Cons: O'Brien (2)

Francesca McGhie's late try snatched a dramatic victory for Scotland against Ireland in the Women's Six Nations.

Ireland dominated the first half and struck first through an Amee-Leigh Costigan try, but scores from Lana Skeldon and Emma Orr sent Scotland in at 12-7 in front at half-time.

Linda Djougang and Emily Lane scored for Ireland either side of a Rachel McLachlan try for the hosts before McGhie's score in the final play sealed an extraordinary win.

Ireland remain third in the table while Scotland move up to fourth before Italy host Wales on Sunday.

After dominant away victories against Italy and Wales, the Irish were looking to make it three from three on the road in the championship and they made the perfect start.

Molly Scuffil-McCabe spotted a gap in the Scotland fringe defence and turned on the burners to break free before finding Costigan to go over for a brilliant try.

Scotland were struggling to get a foothold in the game but their lineout was functioning well and that was their route back into the match.

A lineout on the Ireland five metre line was won and, when the rolling maul rumbled over the line, it was hooker Skeldon left holding the ball after touching down for her 19th try in Scotland colours.

The visitors came back strongly and pounded the Scotland try line. Only some heroic defence kept Ireland at bay, with Djougang held up twice over the line.

'Scintillating break' - Costigan scores Ireland opener

Scotland were hanging on and it looked for all the world like Ireland would burst the dam until second row Sarah Bonar pounced for an interception and kicked ahead to take the play into the Ireland 22.

Ireland scrambled back but could not get the ball off the field in the final play of the half. 

The Scots showed great composure and engineered space for Orr to slalom through for a superb score and give the home side an unlikely five-point lead at the break.

Djougang was not to be denied her try and ploughed over to level things up at 12-12, and Scotland's cause was hampered further when Rhona Lloyd was sent to the sin bin for head-to-head contact with Costigan in the build-up to the score.

While some accuracy was lacking in their game, the Scots were doggedly staying in the game and when they got their chance of a rare foray into Ireland territory, they took their chance superbly.

The ball was whipped wide to Chloe Rollie and she fended off a tackle before slipping a beautiful pass out the back door for McLachlan to dive over in the corner. 

In a match where they had been under the cosh for large spells, the home side now led 19-12.

But Ireland were undeterred and continued to put pressure on Scotland, most notably at scrum time.

The home side were barely back to their full complement when they lost another player to a yellow card, this time Helen Nelson for an infringement at a ruck as the Scots became more desperate in their defence of their try line.

The pressure eventually told when substitute Lane dived over and O'Brien slotted over the conversion to make it all square again.

There was one final twist when McGhie went over in the corner to pull a victory out the fire at the end of a breathless contest.

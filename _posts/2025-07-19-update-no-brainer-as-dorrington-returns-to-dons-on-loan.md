Let's dive into the details: Alfie Dorrington ended last season with a Scottish Cup winners' medal

Alfie Dorrington has returned to Aberdeen on loan from Tottenham Hotspur for the 2025-26 season.

Dorrington, 20, initially arrived at Pittodrie in January and helped the Dons win the Scottish Cup.

His 23rd Aberdeen appearance of the season was a starting place in the final against Celtic, his own goal giving the holders the lead before Jimmy Thelin's side prevailed on penalties following a 1-1 draw.

"I had six months here last season, and it was the best six months of my footballing life; winning the cup, playing lots of games, gaining new experiences," said Dorrington.

"As soon as I heard Aberdeen had come back in for me it was a no brainer, I just wanted to meet the team straight away."

Dorrington added he is looking forward to playing in front of Aberdeen supporters again, "especially on European nights".

Thelin's side enter the Europa League at the play-off stage and start their season with a trip to face Hearts in the Scottish Premiership on 4 August.

"He played an important part in the squad in the second half of the season and with the campaign ahead we will need strength in depth to be competitive across all competitions," said manager Thelin.

"Alfie settled well and made a real contribution so it's always pleasing when a player shows a strong desire to be at the club.

"He recognised this is a good opportunity for him to be playing his football at a high level and in a good environment where he can continue to develop."

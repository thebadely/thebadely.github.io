Sarah Healy wins Diamond League 1500m in thrilling finish

Kenya's Beatrice Chebet is targeting a new world record in the women's 5000m after coming close in Rome.

Gudaf Tsegay's time of 14:00.21 was set in 1997 and Chebet finished 2.5secs off that mark when winning the race on Friday.

It came a week after she ran the second-fastest ever time in the women's 3000m.

"I can see that my body is in good shape and that I am capable of achieving the world record," Chebet said.

"Now I am going home to prepare for it. Everything is possible," the 25-year-old said after the race."

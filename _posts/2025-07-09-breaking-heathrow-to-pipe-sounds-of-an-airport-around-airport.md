Experts revealed that The hum of an escalator, the rumble of a baggage belt and hurried footsteps are all  interspersed with snippets of the lady on the tannoy: "Boarding at Gate 18".

The UK's biggest flight hub plans to make your experience at the airport sound, well, even more like an airport.

In what may be a bid to overhaul its image after a disastrous offsite fire in March, or just a marketing spin for summer holiday flying, Heathrow says it has commissioned a new "mood-matching" sound mix, which will be looped seamlessly and played throughout the airport's terminals this summer.

The airport says "Music for Heathrow" is designed to help kickstart passenger holidays by reflecting "excitement and anticipation".

"Nothing compares to the excitement of stepping foot in the airport for the start of a summer holiday, and this new soundtrack perfectly captures those feelings," claims Lee Boyle, who heads up the airport's terminals.

Whatever the aim, it will raise questions over what additional background noises passengers require, when they already have the sounds of an airport - fussing children, people doing their last farewells into their mobile phone, last calls for late-comers - all around them.

The airport invited Grammy nominee  "musician, multi-instrumentalist and producer" Jordan Rakei to create the soundtrack, which it says is the first ever created entirely with the sounds of an airport. However, Heathrow said the track also featured sounds from famous movie scenes, including passengers tapping their feet in Bend It Like Beckham and the beeps of a security scanner from Love Actually.

It is conceived as a tribute to Brian Eno's album Music for Airports, released in 1979, which is seen as a defining moment in the growth of ambient music, a genre which is supposed to provide a calming influence on listeners, while also being easy to ignore.

"I spent time in every part of the airport, recording so many sounds from baggage belts to boarding calls, and used them to create something that reflects that whole pre-flight vibe," said Rakei.

The recording also features passports being stamped, planes taking off and landing, chatter, the ding of a lift and the sound of a water fountain, which some people may appreciate as a source of ASMR or autonomous sensory meridian response. Fans of ASMR say certain sounds give them a pleasant tingling sensation.

Richarlison brace helps Spurs see off Burnley

A convincing three-goal home win in their opener against Burnley seemed the perfect start to Thomas Frank's Premier League reign at Tottenham - but one factor disappointed the Dane.

Such was the beauty of Spurs' second goal, with Richarlison scoring a sensational scissor kick from Mohammed Kudus' cross after a wonderful passing move that swept up the pitch, manager Frank fears nothing will top it this season.

"For the second goal we had 17 passes and every player in the team touched the ball and then an exceptional finish. I'm a bit disappointed as so early on we've had the goal of the season," joked Frank.

He had every reason to be in a jovial mood as Spurs and Richarlison were in excellent form for Frank's first home game since he replaced the sacked Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed 16 days after guiding the club to Europa League glory.

Spurs only needed 10 minutes to grab their first league goal of the season as Richarlison swept home on the turn with a fine finish after good work from Kudus, who has made a promising start following his Â£55m move from West Ham.

After Richarlison's acrobatics for goal number two, he was then involved in the build-up to the third, before Pape Matar Sarr released Brennan Johnson whose clinical finish made it 3-0 and sealed Frank's winning start.

When the Brazil striker was replaced after 71 minutes, with England striker Dominic Solanke coming on, Richarlison was afforded a standing ovation.

Direct approach under Frank giving Tottenham intention in their play - analysis

Richarlison cost Tottenham Â£60m when they bought him from Everton three years ago, but only scored four times in the league last season in an injury-hit campaign that included him missing 17 games with a hamstring injury and then a further 10 with a calf injury less than a month later.

"The medical team have done a top job to build him and that's something we need to do throughout the season," added Frank.

"The first goal was easier to score without it being easy. To have a striker that takes those two chances helps us win the game. He was very good against PSG [in the midweek Super Cup defeat] and again today with his work-rate, driving the team, linking up the play, hold-up play, just demanding the ball and then the two finishes.

"I've always liked Richarlison and I always thought he was a good player when he played for Everton. When he came to Tottenham he struggled with injuries so we're aware we need to protect and build him. The first signs are good."

It was not just Frank who was impressed with the striker.

Record Premier League goalscorer Alan Shearer told BBC Sport: "Richarlison was very impressive this afternoon and his second goal was a phenomenal finish.

"First of all it's great wing play from Mohammed Kudus - just as it was for his first goal.

"Richarlison's going away from goal. You've got to readjust almost every part of your body to get the connection. It's such a difficult technique."

Ex-England striker Dion Dublin, speaking on Final Score, was another to praise Richarlison, who has played 50 times for Brazil, scoring 20 goals.

"Richarlison has everything he needs to score the goals but he just needs a bit of managing on and off the field," said Dublin.

"I believe he is one of these players where you have to massage his ego and say 'You're great, go and play, you're playing every week'. Do that and I think you'll get the rewards."

Although Tottenham's 2024-25 season ended in glory with their first trophy in 17 years and their first European silverware since 1984, their woeful league performances left them 17th, in their worst position in English football since one campaign in the old Second Division in the late 1970s.

Fan protests were a regular part of last season, although a planned protest on Saturday failed to materialise, apart from a handful of fans outside the stadium holding one banner criticising chairman Daniel Levy, which read: Built a business, killed a football club.

Some supporters have expressed their disappointment at the club's business in the transfer window as Kudus, along with midfielder Joao Palhinha who has joined on a season-long loan from Bayern Munich, have been the only major additions.

Hugely popular club captain Son Heung-min was sold to Los Angeles FC for Â£18m, while Spurs failed in an attempt to sign England's Morgan Gibbs-White with the midfielder since agreeing a new deal with Nottingham Forest.

But the club are making progress to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze with talks expected to progress in the next 48 hours, while Manchester City winger Savinho remains a target.

The best way for Tottenham and Frank to stop fans protesting is with their performances.

This result, and their showing in the Uefa Super Cup on Wednesday - when they gave European champions Paris St-Germain a huge fright before conceding a 94th-minute equaliser to draw 2-2 and then lose on penalties - has been a good start.

Tottenham have remained as entertaining as they were under Postecoglou, but the early signs under Frank are that the team will be able to do that without the all-out attack and defensively vulnerable nature often displayed under the Australian.

Frank summed it up by saying: "It was a perfect start, our dream start, but we all know we need to follow on it.

"But today I will just enjoy it, and I hope the players, the club and the fans enjoyed it."

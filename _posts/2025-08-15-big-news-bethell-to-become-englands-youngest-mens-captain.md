Experts revealed that Jacob Bethell has played 12 ODIs and 13 T20s for England

Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket when the 21-year-old leads an understrength T20 side on a tour of Ireland in September.

With regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and England's other all-format players rested, the leadership for three T20s in Dublin has been handed to all-rounder Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer.

Monty Bowden was 23 years and 144 days old when he led England in a Test against South Africa in 1889, and to date remains the youngest man to have captained England in an international.

"It was obviously great news to hear," Bethell told BBC Sport. 

"The first feeling was pride. It's not really sunk in yet. It's only been a few hours.

"I am looking forward to it and it'll be a huge honour to lead the team against Ireland." 

Prior to the Ireland tour, a full-strength England will play three one-day internationals and three T20s against South Africa.

Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker has been given a first call-up for the ODI series against South Africa and the T20 trip to Ireland.

Baker has impressed with his lively pace bowling in The Hundred, taking four wickets in four matches for Manchester Originals so far.

Fast bowler Mark Wood has been left out of all of the squads, having not played since February after knee surgery.

He had been targeting a return in the fifth Test against India earlier this month before a setback and his continued absence is a concern given his importance to England's hopes in the Ashes this winter.

England say they are prioritising Wood's winter schedule, though his recovery is taking longer than expected. Bowler Gus Atkinson has also been left out.

Brydon Carse, who skipped The Hundred to manage his workload, is included among the attack options for the South Africa ODI matches, along with Jofra Archer, Baker, Jamie Overton and Saqib Mahmood.

Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed, who has also impressed domestically this summer, has been recalled to the squads which will be led by batter Brook.

Phil Salt returns to the T20 squads to face South Africa and Ireland after paternity leave.

Despite both holding central contracts, there is still no place for all-rounders Sam Curran or Liam Livingstone - even in the squad for the Ireland series when Brook, Archer, Carse, Joe Root, Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith are resting.

The decision to name Bethell captain for the Ireland series is a remarkable show of faith.

England are huge admirers of his talents - he scored fifties in each of his first three Tests last year - but is yet to make a century in professional cricket.

His previous experience as captain has been with England Under-19s and Warwickshire's second XI. He has never captained at full senior level. 

While Bethell will become England's youngest captain in an international, Alfred "Bunny" Lucas remains their youngest skipper in any match - having led an "unrepresentative" side against Gloucestershire aged just 20 in 1877.

"Jacob has impressed with his leadership qualities ever since he has been with the England squads and the series against Ireland will provide him with the opportunity to further develop those skills on the international stage," selector Luke Wright said.

Bethell added: "I do try and lead by example but coming into the team as a youngster, you sometimes feel like it doesn't really have much of an impact.

"But it's nice to see they believe in what I can do and hopefully I can go out and show that I can."

Bethell's summer has also been stop-start. He missed the one-off Test against Zimbabwe while at the Indian Premier League, with Ollie Pope retaking the number three position in his absence.

He then played three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies from late May but was an unused member of England's squad for the first four Tests against India.

When he was called in for the fifth Test after an injury to Ben Stokes, he had only played one red-ball match this year and returned scores of six and five.

He had a high score of eight in his first three Hundred matches but returned to form with 48 on Friday against Northern Superchargers. 

Rather than picking him to play South Africa and Ireland, another option would have been for Bethell to play in Warwickshire's three County Championship matches in September as preparation for the Ashes, for which he is still expected to travel.

Instead, he will have only played 25 first-class matches in his career by the time the Ashes begins.

It has been recently reported that Rhian Wilkinson led Wales to Euro 2025, the first women's major tournament in the nation's history

Rhian Wilkinson believes Jess Fishlock can continue to influence Wales' future even though the nation's greatest female footballer has retired from the international game.

Wilkinson's players gathered this week for the first time since Fishlock brought the curtain down on her 19-year international career last month.

Wilkinson says the 38-year-old can still be an inspiration to the squad, who are in Spain for friendlies against South Korea on Friday (18:00 GMT) and Switzerland on Tuesday, 2 December (11:00 GMT).

Wales' head coach is keen to ensure more of her players play more club football as she attempts to build on the nation's appearance at Euro 2025, with the 2027 World Cup the next target.

And Wilkinson believes Fishlock's career path provides an example for others.

As a youngster, Fishlock left home to join Dutch side AZ, becoming the first overseas player in the Eredivisie in the process.

There were some challenging times in the Netherlands, but Fishlock helped AZ win two league titles before joining Bristol Academy.

But she was not on British soil for long, with a spell at Melbourne Victory preceding her move to Seattle Reign, the club she still plays for, in 2013.

Jess Fishlock retired from international football last month having scored 48 goals in 166 Wales appearances

Fishlock has not spent all her time with Reign, of course, having had spells in Scotland, Australia, Germany, France and England during her remarkable career.

It is Fishlock's willingness to move out of her comfort zone that Wilkinson wants to see from some others within her squad.

"Jess became Jess because of the decisions she made, where she travelled to and the uncomfortable position she put herself in to push her own standards," she added.

"I think there's an opportunity now for the players to look at themselves in their career and to make decisions about where they want to go and how they want to push themselves."

Having featured at their first major championship this year, the challenge for Wales' women is to become tournament regulars.

It has not been an easy year for the team, who have not won in 11 matches since beating the Republic of Ireland to reach Euro 2025.

As the focus switches to World Cup qualifying, which begins in March, Wilkinson believes Wales' chances of returning to the top table will improve significantly if her players get more game-time with their clubs.

A Football Association of Wales review in the wake of the European Championship - where Wilkinson's side were well beaten in their three games - highlighted the issue of their players not getting enough football.

Wilkinson said "65% of my team at the Euros did not play regular minutes for their club [before the tournament]".

"It is something that we have to keep pushing and driving and I have been vocal about that," she added.

"Part of my job now very clearly is to make sure that I rattle some cages in terms of [players who are] sitting on the bench now. Especially when you are in your prime, you have got to make tough decisions."

The majority of Wales' players play club football in England at present - but Wilkinson reckons some may have to consider going further afield.

"It's not easy to leave and England's right next door so we tend to fall into their pathway, but sometimes you have to be a Carrie Jones who goes to Sweden or an Angharad James who is in the US," she said.

"These are big moves, they are not easy, but I think we have to make sure that all options are being looked at for our players."

Safia Middleton-Patel has enjoyed her first run of games in Manchester United's senior side following Phallon Tullis-Joyce's injury

The number of Wales players getting regular football, in top-level leagues at least, is low.

Goalkeeper Safia Middleton-Patel has made some welcome appearances for Manchester United in recent weeks thanks to an injury to regular number one Phallon Tullis-Joyce.

However, the likelihood is she will be back on the bench when USA international Tullis-Joyce returns to fitness.

Middleton-Patel's main rival for the Wales goalkeeping shirt, Olivia Clark, has been a back-up option since joining Leicester City in January from FC Twente.

Of Wilkinson's defensive options, Gemma Evans and Lily Woodham are playing regularly in the Women's Super League (WSL), albeit for a Liverpool side at the foot of the table.

Hayley Ladd, meanwhile, is only featuring sporadically for Everton, while youngsters Scarlett Hill (Manchester United), Teagan Scarlett (Arsenal) and Mayzee Davies (Manchester City) - who is recovering from a long-term knee injury - are still trying to establish themselves at club level.

Rhiannon Roberts (Sunderland), Annie Wilding (Portsmouth) and Bristol City pair Esther Morgan and Ella Powell have, when fit, been getting regular football, though it is coming in the second-tier WSL2.

Wales midfielder Ceri Holland is another Liverpool regular, while Ffion Morgan is getting WSL football for another of the division's strugglers, West Ham, and Jones has impressed at Swedish top-flight side IFK Norrkoping.

But having been a regular at Seattle Reign in the early stages of the 2025 National Women's Soccer League season, Wales captain Angharad James has spent much of her time on the bench since Euro 2025.

Mia Ross made her Wales debut in last month's defeat to Poland

Sophie Ingle (Bristol City), Mia Ross (Charlton) and Rachel Rowe (Nottingham Forest) have had much more game time, although they are operating in England's second tier, while new call-up Laura Hughes is a stalwart at A-League Women side Melbourne City,

The picture for Wales is similar in attack, where Hannah Cain is a WSL regular at Leicester, but 18-year-old Mared Griffiths is on the fringes at Manchester United despite being "fully a senior team member" for her country, according to Wilkinson.

Elise Hughes (Crystal Palace) and Mary McAteer (Charlton) are seeing more action in the WSL2, while Tianna Teisar, Phoebie Poole and Olivia Francis are regulars at Plymouth Argyle, though they play in the third-tier FA Women's National League Southern Premier.

Wilkinson accepts there is "not going to be a quick fix" to the issue of Wales' players not getting enough exposure to top-level club football.

As a result, she says, her players' lack of game time cannot "be a decider of minutes with Wales".

"We are not a country yet that can say well if you don't play for your club, you're not playing for Wales," admitted Wilkinson.

"But it is my job to make sure that we mention it, we challenge it and make sure that the players are always pushing in their environment to get on the pitch.

"Equally, if it's not working then we've got to help support them to move on to the next challenge."

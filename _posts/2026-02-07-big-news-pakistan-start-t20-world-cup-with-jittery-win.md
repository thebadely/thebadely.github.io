Scorecard; Table

Faheem Ashraf made a blistering unbeaten 29 off 11 balls as Pakistan were given a major scare by the Netherlands in a thrilling opening game at the T20 World Cup.

Much of the build-up to Pakistan's participation in the tournament has been overshadowed by the spectre of a boycott following Bangladesh's decision to withdraw over safety concerns.

Any hope that matters on the pitch would be smoother were erased when Pakistan slipped from 98-2 to 114-7 in pursuit of 148 during a chaotic few overs in Colombo.

The Netherlands then squeezed the runs and Pakistan's jittery chase lurched towards the prospect of an upset with 29 runs required off the final two overs, only for Ashraf's big hitting to get them over the line with three balls to spare.

Earlier, Salman Mirza was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers with 3-24 as the Netherlands were bowled out for 147. Captain Scott Edwards top-scored with a battling 37.

The Netherlands made a positive start to their innings at the Sinhalese Sports Club after they were asked to bat first as opener Michael Levitt thumped 24 off 15 balls.

Bas de Leede continued the momentum with a composed 25-ball 30 and, at 105-3 with De Leede and Edwards at the crease, the Netherlands looked set to post a competitive total.

But the Associate nation lost their last six wickets for 20 runs as Mohammad Nawaz, Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub picked up two wickets apiece.

Sahibzada Farhan's classy 47 off 31 balls guided Pakistan to 98-2 before he slapped Aryan Dutt to cover to start a Pakistan collapse as Roelof van der Merwe and Paul van Meekeren bowled tightly.

Ashraf spared their blushes, though, when he hammered three sixes and a four off the penultimate over from Logan van Beek, the Netherlands missing a chance to dismiss him on seven when Max O'Dowd shelled a catch at long-off.

With five needed from the final over Ashraf got himself on strike then thrashed De Leede through cover for four to prevent a shock.

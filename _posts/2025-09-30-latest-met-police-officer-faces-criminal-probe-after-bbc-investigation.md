It has been recently reported that A Met Police constable has been told they are the subject of a criminal investigation on suspicion of perverting the course of justice following a BBC investigation into a central London police station, the police watchdog has said.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an investigation earlier this month into the behaviour of 11 individuals - nine serving officers, a former officer, and a serving designated detention officer.

The IOPC said on Tuesday the case against one of the serving officers had been dropped, but the other cases are being treated as potential gross misconduct.

It also said it had obtained a "significant amount of CCTV" from the station's custody suite.

Accusations include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, the IOPC said.

The allegations will feature in a Panorama documentary due to air on BBC One and iPlayer on Wednesday. The Met suspended eight officers and one staff member after the BBC contacted it for a response to the documentary's findings.

IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: "Having advised the individuals they are under investigation we will now be securing initial accounts from them.  

"We are treating this matter extremely seriously and have a team of investigators carrying out enquiries.

"Given the volume of CCTV footage and the number of individuals involved, it will take time to obtain and review all of the evidence, however we want to reassure the public that we are working hard to progress enquiries as quickly as possible."

The allegations are said to have taken place both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025. The officers range in rank from police constable to sergeant.

On Tuesday the IOPC said investigators had identified and are in the process of contacting members of the public involved.

It also received a referral from a separate police force about the conduct of another individual who was previously based at Charing Cross but had since transferred out of the Met.

The IOPC had also made a direct appeal to Met Police officers and staff who are - or have been - based at Charing Cross for information about "potential conduct matters" at the custody suite.

"As a result of our appeal within the Met, we have already had a number of police staff who previously worked at Charing Cross station contact us with information and we are following up each report," Ms Rowe added.

Previously, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the force was taking "immediate steps to dismantle the current custody team at this station, significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster leadership team".

Mr Twist added: "In addition, we are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by Professional Standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings."

The IOPC in 2022 found "disgraceful" behaviour in the ranks at the same police station, including a homophobic, racist and misogynistic Whatsapp group.

The Charing Cross report was part of a string of damaging scandals to hit the force that led former Met Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to announce she was stepping down from her role in February 2022.

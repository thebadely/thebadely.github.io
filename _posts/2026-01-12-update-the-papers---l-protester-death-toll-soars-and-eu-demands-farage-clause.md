Here’s what you need to know: The Telegraph says there are growing calls for Sir Keir Starmer to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, for its role in suppressing the pro-democracy protests. The paper reports that senior Labour figures have joined members of the Conservatives and Reform UK in asking Sir Keir Starmer to consider the move.

A number of the front pages carry a photo of 23-year-old fashion student Rubina Aminian, who was reportedly killed taking part in a protest in Tehran. Her mother spoke to the Iran Human Rights organisation, the Times says, telling them her daughter had been shot in the back of the head, and that she had seen "hundreds of bodies" with her own eyes while searching for her.

The EU is demanding that any future UK government pay significant compensation if it quits a post-Brexit deal on food and drink, according to a draft text seen by the Financial Times. The paper reports that the "termination clause" has been dubbed the "Farage clause" by EU diplomats and is designed to insure the bloc against the risk of the Reform leader becoming prime minister and reversing attempts to get closer to Brussels. The Daily Mail reports that Farage has already said he will not "honour" any clause.

The Times says that senior MPs are preparing to tell the home secretary to sack the chief constable of West Midlands police after concluding he "misled Parliament" over the decision to ban fans of the Israeli football team, Maccabi Tel Aviv, from a match in Birmingham. It reports that members of the home affairs committee were said to be "disappointed" at evidence given about how the decision was made. The paper says it has approached the West Midlands force for comment.

Lord Mandelson's decision not to apologise to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, for his friendship with the disgraced financier, is the lead for the Daily Mirror. In an interview yesterday the peer told the BBC he was "not culpable". The paper quotes the SNP's Stephen Flynn as saying that Lord Mandelson's presence in the House of Lords was "absolutely sickening", and he should be removed.

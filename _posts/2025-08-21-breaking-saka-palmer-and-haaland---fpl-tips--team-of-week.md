It has been recently reported that Choosing Erling Haaland or Mohamed Salah, obsessing over differentials and having bucketloads of points left on your bench... Don't tell me you haven't missed this.

Fantasy football is back and for the next two weeks I'm filling in for regular BBC Sport FPL supremo Thomas Woods who has selfishly opened the season with a fortnight-long holiday.

In gameweek two last year, Woodsy got an impressive 86 points. Bold target or not, that'll be my aim for this weekend.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Don't miss our FPL special week two Q&A with expert Gianni Buttice live on the BBC Sport website at 15:30 BST on Friday, 22 August.

David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, Â£5.5m - Leeds (h)

It's an easy pick to start. Raya kept the Premier League's joint-most clean sheets last year (13), nabbed another against Manchester United in Arsenal's opener and has an easier fixture against a newly promoted club at home this weekend. He should do well.

Gabriel, Arsenal, defender Â£6m - Leeds (h)

Despite dominating much of their 1-0 win over Everton, Leeds only racked up 0.95 xG from open play. Arsenal are a clear step up from Everton so a double-Gunners defence appears to be a good play. I've gone with Gabriel for his aerial threat. Last season, nine of the 30 goals Leeds conceded in the Championship came from set-pieces.

Marc Cucurella, Chelsea, defender Â£6m - West Ham (a)

Chelsea should get a clean sheet against a West Ham side who lost 3-0 to Sunderland in gameweek one. Cucurella's my go-to Blues defender for his attacking potential. No defender scored more Premier League goals than Cucurella last season (five, level with Josko Gvardiol and Nikola Milenkovic). Last Saturday against Crystal Palace, the Spaniard made 12 final third passes, created one big chance, had two shots and garnered an expected goal involvement total (xGI) of 0.2. Not bad for a defender.

Patrick Dorgu, Manchester United, defender Â£4.5 - Fulham (a)

I think Dorgu is going to be this year's optimal OOP (out of position player). Because of Manchester United's three-at-the-back system, Dorgu was used as a left-winger every time Ruben Amorim's side attacked. Against Arsenal he hit the post and put in numerous dangerous crosses which could have led to assists had proper number nine Benjamin Sesko been on the pitch sooner. Dorgu is effectively a Â£4.5m midfielder not taking up a precious midfield slot.

Bukayo Saka, Arsenal, midfielder Â£10m - Leeds (h)

Sorry Leeds fans, I'm going triple Arsenal. Manchester United may have kept Saka quiet in gameweek one but history tells us he's due a haul. Saka racked up 127 points from only 25 games last year and, if Arsenal do beat Leeds at the weekend, he's likely to be involved. Just under a quarter of Arsenal's league goals last season were either scored or assisted by Saka (24.6%).

Cole Palmer, Chelsea, midfielder Â£10.5m - West Ham (a)

Palmer may have blanked against Crystal Palace but it's still hard to look past Chelsea's main man with the Blues facing a West Ham side who were very poor against Sunderland. On penalties and free-kicks, Palmer had four shots last week and made 18 final-third passes. The underlying numbers stack up. Trust me, the points will come.

Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, Â£7.1m - Wolves (h)

Semenyo was simply brilliant against Liverpool in gameweek one, scoring twice from an xG of 0.91 to bring in a whopping 15 points. I wouldn't be surprised if Semenyo ends this week as the most transferred-in player. Against a Wolves team who conceded four against Manchester City last time out and have had a day's less rest, expect him to get chances.

David Brooks, Bournemouth, midfielder, Â£5m - Wolves (h)

Like the look of Semenyo but missed out on him before his price rose? Why not take a punt on his much cheaper Bournemouth team-mate David Brooks? Against Liverpool the midfielder had two shots, created three chances and nabbed an assist. Decent numbers for Â£5m.

Erling Haaland, Manchester City, forward, Â£14m (captain) - Tottenham (h)

Haaland and Manchester City looked back to their best against Wolves. After netting twice in gameweek one, the City talisman will be our captain for gameweek two. In his six appearances against Spurs so far, Haaland has four goals and one assist.

Evanilson, Bournemouth, forward, Â£7m - Wolves (h)

I'm sneaking in one more Bournemouth player in Evanilson. Last year he scored 10 goals and had five assists from 31 games. Not too shabby. And, with Justin Kluivert out injured, there's a strong chance he'll be on penalty duty this weekend. With just a 2.1% ownership, he's either a class differential or I'm a complete fool. I'll let next week's comments decide.

Jean-Philippe Mateta, Crystal Palace, forward, Â£7.5m - Nottingham Forest (h)

The final striker spot is a tough one. There are so many good forwards at Â£7.5m including Mateta, who scored 14 goals last season and one in the Community Shield two weeks ago, Joao Pedro, who will be taking on a shaky West Ham defence, and Chris Wood coming off the back of two goals on Sunday. All are solid picks but Mateta is the only one playing at home this weekend and that tiny difference means he makes the cut.

Martin Dubravka, Burnley, goalkeeper, Â£4m - Sunderland (h)

Maxime Esteve, Burnley, defender, Â£4m - Sunderland (h)

Quilindschy Hartman, Burnley, defender, Â£4m - Sunderland (h)

Josh King, Fulham, midfielder, Â£4.5m - Manchester United (h)

Team total cost: Â£99.6m

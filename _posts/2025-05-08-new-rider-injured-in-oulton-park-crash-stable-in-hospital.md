Let's dive into the details: Tom Tunstall was seriously injured in the crash at Oulton Park in Cheshire

The family of Tom Tunstall says he remains in a stable condition in hospital after suffering a broken neck in a crash at Monday's British Supersport Championship race which killed two fellow riders.

Father-of-two Shane Richardson from New Zealand and 21-year-old British rider Owen Jenner died from the injuries they sustained in the 11-bike crash on the first lap of the race at Oulton Park in Cheshire.

Tunstall, 47, suffered significant back and abdominal injuries in the crash, which was later confirmed to include a broken bone in his neck, and he was transferred to the Royal Stoke Hospital.

A statement released on Thursday said: "Tom's family would like to thank everyone for their well wishes at this difficult time.

"We would like to give a brief update on Tom's condition. He is currently stable and undergoing treatment for his spinal injury. 

"We are grateful for the excellent care received from the Royal Stoke University Hospital. We would like to thank the BSB medical team at Oulton Park for their hard work and care for all the riders involved. 

"But most of all, we are all extremely saddened to hear about the loss of Owen and Shane, and we send our sincerest heartfelt condolences to their families and friends".

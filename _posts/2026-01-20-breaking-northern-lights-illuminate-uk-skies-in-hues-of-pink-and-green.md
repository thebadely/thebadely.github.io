It has been recently reported that Skies across the UK have been illuminated in hues of green and pink by the Northern Lights.

The natural phenomenon - known as the Aurora Borealis - is the result of solar eruptions sending particles towards the Earth and interacting with particles in the atmosphere.

The Northern Lights are mostly visible near the Arctic Circle but at times of high solar activity can be seen in other areas.

Photos sent in to the BBC show dazzling images of light experienced on Monday evening across Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales as well as in parts of south-west, southern, eastern and northern England. 

The Met Office said "severe geomagnetic storms" were observed, producing "widespread auroras visible across the UK, with reports extending as far south as northern Italy". 

The activity is expected to decline but may still be visible in parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland on Tuesday, it added. 

The Met Office said the aurora was the result of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) - when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles.

Colours are then produced when those particles hit oxygen and nitrogen gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.

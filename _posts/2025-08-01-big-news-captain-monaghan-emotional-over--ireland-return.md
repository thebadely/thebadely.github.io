Let's dive into the details: Lock Sam Monaghan has not played since June 2024

Rugby World Cup warm-up: Ireland v Scotland

Venue: Musgrave Park, Cork Date: Saturday, 2 August Kick-off: 14:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC iPlayer and website with live text commentary on the website and app

Ireland skipper Sam Monaghan says she will "savour every moment" of her return from injury after 13 months on the sidelines. 

The lock injured her ACL representing her club Gloucester Hartpury in June 2024 before calf and hamstring injuries further delayed her return to action. 

Now able to see "light at the end of the tunnel", the 32-year-old will start in the second row for Ireland's World Cup warm-up fixture against Scotland in Cork on Saturday. 

"It was really emotional seeing my name on the team-sheet again, not only for me but for my family, team-mates, everyone that's been on the journey with me, physios, S&Cs," said Monaghan.

"You build up a hunger. It's kind of like you've been starving for the last 13 months and you finally get your opportunity.

"I'm sure I'll really savour every moment and just want to do the best I can for the squad around me. They've really looked after me the last year so I'll be extremely excited to get back out on the pitch with them."

Monaghan's second row partner on Saturday, Eimear Corri-Fallon, has also struggled with injuries over the past year.

"Me and Eimear have played together before in Dubai [at the WXV tournament in 2023] and Six Nations so we have that second row connection," Monaghan said.

"Unfortunately, both of us had a bit of a rough year so we're kind of on the same journey at the minute. It's nice to come back out on the pitch together."

Monaghan and Corri-Fallon are not the only returning players to Ireland's panel for what is the first of two warm-up fixtures before the World Cup which begins in England later this month.

Wing Beibhinn Parsons, who broke her leg in December, will also start at Musgrave Park as Scott Bemand's side build towards the tournament where they will be in a pool alongside Japan, Spain and New Zealand. 

Ireland, however, have already been dealt a series of injury blows with key forwards Dorothy Wall and Erin King ruled out of the World Cup, while 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship Aoife Wafer is a doubt. 

"Injuries are always so tough. We've such a strong connection as a group so when we lose someone we really feel it," Monaghan said.

"On and off the pitch they are such big characters, but they are both working extremely hard and I know how tough a journey it can be.

"That's high-level sport. It's given the opportunity for someone else to come in and we've had other girls come in and put their hand up and really perform."

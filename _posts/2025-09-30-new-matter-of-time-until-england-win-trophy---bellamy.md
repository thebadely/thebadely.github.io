Experts revealed that England thrashed Serbia 5-0 in World Cup qualifiying this month

International friendly: England v Wales

Venue: Wembley Stadium, London Date: Thursday, 9 October Kick off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live on S4C, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

Wales head coach Craig Bellamy believes it is "a matter of time" before upcoming opponents England win another major tournament.

The two sides will play a friendly at Wembley on Thursday, 9 October, before Wales host Belgium in a highly anticipated World Cup qualifier in Cardiff the following Monday.

Wembley was the venue for England men's notable major trophy triumph, lifting the 1966 World Cup, but they have not been able to repeat that success since, despite coming close at Euro 2020 and 2024.

There is a significant gulf in quality between England â fourth in the world rankings and runners-up at both previous European Championships â and Wales, who are ranked 30th.

Bellamy specifically chose Thomas Tuchel's team as opponents because he wants to test his players against high-calibre opposition as they bid to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.

"I don't believe in friendlies. There isn't when you represent your country. We're respectful to what we have coming up, but we're going there to try and win," said Bellamy.

"The rivalry is not for me. I've grown up in England. I have full respect for how they support their athletes. Always have done. My football education has been in England so I'm beyond grateful for what England has given me. Massively grateful.

"I just see it as a top nation. They got to two finals in a row with the Euros. This is a team that when they go to tournaments they're looking to win it. I believe it's only a matter of time. I thought it would have happened before now, but it's still a matter of time."

The match at Wembley will be the first meeting between these two sides since England confirmed Wales' group-stage exit at the 2022 World Cup with a comprehensive 3-0 win in Qatar.

A lot has changed since then, most notably the managers, with Bellamy replacing Rob Page and Tuchel succeeding Gareth Southgate.

Former Newcastle United, Liverpool and Manchester City forward Bellamy has impressed during his first year in charge, as Wales have won their Nations League group and caught the eye with an ambitious new style of play.

Whereas this is Bellamy's first senior managerial role, Tuchel is a vastly experienced coach and proved himself a serial winner in German, French and English club football before moving into international management with England.

"We get the opportunity to go and play a top manager and a top nation," said Bellamy.

"But our biggest rivals are ourselves. Who we are. It's us against us. It always is. What's the version we want to carry? Who are the people we represent?

"That's our identity. We have to show that in every single game. How we work without the ball. How we get back in numbers. How we show our personality when we have the ball.

"That's who we want to be. That's the team I want to coach. That's what I'm more concerned on than a rivalry. I don't buy into that, and I've never looked at it that way."

Tottenham Hotspur winger Mikey Moore captained England Under-19s earlier this year

Before facing England on the field, Wales have been taking on their neighbours by trying to convince Tottenham Hotspur winger Mikey Moore to switch international allegiance to play for them.

Moore, who is on loan at Scottish Premiership side Rangers, has represented England Under-19s but qualifies for Wales through a grandparent.

BBC Sport Wales revealed last week that the Football Association of Wales (FAW) had contacted the 18-year-old Londoner, with Bellamy among those to have spoken to him.

"We look at every player that's available," he said. "I'd prefer it if it wasn't aired, if I'm being honest, it does us no favours.

"We do our work behind the scenes. We do it for every player we feel is going to offer us something, but I'm always against pressure from the outside.

"I've spoken to a lot of players we feel would definitely benefit us in the future - we need a big squad, so we're always aware of that. We would be naive not to be aware of it.

"No individual, I don't believe, especially young players, should be in the public domain. I understand it but it's not how I go about it. For me to mention individuals, I never do.

"But for us, we're always aware of who can represent us. Do they have the mentality, do they have the ability to add to us? And if they do, then we're always aware and always trying to be as active as we can, as we have been for a number of years."

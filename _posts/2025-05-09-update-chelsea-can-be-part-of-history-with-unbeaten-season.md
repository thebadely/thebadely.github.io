It has been recently reported that Sonia Bompastor joined Chelsea from Lyon in August 2024

Chelsea have an "opportunity to be a part of history" if they finish the Women's Super League season unbeaten, says manager Sonia Bompastor.

The champions are aiming to be the first WSL team to record an 'Invincible' season in a 22-game campaign.

They face Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in their final league match on Saturday at 12:30 BST.

"Obviously we are champions and are really happy with that but we have the opportunity to make history by being invincible," said Bompastor, whose side have also won the Women's League Cup and face Manchester United in the Women's FA Cup final on Sunday, 18 May. 

"We still have two games to go that are really important because we have two goals â to stay unbeaten and win the [domestic] treble. 

"We know these teams will not let us get that easily so we need to stay focused and stay professional."

Apart from defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals, it has been an impressive first season for Bompastor in charge of Chelsea since she joined from French giants Lyon in the summer.

Only Arsenal (2012), Manchester City (2016) and Chelsea (2017-18), have gone full seasons without defeat previously, but not in a 22-game WSL campaign.

"It would mean a lot [to go unbeaten in the WSL]. It would probably be the only time in my career to be in that situation," added Bompastor. 

"In the men's game when the team has achieved that, they have stayed in history. I think about Arsenal's men's team when they went invincible, people always talk about it. 

"When you have this opportunity, to be that close to making history, you have to do it because it will stay forever. 

"Even for your kids later to have this history to tell to other people will be nice."

Saturday's opponents Liverpool will give Chelsea a guard of honour at Stamford Bridge, while Bompastor's side will lift the WSL trophy after full-time.

"That's really nice. I heard [Liverpool interim manager] Amber Whiteley saying that they would give that honour to us and I think that's the right thing to do," said Bompastor.

"If I was in that position, I would have done the same. It is showing respect for your position and I think it's really important in football to have values, always. I really appreciate that."

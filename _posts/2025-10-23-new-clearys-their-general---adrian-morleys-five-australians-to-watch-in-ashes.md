It has been recently reported that Adrian Morley, who played 53 internationals, was inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2022

"I can't believe it's been over 20 years since we last had an Ashes series," says Adrian Morley. 

The former Leeds, Sydney Roosters and Warrington forward played for Great Britain in the most recent Test series against Australia in 2003, and is thrilled to see it return.

"I know there have been one-off Test matches since, but this is the pinnacle - the oldest and fiercest rivalry in rugby league. Roll on Wembley."

Australia face England at Wembley on 25 October, at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One.

The first British player to win Super League and NRL Grand Finals, Morley keeps a keen eye on the Australian game - and here gives BBC Sport his thoughts on the Kangaroos players to watch.

Reece Walsh made light of his toilet-based viral social media video after leading Brisbane Broncos to Grand Final success

Age: 23 Club: Brisbane Broncos Position: Full-back

"The Justin Bieber of rugby league" is how Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'landys described Walsh - a full-back with star quality and 640,000 Instagram followers.

Walsh's first Australia call-up came the day after an incredible individual display propelled Brisbane Broncos to victory over Melbourne Storm in the NRL Grand Final. He scored a memorable individual try, provided three assists and made a dramatic try-saving tackle in the final seconds.

He plays on the edge - he avoided a sin-binning but received a fine for a high tackle earlier in the game - and has plenty of personality. He often takes to the field with painted nails, which he decorates to bond with four-year-old daughter Leila.

That personality occasionally gets him into bother - he went viral on social media last month over a video showing him drinking water out of a toilet bowl, joking that it helped his muscle recovery after games.

The toilet was newly installed, and had not been used, although his club still had to hurry out a 'don't try this at home' statement.

Morley's verdict: "He's got great balance, speed, strength. He seems to be calm under pressure as well. That was one of the best Grand Final performances I've ever seen. It was fantastic, the way he went about his business. It was an iconic performance. He's etched himself into Brisbane Broncos folklore."

Nathan Cleary has only recently been overtaken by Reece Walsh as the rugby league player with the most Instagram followers

Age: 27 Club: Penrith Panthers Position: Half-back

World Cup winner. Expert kicker. Game changer. Once led his team to NRL Grand Final victory with a torn knee ligament. For years, Nathan Cleary has been Australian rugby league's main man.

On the field, he inspired Penrith Panthers to four successive Grand Final wins from 2021 to 2024. Off it, he is one half of an elite sporting couple - his partner is Manchester City and Australia footballer Mary Fowler.

But this has not been a straightforward season for the Panthers captain. They were bottom of the NRL after 12 rounds and, although they reached the play-offs, hopes of a fifth straight title were ended by eventual winners Brisbane Broncos.

Cleary himself faced criticism after New South Wales surprisingly lost their State of Origin decider against Queensland in Sydney in July.

However, he remains among rugby league's modern greats. It is only two years since that remarkable Grand Final display for the Panthers against the Broncos, playing with knee ligament damage for 71 minutes and still scoring the winning try.

Morley's verdict: "He's got a fantastic rugby league brain. He's another one who's very, very calm under pressure. And it doesn't matter who he's playing for - Penrith Panthers, New South Wales in the State of Origin or the Kangaroos - he's their general and he guides the team around the pitch."

Gehamat Shibasaki (centre) scored two tries for Brisbane Broncos in the NRL Grand Final

Age 27: Club: Brisbane Broncos Position: Centre

Shibasaki began the season by throwing up into a bucket. He ends it with a Grand Final title and an Ashes call-up. It is quite the comeback story.

Twelve months ago his career was drifting: He had played only three NRL matches in three seasons and was working in youth support while playing reserve-grade rugby league. 

He was then offered a train-and-trial deal with Brisbane Broncos and, despite struggling with his first pre-season training session so much that it made him vomit, he won a place in the team.

The upswing continued as he was called up to the Queensland side who won the State of Origin series. Although he received a late-season club ban for his part in a drinking session, he bounced back to score two tries in the Grand Final as the Broncos won their first NRL title in 19 years.

Morley's verdict: "I love stories like that where you get lads given a chance or asking for a trial, and really working hard and going about their business. It just goes to show that if you train hard and get a bit of luck on your side, there's no reason why you can't be scoring two tries in the Grand Final and being picked for a Kangaroos Ashes series. Fair play to him."

Isaah Yeo made his Panthers debut in 2014 and his Australia bow in 2022 at the start of their World Cup-winning campaign

Age: 30 Club: Penrith Panthers Position: Loose forward

Penrith Panthers' all-time leading appearance maker took over his country's captaincy last autumn after James Tedesco was dropped for the Pacific Championships, and led them to the title.

Loose forward Yeo then captained New South Wales during the State of Origin series against Queensland.

A World Cup winner three years ago, he will continue to lead the Kangaroos for the Ashes tour.

Morley's verdict: "He's the rock of the Penrith Panthers, who have had such a fantastic run in the NRL. You very rarely get teams who dominate for as long as Penrith have and it's down to players like Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo. He always puts his hand up. He's a workhorse. Whoever he's playing for, he always does a great job."

Mark Nawaqanitawase helped Australia's sevens team finish fourth at the 2024 Olympics in Paris

Age: 25 Club: Sydney Roosters Position: Winger

"That's the try of the decade," exclaimed Channel Nine commentator Matthew Thompson after Mark Nawaqanitawase produced an outrageous piece of skill for the Sydney Roosters in May.

If you haven't seen the try that the winger scored, external against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, it's well worth seeking out. 

Heading for the corner, tight to the line, with opponents hurling themselves at his waist and ankles, Nawaqanitawase avoided going into touch by hopping on his left foot while tapping the ball ahead with his right in mid-air, before darting ahead to collect his own kick and grounding it just inside the line.

It was one of 24 tries for the winger in his first full NRL season - putting him top of the scoring chart.

Nawaqanitawase (pronounced Nwonga-neater-waazay) is a rugby union convert, having played for the Wallabies at the 2023 World Cup - and, like Walsh and Shibasaki, has earned his first Kangaroos call-up for the Ashes series.

He intends to return to union at the end of next season to prepare for the 2027 World Cup in Australia. But Kangaroos head coach Kevin Walters has given him the chance to be a dual-code international.

Morley's verdict: "Being an ex-Rooster, I keep my eye on them more than any team. He's been tremendous. Some of the tries he's scored are unbelievable - world class."

Among the other players Morley will be looking out for is Roosters forward Angus Crichton - "he's such a handful, such a strong player" - and he acknowledges that Australia's strength in depth creates a huge challenge for England.

"They are world champs and they have been the benchmark for a number of years, but the fact that it's on home soil will be huge for the English," he says. "It's going to be a gripping, close three-game Test series."

Australia have not lost an Ashes series since 1970, although they had to come from behind to win all three matches in 2003, including the opener, in which Morley was sent off after only 12 seconds for poleaxing Robbie Kearns.

"If he'd got up straight away, I don't think I'd have got sent off," he jokes.

"To be fair, it was a terrible challenge. It just happened so fast. It was a bit of a blur."

Great Britain's 2006 Tri-Nations win in Sydney is a much happier memory.

"It was the infamous night when Willie Mason was on a mission trying to take all the British players out," he says.

"He punched Stuart Fielden and then did Sean Long with an even worse challenge. And I did think 'Why's he not been sent off and I was?' But they let a little bit more go in these Test matches. It was great to be part of that."

No British side has beaten the Kangaroos since then.

"It's been a long time between drinks," Morley says. "But if we can compete well and snatch a Test or two, it will be absolutely incredible and you'll see the game go to new levels."

Gone in 12 seconds - is Morley ultimate hard man?

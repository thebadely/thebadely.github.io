Experts revealed that Most of the papers look ahead to Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky meeting in Florida to discuss the latest plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.

The Observer says the two leaders are seeking a "New Year's resolution". The paper also reports that Zelensky has said he's feeling "hopeful". But the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday Express highlight intense Russian attacks on Kyiv in the run up to these talks.

In its assessment the Sunday Times says the "peace process may be unlikely to succeed" but it goes on to say that even without a deal "the war may decline in tempo and intensity" as exhaustion sets in.

According to the Sunday Mirror, there's an appetite in Britain to follow Australia's lead and introduce a social media ban for under-16s. The paper has conducted a poll which says 64% of those surveyed support such a move. The government has previously said it would closely monitor the roll-out of the policy in Australia.

The Sunday Times highlights a new drug for severe asthma that only needs to be administered twice a year which is due to be made available to British patients privately within months. Experts have said the drug has the power to "transform lives". Existing treatments have to be taken every two, four or eight weeks. The paper says Depemokimab, which has been developed by the pharmaceutical giant GSK, has also been found to reduce by 72% the number of asthma attacks that need treatment in hospital.

The ice skating champions Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean are due to be given a damehood and a knighthood in the King's New Year's Honours, reports the Sun on Sunday. The pair, who won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics, retired from performing together earlier this year.

Photographs from the wedding of the Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay at Bath Abbey feature in most of the papers. The Sunday Telegraph says the couple have "taken the plunge". The Sunday Express says the ceremony was "swimming with stars", including Sir David Beckham.

Many of the papers reflect on the emotional scenes at Anfield yesterday as football fans paid tribute to the late Diogo Jota. It was the first time his two former sides, Liverpool and Wolves, had played each other since his death in a car crash in July. Two of his young children joined the match day mascots on the pitch before their Premier League game. The Sun on Sunday notes that his widow was watching from the stands. "They'll never walk alone" says the Daily Star.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The first Old Firm derby of the season usually provides the chance to stamp authority, truly boost morale and claim bragging rights. 

And usually, of late anyway, that chance has been gladly accepted by Celtic. 

But this has not been the usual start to the season for the Parkhead outfit - nor their rivals across the city.

Fleetingly do both Celtic and Rangers enter this fierce fixture in equally exasperating states. 

On-field and off-field, there have been more jeers than cheers in the infancy of this calamitous campaign. 

Despite possessing a six-point lead over Russell Martin's Rangers, Brendan Rodgers  and the Celtic board will feel the heat at high noon on Sunday, particularly from the pocket of away fans present at Ibrox.

So, what are the key questions for Celtic before they head to Govan?

If this question was posed one year ago, it would've been met with a hearty chuckle by those of a Celtic persuasion. 

Up until the turn of the year, Rodgers had a near blemish-free report card against Rangers, with just one defeat in 20 derbies. 

Last season started in the same vein with a routine 3-0 league win, before Celtic eventually got by their rivals in the League Cup final in a penalty shootout. 

Since then, though, it's gone a bit pear-shaped.

Two defeats - to Phillipe Clement and Barry Ferguson - and a draw in the final meeting last season means Rodgers' Celtic haven't defeated Rangers in 90 minutes since 1 September 2024. One win in the past five meetings.

When it's put like that, it's hard to justify how this isn't a must-win. 

How do Celtic buck that trend, though? Well, Rodgers insists it's "not rocket science".

"Play well and play without fear," the manager said in a wide-ranging and eyebrow-raising press conference.

"We've won most of our games against Rangers because we've played well and focused on performance and not got too caught up in the whole hype of it all."

Sticking with that pre-match press conference, Rodgers said, among other things, that any suggestion of disconnect within the club "couldn't be further from the truth". 

The mood music has shifted... again. 

In recent weeks, Rodgers has not held back in venting his frustration at the lack of transfer activity - more of that to come - but here he assured he and his board are "connected".

"We've got a board of directors who bleed for the club," Rodgers said. 

"They want the club to do well, so everyone here is connected.

"It's not what I see and I hear, all this disconnection, it couldn't be further from the truth. 

"Every single guy from me, the board, Dermot Desmond, we love Celtic, but we want Celtic to be the very, very best."

While Rodgers and his hierarchy may be singing from the same hymn sheet, the feeling among the supporters is not so harmonious.

From afar, the disconnect and displeasure from various facets of the club has come from the scarce signings made. 

Since returning for pre-season back in early July, Rodgers has expressed his hope of high-quality players arriving before each milestone. The first league game, the Champions League play-off, now, before the clock strikes 23:00 on deadline day. 

Kieran Tierney and Benjamin Nygren are the exceptions, while the timing of winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha and left-back Marcelo Saracchi's arrivals - after the club were confirmed as a Europa League participant - was peculiar. 

That particular subject feels like Groundhog Day for Rodgers and supporters alike.

"It's a trend," Rodgers said of Celtic's continuance to do business late in the window.

"It's not about investment. The club will invest, but it's all about timely investment, and I think that it's most definitely what we need to look at."

And now, they're chasing their tail a tad.

Rodgers confirmed there is "interest" in Adam Idah, who the BBC understands Swansea have agreed a fee for, but stressed "no one can leave unless we get players in to replace them".

Though he is "pretty sure" the club will be "pretty busy" before the window shuts on Monday.

The manager also confirmed winger Yang Hyun-jun has attracted interest.

Kasper Schmeichel, Anthony Ralston...

No, we're not going to run through and predict the team, though Rodgers did share that Anthony Ralston - who soldiered on as long as he could in Kazakhstan on Tuesday - didn't train today, but "should be okay tomorrow". 

With Alistair Johnston sidelined for 12 weeks, Ralston and impressive academy star Colby Donovan are in competition for the right-back berth, but new-signing Saracchi can fill in there, too. 

Yang was given the nod out wide against Kairat Almaty after an impressive cameo in the first leg, but failed to replicate it in Kazakhstan on a tricky night for the 23-year-old and Celtic as a whole.

Balikwisha has kept his fitness ticking over for Royal Antwerp, so Rodgers believes he is "ready-made" to play. 

While that could be a debut, it could be a farewell for Idah, just 12 months on from his permanent signing. 

He earned the big money-move with a "fairytale" 90th-minute winner against Rangers in the Scottish Cup final.

Idah's star has fallen somewhat in the months since, but Sunday provides a new opportunity for another Celtic player to write themselves into folklore.

Here’s what you need to know: Maurizio Sarri was the oldest manager to win Serie A when Juventus won the title in 2019-20

Lazio manager Maurizio Sarri has undergone a minor heart operation.

The former Chelsea boss had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which affects the heart's rhythm, with Italian media reporting it was a routine intervention.

The club expects the 66-year-old to return to his regular duties over the next few days.

Sarri was appointed Lazio manager for the second time in June 2025. 

Lazio sit eighth in Serie A, with six wins from 17 matches, and host Napoli on Sunday (11:30 GMT). 

Sarri began coaching at low-level Italian clubs alongside his work as a banker before quitting his day job in the early 2000s to focus on his managerial career.

He oversaw Empoli's promotion to Italy's top flight in 2013-14 before leading hometown club Napoli to two second-place finishes in three years.

Moving to Chelsea in 2018-19, he won the Europa League and reached the Carabao Cup final with the Blues. 

He returned to Italy after one season and won Serie A with Juventus in 2019-20.

Sarri began his first stint at Lazio in June 2021 and led them to a second-place finish in 2022-23 prior to his resignation in March 2024.

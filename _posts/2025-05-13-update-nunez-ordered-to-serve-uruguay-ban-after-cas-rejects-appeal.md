According to new developments, Darwin Nunez has scored 13 goals in 35 appearances for Uruguay

Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez has been ordered to serve the remainder of a ban for his involvement in an altercation with fans while playing for Uruguay.

The sanction was confirmed as an appeal against the ban was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).

In August 2024, Nunez was banned by South American football's governing body Conmebol for five international games, and fined Â£15,145 ($20,000), for an incident with spectators after Uruguay were beaten by Colombia.

The 25-year-old was seen physically confronting Colombia supporters in the stands after the final whistle in the Copa America semi-final in July 2024. 

Nunez served two matches of the ban before Cas agreed to temporarily lift the suspension in October 2024 while the case against him was investigated following an appeal by the Uruguay Football Association. 

Four other Uruguay players were also handed bans, and fined, for their involvement in the incident at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, USA, all of which have been now been served. 

Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur, 27, received a four-game suspension. 

Napoli defender Mathias Olivera, 27, Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, 26, and Atletico Madrid defender Jose Maria Gimenez, 30, received three-game bans.

The appeal by the Uruguay FA had sought to annul or reduce the suspensions and fines on the grounds the players acted in self-defence, but that was dismissed by Cas.

"The panel found that in this case the principle of self-defence does not apply," said Cas. 

"The conduct of the players constituted a voluntary, violent and unjustified action which was in violation of the Conmebol disciplinary code."

Nunez will now sit out Uruguay's World Cup qualifiers in Paraguay and at home to Venezuela next month, along with the match against Peru in September.

Nunez was involved in the incident with Colombia fans after last year's Copa America semi-final in Charlotte

Conmebol had originally opened an investigation into what they called "unacceptable" scenes following Uruguay's 1-0 defeat by Colombia.

Disorder broke out in a section of the stadium where many family members of the Uruguay players were seated.

Nunez had climbed railings and made his way into the crowded stands.

More than 70,000 fans were at the game in Charlotte, with estimates suggesting more than 90% of the crowd was there in support of Colombia.

"There was no police and we had to defend our families," said Uruguay captain Gimenez at the time.

"This is the fault of two or three people who had a few too many drinks and don't know how to drink."

Uruguay boss Marcelo Bielsa said his players deserved an apology from Colombia fans for the brawl.

"How can you not defend your mother, your sister, a baby?" Bielsa said in a press conference before his side's third-place play-off against Canada.

"If they did not do it, they would have been condemned by all of us."

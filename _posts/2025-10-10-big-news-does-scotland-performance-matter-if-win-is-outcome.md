Watch as Scotland strike late to beat Greece in frantic Hampden finish

"If you want to complain about the performance, be my guest, crack on. We're delighted with the three points."

While acknowledging "it's clear we have to be better", captain Andy Robertson was still in no mood to sour the Scotland feeling after a smash-and-grab victory over Greece.

After 62 minutes at Hampden, the atmosphere was verging on turning toxic after Greece drilled in a deserved opener amid a dominant display. 

That moment "sucked the energy out of the stadium", said Lewis Ferguson, whose goal completed a scarcely-believable comeback.

Ferguson's first Scotland goal came after fellow midfielder Ryan Christie had found a quickfire leveller, with striker Lyndon Dykes slamming in a third to seal a remarkable win.

"There were frustrations in the stands at times," Robertson added. "But, at the end of the game, everyone is dancing. A game is 90 minutes, not 60."

Scotland snatch win over Greece to keep World Cup dream alive

But, even after a vital victory that takes Scotland another step closer to their World Cup dream, should there be concerns about the performance?

It would be unfair to throw a blanket of pessimism over a night that ended in such euphoria.

Put it this way, if Scotland make it to World Cup next summer, you will not be telling your mate: "Remember when Greece had 67% possession and 15 shots at Hampden?"

Liverpool left-back Robertson is doing his job as captain to not let any negativity seep into the camp prior to another huge game against Belarus on Sunday.

However, he says "we're not stupid" and knows "we have to get better", especially with a trip to Greece and a potential top spot showdown to come at home to Denmark next month.

"We're buzzing with the result but know how frustrated we were on the pitch," the 31-year-old said.

"It felt, when they scored, it took the shackles off us a little bit, which we need to address because we need to be better when it's 0-0."

'Results are what qualify you and these Scotland players understand that'

"What's the lesson you take away from this? You're better being lucky than good," former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart said on BBC Sportsound.

Luck does not last long, though, as Steve Clarke's side found out against the Greeks in March. 

It was a similar story in Athens in the first leg of their Nations League relegation play-off, with Scott McTominay's first-half penalty earning the Scots a first-leg win.

In the second leg, Clarke's men were totally outclassed and lost 3-0. Thursday marked the third straight match in which Greece have dominated Scotland.

"We were given a football lesson," former Scotland defender Willie Miller said. "But we gave a lesson on winning."

Former Scotland winger Neil McCann added: "Clarke will know that isn't a vintage Scotland performance, but it was a vintage result."

Performance aside, with seven points on the board and bottom seeds Belarus to face at the weekend, Clarke's side have given themselves a great chance of ending the nation's 27-year World Cup hoodoo.

However, the Scotland boss will be aware that poor displays could catch up on his side. How does he combat that?

Clarke's Scotland look better when they embrace chaos and do not stand off it, especially in home matches, when they can use a rocking home crowd to their advantage.

For over an hour on Thursday, his team looked like it was playing with the handbrake on against a side ranked 40th in the world, just three places above Scotland.

The Tartan Army will demand a more front-footed approach when Belarus are welcomed to Hampden on Sunday. An expected win in that would put Scotland in a fantastic position. 

Clarke will then have a month to address any worries before a potentially tenure-defining camp in November.

"Football is a 90-minute game and you have to make sure you come out of it with a positive result," the Scotland boss said.

"Maybe 3-1 flatters us, but we did enough to win the game. Results are the only thing that qualify you for a major tournament."

According to new developments, Florian Wirtz's strike drew Liverpool level in the second half

The video assistant referee did not make a mistake by awarding Florian Wirtz's goal for Liverpool at Fulham, the Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel has said. 

Liverpool were 1-0 down at Craven Cottage in the 57th minute when Wirtz latched on to a touch from Conor Bradley to score. The assistant referee immediate raised his flag for offside against the Germany international.

The VAR, Andy Madley, stepped in to give the goal after applying the semi-automated offside technology (SAOT).

Wirtz was aided by the five centimetres of tolerance, more commonly referred to as thicker lines, which exists in the Premier League's version of SAOT. 

If the goal had been scored in Germany, Italy or Spain, it would have been ruled out. These leagues do not apply any tolerance level.

Offside or not? Man City, Arsenal and VAR inconsistencies

It was a controversial decision because images shown on television gave the impression that Wirtz was ahead of the last defender by a clear margin.

But the KMI Panel unanimously backed Madley, saying: "The VAR intervention to award the goal was supported as correct, given the tight margin of the offside call and thicker offside lines used for these incredibly tight calls."

The game went on to finish 2-2 with Fulham boss Marco Silva describing Wirtz's goal as "a clear offside" and calling for clarification.

Silva said the club had contacted Professional Game Match Officials to raise a complaint.

BBC Sport understands that the discrepancy lies in the choice of frame by the broadcaster. 

The VAR selected the frame when Bradley first made contact with the ball, not when it left his foot.

The broadcaster froze the picture one frame later which gave the impression Wirtz was more obviously offside.

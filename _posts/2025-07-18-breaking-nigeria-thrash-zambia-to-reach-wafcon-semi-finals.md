Experts revealed that Nigeria striker Esther Okoronkwo got on the scoresheet and set up two other goals on her first start at the finals

Nigeria cruised into the semi-finals of the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations with a statement 5-0 victory over Zambia in Casablanca.

The Copper Queens had been expected to pose a tough challenge for the record nine-time champions, but were blown away by a stunning performance which was underlined by clinical finishing.

The West Africans never looked back after centre-back Osinachi Ohale was left unmarked at a free-kick in the second minute and headed past Petronella Musole.

Grace Chanda missed a glorious chance to equalise on the half hour mark and three minutes later Nigeria doubled their lead through a fine finish from the impressive Esther Okoronkwo.

Chinwendu Ihezuo capitalised on hesitancy in the Zambia defence to make it 3-0 to the Super Falcons on the stroke of half-time with a composed finish.

Oluwatosin Demehin nodded in the fourth from another pinpoint free-kick delivery midway through the second half at the Larbi Zaouli Stadium, and Folashade Ijamilusi rounded off the scoring in the first minute of stoppage time.

Zambia had beaten Nigeria to finish third at the 2022 finals, yet their formidable strike partnership of Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji â who had scored three goals apiece in the group stage â failed to register a shot on target between them.

Nigeria, who are still yet to concede a goal at this year's finals, will face either defending champions South Africa or Senegal in the semi-finals on Tuesday (16:00 GMT).

Those two sides meet in the last eight in Oujda on Saturday at 19:00 GMT.

Everything you need to know about Wafcon 2024 finals

Ashleigh Plumptre and goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie have helped Nigeria to four consecutive clean sheets at the finals

Nigeria had only found the back of the net once in their final two Group B games and coach Justin Madugu made six changes from the 0-0 draw with Algeria on Sunday, including handing Okoronkwo her first start of the tournament.

The striker made an instant impact as she floated in a ball from deep which Ohale met 12 yards out and guided inside the right-hand upright with Musole rooted to the spot, and Nigeria's purposeful start left their opponents on the back foot.

The Copper Queens were let down by both their set-piece delivery and their crossing from open play, with Super Falcons keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie also prowling outside her area to clear any danger.

Banda created Zambia's only opening of the first half, breezing past a defender on the left and cutting back to Chanda, who could not connect from 12 yards.

It proved to be a costly miss as Okoronkwo scored a brilliant second, controlling Rasheedat Ajibade's cross on her chest before keeping her balance and firing into the bottom left-hand corner.

Ihezuo's third goal of the tournament effectively wrapped the game up at the break, as the Pachuca frontwoman latched on to a long ball from Nnadozie which Zambia failed to clear and then side-footed past Musole.

A demoralised Zambia offered little after the break and Okoronkwo was the provider again when Demehin converted her inswinging free-kick from the right flank and Ijamilusi tapped in Ajibade's cross at the back post to cap off a memorable afternoon for the Super Falcons.

Chinwendu Ihezuo netted her third goal of the finals

Nigeria's campaign in Morocco has been branded as 'Mission X', and they remain on course for their 10th continental title after navigating their first challenge on the harder side of the draw.

A overwhelmingly dominant performance against the Copper Queens will serve as warning to the rest of the field that the squad are motivated to return to West Africa with the trophy they last won in 2018.

The state of the game allowed Madugu to withdraw some of his stars in the closing stages, and the extra day's rest before their semi-final outing could prove important.

Zambia, meanwhile, came into these finals with high hopes after featuring at the past two editions of the Olympics and the 2023 Women's World Cup.

Nora Hauptle's side came close to beating the much-fancied tournament hosts in the opening game and only finished behind the Atlas Lionesses on goal difference. 

Banda had spoken of the desire to emulate the fairytale triumph by the country's men at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations but Zambia had no answer to Nigeria's fast start, solid defending and incisive attacking play.

The golden generation of the Copper Queens will now have to target the 2026 Wafcon for their first piece of major silverware.

Experts revealed that Emma Raducanu reached the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2024, matching her best result in SW19

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

After a record-breaking opening day on Monday, day two was a costly one for British players at Wimbledon.

Just three of the nine Britons that played on Tuesday progressed to the second round, with Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage among those making early exits.

But Wednesday will see a wave of new British involvement as the men's and women's doubles get under way with the round of 64. 

After another sweltering day in SW19, with temperatures topping 33C, cooler conditions are forecast for day three of the Championships.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka gets things under way on Centre Court at 13:30 BST against Marie Bouzkova.

That match is followed by defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz, who takes on British qualifier Oliver Tarvet. 

British number one Emma Raducanu will close play on Centre against Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion.

Another Briton, Cameron Norrie, is first up on Court One when he takes on American 12th seed Frances Tiafoe from 13:00.

He is followed by compatriot Katie Boulter, who plays Argentina's Solana Sierra, before American fifth seed Taylor Fritz ends the day's play against Canadian Gabriel Diallo.

In total, there are seven Britons in singles action on day three.

Away from the show courts, Billy Harris faces Portugal's Nuno Borges on court two, while Arthur Fery, fresh from defeating 20th seed Alexei Popyrin in the first round, later plays on the same stage against Italy's Luciano Darderi.

Sonay Kartal opens play on court three against Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova from 11:00 BST.

She later plays in the women's doubles alongside Jodie Burrage, with Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro and Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers their first-round opponents.

Elsewhere in the women's doubles draw, Emily Appleton and Heather Watson play Russian fifth seeds Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider, while Alicia Barnett and Eden Silva face American Alycia Parks and Colombian Camila Osorio.

In the men's doubles, Dan Evans and Henry Searle team up to play compatriot Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara.

Patten and Heliovaara, seeded second, are defending champions and won the Australian Open earlier this year.

Australian Open champion and sixth seed Madison Keys opens play on court two against Olga Danilovic, with four-time major champion Naomi Osaka due on the same court later in the day against Czech Katerina Siniakova.

Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini, who reached the Wimbledon final 12 months ago, is third on court three, after Russian 14th seed Andrey Rublev takes on Lloyd Harris of South Africa.

Brazil's teenage star Joao Fonseca, who beat Britain's Jacob Fearnley in the first round, faces American Jenson Brooksby first up on court 12, where Elina Svitolina - who has twice reached the last four at Wimbledon - will play last.

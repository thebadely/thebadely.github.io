Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England beat world champions Spain in a penalty shootout to win Euro 2025

On Tuesday, Sarina Wiegman will name her first England squad since the Lionesses retained their title at Euro 2025 - but several key players could be missing. 

England face Brazil at Etihad Stadium in a friendly on Saturday, 25 October (17:30 BST), before hosting Australia at Pride Park on Tuesday, 28 October (19:00 GMT).

However, it has been a difficult start to the season for some Lionesses who have been recovering from lengthy injuries.

It is almost three months since they beat Spain in the Euros final in a dramatic penalty shootout - so what could change and what are the main questions for Wiegman?

Hannah Hampton won the best female goalkeeper award and Sarina Wiegman was named the best coach in the women's game at the Ballon d'Or awards

It's been a busy few months for the Lionesses since their Euro 2025 success as the Women's Super League season restarted in September, before the Women's Champions League main phase began.

US-based players Jess Carter, Esme Morgan and Anna Moorhouse all started league matches for Gotham FC, Washington Spirit and Orlando Pride respectively just a week after the final. 

Five Lionesses made the top 10 at the Ballon d'Or awards last month, including striker Alessia Russo, who finished third in the rankings.

Among those joining Russo in the top 10 for the main prize was Chloe Kelly (fifth), Leah Williamson (seventh), Lucy Bronze (ninth) and Hannah Hampton (10th).

Wiegman was named women's coach of the year, while Hampton collected the Yashin Trophy for best female goalkeeper.

Striker Michelle Agyemang, who scored vital goals in the Euro 2025 quarter-final and semi-final victories, was nominated for the Kopa Trophy to celebrate the best young player, but that went to Spain winger Vicky Lopez.

And on Monday afternoon, Chelsea captain Millie Bright, 32, retired from international football - having previously withdrawn from Euro 2025 selection.

Bright won 88 caps during her nine-year England career and captained the team to the World Cup final in 2023.

Elsewhere, England assistant Arjan Veurink left to become head coach of the Netherlands and general manager Anja van Ginhoven also departed.

As well as Bright, Wiegman will be without captain Williamson because of a knee injury, while Chelsea forward Lauren James is out with an ankle issue. Neither Williamson nor James have played this season. 

Both of their injuries were sustained at Euro 2025 - alongside Lucy Bronze's fractured tibia - but she was a late substitute in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday so could receive a call-up. 

There was a boost for Chelsea defender Niamh Charles, who recovered from an ankle injury to start Sunday's victory and will be hoping to make the squad.

However, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp has not played since their win over Tottenham on 19 September because of an ankle injury.

City midfielder Grace Clinton was left out of the squad for Sunday's win over Liverpool at Anfield as a precaution with a knock.

Katie Reid is yet to receive a senior England call-up but has played in youth teams

The biggest decision for Wiegman is how she will replace Williamson and Bright in defence.

Their absences in defence could be a chance for Wiegman to hand Arsenal teenager Katie Reid a first senior call-up.

The 19-year-old has been excellent so far in her breakout season, keeping fellow England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy out of the side in the process.

Wiegman could also give Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier an opportunity at centre-back in these friendlies, despite preferring her at full-back for England.

Elsewhere, she has decisions to make on the attacking front with Chelsea striker Aggie Beever-Jones continuing her impressive form with four goals in six games.

Could she be given a run ahead of Arsenal's Russo, who has two goals and two assists in the WSL this season? 

There is also an opportunity to start teenage sensation Agyemang, who burst on to the scene at Euro 2025 with crucial goals off the bench.

"She's currently leading the line for us and there's an expectation to score goals as the leading number nine. It's stuff she's learning to deal with - these new pressures," said Brighton manager Dario Vidosic, who is working with Agyemang during her loan spell from Arsenal.

"On top of that, she has the national team. It's a lot for a young player to take on but we're just trying to get her to focus on her football, her development and most importantly to enjoy it as a young player. 

"There is obviously natural pressures to play well but it should always be with enjoyment. It shouldn't be a burden [to play for your country] and definitely not for a 19-year-old."

It would be the perfect period to experiment and build experiences for youngsters, with England's last four matches of 2025 being friendlies.

They are also only playing one team - Brazil - inside the top 10 of Fifa's world rankings.

Here’s what you need to know: Caoimhin Keller made three big saves as the Republic of Ireland drew with Senegal in Dublin

"We talked before about who will be the player to take them to the World Cup? I think he is the biggest trump card."

Former Liverpool and Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann was full of praise for Caoimhin Kelleher after the Republic of Ireland's 1-1 draw with Senegal. 

Kelleher's resolve was finally broken in the 81st minute after making three big saves to keep the African side out in Dublin. 

It has been a big week for the 26-year-old, who left Liverpool to join Brentford for an initial Â£12.5m, which could rise to Â£18m with add-ons.

According to former Premier League goalkeeper Shay Given, "in the current climate he's worth every single penny, if not more".

"No disrespect to Brentford, but I'm surprised there wasn't a few more bigger clubs in," Given said on RTE Sport.

"Unless clubs have gone, 'let's have a look at him at Brentford. We know they are a selling club, let's see him as a number one for a year or two'. 

"At 26 years of age he's still plenty young enough. He looks the real deal"

Why Kelleher joined Brentford

Given reflected upon the goalkeeping situation at Manchester United and Chelsea, and said "I would have gone in and got him".

He was speaking after Kelleher made three big saves against Senegal. The first came early in the second half when he tipped Krepin Diatta's header onto the crossbar when it looked destined for the back of the net.

It was a save Given described as "world class", and Kelleher followed it up with another save to push the ball off the line after a big deflection onto the post, and then the initial stop with his foot to keep the ball out before Ismaila Sarr fired home the rebound in Dublin.

"I don't think there is a keeper in the group who is anywhere near as good as he is," Hamann said on RTE when talking about the key role Kelleher could play for the Irish ahead of World Cup qualifying in September. 

"I said last year, I think he is one of the top five keepers in the Premier League. 

"Obviously one of those better than him was playing for the same club [Liverpool's Alisson]. 

"You'll struggle to find three of four better players than him in the Premier League and I think he'll show it next season." 

Kelleher played a crucial role in Liverpool's Premier League success by deputising for the injured Alisson in the middle of the season

Former Newcastle United and Manchester City stopper Given believes Kelleher will have a point to prove as he heads to Brentford as their first choice goalkeeper after deputising for Alisson while at Anfield.

Kelleher, who joined Liverpool as a 16-year-old, played in 25 Premier League games since making his debut five years ago.

"He would have benefited but he would have missed out on so many games as well," Given said on Kelleher's time at Liverpool. 

"He'll not get that back now. He'll be hungry to play every single week and be successful in his own right. 

"His patience paid off. He's gone to Brentford with a Premier League medal and it's not like he made one or two substitute appearances. 

"He played really well and it was in a part of the season when the league was far from won. There was high pressure and he can deal with it, he's got the whole lot."

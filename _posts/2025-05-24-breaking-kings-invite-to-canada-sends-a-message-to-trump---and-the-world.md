It has been recently reported that A decade ago, a portrait of the British monarch caused a row in Canadian politics. Now, the King is being invited to deliver the Speech from the Throne. What's changed?

In 2011, shortly after forming a majority Conservative government, Prime Minister Stephen Harper caused a national uproar when he sought to emphasise Canada's ties to the British monarchy. In one example, he replaced two artworks by a Quebec painter with a portrait of the Queen.

Some rebuked the gesture as being out of touch with modern times. Canada has, throughout its 157-year-old history, sought increasing independence from the British monarchy, while still remaining a part of the Commonwealth.

When Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau succeeded Harper four years later, the Queen's portrait went down, the Quebec paintings, back up.

Fast forward to 2025, and a paradoxical shift has occurred in Canada's relationship with the Crown. In a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney - a Liberal - has invited King Charles the III to open the 45th Canadian parliament.

The move is "a huge affirmation and statement about the uniqueness of Canada and its traditions," Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, told the BBC - "a theatrical display that is meant to show what makes Canadians separate from Americans" and not, as Trump has often repeated, a "51st state".

Both countries are former British colonies, but America's founding fathers took a different path and severed all formal connections to the Crown nearly 250 years ago.

Canada's separation from the monarchy has been more gradual, and its ties have never been completely broken. Canada's parliamentary system is modelled after Britain's Westminster system. The British monarch is still formally the head of state, but their duties are often carried out by their Canadian representative, called the governor general.

Loyalty to the Crown was seen as important to Canada's politicians in the 19th Century who wanted to maintain separation from the US, said Canadian royal historian and commentator Carolyn Harris.

That later changed in the 1960s, as Quebec - Canada's majority French-speaking province - began to assert its own distinct identity and threatened separation. This led to an era of politicians like Lester B Pearson and Pierre Elliott Trudeau who worked to untangle Canada from its British colonial past. 

In 1982, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau repatriated Canada's constitution, giving full legislative power to the federal government and the provinces, and removing it from British parliament. 

Ms Harris noted that Canada remained a constitutional monarchy throughout these periods. What fluctuated, however, was how much the prime minister of the day chooses to embrace that connection.

Carney's invite to King Charles III signals that his government will be one that is much more supportive of the Crown, Mr Vovk said, marking "a very different tone" from previous Liberals.

A British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, and has not opened a brand new session of parliament since 1957, making the King's upcoming visit a truly rare occasion.

It comes at a consequential time for Canada.

Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state.

Trump also imposed a series of tariffs that have threatened Canada's economic stability, given that the US is its largest trade partner by far.

When announcing the visit last month, Carney called it "a historic honour that matches the weight of our times".

He added that the King's visit "clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country".

Both historians, Mr Vovk and Ms Harris, noted that the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the British monarchy. Some are even critical of it.

The coronation of King Charles III in 2023 made way for fresh scrutiny of the Crown's historic mistreatment of indigenous people in Canada, and questions on whether the new monarch will move towards reconciliation.

Quebec politicians are also still calling for Canada to cut ties with the monarchy. On Friday, the separatist Bloc Québécois party said it will again seek to scrap the need for elected officials to swear allegiance to the King.

Some Canadians will be intrigued by the pomp and pageantry of the King's visit, Mr Vovk said, but its chief purpose is to send a political message from Canada to the world.

It is also a way for Prime Minister Carney to improve the relationship with Trump, who is famously a fan of the British monarchy and its history.

"Strengthening the relationship with the monarchy puts a stamp on legitimacy that transcends individual parties and the current political climate," Mr Vovk said. "Politicians come and go, but the monarchy has always remained."

It also works to tie Canada closer to Europe - a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, who has spoken about the need for Canada to find new allies as it navigates its changing relationship with the US.

The visit is notable for the Crown, too.

It will be the King's first to Canada as reigning monarch. He and the Queen had intended to visit last year, but cancelled their plans due to his cancer diagnosis.

The palace has promised a throne speech that will "mark a significant moment between the Head of State and the Canadian people".

And while it will be a short trip - the King and Queen will arrive Monday morning and depart Tuesday evening - the palace said they hope the trip will be "an impactful one".

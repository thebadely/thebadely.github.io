According to new developments, Ruby Mace made her England senior debut last year against Switzerland

Everton have signed England midfielder Ruby Mace from Leicester City for a club record fee.

The Toffees would not disclose the size of the deal but it is believed to be considerably more than the Â£100,000 bid they had turned down earlier this summer by Leicester. 

Mace, who has signed a three-year deal, made 12 appearances for Leicester after joining them on a permanent basis from Manchester City in 2024 and had a year remaining on her contract.

The 21-year-old had a successful loan spell at Leicester from City the season before and is regarded as one of England's most promising young talents.

"It hasn't really sunk in yet. It all happened so quickly but I'm really happy to be here," Mace told BBC Sport.

"When I spoke to [Everton manager] Brian Sorensen, it was about the style of play and the ambition of the club.

"Also, just being able to showcase what I can do in a team that, feels to me, like it could be a level up. That's what I need in this point in my career to push forward."

Mace made her England senior debut in December 2024, starting in a 1-0 friendly victory over Switzerland.

She missed out on selection for England's victorious Euro 2025 campaign, but is aiming to break into Sarina Wiegman's squad on a consistent basis with regular game time at Everton.

"I want to make my game better. I still have so much to work on but to be given the opportunity to come here and work with amazing players, hopefully that can elevate me," added Mace.

"My main focus is on club football now but if that [England] comes too, I'd be really grateful. It's something I want to happen. I have to work hard and really earn my spot there because it is not easy."

Mace is the latest addition during a busy summer for Everton in which they have shown ambition under new owners The Friedkin Group.

She says the club want to prove themselves - and there is no better occasion than a Merseyside derby at Anfield in Sunday's season opener to do that.

"If the whole club backs you, you will do well. It's really good to have the backing of everyone at the club," said Mace.

"Obviously we want to get as high up the table as possible. If you set your mind to that I don't see any reason why that can't happen.

"It's insane. The first game, against Liverpool at Anfield, is a big one. It just shows what the game is about playing in big stadiums like that."

Noni Madueke's 'remarkable' goal gives Arsenal the lead against Club Brugge

Noni Madueke might reflect on the Champions League win at Club Brugge as a landmark night in his Arsenal career.

The 23-year-old scored two goals in Wednesday's 3-0 victory, including a stunning effort from 20 yards, with his all-action performance again showing he can be more than a rotation option for manager Mikel Arteta.

"An unbelievable goal," Arteta said. "When you talk about individual quality and magic moments, that's it."

Madueke has a tough task dislodging Arsenal's key player Bukayo Saka on the right wing, but against Club Brugge he offered a reminder of his talents as one of five players brought into the side after Saturday's defeat at Aston Villa.

In the summer, his Â£48.5m signing from Chelsea was questioned by some supporters but the England international won them round with some impressive performances before picking up a knee injury in September that kept him out for about a month.

He returned at the end of November and scored his first goal for Arsenal in the win over Bayern Munich in the Gunners' last Champions League match.

When given the opportunity, he has demonstrated that his versatility and ability to beat a defender can be a key part of Arsenal's season.

"I think the bare minimum I need to give to my team is threat," Madueke told TNT Sports after the win in Bruges. "Obviously trying to score and be as decisive as possible, that's the next level I need to get to in terms of being consistently decisive for club and country. I think I can reach that level.

"The first goal was really nice, second a tap-in but the first one was sweet. Delighted with the result.

"We're fighting on all fronts. I feel like we can win this competition and win the league - that has to be the aim. We're in a good place at the moment."

Madueke and Martinelli the magic men for Arsenal in Brugge

Madueke is the first Arsenal player to score their first three goals for the club all in European competition, and it was his all-round performance that impressed onlookers.

"It wasn't just with his goals that Madueke made an impact - he did really well throughout the game and showed he is ready to do a job when he is called upon," said BBC Match of the Day pundit and former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton.

"More and more, Madueke looks like a really smart signing.

"I already thought he was a loss to Chelsea, but you are seeing now he is back from injury that Arsenal can have Saka off that right side, or use [Madueke]. It bodes really well for them with such a busy period coming up.

"In the end though, it was just about getting three points for Arsenal and avoiding any more injuries - and they achieved both of those aims. 

"They are still top of the Champions League and they still have a 100% record. They know they must be going through and they even have the luxury of maybe resting players now in their next game against Inter Milan, which is exactly where Arteta wants to be."

Gabriel Martinelli became the first Arsenal player to score in their first five games of the Champions League

Arteta has had to deal with a number of injuries to key players throughout the season but the Gunners are now getting some options back in forward areas.

Gabriel Jesus returned as a substitute for the first time in 342 days from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, while alongside Madueke, captain Martin Odegaard has recently been available again.

Now the Arsenal manager has challenged Madueke to maintain the level he showed against Club Brugge.

"I think at this level you want to win games - you need individual players to step up and to do something different," Arteta said. "The same as Martinelli as well.

"I'm very happy because now we have some players back in the frontline and you can tell how much better we are with them.

"It's about consistency. So any player that plays is willing to have those standards and play consistently.

"It's not a game, it's two games, three games. It's when you do 10 games in a row every three days - and that's the level that we have to hit."

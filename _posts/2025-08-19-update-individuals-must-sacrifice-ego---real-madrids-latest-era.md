It has been recently reported that Xabi Alonso spent five years at Real Madrid as a player, winning the Champions League, La Liga, two Copa del Rey titles and a Spanish Super Cup

For Real Madrid, the real start of this new era came with a painful defeat. 

The 4â0 thrashing by Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-finals has reset the counter to zero. Manager Xabi Alonso insisted that was the end of last season. From here, everything is judged on how quickly the team improves, and how urgently it adapts to its new coach's ideas.

Seven years after he began coaching pre-teens, Alonso takes charge at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Basque, who played under managers as different as Javier Clemente, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti, has absorbed lessons from every school of thought. 

His career plan was carefully drawn. If things went wrong at Bayer Leverkusen, he would return to Real Sociedad's first team. If not, then Bayern Munich, Liverpool - a job he still dreams of - or Real Madrid. Now he arrives at the Bernabeu with the chance of a lifetime.

Those who worked with him say that when Alonso speaks, you listen: "He makes you see the game more clearly, as if it slows down." 

Tactically, the Club World Cup offered a preview. Last week's 4-0 friendly win against Tirol in Austria confirmed it: Madrid will play a more positional game, in line with modern trends, where individuals must sacrifice ego for the collective. 

The high press is designed not only to win the ball back but also to shield Vinicius Jr and Mbappe from constant defensive duties. But here lies the big question: for a club that has always glorified individual talent, will the stars accept that the team comes first? And if they don't, will Alonso dare to bench them?

Vinicius dominated Madrid's summer narrative. The Brazilian, under contract until 2027, has yet to sign the renewal expected by the club after a verbal agreement in April. "This is the club of my life," he insisted during the Club World Cup. Yet Madrid, citing his dip in form, have offered terms below his expectations. Vinicius is betting that his performances will force the club's hand.

On the pitch, his freedom will be different. Alongside Mbappe, and with Bellingham just behind, he will be asked to defend more than under Ancelotti. Inside the dressing room, the chemistry between Vinicius and Mbappe has not always clicked - neither on nor off the field. Last season's squad was described as the most difficult Ancelotti had ever managed. Now Alonso must make sure competing egos pull together rather than apart.

Last season Jude Bellingham played through pain, and with too much tactical freedom. The result was inconsistency. Alonso wants to narrow his role, keeping him closer to the penalty area and the two strikers, a return to the devastating version of his debut season.

Meanwhile, Trent Alexander-Arnold faces a duel with Dani Carvajal, who is returning from a serious knee surgery. Alexander-Arnold's passing range, line-breaking balls and pinpoint crosses could redefine Madrid's right flank - but La Liga sides are tactically astute and will exploit any defensive lapses during his adaptation period.

Dean Huijsen moved from Bournemouth to Real Madrid for Â£50m in May

Replacing Toni Kroos requires more than one man. Dean Huijsen, signed from Bournemouth, has become the central figure in building from the back, with his range of passing crucial to maintaining tempo. 

Aurelien Tchouameni offers versatility, dropping between centre-backs or stepping into midfield to ensure Madrid always control space. Arda Guler, meanwhile, has been reinvented as a central midfielder. Against Tirol he was Madrid's most productive attacker, creating four chances and assisting Mbappe. For a player once used as a 10, this new role may prove transformative.

Rodrygo remained an unused substitute in Real Madrid's 4-0 loss to Paris St-Germain in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in July

Rodrygo now faces stiffer competition. Franco Mastantuono, the 18-year-old Argentine, headlines a Â£150m wave of new signings alongside Huijsen, Carreras and Alexander-Arnold. The 4-3-3 used against Tirol will help him integrate him, with comparisons already made to Lamine Yamal's role at Barcelona as they will be using the same wing. But adaptation will take time - he has talent and personality, but has hardly trained with the team.

Despite Premier League interest - including a call from Pep Guardiola last year - no formal offers have reached Madrid yet. The club value him at more than Â£85m, and while Rodrygo has not asked to leave, the future remains open - though it looks very unlikely he will move on. Manchester City have decided Savinho is not for sale, so that door has firmly shut.

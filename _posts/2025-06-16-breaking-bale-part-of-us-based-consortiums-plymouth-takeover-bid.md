It has been recently reported that Five-time Champions League winner, Gareth Bale retired in January 2023

Former Real Madrid and Wales star Gareth Bale is part of a US-based consortium's attempt to take over League One club Plymouth Argyle.

Talks with the private equity firm are said to be at an early stage.

Plymouth owner Simon Hallett said last month that a previous agreement to sell a stake in the club had fallen through.

Bale would be following the lead of former Real Madrid team-mate Luka Modric, who has become part of the group that acquired control of Swansea in November 2024.

The Croatia midfielder took on a minority stake in April this year with the stated aim of generating worldwide attention on the Welsh club.

Legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady previously became part of the new Birmingham City's ownership group, while Wrexham have generated huge amounts of revenue from publicity attached to their Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.

Plymouth were relegated to the third tier last season after an ill-fated return to the Championship.

The ambitious pre-season appointment of Wayne Rooney as manager did not work and his replacement Miron Muslic resigned at the end of the season and joined German club Schalke.

Former Manchester United midfielder and Watford boss Tom Cleverley was appointed as manager on 13 June.

It is not known what role, if any, five-time Champions League winner Bale will have at Plymouth should the planned takeover succeed.

The former Southampton and Tottenham man, 35, retired from playing in 2023.

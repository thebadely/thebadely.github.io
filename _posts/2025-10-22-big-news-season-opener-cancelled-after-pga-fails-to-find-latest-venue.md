Let's dive into the details: Hideki Matsuyama of Japan won The Sentry in 2025

The PGA Tour has cancelled its 2026 season-opening event in Hawaii after failing to find an alternative venue to host The Sentry. 

The tournament, which was to be played from 8-11 January, had to be moved from the Plantation Course at Kapalua on the Island of Maui because of drought conditions.  

However, the PGA Tour said that, "having assessed alternate venues in Hawaii and beyond" it could not play the tournament because of "logistical challenges - including shipping deadlines, tournament infrastructure and vendor support".

The first event of next year will now be the Sony Open from 15-18 January at the  Waialae Country Club in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The Sentry, which relocated from California to Maui in 1999, was the PGA Tour's season opener between 1986 and 2013 before returning to that slot in 2024, when the Tour switched back to a calendar-year schedule.

The field at the event would have featured the top 50 players from the previous year's FedExCup standings, as well as winners of PGA Tour events from the previous year.

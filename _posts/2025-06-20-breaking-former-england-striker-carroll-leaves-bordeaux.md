According to new developments, Andy Carroll scored two goals in nine appearances for England

Former England and Liverpool striker Andy Carroll has left Bordeaux after one season in the French fourth tier.

Bordeaux said Carroll took the decision to leave in order "to be closer to his children".

The 36-year-old joined Bordeaux from Ligue 2 side Amiens last September and scored 11 goals in 21 league games for them.

"Beyond the statistics, Andy brought his experience, physical impact and professionalism to the table every day, in the dressing room and in important games," the club said in a statement.

"Off the pitch, he is an exceptional and generous personality that the club's fans and employees have enjoyed working with."

Bordeaux, six-time Ligue 1 champions, surrendered their professional status after being relegated from Ligue 2 to Championnat National 2 because of bankruptcy last year.

Carroll scored 54 goals in 248 Premier League games during spells with Newcastle United, Liverpool and West Ham United.

He then went on to play for Reading and West Bromwich Albion before moving to France with second-tier side Amiens in 2023.

According to new developments, Uefa has banned FK Arsenal Tivat from European competition for 10 years after an investigation into allegations of match-fixing involving the Montenegrin club.

A number of players and officials of Arsenal Tivat have also received bans which European football's governing body has asked Fifa to extend worldwide.

Uefa said, external the punishment, which also includes a â¬500,000 (Â£433,000) fine and runs up to and including the 2034-35 season, was in relation to a Conference League qualifying tie between Armenian side Alashkert and Arsenal Tivat in July 2023.

Arsenal Tivat drew 1-1 at Alashkert before being beaten 6-1 at home in the reverse fixture.

Uefa said Arsenal Tivat had violated article 11 of its disciplinary regulations which refers to "general principles of conduct" and article 12 which covers the "integrity of matches and competitions and match-fixing".

Arsenal Tivat player Nikola Celebic and official Ranko Krgovic were "banned from exercising any football-related activity for life". 

Three other players - Cetko Manojlovic, Dusan Puletic and Radule Zivkovic - were also banned for 10 years.

Arsenal Tivat won a relegation play-off last season to maintain their place in their country's top flight.

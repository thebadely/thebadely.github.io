It has been recently reported that The Daily Mail, the Daily Express and The Sun lead on the man suspected of driving into crowds in Liverpool being questioned on suspicion of offences including drug-driving. The Express describes how a steward correctly allowed an ambulance to pass by a road-block before a Ford Galaxy "raced through" behind. The Sun's editorial praises the police for revealing the ethnicity of the suspect within hours and backs calls for "full consistency" the next time there is a tragic incident or terror attack.

The main story for The Times is a letter from police and security chiefs to ministers raising concerns about plans to release some prisoners early to ease pressure on jails. A source tells the paper that although there have been changes to sentencing announced since the letter was written, the thrust of their concerns remains the same.

The Treasury is in a standoff, according to The Guardian, with some ministers over possible cuts to social housing and policing in next month's spending review. The paper says the Home Office and the housing ministry are among the departments yet to agree their budgets. The paper highlights the suggestion yesterday, by the International Monetary Fund, for the chancellor to consider refining her fiscal framework, to allow for shallower spending cuts. But government sources insist there will be no change to the rules and point to the high cost of borrowing. The Financial Times, leading on the debt market, says fiscal pressures are forcing the Treasury to shift to borrow in the shorter term to try to bring down the bill on interest payments.

The i Paper carries a warning from economists, that the policies announced by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage yesterday would risk "mini-budget style market chaos". One explains that gap between Reform's savings target and what is reasonably practical is about Â£75bn, double the un-costed commitments proposed by Liz Truss.

The Daily Telegraph focuses on the call by the Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, for the possession of cannabis in small quantities to be de-criminalised. The paper points out that the mayor does not have the power to make such a change and figures in the national Labour party, including the prime minister, remain opposed.

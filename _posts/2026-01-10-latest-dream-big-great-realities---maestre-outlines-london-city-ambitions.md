Experts revealed that It came as something of a surprise when London City Lionesses announced they had parted company with manager Jocelyn Precheur last month.

The Frenchman had led the club to the Women's Super League 2 trophy last season, securing promotion to the top flight for the first time in their short history.

And they were sixth at the halfway point of their debut WSL campaign, with five wins from the first 11 league matches, when Precheur was sacked.

But the controversial decision was not based on results. 

Owner Michele Kang wanted a coach capable of implementing a unique style of football - one that aligns with the club's vision of playing in European competition by 2027.

So who is Eder Maestre - the man tasked with fulfilling London City's bold future ambitions?

Precheur gone - so what's next for London City?

Maestre's last job was at CD Tenerife Femenino in Spain's top-tier, where he guided them to a sixth-placed finish last season. 

He resigned from the side - based in the Canary Islands - in December, with the club fifth.

"Without a doubt, Eder Maestre was one of the most talented coaches in the Liga F, and it was expected that sooner or later he would get an opportunity like this one with London City," Spanish football journalist Marta Grinan told BBC Sport.

Maestre himself said the job was one he could not refuse.

"When I resigned at Tenerife, I was thinking of getting home, taking some rest days, but in a few days, my agent says to me that I have a lot of options to join some clubs, and one of them was London City," said the Spaniard.

"This, in my opinion now, is the best female project in football. So I cannot say no."

Maestre, who was appointed on 2 January, will take charge of his first game on Sunday when London City travel to bottom club Liverpool.

When Maestre held his first press conference on Friday, he repeatedly returned to his two core principles - ambition and humility.

"I'm here - very far from my family - because I am that ambitious," he added. 

"I want to be a piece in the new building steps, they [London City Lionesses] are trying to become a top level club in the world."

The 39-year-old's sense of purpose is rooted in how closely the club's vision mirrors his own personal values.

"One of my own phrases is 'dream big, great realities'," said Maestre.

"The club goals are very aligned to my individual values in my life, so this alignment gave me confidence to try to use this this season to keep building that foundation, to dream big in the next one."

While he is fully aware of London City's desire to stand alongside the elite of women's football, he believes progress must be rooted in humility.

"If you want to win, the first step or the first pillar is being humble, respecting the opponent that you have faced," Maestre explained.

"We cannot lose the humble vision this season, because it's going to be a very strong pillar to build and continue building the foundations.

"We want to be humble, but dreaming big, so that's the balance that we want."

Maestre describes himself as a "perfectionist" with a love of the English game.

"I am from the north of Spain, and the Basque Country is very connected to British mood," he said.

"I've loved English football since I was a child, it's my favourite league, I know a lot of the players, I grow with that energy."

While Maestre might have been inspired by English football, Grinan believes his three seasons as assistant manager to Natalia Arroyo - now Aston Villa's manager - at Real Sociedad has heavily influenced his playing style.

"He is a modern coach, a tactician and very demanding of his players and their talent. He has always advocated possession football, intelligent pressing and verticality when looking for goals," said Grinan.

"His season and a half with Tenerife was spectacular, and in Spain we are very happy that he is now one of the coaches who will take the particularities of our country's style of football, tiki-taka, to a country like England."

Regardless of his tactical approach, Maestre insists there is only one thing on his mind.

"I only think about winning games and finding the ways to win that game," he added.

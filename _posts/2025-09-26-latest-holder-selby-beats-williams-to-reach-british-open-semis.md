It has been recently reported that Mark Selby is eighth on the all-time list of ranking tournament winners with 24

Defending champion Mark Selby came from behind to win a topsy-turvy match against world number five Mark Williams and reach the British Open semi-finals.

The world number 10 edged the opening two frames before Williams turned the tables with three of his own.

But four-time world champion Selby responded with a break of 106 and took the next two frames to claim a 5-3 win.

Bidding to become the first player to successfully defend the British Open title, the 42-year-old will face world number16 Shaun Murphy in the semi-finals.

Reigning Masters champion Murphy, riding a wave of momentum after already beating world number three Neil Robertson and world number one Judd Trump, overcame Mitchell Mann 5-1 in a one-sided game.

World number 91 Mann has only previously featured once in the quarter-finals of a ranking tournament - reaching that stage of the 2021 Northern Ireland Open.

Four-time world champion John Higgins was made to sweat by world number 88 Louis Heathcote after the Englishman took the first two frames with ease.

But Higgins turned on the style thereafter, winning five straight frames - including 135 break - to win 5-2 as Heathcote scored just 39 more points.

Higgins will meet fellow Scotsman Anthony McGill in the semi-finals after he fought back from 3-1 down to win 5-3 against 19-year-old Stan Moody, who eliminated Ali Carter in the previous round.

McGill has not featured in the last four of a ranking event since the 2022 Northern Ireland Open.

Saturday's semi-finals will be the best of 11 frames (first to six), while Sunday's final will be the best of 19 (first to 10).

Each player has won Â£20,000 for reaching the semi-finals, while the runner-up will receive a further Â£45,000 and the winner Â£100,000.

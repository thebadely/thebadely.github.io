Let's dive into the details: Gervonta Davis and Jake Paul were seperated by more than 60lb in their most recent fights

Gervonta Davis and Jake Paul's exhibition bout will be contested over 10 three-minute rounds and a winner will be declared, says Most Valuable Productions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian.

The14 November bout was moved from Atlanta to Miami last week after MVP, the promotions company founded by Paul and Bidarian, pulled out of efforts to get the fight sanctioned in Georgia.

The fight is controversial because of the big weight disparity, with Davis a lightweight world champion, fighting at 9st 9lb (61kg), while Paul has fought most of his career at cruiserweight, which is 14st 4lb (90.7kg).

Speaking at the first news conference, Bidarian said the Florida Athletic Commission (FAC) had agreed to several conditions, including that the maximum weight would be 13st 13lb (88kg).

"There will be a victor because the fighters have agreed and the commission has approved a maximum weight of 195lb for this exhibition," he said.

"When Tank and Jake enter the squared circle to go to battle, they will be wearing 12oz gloves.

"Sitting ringside will be three commission-approved world-class professional judges that will score every round to ensure there's a decisive outcome for the fight if it goes the distance.

"And both men are enrolled in the highest level of testing with Usada (US Anti-Doping Agency)."

Davis wears 8oz gloves as a lightweight, while Paul often wears 10oz gloves in his fights.

Paul, 28, has 12 wins and one loss on his professional record, while 30-year-old Davis has 30 victories and one draw.

Both men hold professional licences but the result of the exhibition will not count towards their professional records.

BBC Sport has asked the FAC to confirm the details of the fight, including if knockouts will be permitted.

Paul has seven stoppages but his last two bouts have gone the distance.

"There's a lot of holes in his defence that a lot of people haven't exposed before," Paul said of Davis.

"I haven't got a knockout in a long time, so I'm itching. I'm just excited to be able to deliver that for the fans and have another most viral knockout ever."

Paul has courted criticism in the past, having fought a 58-year-old Mike Tyson last year.

Davis was expected to fight Lamont Roach Jr in a rematch after their bout in March ended in a controversial draw.

"Every time I fight, it's fireworks," Davis said.

"I'm much quicker than him. He's much stronger and much bigger, but we all know that it's harder for taller fighters to fight a shorter one.

"He's decent and he's going to hold up for a couple of round, but once it gets hot in there you know how things play out."

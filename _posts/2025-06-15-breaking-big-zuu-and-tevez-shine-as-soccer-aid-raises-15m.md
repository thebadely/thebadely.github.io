According to new developments, Big Zuu lifts the Soccer Aid 2025 trophy for the World XI

Big Zuu scored the winner as a Carlos Tevez-inspired World XI beat England in front of a sellout Old Trafford crowd for Soccer Aid.

In the 14th edition of the annual charity football match between England and a World XI - which mixes celebrities and former footballers - the World XI won 5-4, as Â£15m was raised for children's charity Unicef.

They had trailed 3-0 in the second half but turned things around thanks to four goals from former Manchester United and Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez.

All four of England's goalscorers were former England international strikers, with ex-Tottenham player Jermain Defoe getting a double after former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney and Toni Duggan - who played for clubs including Manchester City and Barcelona - had put England 2-0 up.

Among plenty of former football talents, the two sides featured the likes of former One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson, YouTuber Angry Ginge, Diamond from Gladiator, comedian Richard Gadd, Olympic gold medallist Sir Mo Farah and The Last Of Us star Bella Ramsey.

And while pop star Tomlinson was roundly cheered whenever he touched the ball, the plaudits went to England's Angry Ginge.

He was named player of the match for a defensive display which included a goal-saving clearance to deny Brazil legend Rivaldo, and some on social media jokingly called for Manchester United to sign him after their poor season in the Premier League. 

Big Zuu came on in the second half for the World XI

Rapper and TV personality Zuu had been conducting punditry duties until half-time, and predicted he would score before stepping on to the pitch.

He scored his first Soccer Aid goal with just five minutes remaining, mimicking Cristiano Ronaldo's iconic 'siuuu' celebration after beating the goalkeeper  - comedian and presenter Paddy McGuinness.

Speaking to presenter Alex Scott after the game, Zuu said: "I don't care if it's Paddy, I don't care if it's David James, I don't care if it's Joe Hart. No likey, no lighty."

Tevez moved from Manchester United to Manchester City in 2009

Tevez, 41, left Old Trafford during his playing days to join rivals Manchester City.

It prompted a bitter reaction from United fans, while City marked his arrival with a "Welcome to Manchester" poster campaign designed to annoy their rivals. 

But on his return to the city, having come on at half-time with his team 2-0 down, he scored four second-half goals to turn the match around.

The first two goals came within 97 seconds of each other, before Tevez completed his hat-trick with a well placed free-kick.

He added a fourth to level the scores before Zuu scored the winner in one of the most impressive Soccer Aid performances.

Wayne Rooney managed in the 2020 edition of Soccer Aid

Manchester United's record goalscorer Rooney is no stranger to making history at Old Trafford, and managed it again at the Stretford End.

His goal after just four minutes is the fastest in Soccer Aid history.

The former England captain was teed up by a fellow Liverpudlian, actor James Nelson-Joyce from BBC drama This City Is Ours.

Rooney was taking up a player-coach role for the England team, with fellow managers boxer Tyson Fury, ex-football boss Harry Redknapp and actor Vicky McClure.

Fury was shown by match broadcaster ITV giving a rousing team-talk before the game - though it featured swearing, prompting presenters Scott and Dermot O'Leary to apologise to viewers.

England beat the Rest of the World 2-1 in the first Soccer Aid

Soccer Aid has been raising money for United Nations children's fund Unicef since 2006, and some of the biggest names from sport and showbiz have taken part.

The idea was initiated by singer Robbie Williams and TV presenter Jonathan Wilkes, with football legends Diego Maradona and Paul Gascoigne featuring in the first edition.

Initially held every other year, the match was made annual from 2018 - with more than Â£115m raised since its inception.

To add to the donations, this year TV personality Sam Thompson ran and cycled more than 260 miles with the Soccer Aid match ball from last year's stadium, Stamford Bridge in London, to the home of this year's match, Old Trafford - raising Â£2m.

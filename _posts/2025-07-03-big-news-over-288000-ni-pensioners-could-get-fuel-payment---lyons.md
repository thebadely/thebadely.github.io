Here’s what you need to know: The Communities Minister Gordon Lyons has said 86% of pensioners in Northern Ireland will be eligible for the winter fuel payment this year.

It comes after the government performed a U-turn on its controversial policy.

Labour had initially scrapped the universal payment as a cost saving measure.

But now those with an income of £35,000 or below are eligible for the grant.

Lyons told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that his officials have assessed that the change in policy will mean 288,000 pensioners are in line for the payment.

"For comparison, across the UK as a whole about 80% of pensioners will retain [the payment], but it's slightly higher in Northern Ireland because of our lower incomes," he said. 

"This has been a mess from the start. The government have a lot to answer for on this. This has been handled horrifically by the government and has put a lot of worry and concern into the minds of our older people." 

Lyons had secured £17m from Stormont to provide a £100 one-off payment for those affected by the cut last winter.

He said the Labour government's policy was misguided.

"I said from the start this would not have saved the government a lot of money," he said. 

"What we have seen is a number of pensioners reach out for help and realise they are eligible for pension credit, which is a passport for other benefits. So in that regard it'll actually cost the government more." 

Winter fuel payments were created in 1997 to help everyone above state pension age with their winter heating bills.

The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced last year that winter 2024 would be the first time pensioners in England and Wales would not be eligible for the payment.

Northern Ireland was forced to follow suit.

Payments were then restricted to those on benefits and pension credit.

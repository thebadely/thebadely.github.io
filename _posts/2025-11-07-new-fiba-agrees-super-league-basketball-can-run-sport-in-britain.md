According to new developments, International basketball federation Fiba were founded in June 1932

Super League Basketball has reached agreement with basketball's world governing body Fiba to oversee the the sport's domestic competitions in Great Britain - lifting the ban on its men's national team.

Last month, Fiba suspended the British Basketball Federation (BBF) over governance issues and barred the men's team from international competition.

A Fiba taskforce had been set up in August to investigate "regulatory non-compliance" within British basketball.

In April, the BBF awarded a 15-year licence to run a new professional men's competition - the Great Britain Basketball League - to GBB League Ltd (GBBL).

The BBF said GBBL, a consortium led by the American businessman Marshall Glickman, would provide Â£15m funding in the first two years.

However, the existing nine SLB clubs claimed the tender process run by the governing body was "illegal and unjust" and refused to join the new league.

Fiba said in a statement it has now entered into a "direct recognition agreement" with SLB to "ensure the stability and continuity of the top-tier men's basketball in Great Britain" during the period of the BBF's suspension.

"This agreement provides a framework for the organisation and governance of domestic competitions while safeguarding regulatory integrity," said the statement.

"Fiba, through the task force, will continue to work closely with BBF and all relevant stakeholders, including UK Sport and the UK Government, to support BBF in becoming a self-sustainable organisation and to ensure the long-term stability and growth of men's basketball in Great Britain."

Fiba's decision means a ban on Britain's men's team competing on the international stage has been lifted.

Interim independent chair of SLB Sanjay Bhandari said it had been a "challenging period for the sport" but was pleased to have "reached a solution that gives our clubs the confidence they deserve".

"Fiba's recognition is transformative and means that our plans to drive SLB forward as an ambitious, high-growth sports organisation can progress at pace," he said.

"We look ahead with excitement as we work closely with FIBA, UK Sport, and the UK Government to ensure the sport achieves the success it deserves across all areas."

According to new developments, Fabio Wardley's last-ditch knockout kept him on the path to a world title shot

Fabio Wardley put himself into contention for a world heavyweight title bout following a knockout victory over Justis Huni at Ipswich's Portman Road.

The win puts Wardley in position to call out the winner of the bout between Oleksandr Usyk and Daniel Dubois, who are set to contest all four world titles next month at Wembley Stadium.

Will Wardley face Usyk or Dubois? What does the overall heavyweight picture look like at present? And will we finally get Tyson Fury v Anthony Joshua?

BBC Sports looks at the heavyweight scene.

As far as the heavyweight division is concerned, all the talk is of the rematch between Usyk and Dubois, taking place on 19 July.

Great Britain's Dubois goes into that bout with the IBF world heavyweight belt, while Ukrainian Usyk holds the WBA (Super), WBO and WBC titles.

Elsewhere, Dillian Whyte is in line for a big fight on 16 August in Riyadh. There has been talk of it being against Lawrence Okolie, but Ring Magazine reported on Saturday, external that Moses Itauma could be the opponent.

It would be a massive step up for 20-year-old Itauma, who is undefeated in 12 fights.

Anthony Joshua has a record of 28 wins and four losses from his 32 professional fights

Two-time world heavyweight champion Joshua had elbow surgery in May and has not fought since losing to Dubois at Wembley in September 2024.

Joshua is not expected to return to action until December at the earliest.

Talks are ongoing over a potential three-fight deal under the Riyadh Season banner, meaning a comeback is likely to happen in Saudi Arabia.

In April, promoter Eddie Hearn said he was confident that a fight between Joshua and Fury could still happen and talk of the highly anticipated showdown refuses to go away.

The overall landscape of the heavyweight scene largely depends on the result of Usyk v Dubois next month.

Queensberry promoter Frank Warren has confirmed that Wardley is in the picture for a title shot but said the division as a whole will become clearer after Usyk's unification fight with Dubois.

"After that fight, it will settle the heavyweight division now to know who will be the mandatories," Warren told DAZN after Wardley's win over Huni.

"[Wardley] is there. He's going to take a bit of time out now. Let the dust settle. He's in the position and he's done that through sheer grit, sheer heart."

Wardley is the number one contender in the WBA rankings and holds their interim title but it is Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev who holds the regular belt, which would usually make him next in line.

Ipswich's Wardley is likely to have to wait or put his position on the line in a non-world title fight next.

Tyson Fury has teased a return to boxing since retiring in January

As things stand, Tyson Fury remains retired. The 'Gypsy King' announced his retirement in January after losing his rematch against Usyk a month earlier.

Fury has teased on social media a potential return to the ring and is currently filming the second series of his Netflix documentary At Home With The Furys.

Team Fury have told BBC Sport that at present, there have been no talks of an imminent comeback.

His return to regular social media activity could have something to do with the documentary or Fury could be testing the waters to see if there still is an appetite for a long-awaited showdown with Joshua.

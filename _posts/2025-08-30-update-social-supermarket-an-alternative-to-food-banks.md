Experts revealed that A charity offering fresh fruit and vegetables at massively discounted prices have said their social supermarkets are a lifeline for struggling families. 

The Big Difference runs two shops in Southampton, with most of the goods  donated by commercial supermarkets and food poverty charity Fareshare. 

Chief Executive Sanjay Mall said the charity worked with more than 26 schools and  increasingly the parents they supported had been forced to go without meals themselves to feed their children. 

Unlike food banks, which often require a referral in the UK, Sanjay said the supermarket was "open to anyone who is struggling."

"People are suffering, there's a lot of hungry, starving people," said Sanjay. 

He said he set up the charity in 2020 during the pandemic to help provide relief for people struggling with food poverty and food insecurity. 

A 2024 study by the University of Southampton found that 41% of the city's residents had experienced food poverty and according to food bank charity The Trussell Trust emergency food provision is at two and a half times the level seen a decade ago. 

"We had a teacher come in and she said she was struggling," Sanjay said. "My manager offered her a food parcel for free and she burst out crying."

"Families in general, the parents aren't eating so that the kids can eat," he said. "So it's for anyone who is struggling."

The shop stocks fresh vegetables, fruit and meat, along with some toys and clothing. Anything that isn't sold is donated to a local nursery to help feed families. 

Becky Lampard began volunteering with the charity two years ago and recently began working as the manager of the shops in Northam and Shirley Warren.

"People who come in, mainly they're quite shocked that it looks like a normal shop or supermarket.  

"We've had a few people telling us their stories about how they're choosing between either paying their bills, their heating, or food," Becky said. 

She supervises around 30 volunteers who help keep the shops running.

"We wouldn't be able to run this organisation without the amazing volunteers," she said.

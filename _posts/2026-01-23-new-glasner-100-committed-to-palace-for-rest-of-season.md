Here’s what you need to know: Oliver Glasner was appointed Crystal Palace manager in February 2024

Oliver Glasner says he is "100% committed" to Crystal Palace for the remainder of his time as manager of the club.

The 51-year-old Austrian said last week he will leave Selhurst Park at the end of the season.

BBC Sport reported that Glasner was offered a new contract last summer but later informed chairman Steve Parish he would not sign the deal.

The Palace boss has been frustrated with the manner in which the club have sold key players.

Palace captain Marc Guehi was sold to Manchester City a day before the Premier League fixture at Sunderland on 17 January.

Palace also sold forward and fellow England international Eberechi Eze to Arsenal at the start of Premier League season.

Glasner said after a 2-1 defeat by Sunderland that his squad "are being abandoned completely" by the club's hierarchy, but at a news conference on Friday struck a more conciliatory tone.

"I had a very long dinner with Steve [Parish] this week and we talked about the situation not to sell Marc, again the timing and a possible replacement," said Glasner.

"I wanted to explain and it was a very good talk for both of us. I said I will give my best for a great season and Steve and me are still 100% committed."

Glasner, who guided the Eagles to their first major trophy when they beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup last season, also said he "does not regret" his comments after the Sunderland game.

"Do I think it was the best way? No I don't think so, but that's Oliver Glasner. I've always told you that's Oliver Glasner," he added.

"I don't say I'm perfect, I would like to be. I never attacked anyone personally, I just explained my feelings."

Glasner also clarified that French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta will be available for Palace's home game against Chelsea despite reports he is set to leave the club during the transfer window.

"No bid has come in and he hasn't handed in a transfer request and he will play Sunday. That's the situation," he explained.

"I'll repeat what I said two weeks ago - [for] every player there is a price where a club say OK. Evaluating the whole situation - age, contract duration and a price where the club says, 'OK we agree a deal'."

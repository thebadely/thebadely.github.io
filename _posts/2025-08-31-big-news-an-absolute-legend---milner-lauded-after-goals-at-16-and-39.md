Premier League highlights: Brighton score late winner to shock Man City

When a 16-year-old James Milner netted his first Premier League goal for Leeds against Sunderland in 2002, he probably would not have expected to be scoring another in the top flight 23 years later.

In converting from the penalty spot at the age of 39 years and 239 days in Brighton's 2-1 win against his former club Manchester City, he became the Premier League's second-oldest goalscorer, adding to the feat of being the second youngest when aged 16 years and 356 days.

Teddy Sheringham holds the oldest record at 40 years and 268 days when he scored for West Ham against Portsmouth on 26 December, 2006, while James Vaughan was aged 16 years and 270 days when he netted for Everton against Crystal Palace on 10 April, 2005.

Asked about the spot-kick that cancelled out Erling Haaland's opener and sparked Brighton's comeback success, Milner told Sky Sports "it's not the easiest thing, but my experience helped".

That highlights a standout aspect of his career and character. With 640 Premier League appearances, few can compete with his level of involvement in the top flight.

His goal ended a six-year drought, back to when he netted for Liverpool at Leicester City in 2019, yet the gap of 2075 days is only the 50th longest in the Premier League.

Milner's former City and England team-mate Joe Hart said the versatile player - who turns 40 in January and can play at full-back or midfield - "still looks fit and fresh".

Such is the longevity of Milner's career, he has now scored in the Premier League against goalkeepers born in the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s and 2000s.

"An absolute legend of the game," is how he was described by former Chelsea stopper Mark Schwarzer.

"His longevity, his fitness and he came on today and scored an excellent penalty. When you need those experienced players to step up in moments he does, he was never going to shy away from it," added the Australian on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Gruda grabs late winner as Brighton stun Man City

After injury restricted him to just four appearances last season, Milner told BBC Match of the Day he thought he may not have been able to carry on playing.

But, handed a one-year contract extension by Brighton, he was "delighted" to have come off the bench to help the club pick up their first league win.

"I thought last season might be my last [because of injury]," admitted Milner, who won three Premier League titles with Manchester City and Liverpool.

"It's nice to get it (the goal) in a victory, I'm delighted for the boys. In the first two games we didn't feel we got what we deserved. This win was a real squad effort."

Hart said Milner was "doing himself great credit" by still playing at the top level at 39.

"James Milner is awesome - what a man," added the former keeper on BBC Radio 5 Live. "I knew when the player was guarding the ball I knew Milner would take it. He is doing himself great credit.

"He is a really good footballer, he is coming up to 40 and he still looks fit and fresh."

Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler said Milner was a "very important personality and player" for the Seagulls.

"He came on and brought energy and organised it, so I am happy for him," he told BBC Match of the Day.

Hurzeler added on Sky Sports: "He spreads belief, that spreads to the others. There was pressure with the penalty but he has dealt with pressure in his past and has got highlights in his career. He has proved today he can help us."

Milner has played for Leeds, Swindon, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and Brighton during a career that has spanned more than two decades.

He dedicated his penalty strike to former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota, saying he "meant so much to everyone" and "it is an honour" to wear the same number as the Portuguese, who died with his brother Andre Silva in a car crash back in July.

Milner copied one of Jota's celebrations and said: "I didn't think I'd score too many goals this season, but that's probably the magic of his number on the shirt!"

Speaking to BBC Match of the Day, he added: "It was horrific [what happened to him]. He was a great guy and a great team-mate. I loved him as both.

"I've not scored [in the Premier League] for six years and I was wearing his number. Obviously I've got help from the great man."

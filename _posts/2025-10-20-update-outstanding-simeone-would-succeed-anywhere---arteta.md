It has been recently reported that Mikel Arteta is approaching six years in charge of Arsenal 

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says he "looks up to" Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone before their teams meet in the Champions League - and he believes the Argentine would be a success if he wanted to work in England.

Simeone has been in charge of the La Liga side since December 2011 - approaching 14 years.

That is a longer reign than any current Premier League boss.

Arteta is the second longest-serving manager working in the English top flight, having joined Arsenal in December 2019.

That puts him behind only Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, who moved to Etihad Stadium in summer 2016.

The Gunners boss was asked if Simeone's time in charge of the Spanish club was an inspiration to him.

"Well, obviously there is someone that I look up to and learn from him in many situations and what is for me outstanding is his passion," Arteta said before Tuesday's game.

"I think for how long he's been in the game and in the same club with the same players, how you still have that hand and that capacity to transmit such an energy and willingness to win.

"It's a very tough environment that we live in and to keep convincing players you have to be extraordinary as well.

"I don't know [him] personally but everything I heard about him is that he's so good at doing that. That's one of the reasons why you are able to sustain at that level."

Arteta rates Simeone's work as "outstanding" and said he would have the qualities required to be a hit in the Premier League.

"If he works in the Champions League, which is the highest competition in Europe, he can do it anywhere," the Arsenal boss said.

"You have to come here and try it and feel it, but I'm very sure that his know-how is unbelievable, and his character and willingness will take him anywhere."

The Atletico head coach has won two La Liga titles, two Europa Leagues, one Copa del Rey and two Uefa Super Cups, while also reaching two Champions League finals.

Atletico are renowned for being tough opponents and Arteta highlighted the Spanish team's defensive strength.

"First of all the willingness to win, you can sense that in every single ball, in every single yard, the way they play," Arteta said.

"So it's about how they compete and then after how they play.

"The level of organisation is really high, the level of discipline is really high, and then they have acquired a lot of talent throughout the years that are very specific for the needs and the way they want to play, and they are very good at exploiting those opportunities."

Arsenal have won their opening two games of the Champions League without conceding a goal.

Atletico were beaten 3-2 at Liverpool but responded with a 5-1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt.

According to new developments, Dayana Yastremska is chasing her first WTA title since 2019

Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska could be allergic to grass but said she loves the surface after reaching her first final on it at the Nottingham Open.

The world number 46 beat Polish sixth seed Magda Linette 6-4 6-4 in a rain-interrupted semi-final to reach Sunday's final, where she will face American McCartney Kessler, who overcame Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova 6-4 6-2.

"I really love playing on grass, even though I think I have a bit of an allergy to it," Yastremska said.

"I'm very excited, and I was proud of myself. In general everything worked pretty well. I can't wait to play in the final."

Yastremska, who has dropped just one set on her way to the final, faces the player who beat Britain's Katie Boulter in the quarter-finals as well as top seed Beatriz Haddad Maia in the first round.

You can watch the final on the BBC from 12:00 BST.

New Zealand's World Cup defence ended with a third-placed finish as they thrashed France in a dominant display at Twickenham.

Playing before England's final with Canada amid a lively atmosphere, the Black Ferns recovered from France's early try to lead 26-7 at half-time.

Teenager Braxton Sorensen-McGee crossed twice midway through the second half to finish the tournament with 11 tries and extend her lead in the tournament's try-scoring chart.

France then scored three late tries to make the scoreline more respectable, but the six-time world champions had the result wrapped up.

"I'm proud of us and the French of how much heart, passion and pride we played with today," said Black Ferns captain Ruahei Demant.

"There will be a lot more reflection, but this tournament in England - fair play to England for putting on such an incredible tournament."

New Zealand, who were hoping to win a record-matching third consecutive World Cup, had their 11-year unbeaten streak in the tournament ended by Canada in the pair's semi-final eight days ago.

Their legendary winger Portia Woodman-Wickliffe, who earlier this tournament became New Zealand's record try-scorer, was brought to tears by a standing ovation when she was replaced by Katelyn Vaha'akolo in the 57th minute.

The 34-year-old came out of retirement to play for the Black Ferns in the tournament.

As for France, their World Cup ended with a seventh consecutive third-place play-off. They were beaten 35-17 by hosts England in their semi-final in Bristol.

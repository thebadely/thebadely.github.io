According to new developments, The Chancellor Rachel Reeves' announcement that more pensioners will get winter fuel payments this year is on several front pages.

The i Paper has spoken to experts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies who say it's likely that 1.3 million pensioners on disability and housing benefits will now get the payment, in addition to those receiving pension credit, who are already eligible.

Both The Times and The Guardian have learned about a different plan - to restore winter fuel payments to all pensioners in the autumn, and then recoup the money from the wealthiest ones, the following spring, when they fill in their tax returns.

According to The Times, one option is to base the threshold on the average household disposable income - or income after tax - which at present is about £37,000.

The Guardian says some government insiders are concerned that some wealthy pensioners will die before the money is clawed back, which would lead to their bereaved families being pursued by tax officials.

Writing in the Daily Express the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, calls for all pensioners to get the payment. He argues it's a matter a fairness.

On its front page, The Daily Mirror highlights the government's announcement that around half a million more children, in England, will be eligible for free school meals from September next year.

In an article in the paper, Sir Keir Starmer says the change will, in effect, put £500 in their parents' pockets, and help children achieve at school.

The Daily Telegraph says the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has defeated an attempt by the chancellor to raid one of his key net zero schemes, in next week's spending review.

The paper says the Treasury was considering cuts to the £13.2bn warm homes plan, which aims to insulate properties across the UK, but the scheme will be largely unaffected after fraught negotiations between Miliband and Rachel Reeves.

According to the Financial Times, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, will today apologise for the chaos unleashed by Liz Truss's ill-fated mini budget in 2022.

He'll admit that the damage to the party's credibility "is not so easily undone".

The Daily Mail says the government and the Conservatives are competing with tough-sounding immigration policies.

The Home Office is drafting legislation to make it easier to deport foreign offenders and failed asylum seekers, and the bill will restrict the use of the right to private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, is promising to revive a Rwanda-style deportation scheme and withdraw Britain from any international treaties standing in the way of it, including the ECHR and the UN Refugee Convention.

A report in The Sun says Israel has threatened to block the climate change campaigner, Greta Thunberg from delivering aid to Gaza. 

She and 11 other activists set sail from Italy on Sunday carrying what they described as a symbolic amount of aid, to raise international awareness of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, but the Israeli military says it's ready for the boat's arrival.

And finally, The Times highlights a study, conducted in the Netherlands, which found that people wishing to be seen as more attractive should smile more, rather than pay for Botox.

The research found that the effect of a smile on the perceived attractiveness of people was nearly six times greater than the impact of Botox or dermal fillers.

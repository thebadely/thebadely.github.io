Will Nuno stay on as Forest boss?

Nuno Espirito Santo says he will not quit as Nottingham Forest manager, but cannot guarantee he will still be in charge by the end of the transfer window.

The 51-year-old's future was left in doubt when he revealed on Friday how his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis had "changed" and they "are not as close".

Following Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw at Crystal Palace, Nuno said he would not walk away as boss.

"It is absurd. Never," he added, having earlier said it was "nonsense" that he was trying to engineer his own exit.

However, the Portuguese did not provide guarantees he would be at Forest beyond 1 September as he revealed discussions will take place with Marinakis and Edu, the club's global head of football, over transfers.

Asked if he would be manager at the end of the summer transfer window, Nuno said: "I cannot answer that question.

"I am working, and trying to do my job the best I can. I have had good conversations [with Marinakis and Edu], to provide a good platform for the team."

'There will be resolution' - Nuno on Forest future

While Edu was present in the stands at Selhurst Park, Marinakis was not.

Much of Nuno's unhappiness stems from Forest's activity in the transfer market this summer. They have signed eight senior players and the manager was able to bring more than Â£100m of talent off the bench at Palace.

Forwards James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson and Arnaud Kalimuendo all made their debuts, while midfielder Douglas Luiz was an unused sub.

Another new arrival, Dan Ndoye - a winger signed for Â£36m from Bologna - became the first Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since Geoff Thomas in August 1998, when he set up a second-half equaliser for Callum Hudson-Odoi.

But Nuno said Forest still need a new goalkeeper and two full-backs.

"They are options," he said of his new forwards. "If one of our wingers can play full-back, great, but these guys are not full-backs."

Sources have told BBC Sport that Nuno's position is not completely safe despite last season's achievement of qualifying for Europe. The uncertainty, according to sources, has now stretched to the playing squad.

But Nuno insists the good times can return while he is in charge, and, crucially, his relationship with Marinakis can still be repaired.

"I believe so," he added. "Everyone wants the best for Forest. We want to create harmony."

While the Forest hierarchy may be divided, the fans showed at Selhurst Park they remain behind the manager.

Nuno took to the pitch at full-time and clapped and gave a thumbs-up to fans, who responded with chants of 'Nuno, Nuno, Nuno'.

Then he turned and walked away - and it remains to be seen whether it will be for the final time.

Before the game, Forest fans told the BBC of their concern for the future of the manager who had taken them to their highest Premier League position since the mid-1990s when they finished seventh last season.

Fans Lynne and Lisa, speaking to the BBC's Aaron Paul as they waited for the away players to arrive at Selhurst Park, remain hopeful Nuno will stay.

"It came out the blue on Friday, hopefully it will all get resolved," they said.

The do not blame Marinakis, though, as they added: "We like his passion. He's spending a lot of money, we can't ask for more."

The Forest performance at Palace perhaps indicated an uncertainty among the players, lacking the verve and fluency seen in their 3-1 opening-game win over Brentford.

Forest did not have a shot on target until the 57th minute, when Hudson-Odoi's shot beat Palace keeper Dean Henderson at the near post.

Sympathy for Nuno had been in short supply from the home crowd before that equaliser.

"You're getting sacked in the morning," mocked some Eagles fans.

But, referring to Palace's demotion from the Europa League to the Uefa Conference League for breaching multi-ownership rules, Forest fans responded with, "Europa League, you're having a laugh".

Forest, who took that Europa League spot on their league placing, finished much the stronger side and almost snatched victory in added time.

Striker Igor Jesus struck the post, while Hutchinson lifted a shot over the bar after an impressive late cameo.

It meant Forest missed the chance of successive wins to start a top-flight season for the first time since 1987-88 under Brian Clough, but stretched their unbeaten Premier League run against Palace to 11 games.

'This is difficult to fathom' - fans on Nuno's future

Has Marinakis always been in control of Nottingham Forest?

While Nuno may hope to find a resolution to stay, can he really expect to come out on top in a dispute with the owner and head of football?

"This is a battle that Nuno will lose," European football expert Julien Laurens told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"We all know that once you start questioning your owner, it's done. For him to come out with this unprompted, he offered it to the whole world, he knows that it is coming and that he can't win this battle.

"We also know that him and Edu don't get on. He was already there when Edu arrived at the club, and we all know when a new sporting director arrives, they like to come with their own people."

Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha said Nuno may consider resigning now that the relationship was "broken".

"Nuno's stock is so high with the fanbase, they will want to fully believe in him," he told BBC Radio 5 Live, before the manager insisted he would not leave.

"But it is also so awkward for them because they will be grateful for what the owner has done for the club in the last few years.

"With Edu coming into the club in such an important position, he will want his own people in play, because they will never really fully trust the person that is already in play? If he could pick a manager now, would he pick Nuno? No.

"That will be nagging for as long as possible, but Marinakis and Edu won't be rooting for him to fail so they can make the change.

"But the relationship is broken and I would not be surprised if Nuno walks before he is sacked."

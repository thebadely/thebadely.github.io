Experts revealed that Kevin Thelwell (left) and Patrick Stewart (right) joined chairman Andrew Cavenagh in announcing Danny Rohl as head coach

Rangers have sacked chief executive Patrick Stewart and sporting director Kevin Thelwell with immediate effect, with the Scottish Premiership club suggesting they "do not align with their vision for the next chapter".

Both had been criticised by supporters following a poor start to the season that led to Russell Martin's dismissal in October after just 17 games as head coach.

Former Manchester United chief executive Stewart only arrived at Ibrox in December, while Thelwell's appointment was announced in April, although he did not take up post until leaving Everton at the end of last season.

Rangers have since been subject of a takeover from a US-based consortium led by Andrew Cavenagh, who has appointed director Fraser Thornton as interim chief executive while replacements are found.

"We've now had six months since we became part of Rangers to assess the club's needs as well as to get to know Patrick and Kev a bit more," chairman Cavenagh said in a club statement.

"And, simply put, when we think about what we need in both a CEO and sporting director today, it's different than who we think Patrick and Kev are. 

"We want people that align with the vision for the next chapter."

Rangers were sitting eighth in the Scottish Premiership, 11 points behind leaders Heart of Midlothian, and had failed to qualify for the league phase of the Champions League when former Southampton boss Martin was axed.

They have narrowed the gap to nine domestically under new manager Danny Rohl and are up to fourth in the table, but have now lost all four Europa League games - the latest two under the German - amid criticism of their summer transfer business.

"Responsible change is measured and steady," Cavenagh said. "Our first priority has been to improve the sporting performance and that led to our decision to part ways with Russell and bring in Danny.

"Danny has now started the process of improving the on-pitch performance and that has given us the chance to focus on other parts of the club."

Stewart took over as chairman in December after 18 years at Old Trafford, rising to become United's chief executive, having spent five years previously with Uefa's Champions League commercial agency.

He was also appointed to the Scottish Professional Football League board five months ago.

Thelwell joined Rangers after three years as Everton's director of football, having previously been head of sport for Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls.

"Patrick and Kev are both skilled executives and have delivered a lot for the club in their time with it," Cavenagh said. "I am not here and will not throw dirt on either of them.

"I think very highly of them both on personal and professional levels. It's just the reality that the club needs different things today than it did six months ago. 

"We have already started the hiring process and hope to have appointments soon, but we will prioritise quality and fit over speed.

"Change like this is always painful, especially when it involves people we care about.

"But, at the same time, we're very excited about this opportunity to bring in fresh leadership to this great club."

Cavenagh added that Rohl "will continue to have all the support that he needs".

'It's eight weeks too late' - Thelwell & Stewart depart

Although Rangers supporters have been hollering for change at the top of the club pretty much all season, the move on Monday will have come as a shock.

It was only late last month when Cavenagh voiced his backing for Stewart and Thelwell. 

"They do retain my full support," he said at the time. Cavenagh accepted that mistakes had been made at the club, but there was no hint of the drama to come. "It's Patrick, it's Kevin, it's myself, it's Paraag," he said, Paraag Marathe being the Rangers vice-chairman.

Stewart and Thelwell were deeply unpopular among the Rangers support, both of them being confronted by angry supporters on recent away trips in Europe while also being the subject of mass and noisy protest at games.

Thelwell, as sporting director, has spent a relative fortune on players since the owners took over, north of Â£30m according to club sources. Many of those players - most especially the Â£8m striker Youssef Chermiti - have not performed as yet.

The recruitment has been lavish and unsuccessful and the blame for that is at Thelwell's door. 

Spending Â£8m on the unproven Chermiti from Everton is still a source of mystification. The reported Â£4m forked out for Oliver Antman and the Â£3.5m spent on Thelo Aasgaard does not look like smart business so far either.

Rangers' domestic results are improving under new head coach Rohl, but the quality of the football is still turgid.  

Cavenagh has said he is hopeful that these players will come good but did not elaborate on what has changed since he gave his backing to Stewart and Thelwell last month. Nor has he explained why he now thinks that they are not aligned with the vision of the club.

This, it is clear, is a double dismissal, not a resignation by mutual consent. It is understood that, while Cavenagh is fully aware of the views of the supporters - how could he not be? - the decision to remove Stewart and Thelwell is not based on what he saw and heard from fans.

There is no explanation on precisely why this decision has been reached, beyond vague references to alignment and Cavenagh made a point of saying that he would not throw dirt in their direction.

As it stands, there will be no further exits from Ibrox, so Thelwell's son Robbie remains as head of recruitment. Dan Purdy stays on as technical director and Nathan Fisher is being kept on as chief scout.

The process of appointing a new chief executive and a new sporting director will be led by Cavenagh and Marathe. 

At Rangers, it is a relentless churn. Another new chief executive and another sporting director/director of football are being sought. 

Stability off the field is proving just as elusive as success on it.

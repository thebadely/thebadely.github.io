Tommy Fleetwood made his son Frankie's dream come true after sealing his eighth European tour title with a two-shot victory at the DP World India Championship.

After rolling in for a seven-under-par final round of 65 to finish on 22 under at Delhi Golf Club, the Ryder Cup star said his eight-year-old son had never had a chance to run on to the 18th green to congratulate him. 

He was not present for Fleetwood's maiden PGA Tour victory in August and was not old enough to attend the world number five's last win on the DP World Tour, in January 2024.

"That was all day today what I had in my mind - could I put myself in a position where I could actually make that happen?," said Fleetwood, 34, after embracing his son on the green.

"It's just one of those little things. It means so much to me and that was really cool...that's what I wanted to do all day.

"I hope there are going to be many more times when we hopefully get the chance to do that."

Fleetwood had started the final round in second place, two shots behind Japan's Keita Nakajima.

New Zealander Daniel Hillier - ranked 218th in the world - leapfrogged them into a surprise lead, after moving to seven under for his round, but was unable to recover from a double bogey six on the 14th.

Nakajima, meanwhile, could not summon up the fireworks of his third-round 65, and had to settle for his third second-place finish on the DP World Tour.

However Englishman Fleetwood, whose putter had run cold during a frustrating third round on Saturday, had a run of four consecutive birdies around the turn - from the seventh to the 10th - followed by fine birdie putts on the 14th and 17th, to go down the last with a comfortable two-shot advantage.

His latest victory ensured he would qualify for the season-ending tournaments and continued a recent run of form that also included a star turn in Europe's Ryder Cup win over the United States in New York. 

"There's been plenty of times when things haven't gone my way, but the last two tournaments I have been in contention in I have won, so maybe things are starting to even out a little bit," added Fleetwood following the latest achievement of a remarkable season, in which he has claimed eight top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.

Fellow Englishman Alex Fitzpatrick rolled in for a birdie at the last to finish with a third consecutive round of 67, which moved him to 18 under and a tie for third place alongside Ireland's Shane Lowry.

Viktor Hovland finished his week with a flourish, moving up to 17 under and a share of fourth place after chipping in for an eagle at the last.

Rory McIlroy, meanwhile, finished in a tie for 25th on 11 under.

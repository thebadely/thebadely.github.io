According to new developments, Grace Fisk represented England's youth teams but is uncapped at senior level

Liverpool captain Grace Fisk has reduced England's already depleted defensive options for their final friendly match of the year against Ghana by injuring her calf in training. 

The 27-year-old was named in manager Sarina Wiegman's original squad for the first time having been called in to the Lionesses pool during the October window because of Katie Reid's withdrawal. 

The injury means the defender will miss out on the opportunity to win her first cap in England's game at St Mary's Stadium on Tuesday (19:00 GMT). 

"She was really enjoying it and the step up. Unfortunately she picked up this small injury so that's disappointing, mainly for her," said Wiegman.

"That's the way it is and it's good she had that opportunity to train at least. 

"That's the good thing about it - but I just hope she gets fit again really quickly and is available for Liverpool soon."

Fisk is the latest defender to be unavailable to Wiegman, who is already missing several centre-backs.

Captain Leah Williamson is recovering from the knee injury she picked up at Euro 2025, while Arsenal teenager Reid pulled out of last month's friendlies when she suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Manchester City's Alex Greenwood is also injured and Jess Carter was given a rest following Gotham FC's National Women's Soccer League Championship final victory over Washington Spirit.

It means Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier could start her fourth successive match for England, alongside either Washington Spirit's Esme Morgan or Arsenal's Lotte Wubben-Moy.

All three players featured in the 8-0 friendly win over China on Saturday.

England have played nations from four different continents in their final two international windows of the year, with one eye on the 2027 Women's World Cup.

Wiegman's side will begin their qualification process next year and while they have been celebrating their Euros win as part of the four-game 'homecoming' series, it has also been a chance to face different opposition. 

England have not previously faced Ghana and there are 63 places between the nations in Fifa's world rankings. 

The Lionesses are resounding favourites, having seen off China with ease on Saturday - and Wiegman hopes Ghana will provide a real test.

"That's what we want of course. We talk a lot about when we play the African countries and of course they have their different styles of play, and different tweaks in how they want to play, but you often see a lot of speed and physicality," Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"Ghana also have a clear structure of how they want to play. In moments they want to play a possession game but they also want to be direct. 

"That is what we want to force them to do - not to give them time to play. It's good to have that challenge because we want that going into the next stage."

Wiegman also hopes the match, which will be played in front of a 24,000 crowd at St Mary's Stadium in Southampton, will attract interest in Africa and help bring more exposure to the women's game.

"As we say all the time, the women's game is growing and here it grows really fast. In England we are a kind of trailblazer with everything growing so fast," she added. 

"I think this is also an opportunity for them. We play each other and I hope we get a lot of attention in Africa and of course in Ghana specifically. 

"I think it's growing [in Africa] too - and it can't go fast enough for me."

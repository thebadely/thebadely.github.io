Here’s what you need to know: Will the start of 2026 see a change of fortune for BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton, whose title hopes are fading fast?

After Sutton made a strong start to the season, AI has taken charge of the predictions title race, clinching another win last week.

"It's been a bad start to the new year for me, with AI top of the table," Sutton said.

"I also lost to my daugher Sophia at cards over Christmas. We played rummy and I think she was cheating - a lot like AI, she was definitely getting some help from somewhere."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 20, he takes on singer-songwriter Andrew Cushin, who is a Newcastle fan.

Cushin's second album, Love Is For Everyone, was released last year and reached the top 40. He has toured arenas in Europe and the United States with Louis Tomlinson and also played a sold-out hometown gig at Newcastle's City Hall in October 2025.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Cushin has been championed by Pete Doherty and Noel Gallagher, who produced and played guitar on his track 'Where's My Family Gone'

Alan Shearer was one of Cushin's first heroes, but his idol as a kid was a Toon player who stopped goals, rather than scored them.

"I first went to St James' when I was very young, but my first proper memory was against Stoke in 2008," he explained. "We were 2-0 up at half-time, and I remember being on the concourse at half-time and thinking how great it was to be a Newcastle supporter.

"That didn't last long - we ended up throwing the game away, conceding a couple of late goals and drawing 2-2 - but it was watching Shay Given pull off some big saves that day which made me want to be a keeper.

"Everyone else looked the same, wearing the same shirts, and it was just that one player, the goalkeeper, standing out. You are the last line of defence and you can be the hero, and I always liked that gamble - if it went wrong it was my fault, or I could be the reason why we get the points.

"I was quite keen on that, and then I suppose that transitioned into me being a musician, where it is my name on the poster. I guess I've always liked the attention!"

Cushin's career between the sticks saw him play in the youth team for non-league Newcastle Benfield, but he has had to hang up his gloves to focus on playing the guitar.

"It was a sad day when I had to stop playing, but it came after I'd spent some time in the studio with Noel Gallagher, and I realised I couldn't afford to carry on as a keeper and risk breaking my fingers," he added.

"So I always say it was Shay who inspired me to put the gloves on, and Noel who told me to take them off again!"

Chris Sutton and Andrew Cushin were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Villa Park, 12:30 GMT

Nottingham Forest did not have a very good Christmas, losing three games in a row.

Sean Dyche's side had plenty of possession against Everton on Tuesday but did not create many chances, and were picked off. That was a bit of a surprise, because of the Toffees' lack of firepower.

Forest are lucky West Ham have been so bad, because that is the only reason they still have a bit of breathing space above the bottom three.

They travel to play the Hammers on Tuesday, so they may prioritise that game and rest players here - it is that time of year where every squad is stretched.

This game is more about how Aston Villa respond to their defeat at Arsenal, because they took a bit of a pasting.

I don't think this will be easy for Villa, but I am expecting them to bounce back and win a tight game.

I've seen that AI goes for a 2-1 scoreline most of the time and I won't be doing that for every game this week, but I do think that's how this one will end up.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Andrew's prediction: I don't think Villa will fall away after losing to Arsenal. It's sad to see the demise of Forest, who have not been the same side this season, and I can see Villa steamrollering them here. 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Amex Stadium, 15:00

I keep backing Brighton to win and keep a clean sheet, which is part of the reason my predictions have been going so badly - they are on a six-game winless run.

Burnley's wait for a victory has gone on a lot longer, and they have taken only two points from their past 10 games.

I keep saying the Clarets have been competitive, but that is not going to keep them up. Their points tally is what matters, and that means they are bang in trouble.

Despite their poor run, I still see the Seagulls as being able to cause anyone problems.

They pushed Arsenal close last week and I always think they have a goal in them but, more importantly in terms of how this game might go, they are usually pretty reliable at home.

Villa are the only team to have won at the Amex Stadium this season, and I don't see Scott Parker's side getting anything at all on the south coast.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Andrew's prediction: Burnley gave us a good game the other night and this will be close too, but Brighton will have a little bit too much for them. I love Brighton's Yankuba Minteh - he's a brilliant player, and I wish we had never let him leave. 1-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Molineux, 15:00

Wolves' performance in their draw with Manchester United underlined what I already thought.

Yes, they have lost a couple of key players in Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri, but they have still got enough in their squad to have done far better than they have done this season.

This is a massive week for West Ham, with their relegation rivals Nottingham Forest up next after this game.

The Hammers are looking pretty desperate but their recent away record actually is not too bad - they were well beaten at Manchester City but, before then, they drew three in a row at Bournemouth, Manchester United and Brighton.

They probably feel under less pressure when they are on the road, but I am still reluctant to back them to win anywhere at the moment.

I feel the same way about Wolves, who have now gone half the season without a victory. Let's call this one a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Andrew's prediction: Wolves surely can't go the whole season without winning a game - a win has got to come from somewhere. With West Ham struggling too, Wolves will probably fancy this a bit, but it's a must-win game for the Hammers too. 0-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Vitality Stadium, 17:30

I covered Bournemouth's 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday, and the Cherries really impressed me.

Andoni Iraola's side have gone 10 games without a win, but they have drawn four of their past five matches and they carried a real threat against the Blues.

Their goals came from a couple of long throws but they did look dangerous in open play and, with the way Iraola plays, this is not going to be easy for Arsenal.

Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will know that already after Bournemouth did the double over his side last season, but he and his players must be full of confidence after the way they despatched Villa last time out.

To beat Villa was a huge result and to produce that performance to go with it was Arsenal really flexing their muscles.

It said to everyone 'we are the team to beat' and you have to think they will back it up by beating Bournemouth as well.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Andrew's prediction: Arsenal ended 2025 really well with that win over Villa and the pressure is off them a little bit after City dropped points against Sunderland.

I actually think it's more dangerous for them that they have got a bit of breathing space now, rather than thinking they have to win every week, because that is when mistakes could happen - but, the form Bournemouth are in, I can't see them stopping Arsenal. 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-3

Elland Road, 12:30

I am loving Daniel Farke's Leeds United more and more, every passing week. They showed incredible guts to go to Anfield on Thursday and get a point, and they almost took all three.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin will start this game after being rested until the last 20 minutes against Liverpool, and he can cause Manchester United all sorts of problems.

Seeing Calvert-Lewin start among the substitutes raised a few eyebrows because of the run of scoring he is on, but that is the difficulty managers have at this time of year, when games come thick and fast.

I know I go against Manchester United a lot with my predictions, but I am still waiting for them to prove me wrong.

They have done all right recently, but nothing more. They have only lost two of their past 13 games, which is decent, but they have drawn five times in that run and, when I watch them, they are just not very exciting.

In fact, they are dull. Their fans used to sing 'glory glory Man United' but now they are more likely to sing 'boring boring Man United', when I expected a bit more from them this season.

You certainly wouldn't accuse Leeds United of being boring at the moment.

Maybe the way they will come at Manchester United will suit the visitors, but Ruben Amorim's side seem to lack leadership when Bruno Fernandes is missing, and I am going to back Leeds United instead.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Andrew's prediction: I am going to go for a bit of an upset here. There is obviously a big rivalry between the two teams so Elland Road will be bouncing, and Leeds have been really good recently. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-2

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00

Everton have had a great season so far. Beating Forest was an important result for them, because the six teams immediately above them all dropped points.

They are now in eighth place and, with another home league game against Wolves to come after this one, their fans must be thinking this week is a real opportunity to climb higher.

It won't be easy against Brentford, however. Keith Andrews' side took seven points out of a possible nine over Christmas, and are also in the top half of the table.

I actually think the Bees are a better team when Jordan Henderson isn't playing - Andrews left him out of their wins over Bournemouth and Wolves and they seem to have a bit more energy without him in the team.

Whether Henderson plays or not, I just can't see a lot of goals here - one will probably be enough to win it.

Brentford are very effective on the counter-attack and are certainly capable of getting a result, but I am going to back Everton to edge it.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Andrew's prediction: This is your 1-1 draw of the week, isn't it? I was talking about these games with my mates and with this one they are eighth and ninth in the table, only a point apart. There will be very little to separate them on the pitch, either. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Craven Cottage, 15:00

Fulham did really well over Christmas, especially when you consider they have lost key players to the African Cup of Nations.

Liverpool must be massively disappointed with their display and result against Leeds, after the upturn in their performances in the past couple of weeks.

Like a lot of teams, Arne Slot's side are maybe short of energy at such a busy time of year, and are lacking the spark they need.

They lost here last season, and Fulham will fancy a repeat result. I'm not sure about that, but I do think Marco Silva's side will get something from the game.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Andrew's prediction: This should be a great game. Fulham are in good form and they will have a real go at Liverpool. 2-2

AI's prediction: 0-2

St James' Park, 15:00

Crystal Palace are another team I've been wrong about a lot recently - they are on a dismal run, with only one point from their past four games.

I should have thought about it more when I was making my predictions because they are badly missing the firepower of Ismaila Sarr, who is away at Afcon with Senegal.

Brennan Johnson will add some fresh legs to the Eagles attack, but I actually think Newcastle will run away with this one.

I always fancy Newcastle at home to score and also to run over teams, but this season they have sometimes struggled to put games to bed.

I am backing them to do all of the above this time, however. Eddie Howe's side smashed Palace 5-0 last season, and this should be another convincing win.

Sutton's prediction: 3-0

Andrew's prediction: Palace are a tricky team, but with it being at St James' Park I don't see us getting turned over there. We've been decent at home but then we have also thrown away a lot of points from winning positions, so I am hoping we see it out this time.

Joelinton being back could make the difference there because he is such a presence in midfield - I said it a few weeks ago when he got injured that I thought we'd lost our nastiness when he wasn't in the team. We need a run of results in 2026 to get up the table so hopefully that starts here. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00

I'm not sure if Sunderland will have anything left in the tank after their efforts against Manchester City on Thursday.

It was another example of why they have done so well - they defended brilliantly, but they were dangerous when they got the ball and they could have beaten City too.

Mind you, Tottenham are so drab at the moment that it probably won't matter too much if the Black Cats are low on energy.

Sunderland are always so well organised at the back, while I don't think Spurs, in an attacking sense, have really clicked this season.

Tottenham will be exhausted as well, so I don't see many goals in this one - in fact, I don't see any at all.

A goalless draw is unlikely to cheer the Spurs supporters up much, either.

I know they love getting angry, but they are a fanbase who don't actually seem to know what they want - is it a manager who delivers attractive attacking football, or someone who can set up a team to keep a clean sheet every week?

Sutton's prediction: 0-0

Andrew's prediction: I thought there would be a drop-off from Sunderland when they lost so many players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but that hasn't happened - they put in a great performance against City. I don't think they get a win here, but I don't think they lose either - they have got a habit of not getting beaten this season, which is frustrating!

Tottenham were really flat against Brentford so they might respond a bit here, but I still see this ending up as another draw. 1-1

AI's prediction: 3-1

Etihad Stadium, 17:30

Chelsea were really not that bad under Enzo Maresca - fifth in the Premier League, into the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and still well placed in the Champions League.

His departure was clearly down to a breakdown of his relationship with the club's hierarchy, rather than results.

Maresca did not feel he had the control he wanted, and I get why he was unhappy. As Pat Nevin said on BBC Radio 5 Live, maybe Chelsea need a puppet as their next manager, who will do as he is told.

I really liked Maresca. I know some Chelsea fans found his style of play last season boring, and a bit predictable, but they ended up in the top four last year and of course they became world champions as well.

Their performances in the big games this season have been pretty good, too, but this time, as well as being without Maresca, they are also missing Moises Caicedo - who is suspended after his booking against Bournemouth. He will be a big, big loss.

Chelsea have got enough other talent to still go and get a result at Etihad Stadium, but I don't think they will.

I am expecting City to find their shooting boots again after they were shut out by Sunderland, especially if they can find a long throw.

Chelsea could not deal with Antoine Semenyo's deliveries when they played Bournemouth on Tuesday.

A lot has been made of how young Chelsea's defence is, but that's not actually the case.

When you look through their team, they are not inexperienced. They will need to do far better against a City side that could be too sharp and streetwise for them, but their age is not an excuse.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Andrew's prediction: City will want to put things right after being held by Sunderland. They might have to be patient here, and I can see it being 1-1 after half an hour... but they will win in the end. 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

There were a few surprise results in week 19, which took in the final games of 2025 on Tuesday, 30 December and the first matches of 2026 on New Year's Day.

Chris and his guest, singer-songwriter and Sunderland fan Tom A Smith, both got three correct results with no exact scores for a total of 30 points - although Smith was right about one of the 'shocks' when he backed the Black Cats to hold Manchester City.

The BBC readers only managed two correct results but they did get one exact score - Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw with Fulham - giving them 50 points.

It was AI who took the weekly win thanks to four correct results and two exact scores, which saw it end up with 100 points.

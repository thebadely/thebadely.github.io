Let's dive into the details: Caitlin Beevers was part of the England squad that reached the semi-finals of the most recent World Cup staged in 2022

England international Caitlin Beevers returned to action for Leeds Rhinos after more than a year out injured in Sunday's Women's Super League win over Huddersfield.

Leeds captain Beevers, 23, is fit again after a serious knee injury and crossed for one of the Rhinos' five tries in a 28-4 success.

Despite their victory, Leeds are now certain to finish fourth after third-placed York beat Barrow 48-6 in their penultimate game of the regular season.

Agnes Wood and Izzy Bibby scored two tries apiece for defending champions York, who crossed nine times in all.

Warrington Wolves were scheduled to host Leigh Leopards on Sunday but that match was postponed following Warrington's withdrawal from the league on Friday.

As a result, Leigh were awarded a 48-0 victory.

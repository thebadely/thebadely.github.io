Let's dive into the details: A father has told how he used his car to hit a man suspected of stabbing 10 people on a train.

Dave Scott, 57, was waiting to collect his daughter at Huntingdon railway station in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening when a man holding a knife tried to get in his car.

He said: "It was a case of fight or flight, and I just powered away as quick as I could, also taking him with [me]."

Soon after Mr Scott's intervention, police officers arrested the man, British Transport Police confirmed. Anthony Williams, 32, has been charged with attempting to murder 10 people on board a train.

Passengers on the 18:25 GMT Doncaster to London King's Cross LNER service were attacked shortly after the train left Peterborough.

It was diverted to Huntingdon - an unscheduled stop - where Mr Scott was waiting  in the car park.

He said he saw people running along the platform, which he initially thought was "just a bunch of teenagers who'd been pratting around".

He then witnessed more people fleeing the station before seeing "a large male". 

"He was under the light at the time so it sort of shadowed him out and he was just heading straight for me. At that point I could see he had a knife in his hand," said Mr Scott.

"He came straight to my car and, if I remember rightly, he tried the door, couldn't get in and he started chopping down on the top of my car."

Mr Scott drove off and spun his BMW around "thinking that if I can I was probably going to hit him again if he was up or not, but at that point the police just appeared from everywhere".

He said he was yards away from where police made the arrest, and he left his car in position lighting up the area so officers could see better.

After the arrest Mr Scott, from nearby St Ives, said the "adrenaline was still pumping", and when he phoned his daughter Helena, it was a "massive relief" to learn she was not on that train.

Her train had been stopped elsewhere in Cambridgeshire and they made alternative arrangements to get her home.

On Tuesday, British Transport Police, which is leading the investigation, said rail worker Samir Zitouni was still "critically unwell" in hospital.

Rail operator LNER has described his actions as "nothing short of heroic", after he reportedly protected a girl from being stabbed. Three other people remain in hospital.

Mr Williams, of no fixed abode, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday and was remanded until the next court date on 1 December.

As well as being charged in relation to Saturday's incident, he is also accused of carrying out a knife attack earlier in the day on another train in east London.

Cambridgeshire Police is also reviewing three other knife-related incidents being investigated for possible links to Mr Williams, including an alleged attack on a 14-year-old boy.

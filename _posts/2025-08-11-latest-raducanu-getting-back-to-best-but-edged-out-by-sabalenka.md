Experts revealed that Emma Raducanu has climbed back into the world's top 40 this season

Britain's Emma Raducanu fell agonisingly short of beating world number one Aryna Sabalenka and earning a statement win at the Cincinnati Open.

Raducanu, 22, lost 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) as defending champion Sabalenka edged a battle lasting more than three hours to reach the fourth round.

Having also pushed Sabalenka at Wimbledon, Raducanu's performance was further evidence she can severely test the world's best as her revival continues.

This season, with the British number one's fitness issues largely behind her and the development of greater resilience, she has climbed back into the top 40.

"As I said at Wimbledon I am really happy to see her healthy - mentally and physically," said Sabalenka.

"Every time she is improving and I can see she is getting back to her best.

"I'm enjoying fighting against her - she is such an incredible player."

Raducanu could be seeded among the leading 32 players at the upcoming US Open, providing a more favourable draw - in theory at least - at the hard-court Grand Slam which she won as a teenage qualifier in 2021.

On the basis of this display against Sabalenka, there are plenty of positives for Raducanu to take into the final major of the season.

Relive Raducanu's narrow defeat by Sabalenka at Cincinnati Open

With her service game providing a strong foundation, backed by calmness and clarity from the baseline, a tense contest in a sweltering Cincinnati could easily have gone her way.

Sabalenka was well below her best level throughout, with the powerful baseline game which has delivered three major titles looking vulnerable and erratic.

Raducanu, who was guided vocally throughout by her new coach Francisco Roig, took full advantage.

Roig was part of the team which helped Rafael Nadal win the bulk of his 22 major titles, and his forensic attention to detail was clear throughout the match.

Regular instructions came about the pattern of Raducanu's serve and the shape of her forehand, while she also responded well when he implemented some positive reinforcement.

"You're better than her," was one of the 57-year-old Spaniard's messages to the player.

In the past Raducanu has wilted in similarly intense battles and equally draining conditions.

Temperatures hit 32C during the match, with the humidity also high in Ohio

The manner in which she survived four break points during a marathon eighth game in the decider - coming through 12 deuces to hold serve after 22 minutes - was a fine example of her improved durability in recent months.

Sabalenka, though, has a formidable record in tie-breaks. She showed why by holding her nerve and being brave in the match-defining moments, meaning she has now won her past 16 tie-breaks - an Open era record in WTA singles.

That enabled the 27-year-old Belarusian to prevail despite winning three fewer points than Raducanu over the course of the match.

Despite the clear positives, Raducanu's defeat means she has still only won three of her 17 matches against top-10 players and never beaten an opponent ranked in the world's top four.

She will be hoping that will change sooner rather than later - perhaps in New York.

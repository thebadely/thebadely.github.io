According to new developments, The Royal Family is hoping "nothing will detract or distract" from VE Day commemorations this week, which fall days after Prince Harry's interview. 

The King and Queen are looking forward to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe and the end to World War Two, Buckingham Palace said.

Events begin on Monday with a military procession through central London after which members of the Royal Family will appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony.

On Friday the Duke of Sussex spoke candidly with the BBC about his estrangement from his father and desire for reconciliation, after losing a court battle over his UK security.

It is understood that, out of respect for surviving veterans, Buckingham Palace hopes "nothing will detract or distract from celebrating with full cheer and proud hearts that precious victory and those brave souls, on this most special and poignant of anniversaries".

King Charles and Queen Camilla will lead the nation in "celebrating, commemorating and giving thanks to the wartime generation whose selfless devotion, duty and service should stand as an enduring example to us all - and must never be forgotten", a Palace aide said.

This year's VE Day commemorations are the first to take place without any of the royals who were present 80 years ago.

In 1945, large crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace to catch a glimpse of King George VI, the Queen Mother, a young Queen Elizabeth II, and Princess Margaret.

Those present on the balcony this year will watch the traditional Red Arrows flyover.

Later in the afternoon, the Royals will also host a tea party for war veterans, their families and other members of the wartime generation in the palace gardens.

Then, on 8 May, the King, Queen and other royals will attend a thanksgiving service with veterans at Westminster Abbey before the royal couple attends Horse Guards Parade for a celebratory concert.

None of the Royal Family has publicly commented on the interview from Prince Harry.

On Friday, he revealed that his father refuses to speak to him and, given King Charles's cancer diagnosis, he does not know how much longer the King has left.

The comments came after the duke lost a legal challenge against the British government over his security while in the UK - a decision which he says has left him vulnerable to threats on his life and would prevent his return.

Buckingham Palace responded to the interview - which included the prince's claim that his court defeat was an "establishment stitch-up" - by saying the issues had been repeatedly examined by the courts which had reached the same conclusion each time.

The Home Office, meanwhile, said it was "pleased" the judgement was in the government's favour, adding the UK's security system is "rigorous and proportionate".

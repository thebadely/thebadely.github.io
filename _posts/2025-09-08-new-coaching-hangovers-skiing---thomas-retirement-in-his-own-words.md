It has been recently reported that Geraint Thomas has represented Ineos Grenadiers since the team's inception - then as Team Sky - in 2010

Geraint Thomas is feeling fragile. It's the morning after the night before, when the former Tour de France champion brought the curtain down on his glittering career.

After Sunday's final stage of the Tour of Britain, Thomas was greeted by thousands at a special ceremony at Cardiff Castle, before heading off for a party with family and friends.

Usually, the 39-year-old would be thinking about how best to recover from his hangover in preparation for his next training ride or race.

But having crossed the finish line for the final time, at the end of a career that spanned three decades, Thomas needn't worry about racing anymore.

The double Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion invited BBC Sport Wales to his home to reflect on Sunday's farewell and look ahead to what the future holds.

BBC Sport Wales: How were last night's celebrations?

Geraint Thomas: "It was good. I struggled to get up this morning. I didn't even hear you come in, actually, and then my father-in-law woke me up and said: 'They're all downstairs waiting for you.' I was like, 'Oh, man'. I don't really remember that much towards the end of the night, but it was great - the bits I do remember.

"The castle, everyone there was just amazing. The finish with the crowd at the podium and then we went into town with just the team and friends and family, and it was really good. I'm just suffering now, but it was all worth it."

Reflecting on Sunday, we don't often see you emotional. It was such a great turnout. How was your final race?

"It was just amazing to finish in Cardiff. I'm so lucky the Tour of Britain is when it is, this time of year at the end of the season, so we could finish here. The organisers making the finish in Cardiff was the stuff of dreams. It was unreal riding through Birchgrove, where I grew up, by my mum and dad's house, past Maindy (Thomas' first cycling club), there's no better way to finish."

This is the first day of a new chapter in your life. Is this something you prepared for?

"Not really. I have an idea of what I'm going to do professionally, stay with the team [Ineos Grenadiers] more than likely. I feel like I've got a lot of experience to offer there.

"But then there's a whole other side of not having to ride a bike anymore but still wanting to be active and maybe trying some different sports. I've bigged myself up about doing an Ironman, but now I'm starting to regret that! I'd still love to do one. I wouldn't be taking it too seriously.

"I've booked a skiing holiday for January, which is something I've never done before. I'm doing everything I've put off for the last 20 years."

You mentioned a role with the team. What kind of role do you envisage?

"I spoke to Dave [Brailsford] about it quite a lot, and a lot of it is sitting back and taking it all in. As an athlete, I know a lot about preparing for racing and doing my thing, but the team on the whole is a whole organisation.

"So just figuring out how that all works, but the main thing would be working with riders, their goals and how you prepare for it, getting race programmes and the training and everything and then going to races and executing those plans. So that's exciting.

"That's something I've done for the last 20 years and now it's sort of doing it on a bigger scale. That's the general idea. Nothing's confirmed yet but I feel like doing something that would excite me.

"Working with guys like Filippo Ganna who's got a great chance of winning some big one-day races like Paris-Roubaix, Milan-San Remo. Then you've got the younger guys coming through, like Josh Tarling, who's only 21, so just helping guys like that and sharing my knowledge and experience."

What will you miss the most?

"I think the camaraderie in the team, when you're all in it together out on the road and afterwards as well, when you debrief and you're talking about what happened. It sounds a bit corny but it's sort of like a band of brothers type of feel to it. I'll definitely miss that.

"But then there's a hell of a lot that I won't miss. Obviously, the training, the time away and stuff - but it was definitely a lot more good than bad. It's definitely the right time to call it a day."

Speaking to your parents last night, they said they were relieved you'd finished in one piece. After all the crashes and injuries, is it a relief to come to the end?

"Calling time on your career on your own terms is rare, so that's what I'm most relieved about. When it comes to crashes and stuff, you don't really think about it as an athlete. I know a few rugby boys and they don't think about getting injured, but everyone that cares about them does. It's the same thing for me.

"Sa [Thomas' wife Sara] struggles to watch it. She was watching from the studio one day and that's when I hit a telegraph pole and disappeared off a cliff. From that day, she didn't really watch anymore. My mum, I don't think she's watched me race since I've been 18. So yeah, they're definitely relieved that I've stopped, and in one piece.

"But for me, I've never really thought about it because otherwise I wouldn't be able to do it. It's almost like you just take that pin out and you just go."

What are you looking forward to most in the next chapter of your life?

"Definitely being around more with my family, doing some different sports, moving back to Cardiff as well in a year or so. It's a big change - I've lived on the Cote d'Azur for 13 years. It's going to take a bit of adjusting to the weather and everything.

"But it just feels right for all of us - for Sa, for me, for Macs [Thomas' son] to come home, to be around family more. We're sending Macs to a Welsh school so I'm definitely going to learn some Welsh. I can't have him speaking to Sa behind my back!

"It's a new chapter and I'm looking forward to new things now."

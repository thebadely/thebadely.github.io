City held by Monaco after late Dier penalty

Pep Guardiola was asked by BBC Sport on Friday whether he was becoming concerned about the late goals conceded by his Manchester City side.

"I have many concerns," he replied. "But not this one."

Guardiola may well be re-assessing that answer now.

City twice let slip a lead on Wednesday night in the Champions League, being pegged back to a 2-2 draw in Monaco, with the second equaliser arriving in the 90th minute courtesy of England defender Eric Dier's cool penalty.

Goal machine Erling Haaland continued his scintillating scoring form by scoring both of City's goals, but was scathing in his assessment of the performance.

"Of course I don't feel good we didn't win," the Norwegian told TNT Sport. "We do something unnecessarily in the second half and we don't think we played good enough. We don't deserve to win.

"We need more energy. We need to get at them more as we did in the first half and dominated much more. In the second half they took the lead much more and I don't think it is good enough.

"Every Champions League game is tough, look at last year when we went out. There are not many teams who have won their first two games."

Ask about Man City - what do you want to know?

City were on their way to making it back-to-back wins in the Champions League this season but Dier's nerveless, last-minute penalty salvaged a draw for Monaco.

Guardiola's side are unbeaten in their last six games, but a worrying trend is beginning to emerge of conceding late goals.

They have conceded eight times in all competitions so far, but half of those have come at crucial periods in each half.

23 August: 2-0 home loss against Tottenham after conceding in the third minute of injury-time in the first half

31 August: 2-1 loss at Brighton after conceding in the 89th minute

21 September: 1-1 draw at Arsenal after conceding in the 93rd minute

1 October: 2-2 draw at Monaco after conceding in the 90th minute

It means City have dropped three points in the Premier League after conceding in the 89th minute or later - which would have seen them on level points with second-placed Arsenal - and a further two in the Champions League.

This was also a missed opportunity to put right their recent poor away record in Europe, now failing to win their past five games on the road in the competition.

The result follows on from last season's disappointment of not winning a major trophy, being knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off round and finishing third in the Premier League.

"You wouldn't panic," former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt said on Match of the Day. "Everyone wants to win their games and get the adulation of what a great team you are but it is not normal to keep doing it year on year.

"Man City have done it for so many years but they are having a bit of a struggle over the last couple of years. They have players who can turn games and win you big competitions and trophies.

"They will be there or thereabouts, they just have to get the squad together and be fit coming in to the new year."

Butt discusses 'stupid' Man City defending for late Monaco penalty

Time was running out when Dier stooped to nod a free-kick towards goal, but was instead kicked in the head by City substitute Nico Gonzalez.

The former Tottenham man did incredibly well to score from the spot after being made to wait over five minutes to take the kick because of a combination of the referee reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor and a disagreement between the two sets of staff.

Guardiola felt Gonzalez "touches the ball first" and had "no intention" of fouling Dier, while Haaland concluded that he had not seen the incident again "but if you kick someone in the face, I guess it is a penalty".

Butt added: "It is a bit lazy from the defenders. Dier made a strong, aggressive run from deep and the defenders let him bully them.

"There was not much contact but a really stupid thing to do in the box in such a big game in the last minute. There was no doubt they were going to give a penalty. You just have to see the picture for one second on the screen and it is a penalty in European football."

Former City defender Nedum Onuoha said it was "good to see an Englishman scoring penalties" in a World Cup year.

It did not make pleasant viewing for City though.

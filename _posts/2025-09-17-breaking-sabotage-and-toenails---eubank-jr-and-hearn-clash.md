According to new developments, Chris Eubank Jr beat Conor Benn on all three of the judges' scorecards in their fight in April

Chris Eubank Jr's grievances against Conor Benn and his team caused a news conference promoting their rematch to descend into relentless arguing.

Eubank, 35, used the opportunity to claim Team Benn and Eddie Hearn tried to "sabotage" him before his first fight with Benn in April.

Among several accusations, Eubank claimed Team Benn meddled in his weight cut, branding them "ruthless" and "without restraint".

"They did everything they could to try and destroy me in this last fight. Contract breaches, fines, rehydration clauses, sabotage weigh-in, biased commentary and refereeing," Eubank began before Hearn batted away the claims as false.

The Wednesday media event was the first time Eubank and Benn have seen each other since their first bout.

Eubank was admitted to hospital after the win and said he lost a toenail to "severe dehydration".

"I've never heard so much waffle," Hearn replied. "You are playing the victim."

The British rivals will fight again in November, with Benn seeking revenge after a points loss.

The rematch is attempting to recapture the magic of the first fight, when the sons of boxing legends Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn faced off in front of 60,000 people at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Eubank Jr and Hearn clashed repeatedly during the build-up to the first fight, with the former taking to heckling the Matchroom promoter whenever he spoke.

The bad blood has seemingly spilled over, with Eubank Jr accusing Conor Benn of going on a "victory tour" despite losing.

"I'm telling you right here and now, you ain't no champion and you most definitely ain't no people's champion," Eubank said.

"These men aren't not men of the people. They are pretending. They're pretending to be the good guys. Wolves in sheep's clothing."

Benn did not rise to the bait of Eubank, letting his promoter do most of the talking.

But the 28-year-old promised to be less "greedy" in the rematch.

"It felt like I was one punch away from winning, but I was always looking for the one punch," he said.

After a news conference full of squabbling, the face-off passed without major incident.

Eubank smirked at Benn, but after the egg-slap incident earlier this year, there was plenty of security nearby to keep things cordial.

Benn wore a Manchester City shirt in tribute to Ricky Hatton

Before the arguments began, there was a poignant tribute to two-weight world champion Hatton.

Hatton passed away on Sunday, aged just 46.

Benn wore a Manchester City retro top to honour the Manchester fighter and there was a long tribute to Hatton at the beginning of the news conference.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live before the event, Benn said Hatton was his "hero".

"I can't really process it," he said.

"He was somebody who really helped me in my career but also somebody who took me in. Like a father figure would.

"He made me feel at home when I didn't have a home. He meant a lot to me. Very close to me and my family."

"He was somebody I admired as a man, he was my hero," Benn added.

"He is my hero. It's still hard to process now. I have no words. My love to the family."

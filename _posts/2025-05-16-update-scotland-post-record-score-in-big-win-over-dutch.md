Scorecard

Scotland struck their highest one-day international total in a dominant 145-run victory over the Netherlands in Utrecht.

Magnificent hundreds from Brandon McMullen (101) and captain Richie Berrington (105), after a quickfire 80 from opener George Munsey, propelled Scotland to 380-9 from their 50 overs.

The superb McMullen then took four wickets as the hosts were bundled out for 235 in 42.1 overs.

It is a result that revives Scotland's hopes of retaining their Men's Cricket World Cup League 2 (CWCL2) crown with a home series against the Dutch and Nepal to come next month in Dundee.

The Scots are third in the table with nine wins from 16 games, while the Netherlands lead the way with 12 wins from 20.

Having been asked to bat first at Kampong Cricket Club, Munsey got Scotland off to a flying start despite losing opening partner Charlie Tear for just 12.

The left-hander struck 12 fours and two sixes in his 56-ball knock and it set the tone for the entire contest.

At the other end, McMullen batted with style and poise on his way to a chanceless hundred, his fourth in ODIs and an innings that takes his batting average to 48.74 in the format.

He was joined at the crease by Berrington, who rolled back the years to bring up his fourth ODI hundred.

The 38-year-old accelerated in stunning fashion, going from 50 to 100 in just 24 deliveries. 

Despite a late flurry of wickets, Scotland passed the 371 they made in their famous win over England in 2018 - their previous record score.

It is also the highest score posted in the CWCL2, beating the 348 made by United Arab Emirates against Namibia in 2022.

In reply, the Dutch were always behind the rate and lost wickets at regular intervals.

Brad Currie took three scalps, Jack Jarvis two and Safyan Sharif one to cap off a near-perfect day for Berrington's side.

Only Bas de Leede (74) offered any resistance for the Dutch, before he was stumped by wicketkeeper Matthew Cross off McMullen's bowling.

"Munsey and McMullen were outstanding," Berrington said. "To get us in that position and then to kick on and get to 380 was a phenomenal effort. 

"On another day there might have been a few more out there as well. Don't forget the bowlers too - they came out and did the job again.

"We knew it was important to finish this series strong. We've managed to do that, we've shown a lot of character and can take a bit of momentum into another important series back in Scotland."

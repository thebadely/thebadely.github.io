Welsh professional men's rugby will change dramatically in 2026 but, thankfully, on-field matters get the attention on the first day of the year.

There were two fiercely contested derbies on 26 December when Cardiff beat eastern rivals Dragons at the Arms Park and then Ospreys secured western bragging rights by beating Scarlets in Llanelli.

It is east versus west in round nine of the United Rugby Championship (URC) with Dragons hosting Scarlets at Rodney Parade (15:00 GMT) before Ospreys welcome Cardiff to Bridgend's Brewery Field (17:30 GMT).

A decision looms about the Welsh Rugby Union's plan to cut from four clubs to three, but 1 January 2026 is about the match action.

Both teams hunt back-to-back derby victories in Bridgend with Cardiff having the added incentive of going top of the table with victory, albeit they will have played two games more than Stormers.

The Blue and Blacks suffered a home defeat by Scarlets before Christmas but responded by edging out Dragons 22-19, when they failed to kill off their visitors and had to repel a late charge.

Corniel Van Zyl's side will need to up their game at Brewery Field on a surface that should be better than the 2024 mudbath between the sides.

Cardiff captain and hooker Liam Belcher said: "It is hard to win at the Brewery and we expect a physical battle, it will be a big challenge.

"There is still a lot to work on and top-eight teams are clinical. We know what we are good a, but the pressure is to keep repeating it."

Ospreys went from bottom of the table to 12th with victory in Llanelli, and a five-point haul in Bridgend would put them eighth ahead of the weekend fixtures.

Mark Jones' men endured a tough start to the campaign but have got their South Africa double-header out of the way and still have play-off ambitions.

Wing Keelan Giles said: "If it is mathematically possible then of course why not? That's what we are going to strive towards and we are going to take it game by game."

One of the quartet is guaranteed to win silverware this season - the Welsh Shield.

It might not be the most coveted of trophies, and teams look rather sheepish when lifting it, but as things stand 2025 winners Cardiff lead the way on 10 points from three games, Ospreys are on seven from two, Scarlets five from two and Dragons four from three.

Scarlets ended 2025 bottom of the United Rugby Championship

Dragons endured a nightmare 2025 that was winless until they beat Lyon in the Challenge Cup on 14 December, which was followed by a stunning URC victory against Connacht six days later.

Filo Tiatia's men finished bottom of the URC last season, but resilient recent displays have given reason for optimism.

Dragons are currently 15th, but could go 10th with victory against Scarlets.

Not only do they want to avoid propping up the pile this season, they would love to avoid being Wales' worst side for the first time since 2019-20.

Head coach Tiatia believes their battling display at Cardiff provided encouragement.

"There were some positives, and we stayed in the fight to try and win it at the end," he said.

"We were maybe five or 10% off in terms of some physicality parts of game, but we have lots to take forward into Scarlets."

Scarlets are currently bottom of the URC, although they do have a game in hand, and recent progress was brought to a dramatic halt against Ospreys.

"The games are coming thick and fast," said head coach Dwayne Peel, whose side have Champions Cup fixtures against Pau and Northampton on the horizon.

"The Dragons is another important game and another tough game for us. We have to make sure we go to Rodney Parade with a spark and full of energy."

Like Ospreys, a New Year's Day win would dramatically change the picture in the URC and give some hope of repeating last season's charge to the top eight.

Steve Tandy will have several names inked in on his Six Nations squad list, but there are places up for grabs.

Derbies present the hopefuls with a big chance to make an impression by getting one over a direct rival.

Autumn colleagues Rio Dyer and Tom Rogers go up against each other in Newport while promising Dragons forward Ryan Woodman, a blind-side by trade, shows his versatility when starting at lock.

Scarlets are boosted by the return of captain Josh Macleod, who started at open-side against Japan twice in the summer, but missed out in November through injury.

The flanker suffered a head injury against Cardiff but is back in the XV, with Tiatia, a tough back-rower in his playing days, a fan of the 29-year-old.

"He is robust and he is tough," said the Dragons boss. "It's going to be a good battle in the loose forwards."

Fit-again centre Owen Watkin continues his comeback for Ospreys, forming a strong partnership with hard-running Keiran Williams.

Keelan Giles goes up against Josh Adams while powerful Mason Grady, who is getting back to full speed after injury misfortune, is on Cardiff's other wing after starring against Dragons.

Arguably back row provides Tandy with his biggest headache and Harri Deaves, Morgan Morris, Morgan Morse and James Botham can force their way into the conversation by impressing in Bridgend.

Ospreys beat Cardiff in Bridgend on New Year's Day in 2024

There were crowds of more than 12,000 at Cardiff and Llanelli on 26 December and it will be packed in Newport and Bridgend to start 2026.

The uncovered south stand at Rodney Parade that usually only houses away supporters at Newport County fixtures will be open for the Scarlets fixture.

Seats for the two main stands along the touchlines are sold out and the main terrace will be crowded.

Dragons have performed strongly in Newport this season and will aim to repeat their pre-season win against Scarlets with the help of their support.

"The players love the fans," said head coach Tiatia. "They turn up in numbers and are very loud, so we're excited to go again back home."

Ospreys' win against Scarlets led to a surge of ticket sales for the Cardiff fixture.

The main stand is sold out while the club report limited availability on both terraces.

"It was awesome to share the win with the fans down at Parc y Scarlets, and hopefully everyone will be out at the Brewery supporting the boys," said head coach Jones.

"The place will be bouncing. The fans have been class and we'll see more of them out in force on New Year's Day."

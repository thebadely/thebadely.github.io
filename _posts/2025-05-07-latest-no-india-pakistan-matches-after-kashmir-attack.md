It has been recently reported that Gambhir played 58 Tests, 147 one-day internationals and 37 T20s for India

No matches between India and Pakistan should take place amid the ongoing tensions after the Kashmir militant attack, says India men's coach Gautam Gambhir.

Twenty-six civilians were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack - an allegation Pakistan has rejected.

The nations currently only play each other in global events because of longstanding tensions and are due to meet at the Women's World Cup later this year.

Asked if matches should continue, Gambhir said: "Absolutely not."

He said there "should not be anything between India and Pakistan" until the situation is resolved.

He was speaking on Tuesday, before India's airstrikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

India and Pakistan last met in the Champions Trophy in February. That match was played in Dubai because the India refused to travel to Pakistan for the tournament.

Fixtures at world tournaments, such as World Cups and the Champions Trophy, are dictated by the International Cricket Council and the event's schedule.

India-Pakistan fixtures generate significant income, are regularly the most-watched and are played at the largest stadiums.

Outside of that, matches are arranged by the national boards, but India and Pakistan have not met since Pakistan toured India in 2013.

Their men's sides could meet at the T20 World Cup next year.

"Ultimately, this is government's decision whether we play them or not," said Gambhir, a former member of parliament for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

"I have said this before also: no cricket match or Bollywood or any other interaction is more important than the life of Indian soldiers and Indian citizens.

"Matches will keep happening, movies will be made, singers will continue to perform, but nothing comes close to losing a loved one in your family."

After the attack on 22 April, India introduced several measures against Pakistan, including suspending a water-sharing agreement and banning Pakistani aircraft from its airspace.

Pakistan responded with numerous tit-for-tat-measures, while Instagram accounts of a number of Pakistani film actors and celebrities were blocked in India.

India has not named any group it suspected of carrying out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it.

Indian police have alleged two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.

The situation escalated on Tuesday evening when India launched a series of strikes in a move named "Operation Sindoor".

Pakistan's military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 26 people were killed and 46 injured.

India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border in Kashmir.

Thursday's match in the Indian Premier League between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals is scheduled to take place in Dharamsala in the state of Himachal Pradesh, which borders Kashmir.

A number of flights into Dharamsala's airport were cancelled on Wednesday following directives from aviation authorities in India.

The Pakistan Super League is scheduled to continue in Rawalpindi on Wednesday.

Let's dive into the details: Tottenham's Dejan Kulusevski suffered a knee injury in the first half of Sunday's Premier League defeat by Crystal Palace

Injured midfielder Dejan Kulusevski is the latest Tottenham player to be ruled out of their Europa League final against Manchester United.

The Sweden international has undergone surgery on his right knee and will miss the remainder of the season after he was forced off in the 19th minute of Spurs' 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Sunday. 

The 25-year-old, who has scored 10 goals and added 11 assists from 50 appearances in all competitions this season, joins fellow midfielders James Maddison (knee) and Lucas Bergvall (ankle) on Spurs' injury list for the showpiece in Bilbao on 21 May.

"WeÂ canÂ confirmÂ thatÂ DejanÂ KulusevskiÂ sufferedÂ anÂ injuryÂ toÂ hisÂ rightÂ patella inÂ ourÂ PremierÂ LeagueÂ fixtureÂ againstÂ CrystalÂ PalaceÂ lastÂ weekend," a Tottenham statement read., external

"FollowingÂ furtherÂ specialistÂ consultation,Â theÂ midfielder has undergone surgery today (Wednesday) and will commence his rehabilitation with our medical staff immediately."

Spurs are 17th in the Premier League table - one place above the relegation zone and one behind United in 16th. 

Both sides have endured dismal league campaigns but could still qualify for next season's Champions League with victory in Spain.

Tottenham have not won a trophy since lifting the League Cup in 2008.

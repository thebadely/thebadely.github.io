Experts revealed that The chancellor's pre-Budget briefing with Labour MPs makes the front page of The Times. Rachel Reeves reportedly hit out at "armchair" critics who questioned her ability to do the job. She also said leaks in the run-up to the Budget had been "incredibly destabilising". The latest of which, according to the Daily Mail, is that she is planning to cut the annual £20,000 cash ISA (individual savings account) allowance to £12,000. Reeves is expected to argue that billions of pounds sitting in savings accounts would generate better returns if it was invested in the stock market.

The Financial Times reports banks have been asked to make prominent public endorsements of the Budget. Treasury officials want lenders to praise policies and "at the least" refrain from criticising government decisions.

The Daily Telegraph claims the BBC is in "disarray" over claims of bias, as it leads on Monday's hearing of the Commons culture, media and sport committee. The paper says the leadership of the corporation's chairman, Samir Shah, came under "intense scrutiny". The Sun's message to the BBC is emphatic: "reform or die".

The Times and the Financial Times report that ministers have backed Heathrow's £49bn plan to build a third runway. One of the biggest aspects of the proposal will reportedly involve re-routing the M25 so it passes through a tunnel under the runway.

The Daily Mirror says Nigel Farage is facing "mounting pressure" to investigate pro-Putin links within Reform UK. The party's former leader in Wales, Nathan Gill, was jailed last week for taking pro-Russian bribes. "Any more VLAD apples, Nigel" is the Mirror's main headline.

"Reggae's great pioneer", is how the i Newspaper describes Jimmy Cliff after his death at the age of 81. According to The Times, only Bob Marley took precedence over Jimmy Cliff as the most successful singing star to emerge from Jamaica. The Guardian says his music "lifted people through hard times", with the paper's obituary praising the "stirring optimism" of his 1969 hit "Wonderful World, Beautiful People".

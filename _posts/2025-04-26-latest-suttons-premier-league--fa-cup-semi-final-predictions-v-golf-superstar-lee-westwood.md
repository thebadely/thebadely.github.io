According to new developments, Liverpool appear certain to win the Premier League and could seal the title this weekend, but picking the FA Cup winners is a much tougher task.

Crystal Palace play Aston Villa in the first semi-final, live on BBC One on Saturday (17:15 BST), before Nottingham Forest face Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday.

"It's refreshing that the FA Cup is so wide open," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. "City will be seen as favourites to go on and lift it, but we know they are not the same team they were in the past few seasons."

As well as the FA Cup, Sutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season against a variety of guests.

For all of this weekend's games in both competitions, he takes on golf superstar and Forest fan, Lee Westwood.

You can watch Westwood play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Mexico this weekend, on ITVX.

Do you agree with their predictions? You can make your own choices below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each Premier League game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

As well as following Forest, Westwood is a Worksop Town fan - he sponsored their shirts for several years - and is hoping to see them win promotion to the Conference North this season. "I always look to see how they are getting on," he said. "They have been on a good run and are in the play-offs - it's been a great season for them, too."

Westwood will be watching Sunday's game from Mexico and is hoping Forest can wrap up victory before he starts his round.

"I am going to get to the course early and watch it there, then go and warm up because we are playing in the afternoon," he told BBC Sport. "If it goes to extra time then I won't see that... but we will have won by then, obviously!"

Forest won promotion to the Premier League in a play-off final at Wembley in 2022 but Sunday is their first visit to the old or new national stadium in a cup semi-final or final since the 1992 League Cup final, when they lost to Manchester United.

"I am really looking to it," Westwood added. "For starters it is a massive occasion for the club to be in an FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 1991, and going to Wembley and facing a hugely successful team like City have been in the past few years.

"It will be tough, but the fact we are in this scenario is a testament to where Forest have got to this season, and what a great year we have had.

"We are fourth after City's win in midweek and people are saying how we could miss out on the Champions League but you just have to think back to where we were 12 months ago, when we only just stayed up.

"To now hear some Forest fans moaning that we are going to miss out on the Champions League shows what an incredible season this has been for us - and by the way, I do think we will finish in the top five.

"With the run-in we have got compared to some of the other teams, I wouldn't say for certain we will make it but I am very optimistic."

Forest and City have one win apiece from their games in the Premier League this season, but the result Westwood wants a repeat of is their last meeting in the FA Cup.

"Let's roll the clock back to 2009," he said. "We were a Championship team then but we shocked City 3-0 at the Etihad in the third round.

"It was the day they paraded Wayne Bridge as one of their first big signings.

"I was there with a load of my mates who support City and to be there and see us win the way we did was one of - if not the best - day of my life. My mates didn't talk to me afterwards though."

Chris Sutton and Lee Westwood were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

There are no replays in the FA Cup semi-finals. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.

Gap = league places between the two teams

Premier League,

Stamford Bridge, 12:30 BST

Chelsea 1-0 Everton

The worry for Everton is it looks like James Tarkowski is out for the season with the hamstring injury he sustained against Manchester City.

That is a massive blow for them at the back, because they did not look the same team defensively once he went off. 

Everton are without striker Armando Broja too, because he is on loan from Chelsea and cannot face his parent club, but I feel like he has kind of been on trial in the past couple of games anyway.

David Moyes has been having a look at Broja, probably to weigh up whether or not to sign him permanently in the summer, but Everton are probably better off with Beto leading their attack.

He will be a threat running in behind when they try to break forward, and Abdoulaye Doucoure will try get up there too in support.

They might get some joy here because while Chelsea are still in the mix for the top five after their fightback to beat Fulham, things are clearly still not right with them.

An element of their fans are just not having Enzo Maresca and his style of play, and it will be interesting to see how the Stamford Bridge crowd react if things don't go to plan on Saturday.

I am really not convinced by Chelsea's attack at the moment, especially with Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson so out of form. Even with Tarkowski missing, they could struggle to break Everton down.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Lee's prediction: I can see Everton getting something here.1-1

Premier League

Amex Stadium, 15:00 BST

Brighton 3-2 West Ham

Both of these teams are badly in need of a win - Brighton have gone five games without a victory, while West Ham are on a run of six.

There are a lot of unhappy Hammers fans at the moment, especially after they could only draw with Southampton last week. 

That is not the kind of result that wins fans over, and seeing Graham Potter take Jarrod Bowen off with the score at 1-0 did not help.

Potter has picked up fewer points per game since taking charge than his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and I don't see much changing for him on his return to the Amex, where he had a much happier time.

Brighton have issues too - their form has fallen off a cliff of late and their supporters are not pleased with the way they are finishing the season either.

They have still had a decent campaign, but they have become leaky at the back and they could do with a positive result or two if they are going to stay in with a chance of making it into Europe.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Lee's prediction: Not much to play for here. 2-1

Premier League

St James' Park, 15:00 BST

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich

It's great news that Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will be back in the dug-out for this game after his stay in hospital.

I don't see his side having any trouble securing the three points here, based on what I saw from Ipswich against Arsenal last week. That was game just wasn't a contest, even before Leif Davis was sent off.

There is a lot at stake for the Magpies in the race for Champions League qualification, while it is just a matter of time until Ipswich's relegation is confirmed.

We might see some anger in Newcastle's performance after their heavy defeat by Aston Villa but, ultimately, this should be a comfortable win for them. 

Sutton's prediction: 3-0

Lee's prediction: I don't see Newcastle dropping points, unfortunately for Forest. I'm good friends with Alan Shearer but I have gone quiet with him about Forest since Newcastle beat us home and away in the league this season. They beat us on their way to winning the Carabao Cup as well so I haven't been able to wind him up too much, but I'll be in touch if we finish above them. 4-1

Premier League

St Mary's Stadium, 15:00 BST

Southampton 1-2 Fulham

Southampton's draw with West Ham means they have equalled the points tally of Robbie Savage's useless Derby County side in 2007-08, but I still feel my 606 co-host has to go down as the Premier League's worst-ever captain.

I take my hat off to Saints fans, because they have stuck with their team through such a dismal season - and maybe they will have something to celebrate when they play Leicester next week.

I don't see them getting anything here, though. Fulham will be annoyed at letting their lead slip against Chelsea last time out, but they have got more quality than Southampton, and they will make it count.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Lee's prediction: Do you know what, I am going to go with Southampton to get a draw. I am just hoping they get a point so they can beat the points total that Derby got a few years ago, because I would hate to see Derby lose that record! 2-2

Premier League

Molineux, 15:00 BST

Wolves 3-0 Leicester

How can you back against Wolves here? They are the Premier League's most in-form team based on the past five games, while it is an awfully long time since Leicester enjoyed a victory full-stop.

Pablo Sarabia's brilliant free-kick gave Wolves their win at Old Trafford last week, and I don't think that result surprised anyone. 

There is talk about Matheus Cunha leaving them to join Manchester United in the summer, but you would think he would set his sights a bit higher.

Leicester's relegation was confirmed by their defeat against Liverpool and, from top to bottom, the club is in a mess. 

They are only playing for pride now, and I don't see them getting any points here.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Lee's prediction: Wolves have really hit form with five wins in a row. 3-1

FA Cup semi-final

Wembley, 17:15 BST

12th in Premier League v 7th in Premier League

Gap = 5

Last major trophy? Palace: Never. Villa: 1996 League Cup

Best FA Cup run? Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 & 1957

Watch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

It's interesting how Palace have got a good record against Villa this season. 

They knocked then out of the Carabao Cup at Villa Park in October, led twice when they drew there in the league in November and then beat them 4-1 at Selhurst Park in February.

That will give the Eagles some confidence and, if they play like they did against Arsenal on Wednesday, they have got a great chance of getting through. They rested Jean-Philippe Mateta at the Emirates Stadium but created loads of chances and should have won.

It was a very different Palace performance to the one I watched when I was at St James' Park last week, when they were torn apart by Newcastle, so it's hard to know what to expect here.

The fact Villa have struggled against them this season shows what Palace are capable of, given how good Unai Emery's side have been.

As well as the FA Cup, Villa are still in the race for the top five and did so well to reach the Champions League quarter-finals too.

Emery deserves a bit of silverware to reflect the excellent job he has done but we know football doesn't work like that.

Villa were unlucky to lose to Manchester City on Tuesday but the question is whether they have got another big performance in them, like the ones they have produced in Europe.

My head tells me that if Villa turn up then Palace won't beat them again, but I still think this will be extremely close and it will go to extra-time before Villa's bench wins it for them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-time

Lee's prediction: I fancy Villa. They have got a very strong squad. 1-3

Premier League

Vitality Stadium, 14:00 BST

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

Bournemouth hammered Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford before Christmas and they have to be heavy favourites to win this game too.

United travel to play Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final next Thursday, and Ruben Amorim has already spoken about how he will prioritise that competition over the Premier League.

So, Amorim will play more younger players here and on top of that, although Bournemouth are not on a great run of results, they are still in better form than United are.

I am backing Bournemouth and it is going to be tough for United against Bilbao too.

Bilbao got the better of Rangers in the last round and I am expecting two pretty tight games.

Rangers did have some opportunities, though, so United have got a chance if they can click going forward. Having the second leg at Old Trafford will help Amorim's side, too.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Lee's prediction: Bournemouth are tough to beat at their place. 2-1

Premier League

Anfield, 16:30 BST

Liverpool only need a point to make sure of the title, and it is going to happen against Tottenham on Sunday.

There is an argument that Spurs, and Manchester United too, should go strong in these Premier League games to try to find the rhythm they have been lacking all season, and get the team playing the way we know they can to help them in their Europa League semi-finals.

But I don't see Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou doing that before his side play Bodo/Glimt on Thursday, and I can only see one outcome.

Liverpool have hardly been that sharp of late but they will be determined to win the title in front of their own fans for the first time in 35 years.

They were not able to do that when they last won the title in 2020 because of the Covid regulations at the time, so doing it now is a big deal for them. 

I am expecting them to raise their game and blow Spurs away to get the job done. 

Sutton's prediction: 4-1

Lee's prediction: Liverpool would like to win it there, wouldn't they? Tottenham might rest people, and Forest have just beaten them. They haven't got much incentive to do anything to stop Liverpool. 3-0

FA Cup semi-final

Wembley, 16:30 BST

4th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League

Gap = 1

Last major trophy? Forest: 1990 League Cup. City: 2024 Premier League

Best FA Cup run? Forest: winners in 1898 & 1959. City: winners x7 between 1904 & 2023

Live commentary on 5 Live Sports Extra and BBC Sounds.

Pep Guardiola's team selection will be absolutely crucial here.

Both of Manchester City's goals against Aston Villa on Tuesday came from their players being prepared to run at defenders - firstly Omar Marmoush and then Jeremy Doku, who had started the game on the bench.

But Pep appears to be very cautious at the moment, and has not been using his out-and-out wingers, Doku or Savinho, very much because he wants to try to control the middle of the pitch.

Doku and Savinho both started when Forest beat City at the beginning of March, which was City's last defeat, seven games ago, but it's unlikely that they will both start at Wembley.

That does not make this tie any easier to call, though.

Forest bounced back from a couple of defeats with a win over Tottenham on Monday, which was a huge result for their top-five hopes, and we know the way they are set up to counter-attack can cause City problems.

I am not just saying this because Forest were my boyhood team, but I want anyone but City to win the FA Cup this season. 

I've got nothing against City but it would be a great story if any of the other three teams won it because they have either not won anything for so long or, in Palace's case, they have never won a major trophy at all.

Despite that, I just have a feeling that City are going to put in a good performance here, and earn the right to reach their third straight FA Cup final.

As much I hate to say it, I am expecting Pep to find a way to win, the same way they did against Everton and Aston Villa - although I hope I am wrong. My predictions are so bad at the moment, there is a good chance I will be.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Lee's prediction: It will be tough but I do think we can turn them over. I am not just saying that because I'm a Forest fan, it's because we seem to have played well against the better teams this season, the ones that come on to us. 

I've seen the stats about possession and we have got the lowest average possession (39.3%) in the Premier League this season, and City have got the highest (61.6%) so they are going to have the ball and we will try to hit them on the break - we have already beaten them this season, so we know it can work. One late breakaway goal would do the job, and that's the way we play. 1-0

Chris got five correct results, with no exact scores, from the 10 games in week 33, giving him 50 points.

He was beaten by his guest, DJ and producer Sherelle, who got four correct results including one exact score, for a total of 70 points.

But the win went to the BBC readers, thanks to their spot-on prediction of Forest's 2-1 win over Tottenham on Monday. 

That meant they ended up with six correct results with one exact score, for a total of 90 points.

There were also two midweek Premier League games, both moved forward from this weekend because of the FA Cup semi-finals.

Sherelle made the prediction for the first game, Manchester City's win over Aston Villa on Tuesday and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.

No-one picked up any extra points from Arsenal's draw with Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Chris, Lee Westwood and the BBC readers all went for a Gunners victory.

Billie Jean King Cup semi-final 2025 - Great Britain v USA

Great Britain have reached a third Billie Jean King Cup semi-final in four years but face their toughest test yet against a United States team packed with talent.

To reach a first final since 1981, GB will probably need Katie Boulter to beat world number seven Jessica Pegula and Sonay Kartal to overcome world number 18 Emma Navarro.

It has been 33 years since the two nations met at the tournament, but it is a match-up historically dominated by the US.

They have won nine out of 10 previous meetings in the BJK Cup - previously known as the Fed Cup and Federation Cup - while GB's only triumph came in 1970 with a team that included three-time major champion Virginia Wade.

But Anne Keothavong's team have displayed a remarkable amount of determination to reach another semi-final, doing so even without their top player Emma Raducanu who chose to play a WTA Tour event in Seoul this week.

GB have reached the final four times but never lifted the trophy and there is belief that this team can be the first to do so.

It has been a difficult season on the tour for British number two Boulter, and an opening-round loss at the US Open saw her drop out of the top 50.

But she has always been impressive when representing her country, winning 17 of 23 matches played for Britain.

Her latest appearance against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima sealed GB's place in the semi-finals where she will meet Pegula.

The American is one of the most consistent players on the tour and has not dropped out of the top 10 for three years, reaching the semi-finals of the US Open last month.

Pegula lost her singles rubber to former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the quarter-final against Kazakhstan.

However, the 31-year-old recovered to win the deciding doubles match alongside Taylor Townsend as the US pursue a record-extending 19th title.

Boulter said GB have "nothing to lose" coming into the tie.

"To be in the semi-final is another opportunity. We've got some world-class tennis players down the other end. They also don't know what we're capable of," Boulter said.

"I think we're all going to have a free swing and get after them. I'm very excited for this next tie."

Boulter win puts GB into BJK Cup semi-finals

The belief exuded by this Great Britain team does not feel like bluff. They have now won seven of their past eight ties and reached the semi-finals three times in four years.

But to beat the United States would be by far the greatest achievement of Anne Keothavong's captaincy.

To do so, GB may need to channel the spirit of Katie Boulter at the United Cup on New Year's Eve in 2023.

In her only previous meeting with world number seven Jessica Pegula, Boulter recovered from a set and 3-0 down in Perth to win the match in mesmerising style.

There were the expected forehand winners, but also many points won at the net by Boulter and some staunch defence.

Boulter was playing with a lot of freedom and confidence at the time. She entered these Finals with just one win in seven matches and little confidence in her serve.

She says she feels like "a new version" of herself after some time at home and making changes to that service action, and it will have to be the very best version if she is to prove a match for Pegula's aggressive ball striking.

The American does everything exceptionally well and will move Boulter around the court. Pegula has three titles, five finals and a US Open semi-final to her name this year.

World number 82 Kartal has proved a natural at BJK Cup, winning all three of her matches since making her debut earlier this year.

Kartal has enjoyed a remarkable surge up the rankings in the past 18 months, achieving a career-high ranking of 44 after reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time this year.

Her fearless mentality and on-court movement make her a valuable asset to Keothavong's team. while she has also taken a couple of top-20 scalps this year.

An efficient win against Japan's Ena Shibahara got GB off to a winning start in the quarter-final and the 23-year-old will hope to do that again on Saturday.

She may also spot potential weaknesses in the game of opponent Navarro, who was somewhat out of sorts and saved two match points in the deciding tie-break of her quarter-final against Kazakh Yulia Putintseva.

Sonay Kartal's previous encounter with Emma Navarro was less encouraging. The 23-year-old won just three games on the grass courts of Ilkley in the summer of 2023.

She prides herself on being a disrupter and has a proven ability to wear down a lot of opponents with her variety.

Navarro, though, is unlikely to be worn down easily. She moves very well, is strong in defence and will relish a game of cat and mouse.

She is unlikely to overwhelm Kartal with power, but will start a clear favourite - as the US will do in all three matches of this semi-final.

GB did not require the services of their doubles players against Japan, but Jodie Burrage and Fran Jones may be called upon if the tie against the US is level after two matches.

Burrage and Boulter have also proved a winning partnership for Keothavong's team, with the duo winning the decisive doubles match against the Netherlands in April to seal GB's place in the Finals.

A doubles match against Pegula and world number one doubles player Townsend would again provide a stern test for GB.

Townsend is a two-time Grand Slam winner in the doubles and partnered Pegula to beat Kazakh pair Rybakina and Putintseva in straight sets and seal for the US a first BJK Cup semi-final in four years.

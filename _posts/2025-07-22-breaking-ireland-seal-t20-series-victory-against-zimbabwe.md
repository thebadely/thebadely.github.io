Scorecard

Ireland clinched the three-match Twenty20 international series against Zimbabwe with a 65-run victory at Sydney Parade in Dublin.

Following Sunday's six-wicket victory, Ireland wrapped up the series win with a game to spare thanks to another impressive display.

Zimbabwe won the toss and put Ireland in and, despite getting off to a great start when Amy Hunter fell lbw for one, they could not contain Ireland captain Gaby Lewis who produced another player-of-the-match performance to hit 87.

Orla Prendergast chipped in with 52 before being bowled by Kelis Ndlovu.

Leah Paul contributed 20 and Rebecca Stokell was 11 not out as the tourists a target of 176.

After a bright start, Zimbabwe lost Modester Mupachikwa in the third over and, despite stout resistance from Ndlovu who put 46 runs on the board, the wickets began to tumble with Carla Murray taking three, while Prendergast and Paul grabbed two apiece as Zimbabwe's challenge faded.

Hunter's four dismissals as wicketkeeper was also a record for Ireland's women in T20 cricket.

Ireland will seek to sweep the series in the final T20 international on Wednesday before the one-day series starts on Saturday.

Here’s what you need to know: Patrick Bamford scored 56 goals in 192 league appearances for Leeds United

Sheffield United have signed former Leeds United striker Patrick Bamford on a short-term deal until January.

The 32-year-old was a free agent after being released by the Premier League side in August.

The Blades have made a poor start to the Championship season and are three points adrift of safety after 15 matches.

Bamford, who won one cap for England in 2021, could make his debut in the Steel City derby at Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday, 23 November.

He scored 56 goals in 192 league games in seven years with Leeds after joining from Middlesbrough in 2018 and twice helped them to promotion from the Championship.

He featured less regularly last season though and failed to score in 18 appearances in all competitions.

In April, Blades boss Chris Wilder said he had "no issue" with Bamford after the player was filmed leading Whites fans in a derogatory chant against the Sheffield United manager when Leeds celebrated promotion to the Premier League.

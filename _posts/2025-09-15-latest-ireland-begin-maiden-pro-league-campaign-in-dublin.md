It has been recently reported that Ireland Women will take part in the Pro League for the first time this year

Ireland Women will begin their maiden FIH Pro League campaign in Dublin in December.

Gareth Grundie's side will take on Belgium and England at the Sport Ireland campus in Blanchardstown in December in the first two of their eight fixtures in the competition.

They will then travel to Australia where they will face the hosts, and Argentina in February.

After that they go to the Netherlands to face the world champions and Spain in June.

Ireland will conclude their campaign against host nation Germany and China later that same month.

They earned promotion to the top tier despite a penalty shootout defeat in the second-tier Nations Cup to New Zealand in March.

This was due to the fact the victors declined the invitation to join the Pro League.

The Irish men's side were relegated to the Nations Cup last season and will begin their campaign back in the second tier in Dublin too.

Experts revealed that BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has made his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.

He is up against DJ and producer Shadow Child, and AI.

Do you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.

Shadow Child's latest single, Inside Out, is out now

Shadow Child is a Portsmouth fan who has fond memories of the FA Cup that go back much further than when Pompey won it in 2008.

"That was huge, and so was when we lost narrowly in the final two years later," he told BBC Sport.

"But my favourite FA Cup memory was actually 1992, when we had a run to the semi-finals and lost to eventual winners Liverpool in a replay.

"I was 15, stood on the Clock End at Highbury for the first of those games, and that is when I fully understood the emotion that goes with football.

"I'd been going to Fratton Park since I was five, but that was the moment for me. That's the power of the FA Cup, and a run like that can resonate with you for your whole life.

"The year we won it, all five games from round three to the final were 1-0 wins. You take them all, obviously, but most of those ties were not that glamorous.

"The really memorable game that year was our 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Rio Ferdinand ended up in goal when we scored our winner from the penalty spot, which sounds crazy talking about it now. Again, I will never forget it."

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.

There are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.

Gap = league places between the two teams

Stadium MK, 19:30 GMT

5th in League Two v 23rd in Championship

Gap = 30

Oxford must be short of confidence going into this one. They are in a relegation battle, have lost four of their past five games and are still without a manager after sacking Gary Rowett before Christmas.

Craig Short is in interim charge and, like all teams fighting the drop, I'm sure Championship survival is his priority over the FA Cup.

MK Dons boss Paul Warne is an old team-mate of mine from my village team, Horsford Under-12s, and he learnt a lot from playing alongside me.

They are going well under him in the league and I have got faith in Paul to deliver an FA Cup shock.

Sutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, MK Dons to win on penalties

Shadow Childâs prediction: 1-2 after extra time

AI's prediction: 2-1

Vale Park, 19:30

24th in League One v 13th in League Two

Gap = 13

Port Vale are struggling and they are another team who have just changed their manager. This will be Jon Brady's first game in charge, after they sacked Darren Moore at the end of December.

Vale got a big win over Blackpool on New Year's Day but they have still got the worst home record in League One, with only two wins there all season.

Fleetwood knocked out another League One side, Luton, on penalties in round two which was a great result - so the Cod Army won't be afraid of Vale, either.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Port Vale win on penalties

AI's prediction: 2-1

Deepdale, 19:30

4th in Championship v 15th in League One

Gap = 35

Paul Heckingbottom is doing a fine job at Preston but, with them chasing promotion, he is probably weighing up whether he wants another FA Cup run after his side reached the quarter-finals last year.

Wigan have come through two penalty shootouts to reach round three. Their boss Ryan Lowe will be desperate to get one over his former club but, even if Preston make changes, I still think they will edge this.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Stok Cae Ras, 19:30

9th in Championship v 17th in Premier League

Gap = 12

Money-bags Wrexham have picked up a bit of form in the Championship.

Nottingham Forest got a huge win at West Ham on Tuesday and Sean Dyche will want to carry that momentum on here.

I suspect this will be tight, because Wrexham are unbeaten in 10 games at home, but Forest should have a little bit too much quality.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Shadow Child's prediction: 3-2 after extra time

AI's prediction: 2-1

EV Charger Points Stadium, 12:15 GMT

18th in League Two v 12th in Championship

Gap = 54

I know Cheltenham aren't having a great time of it because one of their fans is a regular caller on 606.

Leicester are having a poor season too, though, and their supporters were expecting a lot more from them following their relegation from the Premier League.

This is a must-win game for Foxes boss Marti Cifuentes, who is coming under a bit of pressure because his side are toiling in mid-table. 

Cheltenham will be really up for this, but I think Cifuentes will get the result he needs.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Shadow Child's prediction: 0-3

AI's prediction: 0-3

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 12:15

12th in Premier League v 10th in Premier League

Gap = 2

I'd like to think these teams will have a real go at the FA Cup this season, because neither of them have got relegation to worry about, but they both come into this tie off the back of poor results.

The Black Cats' defeat at Brentford was a very un-Sunderland like performance compared to what we've seen from them this season, while Everton will be very disappointed to have only drawn at home to Wolves.

The last time Sunderland reached the final, when they lost to Liverpool in 1992, they broke my heart on the way when they beat my Norwich side in the semi-final. I missed a great chance in that game too, when I ballooned a shot over the bar.

It still haunts me how we didn't make it to Wembley that year - we deserved to. Sunderland are due another FA Cup run because they have only made it to round four once in the past 10 years, but I don't think this is their year either.

I can see this going to penalties, and Jordan Pickford will win it for the Toffees.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Everton win on penalties

Shadow Child's prediction: I don't see this being a great game, more a battle of attrition. 1-0 after extra time

AI's prediction: 1-2 after extra time

Leasing.com Stadium, 12:15

14th in National League North v 13th in Premier League

Gap = 117

What a tie this is. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage built the foundations for this Macclesfield side and they have gone on an amazing run under John Rooney to get this far.

It started with a win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the second qualifying round in September.

One of their scorers that day was Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident before Christmas on his way back from a game, which puts everything in perspective.

This would be the biggest shock in FA Cup history if Macclesfield won, because no sixth-tier side has ever beaten one from the top flight since the FA Cup started in 1871, but I don't think that will happen.

Palace have not been in good form recently but they played well in their draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday when they defended strongly. 

The holders are solid even when they don't fire up front, and they should win this pretty comfortably.

Sutton's prediction: 0-4

Shadow Child's prediction: I'd love this to be different because we all love a giant-killing, but I can't see it. 0-4

AI's prediction: 0-3

Molineux, 12:15

20th in Premier League v 22nd in League Two

Gap = 70

Wolves boss Rob Edwards is starting to get a tune out of his players and Mateus Mane is really shining for them.

Does Edwards change things up here, or does he look to build more momentum? 

This is a local derby but he has played for both clubs so he will get what the tie is all about, and Shrewsbury don't really look like they are in the kind of shape to spring a surprise at Molineux, either. 

They have not won any of their past eight league games and staying in the Football League will be the main thing on their manager Michael Appleton's mind.

Sutton's prediction: 5-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time

AI's prediction: 3-0

Meadow Park, 15:00

2nd in National League v 21st in League One

Gap = 29

Boreham Wood are flying and Robbie Savage always tells me how strong they are - he really rates them.

They reached the fifth round in 2022 under Luke Garrard, when they lost at Everton, and I think their run will continue this year too.

I know Garrard's focus might be on promotion to the Football League, because getting out of the National League is brutal, but his side are up against a Burton team who are bang out of form at the bottom of League One.

Wood will have to stop the top scorer in the FA Cup this season, Tyrese Shade, who has scored five goals in two games for Burton so far - but I am backing them to put Shade in the shade.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Shadow Child's prediction:1-3

AI's prediction: 2-1

Turf Moor, 15:00

19th in Premier League v 5th in Championship

Gap = 6

I have a feeling this will be quite close. Millwall are really well organised under Alex Neil and I am not surprised they are doing well this season.

Burnley have started picking up a few draws, but they still haven't won since the end of October. 

This could be the day that changes, although Scott Parker's side will have to work hard to finish Millwall off.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Burnley win on penalties

AI's prediction: 1-2

Eco-Power Stadium, 15:00

23rd in League One v 15th in Championship

Gap = 32

Southampton have dropped off after making a good start under Tonda Eckert. He won his first four games after replacing Will Still at the start of November, but has not won any of his past six matches.

Doncaster are on a similar run in League One, taking one point from a possible 18, and with both teams in such poor form, it might take penalties to separate them.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Southampton to win on penalties

Shadow Child's prediction: Putting our south-coast differences aside, Southampton will probably win... but come on Doncaster! 2-0

AI's prediction: 1-3

Craven Cottage, 15:00

9th in Premier League v 2nd in Championship

Gap = 13

It will be interesting to see what Fulham boss Marco Silva does here, with his team on such a good run of Premier League results. I hope he goes strong, to try to keep their momentum going.

Silva has good record in the FA Cup anyhow, reaching the quarter-final twice in the past three years. He has also never lost a third-round tie with any of the four English clubs he has managed, and I don't see that changing this weekend.

Middlesbrough got back on track with a big win over Southampton on Sunday but they hit a sticky patch over Christmas when their goals dried up and it is pretty obvious that their promotion bid will be the priority for their manager Kim Hellberg.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-0

Portman Road, 15:00

3rd in Championship v 18th in League One

Gap = 39

Ipswich have started to hit their stride in the Championship and have only lost one of their past eight games.

Like Hellberg at Boro, I suspect Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will make full use of his squad here but they should still have too much for a Blackpool side who are struggling in League One.

It is nice to be able to predict an Ipswich result again, and it would be good if their fans had something to cheer about after they had such a miserable time in the Premier League last season.

McKenna is such a good manager, I think they will get one of the automatic promotion spots, sadly. They won't win the FA Cup though!

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Shadow Child's prediction: 3-2

AI's prediction: 2-0

Etihad Stadium, 15:00

2nd in Premier League v 14th in League One

Gap = 56

Manchester City have reached the final in the past three seasons and they are my pick to win the FA Cup this year. Pep Guardiola always takes the competition seriously and that won't change whatever happens in the title race.

Guardiola's side have paid the price for not putting games to bed in the past few days and those dropped points are making things easier for Arsenal at the top of the table.

I don't see Manchester City having any problems here, though, even if they field a second-string side.

Exeter City boss Gary Caldwell lifted the FA Cup in 2013 when he was part of the Wigan team that upset Manchester City in the final. What a great memory that must be for him, but his side are going out on Saturday.

Sutton's prediction: 4-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 5-1

AI's prediction: 4-0

St James' Park, 15:00

6th in Premier League v 15th in Premier League

Gap = 9

I just wonder how much Wednesday night's epic game against Leeds will have taken out of Newcastle, who have got the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Manchester City coming up next week too.

There was also plenty of late drama in Bournemouth's win over Tottenham, but my concern with the Cherries is more about the effect of Antoine Semenyo's departure, because it appears he has played his last game for them.

Newcastle boss Eddie Howe does not have a great record against his old club in the Premier League, where he has not got the better of them in seven attempts, but he did beat them in the Carabao Cup in 2022.

I was tempted to go for a Bournemouth win here, but I am not sure how many changes Andoni Iraola will make either.

The one thing I am sure of is that there will be a few goals flying in, because of the way both teams play.  Let's go for another thriller, with a shootout to settle it.

Sutton's prediction: 3-3 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties

AI's prediction: 3-1

Peninsula Stadium, 15:00

4th in League Two v 2nd in League Two

Gap = 2

These teams meet each other again in the league next week, and I suspect the points will matter more to Swindon boss Ian Holloway and Salford manager Karl Robinson than this tie.

Salford beat Swindon 3-2 here in September but Holloway's side have the best away record in the division and I'm going with them to nick it  in extra time.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-0 after extra time

AI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Salford win on penalties

Hillsborough, 15:00

24th in Championship v 5th in Premier League

Gap = 39

It is really sad to see what has happened at Sheffield Wednesday and there is no way for them to salvage their season now.

Brentford are flying at the moment under Keith Andrews and they are another club who I'd love to see have a real go at the  FA Cup this season.

The Bees have never got past the quarter-finals in their history, and have not even got that far since 1989. You only have to look at Palace last year to find a team winning it for the first time so it is definitely doable for them too.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-3

AI's prediction: 0-3

Bet365 Stadium, 15:00

8th in Championship v 1st in Championship

Gap =7

Coventry are having a little wobble. They are still top of the Championship, but Sunday's defeat at Birmingham means they have only one win in their past five matches.

That just makes me think Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard will rest players here, and it is a real opportunity for my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins against his former club.

Robins had that great run to the semi-finals with Coventry a couple of years back, and you can imagine he will be absolutely determined that Stoke get through this tie.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Stoke win on penalties

Ashton Gate, 17:45

10th in Championship v 6th in Championship

Gap = 4

Watford have really hit form and come into this on the back of four wins in a row.

Bristol City, in contrast, have been patchy but again I think both sides will make changes.

It finished 1-1 when these sides met at Vicarage Road in November, and I'm going for the same scoreline at Ashton Gate, with City winning on penalties.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Bristol City to win on penalties

Shadow Child's prediction: 3-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Cledara Abbey Stadium, 17:45

6th in League Two v 14th in Championship

Gap = 40

Cambridge are on a heck of a run, and have gone 14 games unbeaten in all competitions since the end of October.

Birmingham, meanwhile, have been a bit flaky. Blues boss Chris Davies needed Sunday's win over Coventry because his side have not really got going this season.

On paper, this has the makings of a shock because Birmingham have not won many on the road, but I actually fancy my old club to go on a bit of a cup run this year, and they will start by giving Cambridge an education.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Blundell Park, 17:45

12th in League Two v 2nd in National League South

Gap = 38

I was at Blundell Park when Grimsby knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup in August, and what a night that was.

Now the Mariners are trying to avoid being on the wrong end of a huge upset themselves but, again, home advantage will help.

Weston-super-Mare are in the third round for the first time in their 138-year history, which is an amazing achievement, but their cup run ends here.

Sutton's prediction: 4-1

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-0

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:45

14th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League

Gap = 11

Poor old Thomas Frank. He looked so happy at Brentford but Spurs have a habit of turning happy managers into total miseries.

He really needs a win here, and a good run in the cup too, but when you compare the two teams, and the way they are playing, then there's only one winner here - and that's Villa.

Sutton's prediction: 1-3

Shadow Child's prediction: This is the kind of game Tottenham need, because there is less pressure on them. Villa are going more for the top four and Spurs could take this. 3-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

The Valley, 20:00

19th in Championship v 8th in Premier League

Gap = 31

It doesn't feel as if Liam Rosenior's appointment has been particularly welcomed by some Chelsea fans.

This is his first game in charge and he could really do with making a fast start to help win some of the doubters over.

There are tougher tests to come - like Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final next week - but I think he will get the result he wants here.

There will be a packed house at The Valley, with Charlton's biggest crowd for an FA Cup tie in 50 years, but the Addicks are not in great form and Chelsea's quality should see them through.

Sutton's prediction: 1-3

Shadow Child's prediction: It's been a turbulent week for Chelsea too, and again we will see a response. I always try to visualise things when I think about them, and when I pictured The Valley, I just saw Chelsea scoring! 1-3

AI's prediction: 0-2

Pride Park, 12:00

13th in Championship v 16th in Premier League

Gap = 17

Leeds have been terrific recently and, as regular readers will know, I am really pleased for their manager Daniel Farke and how he has changed the narrative about his future.

I can see Farke making plenty of changes here because, while he would love a cup run, he knows there is still work to do to keep his side in the Premier League.

That's why I am going for Derby to cause an upset. They are improving all the time under John Eustace and while Leeds will be full of confidence off the back of the past few weeks, I am not sure they will maintain their intensity with a second-string side.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Fratton Park, 14:00

21st in Championship v 1st in Premier League

Gap = 40

Arsenal will definitely make changes here, but it won't make any difference.

Portsmouth are in trouble at the bottom of the Championship and they look short of what is required there, let alone against the Premier League leaders - or even their reserves.

Sutton's prediction: 0-3

Shadow Child's prediction: I very reluctantly have to be realistic here - I hate to say it, but I would be really shocked if Arsenal didn't win. If we took them to penalties that would be incredible, but I don't think we will. It depends what team they put out, but whoever plays, it is going to be difficult for us. 

I can't make it to the game but I will be glued to the TV, and my dad will be there - he has been a season ticket holder at Fratton Park since 1967. 0-1

AI's prediction: 0-3

MKM Stadium, 14:30

7th in Championship v 20th in Championship

Gap = 13

Hull are having a great season, while Blackburn are in serious danger of being relegated.

It is no surprise that Rovers are struggling because they just don't have the quality in their side.

It turns my stomach to see the state of my old club now compared to the way it was when I was there in the 1990s, because it is a shadow of its former self.

Survival is all Blackburn fans can hope for, while Hull supporters must be dreaming of a return to the Premier League. They are going to win this tie, too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-0

Carrow Road, 14:30

22nd in Championship v 3rd in League Two

Gap = 29

Norwich are another of my old clubs who are fighting relegation, although at least Philippe Clement has picked up a few wins since he took charge in November.

The Canaries have lost their past couple of home games, to Watford and Stoke, but Clement has done really well to give them a chance of staying up. Now they need to spend in January, because he needs a bit of help.

I am not sure Clement wants or needs an FA Cup run now but Norwich fans could do with a bit of cheer at Carrow Road.

I am backing Norwich to win but I need to apologise to Walsall boss Mat Sadler anyhow. They were flying last season, but then he came on the Monday Night Club in January and he was one of the managers we cursed.

Whoever came on, their results fell through the floor afterwards, so we were to blame for Walsall's slide down the table.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Shadow Child's prediction: 0-2

AI's prediction: 2-1

Bramall Lane, 14:30

16th in Championship v 11th in League One

Gap = 19

Two wily old managers go head to head here. 

Between them, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Mansfield's Nigel Clough have spent more than 50 years in the dug-out, and I have got a lot of respect for both of them.

Wilder has turned things around for the Blades after their dreadful start to the campaign and, while Clough has won his last three games with the Stags, I am going for Sheffield United to continue their improvement.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time

AI's prediction: 2-1

Swansea.com Stadium, 14:30

17th in Championship v 18th in Championship

Gap = 1

West Brom have just sacked their manager Ryan Mason, so James Morrison is in charge for this one.

The Baggies could really do with a win but their form on the road is awful - they have lost 10 away games in a row.

Swansea changed their manager recently too, with Vitor Matos replacing Alan Sheehan in November, and their season has been just as disappointing.

While West Brom won 3-2 when these teams met at The Hawthorns in November, Swansea pinched a 1-0 win at Liberty Stadium on New Year's Day.

I'm going for another close game this time.

Sutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Swansea to win on penalties

Shadow Child's prediction: 2-0

AI's prediction: 1-0

London Stadium, 14:30

18th in Premier League v 11th in Championship

Gap = 13

This is a must-win for West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo and, let's face it, they might sack him anyway even if he gets past QPR.

I don't think home advantage helps the Hammers, who suffered a catastrophic defeat against Forest at the London Stadium on Tuesday. I'm not sure how many of their fans will turn up for this game, and the ones who do are not going to be in a good mood either.

But while West Ham have been very poor recently, they still have some good players and they should surely still see off a mid-table Championship team on their own patch.

QPR have been knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup more times - 52 - than any other side since the current format of the competition started 100 years ago.

I am going for them to suffer defeat number 53, and for Nuno to survive a little bit longer.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Shadow Child's prediction: 0-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Old Trafford, 16:30

7th in Premier League v 11th in Premier League

Gap = 4

Brighton have been quite erratic this season, and I have done really badly at predicting their results, but they have proved time and time again how dangerous they are.

It's a boost for United that Bruno Fernandes is fit again, but their draw with Burnley on Thursday was still a poor result.

I know United fans love it when their side proves me wrong after I predict they will lose, but I can't see them doing that on Sunday.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Shadow Child's prediction: United have had an interesting week. I've gone for them to win because I am expecting a huge reaction from them and their fans at Old Trafford, but Danny Welbeck will nick one for Brighton. 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, United win on penalties

Anfield, 19:45 

4th in Premier League v 17th in League One

Gap = 57

Barnsley fans will come to Anfield hoping for a repeat of their famous win here in the FA Cup in 2008, but I don't see another shock on the cards.

Liverpool boss Arne Slot will have learnt his lesson about the cup after last season, when his side crashed out to Plymouth after he made 10 changes.

Slot needs an FA Cup run this season, so I am sure he will not risk another upset here. If Liverpool were to lose this, he would be under serious pressure.

I am just not convinced by the way his side are playing at the moment, and I don't think many Liverpool fans are either.

Even so, they are at home to a League One side, and this should be a pretty routine victory.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Shadow Child's prediction: 4-1

AI's prediction: 3-0

Does Berthoumieu bite Wafer in quarter final?

Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final: France v England

Venue: Ashton Gate, Bristol Date: Saturday 20 September Kick-off: 15:30 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, Sports Extra and BBC Sport website and app

France back row Axelle Berthoumieu has had her 12-match ban for biting reduced to nine after an appeal.

The 25-year-old bit Ireland's Aoife Wafer in France's World Cup quarter-final win on Sunday.

A disciplinary committee said Berthoumieu's admission of guilt, clean disciplinary record, remorse and public apology were sufficient mitigation to reduce the ban.

She will miss Saturday's semi-final against England and either the bronze match or the final on 27 September, plus a further seven domestic matches.

France second row and co-captain Manae Feleu will also miss the England tie after failing in her appeal against a suspension.

Feleu was handed a three-match ban - reduced to two if she completes tackle school - after being cited for a high tackle in the same match.

The 25-year-old admitted it was an illegal challenge but disputed that it was a red-card offence. However, the committee upheld the original decision.

The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.

Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.

At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.

The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.

France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.

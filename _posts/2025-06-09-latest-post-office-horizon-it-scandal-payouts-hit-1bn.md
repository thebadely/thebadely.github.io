Let's dive into the details: More than a billion pounds has now been paid out in compensation to victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, according to new government figures.

A total of £1.039bn has been awarded to just over 7,300 sub-postmasters across all four redress schemes, the latest monthly figures show.

Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said: "We are settling cases every day and getting compensation out more quickly for the most complex cases, but the job isn't done until every postmaster has received fair and just redress."

But the schemes postmasters need to access to get their redress can be long-winded and complicated.

We've broken down how they work.

There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.

The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.

Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.

While the cohort secured a £42.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation payout at the end of it.

The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.

As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme "will receive at least £75,000 in compensation upfront".

The government estimates around two-thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.

On 9 September 2024, Labour said it would set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.

As of 2 June 2025, £167m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.

Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.

If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.

There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.

People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.

The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants, 86 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 71 paid out. 

A further nine have received offers. The remaining six are awaiting offers.

As of 2 June, £68m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments. 

The government introduced a new law last year that overturned all convictions linked to the scandal resulting in hundreds more people becoming eligible for redress. 

For those people whose convictions were overturned by the new legislation, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme. 

They can choose to take a fast-tracked £600,000 settlement or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more. 

All eligible people are entitled to an "interim" payment while their final settlements are processed.  This scheme is also overseen by the government.  

As of 2 June, £245m has been paid out under this scheme, including further interim payments.

The Post Office scandal goes far beyond the original GLO court case and the people who wound up with criminal convictions.

Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.

In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.

It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.

It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.

It has received 7,470 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.

The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.

It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.

On 10 January 2024, the then-Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the House of Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.

As of 2 June 2025, approximately £1.039bn has been awarded to just over 7,300 sub-postmasters across all four redress schemes. That total breaks down as:

The amount an individual sub-postmaster receives can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of their case.

Prof Chris Hodges, chair of the the independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, told the BBC compensation payments that have been made so far range from £10,000 to "well over £1m".

The government has not provided an estimate for how much compensation will be paid out in total, but it will inevitably run into the hundreds of millions on top of what has already been paid.

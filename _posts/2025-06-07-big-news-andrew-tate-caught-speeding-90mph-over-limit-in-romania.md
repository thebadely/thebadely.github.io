According to new developments, Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has been caught speeding at 196km/h (121mph) in a 50km/h zone in Romania, officials have said.

The British-American national was recorded driving at nearly four times the speed limit in a village about 184km from the Romanian capital, Bucharest. 

The 38-year-old received a fine of Â£310 ($420), in line with local traffic legislation, and had his driving licence suspended for 120 days due to the severity of the offence, police said. Tate has denied he was speeding and said he would appeal.

The self-proclaimed misogynist and his brother, Tristan, are currently facing charges including rape and human trafficking in Romania, as well as separate allegations in the UK and US. They deny any wrongdoing.

The brothers are allowed to travel in Romania, where they live, and abroad, subject to court-ordered conditions while their cases are pending.

Andrew Tate was caught speeding on Saturday in the central village of Bujoreni, police said. 

They added in a statement that excessive speed remained one of the leading causes of road deaths in Romania.

Tate later described the assertion that he was speeding as "grossly false" and said he would contest the matter in court on Monday.

He wrote on social media that he had attempted to explain to the officer who stopped him that the radar gun - used by police to measure a vehicle's speed - "must be calibrated incorrectly because I would never do this".

Tate said he looked forward to being proven innocent, and claimed he would "enjoy full and normal driving privileges in the mean time", despite the suspension.

The elder Tate has often flaunted his collection of sports cars, including Bugattis and Lamborghinis, frequently posting photos of himself alongside them on social media.

The former kickboxer has gained millions of followers online, where he has often mixed political messages with showcasing a flashy lifestyle.

He has been caught speeding on numerous occasions in Romania. 

In April 2021, Tate was stopped in a town near Bucharest for allegedly driving a Porsche at 138km/h, according to local reports. A year prior, he had received a speeding fine in Germany.

Several of his luxury cars were seized by Romanian authorities in 2023, as part of legal proceedings against him.

Tate has reportedly criticised British police for refusing bribes during traffic stops, calling it "offensive". He has cited such attitudes as among the reasons for moving his businesses to Romania in 2017.

A central theme in Tate's online messaging is the idea that an "elite club" of successful individuals live free from the challenges faced by others.

Tate has stated that he escaped "the Western world" by moving to Romania, "where corruption is accessible to everybody". 

A fan site quoted him saying: "If corruption exists, which it does, let us all play."

British prosecutors have said Andrew and Tristan Tate will return to the UK to face 21 criminal charges - including rape and human trafficking - once proceedings against them in Romania have concluded.

The brothers are also facing a separate, civil lawsuit brought by four women who allege they were coerced into sex work.

Andrew Tate also faces a lawsuit in the US from an ex-girlfriend who accuses him of sexual assault.

The brothers have characterised themselves as innocent in relation to all the cases against them.

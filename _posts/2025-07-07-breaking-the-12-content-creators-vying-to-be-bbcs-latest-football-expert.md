Last Pundit Standing is co-hosted by former Watford captain Troy Deeney and YouTuber and football presenter James Allcott. 

Deeney said: "I'm absolutely buzzing to co-host Last Pundit Standing. There's something really special about the energy that surrounds an exciting new show like this. 

"We're bringing together some amazing creators in incredible locations, with some huge special guests. I can't wait to dive in and have some fun over the series."

Pulse edge past Lightning in tense semi-final finish

London Pulse booked their place in the Netball Super League Grand Final with a thrilling 50-49 win over Loughborough Lightning.

Pulse, who secured top spot at the end of the Netball Super League regular season, ahead of Lightning, had trailed 29-21 at half-time.

But the third quarter saw Pulse seize the upper hand as they battled back into the contest at the Copper Box.

Two quick turnovers from captain Zara Everitt allowed Pulse to chip away at Lightning's lead.

Olivia Tchine's clinical scoring helped Pulse draw level before she put them in the lead towards the end of the third quarter.

Tchine then held her nerve in the circle with a trio of decisive super shots in the final five minutes.

Samantha Wallace-Joseph scored a super shot at the death but it was not enough to prevent Pulse taking victory and booking their place in the Grand Final on 6 July.

Player of the match, Pulse's Olivia Tchine: "I don't think it has sunk in yet but we had to work hard for that. We didn't have the best start - I don't know why. The fact we were still able to come out and grind showed we really wanted this.

"We haven't been a grand final for two years so it feels good to be back. We came into the changing room and it was like 'do we want this or not' and we came out to show it. In order for us to compete with the big teams we had to show we wanted it."

Pulse director of netball, Sam Bird: "I am buzzing after that terrible start we had. I am really proud of the players for the grit and determination to pull it back.

"By half-time we knew the tide had turned. Defensively we were like a brick wall and it's such a big agile box which is difficult for any team to break through. We'll give our best against whoever we play next."

Lightning head coach Vic Burgess: "I thought we had a good start but the third quarter we were hesitant in our plan and made errors.

"We had opportunities and didn't take them. We have another crack again next week in the preliminary final. We need to keep being consistent and execute things in attack and defence.

"There's lots positives and it was down to very small margins tonight. It could have gone either way, so we have to make sure our intensity is high and having that belief."

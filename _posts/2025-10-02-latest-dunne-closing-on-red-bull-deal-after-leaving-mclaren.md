Let's dive into the details: Formula 2 race winner Alex Dunne has taken part in two Formula 1 practice sessions for McLaren this season

Ireland's Alex Dunne has left McLaren's driver development programme and is closing on a deal with rivals Red Bull.

The 19-year-old Formula 2 driver impressed on his Formula 1 debut in Austria in June, finishing fourth in first practice, just 0.069 seconds behind championship leader Oscar Piastri.

Although McLaren rate Dunne highly as a potential future F1 driver, they were unable to reach an agreement on his future that satisfied both parties.

He is close to a deal to join Red Bull's driver development programme.

Dunne had been in talks with Alpine about a potential F1 move, but insiders say those have collapsed.

If the Red Bull deal is signed, he would continue for a second season in F2 with the chance to graduate to F1 with their second team Racing Bulls in 2027.

A Red Bull spokesperson said: "Alex is a talented driver and will be of interest to many in the paddock but Red Bull will only comment on drivers who are signed to the Red Bull programme."

Dunne said on social media that he was "very excited for what's to come", with an 'eye' emoji.

"From today I've mutually decided to part ways with the McLaren driver development programme," he said.

"I'd like to thank every individual at McLaren that has helped me develop and improve as a driver, to have my first opportunity to drive an F1 car followed by two FP1 sessions is something I'll always hold very close to my heart, I wish them all the best for the future. Thank you papaya family."

By driving at the Austrian Grand Prix, Dunne became the first Irish driver to participate in a F1 weekend in 22 years.

Dunne, who joined the team as development driver in May 2024, also took part in first practice at the Italian Grand Prix in September.

McLaren said in a statement: "It has been a pleasure to work with Alex over the last year and to contribute to his growth as a driver.

"We wish Alex all the best for his career going forward."

Dunne has won two feature races in his rookie F2 campaign, in Bahrain and Imola, but has dropped out of title contention after a number of technical infringements and collisions.

The final two rounds of the F2 season take place at the Qatar and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix on the last weekend in November and first in December.

McLaren had wanted to keep hold of Dunne beyond this season but the complication was that the seats in their F1 team are occupied by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri for the foreseeable future.

Piastri, leading the world championship with seven races to go heading into this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix, was already signed to McLaren until the end of 2026 before he signed an extended "long-term" contract with the team in March.

And Norris signed a new contract with McLaren last year that they said would keep him with the team at least until the end of 2026. And they have every intention to keep the Briton beyond that.

So there was likely to be no room for Dunne to graduate to F1 with McLaren in the forthcoming years.

On top of that, McLaren are the world champions, and it is rare for teams in a position to win races and championships to employ rookie drivers.

In talks with Dunne and his management, the team were unable to reach an agreement on his future racing programme and it was decided to release him from his contract.

Let's dive into the details: The amount of flu circulating has started to fall in England, latest data suggests.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was encouraging news heading into Christmas, but warned the virus could always bounce back in the new year.

The UKHSA uses a range of different measures to monitor flu rates, including sample testing in hospitals and in GP practices.

The latest data covers last week up to Sunday with the UKHSA concluding the virus was circulating "at medium levels".

Similar trends are being seen elsewhere in the UK. Public Health Scotland said it had seen two weeks of cases decreasing.

The fall in England comes after the agency said last week that the spread was stabilising after several weeks of rises.

This year's flu season started early, driven by a mutated strain of the virus, which prompted concern about the pressure that could be placed on hospitals.

NHS England data for the total number of people in hospital is not being published this week.

But there are signs in UKHSA's sample testing that the numbers being admitted to hospital are beginning to fall, suggesting the projections of record numbers of patients ending up in hospital with the virus over the festive period will not be realised.

Dr Jamie Lopez-Bernal, an infectious diseases expert at UKHSA, said it was "encouraging news".

But he added: "The virus is still very much with us and everyone, especially those most vulnerable to winter bugs, needs to take care to protect themselves or help not to spread these viruses to others.

"This is particularly important over Christmas as families come together to celebrate. So if you have any cold or flu-like symptoms you should try to minimise contact with others."

He said there were simple steps we can all take to protect one another when mixing indoors.

"Washing hands regularly and ensuring indoor spaces are well ventilated helps, and we advise those who have symptoms and need to go out, to consider wearing a face covering in indoor public spaces. These simple measures can help make a difference to reduce the spread.

"Flu is always unpredictable, is still circulating and could bounce back even further in the new year as we have seen in past years," he warned.

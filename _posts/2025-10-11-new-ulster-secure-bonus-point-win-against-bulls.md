Let's dive into the details: Ulsterâs Cormac Izuchukwu scored for Ulster against the Bulls

United Rugby Championship, Affidea Stadium 

Ulster 28 (7) 

Tries: McCloskey, Augustus, Herring, Izuchukwu  Cons: Doak 4 

Bulls 7 (7) 

Tries: Louw Con: Pollard 

Ulsterâs impressive start to the United Rugby Championship season continued with a bonus-point win over the Bulls in Belfast.

Stuart McCloskey's first-half try was cancelled out by Wilco Louw in an error-strewn opening period.

However, Ulster took command in the early stages of the second half.

After a yellow card to Bulls number eight Jeandre Rudolph, the hosts scored three tries in the 10 minutes he sat on the touchline.

Juarno Augustus scored on his first start for Ulster with Rob Herring and Cormac Izuchukwu also on the scoresheet, while Nathan Doak converted all four tries.

With two wins from two to begin the new season, Ulster will now make the trip to South Africa for their next two games against the Sharks and Lions on 18 and 25 October.

Jacob Stockdale had a good night at full-back

The only analysis to be done in the first half was on the number of errors by both sides, highlighted by Ulsterâs opening try.

When a Bulls pass along the backline found only empty (artificial) turf, it allowed McCloskey to kick ahead and score.

Ulsterâs maul defence was well organised, stopping the Bulls twice.

However, the visitors were guilty of wasting a number of scoring opportunities, eventually getting over the Ulster line through Springbok tight-head Wilco Louw. It came moments after Ulster hooker Rob Herring was yellow-carded for repeated infringements as the Bulls scrum began to get on top.

After holding the Bulls out in the first half, Ulster turned to attack at the start of the second 40 minutes and their early pressure led to a sin-binning for Bulls number eight Rudolph.

Never in their widest dreams, however, could Ulster have thought they would take such advantage with 21 unanswered points in the 10 minutes the South African was sitting on the sideline.

The tries from Augustus and Herring were the result of knocking at the door against a stretched defence, while Izuchukwu finished another move that began with a Bulls turnover.

Munster edge out ill-disciplined Edinburgh

A disappointing performance from the visitors - last season's beaten finalists - meant they never looked like mounting a comeback, but Ulster had put them to the sword with some direct rugby and capitalising on their man advantage.

With the Ireland squad for the November Series being named on Wednesday, it remains to be seen if two games are enough to see many of this squad named.

Jacob Stockdale was lively at full-back and he has started there for Ireland before, if only once, in October 2020 against France and with Hugo Keenan missing for the autumn, might he force his way back into the international reckoning?

Izuchukwu is another who impressed, but in the process of scoring his try he appeared to twist his knee and was quickly replaced as a precaution. Injury has robbed him before of a potential Ireland call-up. Letâs hope that isnât the case this time.

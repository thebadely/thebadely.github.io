According to new developments, The UK food watchdog has warned people with allergies not to buy imported Dubai chocolate if they have any doubts about ingredients because of different labelling standards.  

The Food Standards Agency's chief scientific advisor said shoppers should stick to "trusted" retailers in the UK as the products they sell are more likely to be made for the domestic market. 

Dubai chocolate has become hugely popular fuelled by so-called "influencers" on TikTok, leading UK supermarkets such as Waitrose and Lidl to impose per person limits to meet demand.

But a recent investigation by the BBC found several TikTok Shop users selling food without listing allergen information.

UK businesses are legally required to declare if a product they sell contains one of the 14 regulated allergens - including nuts and milk.

The FSA found some imported Dubai-style chocolate products may not have been intended for sale in the UK and therefore lack a full ingredients list or allergen labelling that are legally required.

Professor Robin May, the FSA's chief chief scientific advisor, said: "Some imported Dubai-style chocolate products don't meet our standards and could be a food safety risk, especially for consumers with allergies."

He added: "As it's difficult for consumers to tell the difference between products made for the UK and those that aren't, if you have a food allergy or intolerance, we advise that you do not buy the product unless you're certain it's intended for sale here."

By law, products made to UK standards must have labels that have the ingredients written in English, the name of the food, a best before or use by date, and the name and address of a UK or European Union (EU) business that is responsible for information on the product.

If the food is not from the EU or UK then an importer must be listed.

The FSA said it had worked with local authorities to identify a number of Dubai chocolate products that posed a health risk to consumers with allergies. 

It said some of these products may also contain additives and colours which aren't allowed to be sold in the UK.

The popular treat combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.

The regulator is now sampling products to work out the scale of the problem.

It said shoppers should report any concerns to their local authority and is working with allergy charities to raise awareness.

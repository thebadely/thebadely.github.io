Experts revealed that Ryan Naderi becomes Rangers' fourth capture of the winter window

Rangers have signed striker Ryan Naderi from German third-tier club Hansa Rostock for an undisclosed fee.

The Dresden-born 22-year-old, who has signed what the Ibrox club describe as "a long-term deal", has scored 13 goals, and contributed nine assists, in 45 appearances since joining Hansa from Borussia Monchengladbach in August 2024.

Eight of those goals, and five of the assists, have come in 18 appearances this season for a side sitting sixth in 3 Liga.

Rangers head coach Danny Rohl told his club website: "He is still young in terms of his playing career, but he has shown in Germany that he knows the way to goal as well as contributing with a number of assists due to his high level of skill.

"He is someone who has a lot of potential and I believe we can help take his game to the next level."

Now he has taken what should be a step up to the Scottish Premiership, the striker told Rangers' website: "I plan to make the most of this opportunity."

Naderi has dual German and Bulgarian citizenship through his father, while he also qualifies for the Czech Republic through his mother.

He started with local club Dynamo Dresden as a youth before joining Monchengladbach's academy, playing for their second team before his move to Hansa.

Naderi becomes Rangers' fourth signing of the January transfer window following the arrival of winger Andreas Skov Olsen on loan from Wolfsburg, midfielder Tochi Chukwuani from Sturm Graz and defender Tuur Rommens from Westerlo.

He arrives on a transfer deadline day when midfielder Joe Rothwell joined Sheffield United from Rangers on a permanent deal, while centre-half Clinton Nsiala was sent to Westerlo on a loan with an option to buy.

Here’s what you need to know: More than 60,000 greeting cards from all over the world have been delivered to a girl with cancer who wanted to break a world record on her eighth birthday.

Hundreds of motorcyclists handed the cards over to Amelia Kolpa, from Rowley Regis in the Black Country, who has neuroblastoma and has been in and out of hospital since the age of two-and-a-half.

To mark her eighth birthday on 3 March, the seven-year-old wanted to break the record for the most birthday cards received in the UK, by hitting the 8,000-card mark.

Biker Matt Lem, who helped organise the collection, said cards had been sent in from places including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and USA.

"We collected 60,000 [cards], or in excess of 60,000," he said. 

"All In the back of three vans."

Lem, who is also a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, said Amelia's appeal had "snowballed" and he was "overwhelmed" by the response.

The convoy of motorcyclists made the journey from Stourbridge on Thursday,  which was the collecting points for the cards.

 "It took us probably double the time it would usually," Lem said. "Probably about 40 minutes... 2,000 bikes.

"All she wanted was birthday cards."

Charmaine Grace, Amelia's aunt, said there had been "so much love and support" for her niece.

"It's nice to know that everyone out there is with us on this journey, and there's still humanity in the world," she said.

Grace previously said Amelia was number 60 on the list for a clinical trial, but was currently receiving palliative care.

She was "really smiley and happy," Grace said, thanking everyone for their support.

"We already had 23,000 [cards] that's in storage and thanks to Matt we got another 60," she added.

"She's going to open them and we're going to do a massive collage to put on the wall to mark that we've done her wish again. 

"We've granted another wish - so thanks everyone."

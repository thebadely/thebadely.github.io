It has been recently reported that Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn have one win each from their two fights

Conor Benn got his revenge against Chris Eubank Jr with a unanimous decision victory in their rematch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Seven months on from a thrilling first fight which recreated the rivalry between their fathers at their maiden fight 35 years ago, Benn dominated throughout the 12 rounds.

Benn took control from the first round and dominated against Eubank in a fight completely different from the back-and-forth classic in April.

But what happens next for Eubank and Benn following two major fights against each other in 2025?

What does Benn's future hold? Is Eubank about to retire? Will they meet for a third time?

BBC Sport analyses what the future holds for both.

Following his victory, Benn reiterated his intention to drop down to welterweight and take on the division's world champions.

Before the rematch he called out Rolando Romero, Mario Barrios and Brian Norman Jr, who are the holders of the WBA, WBC and WBO welterweight titles respectively.

"I fancy Barrios for the WBC world title. Ryan Garcia, Romero, Devin Haney - all of them can get it," Benn said.

Garcia has not fought since losing to Romero in May, while Haney will face Norman next Saturday for the WBO title in Riyadh.

In August Benn called out UFC fighter Ilia Topuria for a bare-knuckle fight.

Topuria, who is under contract with the UFC, would be unable to fight outside the organisation while under contract.

Despite floating the idea of a potential retirement this week, Eubank said before the fight that he will not be putting his gloves up after the rematch.

Eubank remains among the highest-ranked fighters in the middleweight division and has intentions of a world title fight.

In the build-up to the rematch, Eubank's promoter Ben Shalom said the aim was to fight Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez next.

But Shalom stressed that those hopes rested on a Eubank victory.

A fight with Alvarez would likely see Eubank jump up a weight class to super-middleweight, the weight at which the Mexican lost the IBF, WBC and WBO titles to Terence Crawford in September.

At present, there are no plans for a trilogy fight between Eubank and Benn. The contract was for two fights.

Given Eubank's ambitions at a higher weight division and Benn's long-term intentions to win titles two weight classes below middleweight, this could be a natural conclusion to their rivalry.

Benn said immediately after his victory that the rematch would be the end.

"This is the end of the Benn-Eubank saga. Over. Chris has twins coming and I have my boy, but this ends here," he said.

In his post-bout news conference, Benn added: "I think we should just let it lie now. We've done what we had to do â we sold out the stadium twice."

Asked about a potential trilogy fight, Eubank said: "Who knows? It's 1-1.

"Maybe we will see something new with me and him, or maybe we won't. Right now, it's his night."

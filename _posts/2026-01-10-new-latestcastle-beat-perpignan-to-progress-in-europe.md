Here’s what you need to know: New Newcastle signing Christian Wade has also played top level American football and rugby league

European Challenge Cup

Newcastle Red Bulls (14) 26

Tries: Wade, Arnold, Obatoyinbo, McGuigan Cons: Grayson 3

Perpignan (12) 19

Tries: Yato, Granell 2 Cons: Reus 2

Christian Wade scored his first try for Newcastle Red Bulls to help his new side qualify for the European Challenge Cup knockout stages with a thrilling victory over Perpignan at Kingston Park.

Peceli Yato powered over from close range to put the French side ahead but Newcastle hit back in style, Wade touching down after showing his pace and strength to beat three men, and Sammy Arnold rounding off a lovely move with a fine finish of his own.

Maxim Granell's try, with Newcastle temporarily down to 14 men, ensured the lead was cut to 14-12 at the break, but the hosts maintained their intensity to move into the last 16 with one game to spare.

Elliott Obatoyinbo's try in the corner, following some slick handling from the backs, and a George McGuigan score gave the home side breathing space and Newcastle held on despite a second try by Granell.

Newcastle have now won three games out of three on their European venture and can make the trip to face Welsh side Dragons in their final fixture without needing to win to progress.

A slow start put that scenario in doubt, with both sides looking nervy and guilty of some slack handling.

But the visitors settled first and led when they kept the pressure on the Newcastle defence and the brute force of Yato got him over from close range.

The sheer physicality of Perpignan threatened to overpower Newcastle but two brilliant tries in three minutes flipped the game with, first, Wade showing all his quality to hold off an initial tackle, elude two more would-be tacklers and cross near the posts.

Arnold's superb run and score after a sensational Oscar Usher offload established a 14-5 lead.

And although Perpignan scored the next try - when Ethan Grayson was yellow-carded - and the last try of the game through Granell, the home side's quality with ball in hand, the kicking of Grayson and resolute defence saw them through.

Obatoyinbo's score, after the ball was worked with pace from left to right, and McGuigan's muscular finish in the corner after a driving maul ensured Granell's second score was not enough to peg back the home side.

Newcastle boss Alan Dickens said: "It was a fantastic effort from our players, and I'm proud of them.

"Sammy Arnold's try was probably the best piece of play we've put together all season, and we fronted up physically.

"There'll be a few sore bodies because the lads threw everything into this game, and I'm really pleased that their hard work is paying off.

"There were a couple of occasions where we could have taken the game away from Perpignan, but unfortunately we couldn't get them over the line.

"Christian Wade looked sharp and took his try well. And that was a meaty French pack, but we stood up to the test."

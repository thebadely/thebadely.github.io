Let's dive into the details: Tomas Francis Louie Hennessey and Gabriel Hamer-Webb have played in the English Premiership

Wales head coach Steve Tandy has brought back prop Tomas Francis given a place to uncapped Leicester wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb and included Bath centre Louie Hennessey in his Six Nations squad.

Francis, 33, has not played international rugby since the 2023 World Cup quarter-final defeat by Argentina in Marseille.

Hamer-Webb, 25, left Cardiff for Leicester for the start of the 2025-26 season and is one of two uncapped players alongside Bath centre Hennessey, who was involved last autumn.

Returning players include Josh Macleod, Sam Costelow, James Botham, Owen Watkin, Mason Grady and Ryan Elias, while notable absentees are Rio Dyer, Tommy Reffell, Nick Tompkins and Callum Sheedy.

With flanker Jac Morgan injured, hooker Dewi Lake again captains the squad, while number eight Taulupe Faletau and centre Max Llewellyn are also injury absentees.

There are 13 English and French-based players in the 38-man squad, while there are 14 Cardiff and Ospreys involved at a time where there are suggestions the two sides could merge.

Wales have struggled to fill the tight-head prop void left by Francis, who has played 77 internationals, won Six Nations titles in 2019 and 2021, and featured in the World Cups of 2015, 2019 and 2023.

After leaving Ospreys in 2023, Francis will arrive at Sale Sharks from the French second division team Provence for the start of the 2026-27 season.

Francis, who will aim to play in a fourth World Cup next year in Australia, is one of three tight-head props that include Keiron Assiratti and Archie Griffin.

Former Bath wing Hamer-Webb played age-grade rugby for England, but qualifies for Wales through his mother.

He impressed for Cardiff but is currently not a regular starter with Leicester.

The Wales squad will link up next week before the Six Nations opener away against England on Saturday, 7 February.

Wales have lost their previous 11 matches in the tournament with the past victory coming against Italy in March 2023.

"There are a few changes to the squad from the autumn, some due to injury, but others are a sign of the competition there is and how many players we have in the mix which is a real positive," said Tandy.

"I think we have a good blend again within the squad moving into this campaign and can't wait for us to assemble next week.

"I'm excited to get back into camp and look at how we build on the foundations established in the autumn and make sure we are continually growing and developing as a group."

Tandy has backed Lake to lead the side again.

"Dewi is great man and so passionate about Wales which I think everyone can see," added Tandy.

"I thought he was outstanding in the way he led during the autumn, not only in the three games he was captain, but also how he supported Jac [Morgan] prior to that. 

"I know he will continue to do an amazing job in the role this Six Nations."

According to new developments, Manchester United only needed a point against Manchester City to qualify for Europe

Melvine Malard celebrated her equaliser like it was a stoppage-time winner and the Old Trafford crowd gave an outpouring of adulation. It reflected the significance of this result for Manchester United.

Not only did they come from 2-0 down - and with 10 players after Aoife Mannion was sent off - to secure a point against bitter rivals Manchester City, it confirmed Champions League football for next season.

Four points clear with one game left, United ended City's own hopes of playing in Europe.

Marc Skinner's side can now prepare for a new future, looking at unique recruitment strategies and eyeing up financial gains, while City will assess where it all went wrong. 

Simply put, the 2-2 draw on Sunday was really a victory for United. 

"To go 2-0 down, then come back, then go down to 10 players and then to see the game out... it absolutely feels like a win," said manager Skinner. 

"It obviously secured Champions League football so it is a huge moment for this young team. They haven't faced many moments like that. To do it, is very special."

Man Utd comeback against Man City seals Europe spot

Man City 'fall short of standards' to miss out on Europe

What's gone wrong for Man City in trophyless season?

Manchester United will compete in a third successive FA Cup final this month

United have been in this position before in 2023, when they secured a Champions League spot, but failed to progress from the qualifying rounds a few months later.

Women's Super League champions Chelsea will go straight into the group phase of the competition next season, while second and third place go into the qualification rounds, meaning United will still have to navigate that.

But they want to go one step further and will attempt to attract the biggest names in Europe to compete in the competition. 

Financially, there are rewards. Reaching the group stages of the Women's Champions League means they would receive just over Â£430,000 as a starting fee and bonus payments on top, depending on results.

"It's huge. The next step is that we have to recruit the right way," added Skinner.

"In order to go into the depths of the Champions League - and from our perspective actually qualify for the group stages - we have to add the quality of depth. 

"Champions League gives you that. People want to come to a Champions League team. Hopefully it opens that market for us."

European football also gives United an elevated status in the women's game. 

They no longer need to rely on the brand of Manchester United as a club - but the success of their performances as a team.

It is also a boost in their efforts to convince United co-owner, Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his staff that the women's team are worth investing in. 

Skinner added: "The club has a big status but the women's team has a young status. We qualified [for Europe] two seasons ago but now we have done it again and that does give us a big status.

"When we have recruitment calls, it's always about whether we get to the Champions League - that is what the agents are saying. 

"That status opens up more doors to give us better conversations."

While United are planning for bigger things, they must prepare well for the crucial transfer window Skinner has constantly referred to.

When they last got into Europe, United signed World Cup Golden Boot winner Hinata Miyazawa, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Brazilian winger Geyse.

But American Tullis-Joyce did not break into the first team until this season, alongside Miyazawa consistently, while Geyse is now on loan at Gotham FC. 

They needed more physicality and experience, said Skinner, but the challenge this time around is to recruit players who can make an instant difference.

"I have not stopped all year to be honest in terms of our recruitment. We haven't just waited," said Skinner.

"We have that moment now to reflect - but it will be a big summer for us, for sure."

How will United make sure it's a successful window?

The club are developing their own analysis system which looks at data and statistics to help them talent spot the players who are right for them. 

Technical director Jason Wilcox and women's head of recruitment Harvey Bussell are working together to lead the task.

"It's becoming much more robust. It's still in its infancy, but that's, I think, the strategy route we will go down," added Skinner.

"We've spoken as a team, we get Champions League, then we have to look at the budget and how we progress in the market. 

"We're in a competitive market. So I've got to try to find, with my expertise, how I can make a player better.

 "Those are the little details that we'll have to work through."

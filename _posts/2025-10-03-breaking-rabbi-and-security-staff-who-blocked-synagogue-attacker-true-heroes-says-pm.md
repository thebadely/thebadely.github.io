According to new developments, A rabbi and security guards from a Manchester synagogue have been praised as "heroes" by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for their actions when the building came under attack.

Two members of the Jewish community were killed and four were left in a serious condition in the attack during worship to mark Yom Kippur at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in the north of the city. 

Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson confirmed worshippers and security staff helped stop the attacker getting inside before he was shot dead by officers.

Sir Keir said there was no doubt emergency services and the synagogue's security guards "prevented an even greater tragedy".

The attacker was wearing a suspected explosive device, which GMP have said was not viable, when he drove a car at crowds before stabbing a number of people.

A witness at the scene said prayers had started when the attack happened but Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading the service, remained calm and he and others led the congregation to safety.

He added: "They are true heroes."

Sir Stephen said there were many worshippers inside the synagogue at the time of the incident.

He praised security staff and worshippers who shut the attacker out, saying that thanks to the "immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside, as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access". 

"All those inside were safely contained until police were able to confirm that it was safe to leave the premises."

Giving a statement from the scene, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said: "Tonight, our first thoughts are with the families of those people who died, those injured and those traumatised by this, an horrific antisemitic attack on our Jewish friends and neighbours. We condemn it outright.

"Greater Manchester will never stand aside when one of our communities is attacked."

A major incident was declared at about 09.37 BST after police received a call from a man who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and a male security guard from had been stabbed.

The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man described as being of Syrian descent, was shot dead outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, at about 09:40 BST.

It is understood that he entered the UK as a very young child, and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.

GMP said three people had been arrested - two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s - as part of the investigation into what has been declared a "terrorist incident" by police.

Rob Kanter, a university teacher who was inside the synagogue, said worshippers continued their service after being evacuated. 

He said the congregation were moved by police first into the rear hall of the building, then to a nearby centre, adding he did not fear for his safety.

He said "everyone was calm and dignified" and people "used an element of humour" to keep going.

The attacker was shot dead within seven minutes of the initial call to police.

A delivery driver, Gareth, who saw the incident told BBC Radio Manchester he saw a man outside the synagogue holding a knife. 

He said: "Within seconds, the police arrived, they gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire." 

The man then "started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again", Gareth said - describing it as "nerve-racking" to see.

Another witness, Chava Lewin, who lives near the synagogue, said when the suspect got out of the car he "started stabbing anyone near him" after the vehicle crashed into the synagogue gates. 

After the attack, police said a loud explosion could be heard as "specialist resources gained entry to the suspect's vehicle as a precaution".

In his statement, Starmer said: "Britain is also a country where Jewish buildings, synagogues, even schools require round the clock protection, where dedicated specialist security is necessary because of the daily threat of antisemitic hatred.

"Today's horrific incident shows why. And while this is not a new hate, this is something Jews have always lived with, we must be clear, it is a hatred that is rising once again, and Britain must defeat it once again.

The prime minister said: "To every Jewish person in this country, I also want to say this. I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do.

"And so on behalf of our country, I express my solidarity, but also my sadness that you still have to live with these fears. Nobody should have to do that. Nobody.

"And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community."

Counter-terrorism policing Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said police forces across the UK were stepping up patrols at synagogues and Jewish sites to provide reassurance "to all those communities that have been affected by this incident". 

Forces were deploying "all of our capabilities in response to what has happened" and were working closely with security services to ensure we have a "full intelligence picture", he added. 

The attack was carried out on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, when work is forbidden and worshippers gather to pray.

It is also a day when many who do not regularly attend synagogue services do so, and as a result security is often increased.

Some Jewish people do not access social media or television during this holy day, meaning many may not yet have heard about the attack. 

Burnham confirmed that volunteers from the Community Security Trust, a charity that monitors antisemitism in the UK, were at the scene during the attack. 

The CST said it is working closely with police in Manchester to ensure security at synagogues is "as strong as it can be".

The trust paid tribute to the security guards at the synagogue and the police officers who responded. 

CST urged everyone attending synagogues or any other Jewish premises to follow all instructions from security guards and police officers. 

"In particular, we urge people not to congregate outside communal premises and synagogues to keep their doors closed at all times", they said. 

"This kind of attack is the reason why we have such extensive security in place across the Jewish community."

In response to the attack, the Manchester Council of Mosques said it was "shocked and saddened", adding "our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community at this distressing time". 

In a statement, it said: "Manchester has always been a city where people of all faiths and backgrounds live side by side. 

"Any attempt to divide us through violence or hatred will fail - we remain united in our commitment to peace and mutual respect."

The council has urged people to remain calm and called on the city to "stand together as one Manchester, united against hatred".

Burnham has said he plans to reassure Jewish communities who have been living in a "higher state of anxiety" after rising incidents of antisemitism.

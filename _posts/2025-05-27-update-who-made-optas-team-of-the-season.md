Let's dive into the details: Statisticians Opta have come up with a Premier League team of the season based on data collected during the course of the campaign.

Check out their XI below - and you can see Troy Deeney's team of the year here, too, with eight players the same.

Four of Liverpool's title winners made Opta's team of the year

Matz Sels won his first Golden Glove with 13 clean sheets

Nottingham Forest qualified for European football for the first time since the 1995-96 campaign and a significant reason for that was the performance of their defence. 

Goalkeeper Sels only kept one clean sheet in 16 games in 23-24 but this season he's been had 13, the joint most by a Forest goalkeeper in a Premier League season, level with Mark Crossley in 94-95. 

He also shared the accolade of the Premier League's Golden Glove award - the only other goalkeeper who could match his 13 clean sheets was Arsenal's David Raya.

Sels made 120 saves - with only three goalkeepers making more - and enjoyed a save percentage of 72.1%, behind only Jordan Pickford among ever-present goalkeepers in 24-25. He also prevented 4.3 goals according to Opta's xGoT (expected goals on target) goalkeeping model.

In his final season at Liverpool before a likely move to Real Madrid, Alexander-Arnold signed off as a Premier League champion. He contributed to nine of Liverpool's 86 goals in 24-25 (three goals, six assists), with only two defenders involved in more over the course of the season.

His exceptional passing ability was once again on show across the season. Among defenders, he ranked in the top three for each of: 

passes in the final third (673, 2nd)

line-breaking passes in the final third (232, second)

passes into the box (239, first)

chances created (53, 3rd)

big chances created (15, joint first), expected assists (7.4, first)

expected assists in open play (6.2, first)

It was another second-place finish for Arsenal - their third in a row since Saliba's debut in August 2022 - but yet again it was a superb individual season for the France centre-back. 

Only three central defenders kept more clean sheets than Saliba (12), while the Gunners conceded one goal for every 113 minutes he was the pitch, the best ratio of any central defender in the Premier League.

Saliba was also second across all players for successful passes with 2,409 and he completed an incredible 94.6% of his pass attempts, the third best ratio on record by a player to attempt at least 2,000 in a season since 03-04 and the best by an Arsenal player in a single season in that time. 

The recent 1-0 win over Newcastle was also Saliba's 100th Premier League game and his 68th victory, equalling the record for wins in a player's first 100 Arsenal games and going level with Sol Campbell and Lauren.

Van Dijk was so close to becoming the first player in Premier League history to play every single minute of two different title-winning seasons until he was given a rest for the 3-2 defeat to Brighton on 19 May.

For a fourth consecutive season, the Dutchman completed the most passes of any Liverpool player in the Premier League, while this season he ranked top league-wide with 2,680. 

He remains incredibly effective in duels, winning 68.7% this season, ranking him top among players to contest at least 250, while aerially he also ranked first for percentage of aerial duels won, winning 119 out of 165 (72%).

Although it was trophyless season for Manchester City, the performances of Gvardiol were one bright spark. 

Gvardiol ended the season as the joint-highest scoring defender with five goals, while only Steve Howey in 00-01 (six) has ever scored more among defenders for City in a Premier League season.

Gvardiol was key in moving City into attacking areas, ranking second among defenders for both ball-carry distance (7,462 metres) and ball carry progress (4,215 metres). He also made 717 successful passes in the final third and 263 line-breaking passes in the final third - the most of any defender this season.

Operating in a deeper lying role under manager Arne Slot, Gravenberch enjoyed a superb season and was an integral part of Liverpool's 24-25 title win, starting 37 of 38 games and featuring in all 25 victories.

The Dutchman led all midfielders for interceptions (60), with his tally last bettered by a Liverpool midfielder in 15-16 (Emre Can, 62). 

He won possession back for his side on 193 occasions - the joint fourth best of any defensive midfielder in 24-25 - while in possession he completed the third-most passes of any midfielder (1,704) and made the most progressive carries of 10 or more metres of any defensive midfielder (118). 

Only Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard had more Premier League assists for Arsenal this season than Rice (seven), while his 59 chances created and 16 big chances created are his best personal totals in a league campaign. 

Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces is no secret and nor is Rice's role in it - he created 26 chances from set plays, with only three players creating more, while his expected assists figure from set plays led the way among all players (3.2). 

The England midfielder was also key in moving Arsenal upfield. He progressed the ball 2,740 metres with ball carries, the most of any Gunners player and third-most of any central midfielder.

With 20 goals and seven assists, Mbeumo enjoyed a superb individual campaign, breaking the record for goals and assists combined by a Brentford player in a Premier League season. Only once did he go three appearances in a row without scoring or assisting.

The Cameroon forward created 70 chances, also a record by a Bees player in one season, while it is a total that only four players bettered in 24-25, and his expected assists total of 9.3 was the joint best of any player. 

Mbeumo was also deadly in front of goal, finding the net with 23.5% of his shots (20/85), the best figure of any player to attempt at least 70 shots. He exceeded his expected goal (xG) total by more than seven goals (20 goals, 12.3 xG), the best overperformance in the entire division.

He continued his excellent record in London derbies, too. Mbeumo scored against all six opponents (Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham) to become the first player in Premier League history to score against six different teams in London derbies in one campaign.

Matheus Cunha looks set to leave Wolves in the summer transfer window

Cunha's outstanding performances for Wolves this season have put him on the verge of a move to Manchester United. 

Despite Wolves not once entering the top half all season, the Brazilian contributed to 15 goals and six assists which helped them move clear of relegation. Only Raul Jimenez in 19-20 (17 goals, six assists) has ever been involved in more goals in a Premier League campaign for Wolves.

Cunha is the first player since Charlie Austin in 14-15 for Queen's Park Rangers to get 20 or more goals and assists in a season where they never played a minute in the top half of the table. 

Among players to play 2,500 minutes in the Premier League this season, Cunha ranked top - per 90 minutes - for shots attempted (3.8), third for shots on target (1.5) and second for fouls won (2.5).

Of his 15 Premier League goals - a joint record by a Brazilian player - five of them were from outside the box, the joint most of any player in 24-25 along with Bruno Fernandes, someone who may be his teammate come the start of next season.

The records have tumbled for Isak in 24-25. Isak began the season on 31 goals but ended it with 54 and in the process became the leading Swedish Premier League scorer, overtaking Freddie Ljungberg's total of 48 with a double against Nottingham Forest in February.

In that same game, Isak's two goals took him to 50 in just 76 appearances, the fastest any Newcastle player has reached 50 Premier League goals, breaking Alan Shearer's record of 87.

The Sweden forward also achieved something else Shearer never managed - scoring in eight consecutive Premier League appearances, doing so between 4 December and 15 January.

Isak was just the fourth player to achieve that feat after Ruud van Nistelrooy, Daniel Sturridge and Jamie Vardy. In December, Isak scored eight goals - more than seven clubs managed that month - and won the Player of the Month.

Isak ended the season on 23 Premier League goals, the most by a Magpies player since Shearer's 23 in 01-02, and only Mohamed Salah scored more in 24-25. 

He needed just 46 shots on target to score those 23, with that the second-best conversion rate (50%) from shots on target of any Newcastle player to have 25 or more shots in a season since 03-04. 

Mohamed Salah has won two Premier League titles with Liverpool

Possibly the easiest choice of all time for a player's inclusion in a statistical team of the season, Salah enjoyed one of the finest individual seasons in Premier League history. Many of his astonishing records from 24-25 may not be beaten for many years.

The Egyptian was involved in 47 Premier League goals (29 goals, 18 assists), a record in a 38-game campaign to overtake the 44 goal and assist seasons of Thierry Henry in 2002-03 and Erling Haaland in 2022-23. 

Including 42-game seasons, Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer had 34 goals and 13 assists in 93-94 and 94-95 respectively, which Salah matched with his equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day.

With these goals and assists totals, it's little surprise that Salah topped the charts outright for both metrics in 24-25, only the third time a player has achieved that, along with Cole in 93-94 and Harry Kane in 20-21. 

Salah scored and assisted in 11 different Premier League games this season, four more than any other player has done so in a season. Across Europe's big five leagues, it was the most since Lionel Messi did so 11 times in 14-15 for Barcelona.

Sixteen of Salah's 29 Premier League goals were scored away from home, a joint record, while he also added 11 away assists, again a joint record. 

Salah's 27 is the most goals and assists combined away from home in one season. 

Although Salah did not beat topple the all-time assist record in a season of 20, all 18 of his assists came from open play - that's the second most behind Thierry Henry in 02-03 (20). 

Salah was also the Premier League's most creative player in open play, making 86 chances and most big chances (27) for his team-mates. Salah had the most shots (130), registered the best xG (25.4) and had the most touches in the opposition box (394).

Let's dive into the details: The UK rate of inflation rose by 3.5% in the year to April, a much bigger increase than expected.

The jump was mostly fuelled by rises in household bills such as gas, electricity and, in particular, water.

The minimum wage and some benefits were increased last month, but for many it does not cover their day-to-day costs.   

People have contacted the BBC through Your Voice, Your BBC News or spoken to us about the rising cost of living and how they are dealing with it.

Tracy McGuigan-Haigh, 47, told the BBC that the cost of everyday items has simply "gone too far". 

Tracy has a job in retail which she fits around looking after her 11-year-old daughter. She earns £1,200 a month and receives around £400 a month in Universal Credit payments - but this isn't stretching far enough.

"Even on a budget, the supermarket shop is getting more and more expensive," she said. "Before, I'd have needed a trolley for £40 worth of food. Now, it doesn't even fill a basket, you can carry that much in your arms."

Dealing with rising prices is a constant struggle. "I've juggled so much that I've dropped balls," said Tracy.

"Somebody's going 'it'll get better' but even if it does improve now, what's the support for the people who are down there, who are on the floor?"

Ieuan Hood, a single father of three, is meticulous when it comes to his finances - he knows where every penny is going.

The 30-year-old, who works full-time at a call centre near Huddersfield, said that he receives universal credit on top of his wage. His benefit payments rose by 1.7% last month but that has been wiped out by higher bills.

"It is almost as if it hasn't happened," he told the BBC.

Ieuan said that his monthly wage is roughly £1,600. Universal credit bumps that up to £2,500 and he gets a further £240 for child benefit.

"Saying it out loud it sounds like a lot of money," he said. "But the first bill that I pay every month is my childcare bill which is £1,700.

"Rent is then £500, food shopping will be around £700, transport is £150. I also have water bills, energy bills, TV, phone and council tax. 

He said: "By the time it's finished there are some months when I'm looking at it and I have nothing left."

Peter Murphy, aged 80 from Stockport, has a small teachers' pension, a state pension and his main BT pension, giving him a combined income of about £25,000 a year.

The rising cost of living means he and his wife have cut back on foreign holidays.

Peter told Your Voice, Your BBC News that inflation "leaves me poorer every year" because his pension isn't rising as fast as his bills.

"There's only so much I can spend," he says.

"My teacher's pension and BT pension rose by 1.8% in April. My BT broadband contract went up by 3% plus inflation at a higher rate, as did my mobile contract and all my other contracted services. Plus the level of service, like roaming was cut.

"Rates and some foods I can understand."

He says regulators like Ofcom "have the power to stop these recent practices, but don't".

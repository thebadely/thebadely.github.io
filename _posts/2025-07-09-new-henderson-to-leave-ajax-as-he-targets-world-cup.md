It has been recently reported that Jordan Henderson has made 84 appearances for England and scored three goals 

Jordan Henderson is leaving Ajax and is weighing up his next move with next year's World Cup in mind.

The England international joined the Dutch giants in January 2024 and has made more than 50 appearances in the Netherlands.

But Henderson's contract at the Amsterdam Arena has expired and he will now start exploring a move elsewhere.

The midfielder, 35, is understood to have interest from clubs in England and top leagues in Europe.

The former Liverpool captain has been back on Merseyside in recent days to mourn the death of former team-mate Diogo Jota, who was killed last week in a car accident.

Henderson lifted the Premier League - the club's first league title in 30 years - Champions League, FA Cup, two League Cups, Fifa Club World Cup, Uefa Super Cup and the Community Shield during his 12 years at Anfield, before joining Al-Ettifaq on a three-year deal in July 2024. 

However, his time in the Saudi Pro League lasted less than six months and his contract was cancelled so he could join Ajax on a two and a half-year deal. 

Henderson has featured in both full England squads since Thomas Tuchel's appointment as head coach in January.

He made his England debut in a friendly against France in November 2010 at the age of 20, and he was called up to the Euro 2012 squad to replace the inured Frank Lampard. 

He has made 84 appearances for the national side and scored three goals, featuring in England's previous three World Cups squads in Brazil, Russia and Qatar. 

After being left out of the preliminary Euro 2024 squad - as he had not played for England since 2023 - he made his return earlier this year in games against Albania and Latvia.

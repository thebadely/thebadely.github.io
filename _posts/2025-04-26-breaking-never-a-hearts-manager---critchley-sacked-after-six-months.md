Hearts v Dundee highlights

26/04/25

Neil Critchley has been sacked as Hearts head coach just six months after his appointment following Saturday's 1-0 home loss to Dundee.

The former Blackpool boss was brought to Tynecastle in October with the club rooted to the bottom of the Scottish Premiership.

The 46-year-old has steered Hearts 11 points clear of the foot of the table but faced criticism for failing to lead the team into the league's top six.

There was further disappointment last weekend, with a Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Aberdeen.

In his 35 matches in charge across all competitions, Critchley won 14 and lost 14 but was adamant after the Dundee defeat that he could turn the situation around.

"I understand the frustration when we don't score at home and get beat," he told BBC Scotland. "I'm comfortable with [the expectation]. 

"I believe that I'm the man to get us out of this situation and move the club forward in the future."

Having gone four league games without scoring, the Edinburgh side are now eighth, five points above the relegation play-off spot with four games remaining.

Critchley's assistant Mike Garrity also departs, with coach Liam Fox taking control on an interim basis.

Former Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart on Sportscene

"The club have panicked. They are clearly concerned about being dragged into the relegation play-off spot. 

"I'm not surprised. I've got a great deal of sympathy for Neil Critchley. He's a nice guy and clearly knows a lot about football, but he was never a Hearts manager. 

"That's a bigger issue for me - who's making these appointments. Critchley was the seventh appointment since Ann Budge took the club out of administration and the track record has not been great.

"When Neil Critchley's name was mooted, I don't think a single person associated with Hearts thought 'oh, that's a good appointment'. 

"With this one, the board basically absolved themselves of any responsibility for it and handed the decision over to Jamestown Analytics. You cannot just take a step back and give full responsibility to someone else.

"Jamestown Analytics was heralded as the tool that could have Hearts challenge for the title but they've not been able to get a manager who could last a season and that undermines it.

"I don't think it's rocket science. Far too often, it feels like they are trying to be too smart and do things differently rather than just doing football things properly. 

"Hearts are arguably the third biggest club in the country and should be challenging every season. But they're bottom six and not maximising what they've got."

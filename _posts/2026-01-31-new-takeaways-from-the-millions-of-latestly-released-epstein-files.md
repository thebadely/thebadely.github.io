Let's dive into the details: Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been released by the US Department of Justice, the largest number of documents shared by the government since a law mandated their release last year. 

Three million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos were posted publicly on Friday.

The release came six weeks after the department missed a deadline signed into law by US President Donald Trump that mandated all Epstein-related documents be shared with the public. 

"Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance," Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said.

The files include details about Jeffrey Epstein's time in prison - including a psychological report - and his death while incarcerated, along with investigative records on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate who was convicted of helping him traffic underaged girls. 

They also include emails between Epstein and high-profile figures.

Many of the emails and documents go back more than a decade, showcasing Epstein's relationships amid his legal troubles. He was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl after coming to a controversial plea agreement with prosecutors. 

He died in August 2019 while in jail on charges in a sprawling sex trafficking case. 

The documents shed light on the disgraced financier's close association with Britain's elite.

They include emails between Epstein and a person named "The Duke" - believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - discussing having dinner at Buckingham Palace, where there was "lots of privacy". 

Another message from Epstein includes an offer to introduce "The Duke" to a 26-year-old Russian woman.

The emails are signed "A", with a signature that appears to read "HRH Duke of York KG". They were exchanged in August 2010, two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.

The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing.

The BBC has contacted Andrew, formerly known as the Duke of York, for a response. Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Some emails in the latest release appear to be between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, Andrew's ex-wife. 

One email dated 4 April 2009, was signed "Love, Sarah, The red Head.!!"

It says that she was going to be in Palm Beach and wanted to have tea. The email goes on to discuss ideas for Ferguson's company, Mother's Army. The former Duchess of York refers to Epstein as "My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey".

She calls him a "legend" and says "I am so proud of you".

The financier was still under house arrest for his 2008 conviction when the email exchange was sent.

Other emails show Epstein sent £10,000 ($13,692) to Lord Peter Mandelson's husband Reinaldo Avila da Silva in 2009. 

In an email to Epstein, da Silva sets out the costs of an osteopathy course, provides his bank details and thanks the financier for "anything you can help me with".

Epstein replies a few hours later saying he would wire the loan amount and da Silva, who married Mandelson in 2023, replies with a thank you the following day. 

In another batch of emails, Lord Mandelson asks to stay at one of Epstein's properties.

The emails are from 16 June 2009, when Epstein was serving a prison sentence for soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. For much of his sentence, Epstein was allowed to work from his office during the day and returned to jail each night.

In December 2024, Lord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador to the US, but was sacked less than a year later when it emerged he had sent supportive messages to Epstein following the conviction.

Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his past friendship with Epstein, which has long been public knowledge. He has said he never saw any wrongdoing while with Epstein and "fell for his lies".

The US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files. Trump had a friendship with Epstein but he says it soured many years ago and has denied any knowledge of his sex crimes.

Among the new documents is a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.

The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.

Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.

When asked about the latest allegations, both the White House and justice department pointed to a line in a news release accompanying the new batch of files.

"Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election," the US Justice Department said. 

"To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already." 

The documents also include email correspondence between Epsteing and tech billionaire Elon Musk. 

Musk, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case, has previously said that Epstein had invited him to his island but he had declined. 

The new emails show Musk had discussed travelling there on more than one occasion - including a proposed 2012 trip - in which he asked Epstein: "What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?" 

The emails from November 2012 show Epstein asked how many people Musk would need transported on a helicopter to the island and Musk replies that he it would only be himself and his then-wife, Talulah Riley.

An email from Musk to Epstein on Christmas in 2012 includes Musk inquiring whether the financier has any parties planned because he needs to "let loose". 

"I've been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose," he writes, adding that a "peaceful island experience" is the opposite of what he's wanting. 

In another batch of emails from the end of 2013, Musk and Epstein discuss a visit to the financier's island and are working on logistics and dates. 

There is no evidence that Musk ever did end up taking a trip to Epstein's island.

The BBC has contacted representatives for Musk at his companies about the new emails. 

A spokesperson for Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has responded to lurid allegations contained in the latest Epstein files – including that he caught a sexually-transmitted disease – calling them "absolutely absurd and completely false".

Two emails from 18 July 2013 appear to have been drafted by Epstein but it is unclear if they were ever sent to Gates. Both were sent from Epstein's email account and back to the same account, while no email account associated with Gates is visible and both emails are unsigned.

One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates "to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls".

The other, which begins "dear Bill", complains about Gates having ended a friendship and makes more claims about Gates having tried to cover up a sexually transmitted infection, including from his then-wife, Melinda.

A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: "These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false."

They added: "The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame."

It is uncertain if this is end of the road for the Epstein documents release saga. 

Deputy Attorney General Blanche said Friday's drop "marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process" signalling that as far as the US justice department is concerned, it's job over.

However, Democrats continue to argue that the department has withheld too many documents – possibly around two-and-a-half million – without proper justification.

Democratic Congressman Roh Khanna, who spearheaded the Epstein Files Transparency Act alongside Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he's wary.

"The DOJ said it identified over 6 million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions," he said.

"This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld. I will be reviewing closely to see if they release what I've been pushing for."

The Department of Justice had been under heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law in November.

Many of the documents released on Friday include heavy redactions. The law mandates that redactions can only be made to protect victims or information currently under investigation. It also mandates a summary of the redactions made and the legal basis for them.

Blanche said the redactions aimed to protect victims and the department had hundreds of employees combing through the documents for more than two months to ensure they were released quickly. 

But still, whether this saga is over remains to be seen. 

Many - including within Trump's base - have long believed there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful who were connected to Epstein. 

Blanche acknowledged the release of these documents would not satisfy that need for more information. He said the files don't contain the names of specific men who abused women and that, if the department had those names, the men would be prosecuted.

"I don't think that the public or you all are going to uncover men within the Epstein files that abused women, unfortunately."

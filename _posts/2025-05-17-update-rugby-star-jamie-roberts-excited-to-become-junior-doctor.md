It has been recently reported that Former Wales rugby international Jamie Roberts says he is "ready" and "excited" to become a junior doctor and complete his medical training in the NHS.

Twelve years after graduating from Cardiff University's school of medicine, the former British and Irish Lion will begin two years of foundation training in hospitals in south Wales.

Roberts won 94 caps for Wales and was the British and Irish Lions' Player of the Series following their tour of South Africa in 2009, before being selected again for the Australia tour in 2013.

The 38-year-old said rugby had given him "some of the best experiences" of his life and he was "looking forward to the same in a medical career".

Roberts made his debut for Wales against Scotland in 2008, while he was a medical student.

"I always wanted to play rugby. It was a passion of mine," Roberts told BBC News.

"I loved the sport, I still do and it will stay with me forever. But I was a problem-solver at school. 

"I love maths and I love science and I love people, I guess. And medicine was the perfect fit and ticked a lot of boxes for me."

In the UK, medical training involves an undergraduate degree which usually takes five years to complete, followed by a two-year foundation programme when trainees become junior doctors and are paid a salary.

It took Roberts seven years to complete his undergraduate degree because of his commitments with Wales, the Lions and Cardiff Blues. 

"I reflect on it now and I wonder how on earth I did that. You know, the enthusiasm of youth helps. I was very busy. I was very driven," he said.

He sat his final undergraduate exams in 2013 - the same week that he was part of a Wales side which won the Six Nations after defeating England by 30-3 - and graduated a few months later.

"You know, we won the tournament here [in Cardiff], and then a month or two later - having sat my medical finals in that Wales v England week - I got my exam results," he recalled.

"I guess it was the culmination of a lot of hard work over both disciplines."

After graduating, Roberts spent the next decade focused on his rugby career, playing at centre for several clubs including Racing Metro, Harlequins, Bath, Dragons and Waratahs. 

But academia continued to give the aspiring doctor the escape from rugby he said he "craved", and he completed postgraduate degrees at both Loughborough University and Cambridge University.

He became a father in 2021, before retiring from rugby the following year.

"When you finish playing rugby, you know, when people ask you what you're doing it's sometimes challenging when you can't really answer that question and you're doing random bits and bobs," he said.

In November 2023, Roberts passed a "return to medicine" exam which allowed him to resume his medical training. 

So, in which field does he hope to specialise?

"I was obviously very interested in my own injuries. I had quite a few big ones," he said. 

"Reconstructive surgery to quite a few of my joints, a fractured skull as well. 

"Whether I can foresee a future in sports medicine, or orthopaedics, that's what I'm naturally leaning towards."

Roberts follows in the footsteps of several other Wales internationals who turned their hands to medicine, including Dr Jack Matthews, orthopaedic surgeon JPR Williams, former captain Dr Gwyn Jones and, more recently, Hallam Amos.

"I've a massive amount of respect for everyone who works for the NHS," said Roberts.

"I've no doubt it's challenging at times and I've no doubt I'm going to feel that, but again that's the challenge isn't it. It rewards you in many different ways, so I'm looking forward to it."

As one of the most familiar faces in Welsh sport, Roberts said being recognised by patients was "always great." 

"People love rugby in Wales. As a student that had its rewards for me - it's a great way of connecting with people and again, I'm excited by that."

Reflecting on his sporting career, Roberts added: "I gave the game everything I had and it roared at me in such amazing ways. 

"It's given me some of the best experiences of my life and I'm looking forward to the same in a medical career."

Experts revealed that Draper and Jessica Pegula defeated Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz in the first round of the US Open mixed doubles event in August

British number ones Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu could partner each other in mixed doubles after agreeing to play at next year's United Cup in Australia.

Great Britain, Poland and Australia are the first three teams to be confirmed for the mixed-team event, which will take place in Perth and Sydney from 2 to 11 January the week before the Australian Open.

Draper pulled out of the 2025 event with injury before Britain exited at the quarter-finals, while 2026 will be Raducanu's United Cup debut.

"To see British [number ones] in Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu line up for the first time will bring new star power to the tournament," said United Cup director Stephen Farrow.

Eighteen teams - each featuring up to three male and three female players - will be split into six groups of three, with teams playing those in their groups in a round robin format.

Each tie will comprise one men's singles and one women's singles match featuring the number one-ranked singles players, and one mixed doubles match.

Draper and Raducanu could partner in the doubles, though it is likely team organisers will select two doubles specialists for the squad.

Ranking points will be on offer and could prove crucial as Raducanu, the current world number 29, tries to qualify as one of the 32 seeds for the Australian Open.

"I'm honoured to be able to make my United Cup debut in January," Raducanu said.

"Being able to play for Team GB with my team-mates is a unique opportunity and week to enjoy.

"It's great to be able to experience a new format on the tour, represent my country and spend a couple extra weeks in Australia."

Poland have confirmed the participation of world number two Iga Swiatek and Hubert Hurkacz, while world number six Alex de Minaur and Maya Joint will represent Australia.

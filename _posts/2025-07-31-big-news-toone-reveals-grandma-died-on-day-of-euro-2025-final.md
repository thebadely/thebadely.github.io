It has been recently reported that Ella Toone made her Lionesses debut in 2021 and has scored 23 goals in 65 appearances

England's Ella Toone has revealed her grandmother passed away on the morning of the Euro 2025 final.

It was a game the 25-year-old started as the Lionesses beat Spain in a penalty shootout in Basel to retain their title.

In an Instagram post on Thursday, Toone reflected on the sad news as she paid tribute to her "football loving, crazy, funny Nana Maz".

She previously revealed her grandmother had put a bet on her - then aged six - that Toone would grow up to play for England.

"Even in the highest of highs, life can hit you with the lowest of lows," said the Manchester United midfielder, whose father died last September just days before his 60th birthday.

"I have comfort in knowing she got to watch from the best seat in the house with Dad, her favourite person.

"I'll miss you forever nan but I'll cherish the special memories we made. There isn't enough words I can possibly say to sum up the person you were, but I'm grateful you were my nanna.

"All those years ago when you put a bet on at the bookies that I would play for England one day and on the day you leave us, we bring it home again. You always knew it."

Her father Nick was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after her daughter scored for the Lionesses against Germany in their Euro 2022 final success at Wembley.

Toone said she did not "actually grieve" until a period on the sidelines through injury two months after his death - and lost her love for the game.

She made six appearances for England at the Euros in Switzerland, scoring against the Netherlands and Wales in the group stage.

Toone played 87 minutes of the final against world champions Spain before being replaced by Beth Mead.

England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton also lost her grandfather two days before the final, and she saved two penalties in the shootout following a 1-1 draw to help her side defend the title they won in 2022.

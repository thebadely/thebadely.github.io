It has been recently reported that Stuart Broad took 604 Test wickets for England between 2007 and 2023

Former England bowler Stuart Broad believes Australia have their "worst" team since 2010 heading into this winter's Ashes.

Broad was responding to ex-Australia batter David Warner's prediction England would lose the series down under 4-0.

England's last triumph in Australia was in 2010-2011, when Broad was part of a squad which won 3-1 to retain the urn.

However, they have suffered heavy defeats of 5-0, 4-0  and 4-0 in their three trips to Australia since.

"It's very, very difficult to win in Australia as an England side, or any side - it just is," Broad told the For the Love of Cricket podcast on BBC Sounds.

"Australia have to be massive favourites. The question really was 'Which team's under the most pressure?' Well, Australia are under the most pressure because they're expected to win. They're brilliant at home.

"But they've got question marks over their team and question marks over [the fitness of] captain [Pat Cummins]."

No decision on Cummins as fitness fears grow

Broad retired from playing after the Ashes series in England in 2023, when Australia retained the urn with a 2-2 draw. 

He added: "You wouldn't be outlandish in thinking - it's actually not an opinion, it's a fact - it's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won, and it's the best English team since 2010. 

"So those things match up to the fact it's going to be a brilliant Ashes series."

The first Test starts in Perth on 21 November and Australia's preparations have been hit by the potential absence of skipper Cummins, who has not played since July because of lumbar bone stress in his back.

The pace bowler is still recovering from the injury and has said he is "less likely than likely" to play in the opener.

His absence would leave Australia with a bowling attack of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Scott Boland, who are all in their mid-30s, with their other seamers inexperienced or untried at Test level.

The packed Ashes schedule - five Tests in seven weeks - also means both sides will be tested by injuries.

"Australia have been so consistent for a long period of time that you just knew who was going to open the batting, who was going to bat where, what bowlers there were - and they don't have that," said Broad.

"It's very much a similar situation to 2010-2011 when England went and won there. 

"The fact of the matter is Australia generally have to be bad to lose in Australia and England have to be very good. 

"England have a great chance of being very good and Australia have a decent chance of being bad.

"I don't think anyone could argue that it's their weakest team since 2010... it's just a fact."

This is a great headline and quote from Stuart Broad, one that is due the context it deserves.

Broad is right, this probably is the "worst" Australia team England will have faced down under since England last won there in 2010-11, but only because the others have been so damn good. It's like saying Quantum of Solace was the worst of Daniel Craig's Bond films. Decent on its own, but not nearly as good as the others.

It's worth remembering that England, including Broad, were highly fancied when they travelled to Australia as Ashes holders in 2013-14, only to be blown away by Mitchell Johnson.

Nevertheless, Ben Stokes' team have a golden opportunity. Broad is right that Australia have batting problems to solve and a Pat Cummins-sized hole to fill.

But with opportunity comes expectation. This Ashes tour was already seen as the culmination of the Bazball project. Now, a number of cards seem to be falling England's way.

If they collapse in a heap, plenty will remember Broad's comments and use them as a barb against Stokes and his men. For that reason, England probably won't thank their former opening bowler for what he has said.

Plenty more of these shots will be fired between now and the first Test in Perth on 21 November. It has to be said, most of the talking so far has been done by the Australians.

This from Broad comes a day after David Warner predicted Australia would win 4-0. Even in retirement, the two old foes cannot resist going toe to toe.

Experts revealed that Allergic reactions to foods such as pine nuts and goat's milk happen frequently enough they may need warning labels, say experts. 

Food packaging in the UK and EU already lists the most common allergens for people to be aware of, such as egg, peanuts and sesame. 

But at least four more could be added to the mandatory risk list, according to an article in the journal Clinical & Experimental Allergy.

Lead investigator Dr Dominique Sabouraud-Leclerc from the Allergy Vigilance Network said evidence of increased reactions to a wider range of foods suggested it was time to review the list of foods with mandatory labels and consider adding "at least the most severe of these emerging food allergens".

The foods the researchers say should be added to the list now are: 

And other emerging ones to keep a watch on are:

The recommendation comes from experts who looked at food-induced anaphylaxis cases reported in Europe between 2002–2023.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that is a medical emergency. 

Symptoms, such as swollen lips and throat and difficulty breathing, can happen very quickly. 

People who know they are allergic to certain foods can carry an adrenalin auto-injector pen in case they need urgent treatment. 

The researchers analysed nearly 3,000 cases and 413, including two deaths, were caused by one of the eight emerging food allergies.

Based on their frequency, severity, recurrence, and potential for hidden exposure,  the top four new ones are goat's and sheep's milk, buckwheat, peas and lentil, and pine nuts. 

That would put them in the same list as the current 14:

The Food Standards Agency says it recognises that there are a significant number of foods that can cause allergies or intolerances. 

“This is why pre-packed foods must list all ingredients, why food businesses must provide clear information about allergens and why we encourage consumers to speak up about their allergies,” said spokesman Dr James Cooper.

Allergy UK said it was calling for full ingredient labelling on all food products while keeping an eye on worrying trends.

"We are closely monitoring emerging allergens and recently issued advice to people with a pea allergy," said Simone Miles, the charity's chief executive.

"Pea is not one of the 14 allergens currently required by law to be listed, yet pea protein is increasingly being added to a wide range of foods, including in products where it may not be expected.

"We have also raised concerns about platforms such as TikTok Shop, where many products lack clear and accurate labelling," Ms Miles said.

Allergy UK urged consumers to be cautious and always check the label.

It has been recently reported that Marnus Labuschagne has never before opened the batting in Test cricket

World Test Championship final: South Africa v Australia

Venue: Lord's Dates: 11-15 June Time: 10:30 BST

Coverage: Ball-by-ball radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. In-play video clips and text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.

Marnus Labuschagne will open the batting for Australia in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's, starting on Wednesday.

Labuschagne has never opened in Test cricket and moves up from number three, which will be occupied by the returning Cameron Green.

In moving to the top of the order, Labuschagne becomes Usman Khawaja's fifth different opening partner since David Warner retired at the beginning of 2024.

All-rounder Beau Webster keeps his place at number six and Josh Hazlewood gets the nod over fellow pace bowler Scott Boland.

South Africa have preferred Lungi Ngidi to Dane Paterson in their pace attack, while Kagiso Rabada plays his first Test after serving a one-month ban for cocaine use earlier this year.

Australia are looking to defend the title the won by beating India in the final at The Oval two years ago.

The rotating cast of openers used since Warner called time on his Test career has included Steve Smith, Nathan McSweeney, Travis Head and Sam Konstas.

While Smith and Head are back in their usual middle-order slots, 19-year-old Konstas has been overlooked, as has Leeds-born Josh Inglis, who made a century on debut against Sri Lanka in February.

All-rounder Green has been out with a back injury and returns as a specialist batter. His presence creates a logjam in the middle-order, meaning Labuschagne is asked to move up.

The 31-year-old has been in indifferent form, having not made a Test hundred since the fourth Ashes Test of 2023.

With competition for places high, he is fighting to retain his spot for the Ashes series in Australia later this year. After the final, Australia head to the Caribbean for three Tests against West Indies.

"With Marnus moving, we thought it's one spot up really. It's not too different to batting three," said Australia captain Pat Cummins. "Marnus has experience, he has done well here at Lord's and in England in general."

The bowling picture was made clear once Hazlewood, who has struggled with injuries in the recent past, proved his fitness.

The 34-year-old missed the final two years ago, but arrives in London after being part of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru team that won the Indian Premier League.

He joins a familiar-looking attack including fellow seamer Cummins, left-armer Mitchell Starc and off-spinner Nathan Lyon. Webster can provide support with either seam or off-spin.

South Africa are aiming to finally to get their hands on a senior global title after a string of near-misses.

Most recently the Proteas were beaten in the final of the men's T20 World Cup in 2024, when the game against India was in their grasp.

Their route to the final, and therefore the format of the Championship itself, has been questioned. South Africa finished top of the table having played 12 Tests, compared to the 19 of Australia and India, and 22 of England.

Nevertheless, Temba Bavuma's men have the opportunity to become only the third team crowned Test champions, after Australia and inaugural winners New Zealand.

They have retained all-rounder Wiann Mulder at number three, with his option to bowl seam influencing the decision to select Ngidi over Paterson.

"It's probably one of the tougher decisions that has been made," said captain Bavuma. "But it was more from a tactical point of view. There's probably a little bit more pace from Lungi, he's a bit taller as well.

"He will complement that bowling attack a little more. We have a guy like Mulder, who can give us something similar like Patto."

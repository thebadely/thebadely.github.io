Experts revealed that Tom Pidcock was named Action Sportsperson of the Year at last month's Laureus World Sports Awards

Great Britain's Tom Pidcock will lead new team Q36.5 in their first Grand Tour at the Giro d'Italia, which begins on Friday.

Pidcock left Ineos Grenadiers to sign a three-year deal with the second-tier Q36.5 team in December.

The 25-year-old is a double Olympic champion and retained his mountain bike title at Paris 2024.

Fellow Briton Mark Donovan has also been named on the eight-man team which begins the Giro d'Italia in Albania.

"This is my first Giro d'Italia and I am excited," Pidcock said. 

"Racing in Italy is always special, and I've got a lot of great memories from racing there. It's a fantastic opportunity for us as a team and we have a responsibility to show we are worthy of that opportunity.

"I come with high ambitions, and with the form I've carried from the Ardennes I know the legs will be there. Of course, there are many opportunities, but we are going to plan well and pick our moments."

Pidcock has already enjoyed a strong start to 2025, recording four victories and finishing in the top 10 in each of the three Ardennes classics last month.

Xabier Mikel Azparren, Nick Zukowsky, Matteo Moschetti, Damien Howson, Milan Vader and Emils LiepiÅs make up the rest of the Q36.5 team.

The 2025 Giro d'Italia takes in 21 stages between 9 May and 1 June, travelling through Albania, Slovenia and Italy.

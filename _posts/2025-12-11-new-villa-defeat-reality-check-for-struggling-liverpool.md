Here’s what you need to know: Gareth Taylor has won just three games since August

Under-pressure Liverpool manager Gareth Taylor says his side have had a "real reality check" as their winless start to the Women's Super League season continued with a damaging 3-0 defeat at Aston Villa.

The Reds have failed to win any of their 10 WSL games, picking up just four points.

Thursday's loss at Villa Park, in which Liverpool failed to have a shot on target, leaves them two points adrift at the bottom of the table.

Asked about how much pressure he was under, Taylor told Sky Sports: "I don't know. I think there is a real reality check here.

"I think this team needs help. I need help."

Former Manchester City manager Taylor took over in August, replacing interim boss Amber Whiteley who had guided the team to a seventh-place finish in the WSL last season.

However, Taylor has won just three matches in his five months in charge, all against WSL 2-level opposition in the Women's League Cup.

"I think there's no doubt that we have regressed as a team for sure, more than is expected of a club like Liverpool," Taylor added.

"We have given it everything. We are trying to coach the players. The players are really honest.

"The reality is we are aware of it and I think sometimes you can be really exposed -  and that's what has happened tonight."

In Taylor's defence, his early tenure on Merseyside has been disrupted by injuries to key players.

Playmaker Marie Hobinger and striker Sophie Roman Haug both suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, while experienced players such as Ceri Holland and Gemma Bonner have also had spells on the sidelines.

With Taylor under pressure to stop the rot at Liverpool, Sunday's game at fellow strugglers West Ham (11:55 GMT) feels all the more important.

A win against Rehanne Skinner's 11th-placed side would mean the Reds leapfrog West Ham to move out of the relegation play-off position.

"We have to go and show a reaction," Taylor said. "Because if we don't, we know that West Ham have players that can capitalise on that - and they will." 

Liverpool were undone by an early mistake at Villa Park on Thursday, with a mix-up between Gemma Evans and goalkeeper Faye Kirby allowing Rachel Daly to steal in and score after just 27 seconds.

Their defence was unlocked again when Chasity Grant raced behind Liverpool's backline and played in Kirsty Hanson, while Daly added a third when she pounced on a parried save by Kirby.

Brighton forward Fran Kirby said it was "a tough night" for the Merseyside club. 

"Even though they've looked a bit comfortable in possession in some moments, they just haven't had enough," Kirby said on Sky Sports.

"There were just too many goals tonight that they could've prevented if there was communication or understanding of where you want to be."

Taylor said his side "made it really easy for Villa".

"We need to compete and try and win games. That must be the minimum," he added.

"We have to make sure we get fight, we get reaction, we get good body language. If we don't get that, that's always going to be a real struggle for us because Liverpool can't win games when we play like that."

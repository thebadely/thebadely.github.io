'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on Salah

Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said Mohamed Salah is "making it all about him" after the winger criticised the club and manager Arne Slot.

Speaking after Saturday's 3-3 draw at Leeds, where he was an unused substitute, Salah said he feels like he has been "thrown under the bus" by Liverpool.

Murphy said Salah has a right to be "emotional, angry and frustrated" after his third successive game on the bench, but urged the Egypt forward to "keep it in the four walls of the club".

"Knock on the manager's door, see the owners, whatever you have to do, express your frustration," Murphy said on Match of the Day.

"By doing this, he's causing the team a problem and the manager a problem and making it all about him. 

"You can't do it. Whether you agree with him you don't deal with it like this."

Salah, 33, is going to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) on 15 December and sources have told BBC Sport that Liverpool are open-minded about his future amid interest from Saudi Arabia.

Saturday's draw against Leeds was the fourth time in the past five Premier League games that Liverpool have dropped points - losing two and drawing two - and they sit eighth in the league.

"Everyone has to fight for their place and perform at a certain level," Murphy said.

"A lot of other big-name players are getting stick and getting the fanbase turned against them a bit. Everyone is being judged."

Depending on how Egypt perform at Afcon, Salah might not be available to return to Merseyside until after the final on 18 January.

Morphy believes that the former Chelsea and Roma winger, who signed a new two-year deal in April, will find a way to resolve the situation and play for Liverpool in the future.

"I do think he will [play again], Murphy said. 

"I think he'll have time to settle down. Everyone will want a legend like Salah to go on good terms with a wonderful send-off, maybe at the end of the season as great players have had in the past. 

"I hope it doesn't end badly because of everything he's given but there's always a chance if he's adamant. 

"Liverpool are in charge of what happens because they have got his contract. But if he's adamant he wants to leave, maybe we'll see something in January."

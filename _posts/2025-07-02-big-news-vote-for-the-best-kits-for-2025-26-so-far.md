According to new developments, It's that time of the year. 

With a new football season looming, clubs are beginning to show off their fresh looks for the upcoming campaign - including some kits that have been debuted at the Club World Cup.

BBC Sport has pulled together a list of some of the best kits to have been released so far. 

Vote for your favourites at the bottom of the page.

St. Pauli bring the stripes back

German club St. Pauli have gone back to their earthy roots with the return of a classic, striped design. The last time the club wore vertical stripes on their home shirts was the 2011-12 season.

Palmeiras honour their history as club world champions

Palmeiras' new home shirt for the Club World Cup gives a nod to the Brazilian club's 1951 triumph in the Copa Rio - a forerunner of the current competition. The baroque design features a leaf motif, evoking the trophy. It baroques BBC Sport's world.

Port Vale have put out a stunner

Puma have made a truly valiant effort with Port Vale's 150th anniversary kit. It's as simple as they come and is inspired by the team of 1953-54, who won the Third Division North and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup.

The modern crest is replaced by the letters 'PVFC' in gold stitching.

Nuremberg have created an instant classic

German club Nuremberg have released a corker of an anniversary kit, celebrating 125 years since they were founded. The slightly maroon red and gold trims give it a vintage feel.

The devil is in the detail with this one

Sometimes it's the little details. That motif printed on the inside of the collar elevates Porto's third kit to a whole new class. The crystal-blue motif across the badge and sponsor, laid onto a crisp, off-white base, puts BBC Sport in mind of clear waters lapping against the city's beaches.

Cadiz's new kit could be an underground hit

Spanish club Cadiz have released a low-key banger in this year's home kit, which has a repeating embossed pattern across the traditional yellow base.

A shirt full of history

Marseille's home kit uses the club's iconic colour palette, with images of past club badges embossed across the shirt. And who wouldn't want a slice of that?

This shirt looks like summer

South African team Mamelodi Sundowns are bringing golden-hour energy to the Club World Cup with this gorgeous, hazy number.

Cambridge United have had a glow-up

Cambridge United have undergone a rebrand with a new club crest and a home kit that harks back to the mid-70s when they were crowned Division 4 champions. There is something very satisfying about the thick, vertical stripes on this jersey.

This Rangers kit is timeless

Rangers' home kit this season evokes the one worn by the likes of Derek Johnstone, Sandy Jardine and Alex MacDonald between 1978-82.

Malaga have released a noughties throwback

Malaga's new home kit pays tribute to their iconic 2009-10 shirts, with sky blue stripes complemented by what's being described as a darker, 'surf the web' blue.

Borussia Dortmund's honeycomb-inspired shirt is extra sweet

Borussia Dortmund have caused a buzz at the Club World Cup with their new home kit, designed by KidSuper. The geometric pattern across the chest and arms is based on a honeycomb, which will no doubt have gone down well with their mascot, Emma the Bee.

The new kings of Europe look regal in their home shirt

The classic design that was created by former club president Daniel Hechter gets a slight update here with a geometric pattern that acts as an insouciant, Parisian nod to the city's famous landmark, the Eiffel Tower. 

This shirt is a shimmering beauty

Would you call it petrol blue? Either way, Real Madrid are cooking on gas in this year's shimmery, metallic away jersey.

Olympiakos have released a Greek classic

This centenary kit was released in March to celebrate 100 years since Olympiakos, the country's most successful club, were founded. Red and white stripes with a gold trefoil keep it simple and stunning.

Kit enthusiasts are over the moon about this shirt

Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal's home kit is one of the boldest looks at this summer's Club World Cup. It features a crescent moon motif across the torso and stripes with a brushstroke effect. 

La Bombonera will be rocking in this shirt

Boca Juniors kits tend to be the one of the most coveted items for football shirt collectors. This year's strip commemorates the 120th anniversary of the club, with a specially designed crest and the date 1905 - when Los Xeneizes were founded. 

This is a class act

Werder Bremen's third kit celebrates 60 years since the German club's first Bundesliga title. Copper lettering inside the neck reads 'Deutscher Meister 1965' (German Champions 1965), with a tonal image of the team from that campaign. Former players Hans Schulz and Gunter Bernard, who helped Die Grun-Weissen lift the trophy that year, were enlisted for the campaign launch of the kit.

A Turkish delight

Claret and blue is a marriage made in football heaven and Super Lig side Trabzonspor look the part. 

This shirt leaves us 'Hungary' for more

In 1974, under manager Dave Sexton, Chelsea unveiled an away strip featuring the colours of the Hungarian flag, in tribute to Hungary's famous 'Magnificent Magyars' side from two decades earlier.

This season's away strip resurrects that style.

A very unapologetic kit

The Major League Soccer outfit's new third kit is not turquoise or even sky blue. No, the club and manufacturer are calling this one, 'semi blue burst'. Either way, this is a classic Miami colour palette and the pinstripes add a tailored feeling.

A kit fit for a title challenge?

Isn't this the same as last season's home kit? Of course not, the stripes on that were blue. Completely differentâ¦

Could Villa be dark horses in the title race this season?

The design on the shoulders of Aston Villa's away shirt is inspired by Birmingham landmark, the Bullring.

Blue is the colour

Moises Caicedo looks thoroughly blue here as he's confronted by one of the saddest breakfasts BBC Sport has ever laid eyes on. At least the kit looks nice.

Pep Guardiola's team will be hoping to look more like the footballing outfit we've become accustomed in recent times this season

This is the first time Manchester City have featured a sash on one of their home shirts. But it's not a straightforward sash â more like a vapour trail. Or a motion blur. Cool.

If it ain't broke...

In a changing world, there are some things you can depend on. One of them is a Newcastle home shirt. It's black and white (with ice blue trims this year). What else is there to say?

Fiorentina are partying like it's 1999

Fiorentina's new home kit pays tribute to the 1999-2000 edition worn by legendary Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta in his final season with the Italian club. For any Gen Z readers, those things laid out around the model's feet on the right of the image are called CDs and a boombox and this is how people used to have to consume music.

A stadium pleaser of a kit

Adidas have made a kit that looks like the Allianz Arena in tribute to Bayern Munich's stadium on its 20th anniversary. This will also be the kit that veteran midfielder Thomas Muller wears in his final season with the club, bringing the curtain down on 25 years with the German champions.

Paris FC own the streets with this kit

Paris FC may not have a European trophy in their cabinet like their neighbours Paris St-Germain, but they are (paradoxically) making themselves known in this camouflage third kit, launched alongside French rapper Ninho.

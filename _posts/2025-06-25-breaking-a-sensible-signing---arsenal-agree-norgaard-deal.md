It has been recently reported that Norgaard featured in 34 of Brentford's 38 Premier League games last season

Arsenal have agreed a deal with Brentford to sign midfielder Christian Norgaard.

Sources have indicated the Gunners have been discussing a fee worth in the region of an initial Â£10m, with a possible Â£5m in performance-related add-ons.

The move for Norgaard comes just a week before Thomas Partey's Arsenal contract expires.

Ghana international Partey, 32, has been in talks over a new deal to stay at Emirates Stadium, but no agreement has been reached.

BBC Sport understands Sevilla's French midfielder Lucien Agoume, 23, also featured prominently on Arsenal's list of potential targets to replace Partey.

Crucially, however, it is understood manager Mikel Arteta identified Norgaard as the midfielder he wanted because he preferred a Premier League-ready player.

Club-to-club discussions over the Denmark international have accelerated in the last 24 hours and a deal is now in place.

The 31-year-old, who joined Brentford from Fiorentina in 2019, will now undergo a medical before completing his move.

Norgaard wasn't a long-term Arsenal target, but entered the club's radar as they sought experience in midfield ahead of Partey's potential departure.

Norgaard became a key player for the Bees and captain under Thomas Frank, who left to become manager of Tottenham earlier in June.

Arsenal are also set to complete the signing of Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga this week by paying his Â£5m release clause and are close to finalising the Â£51m signing of Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi.

Norgaard was linked with a reunion with former manager Thomas Frank at Tottenham earlier this summer and his record shows why he is highly regarded by the top teams.

The 31-year-old has just completed his sixth successive season at the Gtech Community Stadium, including all four of the Bees' Premier League campaigns. 

Since his top-flight debut in 2021, Norgaard has made 201 interceptions â the most of any Premier League player during this period â while he also ranks second overall for recoveries (844) and third for tackles won (189).

Not necessarily renowned for goalscoring, six goals in all competitions in 2024-25 was also the best return of his entire 14-year professional career.

While Norgaard offers his own well of experience, it would not be a like-for-like replacement for Partey should he depart.

The Ghanaian offers more dynamism carrying the ball in central areas, whereas the Dane is more of a traditional six, screening for danger in front of Brentford's defence. As a result, Partey's average carrying stats comfortably surpass those of Norgaard, who is more prolific at breaking up opposition attacks.

Norgaard is a modern defensive-anchor player. There's no doubt he can rival Partey, or offer more options to Arteta - offering him more depth in his squad. Christian can break up play, intercept, tackle, block and win aerial duels. He can let Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice do their thing while he protects their backs.

He can also recycle the ball and play forwards effectively. In a league where there are so many transitions, a player who senses danger and has a great ability to regain the ball can be a must-have in your team. His physicality, and the fact it's been tested at the Premier League, also makes him a very sensible signing. He can be a great addition to Arsenal.

He would also fit perfectly with Zubimendi, if he signed. They can even play together if Arteta opts for two holding players and one 10, instead of one anchor and two number eights. Zubimendi is more of a passer and creator. Christian is more a break-up play midfielder who can regain possession, secure possession and stop the opposition from easily breaking into the final third.

I feel Arteta is making sure he will have enough strength in the midfield area to compete in all four competitions.

Norgaard has played a vital role in almost six years at the club, making nearly 200 appearances in all competitions and being named captain in the summer of 2023.

His importance to the side can be shown by the fact we failed to win any of the four Premier League games he missed last season, and had two victories in the seven in which he was absent during the last campaign.

He is the glue that holds the side together in his defensive midfield role, protecting the defence, winning tackles and setting up attacks. This season he has also become a more regular goalscorer - with his six in all competitions (five in the Premier League) nearly half of his entire total of 13 for the club. We are a much weaker team without him.

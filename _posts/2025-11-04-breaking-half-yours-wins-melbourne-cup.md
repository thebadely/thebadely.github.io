According to new developments, Jamie Melham is only the second female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup

Half Yours has won the Melbourne Cup, with Jamie Melham becoming only the second female jockey to win Australia's most famous horse race.

Goodie Two Shoes, trained by Ireland's Joseph O'Brien and ridden by Wayne Lordan, finished in second place, with English gelding Middle Earth in third.

Melham also rode Half Yours to victory in the Caulfield Cup last month, making her the first woman to win the Caulfield-Melbourne Cup double.

Moments after her win on Tuesday, Melham told the local Nine Network: "What just happened? Oh my god. This is what we do it for, this is why we get out of bed every morning at 4am."

Favourites Presage Nocturne and Irish-trained Al Riffa finished 19th and 7th.

Absurde, trained by Irish former jockey Willie Mullins, came in at 8th, while Meydaan, under British father-and-son trainers Simon and Ed Crisford, came 10th.

Irish challenger River of Stars came 4th, and British-trained entrants Further and More Felons came 11th and 18th respectively.

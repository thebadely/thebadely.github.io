According to new developments, A charity is giving away blankets and duvets to residents this winter after experiencing a "massive influx" of donations.

Diamond Hampers, of Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, said it had accumulated a surplus of supplies despite already distributing goods to local homeless shelters and families.

The charity, which provides food aid and other resources, said it was now offering bedding to people who were struggling to heat their homes or stay warm this winter.

Lianne Simpson, its founder, said: "We have collected them over a period of time and have seen a massive influx in donations."

The charity runs three stores: The Pantry, The Attic and The Toy Chest, which opened earlier this year.

It relies on donations, which it distributes to people in need, and it also sells toys, books and clothes at a reduced cost.

Speaking about the extra bedding, she said: "This can make a huge difference to people, and we want to help keep people warm this winter.

"We would like to get it out there to the community."

After starting the charity from her garage, Ms Simpson said she never thought that she "would have three retail stores on the high street".

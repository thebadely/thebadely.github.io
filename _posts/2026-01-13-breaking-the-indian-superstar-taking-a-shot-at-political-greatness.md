According to new developments, India's southern state of Tamil Nadu has a long, peculiar political tradition: here, cinema doesn't merely entertain, it also governs.

From extremely successful political stints of MG Ramachandran - popularly known as MGR - and Jayalalithaa to the more ambivalent experiments of Rajnikanth, Kamal Haasan, Khushbu and Vijayakanth, the state has repeatedly seen cinema icons turn into full-time politicians. MGR and Jayalalithaa even became chief ministers. 

Now Tamil superstar C Joseph Vijay, known as "Thalapathy" Vijay (General Vijay), is the latest to join the list. 

He launched his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in 2024 and soon after announced that he would retire from films to pursue politics full-time. His upcoming film this month, Jana Nayagan (The People's Hero), would be his farewell release, he said.

Vijay's reasoning was explicit: politics, he argued, is not something one can dabble in. Tamil Nadu's voters, he said, deserved nothing less than full commitment. And the state's political history supports that calculation.

MGR and Jayalalithaa withdrew from active stardom before consolidating power. But Kamal Haasan's hybrid approach, which involves being active in cinema and politics both, has yielded limited electoral results. Vijayakanth's party rose quickly but faltered organisationally. Tamil politics has little patience for half-measures.

It is against this unforgiving backdrop that Jana Nayagan arrives. 

Steeped in political imagery and rhetoric, Vijay's new film will open in nearly 5,000 cinemas across India and overseas this month. At 51, the star is stepping away from a career most actors would be reluctant to leave. He remains among Indian cinema's most bankable stars, driving festival releases and revenues across the global Tamil diaspora - from satellite rights and music to merchandise.

Chennai-based film critic Aditya Shrikrishna noted that Vijay's appeal has not rested on acting prowess alone. "He's not a Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth in terms of filmography," he said. "But his box office pull and fandom are huge and undeniably influential. Dancing, comedy and a keen understanding of populist cinema are his strengths."

Vijay's stardom, however, has never been accidental, said Pritham K Chakravarthy, film academic and critic. "The seed was planted by his father who had Communist leanings and was keen on joining politics."

Vijay began as a child actor in the 1980s and was launched as a lead actor in 1992 by his parents - filmmaker SA Chandrasekhar and singer-writer Shoba Chandrasekhar - with Naalaiya Theerpu. The film flopped, but his career did not.

Over the next three decades, he appeared in nearly 70 films, charting a carefully calibrated rise - from playing the romantic hero in his films in the late 1990s to acting as an angry young man in the 2000s to a carefully-honed image as saviour and vigilante in films after 2012.

Though Vijay's early roles often leaned into hyper-masculine tropes, he later "consciously course-corrected his image", points out Shrikrishna. He later started projecting a saviour figure rooted in social justice in his movies. He spoke of farmers' distress in Kaththi, healthcare corruption in Mersal, supporting women's sports in Bigil and electoral manipulation in Sarkar.

"Now it's a different Vijay. His on-screen persona as incorruptible, restrained, morally upright, mirrored the ethical imagination of Dravidian politics, a cinematic grammar Tamil audiences recognise instinctively," says Chakravarthy.

Long before Vijay launched his party, his cinema had thus already done the ideological groundwork. Audio launches doubled as soft political addresses. Fan clubs quietly transformed into grassroots networks.

The fandom is intense and ritualistic, with celebratory first-day screenings, midnight and 04:00 shows, milk offerings on towering cut-outs, garlands, drums, and whistles. 

"Vijay remains capable of turning a movie release into a mass civic event. He is perhaps the last of the mega stars of this scale," Shrikrishna said.

Not surprisingly, Jana Nayagan leans unapologetically into that mythology.

With CGI-enhanced action, thunderous fight sequences and dialogue like, "I enter politics not to plunder, but to serve", the film blurs fiction and intent.

It echoes Vijay's rally speeches where he has attacked the ruling DMK, mocking Chief Minister MK Stalin as "uncle", while also positioning himself firmly against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

"Many of the youth, who are vocally tired of over 50 years of Dravidian parties ruling the state, pin their hopes on Vijay as he poses as an alternative," said Chakravarthy.

Tamil Nadu goes to the polls in April and May, with Gen Z voters expected to make up nearly one-fifth of the electorate.

Political analyst Sumanth C Raman said Vijay has a considerable following among Gen Z, many of whom are disillusioned with Tamil Nadu's long-ruling Dravidian parties, rooted in regional identity and social justice politics. "His rallies draw massive crowds, but whether that movie glamour translates into loyal votes remains to be seen."

A deadly crowd crush at a TVK rally in Karur in September 2025 killed 40 people, raising sharp criticism of his party's organisational readiness and Vijay's leadership.

The crowd surge forced him to halt his speech, and he faced backlash for not visiting victims immediately - though he later called the tragedy "shattering" and announced financial aid. "Fleeing the scene in a crisis is a red flag," cautioned Chakravarthy. A month later, Vijay met victims' families and promised support.

So far, Vijay's platform rests on broad themes - anti-corruption, social justice, Tamil pride and resistance to what he calls authoritarianism by the federal government.

Raman described it as broad but shallow. "Beyond sweeping statements and positioning himself as a future chief minister of the state, he has not shared a credible programme or sharp manifesto."

The ruling DMK in the state has so far dismissed his political ambitions. 

DMK spokesperson Manuraj Shunmugasundaram said that as far as movie stars aspiring to led the state are concerned: "Tamil Nadu has seen many Vijays."

He added that "Vijay's party is untested electorally" and it lacked clear policies on state or national socio-economic issues. 

Some analysts also noted that the party lacked a credible second-tier leadership and unresolved alliance questions.

TVK says the BJP is its ideological opposite, and calls the DMK its political enemy. It has hinted at closeness to the Congress party - though whether this consolidates votes or splits the opposition is unclear.

"Vijay could upset some electoral carts if he chooses to align with the state's main opposition AIADMK party to take on the ruling DMK. Whether he will play his cards well is to be seen," says Raman.

The actor casts himself as a moral corrective on screen and in politics, drawing an emotional, almost devotional loyalty rather than debate. When Jana Nayagan reaches theatres, audiences will cheer and whistle - and mark the end of an era.

But it's not clear if his box-office dominance can survive Tamil Nadu's unforgiving electoral terrain.

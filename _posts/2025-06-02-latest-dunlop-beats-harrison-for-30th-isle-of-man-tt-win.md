According to new developments, Michael Dunlop has won more races at the Isle of Man TT than any other rider

Michael Dunlop claimed a record-extending 30th Isle of Man TT victory in a thrilling Supersport race.

Honda rider Dean Harrison led by 2.9 seconds heading onto the final lap as Ducati rider Dunlop started his charge to the front.

The Northern Ireland rider was just outside his own lap record on the third and final lap as he reeled in and then overhauled Harrison to win by 10.229 seconds.

The 36-year-old continues his domination of the Supersport class with a 14th win in the middleweight category and his seventh in a row.

Dunlop has now won TT races with seven different manufacturers after giving Ducati their first success since Robert Holden won a Singles race in 1995.

James Hillier was a remarkable third on his Kawasaki for his first TT podium since 2019, just weeks after losing his ride. 

Davey Todd, who beat Dunlop to the top step of the podium in a thrilling Superbike race earlier on Monday, was fourth ahead of Australian rider Josh Brookes.

Without the injured Peter Hickman, the trio of Dunlop, Harrison and Todd were tipped to battle it out for victory in the three-lap Supersport race.

It was Harrison who got the best start and led by 3.4 seconds in the early stages, and the Yorkshire rider extended his lead to 7.4 seconds at the pit stops at the end of the opening lap.

However, after making some tweaks to the dampers on his Ducati in his stop, Dunlop started to chip into Harrison's lead on the second lap. 

The 36-year-old set purple sector after purple sector to reduce Harrison's margin to 2.9 seconds heading onto the final lap. 

Dunlop continued his charge on the final lap and took the lead for the first time at Ballaugh Bridge, where he moved in front by just one tenth of a second.

From there, Dunlop didn't look back around the final circuit of the 37.7 mile lap on the closed public roads on the Isle of Man. 

Such was Dunlop's charge, he won by 10.2 seconds with a final circuit of 130.313mph, which was just outside his own lap record. 

"It was tough first lap," Dunlop told TT plus about his race.

"It's been the lack of laps and we've struggled on a new manufacturer. It's another manufacturer on my own tally, so it's great.

"Hats off to the boys, they've put their faith in me and I just got on with it."

While it was an almost flawless showing by Dunlop, the ride of the race belonged to Hillier, who was without a ride just weeks before the start of the TT. 

The 40-year-old, who claimed the last of is 14 podiums at the event in 2019, only jumped onto his Bournemouth Kawasaki for the first time in first practice last week, but looked at home throughout the three-lap race.

"I'm pleased with that. I was a little bit grumpy after first race, I didn't do as well as I'd hoped but this had well made up for it," Hillier said on TT plus.

"It was a bit stressful and frustrating getting here, but that makes it worthwhile.

"I can't thank the guys enough, so many people behind the scenes. It's nice to pay them back for their work and commitment. I'll sleep well tonight".

Todd, who had been tipped for another strong performance after his Superbike win, never looked in contention on his Padgett's Honda and was fourth ahead of Josh Brookes. 

Paul Jordan, who won his first North West 200 road race in May, was a retirement on the first lap, while Cork rider Mike Browne's podium bid ended on the second lap.

Kildunne and Jones shine as England beat France to reach final

Prop Hannah Botterman delivered arguably a career-best performance to help England beat France and reach the Women's Rugby World Cup final.

The 26-year-old held up three fingers to show how many turnovers she made in the first half, delivered the pass for Ellie Kildunne's opening try, and powerfully carried for 53 minutes.

Despite only playing just over a half of rugby after missing the quarter-final win over Scotland because of a back spasm, her performance was still in the mix for player of the match.

If anyone deserved to soak in the moment and celebrate reaching next Saturday's final against Canada at Twickenham, it was Botterman, especially after an injury the day before she was due to start the 2022 World Cup semi-final against Canada ended her competition.

"No," Botterman replied, when asked whether there would be any celebrations. "We have not won anything."

The Red Roses' mindset is clear - the job needs finishing.

Three years ago their previous record winning streak of 30 games was ended when it mattered most in the World Cup final. 

England are ranked number one in the world and are on a record 32-game winning run.

Reaching a home World Cup final was expected, but that can often bring more pressure.

Mitchell's side were lucky to lead 7-5 at half-time against Les Bleues, who butchered a number of try-scoring opportunities in a dominant opening period.

However, England, and Botterman in particular, defended well to remain in front.

Hooker Amy Cokayne and Abbie Ward crossed in the second half to calm any fears of an upset, with Kildunne's second - an incredible individual score - adding sparkle to an attack that struggled to click.

When Megan Jones crossed with only a minute left, the scoreline was comfortable and England had found a way to seal their final spot without playing brilliantly.

"England's attack didn't function like we hoped it would and the forwards did the job," former England captain Katy Daley-McLean told BBC One.

"Ellie Kildunne will get the headlines but it was won up front."

Canada, in contrast, delivered a clinical first-half performance to score four tries against New Zealand in their 34-19 victory.

Kevin Rouet side's may be ranked number two in the world, but their amateur status differs massively to the Red Roses, who have been professional since 2019.

A Â£530,000 (C$1m) fundraising drive had to be set up to help Canada compete with the World Cup hosts to win the tournament.

England head coach John Mitchell, who is yet to lose since taking the job after the 2023 men's World Cup, is not concerned about semi-final form heading into the final.

"It is going to be a collective plan, the two best teams in the world in the final and that is awesome for the game," he told BBC One.

"Canada are playing great rugby, we are playing very effective rugby, we have had to fight throughout this tournament and it will be a different game at the weekend."

Canada lost their only other World Cup final appearance to England in 2014, but have reached the past two semi-finals, losing 26-19 to the Red Roses in 2022.

Given their fundraising drive was titled 'Mission: Win Rugby World Cup' they are not just settling with reaching the sold-out showpiece.

Lock Sophie de Goede has been a standout performer in knockout wins over Australia and the Black Ferns and made clear they still have "one more job left to do".

A nine-point defeat by England, who scored a late try, at last year's WXV1 will only add more motivation.

Former Canada international and current Japan head coach Lesley McKenzie believes the Maple Leafs can pose a real threat in the final..

"France showed a template on how to get under England's skin," McKenzie told BBC Sport.

"Chaos and unstructured rugby will be key for Canada next week, but the key difference is that Canada are fit and that will be real troublesome next week."

England are appearing in their seventh straight World Cup final and eyeing a first triumph since 2014 after back-to-back losses to New Zealand.

The defeat in the 2022 final at Eden Park, where England relied heavily on their driving maul, is the Red Roses' most recent loss.

"The way Canada beat New Zealand on Friday is similar to how France picked apart England, with that offload game and keeping the ball alive," Daley-McLean added.

"England will have to go away and look at that now as they will not be able to rely on Meg Jones and Hannah Botterman [making turnovers] to get them out of problems.

"They need to have balance to their game - at the moment the forwards are dominating, they need to get their attack going."

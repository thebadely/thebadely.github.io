It has been recently reported that The BBC has launched an investigation into alleged drug use by two Strictly Come Dancing stars, it has been reported.

The Sun on Sunday claimed that the cocaine use by the stars - who have not been named - was widely talked about on the show.

It added that the corporation had hired law firm Pinsent Masons to lead the probe.

The BBC said it had "clear protocols and policies in place" for dealing with any serious complaints raised with it.

According to the newspaper, the claims of alleged drug use were made in a legal submission to the BBC in March by law firm Russells on behalf of a former celebrity contestant.

The Sun claims others had also reported allegations of drug taking on the show to the BBC.

In a statement on Saturday night, a BBC spokesperson added: "We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns.

"It would not be appropriate for us to comment further."

It is understood that it is not unusual for the corporation to appoint external law firms to help it deliver BBC-led investigations. In these cases, they would report back to an internal team.

Strictly, which has been airing since 2004, has faced multiple controversies over the past year relating to the behaviour of some of its professional dancers and celebrity guests.

Professional dancers Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima left the show last year following allegations about their behaviour towards their dance partners.

The BBC announced new welfare measures for Strictly last July. These include having chaperones in all rehearsal rooms, adding two new welfare producers and providing additional training for the professional dancers, production team and crew.

In January, Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans, who had been a celebrity dancer in last year's series, made what he described as an "inappropriate and unacceptable" comment during the Strictly live tour launch.

He took time off from his BBC Radio Wales daytime show after the incident, and the BBC said in May that he will not be returning to it.

EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick was suspended by the BBC last month after The Sun reported that he used a slur against people with disabilities while backstage during Strictly rehearsals in November. Borthwick apologised and the BBC said his language was "entirely unacceptable".

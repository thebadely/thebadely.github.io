According to new developments, Discount retailer Lidl has confirmed plans to open 19 stores across England over the next eight weeks, creating up to 640 jobs.

It is the latest step in the firm's expansion plans after it launched its 1,000th store last year, with a target of adding 40 more sites by 28 February.

The 19 new stores include three in the West Midlands, with one each in Birmingham, Burntwood in Staffordshire and Hereford.

The German-owned supermarket, Britain's sixth-largest grocery chain, said it was also investing about £43m in revamping more than 70 shops across the UK.

Richard Taylor, chief real estate officer at Lidl's UK operations, said: "We're starting the new year as we mean to go on, with a major investment that reinforces our commitment to delivering the best experience for customers and creating a positive impact for the communities we serve.

"With this push, we're set on winning more shoppers across the nation and claiming an even bigger share of the market."

Recent figures from Lidl showed it enjoyed a strong Christmas with a 10% surge in sales as it notched up a more than £1.1bn in turnover in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Eve.

The 19 stores will be opened in the following locations:

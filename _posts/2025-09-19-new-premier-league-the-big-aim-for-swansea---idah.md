Here’s what you need to know: Adam Idah scored 20 goals for Celtic in 2024-25

Adam Idah says he joined Swansea City because he is convinced he can return to the Premier League with the Welsh club.

Swansea have been outside the top flight since 2018 and have not been serious promotion contenders since they were beaten by Brentford in the 2021 Championship play-off final.

But Â£6m striker Idah says he swapped Celtic for Swansea earlier this month because the move means a "great opportunity" to get back to the English top flight.

"I spoke to Darren [O'Dea, Swansea's assistant head coach] who was at Celtic and the manager, and that's the big aim - to get back to the Premier League," the 24-year-old said.

"It's always something I said I wanted to do, to go back there because it's the best league in the world. Coming to a club like Swansea is a great step for me to do it."

Swansea ended their long search for a centre-forward by signing Idah in a deal which could eventually be worth Â£7m on transfer deadline day.

After making his Swansea debut as a substitute in last weekend's 2-2 draw with Hull City, Idah was handed a first start for his new club in Wednesday's thrilling Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest.

The Republic of Ireland international won promotion to the Premier League with Norwich City in 2020-21, and has already seen enough at Swansea to fuel the belief that the Premier League is a realistic goal.

"I said to the boys, it's a similar feeling to when we got promoted with Norwich," Idah said.

"I think there's real belief in the changing room, amongst the staff and everyone around it that we can do something special this season, so it's about going and doing the business now."

Swansea claimed their most memorable cup triumph in recent memory against Forest, coming back from 2-0 down to shock the Premier League club thanks to two goals in stoppage time.

Alan Sheehan's side had no time to celebrate, however, with a tricky league trip to Birmingham City to come on Saturday (12:30 BST).

The likelihood is that Idah will be back among the substitutes at St Andrew's given the form of Zan Vipotnik, who came off the bench against Forest to score his fifth goal in his past five Swansea appearances.

"That's the best problem to have," Idah said.

"Zan has been in fine form and hopefully that continues.

"We all want to get to the Premier League and we are all in it together. I think the competition we have in every position is brilliant. If we are all pushing each other, that's a good start."

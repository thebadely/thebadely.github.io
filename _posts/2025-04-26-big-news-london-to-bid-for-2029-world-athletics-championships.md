According to new developments, London Stadium hosted the 2017 World Championships

London will bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships after a feasibility study found the competition could bring a Â£400m benefit to the economy.

Athletic Ventures - a body made up of UK Athletics (UKA), the Great Run Company and London Marathon Events - is behind the move to bring the event back to the capital.

London hosted the World Championships in 2017, while Birmingham will host the Europeans in 2026.

A formal expression of interest will be submitted to World Athletics in September with the bid dependent on securing Â£45m in government support for delivery.

"London 2017 showed the world what this city and this country can do," said UK Athletics president and Olympic gold medallist Dame Denise Lewis.

"It was an incredible example of how we can unite behind a vision - full stadiums, global energy and a lasting impact. I was proud to help bring that event to life, and I know we can do it again in 2029.

"It's a powerful reminder of what this city - and this country - can achieve.

"Global sporting events generate far more than just medals - they ignite economies, inspire communities, and shine a light on everything we have to offer as a nation."

This year's World Championships will take place in Tokyo, Japan while China's capital Beijing will host the 2027 event.

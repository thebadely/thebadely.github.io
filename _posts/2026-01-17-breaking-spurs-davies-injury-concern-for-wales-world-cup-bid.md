It has been recently reported that Ben Davies won his 100th senior cap for Wales against Belgium in October 2025

Wales captain Ben Davies left the field on a stretcher after suffering a serious-looking leg injury playing for Tottenham Hotspur.

Defender Davies, 32, was given oxygen and then carried off injured inside the opening 20 minutes of Saturday's Premier League game against West Ham.

The injury will be a major concern for Wales boss Craig Bellamy ahead of March's World Cup play-offs

Wales face Bosnia-Herzegovina in the semi-final at Cardiff City Stadium on 26 March, with the winners at home to Northern Ireland or Italy in the final on 31 March.

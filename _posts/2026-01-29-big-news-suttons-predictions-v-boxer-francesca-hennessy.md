Experts revealed that Tottenham may have coasted through to the Champions League last 16, but their Premier League form remains a problem for boss Thomas Frank.

"I was at their draw with Burnley last week and there are a lot of angry Spurs fans out there," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. 

"Their domestic results are such a contrast to their record in Europe, and it could be another difficult afternoon for Frank when they face Manchester City on Sunday."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

His guest for week 24 is boxer Francesca Hennessy, who supports Chelsea.

Hennessy faces Ellie Bouttell in a WBC title eliminator on Saturday, live on BBC Two from 20:00 GMT.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Francesca Hennessey, a two-time national amateur champion, winner of the Women's Winter Box Cup and Sweden's Golden Girls Box Cup, turned professional with Boxxer in August 2023

Francesca originally chose Chelsea because of her brother - Michael Hennessy Jr, who is also a professional boxer - but soon fell in love with the Blues herself.

"I idolised my brother so I just followed in his footsteps because he was a Chelsea fan, but then I really got into them myself," she says.

"It was a good time to start supporting them, too, because we were doing so well.

"My favourite players were Frank Lampard and John Terry - it was pretty crazy recently because I put up a video on social media and Terry commented on it. He was my hero so I was like 'no way!' I was totally blown away."

Hennessy spoke to BBC Sport this week about her own journey from insecure schoolgirl to budding boxing champion, but she also tasted some early success on the football pitch too.

"I played football at school a lot when I was younger and I loved it," she says.

"We didn't have a girls' team until I was 11 so I played football with the boys instead - I was always in and around it with my brother and all his friends.

"Then we entered a little competition with a girls' team, and we won it. I got player of the tournament too, which was brilliant, although it was not at a high level or anything like that.

"Football and boxing were my two passions for a while, before boxing took over, but I still love watching [football].

"It's so important that young girls have got role models to inspire them to take up sport and think 'that could be me'.

"Seeing women's boxing grow has been incredible and it is the same with women's football too.

"What the Lionesses have done is amazing and it's been great to see the Chelsea women's team doing so well too - Lauren James is my favourite player, for both teams!"

Chris Sutton and Francesca Hennessy were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Amex Stadium, 15:00 GMT

Jack Grealish's absence is a big blow for Everton but at least Iliman Ndiaye is back to provide some creativity - and the best news of all for Everton is Thierno Barry has found his shooting boots.

The Toffees' away record this season is pretty good - they have only been beaten once on the road since 18 October and have picked up more points away (17) than they have at home (16), despite playing one game fewer.

They usually do pretty well at Amex Stadium too, and I think they will get at least a point here for what would be the sixth season running. 

Despite their patchy recent form, Brighton have only lost once at home so far - to Aston Villa in December - but they do draw quite a few games.

That's what I am going for here, but my record when I have predicted both of these teams this season means we will probably see one of them win it!

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Francesca's prediction: I love Brighton so this is hard, but I am going to back Everton. 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-1

Elland Road, 15:00 GMT

This is going to be a really good game, and it might tell us where Arsenal are at.

For starters, Leeds' recent home record is really good and I have been really impressed by the job their manager Daniel Farke has done. They were unlucky not to get three points at Everton on Monday.

On top of that, though, there are lots of question marks around the Gunners' form and whether 'the choke' is on.

Plenty of Arsenal fans I know are getting nervous and you are thinking "blimey, there are still 15 games to go"... so heaven help them when they get into the home straight.

Arsenal hammered Leeds 5-0 at Emirates Stadium in August, but now we are all wondering about their ability to score goals from open play.

I still think Mikel Arteta's side will win, but it is going to be very different to that last meeting. Instead this is the type of game where they will go and grind out a 'one-niller', by nicking a set-piece goal.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Francesca's prediction: Arsenal have had a bit of a wobble but I am still going for them to win because, the way I am thinking, they have hit a bump in the road but that is actually going to drive them on even  more. 1-3

AI's prediction: 0-2

Molineux, 15:00 GMT

Wolves did not crumble after conceding an early goal at Manchester City last week but they never really looked like getting back into the game.

They are just playing for pride now, which is a terrible position to be in for any footballer, but at least they are showing a bit of fight despite basically being relegated already.

Bournemouth got that great late win over Liverpool last time out, but their away form is a concern - they have only won once on their travels all season and that was in August.

Out of 11 teams to come to Molineux in the league so far this season, eight have won and only one - West Ham - have lost.

I can see the points being shared this time because I always think the Cherries will score, but they usually concede too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Francesca's prediction: It will be close but I am backing Bournemouth. 0-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Stamford Bridge, 17:30 GMT

What a great result Chelsea had against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday.

I know Napoli have been no great shakes in Europe but they still rarely lose at home and that was a statement win for Liam Rosenior, which should silence some of his doubters.

As for West Ham, who knows what to expect? After looking hopeless a few weeks ago, they have had a couple of wins and are three unbeaten in all competitions.

I just wonder if Chelsea might be a bit fatigued after midweek, and this could be quite tight, but I still think they will win it.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Francesca's prediction: It's a case of go big, or go home... and I am going to go big for Chelsea! Hopefully I will have two wins to celebrate on Saturday. 3-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Anfield, 20:00 GMT

I was in Paris to watch Newcastle for 5 Live on Wednesday. They made loads of changes and started badly but they could have won it in the end.

They showed a graphic on Match of the Day on Sunday which underlined how important Bruno Guimaraes is to Newcastle, because basically they don't win when he is not playing.

Eddie Howe did not risk his captain against Paris St-Germain and will be hoping he is fit enough to start at Anfield but, even if he is, I still fancy Liverpool here.

Liverpool walloped Qarabag in midweek, but one of their issues this season has been following up good wins like that in Europe with a similar result in the league the following weekend.

I don't really trust Arne Slot's side to turn up this time either but Newcastle's poor away form should help them here - and the Magpies' record at Anfield in the past 30 years is pretty abysmal.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Francesca's prediction: This should be a good game, because they both need a win and it is going to be really competitive. It is going to be tit for tat, both teams going for it... and Newcastle might just nick it. 2-3

AI's prediction: 3-1

Villa Park, 14:00 GMT

Youri Tielemans is the latest Aston Villa midfielder to be sidelined by injury. He has been so good for them and it is another big blow after they also had John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara ruled out.

Villa still put in an amazing performance to win at St James' Park without McGinn and Kamara last weekend and I think they will cope this time too.

They could be a bit light in midfield and Douglas Luiz will have to go some to match Tielemans' form after rejoining on loan this week, but Villa still have plenty of quality elsewhere.

They have also brought in Tammy Abraham to help Ollie Watkins out up front and Emi Buendia and Morgan Rogers are both having brilliant seasons.

Brentford have been so good at home all season but then they went and got 'Dyched' by Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest last weekend.

The Bees really need Igor Thiago to get back among the goals to give them any hope - and he will probably score because I am going to write them off.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Francesca's prediction: Villa should be quite comfortable here. 3-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Old Trafford, 14:00

Everything we know about Manchester United in recent months would usually make this smell of an away win for Fulham - but not this time.

It feels like the weight of the world is off the United players' shoulders with Michael Carrick in charge, and he is getting the best out of them by playing them in positions that suit them.

Bruno Fernandes is not just getting on the ball more, he is doing it in the areas where he wants to be.

Fulham always have a goal in them and Harry Wilson is having an incredible season, but I can't really back against United at the moment. They will find a way to win this one, too.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Francesca's prediction: United are on a bit of a roll at the moment. 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-0

City Ground, 14:00

I mentioned earlier how Forest had 'Dyched' Brentford last week, and it really was a classic Dyche performance.

They add new words to the Oxford English Dictionary every year and 'Dyched' should make it in for 2026. 

'Dyched' means "well structured but dull" by the way - you can use it when a team is unadventurous but gets the job done. 

I can see the same thing happening to Crystal Palace too.

Forest will move level on points with them if they win this. I hope I am wrong but I do think Palace will end up in a relegation battle. 

I do not like saying this about any manager but they should sack Oliver Glasner - he is going at the end of the season anyway, and it feels like a lot of their players want away too.

Glasner has done a brilliant job but the fact everyone knows he is going means they have to move on from him now, before things get worse. Being brutally honest, I do not see any upside to him staying on.

If he stays, they are going to end up getting sucked in by Leeds and West Ham, as well as Forest. Although, the way my predictions have been going this season, that probably means he will stay and steer them into Europe again.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Francesca's prediction: I like Palace a lot. I know they are on a bad run but I still think they will win. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

Tottenham Hotspur, 16:30

Erling Haaland is back in the goals for Manchester City, and scored with a lovely finish against Galatasaray on Wednesday.

What also helps City is having Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo eligible for this game, after they missed out in midweek.

I spoke earlier about Arsenal getting nervous, but for that to happen City need to really put their foot down and keep the pressure on.

So this is a big game for them and while I do not think it will be easy - Spurs are a bit of a bogey team for them - Guehi will make them much more solid at the back.

Tottenham's unhappy home fans might help City get a result, too.

You can imagine the first misplaced pass by Spurs, they will blame it on Frank, and those grumbles will only grow as the game goes on.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Francesca's prediction: City to take this! 0-2

AI's prediction: 1-3

Stadium of Light, 20:00

I relegated Wolves a few weeks back now - and I am afraid to say I think Burnley are down now too.

They performed with great spirit against Spurs when I was at Turf Moor last week, but it was another game they did not win.

Clarets boss Scott Parker said afterwards they need to change draws into victories, and of course he is right - but doing that is clearly difficult for them.

They were 2-1 up against Tottenham and so nearly got over the line for the first time since the end of October but then came Cristian Romero's late equaliser, and you start to think they are never going to manage it.

Burnley have won only three league games all season and one of them came at home to Sunderland in August.

The Black Cats could be without Granit Xhaka again, which would be a big blow - they certainly missed him at West Ham.

But Sunderland's home form is still so impressive, and it would be a major turn-up if they dropped points here.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Francesca's prediction: The Sunderland fans always seem to make a difference. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

The outcome of week 23 went down to the last of the 10 games before Chris clinched his first weekly win of 2026.

Going into Everton's match against Leeds on Monday, he was on 70 points, with his guest, Saipan star Ãanna Hardwicke, on 40 points and the BBC readers and AI on 30 apiece.

Chris and the BBC readers both correctly went for a 1-1 draw but Hardwicke and AI had both backed Everton to win, 3-1 and 2-1, and an exact score would have seen them either overtake Chris or tie with him.

That meant Chris ended up with five correct results, including two exact scores, for as total of 110 points.

The BBC readers managed four correct results with one exact score, leaving them with 70 points.

Hardwicke got four correct results with no exact scores, for 40 points, with AI bringing up the rear this time with 30 points, thanks to three correct results and no exact scores.

For the tables below, outright weekly wins take precedence over ties and total points - and always have done, not just because that's the only way Chris would be on top at the moment!

Experts revealed that Dave King says Rangers takeover discussions have been going on for six months

Former Rangers chairman Dave King believes there's a "a 90% probability" of the club's proposed takeover by American investors going ahead.

A consortium involving Andrew Cavenagh and 49ers Enterprises Global Football Group aim to buy up a 51% share of the Ibrox club.

"I would say that there's probably a 90% probability it will happen," Rangers' largest shareholder King told TalkSport.

"These discussions have been going on for a long time, six months.

"In terms of legals being signed, in terms of the type of conditions present that still have to be fulfilled, I would certainly put it at above 90% right now.

"I can't see anything that would stop the deal happening now."

49ers Enterprises own Leeds United, who have won the Championship to return to the Premier League after a two-year absence, and is the investment wing of the 49ers NFL franchise.

And King, who says mid-June is a realistic timescale for completion of the deal, commented: "The situation regarding Leeds, as I understand it, is not going to be a distraction from Rangers.

"With Rangers you don't have the yo-yo risk. No disrespect to Leeds. At least when they come into Rangers, they know if they make an investment that European football is pretty much assured.

"It's difficult to envisage Rangers or Celtic not being first or second so European football in various stages will be there.

"And I think it's easier to put the financial plan to support the football planning a club like Rangers than it is for someone like Leeds United, where I think it's a lot more challenge.

"As exciting as it is for them to be going up to the Premier League, they're going to have to make a lot of budgeting decisions to stay there."

The Ibrox side will finish second in the this season's Scottish Premiership, with Celtic having secured a fourth successive title and an course for a domestic treble.

Europa League quarter-finalists Rangers will enter the Champions League at the second qualifying round stage.

"I don't think we're two or three players away from challenging for the league title," King added.

"I think there's a lot more than that has to come in if we're going to have a financial plan that's going to support the football plan."

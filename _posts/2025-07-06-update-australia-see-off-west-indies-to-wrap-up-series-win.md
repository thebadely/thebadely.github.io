It has been recently reported that Mitchell Starc took three wickets in the second innings

Second Test, Grenada (Day 4 of 5)

West Indies 253 & 143: Starc 3-24, Lyon 3-42

Australia beat West Indies by 133 runs and lead three-Test series 2-0

Australia clinched a series win over West Indies with a resounding victory in the second Test in Grenada.

After setting the home side 277 to win on a difficult pitch, the tourists ripped through the West Indies batters in 34.3 overs to take an unassailable 2-0 series lead.

Having wrapped up the first Test inside three days in Barbados with a 159-run victory, Australia enjoyed a similar winning margin on day four in Grenada, by 133 runs.

They can complete a series clean sweep when the two sides meet in Jamaica next week.

Day four started with Shamar Joseph (4-66) and namesake Alzarri Joseph (2-52) cleaning up the Australia tail inside 45 minutes.

But on a pitch offering the bowlers plenty, chasing 277 for victory was always going to be a daunting task for West Indies.

And so it proved once John Campbell fell leg before for a duck in the second over off the bowling of Josh Hazlewood (2-33).

Mitchell Starc had Keacy Carty caught for 10 for the first of his three wickets, while opener Kraigg Brathwaite was also caught off the bowling of Beau Webster for seven to leave West Indies 29-3.

The home side were then four down at lunch as Pat Cummins dismissed Brandon King for 14.

Shai Hope (34) and captain Roston Chase (17) provided some resistance in the afternoon session before both fell to Hazlewood and Starc respectively.

Starc then dismissed Justin Greaves for two before brief fireworks from Shamar Joseph (24) and Alzarri Joseph (13) - hitting five sixes between them - were brought to an end by Nathan Lyon's spin.

Lyon then removed Jayden Seales to wrap up the win and end with figures of 3-42.

It also leaves him on 562 Test wickets - just one behind Glenn McGrath's 563 and second on the list of Australia's all-time Test wicket-takers.

The late, great Shane Warne remains out in front with 708 Test wickets. 

"The wickets have been challenging in this series so far but they have also been a lot of fun to play on because Test cricket can be a grind," said Australia's Alex Carey, who was named man of the match.

"It was always a challenging task but you have to believe," West Indies skipper Chase said.

"The guys have to try and stay confident and keep believing in themselves."

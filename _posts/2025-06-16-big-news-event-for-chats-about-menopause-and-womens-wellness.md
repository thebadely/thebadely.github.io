It has been recently reported that Women will be able to speak to medical specialists about issues such as the menopause, sexual health and mental health at a free event next month.

The two-hour session is due to take place at the Penn Manor Medical Practice, an NHS GP surgery in Wolverhampton, from 10:00 BST on 5 July.

GP Shivaleela Bailwad will lead the event which organisers said was aimed at women aged from 18 to 70 and no booking was needed.

Experts are due to speak at the session and those who attend will be able to ask them questions.

"So many women suffer in silence with issues that impact their quality of life," Ms Bailwad, from The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said.

"This event is about breaking those barriers, offering expert insights and ensuring every woman knows that support is available."

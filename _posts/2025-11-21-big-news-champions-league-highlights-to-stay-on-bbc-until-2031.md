Let's dive into the details: The Champions League features 36 clubs with each side playing eight different teams in the league phase

The BBC has retained the rights to broadcast highlights of the men's Champions League for a further four seasons until the end of the 2030-31 campaign. 

Highlights from Europe's elite club competition have been available on the BBC since the 2024-25 season as part of a three-year deal.

Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, said: "The Champions League is the pinnacle of European club football and we're delighted to be providing a free-to-air option for fans who want to see every goal and moment that matters. 

"This deal continues our game-changing football portfolio and ensures audiences can enjoy the very best coverage across BBC TV, iPlayer, Sounds, radio, and digital platforms."

Highlights will continue to be shown from 22:00 on the Wednesday of match weeks on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, with clips also available online and on social media.

A Match of the Day programme will also be broadcast on BBC One after the news on Wednesday nights. 

The show, which can also be watched on iPlayer, will bring viewers all the goals, reaction and analysis from that week's Champions League fixtures.

The BBC Sport website and app will also provide comprehensive coverage of the competition through live text coverage, news, reports and in-depth analysis, while BBC Radio 5 Live will continue to have live commentary of selected matches.

The extended Champions League deal complements the BBC's existing domestic football rights which include Premier League highlights and live FA Cup coverage.

It comes as US media giant Paramount won the rights to show Champions League matches in the UK for four years from 2027.

The BBC's football portfolio also features the men's and women's World Cups, Men's Euro 2028,  the Women's Super League and the Women's Champions League.

BBC Sport's wider portfolio also includes the Olympic Games, Wimbledon Championships, The Open, Six Nations and rugby league's Super League.

GB win silver in first-ever European gymnastics mixed team event

Great Britain's Jake Jarman and Ruby Evans combined to win silver in the first mixed team event at the European Gymnastics Championships in Leipzig.

The 23-year-old Jarman, who won gold on Tuesday night as part of the men's team, delivered on the high bar, while teenager Evans shone on the beam.

Jarman said: "That was great. Tactically we knew going with our strongest apparatus second gave us a good chance for a medal and the plan worked out perfectly.

"It was the perfect scenario this time round so we made the right choice and we're both super happy to have won the silver medal.

"It was great to have men's and women gymnastics combine. I think the competition worked really well and it's exciting for the future."

Germany's Timo Eder and Karina Schoenmaier took the title title on home soil, with Manila Esposito and Lorenzo Casali of Italy winning bronze.

Less than a 10th of a point separated the top two teams with GB's 25.466 seeing them pipped by Germany in the head-to-head final.

Evans, 18, added: "The crowd was amazing, Jake helped calm me and we both really enjoyed it. I'm so proud of us both and really happy with this medal."

Leipzig saw the first mixed team final to take place in a major artistic gymnastics event before its introduction to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.

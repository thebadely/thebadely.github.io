Here’s what you need to know: Iain Henderson (left) was a key omission from Andy Farrell's squad but Nathan Doak  (right) has been named

Andy Farrell has named his 37-man squad for the Six Nations and, as ever, it has generated plenty of discussion.

From a new-look front row to first call-ups for Nathan Doak and Edwin Edogbo, there is a fresh feel to Ireland's squad.

Ireland won the Triple Crown last year but fell short in their bid for three titles in a row, and will be looking to put pressure on favourites France and England.

BBC Sport NI and former Ireland back row Stephen Ferris look at the biggest talking points from the squad.

The talking points from Ireland's Six Nations squad

This time last year, Ulster's form had nosedived and that was reflected in the 2025 Six Nations squad, when only three players were selected. 

But Richie Murphy's young squad have had a resurgent season and sit third in the United Rugby Championship having topped their Challenge Cup pool.

With that in mind, seven players have been named in Farrell's squad for the upcoming Six Nations. 

Doak is one of two uncapped players in the squad, while Stuart McCloskey, Robert Baloucoune and Jacob Stockdale are included in the backs.

In the forward pack, Tom Stewart, Tom O'Toole and Nick Timoney have been rewarded for their form.

However, there was no place for in-form wing Zac Ward, Cormac Izuchukwu or stalwart Iain Henderson, while Bryn Ward will train with the squad in Portugal before the tournament.

"It's been a pretty barren spell for Ulster players over the past couple of seasons," said former Ireland flanker Ferris.

"But with renewed energy, their performance has been unbelievable over the last three or four months and Richie Murphy has got a lot out of his players. 

"Looking at the squad, I thought there might have been one or two more faces but hopefully a few of those selected will get a run over the next few weeks."

Nathan Doak has played a key role in Ulster's upturn in form this season

Doak had spoken of his desire to play for Ireland and is one of those who have been rewarded for their strong form. 

The 25-year-old will likely be the third-choice scrum-half behind Jamison Gibson-Park and Craig Casey, but will finally get the chance to impress in the senior Ireland set-up.

Ferris believes it is a "huge opportunity" for Doak, who has made the second most kick metres in the United Rugby Championship this season, with 1,840m, and is the third-highest URC points scorer with 65.

Doak pipped Leinster's Luke McGrath plus Connacht duo Caolin Blade and Ben Murphy to selection.

"I think he's been excellent this season. Last season he had his critics, he was almost a villain for the fans last year because of how much John Cooney [who has since moved to Brive in France] was a favourite," Ferris said.

"In fairness to Nathan Doak, he has proven a lot of people wrong, hasn't he?

"His performances have been exceptional and he's rightly been rewarded with a call-up. That's only going to excel his game even more."

Hugo Keenan has not played for Leinster or Ireland since the British and Irish Lions tour but has stepped up his training programme

Farrell will be without a number of key players through injury, including Andrew Porter, Mack Hansen, Ryan Baird, Robbie Henshaw and Paddy McCarthy.

For those named in the squad, Hugo Keenan, Ciaran Frawley, Jamie Osborne, Tadhg Furlong and Finlay Bealham have all recently been injured and will be lacking match minutes.

Particularly at prop, Michael Milne, Jack Boyle and Jeremy Loughman have all been handed opportunities as Ireland's strength and depth is tested. 

"We'll soon find out over the next few weeks if these guys are up for the challenge. I think that's what Andy Farrell wants to find out," Ferris said.

"He knows he can rely on the familiar faces who have helped Irish rugby get to a certain point, but to win a Rugby World Cup you don't need 23 good players, you need 33. 

"So let's see if they can build on that."

Edwin Edogbo has been a standout performer in a difficult run for Munster

While Henderson is a notable omission, he is not the only big name missing from last year's Six Nations squad. 

The injuries to key players like Porter, Henshaw and Baird are a blow, while Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray have all retired. 

The average caps of last year's squad under interim head coach Simon Easterby was 44.1. 

This year, that has fallen to 28.4 as Farrell returns following his stint with the British and Irish Lions.

In terms of Henderson, Ferris added that there was "young blood snapping at the heels" of the Ulster second row, but he believes the 33-year-old could have a role to play in the wider squad with his experience.

Munster's Edogbo will add an exciting presence for the forward pack, while Tom Ahern and Cian Prendergast are also exciting options.

"Is this the changing of the guard? Is this Andy Farrell wanting to bring in some of the younger guys?" Ferris said.

"They might be some of the guys he wants to call upon at the next World Cup."

Farrell said Ireland know they have "to hit the ground running" in Paris on 5 February.

"The squad has evolved over the last 18 months, with 12 players making their international debuts over the last year alone, and I know how keen this group is to make its mark for Ireland," he said.

Ireland won the Triple Crown in 2025 but had to settle for third place in the overall table

Ireland won the Triple Crown in 2025 but had to settle for third place in the table behind champions France and England.

Farrell's side open their bid to regain the title in Paris on 5 February, and then host Italy and travel to England.

They finish their campaign at home to Wales and Scotland.

Ferris does not believe the current Ireland squad, with so many familiar faces ruled out, will win the title but he hopes it will help future-proof the squad.

"If you go away from home against France and England, you almost need your full deck to pick from," he said.

"They might cause an upset, whether that's in the first game or in the game against England, we'll wait and find out. 

"They'll have to dig deep. Can they win the Six Nations? I don't think they beat France or England to a Six Nations title this year, but as long as you get to a semi-final of a Rugby World Cup then who cares?".

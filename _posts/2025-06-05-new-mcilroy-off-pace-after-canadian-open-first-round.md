Cristobal Del Solar narrowly missed shooting a 59 in the opening round of the Canadian Open as Rory McIlroy ended the day 10 off the pace.

Chile's Del Solar birdied 10 of his first 16 holes but a bogey on the 17th checked his progress and he missed a 15-foot birdie putt on the last to take the outright lead.

Instead, Del Solar, who was the first player to shoot a 57 in a PGA Tour-sanctioned event on the Korn Ferry Tour in February 2024, ended on nine under par in Ontario, alongside Thorbjorn Olesen.

The Dane had an eagle on the 18th to add to eight birdies and an eagle.

McIlroy hit three birdies but four bogeys - including on his final two holes - as he posted a one-over 71.

"I actually felt like I played OK," said the two-time winner of this event.

"It was my first outing with a new driver, and I felt like that went pretty well. 

"I hit some good iron shots, missed a couple of greens and didn't get them up and down, especially those last couple holes. 

"Overall, I'm pretty happy with how I played. I need to go a little bit lower [on Friday] and over the weekend to have a chance."

Irishman Shane Lowry carded a promising 64 to end the first round on six under, while defending champion Robert MacIntyre, of Scotland, and English pair Danny Willett and Paul Waring are at five under.

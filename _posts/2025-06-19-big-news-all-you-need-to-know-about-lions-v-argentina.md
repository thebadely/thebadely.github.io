It has been recently reported that The British and Irish Lions will play in Ireland for the first time when they face Argentina on Friday in Dublin

The British and Irish Lions kick off their 2025 tour against Argentina in Dublin on Friday.

It will be the first match the Lions have played in Ireland and one of six warm-up games they will play ahead of the three-match Test against Australia.

After the game against the Pumas, the Lions will fly to Perth and meet Western Force on 28 June with the first Test against Australia taking place in Brisbane on 19 July.

From Argentina's form, to team news and how to follow the game on BBC Sport - here's all you need to know.

The Lions face Argentina on Friday 20 June, at a sold-out Aviva Stadium in Dublin with kick-off set for 20:00 BST.

You can follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app, with build-up starting from 19:00 BST. There will also be plenty of reaction and analysis. 

Make sure to follow BBC Sport's dedicated British and Irish Lions page.

The game is being shown live on Sky Sports, S4C and TG4.

Argentina are ranked fifth in the world and took three wins from their six matches in last year's Rugby Championship.

They have beaten three of the four teams above them in the past 12 months.

Ireland, the only higher-ranked team to avoid recent defeat against Argentina, were pushed all the way in November in their most recent visit to Dublin's Aviva Stadium, as they dug out a 22-19 win. 

Argentina were beaten 37-23 by France in their last outing which also took place in November.

After the game in Dublin, Argentina will face England in Two test games in La Plata on 5 July and San Juan on 12 July.

Argentina were also the Lions' warm-up opponents in 2005 when they held Sir Clive Woodward's side to a 25-25 draw in Cardiff.

Scotland's Sione Tuipulotu and Ireland's Bundee Aki will form the centre partnership for the Lions.

Glasgow's Tuipulotu, who missed the Six Nations through injury, will be playing his first international rugby since Scotland's win over Australia in November and will pair up with Aki - despite both players appearing to be more natural inside centres.

Head coach Andy Farrell is still without the majority of those who featured in domestic finals last week, with Leinster hooker Ronan Kelleher - who is named on the bench - the only player to feature for their club side who will be on show at the Aviva.

Tour captain Maro Itoje will lead the side for the first time while 14 of the 23-man squad will be representing the Lions for the first time.

For Argentina, hooker Julian Montoya will captain the Pumas, six days after losing the Premiership final with Leicester.

Santiago Carreras, who will move to Bath from Gloucester this summer, is at full-back with Tomas Albornoz at fly-half.

Saracens flanker Juan Martin Gonzalez is part of a back row completed by the experienced Pablo Matera and Perpignan number eight Joaquin Oviedo.

The Pumas are without several of their France-based players with Toulouse's versatile back Juan Cruz Mallia and Bordeaux-Begles second row Guido Petti involved in the Top 14 play-offs.

Prop Thomas Gallo is also absent.

British and Irish Lions: Marcus Smith; Tommy Freeman, Sione Tuipulotu, Bundee Aki, Duhan van der Merwe; Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell; Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Finlay Bealham, Maro Itoje, Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry, Jac Morgan, Ben Earl.

Lions head coach Andy Farrell: "You can tell with the excitement around the group, it shows what it means to them, we have seen it in how diligent they have been and how quickly they have come together as a group and the bond they have in such a short space of time.

"It is great to see, but it is best foot forward and all about the performance on Friday night because that is how we are all going to get judged, we want to do the shirt proud and represent the group properly."

Argentina head coach Felipe Contepomi: "We haven't been together for seven months and now getting together with lots of new faces it has been a challenge, but the guys have been magnificent.

"They are training with a lot of intensity, we are very pleased with how they adapted.

"We expect the best of the best from the British Isles, we know all their players and we expect them to be playing hard."

Let's dive into the details: The locations of the Pizza Hut restaurants and delivery sites to close across the UK have been revealed.

Some 1,210 people will be made redundant as 68 restaurants in places including Brighton, Hull, Bristol, Leeds and Edinburgh shut their doors in the coming weeks.

Eleven delivery outlets will also close as part of the administration.

Administrators were appointed  to DC London Pie Limited, which operates Pizza Hut's UK restaurants on Monday, while the global brand owner Yum! Brands stepped in to save the remaining 64 pizza restaurants and 1,276 jobs.

Pizza Hut is well-known for its family-friendly dining and salad bar, but its UK business has been struggling and had previously gone into administration less than a year ago.

Administrators FTI Consulting said DC London Pie had been hit by the combination of "challenging trading conditions and increased costs". Cashflow had come under pressure "as a result of tax-related obligations".

"The joint administrators will continue to work with employees who have unfortunately been made redundant, to ensure they get the support needed," joint administrator Matt Callaghan said in a statement on Tuesday.

DC London Pie had bought Pizza Hut UK's restaurants from insolvency in January this year. The company also owns Pizza Hut franchises in Sweden and Denmark.

Alongside the newly acquired 64 pizza restaurants, Yum! Brands still owns and operates 343 Pizza Hut delivery outlets across the UK.

excerpt: "Companies are using AI to do basic coding tasks instead of hiring junior staff."

Let's dive into the details: Eddie Hart studied computer science and cybersecurity at Newcastle University, graduating in 2024.

He says he knew getting into the tech workforce would be a challenge, but "I thought it would be a little easier".

Even when "junior" roles were advertised, they often demanded two or more years professional experience, Mr Hart says.

"It's not realistic, and it's just discouraging the good candidates from even trying."

To him it seems clear that potential employers are using AI tools to automate the simpler parts of coder's work, tasks which would traditionally allow newcomers to build up experience. 

While companies undoubtedly benefit from using AI in some parts of their operations, says Mr Hart, "I don't think replacing developers entirely with AI is sustainable."

ChatGPT, and other coding tools, are being blamed for a collapse in tech job openings, particularly for younger software developers and engineers.

A report by the UK's National Foundation for Education Research showed a 50% decline in tech job adverts between 2019/20 and 2024/25, with entry level roles particularly affected.

The report cited the "anticipated impact of artificial intelligence" as one of the factors behind this.

At the same time, software developers have widely adopted AI code tools, while simultaneously expressing distrust in their output.

Research by Stack Overflow, a software knowledge platform, shows almost half use AI tools daily, despite just one third actually trusting the output of such tools.

Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO of Stack Overflow, says it's "a tricky time to graduate".

More broadly, he says, its research shows developers are choosing to stay put, despite many expressing dissatisfaction with their work. "People are probably running for safety a little bit."

All of this means young technologists are finding it harder to get that critical first job.

The stress of finding a job is also being raised by the use of AI in the job application process.

Mr Hart came across one highly automated application process which had eight stages, the first of which was to answer 20 exam-style questions about himself.

Such exercises can take up hours of time.

Friends had been asked to record and upload answers to interview style questions.

"And then that's just reviewed by AI and a computer makes the decision. It just feels like you don't get that respect of at least being rejected by a human," he says.

Colin, who didn't want his full name to be used, studied computer science at university, graduating in 2024.

He spent almost a year working through the recruitment process for one large company â€“ only to be ultimately unsuccessful.

Even smaller firms often use AI to screen applications, he says, meaning CVs have to structured to be "AI friendly".

Colin would then find he was being interviewed by people "who have clearly not read my CV".

Both Mr Hart and Colin said they knew the senior roles were still out there. But, they wondered, who will fill them if younger developers like them were unable to secure jobs.

Paul Dix, CTO and co-founder at California-based database firm, InfluxData says in any economic downturn or disruption, junior software developers were the ones who got hit hardest.

But he says, "If nobody's hiring younger developers, then you're going to arrive at this point where you don't have senior developers either, because you've completely killed your pipeline."

More positively says Rajiv Ramaswami, CEO of US enterprise cloud firm Nutanix, "Some of these younger folks coming out of college actually have more experience using AI tooling compared to traditional ways of programming."

Ramaswami adds: "I find the market for talent to be the best we've seen in several years."

Mr Chandrasekar says the industry had always had an "apprenticeship" type model, with a pipeline of young people coming in and working with senior developers.

And, he suggests, executives and companies that had invested heavily in AI tech are under pressure to show some return on that investment. Even if that was by simply cutting back on hiring.

Stack Overflow's research also found that while 64% of developers perceived AI as a threat to their jobs, this was four percentage points down on the previous year.

"They've now seen some of the limitations, where you need humans in the loop," Mr Chandrasekar notes.

Previous tech disruptions had sparked fears that both senior or junior jobs would disappear, says Mr Chandrasekar. But invariably they result in more jobs as people uncover new problems and challenges.

"There's going to be an insatiable appetite for technologists and developers to go and build those things to help solve those problems."

But that spike in demand might not come in time for some of today's graduates.

Mr Hart has  secured a role as a security engineer at UK-based cybersecurity firm Threatspike, which he gained through a very human centred job process.

Meanwhile, Colin has turned his back on tech altogether and is considering a career in the police.

Let's dive into the details: Emma Lamb (left) and Jordan Cox (right) won the top honours at the PCA Awards

England batters Emma Lamb and Jordan Cox have been voted players of the year at the Professional Cricketers' Association Awards.

Lamb, 27, won the women's award after playing a starring role as Lancashire secured both the T20 County Cup and the One-Day Cup to earn an England recall.

Cox, 24, took the men's prize after impressing for Essex to force his way back into England contention, and was also named The Hundred men's player of the year having won the competition with Oval Invincibles.

Cox, who ended his summer by hitting his maiden international fifty in the T20 series against Ireland, took the award ahead of Joe Root, Ed Barnard and Dom Sibley.

"It's an honour - for the players to vote for me, when it's your peers and your team-mates, that really means the world," said Cox.

"I was pleased how I went in all formats and it's nice to get your first ever T20 hundred, that was an amazing evening, but in The Hundred I was consistent, which I really enjoyed.

"I love it, it's my favourite competition and to play at The Oval in front of a packed crowd every single time was very cool."

Lamb scored 1,312 runs in domestic cricket, was the leading run-scorer in the One-Day Cup and averaged 41 for England in one-day internationals.

She beat Nat Sciver-Brunt, Kathryn Bryce and Georgia Elwiss to take the award.

"I'm very surprised to win," said Lamb, who is part of the England squad at the Women's World Cup. "I wasn't expecting it but obviously I'm very happy.

"It's really lovely that my peers have taken the time to recognise my performances this year. It's such an honour to receive this award.

"It's been a very enjoyable 12 months. Lots of highs playing with Lancashire this year and winning two trophies. I was gutted I couldn't be there in the final of the One-Day Cup but it was a special moment watching us win it."

Leicestershire all-rounder Rehan Ahmed, 21, was the voted the PCA men's young player of the year after averaging over 50 with the bat in the County Championship.

The women's young player of the year went to 19-year-old Warwickshire batter Davina Perrin - who scored a stunning 42-ball century for eventual winners Northern Superchargers in The Hundred.

Women's team of the year: Emma Lamb, Suzie Bates, Davina Perrin, Kathryn Bryce (c), Georgia Elwiss, Georgia Adams, Kira Chathli (wk), Mady Villiers, Kate Cross, Eva Gray, Katie Levick.

Men's team of the year: Alex Lees, Haseeb Hammed, Joe Clarke, Jordan Cox, James Coles, Ed Barnard (c), Rehan Ahmed, John Simpson (wk), David Willey, Tom Taylor, Kyle Abbott.

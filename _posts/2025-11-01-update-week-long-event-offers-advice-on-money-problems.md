Experts revealed that People will be able to get advice on handling their finances, including help with gambling problems, at a week-long event in Hull.

Talk Money Week will offer free drop-in sessions at Princes Quay shopping centre.

People can also sign up to get a digital newsletter from Hull City Council with advice about handling money and avoiding frauds and scams.

Council leader Mike Ross said the event was about "helping people feel more confident". 

"Talking about money isn't always easy, but sometimes it absolutely the right thing to do when you need to get the help that is out there," he said.

"It's an event for anyone who would like advice about money, whether that's general budgeting help, or advice on specific issues like problems with gambling, dealing with loan sharks and how to protect from scams."

The event runs from 3 to 7 November and is being held on the third floor of the shopping centre between 11:00 and 15:00 GMT.

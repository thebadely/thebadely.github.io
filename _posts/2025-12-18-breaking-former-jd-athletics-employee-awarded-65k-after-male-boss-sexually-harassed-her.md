Here’s what you need to know: A student who worked as a sales assistant has settled a sexual harassment case against her former employer JD Sports for £65,000. 

Jayla Boyd worked part time in a Belfast store while studying for her A-levels. 

During a shift, Ms Boyd, who was 17 at the time, was slapped on the bottom by a male supervisor and was upset that her employer failed to offer her support after the incident.

In settling the case, JD Sports Fashion PLC acknowledged and apologised for the significant upset to Ms Boyd. It also agreed to liaise with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI), who supported the case, to review its policies.

A JD Sports Fashion plc spokesperson said the individual involved is no longer employed by the company.

In a statement the company said: "This incident occurred in July 2024 and was promptly addressed in line with our policies."

They also apologised to Ms Boyd.

Following the incident, on the same day, Ms Boyd made a report to her manager and was told that CCTV had captured the incident. 

However, the supervisor was allowed to continue to work alongside her for the rest of the shift. 

She said he approached her twice during that time to talk to her and apologised for what he had done, explaining that it was "muscle memory".

Despite raising a complaint of sexual harassment, Ms Boyd claimed that while she made a written statement, she was not formally interviewed about her experience. 

She said she felt upset and distressed that her employer failed to offer her support after the incident, so she used some annual leave to take time away from her job.

Upon her return, she said no return-to-work meeting was arranged. 

Ms Boyd said she was not updated about the investigation or outcome of her complaint. 

"I didn't really ever hear much, I didn't want to ask because I thought it was standard procedure that I was kept out of an investigation... I learned that wasn't really standard procedure and I should have been involved," Ms Boyd told BBC News NI. 

She also believes that her personal information relating to the incident was seen by other staff on a manager's computer.

Ms Boyd experienced further embarrassment during a staff training session when an example involving a woman being slapped on the bottom by a supervisor was discussed. 

She felt certain the example referred to her own experience. 

Ms Boyd later resigned from her job.

"I never expected this to happen to me. The initial incident was embarrassing, but it was made worse because I felt like they were trying to ignore what had happened to me instead of dealing with it properly," Ms Boyd said.

"I had to remain working with this male supervisor after he had sexually harassed me. Everyone deserves to feel safe and supported at work. 

"It took me a long time to understand that it was really serious and I think that came from the stigma around it, I was so worried about what other people thought... because of how people would see me... but now I am so glad I said something," she continued.

"I hope that by speaking out I can give others the confidence to challenge this type of behaviour."

In a statement, Chief Commissioner Geraldine McGahey said a "zero-tolerance approach" by employers to sexual harassment in the workplace "will remind everyone how seriously it will be dealt with should any instances arise". 

"In order to prevent it, employers must ensure that all staff know what behaviour is acceptable, and unacceptable, in the workplace," she added.

"Employers must have clear policies and procedures in place to deal with harassment, and managers must be trained to use them appropriately. This type of behaviour must be investigated thoroughly, with the complaint dealt with sensitively and in a timely manner."

In settling the case, ECNI said JD Sports Fashion PLC "acknowledged and apologised for the significant upset, distress, and injury to feelings experienced by Ms Boyd". 

The company reaffirmed its strong commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity. 

It has also agreed to liaise with the commission to review its policies, practices and procedures, the ECNI added.

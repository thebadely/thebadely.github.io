Those prices are expected to rise as fans bid to get to the game, while all coaches expected to arrive on the Wednesday afternoon have sold out.

The journey - which would take around 24 hours - would begin early morning on Monday from London Victoria, with a change in Paris. The cheapest return journey leaving on Thursday takes 32 hours, arriving back in London early Saturday morning.

Travel expert Simon Calder is a frequent visitor to Bilbao - and typically pays Â£150-Â£200 for a return journey from London.

He told BBC Sport: "There are many other ways to reach Bilbao. In particular, Biarritz in France is well placed for fans who want to see something of the Basque region en route to Bilbao.

"There is a routing via Basel in Switzerland. From Biarritz airport you can walk to the city's rail station in about 20 minutes, and board a train to the border town of Hendaye. From here a narrow-gauge railway runs to San Sebastian, from where there is another narrow-gauge train.

"Supporters who want to travel by train should be able to cover the ground for about Â£200 one way.

"From London St Pancras International on 20 May, the cheapest morning Eurostar train to Paris Nord is Â£110. After crossing the city to Paris Montparnasse, the lunchtime train to the Hendaye costs Â£75. From here, it's those little trains once again.

"The most sedate way to reach Bilbao is the Brittany Ferries sailing from Portsmouth to Bilbao on Sunday, 18 May at 10pm. You get two nights on board for a one-way fare of Â£201. But no cabins are available, so it could be a long, sleepless voyage."

The recommended route to San Mames is via public transport or walking. 

There are several different transport methods to get to the stadium, including underground, train, tram or bus.

San Mames' official website recommends walking, giving fans a 'unique experience' and taking in the sights.

Uefa is yet to update its website on matchday travel for fans.

San Mames is close to to the city centre. To get to the stadium, it is only a 20-minute walk or 9-18 minutes on public transport. 

Hotel prices in the city centre are between Â£2,601 and Â£4,201. 

There are cheaper alternatives about a 35-minute drive away in towns such as Bermeo and Mundaka. Accommodation in the area of Bakio have sold out.

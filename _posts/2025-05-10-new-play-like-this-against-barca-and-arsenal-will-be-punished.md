Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Maya le Tissier (right) celebrates after scoring against Arsenal - the 16th goal the Gunners have conceded in six games across all competitions

Four goals scored, three points earned, second place secured, one huge game left for Arsenal this season.

Renee Slegers' side ensured they will go into their Champions League final against Barcelona on 24 May on the back of a victory, following a topsy-turvy 4-3 win over Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime.

There are reasons to be cheerful for the Gunners, who produced a display of real attacking verve at times against United, scoring three goals in 16 minutes after half-time while having 16 shots in total.

Even against the formidable reigning European champions Barca, who could seal another Liga F domestic title this weekend, Arsenal should be able to pose attacking questions.

Alessia Russo is the joint-winner of the Women's Super League (WSL) Golden Boot with 12 goals, while Arsenal have won their past eight home league matches while scoring four or more goals every time.

But the concerns for Arsenal lie in defence, with 12 goals conceded in their past three WSL matches. Five shipped against Aston Villa, four in defeat by Brighton, then three to almost allow Manchester United back into the game.

The manner of the three United goals will cause concern too. Ella Toone was unmarked to head home and make it 1-1 after 13 minutes.

Then in the second half, with Arsenal seemingly safe three goals to the good, Katie McCabe's dreadful pass square across the back four allowed Elisabeth Terland to score before the Irish defender fouled Celin Bizet to concede a penalty, converted by Maya le Tissier.

"Arsenal opened the door for Man Utd and that door should've been nailed shut at 4-1," former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis told BBC Two. "They know that anything remotely like this against Barcelona and they will be punished.

"It's a win and ticked a few boxes of the objectives that Slegers wanted, which was to finish second and avoid extra games next season - but there will be a lot of analysis before the Barcelona game."

Slegers will have to solve the problem of a defence which has not kept a clean sheet in all competitions since March, against a Barcelona side which has scored 113 goals in 28 league games.

In Europe, Barca have been just as deadly with a remarkable 18 goals in four Champions League knockout ties. After netting 10 over two legs versus Wolfsburg, they put eight past runaway WSL champions Chelsea and could have had more.

Slegers has to find a way to cut out the defensive errors and loss of concentration which allowed United back into the match on Saturday. She also has to find a solution to the goalkeeper situation.

First choice Daphne van Domselaar has not played since the second leg against Lyon, which she featured in after a spell out with an ankle problem.

Her understudy Manuela Zinsberger has not convinced in the Dutchwoman's absence, and Slegers will surely hope her first choice is available for the final.

What is certain is that Slegers will try to tighten up her back line while maintaining the attacking verve which has become Arsenal's trademark since she replaced Jonas Eidevall as manager earlier this season.

As well as Russo finding her shooting boots under Slegers - 12 goals in 20 appearances - winger Chloe Kelly has a new lease of life since joining on loan in January, while attacking midfielder Mariona Caldentey must rank as one of the signings of the season as she prepares to face former club Barca.

"I felt like Arsenal let Man Utd back in the game towards the end of the first half, but the second half is what we've come to expect with the high press and finishing," former Gunners player Fara Williams told BBC Two.

"Then the lapse of concentration is something they can't afford to do in the Champions League final in a few weeks' time.

"Slegers will be happy to have a rest and then they have two weeks to prepare for the biggest game in the club's history since 2006."

The Arsenal players gave no indication of wanting to give up on their attacking outlook for the final.

"We showed in the final third today we were great," Kelly told the BBC. "We've got a lot of training in our legs to get through to be ready for the final."

Arsenal captain Kim Little added: "The most important thing is to communicate and make sure you're fluid. When we do that well, we're at our best.

"That is part of our game - we are one of the teams that are in the press the most. Against Barcelona, they are one of the best teams in the world so we'll have to take that into consideration."

Manchester United meanwhile are preparing for a major final of their own, as they defend the FA Cup against Chelsea at Wembley next weekend.

Marc Skinner's side are winless in four, with two draws plus defeats by the Blues and Arsenal - the two sides above them in the WSL - to round out an uneven league campaign.

"The WSL is done now. The FA Cup final is a different game," Skinner told the BBC. "We had to chase the game, we had to win it if we were going to finish second.

"We'll have a plan against Chelsea. I just think it'll be a completely different game."

"We know what it takes to play in the FA Cup - we've got all week to prepare ourselves," added Toone. "It's a final so anything can happen."

Both Arsenal and United will start as underdogs in their respective finals. If they can bring the same attacking prowess they showed on Saturday, they could both cause an upset.

But if they show the same defensive frailties, they could be in for a couple of bruising experiences on the biggest stages.

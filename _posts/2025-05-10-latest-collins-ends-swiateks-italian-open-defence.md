According to new developments, Iga Swiatek had lost just once in her previous 22 matches at the Italian Open 

American Danielle Collins completed a comprehensive straight-set victory over defending champion Iga Swiatek in the third round of the Italian Open. 

Collins capitalised on a poor serving display from world number two Swiatek to cruise to the opening set before battling back from a break down in the second to clinch a 6-1 7-5 victory.

It was just her second win in nine matches against the five-time Grand Slam champion and first on clay - the 23-year-old Pole's preferred surface.  

Collins, 31, will face Ukrainian Elina Svitolina in the fourth round, while Swiatek must now regroup before the French Open, which begins on 25 May.

The five-time Grand Slam champion had won the Italian Open in three of the past four seasons but struggled for her best form in the run-up to this year's event in Rome. 

Swiatek has not won a WTA tournament since claiming her fourth French Open women's singles title in five years at Roland Garros 12 months ago. 

She started poorly, serving double faults when facing break point in her first two service games, and lost her third to love as 29th seed Collins raced into a 5-0 lead.

Swiatek finally got on the board in the sixth game, but was promptly broken for a fourth time to lose the opening set in just 24 minutes.

She broke Collins in the opening game of the second set, but was again unable to cement the break. 

Collins battled hard to keep on level terms for the remainder of the second set before pouncing in the 12th game, claiming a sixth break of serve in the match to seal victory with her second match point as Swiatek flashed a backhand wide. 

Collins' next opponent, 16th seed Svitolina, came through a three-set battle with 23-year-old American Hailey Baptiste, beating the world number 90 6-4 3-6 6-4.

Elsewhere, Italian number one Jasmine Paolini - the sixth seed - got past an out-of-sorts Ons Jabeur 6-4 6-3 to seal a place in the last 16, where she will meet 17th seed Jelena Ostapenko, of Latvia.

Fifth seed Madison Keys lost to fellow American Peyton Stearns in another shock, with the Australian Open champion edged out in a final-set tie-breaker. 

Stearns will play Japan's Naomi Osaka, who battled back from a set down to beat Czech player Marie Bouzkova.

Russian Diana Shnaider beat Jaqueline Cristian and awaits Belgium's Elise Mertens, who beat American third seed Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-1.

Elsewhere, in the men's tournament, Britain's Jacob Fearnley was beaten 6-4 7-6 (7-0) by Italian 29th seed Matteo Berrettini.

It has been recently reported that Taulupe Faletau has been on three tours with the British and Irish Lions

Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau is set to miss the start of the Six Nations after suffering a calf injury playing for Cardiff.

Faletau, 35, only recently returned from the knee injury which forced him to miss the autumn internationals in November 2025.

The British and Irish Lion played a part in three United Rugby Championship (URC) derbies over the festive period and scored a try in the New Year's Day defeat against Ospreys.

Faletau, who has won 109 caps for Wales, last played for his country in the first Test defeat against Japan in July 2025.

The number eight will miss Cardiff's two remaining Challenge Cup games against Racing 92 and Exeter and the URC matches with Benetton and Ulster.

"I think he might miss the start of it, but I'm pretty confident he will be available during the Six Nations for selection," said Blue and Blacks coach Corniel van Zyl.

Faletau, who is set to be out of contract with Cardiff in the summer, also missed the start of the season with a calf strain.

Wales' number eight choices in the autumn squad included Aaron Wainwright, Olly Cracknell, Taine Plumtree and Morgan Morse, while Ross Moriarty could return to provide another option.

Wales head coach Steve Tandy will name his Six Nations squad later this month with  the tournament opener away against England on 7 February.

Tandy is already without captain Jac Morgan and Gloucester centre Max Llewellyn for at least the first half of the tournament because of injury.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Nadia Nadim took up football at a refugee camp and has earned over 100 caps for Denmark

Denmark forward Nadia Nadim will return to the national team following an 18-month absence after she was named in their 23-player squad for next month's Euro 2025.

Nadim, 37, represented Denmark in the 2022 edition in England but has not played for the country since a Nation's League defeat by Germany in December 2023.

The Afghan-born player spent last season on loan at Swedish side Hammarby and has also played for Manchester City, Paris St-Germain and AC Milan.

Nadim has won more than 100 caps for Denmark and guided them to a runner-up finish in Euro 2017 - scoring in a 4-2 defeat by the Netherlands in the final.

"We see Nadia as a player capable of making a difference for us," Denmark head coach Andree Jeglertz told public television network DR.

"She also has experience in major tournaments, which I believe could be valuable for the squad."

A medical graduate, Nadim fled Afghanistan with her mother and four sisters when she was 11 after her father was executed by the Taliban.

The Denmark squad is headlined by captain and former Chelsea forward Pernille Harder while Crystal Palace defender Katrine Veje and identical twins Sara and Karen Holmgaard, both playing for Everton, are also called up. 

The Danes are pooled with Germany, Poland and Sweden in Group C of Euro 2025, which will be held in Switzerland from July 2 to 27.

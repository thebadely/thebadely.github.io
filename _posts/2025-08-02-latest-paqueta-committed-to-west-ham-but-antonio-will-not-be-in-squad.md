Experts revealed that Michail Antonio (left) joined West Ham in 2015, while Lucas Paqueta (right) joined in 2022

West Ham manager Graham Potter says midfielder Lucas Paqueta is committed to the club after he was cleared of spot-fixing charges â but Michail Antonio will not be in his squad this season.

Almost two years after the Football Association began its investigation into the Brazil international, Paqueta was cleared of getting booked deliberately to affect a betting market.

The 27-year-old had been facing a lifetime ban.

At the time the FA began its investigation, Paqueta had been heavily linked with a move to Manchester City.

With the transfer window not closing until 1 September, there is some nervousness among West Ham fans that the playmaker might be lured away.

Potter though looks at the situation more positively.

"You never know for sure because anything can happen in the window with anybody," said Potter at a media conference in Atlanta to look ahead to his side's Premier League Summer Series match with Bournemouth on Sunday.

"But the news is incredibly positive. If it had gone the other way, there would have been a whole other line of questions.

"Lucas is happy and committed. He is an important person in dressing room and at the club and we love him. We just want to help him enjoy his football.

"You can imagine on a personal level for him, having to fight those allegations was an incredible challenge for him. It has been a really tough period in his life and career.

"It is a credit to him and his family and everyone who has supported him that he has come through."

As the written reasons are yet to be published, it is still not known whether Paqueta will take legal action against the FA.

Meanwhile, Antonio looks to be surplus to Potter's plans.

Asked whether the 35-year-old would be part of his squad for the forthcoming campaign following the signing of another veteran frontman â and Antonio's former podcast partner â Callum Wilson on a free transfer, Potter said simply: "No."

Last month, the club said no formal decision had been made on the player whose contract expired at the end of the month.

"As a long-serving, highly-respected player, and a much-loved member of the West Ham family, the club's absolute priority at this time is to support Michail personally in his journey to resume playing at the highest level," said a statement.

There had been no update on that prior to Potter's answer.

Having recovered from his horrific car crash in December, Antonio made a playing return for Jamaica during this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.

He joined West Ham from Nottingham Forest for an undisclosed fee, reported to be Â£7m, in 2015 and is the club's record Premier League goalscorer, scoring 68 goals in 268 top-flight appearances.

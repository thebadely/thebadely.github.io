Experts revealed that Reports on Tuesday had suggested an announcement on Tate's involvement in a Misfits show could be made on Saturday

The controversial British-American social media personality Andrew Tate is not in talks to fight on a Misfits Boxing card, BBC Sport understands.

Combat sports media outlet Uncrowned, external reported that talks had reached a "serious stage" for a boxing match, and that an announcement could be made at Saturday's Misfits show.

Misfits Boxing, co-founded by YouTuber and fighter KSI, has gained a reputation for staging high-profile crossover events featuring professional fighters and internet personalities.

Tate, 38, is facing several serious legal challenges around the world that he is fighting, in some of which he is accused along with his brother Tristan Tate.

Four women in the UK are suing Tate over allegations of sexual violence, including that he grabbed one of the women by the throat on several occasions in 2015, pointed a gun in her face and assaulted her with a belt.

Tate has previously denied the claims in a written defence submitted to the High Court, calling them a "pack of lies" and "gross fabrications".

In Romania, the brothers are facing criminal charges including human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering, while Andrew Tate also faces allegations of rape.

They are also under criminal investigation in the US state of Florida.

Despite the ongoing legal cases, reports have suggested that event organisers see value in Tate's public profile and combat sports background.

He was a recent guest at UFC 313 and a Power Slap event in the US in March, greeted personally by close Donald Trump ally, Dana White.

A four-time world kickboxing champion - he won three titles with ISKA, external and one with Dutch promotion Enfusion - Tate rose to wider notoriety through his online presence. 

Misfits has an event on Saturday in Manchester, headlined by ex-UFC fighters Darren Till and Luke Rockhold. 

Neither Tate nor his representatives have publicly commented on his rumoured involvement with Misfits.

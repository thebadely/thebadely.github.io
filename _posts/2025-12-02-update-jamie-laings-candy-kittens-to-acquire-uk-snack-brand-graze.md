Experts revealed that British TV personality Jamie Laing's vegan sweets brand Candy Kittens is set to acquire snack company Graze in a deal between the former's parent company and packaged goods giant Unilever.

The upcoming deal with German firm Katjes International, Candy Kittens' parent company, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026 for an undisclosed sum.

The sale of Graze, a popular nuts and snack bar brand in the UK, marks Unilever's latest effort to offload under-performing brands in its line-up.

Unilever said on Monday that it will focus on condiments and other packaged products to "sharpen" its catalogue of goods, which will mean "pruning the portfolio where relevant".

Graze was founded in 2005 as an internet-based snack delivery service selling healthy and often nut-based treats. It gradually began to sell in supermarkets and retailers.

In 2019, it was acquired by Unilever, reportedly for around £100m ($132m), but has under-performed, with sales falling in recent years.

Now, its future will be "better realised under new ownership" by Katjes and Laing's Candy Kittens Group, given their expertise in consumer goods, said Unilever in its statement.

Laing said that Graze has changed the way the UK thinks about healthier snacking and is "perfect" for Candy Kittens' plans for growth.

Laing has hosted programmes on the BBC and is known for his participation in the reality show Made in Chelsea and Strictly Come Dancing.

The deal is a "massive moment" for his eco-conscious firm, which sells vegan treats, Laing said online.

"When we started out, the thought of a company like Unilever buying our business was the dream. Today we're the ones buying a business from them. The tables have turned," he said.

Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello told BBC News that Graze had become "a bit of a money sink" for Unilever so it was not surprising that the brand was being spun off.

"Unilever had originally planned the acquisition of Graze as a way of increasing their share of the DTC [direct-to-consumer] market, but this market has shrunk considerably in favour of traditional product purchasing, i.e. supermarkets," Mr De Mello said.

He added that "a more hands-on approach" could benefit Graze, which a smaller business like Candy Kittens could provide.

Profit margins for snack bars have fallen in recent years as the cost of cocoa, wheat and nuts has climbed rapidly.

Unilever chief executive Fernando Fernandez outlined plans to divest the firm's food brands as part of efforts to fund the company's turnaround, after he stepped into the role in March.

Among the other food brands the UK-based consumer goods giant has sold off this year is The Vegetarian Butcher. It acquired cosmetics companies like Wild.

The Marmite- and Dove soap-owner is also set to spin off its ice cream division which carries well-known brands like Magnum, Ben & Jerry's and Walls as part of its overhaul.

Jonny Forsyth, food and drink principal strategist at market research firm Mintel, said the deal "stretches Candy Kittens from indulgence into healthy snacks – the latter will experience significant growth over the next decade".

He said Graze's direct-to-consumer model was "central" to its brand identity, but Unilever's decision to scrap this led to the company "being overtaken by rivals, including supermarket own label products".

Here’s what you need to know: Gabriel Hamer-Webb spent two seasons at Cardiff but missed out for Wales selection during that spell

Gabriel Hamer-Webb has revealed how family grief led to him picking Wales over England for his international future.

The Bath-born wing has already represented England at Under-20s level in the Six Nations.

But he was convinced to switch allegiance by his Cardiff-born mother following the tragic loss of both his father and brother.

"That loss definitely taught me a lot. I've only tried to see silver linings and even though it's tragic and sudden, you can't control or change it," said Hamer-Webb.

"The losses meant that I'm a sole male figure in my instant family. That weight brings pressure but I would do anything for my sisters and my mum anyway.

"So I asked my mum a while back, 'What would be better for you?' She said, 'Wales of course, that's where we're from, where your family is from'.

"That was big for me. If that's the thing that makes my mother the proudest, then wow, that could be something."

It made his first Wales squad selection all the more emotional.

His shock at the phone call from Steve Tandy only felt like reality once he had broken the news to his family.

"It didn't really sink in [but] then I called my mum and sisters and that's when it was much more exciting, seeing their reactions, especially my mother's. I've got a screenshot of her crying which will go up on the fridge.

"Seeing them be proud and their reaction meant more to me than anything else."

Still only 25, Hamer-Webb has still had to wait for his chance having come through the ranks at Bath before spells in New Zealand with Southland and at Northampton Saints.

His decision to pursue Test honours with Wales prompted a move to Cardiff but he was overlooked by Warren Gatland despite several impressive club displays.

His frustration will have been heightened by watching former England Under-20 team-mates Freddie Steward and Jack van Poortvliet progress to the international arena. 

Ironically it was his move out of Wales, to Leicester Tigers, that has seen him picked for the Six Nations squad, ahead of Test regular Rio Dyer.

"It's taken a long while but you always have that hunger to push to get capped," he said.

"I've always been after it and now the opportunity is finally arising. It's a real sweet moment."

Hamer-Webb celebrated the call with a try in Leicester's victory over Harlequins on Saturday, but knows the hard work starts now if he is to force his way into the matchday action.

"You're there for a reason but you always have that pressure of a new environment and you have to earn the respect of a new group," said Hamer-Webb, one of only two uncapped players in the squad that gathers for the first time on Monday.

"It's another level. There's a lot more scrutiny and eyes on you in the Six Nations but that's absolutely fine by me."

Wales open their campaign at England on 7 February with the prospect of Hamer-Webb making a dream Test debut opposite his best friend, Bath's Max Ojomoh.

"That would be a moment for life if we played against each other in the Six Nations at Twickenham, one that we'll absolutely savour forever," he said.

"But those are obviously dreams. Just to be involved and do my best for the team - whatever aspect that is - will be enough for me."

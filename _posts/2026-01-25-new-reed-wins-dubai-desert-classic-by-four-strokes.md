American Patrick Reed shot a level-par 72 in his final round to ease to a four-shot victory in the Dubai Desert Classic.

The 35-year-old LIV golfer finished the tournament at 14 under par to claim what was his first Rolex Series victory on the DP World Tour.

Reed, the Masters champion in 2018, started the final round with a four-shot lead over Spaniard and fellow LIV player David Puig, an advantage he maintained in the early going despite not making a birdie across the front nine.

Puig birdied the eighth and ninth to briefly cut into his playing partner's lead, before both birdied the 10th and bogeyed the 11th. 

When the Spaniard bogeyed the 13th, and Reed made his second birdie of the day on the same hole, it was a straightforward finish to the tournament for the former world number six.

"I couldn't really get anything going on the front nine, it was a bit of a grind today," Reed told Sky Sports.

"Instead of putting the foot on the gas early, I was just trying to protect that four-shot lead. I didn't think I hit it that badly, I just couldn't get anything close.

"When you're trying to protect, sometimes instead of looking at flags, you're looking away and then you misjudge the wind and all of a sudden you're 50 feet away. That's kind of what happened."

Reed's final round featured two birdies and two bogeys

Having spent much of the day as Reed's nearest challenger, Puig was given a two-stroke penalty on the 18th for grounding his club in the bunker.

That dropped him into a tie for seventh with Englishman Andy Sullivan, who finished with a pair of birdies, in solo second on 10 under.

After his impressive 65 on Saturday, Norwegian world number 14 Viktor Hovland endured a frustrating final round with a four-over 76 that featured a trio of double bogeys.

That dropped the 28-year-old from third into a tie for 14th, which was still the best finish among his 2025 Ryder Cup team-mates.

Republic of Ireland's Shane Lowry shot a final-round 70 to finish on three under and in a tie for 26th, with world number two Rory McIlroy and England's Tyrrell Hatton one shot and seven places further back.

World number three Tommy Fleetwood shot a 69 on Sunday which was good enough to jump 20 places on the leaderboard and finish in a tie for 41st on one under overall.

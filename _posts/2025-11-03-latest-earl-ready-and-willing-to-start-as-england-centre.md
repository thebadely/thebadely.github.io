It has been recently reported that Ben Earl has scored seven tries in 43 appearances for England

England back row Ben Earl says he would have no qualms about starting a Test match in the centres after being touted for a possible switch into the backline.

Head coach Steve Borthwick floated the possibility of Earl beginning a match in midfield after a string of second-half cameos behind the scrum.

"We've had conversations about it in the past," Earl told Rugby Union Weekly.

"If and when Steve would like me to play there, I'd feel very happy to, because I know he wouldn't do anything to put the team at jeopardy.

"If he thinks that you're ready to go in that position, then you've got to put your trust in him and trust in yourself for the work that you've done previously.

"So yeah, I'd feel happy to at any time."

Earl played at centre for about 30 minutes in England's 68-14 thumping of Wales in the final round of the Six Nations in March, after starting 13 Tommy Freeman was replaced by back row Henry Pollock.

It followed similar mid-game switches for Earl against New Zealand, Japan and Italy.

With Manu Tuilagi out of eligibility after signing for Bayonne in France, Earl could potentially provide a straightforward source of front-foot ball better than any of the midfield specialists in Borthwick's squad.

Earl, 27, believes a move into the centres would not require major changes to his game.

"When you perform well as a 12 or a 13 and when you perform well as a back row, the performance looks very, very similar," he said.

"I think the one occasion that you might be doing something different is literally scrummaging.

"I don't want to be like this sort of trailblazing guy who's done a bit of everything, but I'm just trying to stay true to what I am as a player."

Earl made 73 metres with ball in hand - more than all but two of his team-mates - in Saturday's 25-7 win over Australia. The Saracens star ran in the opening try from just inside the Wallabies half to help himself towards that statistic.

He is not the only forward Borthwick has flagged as having the potential to play in the backs. 

Pollock, who has scored three tries in a little over an hour of Test rugby for England, has been earmarked as a possible wing option.

"I think he's quicker than me," said Earl of Pollock.

"We haven't had a race, and we probably should at some point, but he's certainly up there with the quickest in the squad, never mind with the forwards."

Earl said the experience of playing against the 20-year-old, who has made a huge impact with his exuberant, abrasive style, is a contrast to having him as a team-mate.

"Henry's been tremendous. The way he's bonded - it's like he's known us for years," said Earl.

"I think that's probably his strength - he's just a good, likeable guy when you're in his camp.

"Having played against him about two weeks ago [Northampton's 43-31 win over Saracens] there's no-one I disliked more, but when you're in camp with him he's an absolute bundle of energy. He's someone you want to be around."

England continue their autumn campaign against Fiji on Saturday, before meetings with New Zealand and Argentina at Twickenham.

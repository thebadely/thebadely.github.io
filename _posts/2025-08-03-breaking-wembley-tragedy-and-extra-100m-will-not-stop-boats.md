Experts revealed that The compensation scheme for motorists who were mis-sold car finance is on the front pages for a number of the papers.  The Guardian calls the mis-selling a "scandal" for consumers, and reports that the Financial Conduct Authority will begin consulting on the scheme by October. The paper also quotes Lib Dem MP Bobby Dean as saying that industry "must learn that honesty matters".

Universities will be penalised if they fail to stop study visas being used as a "back door" for entry to the UK, according to the Times. The paper says institutions could face sanctions depending on how many international students start their course or stay until the end. It says that the worst performing universities will be "named and shamed".

The Daily Telegraph reports that thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are planning to attend a demonstration in London on Saturday to back the recently banned group, Palestine Action. The paper describes it as a co-ordinated "plot" by campaigners to confront the criminal justice system "en masse", and to test if the law making it an offence to support the group can be enforced on thousands of people.

Nine times more military veterans have died from the effects of asbestos they've been exposed to during their careers, than during the 20-year campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to government records seen by the Daily Mail.  It says the substance - found in poor military accommodation, ships, submarines or tanks - causes an average of 89 cases of asbestos-related cancer a year; something the paper describes as a "national disgrace". The Ministry of Defence says it takes the health and safety of its service personnel "extremely seriously".

Noel and Liam Gallagher are pictured on the front of the Daily Star which leads on what it calls the "Wembley tragedy" which saw the death of an Oasis fan. The paper reports that the man fell 170 feet from the stadium's upper tier on Saturday night. The Sun also leads with the story, saying the band was "shocked and saddened" by the death.

According to new developments, Rooney was a pitchside pundit for Liverpool's win over Real Madrid

Virgil van Dijk called out Wayne Rooney's "over the top" criticism of him live on air after Liverpool's 1-0 win against Real Madrid on Tuesday.

The Liverpool captain spoke to match broadcasters Amazon Prime after the match, taking questions from pundits, including Rooney.

Last month on the Wayne Rooney Show, the former Manchester United striker criticised the body language of Van Dijk and Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah after a run of four consecutive Premier League defeats.

Van Dijk responded by accusing Rooney of "lazy criticism", before Rooney then doubled down on his comments.

On Tuesday they came face-to-face for the first time since the comments, resulting in slightly awkward encounter.

Here's how it unfolded:

Van Dijk approached the Amazon Prime team pitchside and greeted all the pundits - including Rooney - before standing next to the former England striker.

The interview began with presenter Gabby Logan asking Van Dijk to review the win before Logan then addressed the poor run the Reds had been on, and how important a team meeting after the 2-1 loss to Manchester United on 19 October had been to improving form.

Van Dijk: "It is easy to say now because we won twice in a row that it helped pretty well but in a world of chaos you have to try and stay calm and take perspective of things. In that meeting the time was October, so much football to be played, so many twists and turns that can happen and I think at times the noise was a lot (said with a small smile on his face)."

Logan: "You looking at anybody round here in particular?"

Van Dijk: "No, no not all but listen I think it is very important to put things in perspective, keep your head down and work and get out the situation because the quality we have, that is not the issue. It is about keep working and keep going."

Robbie Fowler: "Does the outside noise affect you or are you just happy plodding along, doing what you need to do and try and put people right?"

Van Dijk: "I think all of you know here you are dealing with a squad of 25 players, a lot of young players and a couple of older players like myself and everyone lives a different life. I can say for me personally it doesn't affect me but as a captain I am dealing with players who may be affected about it."

Logan: "Has some of the criticism been fair, do you think?"

Van Dijk: "Of course, if you lose four or five games in a row as a Liverpool player then it is a fair criticism, that is absolutely normal in that sense. But I think it is over the top at times as well at that point, but that is because we live in a world with so many platforms and so many people can say stuff, it will be picked up and made bigger. I think it is good that ex-players who played at the highest level who dealt with difficult moments as well puts a lot in perspective (said with a smile as Rooney laughs)."

Rooney: "I am not saying anything any more because I think I spurred them on and put them on a winning streak!

"I think what I've said was fair when you win the Premier League and then go on a run where you lose three or four games in a row, which you don't expect from Liverpool over the last few years.

"As Virgil is captain I think that is your opportunity to go and lead the players and that is what I was saying. That happens in football and I think the response has been great from Virgil and the team."

Van Dijk: "I think if you watched games then I would definitely take responsibility. I think the comment that I signed my new deal and then it was like 'that is it' and I let it slide, I think that was a bit... but that's my personal opinion and we move on."

Once the interview was complete, Van Dijk embraced Rooney and the rest of the Amazon Prime team before leaving the set.

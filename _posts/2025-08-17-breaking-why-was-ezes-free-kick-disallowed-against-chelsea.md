The rule that disallowed Eze's free-kick - analysis

Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze thought he had given his side the lead with a well-struck free-kick within the opening 15 minutes of their Premier League match away to Chelsea.

But it wasn't to be as VAR intervened and disallowed the goal, much to the surprise of many.

However, it was the correct decision - let the Ask Me Anything team explain why.

Simply, the goal was chalked off because a Palace player was standing too close to the Chelsea wall.

Referee Darren England made an announcement to the crowd to explain the decision.

He said: "After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free-kick and a disallowed goal."

The International Football Association Board's Law 13 states that when three or more defending team players form a wall, all attacking players must remain at least one metre from the wall until the ball is in play. 

This rule was introduced to the laws of the game in 2019-20.

The explanation at the time was that "attackers standing very close to, or in, the defensive 'wall' at a free-kick often cause management problems and waste time". 

It continued: "There is no legitimate tactical justification for attackers to be in the 'wall' and their presence often damages the image of the game."

And so Eze's goal was disallowed.

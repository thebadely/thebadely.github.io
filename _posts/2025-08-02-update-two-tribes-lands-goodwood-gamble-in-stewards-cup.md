Hereâ€™s what you need to know: David Egan had also won on Two Tribes at Ascot a week earlier

Two Tribes was the well-backed winner of the Stewards' Cup at Glorious Goodwood as he claimed his second victory in a week.

The 11-2 chance, ridden by David Egan for trainer Richard Spencer, had been as big as 18-1 on Friday.

Named after the Frankie Goes to Hollywood 1980s hit by owner Phil Cunningham, Two Tribes had won the International Handicap at Ascot seven days earlier.

Drawn 25 of the 27 runners at Goodwood, he swept clear to triumph by two and a half lengths from Strike Red, with Jakajaro in third.

"He actually did it easier there than he did in the International. Not many horses can do a quick double like that," said Egan, who punched the air after crossing the finishing line.

Spencer also had the fourth and fifth-placed finishers - Run Boy Run and Twilight Calls.

Earlier, Callum Rodriguez rode the Owen Burrows-trained filly Waardah to victory in the Lillie Langtry Stakes.

It was a good end to the five-day meeting for Rodriguez, who was one of five jockeys to miss rides on Thursday after a private plane taking them to Goodwood had to make an emergency landing.

"It was a messy start to the week, but we made sure that we were on four wheels today," said Rodriguez. 

Oisin Murphy was the five-day meeting's leading jockey with six wins.

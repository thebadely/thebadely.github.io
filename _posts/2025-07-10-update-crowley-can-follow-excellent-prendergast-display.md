Experts revealed that Crowley starts against Portugal after being introduced as a 64th-minute substitute in Georgia

Ireland interim head coach Paul O'Connell says Jack Crowley has the opportunity to "follow up" on Sam Prendergast's "excellent" performance in the win over Georgia in Saturday's Test against Portugal. 

With Crowley having started Ireland's final Six Nations game, Prendergast shone on his return to the line-up in Tbilisi, converting all six of his kicks off the tee in a 34-5 Irish win in tough conditions. 

The 22-year-old, who also had what would have been his first international try ruled out, is not included in the matchday squad for this weekend's contest at Estadio Nacional do Jamor in Lisbon with Crowley returning to the 10 jersey. 

"It's a very important position, out-half, I think more and more important in the game than it's ever been," said O'Connell, who has led Ireland's summer tour while head coach Andy Farrell is away with the British and Irish Lions. 

"They probably don't touch the ball as much as the nines, but they probably make more decisions than anyone else on the field and they really decide how we play the game. Having two guys that are confident, that we believe in, that get to get in and play our way and make mistakes and learn and get it right and learn from that as well is really important. 

"It's just an opportunity for Jack to own the week and run it and get after it. It's great for us, the two of them are quite supportive of each other, they learn a lot from each other, so it's just a brilliant opportunity for us to give more experience to Jack."

O'Connell praised Prendergast, who struck 14 points off the tee in Tbilisi 

O'Connell praised Leinster out-half Prendergast's performance and kicking accuracy in the win over Georgia. 

"When you get a lead of more than two scores in those conditions, it's very tough to come from behind we were able to keep them at arm's length with our kicking game and his kicking made a big contribution to it. 

"He also added a layer of unpredictability to our attack in tough conditions and led the group really well. The feedback from [forwards coach] Colm Tucker and the guys that were bringing the water on was he was leading the group really well. We're delighted with him and it's an opportunity to Jack to follow up."

O'Connell has handed debuts to Shayne Bolton, Alex Kendellen and Hugh Gavin in a team showing six changes as Ireland prepare for their last game until they face the All Blacks in Chicago on 1 November.

Portugal are ranked 18th in the world, seven places below Georgia, but they scored three tries in a 64-21 loss to world champions South Africa last year and that has not escaped O'Connell's notice. 

"They take a lot of quick taps, a lot of quick lie-outs, they want to play quickly, they've very good backs, nippy backs," said O'Connell.

"I was on to [South Africa defence coach] Jerry Flannery there, they conceded three tries when they played against South Africa. 

"Their backs are quite a threat, so the ball will get more air from both sides. We want to play with the ball more than we did with Georgia, but we're happy enough not to play with it if it's conditions like last week."

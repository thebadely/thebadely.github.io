It's been everything to me - Vardy on Leicester tenure

Premier League champion, FA Cup winner, Leicester City legend - and now, very fleetingly, playing the role of referee.

When ref David Webb sank to the floor after being accidentally shoulder barged by Jordan Ayew in Leicester's 2-0 victory over Southampton at King Power Stadium, Jamie Vardy stepped in.

As Webb clutched his face on the ground, he took the opportunity to halt a Saints attack by blowing the stricken official's whistle.

"I saw Southampton breaking down the left and with the ref down I thought I'll blow his whistle to stop the game," Vardy said with a smile to BBC Match of the Day.

Although Webb was unable to continue - replaced by fourth official Sam Barrott - he was able to walk off the pitch unaided.

Vardy, 38, was clearly in high spirits, having scored Leicester's opener moments earlier with a crisp finish in the 17th minute.

That was his 199th goal for Leicester - the club he is leaving after 13 years when his contract expires in the summer.

The striker has three more games left this season to reach the 200-goal mark, make his 500th appearance for the club and cement his status as one of Leicester's greats.

"It's been everything," Vardy said when asked what Leicester meant to him.

"It's been mine and my family's life for 13 years. We've been taken in by the fans and the whole city, and it has meant every single thing to me personally.

"When it's been your life for that long and you see the camaraderie with the fans and my team-mates for the last 13 years, it's been unbelievable."

Not only did Vardy's finish take him closer to that 200-goal milestone, but it ended a nine-game club goalscoring drought at home.

"If there was one player to break this cycle, it had to be Jamie," Leicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy said.

"Goal number 199. Very important for him and the team to get us in front."

Ex-England international Vardy, who announced he would leave the club last week, said he "couldn't tell" what his future has in store.

"I am enjoying my football and I need a nice break to mentally, especially, and physically fully refresh and then we'll see where that goes," said Vardy, who has played 498 times for Leicester.

"There's still a few more games where hopefully there can be a few more numbers added."

It has been a disappointing final season for Vardy at Leicester, with just five wins in 35 games, while their relegation back to the Championship was confirmed on 20 April.

Leicester defender Conor Coady said the Foxes would make the remaining three games of the season all about Vardy, who he said was a "pleasure to call a team-mate".

"The next few games are about him, I'm not going to beat around the bush," Coady said. 

"He's Leicester's best ever player so we need to make sure the last couple of games are about him."

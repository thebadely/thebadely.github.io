Japan's Hideki Matsuyama beat Sweden's Alex Noren in a one-hole play-off to win his second Hero World Challenge title in Albany.

Matsuyama, 33, birdied the replayed 18th hole to take victory at the Tiger Woods-hosted event and claim the $1,000,000 (Â£750,000) prize pot.

Both players had finished with eight-under-par rounds of 64 to end tied on 22-under on Sunday.

The third round began with five players tied for the lead, but it was Austrian Josef Straka who led two-time defending champion Scottie Scheffler by one shot heading into the final round.

Straka carded 68 to finish one shot back in third position, while world number one Scheffler finished tied fourth with fellow American JJ Spaun at 20-under.

England's Justin Rose was sixth at 18-under after completing his best round of the week with 66.

Experts revealed that Armando Broja made his Premier League debut for Chelsea in 2020

Burnley are in advanced talks to sign Chelsea striker Armando Broja on a permanent deal.

A broad agreement has been reached between the clubs but the 23-year-old is yet to green light the move himself, with a five-year deal on the table.

Broja is keen on a move to Turf Moor but the move is not expected to go through until early next week.

Sources say the move could be worth up to Â£20m but the exact price has not been confirmed.

Broja joined the Chelsea academy in 2009 and signed his first professional deal with them in 2020.

He has made 38 appearances for the senior team, having had loan stints with Vitesse, Southampton, Fulham and Everton.

He scored his first goal for Chelsea in October 2022 but was subsequently ruled out of the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury in a friendly against Aston Villa a few months later.

Chelsea have been busy in the transfer market on the outgoing front this summer, moving several players as part of their squad reshaping. 

The Blues secured significant fees for key departures, which will help fund their ongoing rebuilding project.

Noni Madueke to Arsenal â Â£48.5m

Joao Felix to Al-Nassr â up to Â£43.7m

Djordje Petrovic to Bournemouth â Â£25m

Bashir Humphreys to Burnley â undisclosed

Kepa Arrizabalaga to Arsenal â Â£5m

Marcus Bettinelli to Manchester City â undisclosed

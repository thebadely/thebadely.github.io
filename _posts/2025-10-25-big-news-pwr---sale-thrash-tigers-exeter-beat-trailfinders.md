It has been recently reported that A victory over Exeter Chiefs last season was Sale's only win as they went on to finish last with four points

Sale Sharks, who managed just one win last season, enjoyed an excellent start to their Premiership Women's Rugby campaign as they cruised to a 46-17 triumph against Leicester Tigers.

Earlier on Saturday, a dominant first-half display helped Exeter Chiefs to a 24-12 victory at Trailfinders.

An expert performance before the break made the difference for Sale, too, as they entered half-time leading 34-5.

Amy Cokayne, Erica Jarrell, Holly Thorpe, Rhona Lloyd and Katie Childs scored first-half tries for the hosts, while they also benefited from a penalty try and Lizzie Duffy successfully converted once. 

Tess Feury went over for Leicester, but Sale soon replied as Amy Relf added another try in the 43rd minute, with Duffy converting, before Trudy Cowan made it 46-5 in the 60th minute.

In a lively end to the game, Fleury added another try, Leicester earned a penalty try and Childs was sent off for a second yellow card.

Exeter started brightly in their victory over Trailfinders, with Liv McGoverne opening the scoring after 13 minutes before Hope Rogers seized a loose ball and went over six minutes later, with McGoverne successfully converting.

In an excellent quick attacking move, Maisy Allen sent a pass to Gabriella Nigrelli out wide who delivered her side's third try, with McGoverne adding the extras to make it 19-0 at the break.

McGoverne was involved once again as her side made it 24-0 in the 49th minute, setting up England's Claudia Moloney-MacDonald out wide with a looping pass.

While Trailfinders looked like they were firmly out of contention, Kate Zackary gave the hosts hope when she spotted a gap and dived over in the 54th minute, with Meg Jones converting.

Their positive second-half display only brought five more points, though, as Georgia Ponsonby grounded in a crowded area out wide to reduce the deficit.

On Friday evening, the PWR season began as Harlequins beat Loughborough Lightning 52-48.

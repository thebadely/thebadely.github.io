France will face Ireland in the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals on Sunday, 14 Septhaving sealed the top spot in Pool D by hammering South Africa in Northampton.

The Springbok Women, who had already qualified for their first Women's World Cup quarter-final, face world champions New Zealand on Saturday in Exeter.

Les Bleues dominated the opening period and scored tries through full-back Emilie Boulard and centre Gabrielle Vernier.

But it was an upgraded red card for a head-on-head tackle by South Africa centre Chumisa Qawe that ultimately proved costly.

Forwards Charlotte Escudero and Agathe Gerin powered over to take advantage of the extra player, before the impressive Boulard grabbed her second.

In an attempt to salvage control, head coach Swys de Bruin emptied the forwards from his bench early in the second half - just as he did in his side's opening victory over Brazil.

It did not have the same impact and France wing Joanna Grisez scored twice, with Annaelle Deshaye and Alexandra Chambon also scoring.

Winning their group comes as no surprise for Les Bleues, who are peaking nicely as the tournament enters the knockout stages.

Based on form and seedings, a semi-final of England and France awaits. 

The Springbok Women, who finally got a try through energetic scrum-half Nadine Roos in the final play of the game, now face a mammoth task of defeating a Black Ferns side that put 40 points on Ireland.

It has been recently reported that Jersey's retail price index (RPI), which is a key measure of inflation on the island, increased by 2.8% last year - fuelled by increases in the prices of food, leisure, motoring and household services.

However, it is continuing to drop from a high of 12.7% in March 2023, according to government figures.

Statistics Jersey said among the increases, the cost of beef soared by 25.9%, coffee and cocoa went up 13.8% and butter increased by 12.2% last year.

Some shopping basket goods including bacon, cereals and processed fish became cheaper last year, according to the data.

Leisure services including entertainment costs, sports and leisure fees and off-island holidays made the largest contribution to the annual rate of inflation, said Statistics Jersey.

Fares and other travel costs went up 5.6% over the year and leisure services saw a 5.2% hike, the report said.

Motoring costs went up by 4.3%, while people saw a 3.3% increase in bills for household services.

The cost of household goods dropped in 2025, however, the figures show.

The overall RPI stayed the same between the quarter ending in September and the three months to December, at 2.8%.

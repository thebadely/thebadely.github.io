Experts revealed that David Hughes worked in the academies at Southampton and Cardiff City before joining Manchester United in 2022

David Hughes has left his role as Newport County manager after six months in charge.

He departs with the Exiles bottom of League Two, having won only three of their 16 fourth-tier matches this season.

Hughes confirmed his exit BBC Radio Wales before the club announced his departure, saying: "The reality would be it is going to be someone else's challenge moving forward.

"My time has come to an end. I understand why, we have not won enough games.

"I have spoken to the players and wished them all the best. Let's hope the next manager coming in can give them a bounce."

Newport later confirmed Hughes' departure, along with his assistant Wayne Hatswell "following a disappointing start to the season".

In their statement, Newport added: "We thank both Dave and Wayne for their hard work and commitment during their time at the club and wish them the very best for the future."

David Hughes: My time's come to an end

Welshman Hughes, 47, was appointed Newport boss in May, stepping down as a youth coach at Manchester United in order to take his first senior managerial role.

But he has endured a miserable spell at Rodney Parade, with Newport's inexperienced squad struggling to deliver results amid fan criticism of chairman Huw Jenkins' recruitment policy.

Newport had hoped for progress in 2025-26, having finished the last campaign in 22nd, with head coach Nelson Jardim leaving the club in April after just under a season in charge.

They began the new campaign with signs of promise, beating Barnet on penalties in the Carabao Cup and then taking four points from Hughes' first two league games.

However, they have lost their past seven home league matches and their 1-0 defeat at fellow strugglers Shrewsbury Town proved to be Hughes' final game in charge.

His exit leaves Newport looking for a fifth permanent boss since Mike Flynn departed in 2021.

10-man Everton stun Man Utd after Gueye sees red

Everton's Idrissa Gueye became just the third player to be sent off in the Premier League for an offence against his own team-mate - after he struck Michael Keane in the face during his side's 1-0 win at Manchester United.

The Senegal midfielder came to blows with Keane early in the game and received a straight red card for his action.

While there have only been two red cards of a similar nature in the Premier League, there have been plenty of occasions where team-mates have lost their cool with each other, but stayed on the pitch.

BBC Sport take a closer look at some of the more high-profile bust-ups between team-mates.

Man Utd 0-1 Everton: David Moyes post-match reaction

Gueye sent off for striking team-mate - but Moyes 'quite likes' it

Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar was furious with team-mate Steve McManaman after a poor clearance allowed Everton to score in a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in 1993.

McManaman argued back, angering Grobbelaar further and leading the keeper to grab his young team-mate and push him in the face. McManaman pushed back before retreating.

During a miserable Champions League campaign, Blackburn and England team-mates David Batty and Graeme le Saux lost it with each other after both went for the same loose ball on a freezing night at Spartak Moscow.

The incident came after only four minutes and left-back Le Saux broke his hand after punching the midfielder.

When team-mates fight - Dyer v Bowyer

In what was possibly the Premier League's most iconic case of warring team-mates, Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer traded blows in astonishing scenes - with opposition midfielder Gareth Barry stepping in to break them up.

With Newcastle already down to 10 men and trailing Aston Villa 3-0 at home, both players were sent off - with Dyer given a three-match ban and Bowyer suspended for seven games.

Emmanuel Adebayor and Nicklas Bendtner had a little quarrel during a derby

If losing the second leg of a League Cup semi-final to north London rivals Tottenham 5-1 was not bad enough, Arsenal forwards Nicklas Bendtner and Emmanuel Adebayor added an ugly row to the sorrow.

It left the Denmark international with a cut on the bridge of his nose and blood stains on his shirt.

This was the most recent Premier League red card for fighting a team-mate, until Idrissa Gueye

Stoke were leading 1-0 at West Ham when Andy Griffin slipped, allowing Carlton Cole to equalise for the Hammers.

That was the cue for pandemonium to break out as Potters forward Ricardo Fuller gave his captain an earful and slapped him in the face, which got him sent off.

Oh, and the hosts went on to score a late winner.

Aston Villa team-mates Anwar El Ghazi and Tyrone Mings' contretemps came in a goalless draw with West Ham.

Mings was unhappy at a lack of tracking back from the Dutch winger, who appeared to try and headbutt the centre-back before the pair resolved the situation at half-time.

With Tottenham leading 1-0 against Everton, then Spurs captain Hugo Lloris took exception to Son Heung-min failing to track back.

The Frenchman ran over and shoved Son in the back as the teams left the pitch at half-time, prompting a furious reaction that was forgotten after the break as they held on for a win.

Arsenal's Ben White and Oleksandr Zinchenko had to be separated following the hard-fought 2-1 victory over Nottingham Forest.

The heated confrontation between the defensive duo was sparked by the concession of a late goal and diffused by the Gunners' backroom staff.

Manager Mikel Arteta later praised both players for "demanding excellence".

Sheffield United team-mates Jack Robinson and Vinicius Souza escaped a VAR check

In February 2024, Sheffield United team-mates Jack Robinson and Vinicius Souza had to be separated as tempers flared during their 1-0 defeat at Wolves.

The bizarre spat between the Blades duo led to the video assistant referee checking for a possible red card, but no action was taken.

Manager Chris Wilder said his players did not "overstep the mark" and dismissed the incident as something that happens "at every club up and down the country, three or four times a year".

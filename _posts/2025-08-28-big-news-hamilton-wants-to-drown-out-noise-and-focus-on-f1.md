Let's dive into the details: Lewis Hamilton is yet to finish on the podium for Ferrari

Dutch Grand Prix

Venue: Zandvoort Dates: 29-31 August Race start: 14:00 BST on Sunday

Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app

Lewis Hamilton says he has got to try to âdrown out the noiseâ and focus on his love of Formula 1 after a difficult weekend in Hungary before the summer break. 

The 40-year-old said he was âjust uselessâ after he qualified in 12th place at the Hungaoring last time out, while his Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc took pole position. 

Hamilton finished the race where he started, failing to score points, but has returned after the shutdown with a positive outlook for the remaining 10 races of the season. 

"It's about calming some things down and getting back to... focusing on my job that I love,â said Hamilton on Thursday. 

The F1 season resumes this weekend with the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort, with Hamilton sixth in the driversâ championship. 

His comments following his qualifying struggles in Budapest made headlines, with Hamilton adding his lack of pace was "nothing to do with the car". He is down 12-5 in the qualifying head-to-head with Leclerc, in his first season with the Italian team. 

After spending time with friends and family - and dog Roscoe - during the break, Hamilton said of his "just useless" comments: âIt's obviously not truly how I feel.

"I've enjoyed being away and being able to unplug. Then just bring myself back to my core. That's how I've always been, with lots of meditation and finding gratitude in things every single day."

Hamiltonâs start to life at Ferrari has not hit the heights most were expecting. He won from pole position in the sprint event in China in March but since then it has been Monegasque Leclerc who has secured all of Ferrariâs five main podiums this year. 

"I still believe in the potential here and what we can achieve together, and I think everyone in the team does,â said Hamilton. 

âBut no one succeeds without going through those tough patches. So I do welcome it; looking forward to the sunnier days for sure."

As a seven-time world champion, and holder of multiple records in F1, Hamiltonâs credentials in the sport are there for all to see, including his fellow drivers.

âI think from the outside you never know for sure what is going on but Lewis doesn't need to prove anything,â said two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who was Hamiltonâs team-mate at McLaren for one season in 2007.  

"He's an incredible driver and he will figure out sooner or later to be at the top pace. He and Ferrari will be always a combo that you need to respect a lot."

Hamiltonâs former Mercedes team-mate George Russell echoed Alonsoâs words, saying that apart from McLaren duo Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, who are one and two in the title race, most drivers are looking forward to 2026, when the regulation changes usher in a new era. 

âI think, right now, with 14 races down, probably every driver bar two are looking forward to 2026 and for a fresh opportunity to fight for the championship," said Russell.

âFor someone like Lewis, that's what he lives for, not just getting in the points." 

Following the race in Zandvoort, Hamilton will be welcomed by the tifosi for the first time at Monza for next week's Italian Grand Prix.

Russo rescues point for Arsenal as Chelsea's unbeaten run continues

Despite the euphoria of watching Alessia Russo score an 87th-minute goal to grab a 1-1 draw with champions Chelsea, Arsenal manager Renee Slegers was clinical in her assessment of the controversial decisions that went against her side.

And she said video assistant referees (VAR) should be introduced in the Women's Super League to bring "justice".

Eight minutes into the second half, Stina Blackstenius thought she had cancelled out Alyssa Thompson's opening goal for Chelsea with a thunderous finish following a corner. 

But the Emirates Stadium was left in a state of confusion when play restarted with Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton taking a free-kick inside her box, rather than her team-mates taking the kick-off.

It transpired referee Melissa Burgin had ruled Blackstenius had handled the ball, though replays showed it had clearly struck her thigh.

The second "abysmal decision" - to quote former England international Izzy Christiansen on Sky Sports - came when Frida Maanum had scored what could have been a 90th-minute winner for Arsenal. 

That goal was ruled out for offside, with initial replays inconclusive.

Slegers was pragmatic about the "big" decisions.

"A lot of respect for referees because it's not easy," she said. "We're looking at video. If you ask me, we need justice and that's why I think VAR and technology can help.

"I don't want to elaborate too much but there's more and more at stake in the WSL. We have to have a look at how we grow the game in all aspects."

VAR has been utilised in the later stages of the Women's FA Cup and is also used in the Women's Champions League, but there are no plans yet to bring it into England's top flight.

While Slegers exuded calm, Christiansen adopted a more combative stance.

"Arsenal put themselves in a position in that second half that showed signs of a team that were so hungry to get back into the game," she said. "What they did was exceptional from start to finish in that second half.

"They scored two goals that have been disallowed. That game should have finished 3-1 to Arsenal.

"They were two absolutely abysmal decisions. I think it's cost them and they have been robbed. There's no other way to put it."

It was widely felt before this London derby that Arsenal needed to take all three points to keep alive their hopes of landing a first Women's Super League title since 2019.

And Christiansen believes the officials have had a "huge impact" on their title hopes.

"You look at the occasion here - the magnitude of it, the stadium, the crowd," she said. "Everything that Arsenal do so well, and the spotlight on the pitch. 

"The players delivered. The officials need to deliver as well, because these are two teams that are competing for titles."

Though Arsenal fans celebrated the draw, the fact is their team are five points adrift of a Chelsea side who have not been beaten in 33 WSL games.

The Gunners will, of course, continue to fight - but this was seen as the year they would push Chelsea all the way, and with December fast approaching they have a battle on their hands to even play in the Champions League next season.

Chelsea rode their luck to keep their unbeaten run intact, and equal the WSL record of 33 matches unbeaten.

Manager Sonia Bompastor said she understood Arsenal's frustration over the two disallowed goals.

"Having a draw is not a bad result," she said. "We want to win every game. 

"I understand this result is not the one we wanted to have, but we are early on in the season, and we are still in control and in a really good place."

Chelsea may have felt they should have been out of sight after dominating in the early stages, when they hit the post but failed to really make their dominance count. 

And after dropping points for the second time this season, they may not be sitting top of the WSL after the close of play on Sunday. 

Manchester City's resurgence under Andree Jeglertz means they can go a point in front of the defending champions with a win at Everton on Sunday.

Bompastor says she is "not worried" about Chelsea's league position.

"I think we are still early on in the season and I'm not worried about where we stand right now in the table," she said.

âWe always want to be the leaders and leading this league but the most important thing for us is to be leading the race at the end of the season. 

âI trust my squad - the quality I have in the squad to be able to do that. Not the result we wanted to have coming into the game today, but we are still in control and I am quite confident."

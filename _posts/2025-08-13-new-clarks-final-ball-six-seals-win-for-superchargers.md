Scorecard. Table

Graham Clark hit the final ball for six to snatch a dramatic three-wicket victory for Northern Superchargers against Southern Brave in The Hundred.

Needing five for victory or four for a tie, Durham batter Clark heaved England international Tymal Mills over the boundary at mid-wicket.

In a see-sawing finale, Superchargers needed only 11 from the last 10 with five wickets left before Jofra Archer struck twice and conceded only one run from his final five balls.

Clark swept the second ball of the last set from Mills for four to leave five to get from three but when Mills followed with two dot balls the hosts still appeared favourites. 

Mills opted for a slower ball again, however, and dropped to the ground when Clark clubbed it for six. 

Clark, in contrast, roared in delight and finished 38 not out from 24 balls, having left the previous delivery believing it to be a wide outside off stump. 

"That felt euphoric," he told Sky sports.

"I thought I messed it up when I left the ball before, but it's a good feeling to get over the line."

Superchargers clinch final-ball victory over Brave

This was the first time a match in the The Hundred men's or women's competitions was won by a six off from the final ball. Here's how the finale unfolded:

With Superchargers chasing 140, Clark came in at 75-4 when captain Harry Brook was caught off Mills for 24. Dan Lawrence then holed out for 10, while opener Zak Crawley was earlier caught for 29.

Brave bowler Chris Jordan limped off with an apparent groin injury, while having 15 of his balls still to bowl, leaving Brave short at the death.

New Zealand all-rounder Mitchell Santner capitalised by hitting Michael Bracewell's spin for a six and a four but then was caught at mid-on off Archer with eight balls to go. 

Archer followed with two dot balls to Tom Lawes - clocked at 92 and 90mph - before dismissing him caught and bowled, leaving Mills 10 to defend from the final five, before five were needed from three.

Mills went for a quicker ball next. which was missed by Clark and his fourth was a slower ball right onto the tramline outside off stump. Clark looked aggrieved a wide was not given. 

However, Clark was set for the slower ball again and, when Mills put it on a length, he heaved the ball over mid-wicket.

'Emotional' Buttler hits 57 off 34 balls

The Hundred men's competition, Cardiff

Welsh Fire 137-8 (100 balls): Currie 3-22, Tongue 3-25

Manchester Originals 112 (97 balls): Buttler 57 (34); Meredith 4-9

Welsh Fire won by 25 runs

Scorecard

Welsh Fire secured their first win of 2025 as they beat Manchester Originals by 25 runs, despite Jos Buttler's sublime 57 from 34 balls at Sophia Gardens. 

The game was in the balance, with Originals needing 35 from 20 balls in pursuit of 138 to win when the former England white-ball captain was dismissed by spinner Chris Green.

Buttler looked emotional and gestured to the sky with his bat when he reached his half-century from 28 balls, honouring his father, who died last week. 

Originals failed to recover from Buttler's departure as they slumped to 112 all out, a collapse of six wickets for nine runs at the death.

Australia seamer Riley Meredith started Fire's defence brilliantly with three early wickets, bowling with lively pace, as he finished with an incredible 4-9 and Green also impressed with 3-19.

England opener Phil Salt fell for three, with Green taking a fine catch on the boundary, Ben McKinney was beaten for pace and chipped to mid-off and Mark Chapman nicked to slip.  

Buttler was the only batter to find fluency on a tricky surface, clubbing two sixes and six fours, but only Lewis Gregory with 21 was able to offer him any substantial support.

Earlier, young England prospect Sonny Baker impressed again as he dismissed Jonny Bairstow for a three-ball duck in a fiery opening burst that left Fire playing catch-up.

Steve Smith made 26 before he was dismissed by England quick Josh Tongue, who has now bowled at the Australian four times across all formats and dismissed him on each occasion.

On a slow surface, the Originals bowlers chipped away with regular wickets as Fire failed to gather momentum. All-rounder Green threatened a powerful finish with two sixes in his 19 from nine balls, but he was caught on the boundary off Tongue with five balls left. 

Tongue bowled with decent pace to finish with 3-25, while Scott Currie closed out the innings effectively to take 3-21 and to become this year's leading wicket-taker, with eight scalps. 

The result sees Originals replace Fire at the bottom of the men's table, though Fire's women's side remain winless.

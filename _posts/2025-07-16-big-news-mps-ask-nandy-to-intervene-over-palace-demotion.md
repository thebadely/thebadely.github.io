It has been recently reported that Crystal Palace beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup last season

A group of Liberal Democrat MPs have asked the culture secretary Lisa Nandy to intervene over Uefa's "disgraceful" decision to demote Crystal Palace from the Europa League for breaching its multi-club ownership rules.

The seven politicians from London - including party leader Sir Ed Davey - wrote to express "deep concern" over what they called "a highly unusual and severe punishment on the club that raises serious questions about fairness and transparency in the governance of English football".

The Eagles, who qualified for the Europa League by winning the FA Cup - their first major trophy - in May, were demoted to the lower tier Conference League on Friday.

The rules of European football's governing body state that clubs owned, to a certain threshold of influence, by the same person or entity cannot compete in the same European competition.

American businessman John Textor owns a stake in Palace and is the majority owner of French club Lyon, who have also qualified for the Europa League.

Uefa's rules set a deadline of 1 March 2025 to show proof of multi-club ownership restructuring - a deadline which Palace missed.

In a letter seen by BBC Sport, the group of Lib Dems described the saga as "heart-breaking for fans".

"Other clubs seem to go through much more protracted disputes with less severe outcomes," they said.

"Many believe that this process has been opaque and disproportionately punitive [and] risks undermining not only the club's achievement but also public confidence in the fairness of football governance."

Nandy was urged to ensure "the decision-making process is reviewed for transparency and fairness" and that "the club is given a fair opportunity to appeal or respond to any allegations".

Nottingham Forest, who finished seventh in the Premier League last season, are set to replace Palace in the Europa League. 

On Tuesday, Palace supporters staged a protest against Uefa's decision with hundreds marching to Selhurst Park carrying banners and chanting against European football's governing body.

Meanwhile, Palace chairman Steve Parish has confirmed the club will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) over Uefa's decision.

"We are still fighting," Parish told the The Rest is Football, external podcast.

"There's an appeal process, so we go to Cas, and we're very hopeful. We think we've got great legal arguments.

"We don't think this is the right decision by any means. We know unequivocally that John didn't have decisive influence over the club.

"We know we proved that beyond all reasonable doubt because it's a fact."

Textor is currently in the process of selling his stake in Crystal Palace to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson.

Uefa has been approached for comment.

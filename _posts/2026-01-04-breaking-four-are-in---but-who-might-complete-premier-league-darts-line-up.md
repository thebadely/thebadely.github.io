Let's dive into the details: Should Gerwyn Price (left) and Nathan Aspinall (right) join Luke Littler and Gian van Veen (centre two) in the 2026 Premier League Darts line-up?

It is a lively debate every year: who should make the Premier League Darts line-up? 

This year is no different with some new names pushing their case and some well-known players perhaps not performing as well as they would hope. 

The eight-player line-up will be confirmed on Monday at 15:30 GMT.

Four players are guaranteed a place, but who could join them? 

BBC Sport looks at the contenders and then we want you to have your say at the bottom. 

The top four players in the world rankings are automatically guaranteed a place in the 16-week group stage. 

The other four are decided by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) with the Premier League an invitational event. 

PDC chief executive Matt Porter has previously said they consider "star quality" and people who can "perform on the big stage" so they can entice millions to watch on TV.

He said the PDC considers the past 12 months and if the players' game, temperament and brand is ready for the Premier League.

How do players get picked for Premier League Darts?

'I want to dominate' - Littler takes another step towards greatness

Luke Humphries won the Premier League for the first time in 2025

World number one and world champion Luke Littler will play in the event for the third year running. He won the title in 2024, before finishing as runner-up in 2025. He broke the record for the number of nightly wins in the league phase last year. 

Defending champion Luke Humphries is the next player guaranteed a spot, with the 30-year-old ranked second in the world. 

The Netherlands' Gian van Veen will feature in the tournament for the first time after his run to the final of the World Championships saw him climb to third in the rankings. The 23-year-old said he was "very excited" about the opportunity. 

He'll be joined by compatriot Michael van Gerwen. The seven-time Premier League winner has dropped to fourth in the rankings but that still earns an automatic slot.

Ranking: Fifth, Last Premier League: Semi-finals in 2023, Best Premier League finish: 2021 winner

The Welshman moved into the automatic qualification spots during the World Championships, but his quarter-final exit and Van Veen's run saw him drop back out.

The Ferret has had a good 2025, reaching the final of the Masters and last four of the UK Open, World Matchplay and World Grand Prix to show he is consistent on the big stage. 

He may feel he's overdue a return to the Premier League after winning the event in 2021 and following it up with two semi-final finishes. 

Speaking after his win in the fourth round of the Worlds, Clayton was asked about the Premier League and said: "I love it. It's the best tournament. It means everything to me."

Ranking: Seventh, Last Premier League: Eighth in 2025, Best Premier League finish: Eighth in 2025 and 2015

One of the most popular players on the circuit among the fans. 

The Bullet struggled in last year's Premier League after a nine-year hiatus, bar one challenger appearance. He finished bottom of the table and went pointless in the first eight weeks.

It was a mixed 2025 for Bunting, with his deepest runs in televised events seeing him reach the quarter-finals of the Masters and Matchplay.

A third-round exit at the World Championships meant he dropped out of the top four in the rankings and may mean he misses out. 

Gerwyn Price won three of the 16 nights in the 2025 group stage

Ranking: 12th, Last Premier League: Semi-finals in 2025, Best Premier League finish: 2023 runner-up

Would it be the Premier League without The Iceman?

A character on the stage and his Premier League record is strong in recent years. Yes, he was seventh in 2024, but he was in the semi-finals last year and was a beaten finalist in 2023. 

Although Littler has won their past eight meetings, Price won the six before that. Not many have that record against Littler and that has to come into the thinking, surely?

Hard to see how he doesn't get included despite a second-round exit at the Worlds. 

Ranking: 14th, Last Premier League: Semi-finals in 2025, Best Premier League finish: 2020 runner-up

Another fan favourite. Can we really have the Premier League without Mr Brightside being belted out every week?

The Asp has struggled with dartitis and confidence in the past 18 months but he reached his first Premier League finals night since 2021 last year and was pretty consistent. 

It has been an up and down year though, with quarter-finals in the Masters and UK Open mixed with first-round exits at the Matchplay and Grand Prix.

Touch and go perhaps, but the PDC know what they will be getting if he's included. 

Ranking: 13th, Last Premier League: Sixth in 2025, Best Premier League finish: Sixth in 2025

Hollywood's run to the World Championship semi-finals last year saw him return to the Premier League line-up.

It was a mixed campaign though. He made three finals - winning one - but he also lost his opening match in 10 of the 16 weeks. 

It has been a difficult year too. He made the quarter-finals of the Players Championships and round five of the UK Open, but failed to make it past the second round at the other televised events.

He was knocked out in the second round of the World Championship too and it feels unlikely he will be included. 

Rob Cross has failed to win a Premier League night in the past two years, reaching three finals

Ranking: 20th, Last Premier League: Seventh in 2025, Best Premier League finish: 2019 runner-up

The Voltage has finished sixth and seventh in the past two Premier Leagues, following two years out. 

Is that enough for him to remain? He didn't make the final once last season, losing seven times in the semi-finals. 

He reached round four of the Worlds over Christmas, but 2025 was not a good year. He made it to round six of the UK Open, but he was knocked out in round one of four other televised events. 

This may come down to whether the PDC want to stick with the tried and trusted or think 2026 is the year for a shake up. 

Ranking: Ninth, Last Premier League: N/A, Best Premier League finish: N/A

Do we fancy a debutant? 

The Northern Irishman is one of the biggest scorers on tour and has had a successful 2025 despite failing to land his first major title.

He's reached the last four of the UK Open and Matchplay and was a quarter-finalist at Grand Slam of Darts and Players Championship too.

Rocky exited the Worlds at the last 16, beaten by Justin Hood, and that may mean he hasn't quite pushed his case enough.

Again, it could come to down to whether the PDC want a refresh or not. 

Ranking: 10th, Last Premier League: N/A, Best Premier League finish: N/A

The Freeze is one of the most consistent players on tour, especially in 2025.

He reached the semi-finals of Masters, Grand Prix, European Championship and Grand Slam but that major title still eludes him.

A second-round exit at the Worlds in December may mean he has to wait again for a Premier League debut. 

Ranking: 11th, Last Premier League: Semi-finals in 2022, Best Premier League finish: 2009 winner

What about a returning name?

The Machine last played in the Premier League in 2022 - reaching the semi-finals - and has had a really consistent 2025. 

He made the final of the UK Open and Matchplay and was a quarter-finalist at the European Championship and Players Championship. 

A second-round exit at the Worlds isn't going to help his case though, and the mega prize money on offer there means he's slipped from seventh to 11th in the world rankings.

Gary Anderson finished eighth in his last two Premier League campaigns in 2021 and 2022

Ranking: Sixth, Last Premier League: Eighth in 2022, Best Premier League finish: 2011 and 2015 winner

The Flying Scotsman's run to the semi-finals of the World Championships has put his name on everyone's lips again.

The Premier League seems unlikely though. At 55, Anderson has made it pretty clear that he doesn't fancy the travelling involved, with 16 different cities and seven countries in 16 weeks, so any invitation is likely to be rejected. 

Kevin Painter, who played in the 2012 Premier League alongside Anderson, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I don't think he will [play in the Premier League]. That is for the lads in their 20s and 30s - it is tough doing it. 

"You can lose focus on other tournaments because you're just focused 100% on the Premier League. It drains you."

Ranking: Eighth, Last Premier League: N/A, Best Premier League finish: N/A

A run to the semi-finals of the World Championships has also put Heavy Metal's name on the radar as he climbs to a career-high eighth in the rankings. 

His scoring and finishing can be a match for anyone on its day, but Searle isn't sure whether "his face fits" in the Premier League. 

Regardless of that, his previous best run in 2025 was the fifth round of the UK Open.

It's unlikely he's done enough to earn a spot yet.

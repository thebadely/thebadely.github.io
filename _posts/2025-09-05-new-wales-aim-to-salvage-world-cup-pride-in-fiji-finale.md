Experts revealed that Nel Metcalfe and Nunia Daunimoala have been standout players for Wales and Fiji

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Wales v Fiji

Venue: Sandy Park, Exeter Date: Saturday, 6 September Kick-off: 14:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC One Wales, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport online and app, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and BBC Sounds

At a glance Wales v Fiji appears to be a meaningless dead rubber on a World Cup weekend packed with heavyweight clashes and knockout deciders.

But delve a little deeper and there are some tasty sub-plots in this first ever Test meeting between the two sides, and one that has attracted a sell-out Sandy Park crowd of 15,000.

For Wales, it is a final chance to prove their professional worth and silence some of the critics after heavy defeats by Scotland and Canada.

While Fiji, led by Wales' former head coach Ioan Cunningham, will no doubt fancy their chances against a side low on confidence and low on form.

While Cunningham said he bore no ill will towards Wales after his controversial departure last year, he would surely love to get one over on his former side.

It is a tough one to call. Fiji have only ever played 45 Tests, while Wales hooker Carys Phillips alone has played almost double that.

Wales edge it on paper but the question is which Wales will show up?

Wales head coach Sean Lynn has had a reshuffle once again, with co-captains Alex Callender and Kate Williams both returning to the side after picking up knocks in the opening round against Scotland.

Experienced hooker Carys Phillips has been trusted to steady Wales' malfunctioning lineout, replacing Molly Reardon who drops to the bench.

Great Britain sevens player Kayleigh Powell makes her first start of the tournament having made a notable impact off the bench against Canada. She is named at full-back, with Wales' standout player Nel Metcalfe switching to the wing in place of Jasmine Joyce-Butchers.

Georgia Evans moves to the second row to accommodate the returning Callender, with Abbie Fleming joining an experienced bench alongside the likes of Hannah Dallavalle and Gwenllian Pyrs.

Fiji head coach Ioan Cunningham has also made changes, some enforced through injury and suspension.

Vice-captain Bilita Tawake is unavailable after being handed a three match ban for a dangerous tackle against Scotland and is replaced at hooker by Keleni Marawa.

Karalaini Naisewa is also a new face in the front row, while Asinate Serevi, the daughter of Fijian rugby royalty Waisale Serevi, gets a start at lock.

Repeka Tove and Kolora Lomani come in on the wings after making an impact from the bench last weekend, while Alfreda Fisher once again leads the side.

"We want to make sure that we're finishing the tournament on a high," said Wales boss Lynn.

"It looks like both teams are going to throw the kitchen sink at each other. It's going to be a brilliant battle and I'm hoping we come out on top, but I've asked the girls to come off [the pitch] crawling.

"I thought they [Fiji] put in a really strong performance against Scotland.

"They're very exciting when they've got the ball in hand, and it's just making sure that when we've got the ball, we're looking after it, going through the phases and testing them in defence as well."

Wales co-captain Alex Callender said: "The tournament hasn't gone to plan, results haven't gone our way, but this is a game we want to win, showcase the team we are and how hard we've worked over the last couple of months.

"This weekend is about forwards working hard set-piece wise, and the backs gelling together and complimenting each other to get over the whitewash."

"We have been forced into some changes, but it's a strong team that we've put out, we're got some strong combinations together and we've rewarded some players that have trained really well," said Fiji head coach Cunningham.

"If we can get our foundations right and our fundamentals in the game it will give us a really good opportunity to challenge Wales.

"If we can shut down Lleucu's [George] time and space, then her kicking game will be put under pressure, but I'm sure they'll look at more of a territory and set piece game where we want the ball in hand a bit more.

Fiji lock Asinate Serevi said: "We're looking forward to playing Wales this weekend and we're reminding each other that we need to end on a high.

"We're excited to see the chemistry, it's definitely going to be a good game, we don't know how good a team is until we play them.

"We want to inspire the next generation of Fijiana players, and to make sure we're remembered for our fighting spirit."

BBC Radio Wales commentator Gareth Rhys Owen said: "How do you sell Saturday's game to the Welsh public? Well, there's the presence of their former coach, a Welshman leading their opponents and that's about it really. 

"Things could not have gone much worse for Sean Lynn's team in their opening two fixtures, and the reality is that this game has the potential to further the permanent state of depression for Welsh rugby. 

"Ioan Cunningham's Fiji showed enough promise and enterprise in their defeat to Scotland to suggest that they can test and strain a team that is low on confidence."

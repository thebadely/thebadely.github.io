According to new developments, Car manufacturer Nissan has unveiled details of its new Leaf electric vehicle, which is set to be built at its UK factory.

The third-generation model will be built at its Sunderland plant by its 6,000-strong team, the Japanese carmaker said.

The new Leaf will be able to travel up to 375 miles (604km) on a single charge and will be available for customers to order later this year, Nissan said.

It will be powered by batteries from AESC UK, Nissan's battery partner, which is based next to the Wearside factory.

The site already also builds the carmaker's Juke and Qashqai models.

Alan Johnson, senior vice president of manufacturing and supply chain management at Nissan Motor Manufacturing, said: "It's with immense pride that we unveil the third generation of our pioneering electric Leaf, 12 years after we brought EV and battery manufacturing to the UK.

"It's a testament to the skill of our world-class team that we can bring into mass production a vehicle with such advanced technology and aerodynamic design."

James Taylor, managing director of Nissan GB, said: "Leaf is a pioneering electric vehicle that has encouraged thousands to make the switch to electric motoring - and best of all, it's built here in Britain."

It is the first model to be launched under the company's blueprint for electric vehicle production, Nissan's EV36Zero project, which aims for sustainability.

Earlier this year, Â£1bn of investment was secured for a second AESC UK electric car battery plant.

According to new developments, A book of condolence is to be opened at a council's headquarters following the death of two firefighters and a man who were killed at an Oxfordshire business park.

Jennie Logan, 30, and Martyn Sadler, 38, died while tackling the fire at Bicester Motion on Thursday evening. David Chester, 57, a father of two who ran a business at the site and lived in Bicester, was also killed.

Many observed a two-minute silence in the town's Garth Park on Sunday and Bicester Town Council will open its book of condolence at Garth House from 09:00 BST on Monday.

Another two firefighters who suffered serious injuries remain in hospital, Thames Valley Police said.

Ms Logan and Mr Sadler were involved in Bicester Rugby Union Football Club's (BRUFC) women's team, Bicester Vixens.

"We are a tight knit club. We are a family and it's hit the club and the wider community very hard," BRUFC's chairman Paul Jaggers said.  

"Obviously losing two of your members in any situation is really tough and it's had a profound impact,"

Both firefighters worked for Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Mr Sadler was also part of the London Fire Brigade.

Mr Chester, who ran family business Chesters & Sons at Bicester Motion, joined the estate when it was bought 12 years ago and was described as "part of the fabric of our estate and a friend to us all".

Historic England, which had worked with Mr Chester, said he had been a "valued partner", who it was a "privilege" to work alongside.

Fire investigators and Thames Valley Police are working to establish the cause of the blaze in what the police said was a "complex investigation which may take some time".

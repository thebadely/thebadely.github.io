It has been recently reported that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): He kept a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he's really starting to command as a regular number one. He's starting to show that he commands the area in the right way. Obviously a penalty save always helps.

Michael Keane (Everton): The guy they tried to get rid of, they guy they wanted to replace, the guy they want to move on from, the guy who keeps telling them no. He keeps scoring, he keeps delivering. I think he's gotten really comfortable within his own skin as a human.

Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool): I thought this was a vintage Konate performance. Not only did he deliver physically, which we know he can do, but he was in a position to look after his team-mates. When Gabriel Martinelli tried to crudely push Conor Bradley off the pitch at the end, I'm glad Konate stuck up for his team. He got back physically, wasn't a liability and stood up strong. 

Max Alleyne (Manchester City): The young man played really, really well against a tough Brighton team. He never got caught wanting and had an opportunity to score. He conducted himself well, and I thought it was a glowing endorsement from Pep Guardiola to start him.

Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): The best player on the pitch. People will say: "Oh what about him and him?" But I don't care. If you play football and watch football, you know that Szoboszlai was everywhere. Did the dirty stuff, the horrible stuff, but was one of the best attacking options for Liverpool apart from Jeremie Frimpong. He dictated the play, it was a very good performance.

Joelinton (Newcastle): He's just a beast. The work that he has done, and the work Eddie Howe has done on him, is just frightening. He keeps popping up with important goals, but remember that they signed him as a striker. He's just turned into a beast of a midfielder who runs all over you.

Brenden Aaronson (Leeds): A couple of goals - though he was at fault for the handball, which was only down to him not being brave enough to take one in the face. Scored two and has won over the Leeds faithful. He's having a really good season and has borne the brunt of some unfair criticism from Leeds fans.

Ferdi Kadioglu (Brighton): He was a thorn in Nathan Ake's side all day. On another day, he'd be a bit lucky and score a goal or two, but he was excellent. Brighton weren't scared of Manchester City at all.

Harvey Barnes (Newcastle): Two goals, the second being the match-winner, which was absolute limbs and scenes. He's another player where you're like: "Go on, show us who you are." Unfortunately he always leaves you a little bit wanting. I'm always thinking there's more to come from him. That's not to take anything away from his goals.

Igor Thiago (Brentford): Sixteen goals this season. We spoke about him last week - he's flying. Scoring again, carrying Brentford. They've got a real chance as long as he stays fit and continues doing what he's doing.

Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United): He has had a torrid start to his Manchester United career. But he scored two goals at Burnley and you have to give it to him.

Keith Andrews (Brentford): It was a massive result for Brentford to beat Sunderland 3-0. At the start of the season, a lot of people were questioning whether Keith was the right man for the job and whether Brentford could stay in the league.

His inexperience, the squad getting depleted... now they find themselves on the path towards European places. It's frightening. Sunderland have been really good and I expected them to deal with the physicality of Brentford, but Brentford beat them up.

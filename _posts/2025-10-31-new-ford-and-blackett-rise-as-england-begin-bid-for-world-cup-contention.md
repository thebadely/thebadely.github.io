Let's dive into the details: Maro Itoje was named England captain at the start of this year

England are yet to establish themselves as genuine Rugby World Cup contenders for the 2027 tournament in Australia.

New talents have injected energy into Steve Borthwick's side, and wins over Ireland in 2024 and France this year have offered glimpses that England could challenge in two years' time.

But without a Six Nations title since 2020, or a notable win over one of the southern hemisphere's elite since 2022, they remain just outside rugby's top table - ranked fifth in the world rankings.

This autumn's fixtures against Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina present a chance to change that narrative.

Being on the fringe of the world's best is not a bad place to be two years out from the showpiece event, but the time to make a move is now.

"The ceiling for this team is right up at the sky," England captain Maro Itoje told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly. "When you represent England you want to win trophies - Six Nations and World Cups.

"That's definitely the ambition of this team. We have to work together, align and build the mentality.

"To reach those goals we have to win games like the one in front of us [against Australia]. That's why this weekend is extremely important."

Since this year's disappointing opening Six Nations defeat by Ireland, England have put together a seven-match winning streak.

An impressive series victory in Argentina, while their British and Irish Lions were away in Australia, showcased some of their best rugby under Borthwick.

Late-game lapses cost England last autumn, when both the Wallabies - now a far stronger outfit - and the All Blacks snatched wins in the closing stages.

Borthwick has responded by naming six Lions - including Ellis Genge and Tom Curry - on the bench for the game with Australia, hoping to maintain intensity deep into the match.

Things are moving in the right direction: depth is building, performances are improving - but to truly believe, England must now start beating the best on a consistent basis.

"It is about how hard we are willing to work in order to solve problems when the game gets a bit sticky," added Itoje.

"When faced with adversity, it is about how we react and support each other.

"They are important characteristics and attributes to be a dominant team."

Fin and Marcus Smith both toured with the Lions, but Borthwick has rewarded George Ford's "excellent" summer performances by sticking with the Sale Sharks fly-half.

With 102 international caps, Ford's leadership and high standards in training were key factors behind his selection, with Itoje noticing a change on his return to camp after Lions duty.

"I didn't train in the first mini-camp," Itoje said. "I was watching training and was taken aback by the increase in intensity.

"The height and speed of training made me think, this is pretty full-on. It's exciting to be part of the team and see what we can do at the weekend."

Former Bath coach Lee Blackett has become England's full-time attack coach after helping the team achieve three wins from three in the summer.

His expansive style - which helped Bath lift the Premiership title last season - has been quickly adopted, with Ford instrumental in implementing his ideas.

Saturday's back three of Tom Roebuck, Freddie Steward and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso also featured on the summer tour and are well-versed in Blackett's approach.

This weekend there will be significant interest in how starting Lions wing Tommy Freeman fits into the mix at centre.

The fly-half debate will remain a live one over the next two years given the quality of all three contenders, but if 32-year-old Ford maintains his form it will be difficult for Borthwick to look elsewhere.

Australia's revival under Joe Schmidt sparked into life last autumn when Max Jorgensen's late try snatched victory over England.

A 2-1 Lions series defeat in the summer left them with plenty of 'what ifs', with Schmidt's side entering the opening Test undercooked after just one warm-up match against Fiji.

Will Skelton's limited fitness played a big factor in the series and the imposing La Rochelle lock will miss Saturday's game because it falls outside the international window for the release of overseas players.

Schmidt, who will hand over the head coach role to Les Kiss next year, is also unable to pick experienced fly-half James O'Connor, now with Leicester Tigers, and Exeter Chiefs duo Len Ikitau and Tom Hooper.

He can still call on two genuine game-changers in outside centre Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii and flanker Rob Valetini - though the timing of the Test may still favour England, who have been able to pick from a full-strength squad.

Added spice has been added by Borthwick reportedly accusing Australia of 'illegal' breakdown tactics,, external highlighting more than 40 side-entry offences that promote player-safety concerns - but something visiting captain Harry Wilson rejected.

The Wallabies, who beat South Africa and Argentina in the recent Rugby Championship, sit two places below Borthwick's side in the world rankings.

A win on Saturday would not suddenly make England World Cup contenders, but another composed, clinical performance would underline their steady upward trajectory towards that ultimate goal.

A home defeat, however, would suggest they remain part of the chasing pack behind the world's elite - even if their opponents are arguably more up to speed, having played Tests in September and October. 

"The true pinnacle of rugby is lifting that Webb Ellis Trophy - without a shadow of a doubt, that would be a dream," said Itoje.

"It's something I want to be part of, and I believe this team is capable of it."

If England want the rest of the rugby world to take notice, victory on Saturday is essential.

According to new developments, Beau Greaves is top of the PDC women's series rankings

Beau Greaves emerged victorious from a 6-5 thriller against Luke Littler as she became the first woman to reach the final of the World Youth Championship.

Littler came into the tournament in Wigan on the back of his 6-1 demolition of world number one Luke Humphries in the World Grand Prix final on Sunday.

The 18-year-old had breezed through his three matches in the round-robin phase of the event, with wins over Dutchman Jeffrey Keen, Iceland's Alexander Thorvaldsson and Belgium's Matthias Moors.

However, the world champion nearly exited the tournament at the hands of fellow Englishman Charlie Manby in the last 16.

Littler was on the brink of defeat at 5-3 down to the 20-year-old, before fighting back to clinch a gritty victory.

Warrington teenager Littler found himself 2-1 down in the semi-final against Greaves and responded by winning three consecutive legs to seize the upper hand.

But three-time WDF women's world champion Greaves - who is set to accept a PDC Tour card for 2026-27 - rallied to level the match at 4-4 and 5-5.

Greaves then blew Littler away in the decider as she threw an 11-dart leg - the 21-year-old from Doncaster sealing victory with a checkout of 84.

She will meet defending champion Gian van Veen in next month's final after the Dutchman, 23, clinched a 6-4 win over Sebastian Bialecki of Poland in the other semi-final.

The World Youth Championship final will be played on 23 November in Minehead, before the Players Championship final on the same day.

Littler, who averaged 107.4 to Greaves' 105, posted on Instagram after his defeat: "Fair play to Beau. All the best in Minehead. Some talent."

Players aged between 16 and 24 are eligible to compete in the World Youth Championship.

Littler won the youth title in 2023 aged 16, a few weeks before he burst into the spotlight by finishing runner-up at the 2024 World Championship.

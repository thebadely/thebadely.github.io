According to new developments, Cristian Romero has made 126 appearances for Tottenham since joining in 2021

Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero has signed a new four-year contract to commit his future to the club.

The 27-year-old Argentina centre-back joined Spurs from Atalanta in August 2021, initially on loan before the move was made permanent the following summer.

He has made 126 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals, and captained the side in the Europa League final as Tottenham beat Manchester United to end their 17-year wait for a trophy.

After being heavily linked with a move to Atletico Madrid over the summer, Romero was named club captain by new head coach Thomas Frank and the deal ensures he will remain under contract in north London until 2029.

Romero said he was "very happy" at Spurs and after helping them win the Europa League in the previous campaign has predicted a "special season" ahead for the club.

"We want to win. Maybe why not win again this season? Another trophy with the club is important for everyone," Romero explained.

"For me this club is the best in the world. The last two weeks, first [being appointed] captain and now signing the contract with the club - for me it's a fantastic decision."

Frank said last week that Romero was a player who commands "big respect" from his team-mates and "sets the standards" on and off the pitch.

"What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his leadership qualities," said the Spurs boss.

"The staff have said to me they've never seen him train that well. He's in a very good place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team."

The former Belgrano defender, who had two years left on his previous deal, follows right-back Djed Spence in signing a new long-term contract.

Spence, 25, arrived from Middlesbrough in 2022 but endured a difficult start to his Spurs career and had loan spells at Rennes, Leeds and Genoa.

Last season he emerged as an important player for former boss Ange Postecoglou and has made 42 appearances, scoring twice.

Spence's existing deal had been set to expire in 2028.

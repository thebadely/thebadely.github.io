It has been recently reported that Virgin Trains has moved closer to being able to run rail services through the Channel Tunnel after the regulator approved its application to share a depot with Eurostar.

The decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) means Eurostar's monopoly on passenger services is set to be broken for the first time since the tunnel opened in 1994.

Temple Mills railway storehouse in east London is the only depot in the UK able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe and which is already linked to the cross-Channel line.

Virgin aims to start running services from 2030. Eurostar said it was reviewing the decision and "considering our next steps to ensure we can continue to grow".

"Our priority is to deliver for passengers the benefits of the investments in a new fleet, jobs, and depot facilities that we recently announced," a Eurostar spokesperson said.

Previously, the ORR had said the Temple Mills depot had enough space to either house an expanded Eurostar fleet or accommodate a rival company's trains – but not both.

The regulator said a number of steps needed to be taken before new international services could run. Virgin needs to enter into a commercial agreement with Eurostar, will have to secure finance, access to track and stations, and have to get safety approvals from UK and EU authorities.

But the ORR said its decision unlocked plans for around £700m of investment and could create 400 new jobs, describing it as "a win for passengers, customer choice, and economic growth".

Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, said: "The ORR's decision is the right one for consumers – it's time to end this 30-year monopoly and bring some Virgin magic to the cross-Channel route."

Rail Minister Lord Hendy said he was "incredibly pleased" with the ORR's decision and called it a "significant step forward".

"Allowing Virgin Trains to share this vital facility will give passengers greater choice, better value and improve connectivity for millions, as well as drive innovation, lower fares and promote greener connections with Europe," he said.

Martin Jones, deputy director of Access and International at the ORR, said: "While there is still some way to go before the first new services can run, we stand ready to work with Virgin Trains as their plans develop."

Several firms had wanted to start operating services between London and mainland Europe, including Spanish start-up Evolyn, Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.

The ORR only approved Virgin's application on Thursday and rejected applications from Evolyn, Gemini and Trenitalia.

Virgin said it planned to launch rail services from London St Pancras to Europe from 2030.

This will include services to Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels-Midi and Amsterdam Centraal, with future plans to expand further across France, and into Germany and Switzerland.

The plans would mean Virgin Trains returning to the rails for the first time since 2019, when the company lost its contract to Avanti West Coast.

Virgin Trains had operated a service running from London Euston via Birmingham and Manchester to Scotland for 22 years before it was disqualified from bidding for the franchise.

Let's dive into the details: Monday night marked one of the world's biggest nights of fashion, as stars served up their most iconic looks for the annual Met Gala in New York City.

The theme for this year's event was "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear.

It was inspired by a newly unveiled exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute featuring the "black dandy", which Vogue says "examines the importance of clothing and style to the formation of black identities in the Atlantic diaspora".

Met Gala 2025: Live coverage

A-list celebrities including Zendaya, Demi Moore and Diana Ross brought their own interpretation to the theme, stunning in tailored suits and dramatic gowns. 

Here is a look at some of the highlights:

Zendaya, known for her dazzling red carpet style, opted for a wide-brimmed hat and tailored Louis Vuitton cream suit at this year's Met Gala.

But there was one slight pop of colour: her manicured red nails.

Kim Kardashian wore an all-black ensemble by LA-based brand Chrome Hearts - a fitted leather top and skirt that she offset with diamond necklaces and two strings of pearls.

She is, of course, no stranger to the Met Gala - having made headlines with a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 2022, and a wet-look Thierry Mugler dress in 2019.

Demi Moore gave us another round of method dressing. 

Her press tour for The Substance recalled the body horror themes of the movie, while her awards campaign for the role of Elisabeth Sparkle saw her dressing for the  glam statuettes.

Moore understood the assignment for the Met Gala, coming as a literal men's tie in a sculptural black and white striped sequin gown from Thom Browne.

Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny wore a brown Prada suit, which he said he worked on with the Italian fashion house for a few months before the event.

He also stayed on theme by accessorising with embellished gloves, a brooch and a hat that paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage. 

"We did something special," he said of his look. "I feel good, and I hope people think I'm looking good."

Rihanna, typically one of the most stylish attendees at the Gala, returned to the Met steps this year in Marc Jacobs, debuting her pregnancy with co-chair of the evening A$AP Rocky.

Legendary singer Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble, complete with feathers and a long train that required at least two assistants. 

On the carpet, Ross said her son persuaded her to attend this year's event. The last time she attended the Met Gala is 2003.

She added she had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on her dress train.

Black British designer Grace Wales Bonner dressed British Formula One star Sir Lewis Hamilton for the night. Sir Lewis was a co-chair of this year's event.

The pair have worked together in the past with Wales Bonner dressing Hamilton for the 2023 British Fashion Awards.

Actress Sydney Sweeney wore a custom Miu Miu gown - her third time wearing the designer at the Met Gala. This time, her dress was complete with beaded fringe shoulders and gold hardware detailing on the neck.

Speaking about her look, Sweeney said it paid homage to actress and painter Kim Novak. Sweeney is set to portray Novak in the upcoming film Scandalous.

Irish actor Barry Keoghan wore a custom-made Valentino fit, with florals embroidered on the cuffs and a silk red scarf wrapped around the waist.

New Zealand singer Lorde made a rare appearance at the Met Gala this year (she has not attended since 2021).

She wore a metallic silver floor-length skirt set, and a matching bandeau and blazer designed by Thom Browne. 

Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Simone Biles brought a pop of colour to the Met Gala carpet with a striking blue minidress that featured a collared neckline, a long train and jewelled appliques. 

The dress was designed by Harbison Studio.

Singer Coco Jones opted for a look designed by Indian brand Manish Malhotra.

She wore a tailored cream and white look that featured ornate embroidery and a dramatic long-sleeve coat. Jones also wore a large statement necklace and Jimmy Choo heels.

Actor and playwright Colman Domingo could have inspired this year's Met Gala theme, as he's been carrying the baton for well-dressed men on the red carpet for several years now. 

He donned a royal blue Valentino cloak that paid homage to Andre Leon Talley, former editor-at-large on Vogue whom Anna Wintour called "a dandy among dandies."

The cape later was removed to reveal a second look underneath: a tailored, patterned suit complete with a big fabric, polka-dotted flower brooch. 

Actress and singer Teyana Taylor, who hosted Vogue's live stream of the red carpet, arrived in custom Marc Jacobs on the arm of costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Ms Carter has worked with filmmaker Spike Lee and on the Black Panther movie franchise to create some modern pop cultural cues for the black dandy. 

Taylor wore a burgundy cape embroidered with "Harlem Rose," a nod to her 2018 song A Rose in Harlem.

Social media influencer Emma Chamberlain looked sharp and on theme with a backless tailored suit dress designed by French fashion house Courrèges.

She accessorised the look with a spiky beach blonde pixie cut and stylish eyeglasses.

Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, known for her on-theme style, wore a Givenchy ensemble featuring a bedazzled bodice and an extra-long black train with matching leather boots and nails. 

Sabrina Carpenter wore a burgundy Louis Vuitton bodysuit that featured all the tailoring of a regular suit. 

The singer said she worked with recording artist Pharrell Williams - also the men's creative director of Louis Vuitton - on the bottomless look. 

"You're quite short, so no pants for you," Carpenter recalled Williams telling her. 

Recording artist Doja Cat wore a custom Marc Jacobs look that featured giant shoulder pads and a leopard-print bustier panel. 

"I just wanted to feel like a little gangsta," she said. 

"I feel like he brought that with the strong shape of the shoulders, and all of the exaggerated shapes," Doja Cat said of Jacobs.

Actress Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the few people who wore pink at this year's Met Gala.

She donned a custom Marc Jacobs suit that was complete with a giant, hot pink bow at the back, a matching top hat and some unique bling. 

In one of the more memorable looks of the evening, Andre 3000 showed up to the Met Gala carpet with a black and white piano strapped to his back and a trash bag as a purse.

The stylish OutKast rapper designed the look himself in collaboration with Burberry. 

Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o wore a stunning powder blue Chanel suit, with a matching hat and transparent cape.

She accessorised the look with bedazzled, black rhinestone eyebrows.

Rapper Cardi B debuted a new hairstyle (and eye colour) in a green Burberry pantsuit, complete with matching nails and eye shadow.

Doechii took brand representation to new levels, stamping the famous Louis Vuitton logo on her face to go along with the motif of her suit.

The American rapper is often seen wearing looks from the French fashion house. 

This outfit combined the designer's two famous patterns - the LV monogram pattern on the waistcoat and jacket, as well as the damier checkerboard on the shorts.

When asked about her outfit on the carpet, Janelle Monáe responded simply - "free" - followed by an expletive.

"And when I'm in my suit, that is exactly how I feel," she said.

She wore a Thom Brown suit, with whom she's attended the Met Gala as a guest for the last several years. The look is styled by the Academy Award-winning costume designer for Wicked, Paul Tazewell.

Pop legend Madonna accessorised her cream-colored tuxedo with a cigar, creating an interplay between soft feminine materials and a distinct masculine energy. 

It's a dynamic that the superstar has played with throughout her career.

It has been recently reported that Mitchell Mann had not got past the first round of the British Open before

A flat tyre meant Mitchell Mann was docked a frame after starting his British Open match against Gao Yang late - but he rallied to win 4-3.

The 33-year-old had to abandon his car and started 10 minutes late and already 1-0 down before fighting his way into the third round.

"I was on the hard shoulder and had no spare tyre, I was completely stranded," said the world number 91.

"Luckily my friends answered my call and they came to pick me up. One of them drove me to Cheltenham and the other waited with my car for the RAC.

"I should have driven down last night, it's a lesson learned. I have no idea where my car is now!"

Mark Allen is through to the third round with a 4-1 win against Hungary's Bulcsu Revesz.

The Antrim man made it two wins in as many days, following his victory over Jiang Jun on Tuesday.

Allen made an excellent start by banking the opening two frames, including a break of 60 in the second.

Revesz, who shocked Ali Carter in the same tournament last year, recovered well in the third to pull a frame back.

However, the English Open winner hit back in the fourth and sealed his passage into the third round with a 69 break in the fifth.

He will now face Wales' Mark Williams on Thursday, while fellow Antrim man Robbie McGuigan faces Ben Mertens in his third-round match following the Belgian's 4-0 win against England's Reanne Evans.

John Higgins defeated current world champion Zhao Xingtong 4-2 to advance.

Judd Trump beat Leone Crowley 4-1, Shaun Murphy beat Scott Donaldson 4-1 and defending champion Mark Selby hit a 115 break in a 4-3 win over Liu Hongyu.

Experts revealed that When Clare Jones put up a Facebook post asking for extra Christmas cards to make her last Christmas "super special", she never expected thousands of responses.

The mum-of-three was diagnosed with bowel cancer in May 2022 but was recently told her chemotherapy was no longer responding and she has about 10 months to live.

"I'm a simple person who likes simple things," Clare said in her post, adding: "I love Christmas cards. I would love to have lots of cards this year."

"So I'm asking you kindly, when you are doing your cards could you pop an extra one in the post for me?"

What Clare, 47, hoped would be an extra 10 to 15 Christmas cards from friends has been shared by more than 10,000 people, with hundreds flocking to the comments from across the world with well wishes.

Clare said she has been "overwhelmed" with love and has so far received thousands of Christmas cards, as well as flowers, chocolates, personalised gifts, theatre tickets and even caravan holidays.

"Someone even offered me a night with them," Clare laughed.

"I said 'that's very kind of you but no thank you'."

Clare, from Pontarddulais, Swansea, said the reaction had been "amazing" and she had been thinking about putting a post up for a while but worried it would be seen as "cheeky".

She made the online request as she always felt Christmas was special and she had "always made a fuss".

After an operation to remove an 18 inch tumour in 2022, one year later Clare was told the bowel cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs, and had developed to stage four.

She has been on chemotherapy ever since but said she was informed in November that her chemotherapy to help shrink the cancer was no longer responding and 10 months was the average prognosis for someone in her position.

"But am I average? I've never been average," Clare laughed.

While realistic about her diagnosis, Clare remains hopeful for a "Christmas miracle". 

Sitting in her kitchen surrounded by flowers and hand-written Christmas wishes, Clare said she and her family have both laughed and cried at the messages left in some of the cards. 

"A simple card with a simple message has really made our Christmas, all of us," she said. 

From poems and letters to children's handmade cards, Clare says the messages of shared experiences and positivity have touched them all.

"There has just been so much to read," said Clare, adding: "The love has been amazing... genuine love."

America, Greece, Holland, Spain, Germany, France and New Zealand are just some of the countries which Clare has received cards from.

She described the last few months as extremely difficult as she had to tell her three children Summer, 16, Sami, 22, and Finley, 20, that this Christmas could well be her last. 

"How do you tell them that? My daughter doesn't believe it."

All three live at home with Clare, who has raised them independently for the past 10 years, and one of Clare's greatest worries is leaving them behind. 

"Who have they got? I try and think positively, but this is real.

"I remember when my children were leaving primary school, I would think its their last concert at primary school... you go through the stages of last last.

"But when you're talking about yourself, it's the last time you're ever going to see Christmas, you know, Halloween is gone and you didn't realise that was your last Halloween, last Christmas, last birthday. 

"Your mind runs away with you then when you're told ten months." 

After posting on Facebook, Clare said she received three cards just a few hours later from people in the area she had never met before: "It's been crazy, how nice people can be."

Clare said she loves getting cards and likes to keep hold of them but "doesn't receive many Christmas cards anymore".

Whereas older generations would send cards, people now tended to send messages,  she said, "which is great but it's not quite the same".

With deliveries from the postman now a daily occurrence, Clare has spared a thought for her postman, but said he has been wonderful and so patient. 

And despite the hundreds of cards passing through her letterbox everyday, Clare plans to thank each person individually.

"I want to respond to everybody, everyone has been so kind," she said. 

Clare is collecting all of the stamps to be sent to a bone cancer charity, as they sell the stamps on and put the proceeds back into their charity work. 

Clare said she was kicking herself for not seeing a doctor sooner as she had symptoms for a long time but "put it down to having a dodgy belly".

She added: "I don't feel ill, I feel OK. But I'm not going to feel this way for much longer.

"I have many people around me who care for me. If love could cure cancer, I would be cured."

Clare has several trips planned with her family over Christmas, including a caravan holiday and a day out at the theatre, at the time of year she has always loved.

"I didn't want to dampen Christmas with it being my last one, spending that Christmas being upset, but it's hard not to. 

"As much as I love Christmas and we're going to have a great Christmas... it's still going to be in the back of my head and in my families head that its the last Christmas we're having.

"I want to spend what time I've got left with family."

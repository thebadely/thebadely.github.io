Experts revealed that Luke Littler, Luke Humphries, Virginia Wade and David Beckham all feature in the King's Birthday Honours List

Darts players Luke Littler and Luke Humphries have become MBEs in the King's Birthday Honours, while Virginia Wade is made a CBE and knighthoods are confirmed for David Beckham and Billy Boston.

The awards for teenage world champion Littler and world number one Humphries are further evidence of darts' booming popularity.

Former tennis player Wade, meanwhile, is the only British woman to have won titles at all four majors. She is honoured for her services to the sport and charity.

News of former England football captain Beckham becoming a 'Sir' emerged last week, while rugby league legend Boston was knighted on Monday.

Motorcyclist Michael Dunlop - the winner of a record 33 Isle of Man TT races, will become an MBE. The Northern Irish rider has carried on racing after the death of his father, brother and uncle in road accidents. 

Aston Villa striker Rachel Daly - capped 84 times by England - is another to become an MBE, along with golfer Trish Johnson, BBC gymnastics commentator Christine Still, Bury FC chair Marcel de Matas and former Great Britain basketball player Julius Joseph.

Boxer Natasha Jonas, former Great Britain ice hockey captain Saffron Lane and wheelchair tennis player Andy Lapthorne are also honoured along with former England cricketers Steven Davies, external and David 'Syd' Lawrence.

Deta Hedman - the winner of more than 200 titles and the first black woman to play in the PDC World Darts Championship - is made an OBE, as is former England cricketer Devon Malcolm.

Retired Paralympic swimming champion and volleyball player Monica Vaughan and two-time Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee are also appointed OBEs.

So too is Oldham Athletic owner Frank Rothwell, for charitable services to dementia research.

Littler and Humphries are honoured in the week they compete together for England at the World Cup of Darts in Germany.

"This is an amazing and unexpected honour but one which I am very grateful for," said Littler.

"To receive a recognition like this is something I had never thought would be possible, and it is a proud moment.

"It's unbelievable what I've done for my sport; I'm happy, my family is happy and I can't wait to receive it."

In January, Littler - aged 17 - became the youngest world darts champion in history, beating three-time winner Michael van Gerwen 7-3 in the PDC final.

The teenager was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in December and was also runner-up for the main award.

He is not the youngest sporting figure to feature on the honours list, however - Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds was made an MBE aged 14 in 2009.

Littler's rise, which has also brought Grand Slam of Darts, World Series and UK Open titles, has helped fuel a boom for darts, with record crowds, prize money and numbers of young people taking up the game.

Humphries, 30, the reigning World Matchplay, Premier League, Players Championship Finals and World Masters champion, said he "couldnt believe it" when notified of his award.

"Everyone's talking about darts now, and I think that we're two of the pioneering parts of that," he added.

"We've changed the face of darts over the last couple of years. It's starting to become a younger man's game. It's nice to be at the forefront of that."

His most recent big victory came in the Premier League last month, when he defeated 2024 champion Littler in the final.

The pair join fellow darts players Keith Deller, Trina Gulliver, Fallon Sherrock, John Lowe and the late Eric Bristow as MBEs.

Wade, now 79, remains the last British woman to secure the singles crown at SW19.

She won three Grand Slam singles titles in all, having also triumphed at the US Open and Australian Open. Wade also secured women's doubles titles in New York and Melbourne, along with the French Open.

She went on to become a successful commentator and pundit, and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1989.

This is the third time she has been included in a Birthday Honours list, having made the Queen's in both 1973 (MBE) and 1986 (OBE).

Beckham, 50, was appointed an OBE in 2003 and receives further recognition for both his football career and charity work.

He played 115 times for his country as well as for Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, Paris St-Germain and AC Milan, retiring in 2013.

"Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour," said Beckham.

"It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family."

Beckham was reportedly first nominated for a knighthood in 2011.

In 2017 several British newspapers printed details of leaked emails in which Beckham allegedly criticised the honours system and the honours committee.

A spokesperson for Beckham said at the time the emails were "hacked", "doctored" and "private".

Beckham played a key role in helping London secure the 2012 Olympics, and has been an ambassador for children's charity Unicef since 2005.

He also became an ambassador for The King's Foundation in 2024 - supporting King Charles' education programme and efforts to ensure young people have a greater understanding of nature.

"I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation," Beckham added.

"I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment."

Boston received his honour from King Charles at Buckingham Palace, making him the sport's first knight in its 130-year history.

The 90-year-old was awarded his knighthood early - before the birthday honours list was officially announced - because of concerns over his health.

Cardiff-born, he was one of the greatest stars of rugby league and a trailblazer for black sports stars when he played for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s.

Boston, who has been living with dementia, was accompanied at the Palace by his family and representatives of his former club.

Sir Billy Boston won three Challenge Cups and scored 24 tries in 31 appearances for Great Britain

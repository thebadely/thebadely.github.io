Rogers nets twice as Villa come from behind to beat Leeds

"We are not collecting the most talented players. We are trying to build a team. Teams win trophies, no-one else."

Thomas Tuchel may not have mentioned Morgan Rogers by name after England's win against Wales in October, but it was clear the Three Lions boss was referring to the Aston Villa midfielder when stressing he would not pick players on reputation alone. 

Despite an abundance of top-class competition, the 23-year-old has started four of England's past five matches.

And with two goals in Villa's win at Leeds on Sunday, Rogers delivered another reminder of why he is ahead of the likes of Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer for the Three Lions. 

But will the England number 10 position still be Rogers' come next summer's World Cup? 

Rogers, like Villa, made a slow start to this Premier League campaign.

The midfielder had only scored once in 11 matches before his double at Elland Road.

But his form has improved dramatically in recent weeks - and has coincided with an uplift in Villa's results.

Unai Emery's side have won six of their past seven league matches, with Rogers now having three goals and two assists in that spell. 

"He was performing fantastic, even when he wasn't scoring," Emery told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It has always been his task to focus on the gameplan we have. Always he's playing well. Today it's better to be scoring goals but to me he's always the same. His season has been fantastic. 

"He is getting progressively better like the team. And today, scoring goals, he was brilliant."

Of course, there is more to football than just goals or assists, and Rogers offers plenty without those goal contributions.

Emery has also been working hard with Rogers to improve the midfielder's movement.

"The manager's always banging on at me to get into the box," said Rogers.

"That's where the goals are scored. Sometimes I'm hesitant to go in. I went in and just kind of reacted to the ball [for his first goal].

"I'm lucky I could get a toe on it. I was really happy with that one."

Based on the numbers alone, Rogers more than holds his own against Foden, Bellingham and Palmer - his main competitors for the England attacking midfield role.

The Villa playmaker is tied with Foden on 17 goals since the start of last season, one fewer than the 18 Bellingham has managed for Real Madrid. 

Rogers has more assists (16), more dribbles (127) and more touches in the opponents' box (307) than the rest. 

Ominously for his competition, Rogers added another string to his bow on Sunday by netting his first free-kick for Villa.

The midfielder strolled up to the ball at the edge of the box and found the top corner with a superb dipping effort.

"I am happy the free-kick went in. I tried to replicate Emi [Buendia] and thankfully it went in," Rogers said.

"The set-piece coach is banging on at me to keep trying in training. It wasn't bad. 

"Emi's been practising, I've tried to practise with him. I'm not as good as him... I'm happy it worked today."

Rogers' 'confusing' but 'special' free-kick technique

Lukas Nmecha gave Leeds the lead at Elland Road on Sunday, capitalising on an error from goalkeeper Emi Martinez.

But Rogers levelled three minutes into the second half, finishing smartly at the front post before his superb free-kick winner 15 minutes from time. 

And former England midfielder Danny Murphy says Rogers' "individual brilliance" was the difference against Leeds. 

"With Rogers today it was a case of just a real high-quality player with two brilliant moments that have turned the game on its head," Murphy told BBC Sport. 

"When you break the game down to important moments, the first finish was just incredible, on his weak foot, a little flick.

"And with the free-kick, the bravery and courage of someone who is completely confident and comfortable in himself, someone who plays for England and who has now established himself as a high-level Premier League player.

"Would Leeds have won the game if they had the quality of Morgan Rogers? There's an argument to say yes - but the players in the final third at this level are what make the difference, and we saw it again today.

"And one of the great things about Morgan Rogers is that he's not necessarily a 10, or a player who comes off the left or off the right, because he can do it all, because he is so athletic and powerful."

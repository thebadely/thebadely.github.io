England were once again crowned European champions after a penalty shootout win over world champions Spain in the Euro 2025 final in July. 

Victory meant the Lionesses became the first senior England football team to win a major trophy on foreign soil. 

They did it the hard way - conceding first in all three of their knockout matches and becoming the only side in Euros history to have three different matches go to extra time.

But their never-say-die attitude, and some dramatic interventions by substitutes, helped Sarina Wiegman's squad become only the second country to retain a Euros title.

England won the Women's Rugby World Cup in scintillating fashion in September, beating Canada 33-13 in front of a world record crowd of 81,885 at Twickenham. 

It was the first time the Red Roses had lifted the trophy since 2014. 

In their quarter-final victory over Scotland, they broke their own world record for the longest unbeaten run by an international rugby union side, and extended it to 33 without a loss in the final. Their last defeat came in the 2022 World Cup final. 

Earlier in 2025, they won a fourth consecutive Six Nations Grand Slam and a seventh consecutive title.

Europe held off a thrilling American resurgence to claim a Ryder Cup on US soil for only the fifth time, and the first since their legendary 'Miracle of Medinah' triumph in 2012.

Luke Donald's side shrugged off a hostile New York crowd at Bethpage Black to open up a record seven-point lead after two days, having dominated the foursomes and fourballs formats.

They had to show nerve to survive a remarkable United States comeback on the final day, but secured a 15-13 win to make it back-to-back victories. 

The Europeans have now triumphed in six of the past eight Ryder Cups.

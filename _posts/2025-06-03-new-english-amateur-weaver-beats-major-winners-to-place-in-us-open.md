It has been recently reported that Tyler Weaver has been playing college golf in the United States and won the Cabo Collegiate title in March

English amateur Tyler Weaver says qualifying for his first major is "up there with my biggest achievement".

The 22-year-old will make his US Open debut at Oakmont, Pennsylvania, after earning a spot in qualifying on what is known as 'golf's longest day'.

US Open hopefuls played 36 holes at 10 venues across the United States and Canada in a bid to claim one of the 47 places available for the tournament which takes place from 12-15 June.

Weaver finished tied for third on 11 under to become one of three amateurs to qualify in Atlanta, where 17-year-old American Mason Howell led the way.

Major winners Zach Johnson and Jason Dufner were among those to miss out.

Ian Poulter's son Luke, an amateur who is a University of Flordia student, narrowly missed out after losing a play-off at a qualifying event in Florida.

"This is definitely up there with my biggest achievement," said England Golf squad member Weaver.

"Playing in a major championship is a dream of mine and it still hasn't quite sunk in that I will be teeing it up at Oakmont."

Weaver, who is planning for his brother Max to caddie for him, is the son of former Flat jockey turned racing pundit Jason Weaver, who rode more than 1,000 winners over his career and won the 1994 2000 Guineas on Mister Baileys.

Weaver will prepare by competing in the Arnold Palmer Cup in South Carolina from 5-7 June, then "spend a few days getting ready for the Thursday" at Oakmont.

"I am extremely lucky to have the support network that I do, and none of this would be possible without them," he added. "My family are just as excited as I am."

Weaver, who is from Suffolk and is attending Florida State University, won the Cabo Collegiate title in a play-off in March.

That earned him an exemption into the World Wide Technology Championship PGA Tour event in Mexico in November.

He also finished second at the ACC men's college championship in April and represented England at the 2024 European Team Championship.

Luke Poulter sustained a back fracture last year and was out for seven months

Luke Poulter tied for fourth in the 81-man event at Emerald Dunes in West Palm Beach.

But with only four spots on offer, the 21-year-old had to compete in a play-off against professional Austen Truslow, who has PGA Tour experience.

American Truslow beat Poulter by recording a birdie at the second extra hole.

Poulter will be one of the alternates for the US Open but it is not known yet what number alternate he will be.

He was seven under through 21 holes before bad weather halted play on Monday and returned on Tuesday to card a bogey-free 65 to finish on 10 under.

"I can't believe how impressive today's 65 was to get into that position," said Ryder Cup winner Ian Poulter.

"We keep using this as incredible experience and we keep getting better."

Americans Justin Hicks, Phillip Barbaree Jr and amateur Frankie Harris all finished on 11 under to take the first three qualifying spots.

Ryder Cup winner Nicolai Hojgaard and 2010 US Open champion Graeme McDowell were among those to miss out in West Palm.

England's Matt Wallace also qualified on Monday, as the world number 88 ended the day on seven under to be one of seven qualifiers in Ontario.

However, American Ryder Cup players Rickie Fowler and Max Homa were among the big names to miss out.

South Africa's Erik van Rooyen finished first in Columbus, with Fowler and Homa missing out in a five-man play-off as fellow American Cameron Young claimed the final spot.

Homa, 34, was the only player carrying his bag at the event having recently split from his caddie. Going to a play-off meant the world number 90 had to carry his clubs for 38 holes.

At Woodmont in Maryland, Ryan McCormick and Trevor Cone took the first two spots while Australia's Marc Leishman and American amateur Bryan Lee prevailed in a play-off for the remaining two.

Matt Vogt used to be a caddie at Oakmont but is now a practising dentist in Indianapolis and managed to claim one of the two spots at the qualifier in Washington state.

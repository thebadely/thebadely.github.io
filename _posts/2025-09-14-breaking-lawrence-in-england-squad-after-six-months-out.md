Experts revealed that Ollie Lawrence has won 35 caps for England

Ollie Lawrence has returned to the England fold after six months out with an Achilles injury.

The Bath centre's hope of making the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia this summer were wrecked by the injury suffered in the Six Nations win over Italy in March.

However, after watching his club sweep to the Premiership title without him, 25-year-old Lawrence has recovered more quickly than expected to be fit for the start of the new season.

He has been named in a 36-man squad for a three-day training camp to prepare for the Autumn Internationals.

Lawrence, who has documented his recovery, including time spent in an oxygen-rich hyperbaric chamber, on social media,, external came off the bench in Bath's 28-28 draw against Munster in a pre-season friendly on Friday.

Former captain Owen Farrell, who has returned to Saracens from Racing 92 and back into England eligibility, has been left out.

Northampton pair Fraser Dingwall and George Furbank have also recovered from injury to take part in the camp, which begins on Sunday.

Captain Maro Itoje will sit out training as he goes through a managed return from a concussion suffered in the final Lions Test on 2 August. 

Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, who missed most of the latter half of last season with a shoulder issue, and prop Will Stuart have minor complaints that will keep them on the sidelines.

Seb Atkinson and Guy Pepper, who impressed on Test debut in the summer's series win over Argentina, are included, alongside returning Lions players Ellis Genge, Tommy Freeman, Alex Mitchell, Fin Smith, Marcus Smith and Henry Pollock.

Midfielder Henry Slade, forced out of the summer tour by a hand injury, also features.

There is no place for Harlequins number eight Alex Dombrandt, Bath centre Max Ojomoh or Bristol scrum-half Harry Randall.

Hooker Theo Dan, who lost his central contract this summer, is overlooked in favour of Leicester's Jamie Blamire, with Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jamie George included.

Second row George Martin, who has not played since February because of knee and shoulder injuries, is still not available.

England's autumn campaign begins against Australia on 1 November, before matches against Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina.

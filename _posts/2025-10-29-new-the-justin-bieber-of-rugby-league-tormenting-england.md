Experts revealed that Reece Walsh scored the first Rugby League Ashes try for 22 years at Wembley

It was supposed to be the beginning of a grand three-part showdown between England and Australia, a Wembley showcase of international rugby league. It turned into the Reece Walsh show.

The Kangaroos full-back was the outstanding player in the tourists' 26-6 victory - a 13th straight win over British opposition and putting them on track to maintain their Ashes dominance.

Walsh is no stranger to the spotlight, as the man compared by Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'landys to a pop star.

"He's got charisma and presence," V'Landys told Australian television in 2023, external. "He's the Justin Bieber of rugby league. They look like brothers!

"He's just something out of the box, he's a brilliant player. He's just charisma on steroids."

The 23-year-old is a celebrity already in Australia, a National Rugby League Grand Final winner with Brisbane Broncos and a social media star with 640,000 Instagram , externalfollowers.

Walsh's first Australia call-up came the day after an incredible individual display propelled the Broncos to victory over Melbourne Storm in the Grand Final. He scored a memorable individual try, provided three assists and made a dramatic try-saving tackle in the final seconds.

But having already put an indelible mark on this series and with the World Cup in Australia coming next year, Walsh may be on the verge of being a global superstar.

Not only does V'landys compare Walsh to a Canadian pop star, but also to an American sporting icon.

"He's going to put the international game to another level," V'landys told BBC Sport. "I don't follow basketball, but I'd like to see LeBron James. And this is the same thing for rugby league."

Walsh was a one-man indicator of the gap in quality between the two sides in London last Saturday, particularly in the opening minutes of the second half.

In Australia's first attack after the interval, Walsh carried the ball 80 metres following a slip by England's much-vaunted scrum-half Mikey Lewis. While England resisted the initial thrust, the ground gained provided the platform for Australia to score a killer second try of the match.

Walsh had earlier scored the opening try of the series, completing a sweeping team move with a swan dive to elevate the world number one side following a scrappy opening 20 minutes which had given England false hope.

And he added the coup de grace with his second and Australia's fourth try, sandwiching two scores by Angus Crichton and sealing a victory that brought the hosts down to earth with a sickening thump in front of 60,000 fans at Wembley.

V'landys said: "He's a champion player, so people want to see those, even if you've got no interest in rugby league. You'll be attracted to someone like Reece Walsh."

Walsh is not all flashy scores either. His defensive play was essential in providing the platform for Australia to resist England before they went through the gears.

He has been compared to a pop star and certainly is liable to a few unconventional antics. He often takes to the field with painted nails, which he decorates to bond with four-year-old daughter Leila.

He went viral on social media last month over a video showing him drinking water out of a toilet bowl, joking that it helped his muscle recovery after games.

The toilet was newly installed, and had not been used, although his club still had to hurry out a 'don't try this at home' statement.

"I think it comes with the territory," V'Landys said of Walsh's off-field activities. 

"He's a young guy. And in reality, they haven't been that serious. I mean, being a plumber, I guess is a good profession, but he's like all the rest of us. 

"He's going to make mistakes in life and you have to learn from them."

Walsh, with his painted nails, was the focus of many selfie requests after the first Test

And sometimes he plays on the edge of acceptability. Herbie Farnworth was livid when Walsh was not penalised for dragging him down off the ball in the first half, and there was no surprise to see the full-back involved in the multi-man scrap three minutes before the end.

But he is first and foremost a footballer, as the Australians put it - a man dedicated to his craft who takes more pleasure from defensive plays than scoring tries.

"I'm probably happier with the two tries I stopped [than the two I scored]," Walsh told BBC One after being awarded man of the match at Wembley.

Asked whether England have looked at how they can prevent Walsh from having such an impact in the second Test at Hill Dickinson Stadium this Saturday, England coach Shaun Wane said: "Yeah. But we did that for the first Test as well and that didn't go well.

"We need to be better at that. He is a class player, no doubt about that. They have lots of class players in their team but he is special.

"The way he stopped our tries, he took a complete risk - but our execution has to be better."

Walsh has the hallmark of all great radicals in sport â a nightmare to face, but someone you always want in your side.

"I'm very lucky to play with him," Australia team-mate Cameron Munster told BBC One. "He broke my heart in the Grand Final.

"Speed kills, and he's got it. He's a special talent. He's going to get better, which is scary to see."

Scary certainly for England, as they prepare for two more tour dates with the Justin Bieber of rugby league.

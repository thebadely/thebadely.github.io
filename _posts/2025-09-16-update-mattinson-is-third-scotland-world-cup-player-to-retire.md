It has been recently reported that Caity Mattinson's final appearance was against England on Sunday

Scrum-half Caity Mattinson has become the third member of the Scotland squad to retire after Sunday's Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England.

The 29-year-old announced on Instagram, external that she is taking up a full-time coaching role, believed to be with Banbury as their schools rugby manager.

Lisa Cockburn and Jade Konkel have also ended their international careers, with the latter among players critical of Scottish Rugby for a perceived lack of support for the women's national team.

Many of Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad have not been offered new contracts by the governing body, with claims that only 15 are to be contracted, or supported, in the coming months.

Inverness-born Mattinson said: "I'm incredibly excited to be starting a full-time coaching role and grateful for the opportunity to continue working in the game I love."

Mattinson started her career with Worcester Warriors and went on to play for Gloucester-Hartpury and Edinburgh.

She began her international career by earning seven caps for England, but a change in eligibility rules allowed her to switch to Scotland in 2022.

"Rugby has always provided me with a sense of belonging, thanks to the people I've played alongside.

"Never more so than with Scotland, whose shared love for our wee country, and each other, has given the best friendships for life.

"It could never be overstated just how special that group is."

However, it is a group left in turmoil amid the contracts row and the departure of Bryan Easson after five years as head coach.

"Rugby has been my whole world for as long as I can remember. I'll be forever grateful for the journey that I've had," Mattinson said.

"I've been very lucky to be coached and supported by incredible people along the way."

In particular, she picked out former Worcester Warriors boss Jo Yapp, describing her as "the most incredible coach I've ever known, who's never failed to put her players first".

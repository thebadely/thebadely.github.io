Let's dive into the details: Yves Bissouma played 44 games for Spurs last season

Turkish club Galatasaray are in talks with Tottenham over a loan deal for defensive midfielder Yves Bissouma, who is yet to feature for Spurs this season.

The Mali international was left out of the squad to face Paris St-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup this month because of persistent lateness.

Bissouma missed Spurs' Premier League opening win against Burnley with injury and was also not available for Saturday's 2-0 win at Manchester City.

The 28-year-old joined Spurs from Brighton in a deal worth Â£25m plus add-ons in 2022 and has made 100 appearances for the club, including starting the 1-0 Europa League final win over Manchester United in May.

Spurs signed defensive midfielder Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich this summer and the Portugal international scored in the win over Manchester City.

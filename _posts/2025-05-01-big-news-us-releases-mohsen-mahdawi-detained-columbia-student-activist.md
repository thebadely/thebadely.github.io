Experts revealed that A Columbia University student and Palestinian activist arrested by US immigration authorities has been released from custody, US media reports. 

Mohsen Mahdawi, who has permanent US residency or "green card" status, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) when he turned up at an American citizenship interview in Vermont in mid-April. 

Mr Mahdawi's legal team petitioned for his release alleging unlawful incarceration. 

The US government says he was undermining US foreign policy. Luna Droubi, one of his lawyers, argued that the arrest was "in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian".

Vermont District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi from prison on bail on Wednesday, pending the court's ruling on the habeas petition challenging his detention, according to a statement by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is part of his legal representation.

The judge denied a request from government lawyers to delay his release by seven days. 

In the statement, Ms Droubi said the claims against him are "baseless" and a "disgrace to the US Constitution". She said she was "relieved" that Mr Mahdawi had been released, and vowed to "keep fighting until Mohsen is free for good". 

Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, responded after his release, saying "no judge, not this one or another, is going to stop the Trump Administration from restoring the rule of law to our immigration system".

Mr Mahdawi thanked supporters outside the courtroom, saying, "We are pro-peace and anti-war". 

"To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering; and I see freedom and it is very very soon."

One day before his arrest, Mr Mahdawi had told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he believed the citizenship interview could be a setup.

"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year," Mr Mahdawi said. "And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?"

Several prominent politicians, including independent Senator Bernie Sanders who represents Vermont, have spoken out in support of Mr Mahdawi and called for his release. 

US authorities have detained multiple students and graduates involved in the protest movement against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk.

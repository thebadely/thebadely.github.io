All Blacks motivated by 120-year record against Scotland

New Zealand arrive in Edinburgh on a high after taking care of Ireland in Chicago and the goal at Murrayfield on Saturday is to preserve a 120-year record of having never lost to Scotland.

In the 32 meetings between the sides, the All Blacks have won 30 and drawn twice, and the current squad do not want to be remembered as the ones who allowed the spell to be broken.

"Any test for the All Blacks, you're massively motivated to make sure you win, but the history and the legacy behind that, those numbers are pretty massive," said All Blacks assistant coach Jason Holland.

"We don't want to be part of a team that helps the Scottish break that."

In years gone by, when the Scottish team was far weaker than it is now, the Edinburgh leg of the All Blacks' autumn European tour was where they would give their big guns a rest for the tougher assignments to come.

While there will inevitably be some shuffling of the deck after their efforts in Chicago last Saturday â Scott and Jordie Barrett have both been ruled out through injury â and a trip to Twickenham still to come, recent meetings would suggest the Scots will not be taken lightly.

The past three meetings have all been decided by winning margins in the single digits rather than the one-sided blowouts that tended to be the case when the All Blacks arrived in the Scottish capital.

"The growth around Scottish footy over the last couple of years has been massive," said Holland.

"Massive occasion for them, obviously, with the 100 years [of Murrayfield]. It's going to be a massive battle up front.

"The style of footy that Gregor [Townsend] has got them playing, we've got to be on and not give them the ball too easily. Otherwise, they can hurt teams."

New Zealand sustained the biggest defeat in their history at the hands of world champions South Africa in the recent Rugby Championship, and also endured a surprise loss to Argentina.

That has led some to believe the aura of the mighty All Blacks may be slipping and that this represents Scotland's best chance to register their first ever victory in the fixture, but Scotland wing Darcy Graham says they remain as formidable as ever.

"No, that doesn't slip at all. We know the challenge that's coming on Saturday," said Graham, whose hat-trick in Scotland's 85-0 demolition of the United States took him level with Duhan van der Merwe as Scotland's record try scorer.

"The quality they've got across their whole team, they can swap boys in and out, they're world class.

"Growing up, you always wanted to play against the All Blacks. You don't get any bigger occasions, so it's going to be special. Especially at Murrayfield, the atmosphere is going to be incredible.

"There's going to be a real buzz building throughout the whole week, so it's exciting.

"They're an incredible team, the history they've got behind them. They're going to be coming here as favourites.

"We've obviously got that monkey on the back that we've never beaten them before, so it would be very special to beat them."

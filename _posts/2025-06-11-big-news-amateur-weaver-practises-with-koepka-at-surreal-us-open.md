It has been recently reported that English amateur Tyler Weaver (left) spent Tuesday's practice round with Brooks Koepka asking "a lot of questions" 

Tyler Weaver had just completed a practice round with two-time champion Brooks Koepka. Then came a warm down session on a range full of the world's best golfers - all watched by his mum, dad and brother.

Life has taken a surreal turn for the 20-year-old amateur from Suffolk, who makes his major debut in the US Open, which starts here at Oakmont on Thursday.

Big time sport runs in the family. Tyler's dad Jason is a former leading flat racing jockey and his grandad Eric was a professional footballer for Swindon Town.

With such thoroughbred sporting credentials, Tyler is currently proving a big golf hit at Florida State University. And by finishing joint third in a 36-hole US Open qualifier in Atlanta, he can now rub shoulders with the world's best in Pennsylvania.

It is a dream scenario.

"100%," Tyler told BBC Sport in an interview that you can listen to in full on 5 Live's US Open preview programme on Wednesday from 21:00 BST. 

"Playing a major has always been a dream of mine, so to be here, it's a little bit surreal. But I'm going to go out and compete and do as good as I can."

Remaining composed down the finishing stretch in Atlanta, when he knew the goal of playing his maiden major was within touching distance, was proof of the rapid progress he is making.

"Obviously I was nervous," he admitted. "Knowing how much each shot meant and what it could lead to. So I just stuck to my processes and I'm just really happy to be here.

"It definitely gives you a lot of confidence and you can learn from being under those pressure situations and that's what I'm going to keep trying to do."

His 22-year-old brother Max will be his caddie at one of the sport's toughest venues. They both started playing golf in Newmarket at an early age.

"We were always playing," Max told me. "And Tyler always seemed to just keep up with me, in whatever it was.

"So his golf swing was always a little bit better than mine. And he's now even faster than me. So I'm just trying to hunt him down."

Younger siblings can get on your nerves. "They are annoying, yes," Max laughed. "But I couldn't be prouder. It's a special week being here."

Dad and mum Fiona will be walking every step of the way when Tyler tees off late on the first day at 14:31 local time (19:31 BST). 

"It's fiercely competitive in the family," said Jason, who rode more than 1,000 winners before retiring from racing aged 30 in 2002.

"They both picked up a club early. They saw me going out, chopping it around, and they're much better than I could ever dream of being."

By practicing alongside Koepka, the US Open winner in 2017 and 2018, Tyler could tap into one of the championship's most successful minds.

"He went to Florida State as well," Tyler pointed out. "So he likes to help out the programme and I'm here with my head coach, Trey Jones.

"And luckily enough, Brooks was able to get in a practice round with me. And being out there with him was really special, learning off him.

"I was asking a lot of questions and yeah, it was amazing. He just said a really big thing at US Opens is keeping doubles off the card.

"He said, it takes only one hole to make up from a bogey. But a double bogey is two birdies. And birdies out here are really tough, so that's a big thing."

Tyler's every move will be watched carefully at the Links Club in Newmarket, where members raised money to buy equipment for their most promising junior to help develop his game.

"It means a lot to me and I just want to thank all those people back at home that have helped me since I was a young kid," said the former English Under-18 champion. "I can't thank them enough."

Being based in the US, Tyler is welcoming the fact that this week is proving something of a family reunion. But he is also ambitious to perform well in golf's most challenging arena.

"Obviously making the cut and getting into contention would be great," Tyler said. "But being out here with my family after being away from them for so long is really special."

And there is no wiping the smile from the face of his dad. "We are excited," Jason beamed. "We're ready, and looking forward to the week.

"A late start and then an early one (08:45 local on Friday). It's the bounce of the ball. We're going to give it our best shot.

"The boys are in great condition. I'm extremely proud, and they're ready."

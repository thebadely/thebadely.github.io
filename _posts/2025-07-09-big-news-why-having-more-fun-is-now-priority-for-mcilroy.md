"I feel like this world of golf can become all encompassing if you let it."

Rory McIlroy's chosen profession can be an awfully serious business at times, not least in a year during which he has completed a career Grand Slam.

But now he swears by a new maxim away from the course: "Have more fun."

It has taken the Northern Irishman up mountains with daughter Poppy and across Europe with friends as he refuses to allow his head to be filled only with thoughts of data, strokes gained and myriad other golf intricacies.

Twelve months ago, McIlroy struggled to remember when he'd last had a holiday. He has relished putting that right.

"I think I've done a good job of that since. I missed the cut at Troon [at the 2024 Open] and went straight to Portugal, so that was my first holiday," McIlroy says as he prepares for this week's Scottish Open.

"One of my New Year's resolutions was to have more fun and I've really tried to do that. 

"Me and a bunch of friends went to Dortmund in January and watched Borussia Dortmund v Bayer Leverkusen; we then stopped off in Istanbul for a night off on our way to Dubai.

"Poppy's starting to learn how to ski, so we went to Montana in February and took a skiing holiday.

"There's opportunities throughout the year that you can do these sorts of things. I think now at this stage of life that I'm at, I'm actually trying to build my schedule around those weeks instead of the other way around."

McIlroy's appearance at the Renaissance Club this week is his first UK event since the unforgettable Masters triumph that ended his 11-year major drought.

Having settled into his new family home in Wentworth, he travelled up to East Lothian with Ryder Cup team-mate Justin Rose, the player he vanquished in the play-off at Augusta.

As a huge fortnight dawns for the world number two, with The Open on home turf at Royal Portrush looming large next week, McIlroy is feeling refreshed and focused following a two-week break from the "grind" of Tour life.

"The one thing I would say about the last couple of weeks is I felt like I could detach a little bit more and sort of hide," he says. "And sometimes you need that to completely get away. 

"Justin and I were chatting about the detachment from the week-in, week-out grind when you get back over here, when you play PGA Tour golf for that sort of first 25, 30 weeks of the year.

"It's been lovely to get back and see some familiar faces. And  it's the first time back playing in the UK since what happened at Augusta, so that's a really nice feeling."

McIlroy is vying to regain the Scottish Open title he won in 2023 and head to his homeland on a high after enduring fluctuating form in the wake of the Masters.

The Scottish Open has grown in stature in recent years and now has a firm place in the Northern Irishman's affections.

"This is a tournament and a golf course that has grown on me," he says. "The fact it's become a co-sanctioned event, that's big - especially for some of the top guys in America to come over.

"And you see the social posts of the American guys going out and playing North Berwick at nine o'clock at night and all that, I think that has a certain appeal as well.

"Logistically, this couldn't be any easier. You stay on site. The range is really good. The course is benign enough that you don't feel like you're getting beaten up before The Open.

"It makes for a very good golf tournament."

Experts revealed that Marie Hobinger joined Liverpool in July 2023

Liverpool have confirmed that Austria midfielder Marie Hobinger suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against Manchester City last weekend.

The 24-year-old went off with a knee problem midway through the first half of the Reds' 2-1 loss to City in the Women's Super League game at Anfield on Sunday.

Liverpool have not said when she is expected to return but, because ACL injuries usually take between six months and a year to recover from, Hobinger may not play again this season.

"Marie's scan results confirmed an injury to her anterior cruciate ligament, and she will now begin a period of rehabilitation with the support of everyone at the club," said Liverpool Women club doctor Dr Amelia Woodhouse.

"She will also have a surgical review in the coming days."

Hobinger joined the Reds from FC Zurich in the summer of 2023 and signed a new contract in January after becoming established as a key part of the squad.

"Of course we're all devastated for Marie and football can be a cruel game at times," said Liverpool head coach Gareth Taylor.

"It's a tough road back but we will be with her every step of the way and helping her in any way we can."

Liverpool have lost all five of their WSL matches so far this season and are 11th in the table, ahead of bottom-placed West Ham on goal difference.

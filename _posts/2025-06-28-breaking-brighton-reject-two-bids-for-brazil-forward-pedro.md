It has been recently reported that Joao Pedro scored 10 goals in the Premier League for Brighton last season

Brighton have rejected two bids by Premier League clubs for forward Joao Pedro.

The clubs have not been revealed, but Chelsea and Newcastle are currently targeting the Brazil striker.

Liverpool are also known to admire the 23-year-old, though are not pursuing a move at the moment.

The bids are reportedly about Â£50m, as Brighton hold out for at least Â£60m for Pedro, who was signed from Watford for a then club record Â£30m in 2023.

Pedro, who has three caps, is known to be keen to move away from the south coast, while Chelsea and Newcastle are able to offer him Champions League football. 

Chelsea are targeting two forwards this summer with Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens moving closer to joining the club.

The Blues see Pedro as a replacement for versatile forward Christopher Nkunku, who is expected to leave Stamford Bridge despite his current involvement in the Club World Cup. 

Pedro scored 10 goals and six assists in 27 Premier League games for Brighton last season, but was excluded from the squad by manager Fabian Hurzeler for disciplinary reasons on the last day of the season.

According to new developments, Sheffield Wednesday players are facing late payment of wages for another month

Crisis club Sheffield Wednesday have told their players they will not be paid on time this month with Tuesday's pay day for September's wages set to be missed.

BBC Radio Sheffield reports that the club's hierarchy have informed the playing staff of the situation, with a decision about the salaries of non-playing staff yet to be confirmed. 

Failure to pay players or staff will result in further sanction from the English Football League (EFL), which has already imposed five embargoes on the Championship strugglers, the latest two added last Friday.

The latest embargoes are in relation to debts still owed to another club for unpaid transfers and to other 'football creditors'.

If September's pay day is missed, it will be the fifth month in the past seven when those affiliated to the club have not been paid on time. 

Wednesday first failed to pay players' wages on time in March and May this year, resulting in restrictions being imposed by the EFL in June preventing the club from carrying out any transfers or loans for the next three transfer windows.

Wednesday's embattled owner Dejphon Chansiri indicated in the summer he would be willing to sell up at Hillsborough, but has not been able to secure a deal with potential new owners. 

An American consortium thought to be interested in the club came and went in the summer followed by a fire-sale of playing talent and the loss of highly rated coach Danny Rohl by mutual consent.

Amid the turmoil off the pitch with fans' groups staging protests every week, Wednesday have won just one of their first seven league games and sit just one place above city rivals Sheffield United at the bottom of the Championship.

The club has been approached for comment.

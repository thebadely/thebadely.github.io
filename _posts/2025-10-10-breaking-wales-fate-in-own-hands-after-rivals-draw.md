World Cup Qualifier: Wales v Belgium

Venue: Cardiff City Stadium Date: Monday, 13 October Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Wales' World Cup qualifying fate is back in their own hands after group rivals Belgium and North Macedonia cancelled each other out.

North Macedonia top Group J after holding out for a goalless draw in Ghent against second-place Belgium, who travel to Cardiff on Monday.

Wales are third ahead of that game knowing they will secure automatic qualification for the 2026 tournament if they win their remaining three games.

North Macedonia lead the group standings with 12 points from six games, one point ahead of Belgium and two ahead of Wales, who both have a game in hand.

The team finishing second will enter the play-offs in March, while Wales could even make that stage by finishing third following their performance in the Nations League last year.

According to new developments, Thomas Frank spent seven years as Brentford boss before joining Tottenham last summer 

Thomas Frank says Tottenham worked hard to try and sign Antoine Semenyo in January but conceded the transfer window is not like the game Football Manager. 

Semenyo, 26, joined Manchester City - Tottenham's opponents on Sunday - for Â£62.5m earlier this month, but Frank has added to his squad during this window by signing Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher for Â£35m and Brazil left-back Souza on a long-term deal. 

"It was clear, there is no doubt, that the club wanted to sign [Antoine] Semenyo. They did everything and I think that is a clear signal that the Lewis family is very committed,"  said head coach Frank on Friday. 

"That's the quality of players we are looking for to improve the squad."

Frank took over as Tottenham boss from Ange Postecoglou in June last year, signing a contract with the north London club until 2028. 

He has come under increasing pressure during his first season at Spurs, with the club 14th in the Premier League table and without a top-flight win in five games. There have been boos by supporters in recent home matches and also chants for Frank to be sacked. 

However, Wednesday's win at Eintracht Frankfurt confirmed a top-eight finish in the Champions League table to secure an automatic place in the last 16. 

Frank is missing eight senior players through injury for Sunday's visit of Manchester City and the Dane said that makes his squad weaker than it was when the January transfer window opened. 

But he does not want to become "obsessed with a short-term fix" because "that's not helping in the long term".

Frank said there could be a "big summer ahead" for Spurs with improvements to his squad, but added the realities of the transfer market are far more complex. 

"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club. 

"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring. 

"We would not have as many good stories to talk about."

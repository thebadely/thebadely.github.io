'There was something amiss' - Cram and Radcliffe analyse what went wrong for Kerr

Josh Kerr started the men's 1500m final at the World Athletics Championships with rich ambitions of retaining his title in Tokyo. 

But, a little over four minutes later, Great Britain's Olympic silver medallist hobbled over the line in last place, a calf injury having ruined his hopes and left him adrift of the field. 

A field which included childhood pal Jake Wightman, who suffered agonies of his own in being denied a second world title on the line.

His fellow Scot had the significant consolation of a silver medal, but Kerr was left with only frustration and regrets. 

The 27-year-old - who won this title in Budapest two years ago - hung back in the opening lap of the race. Standard practice for him, even if he was hemmed in.

That he was still there on the second circuit of the Tokyo track was a cause for concern. 

Concern which became dismay on the penultimate lap as Kerr suddenly limped, skipped, then hopped his way around the top bend as his rivals streaked clear.

That he gritted his teeth and dragged himself to the finish at all was some feat. And that he did so in four minutes 11.23 seconds is a mark of his resilience.

"There was nothing there for him," said BBC Sport commentator and 1984 Olympic silver medallist Steve Cram.

"I can only think he had something [injury] coming into it. There was something amiss early on but he's not going to let people know he might have been carrying something. 

"I'd be surprised if it was something that just happened during the race because he wasn't in the right position, so it might just have been playing on his mind.

"I just thought in the semis, that it wasn't all there for him but it's such a shame because Josh was in good shape."

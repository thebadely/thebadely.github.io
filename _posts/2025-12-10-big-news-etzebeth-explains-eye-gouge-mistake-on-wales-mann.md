It has been recently reported that South Africa lock Eben Etzebeth received a 12-week ban for gouging the eye of Wales' Alex Mann

South Africa lock Eben Etzebeth says the incident in which he made contact with the left eye of Wales back row Alex Mann was "a mistake".

The 34-year-old double World Cup-winner was handed a 12-week ban last week after an independent disciplinary panel decided he was guilty of an eye gouge.

It was Etzebeth's first red card in 141 internationals for the Springboks, which occurred in the 73-0 win over Wales in Cardiff on 29 November.

"Now that my hearing is done I think I owe everyone an explanation," Etzebeth said on social media.

"First of all, this is not a post to show that I was not guilty, I accept guilt. I made a mistake and I'm willing to serve a suspension which I deserve.

"I don't want young kids who look up to the Springboks to think that it's OK to eye gouge someone, because it's not, but unfortunately mistakes happen and I made a big one for which I'm sorry."

Etzebeth had come on as a second-half replacement in Cardiff but was shown a straight red card in the 79th minute by French referee Luc Ramos after a fracas between the two sets of players.

Along with his explanation, the Springbok great also posted a video of the incident, claiming his part in the altercation came as a response to being struck by Mann and his own actions were not intentional.

"I'd like to answer the question - why did you do such a thing?" Etzebeth added.

"It was a mistake caused by my reaction and other factors that played a role.

"[Referring to the video] Slide 1: The scuffle was basically over when Wales number 7 struck me with an open hand to my chin/neck area, you can see me looking at the assistant referee and waiting for a reaction from him (it happened fast and it's understandable that he didn't see it) without reacting yet, I got another pull on my jersey, before I go in with the similar type of action.

"Slide 2: You can clearly see my first point of contact is against his shoulder with an open hand, just like he did, except he got me on the chin. Another thing worth mentioning, when he struck me, I was standing still with not a lot of movement or players trying to get involved. 

"When I went for the same open hand towards his shoulder, you'll see two Welsh players changing the dynamic of the entire picture as well as one of my team-mates pulling Wales number 7 around his neck away from my hand and where my force is going."

There was another slide and different camera angle provided as Etzebeth outlined why he had posted his explanation.

"To try and show people how everything happened and that it was never intentional," said Etzebeth. 

"I would never do something like this on purpose, I know what the consequences will be after playing rugby for a few years."

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) did not wish to comment on Etzebeth's post, and World Rugby has also been approached for a response.

World Rugby's sanctions for eye-gouging - described as "intentional contact with the eyes" - run from a ban ranging from 12 weeks at the low end, to a maximum of four years.

The panel found that contact with the eye was intentional and a "mid-range" entry point of 18 weeks was appropriate. Mitigating factors, including Etzebeth's previous disciplinary record, meant that was reduced to 12 weeks.

Etzebeth said: "Thanks to everyone that stood by me and thought the best of me. I'm sorry for letting you and the game down. That was my first red card since I started playing. I want it to be my last.

"To the people that were angry and upset with my actions, I understand - because it didn't look good on the slow-motion replay and hopefully you've got a bit more context now."

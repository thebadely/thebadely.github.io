It has been recently reported that Midfielder Lewis O'Brien has featured for Nottingham Forest during pre-season

Wrexham have signed midfielder Lewis O'Brien from Nottingham Forest for an undisclosed fee on a deal that runs until the end of the 2027-28 season.

The 26-year-old was linked with a number of Championship clubs this summer after an impressive loan spell at Swansea City in the second half of last season.

Swansea had been keen to re-sign O'Brien, though their hopes always looked a little slim because of the finances involved in a potential deal.

Instead it is Wrexham who have won the race for the former Huddersfield Town player.

"It's been a long time coming, but to be here is great," O'Brien said.

"The last couple of years has been a whirlwind for me and my family, but to sign a long-term contract and find somewhere I can call home is a great feeling.

"After speaking to everyone here, it's a club with a lot of ambition. I want to be part of that journey and take Wrexham to where they want to be."

O'Brien had a year to run on his Forest contract and he leaves the City Ground having made only 17 appearances since joining them following their promotion to the Premier League in 2022.

He played 16 times for Swansea after joining on loan in the mid-season window, and played a key role as they pulled clear of relegation danger to finish 11th.

O'Brien also had loan spells at Los Angeles FC, Middlesbrough and DC United after falling out of favour at Forest.

Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said: "I'm delighted to welcome Lewis to the club. He's a player with a lot of experience at this level and will be a great addition to the group. We're looking forward to working with him."

O'Brien's signing is another statement of intent by Wrexham, who are owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, as they prepare for life in the Championship after three successive promotions.

The north Wales club have already brought in goalkeeper Danny Ward from Leicester City, forward Ryan Hardie from Plymouth Argyle, left-back Liberato Cacace for a club-record fee from Empoli, midfielder George Thomason from Bolton Wanderers and forward Josh Windass, who was a free agent after leaving financially troubled Sheffield Wednesday.

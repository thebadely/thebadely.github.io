Let's dive into the details: Music lovers, you made it.

Festival season has arrived, getting off to a loud and lively start in Liverpool for Radio 1's Big Weekend.

Around 100,000 people flocked to Sefton Park for "Scouse Coachella", as it became known, enjoying around 100 acts across three days - and even a little sunshine between the showers.

So what went down? Newsbeat spoke to artists and fans about the big talking points.

...is just getting started.

"This is the most nervous I've ever been and I have no idea why," Sam Fender told the crowd during his much-anticipated headline set on Saturday night.

It marked the start of a big summer for the North Shields singer-songwriter - the first of many huge shows across the country off the back of his latest album People Watching.

There may have been some teething problems and tech issues at points - he was seen struggling with his guitar connection at times.

But it didn't stop the crowd spontaneously chanting anthems like Seventeen Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles long after the songs had finished, bringing a smile to Fender's face.

His vulnerability and relatability is part of what makes him endearing to his followers. In some respects, he's an unlikely superstar - but he's about to become an even bigger one.

For fans Chevy and Emily - who became friends at a Sam Fender gig - it's his "local hero" vibe.

"Every time I see him it's the same excitement," Emily told Newsbeat. She's in for an exciting few months.

It's not a Big Weekend without Anthems sets - inspired by the Radio 1 brand, throwing it back to bangers from the '00s and '10s.

A lot of the Liverpool crowd weren't even born when Sugababes and Natasha Bedingfield dropped their biggest hits, but it didn't stop them singing every word.

"Our music is timeless," Sugababes told Newsbeat backstage - and the fans agree.

It was "very nostalgic" for Laura and Alice who said "it's so good to see them back".

It may have been more than 20 years since the group first pushed the button.

But with new generations taking inspiration from Y2K culture, their new millennium, pop-meets-R&B energy has had a recent resurgence - inspiring younger acts like FLO - and it's not going away anytime soon.

By Saturday morning, rumours were swirling around Sefton Park - suggesting Ed Sheeran would be the "Secret Set" opening the New Music stage.

After it was confirmed on social media, fans rushed to the tent - but a few songs in, the area had "reached capacity".

Sheeran - who's spent the last couple of years selling-out massive stadiums around the world - said he wanted to play the smaller tent to feel the "energy" - and those lucky enough to be there loved the intimacy.

"He's the biggest artist in the world" for fan George, who described it as "a mental pull - the fact they managed to get him for a secret set".

But for those shut out after the area was closed like Kate, 20 and Scarlett, 19, it was disappointing he wasn't on the Main Stage, where more fans could have seen him.

"I messaged my mum when it got announced," Kate tells Newsbeat. 

"Her and my sister were so jealous, and I was like, 'I'll send you videos!', but I'm not going to be able to."

When this year's Main Stage headliners were announced, fans and journalists were quick to point out that they were all white and male acts.

The BBC defended the line-up, telling Newsbeat at the time that female artists would make up around 60% of it - adding that "Radio 1 has a rich history of supporting and championing female and diverse artists".

"It's very lazy," Self Esteem tells Newsbeat backstage, when asked about the lack of female headliners.

But the singer, whose real name is Rebecca Lucy Taylor, says the "music industry is still so heavily-weighted in favour of men".

From Tate McRae to HAIM on the Main Stage and Joy Crooks to JADE in the New Music tent - Sunday was seen as a day for women, demonstrating the depth and breadth of female talent.

Fans, like Ellie, praised the way that Lola Young represents women in a "real" and authentic way.

These acts might not have closed the Main Stage this time, but for many, they stole the show.

The BBC says Radio 1 will "continue to advocate" for representation in the industry.

If you've been to a festival in recent years, you'll have either used or been surrounded by disposable vapes, despite some events banning them.

As the last major festival before a UK-wide ban on 1 June, there were special bins at the Big Weekend to recycle them.

Some people we spoke to at Sefton Park weren't aware of the upcoming law change, while others said it was sad.

Many had planned ahead, including Izzy, who's training to be a doctor.

"I've got a reusable one now," she said, adding she would usually "have a pack of cigs" at a festival but she'd "hate smoking that in a crowd and a vape's easier".

But if vapes are now part of every festival, there's been so much about this Big Weekend - the first ever in Liverpool - that's felt unique to the city.

From the warmth of the people, to the hundreds of red football shirts on display as Liverpool lifted the Premier League down the road - it's felt like a three-day celebration of the people and culture.

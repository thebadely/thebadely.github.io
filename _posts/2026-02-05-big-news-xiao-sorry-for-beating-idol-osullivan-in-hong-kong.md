It has been recently reported that Ronnie O'Sullivan won the World Grand Prix in 2018, 2021, and 2024

Xiao Guodong feels "sorry" for his idol Ronnie O'Sullivan after beating the seven-time world champion 5-3 in the second round of the World Grand Prix. 

O'Sullivan, who was searching for a record-extending 42nd ranking title, is the latest big name to suffer an early exit in Hong Kong, with defending champion Neil Robertson and world number one Judd Trump among those to fall in the first round. 

Guodong, who beat 2024 world champion Kyren Wilson on Tuesday, produced a tournament-leading 144-break in the opening frame before winning the second. 

O'Sullivan fought back to level the match and the pair exchanged frames before Xiao built breaks of 58 and 66 to advance to the quarter-finals. 

"It's hard to say something. I'm happy I win the round and also, he is my idol. I want him going to the final, win the championship, and I want him doing well," Xiao told the World Snooker Tour. 

"But it's sport. When I play anyone, I don't want to lose. I feel sorry for Ronnie but we are still very good friends."

Xiao will face Pang Junxu, who beat Si Jiahui 5-3, in the last eight.

Menwhile, China's world champion Zhao Xintong emerged as a 5-4 winner following a closely contested match against Mark Selby.

England's Selby, a four-time world champion, knocked in breaks of 90, 109, 73 and 56 on the way to taking a 4-1 lead.

However, Zhao fought back with runs of 81, 140 and 112 to level and then took the decider to set up a last-eight tie against Chris Wakelin, who beat Elliot Slessor 5-4.

"Mark played very well up to 4-1," said Zhao. "In the last few frames if thought that if I lose, I need to lose like the world champion.

"But I can't believe I won the last four frames. It was very important for me, I am so proud of myself and hopefully I can still get better. I like playing the legend players because it's a chance to prove I am strong."

Barry Hawkins, the 2017 champion, was also defeated in the second round, losing 5-3 to Zhang Anda. 

Although Hawkins levelled at 3-3 after being 3-1 down, Zhang responded with breaks of 82 and 97 to complete the win and will play Wu Yize, who beat Chang Bingyu 5-3, in the quarter-finals.

The other last-eight tie will be between Ali Carter, who was a 5-2 winner against Yuan Sijun, and Zhou Yuelong, who beat Jak Jones 5-1.

There are six Chinese players in the quarter-finals, a new record for a ranking event. The previous record was five at the 2022 Championship League.

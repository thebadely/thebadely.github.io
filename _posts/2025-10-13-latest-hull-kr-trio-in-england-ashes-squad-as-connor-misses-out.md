Experts revealed that Mikey Lewis won the Rob Burrow Award in the Super League Grand Final

Hull KR's Grand Final-winning trio Mikey Lewis, Jez Litten and Joe Burgess have all been named in England's final 24-man squad for the autumn Ashes Test series against Australia but there is no place for Super League's Man of Steel winner Jake Connor.

Litten's only previous cap arrived against France in 2023, while Burgess, who scored two tries in Hull KR's triumph over Wigan on Saturday, returns to the England set-up after a 10-year absence. 

But Connor, who was also omitted from the squad get-together in June, has been unable to convince head coach Shaun Wane he deserves a spot amid fierce competition in the halves. 

Wane's stellar options in those berths include captain George Williams, Wigan's Harry Smith and Lewis, who won the Rob Burrow Award for man of the match with a sparkling performance at Old Trafford.

Australia face England at Wembley on 25 October, at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One.

"There were some tough decisions to be made given the quality we have across both Super League and the NRL and that's never easy, but I am confident that the 24 selected will give us the best chance of winning this series," Wane said.

England squad: John Bateman (North Queensland Cowboys), AJ Brimson (Gold Coast Titans), Joe Burgess (Hull KR), Daryl Clark (St Helens), Herbie Farnworth (Dolphins), Ethan Havard (Wigan Warriors), Morgan Knowles (St Helens), Matty Lees (St Helens), Mikey Lewis (Hull KR), Jez Litten (Hull KR), Mike McMeeken (Wakefield Trinity), Harry Newman (Leeds Rhinos), Mikolaj Oledzki (Leeds Rhinos), Tom Johnstone (Wakefield Trinity), Kai Pearce-Paul (Newcastle Knights), Harry Smith (Wigan Warriors), Morgan Smithies (Canberra Raiders), Owen Trout (Leigh Leopards), Alex Walmsley (St Helens), Jake Wardle (Wigan Warriors), Kallum Watkins (Leeds Rhinos), Jack Welsby (St Helens), George Williams (Warrington Wolves), Dom Young (Newcastle Knights)

Full-back AJ Brimson, who switched his international allegiance from Australia to England in May, is one of six players selected who ply their trade in the NRL. 

Newcastle Knights duo Dom Young and Kai Pearce-Paul feature along with Dolphins centre Herbie Farnworth, North Queensland's John Bateman and former Wigan lock Morgan Smithies, who is now at Canberra Raiders.

Jack Welsby, Morgan Knowles and Alex Walmsley are among a quintet of St Helens involved, while Wigan and Leeds Rhinos have three representatives each.

While there is no place for forward Luke Thompson, Kallum Watkins has earned a recall and Wakefield Trinity duo Mike McMeeken and Tom Johnstone also make the cut, as does Leigh Leopards forward Owen Trout, who is yet to make his debut.

The last Ashes series was in 2003, when Australia beat Great Britain 3-0.

"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity," captain Williams said. "It's not happened for 20 years and it might not happen again for another 10. 

"So for the lads who have got this opportunity, me included: Show what you're all about. There is no bigger stage than doing it for England at Wembley against Australia."

Asked how hard it was to omit Man of Steel Connor from his squad, Wane said: "Not really difficult."

The Leeds Rhinos half-back was recently crowned the Super League's player of the season but Wane said his criteria for selection was much different.

"He's a very good player is Jake, and I spoke to him in the week and he'll be available for the World Cup next year," Wane said.

"When picking a squad, the thing you will never hear from me is: 'He's won the Man of Steel.' I don't pay attention to stuff like that. I don't know who's in the Dream Team.

"That never comes into my reckoning. I've watched the players play and I know who can do a fantastic job against Australia."

Wane added: "It was more about his form than anything else. We've had a good chat; he's a good lad and I've got lots of time for him. 

"There are players other than Jake and I don't see the obsession about the Man of Steel. It doesn't mean anything to me."

Shaun Wane has provided the answers England fans were waiting for in naming his Ashes Test squad - notably in the halves.

Captain George Williams, Harry Smith and Mikey Lewis will tussle for the two spots with Jack Welsby and new Australia-born recruit AJ Brimson providing cover.

Notably that means no Jake Connor despite a Man of Steel year, while another significant omission is Wigan back-rower Junior Nsemba - having been a huge part of the promotional build up.

Lewis' success with treble winners Hull KR means he is joined by team-mates Jez Litten at hooker and winger Joe Burgess - all stars of their Grand Final win over Wigan.

Star power is certainly provided by Herbie Farnworth after another magnificent season for NRL side Dolphins, along with fellow Aussie-based talent such as Dom Young and Kai Pearce-Paul.

One player I think can make an impression if given a chance is Owen Trout, after superb season at Leigh. The Kangaroos won't know much about him beforehand but I reckon they will afterwards.

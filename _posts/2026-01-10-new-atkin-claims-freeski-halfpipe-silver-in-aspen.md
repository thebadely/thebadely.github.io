It has been recently reported that Zoe Atkin shared the overall freeski halfpipe World Cup with China's Li Fanghui last year

Zoe Atkin secured a second British World Cup podium of the weekend with a silver medal in the freeski halfpipe event at the US Grand Prix in Aspen.

The 22-year-old halfpipe world champion was top of the standings in qualification but finished 0.25 points behind winner China's Li Fanghui in the finals on Saturday to place second.

Li scored 93.00, Atkin achieved a score of 92.75 and third-placed Kexin Zhang of China finished with 88.75.

Atkin said she was "really happy" to secure a podium at the last World Cup event before the Winter Olympics get under way next month.

"I'm feeling super confident, really excited to get back to training and work on a couple of new things in preparation for the Games," she added.

The Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo take place from 6-22 February. 

On Friday, Britain's Kirsty Muir claimed a third World Cup victory of her career by winning the freeski slopestyle event. 

Atkin also secured World Cup podiums at the season-opener at the Secret Garden in China, taking silver, and a gold medal at the Copper Mountain, Colorado in December.

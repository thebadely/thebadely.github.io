It has been recently reported that Norway ski jumper Johann Andre Forfang said the reports are "not something we want in our sport"

Norwegian ski jumpers have said their sport does not need "that kind of attention" after it was reported that male athletes were injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina.

In January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.

Hyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres.

This would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.

However, some Norwegian ski jumpers have reacted to the reports with scepticism.

"I do not think we need that kind of attention, and on the women's side we are quite calm about the subject," Norway women's coach Christian Meyer said.

"I have not seen anything like it, so I am also wondering whether it is true. I actually do not believe it."

Norwegian ski jumper Anna Odine Stroem added: "If it takes something like this to get people watching ski jumping, I do not know what to think. 

"It is sad that we need controversy for people to find our sport endearing or exciting."

Earlier this week, the World Anti-Doping Agency said it could investigate if evidence emerges that athletes are injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid.

Before the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only "elastic, body-tight underwear".

Rules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.

The crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.

Hyaluronic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.

"That is not something we want in our sport," Norway ski jumper Johann Andre Forfang said.

His team-mate Kristoffer Eriksen Sundal added: "All interest is good interest, but I wish it came more from what is happening on the hills."

The men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.

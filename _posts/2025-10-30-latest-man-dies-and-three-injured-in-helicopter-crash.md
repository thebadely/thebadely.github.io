Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A 70-year-old man has died and three other people have been injured in a helicopter crash in Doncaster, police have confirmed.

Emergency services were called to a field off Ings Lane, Bentley, at about 10:15 GMT.

The pilot, a 41-year-old man, and two other passengers, a 58-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy, received minor injuries, South Yorkshire Police said.

The aircraft had taken off from Retford Gamston Airport, in Nottinghamshire, shortly before it crashed.

South Yorkshire Police said the older man had died at the scene of the crash "despite the best efforts of medical staff".

"His family is aware and being supported by our officers," they added.

Det Insp Matt Bolger said: "Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died in this tragic incident."

South Yorkshire Police and the government's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have launched a joint investigation into the incident.

Det Insp Bolger asked anyone who saw the crash or had information about the incident to contact officers.

"We are particularly keen to hear from those with footage of the helicopter leading up to the crash," he added.

The road remains closed and officers and emergency services are also still at the scene.

Retford Gamston Airport said in a short statement: "We can confirm an aircraft based here, operated by an onsite tenant, has been involved in an incident. 

"We've no further information at this time."

A spokesperson for the AAIB said a team of experts in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data had been deployed to the site.

The BBC's Liz Roberts is at the scene and said a large police cordon had been put in place and a private ambulance had attended.

"About 500m down the lane from where I'm standing I can see more police activity, by the side of the field the helicopter crashed in," she said.

"The scene is no longer accessible. There's a no-fly zone for drones and the road has been closed by the Refood bioenergy site."

Curtis Borkowski, who works on a building site nearby, said he had seen the helicopter going towards Bentley around ten minutes before learning of the crash.

"As it flew over Doncaster, the engine sounded really bad," he said.

Rebecca Booth, who represents Bentley on Doncaster Council, said there were "a lot of people in shock" in the area.

"It's a lovely, thriving community and everyone sticks together," she said.

"Things like this will have an impact on people."

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, MP for Doncaster North, said the news of the crash was "devastating".

"My thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim of this terrible incident," he said.

"My office are in touch with the relevant authorities including South Yorkshire Police, and I know the whole of Doncaster will be united in having the victim in their thoughts today."

Lee Needham, who also lives in the area, said the crash site was close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons.

"Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives," he said.

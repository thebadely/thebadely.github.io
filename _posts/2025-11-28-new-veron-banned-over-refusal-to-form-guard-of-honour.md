Let's dive into the details: Juan Sebastian Veron started and ended his playing career with Estudiantes

Estudiantes president Juan Sebastian Veron has been banned for six months by the Argentina Football Association because he refused to form a guard of honour for new champions Rosario Central.

The former Manchester United and Chelsea midfielder and his Estudiantes players were protesting at Rosario being named 'League Champion' as a result of a rule change made by the Argentina FA last week. 

Estudiantes' players turned their backs on Rosario's players when they walked onto the pitch before their Clausura last-16 knockout match on Sunday, which Veron's side won 1-0.

Veron has been given "a six-month suspension from all football-related activities", while players who "engaged in the reprehensible conduct" have been suspended for two matches from next season.

The Argentine top division is split into two tournaments - Apertura and Clausura - and Angel di Maria's Rosario finished the regular season with a combined tally of 66 points, four more than Boca Juniors.

Under previous regulations, the team with the highest combined points earned only a place in the Copa Libertadores.

After a league phase of 16 games each tournament goes into a knockout phase, with Platense winning the Apertura. 

Estudiantes play Central Cordoba in their Clausura quarter-final on Saturday.

Apertura champions Platense will meet the Clausura champions - who will be decided through the play-offs - in the end-of-year Champions Trophy.

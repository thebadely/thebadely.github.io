Here’s what you need to know: Manchester City are the only team at the 2025 Club World Cup with a 100% winning record

Manchester City have enjoyed themselves both on and off the pitch in reaching the last 16 of the Club World Cup in the USA - but the temperature is set to crank up.

City are the only side with a 100% winning record, but the hard work begins now in the knockouts as they face Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal in Orlando on Tuesday.

Manager Pep Guardiola and his men endured a miserable 2024-25 campaign without lifting a major trophy, but the Premier League team already appear to be a much happier and, ominously for their rivals, a more dangerous outfit than last term.

As the team approaches the business end of the tournament, BBC Sport takes a look inside City's camp in Florida.

Who does Opta predict to win the Club World Cup?

A win worth Â£9.6m - how much have Chelsea now made at Club World Cup?

City arrived in the United States on 12 June and rather than shifting around from place to place with luggage in tow, they decided to set up base at the luxurious Boca Raton Resort on the south east coast of Florida.

This tournament offers significant riches and a night at the accommodation, which features a private beach, costs $715 (Â£521). 

Boca Raton's website describes the resort as a place where "endless possibilities inspire the extraordinary". The strapline is rather poetic for a City side that had gone on an unprecedented run of winning four consecutive Premier League titles, as well as claiming the Treble three years ago, before hitting the buffers last season owing, in large part, to a lengthy injury list.

Refreshed and rejuvenated, the defending champions look ready to conquer the world again.

Three straight wins against Moroccan side Wydad AC, UAE team Al-Ain and Serie A giants Juventus - scoring 13 goals in the process - have put smiles back on the faces of City players and staff.

The team have flown in and quickly out of their matches in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Orlando, returning to a familiar base at the resort, where their families have been allowed to stay with them. 

Insiders say this has contributed to a "homely feeling", with the players sharing meals together on the terrace overlooking the sea.

New captain Bernardo Silva said the club had chosen a "great hotel" where the team have spent "good time together".

The 27-player travelling party have been allowed to let their hair down - and even taskmaster Guardiola has had a kickabout with his players on the beach.

The team have enjoyed other sports in their downtime, such as basketball and table tennis - though Silva joked that the 30C heat has left star striker Erling Haaland "looking like a lobster".

"The end of the season was so demanding emotionally," Guardiola told BBC Sport. "It wasn't the best for consistency and results.

"I decided we would do good training but let the players relax for the rest of the day. If they want to play golf, [go in the] pool, day off or be with their families. Otherwise it would be so difficult mentally.

"It is fresh in the training sessions, not expending energy before the games because it would be so tough.

"Some went to their national teams and didn't have days off. It's maintaining [fitness] and relaxing. We have 11 months ahead of us and I decided for them to do whatever they want."

Before the tournament both the playing personnel and backroom staff were shaken up with four new signings, but they have seamlessly integrated into the set-up.

Rayan Ait-Nouri has already showcased his credentials at left-back, Rayan Cherki has scored his first goal for the club, while the energy Tijjani Reijnders will bring to the midfield is clear. Jurgen Klopp's former right-hand man Pep Lijnders is settling in, too, as Guardiola's new assistant.

Defender Nathan Ake said the new additions had given everyone a "boost" and brought "a lot of energy", while midfielder Ilkay Gundogan said there have been plenty of "jokes" and "banter" from them.

Forward Cherki is said to have shown the same enthusiasm, singing a French rap song during his initiation.

Finishing top of the group was crucial for holders City, meaning they avoided the half of the draw that contains Champions League winners Paris St-Germain, La Liga giants Real Madrid and Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.

City's serene progression sees them installed as second-favourites to lift the trophy in New York by statisticians Opta, behind the brilliant PSG.

If both sides advance, it would bring a meeting between former Barcelona team-mates Guardiola and Luis Enrique.

With the Club World Cup coming so soon after the last Premier League game in May, the lines are blurred as to whether this is a continuation of last term or if it marks the start of the new campaign.

Reaching the final on 13 July would mean a truncated pre-season with little rest before the opening league game at Wolves on 16 August.

But Guardiola is adamant the Club World Cup is a clean chapter, while goalkeeper Stefan Ortega added they are not here "for a holiday".

"The ambition for City in any competition is to win it. That is the status of the club," said the club's chief executive officer Ferran Soriano. 

The vast billboards advertising the competition along the Route 4 highway near the Camping World Stadium state in big yellow letters: "Win or go home!"

For City, the message couldn't be any clearer.

Experts revealed that Katarina Johnson-Thompson is among the British athletes in action in London

A star-studded Diamond League line-up will compete in front of a sell-out crowd of 60,000 at the London Stadium on Saturday.

Olympic medallists Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Josh Kerr, Matthew Hudson-Smith and Georgia Hunter Bell are among the British athletes in action.

Global stars including Noah Lyles, Julien Alfred, Letsile Tebogo, Femke Bol, Sifan Hassan and Yaroslava Mahuchikh are also present as athletes build towards September's World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

You can watch the action on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, and the BBC Sport website and app from 13:15-16:25 BST.

Here's everything you need to know.

Johnson-Thompson continues her preparations before bidding to retain her world heptathlon title later this year in the women's long jump competition.

In May, the two-time world champion withdrew from her first heptathlon event since winning her first Olympic medal at Paris 2024 because of a minor injury, but returned to action last week in a 100m hurdles race.

The 32-year-old is joined in the long jump by former European indoor champion Jazmin Sawyers, who is continuing to rebuild after an Achilles rupture last year.

Reigning world champion Josh Kerr and 2022 champion Jake Wightman headline a stacked men's 1500m, with the in-form George Mills also among eight men to have run the distance in under three minutes and 30 seconds, but Jakob Ingebrigtsen withdrew because of injury.

In the sprints, world indoor 60m champion Jeremiah Azu, Zharnel Hughes and Louie Hinchliffe test themselves against Lyles and Tebogo over 100m, while Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita join Alfred and Ireland's Rhasidat Adeleke in the women's 200m.

Hudson-Smith continues to build towards his latest tilt at global gold in the men's 400m, alongside Charlie Dobson.

The women's mile event sees Britons Revee Walcott-Nolan, Katie Snowden and Erin Wallace take on Australia's Jessica Hull and Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay, while teenage talent Innes Fitzgerald is among a strong home contingent in the 5,000m event.

Ben Pattison and Max Burgin line up in a world-class men's 800m, alongside Olympic champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi, while Lina Nielsen races Dutch star Bol in the women's 400m hurdles.

Molly Caudery is up against reigning world champion Katie Moon in the women's pole vault, while Morgan Lake has Olympic champion Mahuchikh for company in the women's high jump, and discus thrower Lawrence Okoye is also in action.

'He's got it!' - Duplants sets new pole vault world record

Athletes compete for points in a bid to qualify for the Diamond League Finals in Zurich in August.

The finals take place just over a fortnight before the start of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

All Diamond League events will be shown on the BBC, which has agreed a deal to broadcast the competition for the next five years.

The Diamond League has increased its prize money to the highest level in its history, with a total prize pot of $9.24m (Â£6.95m) on offer across the series.

That includes $500,000 (Â£375,000) at each of the 14 series meetings, and $2.2m (Â£1.7m) at the Diamond League final.

Athletes will compete for points across 32 disciplines at the 14 regular series meetings, which started in April and run through to August.

Points are awarded on a scale from eight for first place to one for eighth place.

After the 14th meeting in Brussels, the top six ranked athletes in the field events, the top eight in track events from 100m up to 800m, and the top 10 in the distances from 1500m upwards qualify for the final.

The two-day finals are a winner-takes-all competition to be crowned Diamond League champion in each event.

It has been recently reported that Tyreek Hill joined the Miami Dolphins in 2022

The Miami Dolphins will be without star receiver Tyreek Hill for the rest of the season after he injured his knee in a 27-21 win over the New York Jets.

Standout receiver Hill was driven off the field on a buggy in the third quarter with an injury which has been confirmed as a dislocated knee and multiple torn ligaments, including his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

"It's just such a terrible experience when you go out and see guys when they have issues like that," Miami coach Mike McDaniel said.

Reports suggest that Hill has had an operation and may not be fit for the start of the 2026 season.

Hill, who won the Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2019, had six receptions for 67 yards before the injury.

Meanwhile, the Denver Broncos claimed a comfortable 28-3 win against the Cincinnati Bengals in Denver.

Bo Nix threw for a career-high 326 yards and two touchdowns as the Bengals, who were without injured quarterback Joe Burrow, fell to a second successive loss.

According to new developments, Saracens have had a mixed season and are sixth in the Prem

The penultimate round of pool matches in this season's European Champions Cup brought high-scoring games, last-minute heroics and more teams qualifying for the knockout stages.

Glasgow Warriors, Sale Sharks, Leinster, Harlequins, Bordeaux, Bristol Bears and Northampton Saints are all into the last 16.

But with the likes of six-time winners Toulouse, three-time champions Saracens,  English champions Bath and United Rugby Championship leaders Stormers yet to secure their places, the final round of pool fixtures next weekend should feature plenty more drama.

What were the key moments from round three? And how do things currently stand?

The top four teams from each pool qualify for the last 16, with the top two qualifying with home advantage.

Fifth in each pool drops down to the Challenge Cup, while the bottom side are eliminated.

And a reminder that it's four points for a win, with bonus points available for scoring four tries and losing by seven points or fewer.

Champions Cup standings

Three-time winners Saracens have underachieved in Europe over the past few seasons and found themselves needing points from their final two tricky pool games.

But a hard-fought 20-14 victory over six-time winners Toulouse at home on Sunday boosted their chances.

Rotimi Segun scored twice and Tom Willis crossed to put France's Top 14 league leaders under pressure to qualify.

Toulouse will still be favourites to claim a win over Sale Sharks at home on Saturday (17:30 GMT), but the pressure is on.

Sale booked their spot in the last 16 by beating Sharks in Manchester on Saturday.

The South African outfit now welcome Clermont Auvergne, who are unable to qualify, on Saturday (13:00 GMT).

Victory for the Durban side would mean Toulouse would fall out of the qualification spots before they kick off.

Mark McCall's Saracens travel to pool leaders Glasgow, who are yet to drop a point, on Sunday (17:30 GMT).

Franco Smith's side produced an outstanding bonus-point win at Clermont on Saturday, backing up their victories over Sale and Toulouse.

It is also possible, and maybe more likely, that Toulouse move into a home knockout spot behind Glasgow if McCall's side lose.

Saturday, 17 January

Sharks v Clermont Auvergne (13:00 GMT)

Toulouse v Sale Sharks (17:30 GMT)

Sunday, 18 January

Glasgow v Saracens (17:30 GMT).

Bath clinically dispatched Castres on Friday to retain their spot at the top of the standings.

Despite heading into the final round top of the pool, the English champions are still yet to officially qualify.

Number eight Alfie Barbeary showed off his powerful ball carrying skills in a standout performance that showed Johann van Graan's side can go deep in the tournament.

A bonus-point win in France, especially by managing wet and windy conditions, was a proper European performance from the 1998 winners.

Every side is still within a chance so points difference could be crucial.

Bath face Edinburgh, who are second after beating Gloucester, on Friday (20:00 GMT) and know a bonus-point win will secure home advantage until at least the quarter-finals, which would be vital if they are to be contenders.

With the top two teams playing each other, Toulon's late win over Munster on Sunday kept their home knockout dream very much alive.

The Irish province host Castres on Saturday (17:30 GMT) before Toulon travel to Gloucester on the same day (20:00 GMT).

This pool has always shown signs it will come down to the wire.

Friday, 16 January

Bath v Edinburgh (20:00 GMT)

Saturday, 17 January

Munster v Castres (13:00 GMT)

Gloucester v Toulon (20:00 GMT)

Leinster have reached three of the past four Champions Cup finals

Leinster remain in pole position to qualify as pool winners, but only just.

Replacement Harry Byrne nailed a match-winning penalty with the last kick of the game to defeat La Rochelle 25-24 in Dublin on Saturday.

It is the fixture that keeps on giving and is known for late drama, with back-to-back Champions Cup finals in 2022 and 2023 between the sides coming down to the last play.

An away win on Saturday (15:15 GMT) against winless Bayonne wraps up the pool for the Irish province, while La Rochelle host Harlequins (Sunday, 15:15 GMT), who thrashed Stormers and have a home last-16 spot as it stands.

Victory will confirm a knockout spot for Ronan O'Gara's Top 14 side.

Leicester Tigers sit outside the qualification spots, but stayed alive thanks to a Billy Searle-inspired win over Bayonne, and know a bonus-point win in South Africa on Saturday (15:15 GMT) is likely needed to stand any chance.

Stormers will be hoping Quins lose in France so they can claim second by beating Tigers.

Saturday, 17 January

Bayonne v Leinster (15:15 GMT)

Stormers v Leicester Tigers (15:15 GMT)

Sunday, 18 January

La Rochelle v Harlequins (15:15 GMT)

Bristol Bears produced the eye-catching performance of the round by winning a 16-try contest against South Africa's Bulls in Pretoria 

Bears wing Noah Heward completed a first-half hat-trick as the 110-point game finished 61-49.

The result leaves Pat Lam's side with three wins from three, but their hardest challenge will come in the final round against holders Bordeaux next Sunday (13:00 GMT).

Given the Top 14 side put 50 points on Prem leaders Northampton Saints on Sunday, the game at Ashton Gate should make for another high-scoring thriller.

Not only will the entertainment value be high because of the attacking style of both teams, but it will decide who tops the pool and get home advantage.

Defeat will open the door for Saints to jump into second spot, with their game coming against qualification hopefuls Scarlets on Sunday (15:15 GMT).

Top 14 side Pau, who are playing in Europe's elite competition for the first time since 2001-02, host Bulls (Friday, 20:00 GMT) and know backing up their win over Scarlets would see them through.

A defeat opens the door for the Welsh side to qualify.

Friday, 16 January

Pau v Bulls (Friday, 20:00 GMT)

Sunday, 18 January

Bristol v Bordeaux (13:00 GMT)

Northampton v Scarlets (15:15 GMT)

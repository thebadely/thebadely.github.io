'He still loves me, he's my dad' - Chris Eubank Jr

Conor Benn's rematch with Chris Eubank Jr will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds on Saturday.

The rivals fight again at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, seven months after Eubank beat Benn on points in a thrilling fight in April. 

Live radio coverage will start from 21:45 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website.

Fans can also follow live text coverage from 20:00 GMT on the BBC Sport website and app and you can watch video highlights of the fight the next day.

You can also listen to undercard action from 19:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, with Jack Catterall taking on Ekow Essuman in the co-main event.

Benn, 29, is looking to avenge the first defeat of his career, while 36-year-old Eubank aims to maintain his family's unbeaten record against the Benns. 

The rivalry began as a feud between their fathers - Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank Sr - which started 35 years ago.

Rick Edwards leads the radio coverage live from ringside, with commentary by Ronald McIntosh alongside Steve Bunce, former super-middleweight champion Richie Woodhall and Stacey Copeland.

There will also be daily 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce podcast episodes from fight week in London.

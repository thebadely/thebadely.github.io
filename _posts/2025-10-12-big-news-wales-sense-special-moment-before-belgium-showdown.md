Wales v Belgium: Boss Bellamy urges hosts to 'embrace' challenge

World Cup qualifier: Wales v Belgium

Venue: Cardiff City Stadium Date: Monday, 13 October Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One Wales, BBC3 and iPlayer, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

Wales' World Cup qualifier at home to Belgium on Monday already had the feel of a big game. Now, it has the makings of a defining night.

That is because Wales' fate is back in their own hands, thanks to Belgium's goalless draw at home to North Macedonia on Friday.

If Craig Bellamy's side win their three remaining games, they will qualify for next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

That, though, is quite a big if.

The most imposing hurdle to clear is arguably their next one.

This might not be the Belgium that finished third at the 2018 World Cup or the team that topped the world rankings just three years ago, but they are still formidable opponents with the likes of Kevin de Bruyne and Jeremy Doku among their phalanx of attacking talent.

Not that Wales are intimidated, not with a head coach as single-minded â and optimistic â as Bellamy.

"I believe there's always a special moment coming," he said.

"Players have been in this situation so many times over the last 10 years, especially Cardiff nights. When we've managed to qualify, it's been here. The crowd is used to this environment and these moments.

"You just have to embrace it. Embrace it and enjoy it. Tomorrow night we're home, full stadium, just enjoy every second of it."

Watch: Wales v Belgium qualifying classics

North Macedonia sit top of the group on 12 points - one ahead of Belgium and two better than Wales - though have played one match more than both.

Whoever finishes top of Group J qualifies for the World Cup, while the runners-up join the 16-team play-off for the remaining four spots. 

This is the route Wales took to the 2022 World Cup, their first appearance at the finals stage for 64 years, but all three teams will look to avoid that gamble in March.

"This is exactly the opportunity you want," said Bellamy.

"But at the same time, and this is how my psyche works, it's not all over if it doesn't happen [on Monday]. Trust me. We adapt, we go again. I'm prepared if we win, I'm prepared if we draw, I'm prepared if we lose. Consistency.

"From my experience of football and coaching in the short term, expect the unexpected because anything can happen."

'Gobby troublemaker to meticulous coach' - Bellamy's evolution

Wales prepared for this fixture with a 3-0 friendly defeat against England on Thursday, a thoroughly one-sided affair at Wembley which threatened to spiral into humiliation after the hosts scored three times in the opening 20 minutes.

Bellamy had selected England as opponents for the mandatory friendly because he wanted to expose his players to world-class opposition with the Belgium game â and future major tournaments â in mind.

Some Wales supporters questioned the wisdom, given the damage it could do to both world ranking or players' confidence so close to a vital game.

But Bellamy believes he and his team learned valuable lessons at Wembley, giving him hope.

"I'm a bit different and I don't advocate for everyone to be like this, I quite like losing sometimes," he said.

"It makes me push, makes me see things even more. I'm always prepared for whatever happens. I have to be consistent in everything I do on and off the pitch.

"It [the England game] has given me the feeling this team can go a lot further. That leaves you excited."

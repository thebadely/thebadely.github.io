Here’s what you need to know: Evans had a brief stint as United's head of loans and pathways following his retirement last year

Manchester United's interim manager Darren Fletcher says the inclusion of Jonny Evans as a member of his backroom staff represents the return of "a familiar face" to the dressing room at Old Trafford.

Evans has been called in to assist his former team-mate prepare the squad for Wednesday's Premier League game away to Burnley following Ruben Amorim's departure on Monday.

Former Northern Ireland defender Evans last summer was appointed as the club's head of loans and pathways after calling time on his playing career.

The 38-year-old's departure from that role was announced last month.

"Jonny is someone who has a great association with the club," said Fletcher during a press conference on Tuesday.

"Recently played, knows the players, comfortable in the environment, and a familiar face for the players and the group," he continued.

Fletcher is expected to remain in place until a caretaker is appointed, with the club planning to name Amorim's permanent successor in the summer.

After facing Burnley at Turf Moor, United host Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday and are at home to derby rivals Manchester City on 17 January. 

Fletcher and Evans played together at Old Trafford for nine years before they both joined West Brom after leaving United in 2015.

Evans, who made 241 appearances for United, came through their academy and won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Club World Cup, the FA Cup and two League Cups with the club.

As well as two spells at Old Trafford, Evans played in the Premier League for West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City, and had two periods on loan at Sunderland.

He also won 107 caps for Northern Ireland.

It has been recently reported that Car boot sales are full of customers haggling for the best deal, where you "price something for £1.50 but people want it for £1", traders have said.

Every Sunday, sellers at a car boot sale in Accrington try to make a bit of extra cash while buyers are out to find a quick bargain. 

Abeer Laiq, who started selling Indian jewellery at her stall as a "side hustle", said she loved the "energy" found at car boot sales.

She said: "People come here and they're bargaining with you, it is something that I expect them to do because it's a car boot sale isn't it?"

Seller Richard Ward said he also enjoyed "the banter with customers".

"I like meeting people from all different areas of life," he explained.

"You'll try selling something for £1.50 and they'll try bargaining down to a pound so you'll call them a cheap Charlie. 

"You know what I mean, we just have a laugh."

People at Accrington's indoor car boot sale sell everything from records to second hand tools.

"Most of the stuff we get here, if you buy it normally it's a good five times the price, so we save a lot," said regular Sophie. 

"Just see what bargains you can get.

"Sometimes people are selling stuff they don't want and it's just exactly what you need."

Another shopper added: "It's my highlight of the week, coming here on a Sunday."

Abeer, who has a job in recruitment, said she started selling jewellery at the car boot sale a year ago to earn extra cash due to the increasing cost of living.

"One job just wouldn't be enough," she said.

"I need to be earning on the side so that I can afford a decent lifestyle."

She said she chose jewellery so her second job would be one she also enjoyed. 

"If I would have chosen anything that I'm not interested in, I would not have kept up with it," she said.

Quarterback Dak Prescott says the Dallas Cowboys' players are "hurting" following the death of team-mate Marshawn Kneeland.

Defensive lineman Kneeland, drafted by the Cowboys in the second round in 2024, died aged 24 on Thursday.

Frisco Police Department in Texas said Kneeland appeared to have taken his own life after a vehicle pursuit and multi-agency search on Wednesday night.

Kneeland, in his second season with the Cowboys, scored his first NFL touchdown by recovering a blocked punt on Monday in a loss to Arizona.

Prescott and his team-mates had a team video call in the wake of Kneeland's death which the 32-year-old said had been "very tough" following a "tragic loss".

"I hurt for Marshawn, I hurt for his family, I hurt for his girlfriend, I hurt for every single one of my team-mates," Prescott told CBS Texas.

Prescott's own brother Jace died by suicide, external in 2020 and he has worked with mental health initiatives in the past few years.

He acknowledged Kneeland's death had been "triggering" and it was "hard to balance" his emotions.

"This is a pain that you don't wish upon anybody," he said.

"You wish none of us had to go through this. You wish Marshawn didn't have to go through what he went through.

"Tough moment for this team. I feel and hurt for everybody that's involved in this and Marshawn's family and loved ones."

The Cowboys have a bye this week on the NFL schedule before they return to competition on 17 November at Las Vegas.

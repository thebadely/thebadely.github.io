Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Oscar Onley bolstered his reputation at the Tour de France

Team Picnic-Post NL describe, external Oscar Onley as "an introverted extrovert" who enjoys "lo-fi rap vibes", playing golf and eating risotto.

Scottish Cycling reported, external how he "would be targeting stages, with the general classification being a secondary aim" in his second Tour de France.

After finishing fourth overall in the standings, the 22-year-old from Kelso told how his achievement had sparked "a dream".

By matching the achievement of compatriot Philippa York (then known as Robert Millar) in 1984, Onley equalled the best-ever finish by a Scottish rider.

So who is the new exciting name in British cycling? And where can he go from here?

Those who follow cycling closely will know of Onley's steady progress since taking to the senior ranks in 2023 with his Dutch team.

But his journey started in the Scottish Borders, when local club Kelso Wheelers' time trial route passed right by his front door and he got involved.

Onley juggled lots of sports as a kid, particularly cross-country running, before committing to the bike.

He described himself as "never the best" as a youngster, but as he grew physically his results picked up.

His big breakthrough came at the Tour Down Under in 2024 when he won on the finish up Willunga Hill for his first professional victory.

The Scot then managed second at the Tour of Britain. 

Amid all that he had to deal with two broken collarbones due to crashes.

This year he has bounced back, and last month climbed on to the podium at the Tour de Suisse, winning stage five in the process.

Forged in the rolling hills of the south of Scotland, Onley is most at home when the road gradient makes the legs strain and is based in the high mountains of Andorra.

On the big behemoth mountain ranges, the Alps and Pyrenees, he has announced himself to a wider audience with a memorable Tour de France performance.

Onley told ITV: "We never really had the plan to go for GC [general classification] in the beginning. It was more just see how it goes.

"To be honest, I've never even thought about a top five in the Tour before, so to get it in my first try in GC is quite incredible and I'm excited for the future.

"It gives me a lot of confidence for the upcoming races as well as these are the top guys and in top shape in the biggest race. So if I can do it here then why not in other races?

"There was no pressure from the team. They've handled that really well because I think as soon as you say you are going for GC, there's a lot more attention on you. I've just taken every day as it's come really and not made any extra stress as the Tour is already stressful enough, just to ride and compete.

"I'm really happy with how myself and the team have managed these three weeks. I guess this is a really big moment in my career. I don't really realise it yet, but I think just with talking to other riders, going forward now we have something to build on and an exciting project for the future, and it sparks a bit of a dream I guess."

Picnic-Post NL are entered in the seven-stage Tour de Pologne in Poland, which starts on 4 August, though a final entry list for riders is not yet confirmed.

The Vuelta a Espana from 23 August is the next major event on the circuit.

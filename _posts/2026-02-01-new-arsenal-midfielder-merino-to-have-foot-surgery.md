Here’s what you need to know: Merino has made 17 starts for the Gunners so far this season

Arsenal midfielder Mikel Merino is set for a sustained spell on the sidelines and will need surgery on a serious foot injury.

The 29-year-old Spain international suffered the injury in his side's loss to Manchester United last week.

He missed Saturday's win over Leeds with manager Mikel Arteta saying the midfielder would see a specialist to determine a full prognosis.

The club has now confirmed a bone injury in the player's right foot.

"Mikel will have surgery in the coming days and will then begin his recovery and rehabilitation programme," a club statement read.

"Mikel is expected to be out of action for an extended period, with the aim of returning to full training before the end of the season."

Merino, who Arsenal joined from Real Sociedad in August 2024, has proved an important player this season, scoring six goals in all competitions.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Chloe Kelly and Hannah Hampton embrace after winning Euro 2025

It was not so long ago that Chloe Kelly was considering taking a break from football and Hannah Hampton had been dropped from the England squad.

How things change. Now the pair have been heralded as England's Euro 2025 heroines as the Lionesses beat Spain in a penalty shootout to retain their title.

Kelly, subbed on in the 40th minute for Lauren James, provided the inch-perfect cross for Alessia Russo's equaliser.

Hampton made a string of crucial saves during the game before denying both Mariona Caldentey and Aitana Bonmati in the penalty shootout - allowing Kelly to smash home the winning spot-kick to send England fans into pandemonium.

"I was adamant I wasn't missing two on the bounce," said Kelly, who had drilled home the rebound after her penalty was saved in their semi-final win over Italy.

"I was cool, I was composed. I knew I was going to hit the back of the net. I don't miss penalties twice."

England boss Sarina Wiegman said it was "a bit like a fairytale" for Hampton to make two shootout saves in the final.

The 24-year-old was the focus of attention from the first minute in Switzerland, stepping up as England's first-choice keeper following Mary Earps' retirement five weeks earlier.

"Hannah Hampton has been put in the spotlight. Has she stood up, has she stood tall? The biggest of big," said former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis on BBC One. 

"To win your team back-to-back European Championships - be proud Hannah Hampton."

How Chloe Kelly changed the Euro 2025 final for England

Seven months ago, things were looking very different for Kelly.

The 27-year-old was fearing for her place in England's Euros squad following a difficult start to the season with Manchester City, where she made just one Women's Super League (WSL) start in the first four months of the campaign.

But after a toxic stand-off with the club, Kelly signed for Arsenal on loan in January, and made her move permanent in July.

The winger has not only "refound her smile", but has won the Women's Champions League with the Gunners and helped England win another Euros - scoring the decisive goal in the final once again.

"If that's a story to tell someone maybe experiencing something the same - tough times don't last," Kelly said.

"Just around the corner was a Champions League final, won that, and now a Euros final, won that."

Kelly has had to settle for a place on the bench in Switzerland, but every time she has come on she has made a difference for England.

Against Sweden, she provided the assist to kickstart a comeback before scoring in the shootout.

In the semi-final victory over Italy, it was Kelly's goal that sealed England's place in the final with just one minute of extra time to spare.

"Thank you to everyone who wrote me off - I'm grateful," Kelly said in a media conference after the final.

Speaking about Wiegman, Kelly added: "She gave me hope when I probably didn't have any. She gave me an opportunity to represent my country again."

Relive the penalty shootout that saw England win Euro 2025

Hampton, who has been playing her first major tournament as England's first-choice goalkeeper, had big shoes to fill in Switzerland.

Earps - twice named as the best women's goalkeeper in the world - had played significant roles in England's victory at Euro 2022 and on the way to the 2023 World Cup final.

But Hampton, who looked likely to start at the Euros even before Earps' retirement, has proved she deserves the number one shirt.

"At the start of the tournament did you think Hannah Hampton would be the star? Perhaps not. You wondered how she was going to do," ex-Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha said.

"Look how well she has done on the biggest stage. To save those penalties - and these were really good saves. She backed herself 100%.

"An amazing moment to see her be that important to the team."

Just months after England's Euro triumph in 2022, Hampton was dropped from the squad.

Reports suggested it was because of her behaviour, and she had to wait until March 2023 for a recall, when Wiegman said Hampton had "sorted out personal issues".

Speaking to BBC One following her shootout heroics in the 2025 final, Hampton said: "All I can really say is thank you to Sarina [Wiegman] for all the belief and faith that she's had in me.

"She knew what I was capable of and she really put that in me to really go and showcase what I can do."

Hampton, who helped Chelsea win a domestic treble this season, has shown exactly what she is capable of throughout the tournament.

After losing their opening game against France, Hampton was instrumental in helping England bounce back against the Netherlands - with a sublime defence-splitting pass starting the attack for England's first goal and setting the tempo for a statement 4-0 performance.

Then, in their quarter-final against Sweden, she pulled off two brilliant saves in the shootout to help keep England's title defence alive.

"The girls have run around for 120 minutes, so the least I can do is save a couple of pens here and there and help the team out in any way I can," Hampton told BBC Radio 5 Live after the final.

She added on BBC One: "There's still a lot more to come from me. For my first major tournament, to win it is not too bad."

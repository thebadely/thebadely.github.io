Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kelechi Iheanacho spent a year with Sevilla

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says Kelechi Iheanacho "will make a big contribution" after beating the Europa League signing deadline to secure the Nigeria striker as a free agent.

The 28-year-old Nigeria international's arrival on a one-year contract comes 24 hours after he came to an agreement with Sevilla to terminate his deal with the Spanish club.

It also comes after Celtic came under fire from their supporters for their failure to sign a striker on transfer deadline day.

Rodgers has turned to someone he managed during the striker's seven-year spell with Leicester City.

"He is such a talented player, with great ability, athleticism and work-rate," he told Celtic's website.

"He has great experience and he is right in his peak years, so he can be a great signing for us. I am sure he will make a big contribution to the team."

Rodgers had said last week that Adam Idah would not be allowed to leave without a replacement being signed.

When the Irishman was sold to Swansea City on deadline day without Celtic finding one, the Affiliation of Celtic Supporters Clubs was among those expressing its outrage, calling on chief executive Michael Nicholson to explain the "failure to strengthen the squad" and "the disarray witnessed on the final evening of the transfer window".

However, Rodgers insisted Iheanacho "will love being at Celtic and I believe our fans will love what he brings".

Iheanacho, capped 59 times, started his senior career with Manchester City, picking up a League Cup winner's medal during his time at the Etihad.

He then joined Leicester City, was an FA Cup winner in 2021 and helped his country to a second-place finish at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.

Iheanacho moved to Sevilla last summer before spending the end of season on loan with English Championship side Middlesbrough.

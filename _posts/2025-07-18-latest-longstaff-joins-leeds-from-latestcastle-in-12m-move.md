Here’s what you need to know: Longstaff is Leeds' fifth signing of the summer

Newly promoted Leeds United have signed midfielder Sean Longstaff from Newcastle for Â£12m plus potential add-ons.

The 27-year-old, who had one year left on his contract at St James' Park, has signed a four-year deal.

The move ends an 18-year association with Newcastle, having come through the ranks at the club.

"I think from the first time I spoke to Leeds, I got a feeling that they really wanted me," Longstaff told LUTV.

"It just fills you full of confidence and it just makes you want to repay those people. It is a massive, massive football club - similar to Newcastle in a lot of ways.

"It was going to take a lot for me to leave Newcastle to be honest and I wasn't just going to leave to go anywhere so it had to be the right place for me and my family and I think this is a perfect place.

"Every time I came to play at Leeds the atmosphere was amazing, it was always bouncing and a really tough place to play, and [I'm] just looking forward to having that on my side rather than having to play against."

He made 214 senior appearances for the Magpies, but played only 787 minutes for Eddie Howe's side in the Premier League last season - mostly as a substitute.

Longstaff also made five appearances in the Carabao Cup last season, but was an unused substitute as Newcastle defeated Liverpool 2-1 in the final to win their domestic trophy in 70 years.

Leeds had already agreed personal terms with the English midfielder but had an offer of Â£10m rejected by Newcastle earlier this week.

Longstaff is Leeds' fifth signing this summer following the arrivals of defenders Sebastiaan Bornauw, Jaka Bijol and Gabriel Gudmundsson as well as German forward Lukas Nmecha.

Daniel Farke's side will begin their Premier League campaign at home to Everton on 18 August.

They play Manchester United in a pre-season friendly in Stockholm on Saturday, before further friendlies against Villarreal and AC Milan in August. 

North Shields-born Longstaff joined the Magpies aged nine and made his debut for them in 2018, having initially gained experience on loan at Kilmarnock and Blackpool. 

His form during his first Premier League season meant he briefly became a transfer target for Manchester United but the Red Devils baulked at the reported Â£50m asking price.

Longstaff scored 16 goals for Newcastle, including one in a memorable Champions League win against Paris St-Germain in 2023.

He was a regular starter in both 2022-23 and 2023-24 but lost his place last season. 

With Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton firmly established as the midfield three, Longstaff only began eight Premier League matches - none of which came after Christmas.

A move to Elland Road should give the 27-year-old the chance to play more regularly and will also see him follow in the footsteps of his uncle Alan Thompson, the former Bolton, Aston Villa and Celtic midfielder, who also had a stint with Leeds towards the end of his career.

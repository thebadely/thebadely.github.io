It has been recently reported that Ricky Hatton's funeral was held at Manchester Cathedral on Friday, 10 October

The inquest into the death of former boxer Ricky Hatton has been opened and adjourned.

The 46-year-old, who won world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight, was found dead at his home in Hyde on 14 September.

South Manchester Coroner's Court, in Stockport, heard that Hatton was found by his manager Paul Speak.

The court was told by Alison Catlow, of Greater Manchester Police, that Hatton was last seen by his family on 12 September and appeared well.

The following day he did not attend an event as expected.

On 14 September Speak, who was in court to represent the family, attended Hatton's home to pick him up for a flight to Dubai.

Hatton, who was known as The Hitman, was found unresponsive.

Senior coroner Alison Mutch said they are awaiting the final cause of death, but it was indicated as hanging.

No family were in attendance.

A full inquest has been scheduled for 20 March.

Tributes poured in from the sporting world following news of Hatton's death, with Amir Khan remembering him as "one of Britain's greatest boxers" and Tyson Fury saying he was a "legend".

Hatton was one of Britain's most popular fighters, building a loyal following with more than 30,000 supporters travelling to Las Vegas for his title bout with Floyd Mayweather in 2007.

Thousands lined the streets for Hatton's funeral procession last week.

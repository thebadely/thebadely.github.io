According to new developments, Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon has been named as the winner of the Brits Critics' Choice Award. 

The Fife-born musician saw off competition from soul singer Sienna Spiro and east London artist Rose Gray, known for her infectious dance-pop, to claim the title. 

Formerly named Brits Rising Star, the award showcases up-and-coming talent selected by a panel of industry experts.

A shocked Jacob described the win as "bonkers" as the news was announced on BBC Radio 1's New Music Show.

Jacob joins previous winners including Adele, Sam Fender and The Last Dinner Party.

The musician, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, said they didn't think they were "Brits material" but were "really glad" the critics believed they were.

Jacob built a reputation in Edinburgh's folk scene after a difficult stint at university and a turbulent period in London.

The storytelling quality of the genre influenced debut album In Limerence, which discusses failed romantic relationships.

Jacob thanked those who had recognised their work, saying: "When I started making this album, when I write songs, it's so far away from any of this stuff and I never would have expected it to get this far. 

"It feels like I'm getting away with something that I shouldn't be getting away with. 

"So thanks for making me feel cheeky and very, very proud."

The musician said their family were "buzzing" when they were nominated, but feels their mum would have been "just as proud" if it had been a school assembly award. 

Jacob discovered a love of performing from a young age at a school talent show, but initially studied theoretical physics and medicine at Edinburgh University.

After spending nights cramming for exams in the library and realising academia wasn't the world for them, Jacob eventually dropped out.

As many have done in the past, Jacob moved to London to pursue music, but it was after returning to Scotland that things clicked into place. 

Jacob gained wider recognition following a November 2024 appearance on Jools Holland's BBC 2 show, which was booked after the singer had released only one single, Fairy in a Bottle.

The song, performed on the programme barefoot, in a pair of golden-feathered trousers and a red shawl, was followed by a debut album last May.

It secured a place on the Mercury Prize shortlist, and Jacob also became the first Scottish act to be named BBC Introducing Artist of the Year.

The Brit award, in partnership with BBC Radio 1, has reverted to its original name this year to acknowledge the importance of critical acclaim for artists in the early stages of their career.

The Brit Awards will be broadcast live from Manchester's Co-op Live on Saturday 28 February.

According to new developments, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing a revolt from his MPs after the U-turn on workers being able to claim unfair dismissal from day one, according to The Times. It quotes an unnamed minister describing the climbdown as "total-self destruction" and Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, calling the Employment Rights Bill a "shell of its former self".  The Daily Telegraph's headline states that "Starmer rips up Rayner's rights bill" and calls it a "second manifesto breach in as many days". But the Guardian notes that the TUC is prepared to accept the compromise as it wants to get other rights, like day-one sick pay, onto the statute books.

The Daily Telegraph claims young workers are fleeing "Labour's high tax Britain" with under-35s leading a "near record exodus". The paper reports on ONS figures which suggest that those aged between 16 to 34 make up two thirds of departing Britons. Leading with the story, the Daily Mail calls the number of young people leaving the UK a "brain drain", which threatens to add to the pain of what it describes as a "disastrous Budget" by Rachel Reeves. 

The Daily Express highlights the latest stage of the Assisted Dying Bill which is to be debated by the House of Lords early next year. The paper quotes campaigners criticising opponents for tabling dozens of amendments which could cause delays and accusing peers of "stealing precious time and choice" from those who are terminally ill.

The Daily Mirror claims to have an exclusive on the 1999 unsolved fatal shooting of the BBC presenter Jill Dando.  With the headline "tied to murder", the paper alleges a newly unearthed photo of a Serbian assassin is being assessed by detectives as he appears to be wearing a similar tie to a man caught on CCTV near the crime scene.

Archaeologists believe a circle of pits near Stonehenge were created by Neolithic people who were interested in the underworld, reports the Guardian. The 20 pits, which are spread about a mile across, were first revealed in 2020 but the paper says new research has concluded they were made by humans rather than being natural features as some had previously thought.

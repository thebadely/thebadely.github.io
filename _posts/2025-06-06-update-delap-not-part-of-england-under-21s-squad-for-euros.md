Here’s what you need to know: Liam Delap has not been included in the England Under-21s squad for this month's European Championship in Slovakia.

The 22-year-old has just completed a Â£30m move from Ipswich to Chelsea and is expected to travel to the United States with his new club for the Club World Cup.

Despite not being able to select the striker for his squad, England Under-21s head coach Lee Carsley said he was "delighted" for Delap.

"It's a brilliant thing for an English centre-forward to play in the Premier League at such a prestigious club like Chelsea. Hopefully, he'll do really well there and push for the [England] senior team," he added.

Sunderland's Jobe Bellingham is in the squad, despite interest in the midfielder from German club Borussia Dortmund, who will also take part in the Club World Cup which runs from 14 June to 13 July.

On Bellingham, Carsley added: "Jobe is an important part of our squad and will be travelling with us. We just have to make sure that we're flexible."

Dortmund would have to complete the signing of Bellingham before the current transfer window closes on 10 June in order for the 19-year-old to be available for the tournament. The transfer window then reopens on 16 June.

The U21 Euros will take place across eight host cities in Slovakia from 11-28 June.

Liverpool's Premier League winners Jarell Quansah and Harvey Elliott are both in the squad, with Manchester City's James McAtee and Newcastle's Tino Livramento also included.

England are looking to defend the title they won in 2023, when the tournament was held in Georgia.

Elliott and Toulouse defender Charlie Cresswell are the only two players from that squad who are in this year's set-up.

West Brom's Tom Fellows will also travel with the squad as an additional training player.

England will kick-off their campaign against the Czech Republic on Thursday 12 June (20:00 BST).

Three days later they will face Slovenia (17:00), before their final group-stage match against Germany on Wednesday, 18 June (20:00).

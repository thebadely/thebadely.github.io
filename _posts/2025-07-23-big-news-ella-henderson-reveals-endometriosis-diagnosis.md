Experts revealed that Pop star Ella Henderson has revealed she has endometriosis and has partnered with a charity to raise awareness of the condition.

In a video message on her Instagram account, the multi-platinum selling artist said the last few years had been "a little bit of a rollercoaster" because of her symptoms but she had finally been diagnosed in January.

"I've really been struggling, not only with stomach bloating, physical pain but also  with my mental health on the basis that I thought at one point this was all just in my head," she said.

The 29-year-old, from Tetney in Lincolnshire, said she wanted to share her experience to start "an open conversation" about the condition.

Endometriosis causes cells similar to those in the lining of the womb to grow in other parts of the body, leading to severe pain.

It affects one in ten women in the UK and takes an average of almost nine years to get a diagnosis, according to Endometriosis UK.

Henderson said although her own diagnosis had been "devastating", it had also been "empowering" and she had partnered with the charity to raise awareness.

In her video message, she said she was determined to educate herself and get people talking about the condition.

"I don't want future generations of women to go through what I did. I know that my situation isn't unique and too many women unnecessarily suffer with undiagnosed endometriosis for far too long," she said.

Henderson, who rose to fame on ITV show The X Factor, said speaking to other women and learning to understand the condition had been "crucial".

"For me, I really struggled thinking this was just something I was going through," she said.

"I want you to know if you are going through this you are not alone."

Emma Cox, chief executive of Endometriosis UK, praised Henderson for sharing her experience in such "an open and frank way".

"Ella's willingness to share her story will no doubt help others in their diagnosis journey, helping them access the care they need," she said.

As well as raising awareness, the charity campaigns to improve education in schools and for healthcare practitioners to be trained to recognise the symptoms.

Ms Cox added: "Without education and awareness, those with the disease will continue to face challenges in getting a diagnosis and accessing the right care at the right time, as Ella did."

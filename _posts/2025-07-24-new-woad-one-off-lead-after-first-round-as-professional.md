Lottie Woad marked her professional debut by outscoring big names Nelly Korda and Minjee Lee to share second place on the opening day of the Women's Scottish Open at Dundonald Links.

The former amateur world number one from Surrey had held top spot on her own after six birdies in 14 holes, including almost holing her tee shot at the short 11th.

But her only bogey of the day at the par-four 17th dropped Woad back alongside Ireland's Leona Maguire - herself a former number one-ranked amateur - Japan's Rio Takeda and Spaniard Nuria Iturrioz, who all shot five under-par 67.

That was overtaken by England's Charlotte Laffar, who carded eight birdies and two bogeys to reach six under.

"I will definitely take it, there was some good and some bad, but overall it was pretty fair," Woad said.

"The last couple of holes were tricky with the wind and I was just playing for pars. It was pretty stress-free most of the day."

Woad, who won the Irish Open earlier this month, announced her decision to turn professional last week.

That came after missing out on Â£400,000 prize money when finishing just a shot outside the play-off won by Grace Kim at the Evian Championship, the women's fourth major of the year.

In a large group one shot behind on four under are world number one and two-time major champion Korda and Lee, who won her third major at last month's US PGA Championship.

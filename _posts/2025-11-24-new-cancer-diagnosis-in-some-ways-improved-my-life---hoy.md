'It's changed my outlook' - Hoy on cancer diagnosis

Sir Chris Hoy says his terminal cancer diagnosis has improved his life "in some ways" because it has changed his outlook.

The six-time Olympic cycling gold medallist announced in February 2024 that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.

In October 2024, the 49-year-old confirmed his diagnosis was terminal after the primary cancer spread to his bones, with doctors giving him between two and four years to live.

"It's changed my life without question, but I think in some ways it's improved my life," Hoy said.

"It's changed my outlook on a lot of things. I'm not as bothered by small things. I think I try and focus on the here and the now, enjoying the moment, making the most of today, and trying to find something positive in any situation. 

"And even at the very least, trying just to reject negativity, because it brings you down. If you can just, in any situation, look for the positives and surround yourself with people that are the same.

"I'm doing well. I'm able to keep doing all the things that I enjoy, spend a lot of time with my family, and I hope to be around for a lot longer yet."

Earlier this year, Hoy told Sky Sports that he had "entered a bit of a stability stage" in his treatment.

The Scot won his six Olympic golds - and one silver medal - between 2000 and 2012, making him Britain's second-most decorated Olympic athlete behind Sir Jason Kenny (seven golds).

He also claimed 11 World Championship golds and 34 World Cup titles before retiring in 2013.

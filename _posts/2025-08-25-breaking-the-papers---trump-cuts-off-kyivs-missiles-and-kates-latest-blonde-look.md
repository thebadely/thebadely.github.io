Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Several front pages carry news of the new memoir to be published this autumn by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the Duke of York and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse. The Daily Mail says the "bombshell" new book, which was completed before Giuffre took her own life in April, will contain "intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking details". The Daily Mirror reports Giuffre previously told the book's co-author, the journalist Amy Wallace, that she wanted to shed light on "systemic failures" that allowed vulnerable individuals to be trafficked across borders. The Sun's headline brands the book "Virginia's revenge". Prince Andrew has always denied Giuffre's allegations.

The Times has a poll that suggests nearly three-quarters of voters believe Sir Keir Starmer is mishandling the issue of asylum seekers being housed in hotels. The paper says its YouGov survey is a sign of growing public concern about what the "crisis". The Guardian highlights a number of politicians who have reported a sharp rise in the level of online harassment and death threats directed at them, with one MP calling it "worse than the Brexit years". According to the i Paper, ministers want migrants who arrive on small boats to be the first to have fast-tracked asylum hearings, but it will take months for a new law to become operational.

The Daily Telegraph says Ukraine is being prevented by the Trump administration from firing long-range US-made missiles into Russia, in order to draw Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Sunday that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had effectively been given final permission for any strike using the Atacms system. But the Telegraph says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky played down the restrictions, saying Ukraine had developed its own arsenal of long-range weapons and no longer needed to rely on American approval.

And the Daily Star is jubilant at the prospect of an August Bank Holiday Monday without any rain forecast on the UK mainland. The paper says Brits will "sizzle" in temperatures of up to 29C, making it "hotter than Morocco".

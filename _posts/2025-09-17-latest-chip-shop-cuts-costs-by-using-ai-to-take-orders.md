It has been recently reported that A chip shop manager said he has programmed an AI answering service to take orders in a bid to cut costs.

Brad-Lee Navruz, from The Nippy Chippy in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, said because of the rise in fish prices, the cost of living, and wage and National Insurance increases, he decided to utilise the technology.

It has saved him the cost of hiring someone specifically for the role, and Mr Navruz said he is the only person he knows of using the system in a fish and chip shop.

"We've been live about six months now and although it's been hit and miss, a lot of people love it," he said.

Mr Navruz said businesses can forget that customers get fed up with their local shops not answering and constantly being put on hold while trying to make their phone order.

"So it helps consumers as they can just call up and order [with the AI answer system], and come and collect it or get it delivered," he said.

"And fish and chips have gone through a world war and gone through Covid so I'm sure it will get through this cost of living crisis as well."

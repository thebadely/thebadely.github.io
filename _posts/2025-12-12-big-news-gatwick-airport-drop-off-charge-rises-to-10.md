According to new developments, Gatwick Airport is increasing the price of its drop-off zones by £3, bringing the minimum charge to £10.

The fee to allow drivers to stop outside the terminal for 10 minutes is to increase on 6 January. 

The airport said the increase was "not a decision we have taken lightly" and blamed "a number of increasing costs, including a more than doubling of our business rates".

Rod Dennis, RAC senior policy officer, said: "The words 'Happy New Year' are unlikely to be uttered by drivers dropping off friends and family at Gatwick in January."

He added: "A more than 40% increase in the cost to drop-off is the largest we've ever seen and represents a doubling of the fee since it first came in."

Southend Airport charges £7 for drop-off of up to five minutes, but that increases to  £15 for between five and thirty minutes. 

A drop-off fee of £5 was introduced at Gatwick in March 2021.

That increased to £6 in 2024, with the cost rising again to £7 in May. 

A Gatwick spokesperson said: "This increase in the drop-off charge is not a decision we have taken lightly, however, we are facing a number of increasing costs, including a more than doubling of our business rates.

"The increase in the drop-off charge will support wider efforts to encourage greater use of public transport, helping limit the number of cars and reduce congestion at the entrance to our terminals, alongside funding a number of sustainable transport initiatives."

They added that passengers can be dropped off without charge in long-stay car parks and catch a free shuttle bus to terminals.

Blue Badge holders remain exempt from the charge.

A government spokesperson said: "Airports are responsible for setting their own parking terms but must follow consumer law and justify their charges.

"We're delivering a £4.3bn support package to cap business rates bill increases at 30% before other reliefs for the largest properties, including airports.

"Without intervention those would be up to 500%."

Drop-off fees are also rising at Heathrow from 1 January from £6 to £7.

London City, the UK's last major airport without a drop-off fee, is to introduce one later this month.

Out of mainland Europe's biggest 10 airports, only one, Schiphol in Amsterdam, charges to drop-off, according to RAC research.

Let's dive into the details: Justin Jefferson has registered the most receiving yards in the NFL (7,758) since being drafted in 2020

After an epic weekend in Ireland, the NFL roadshow makes the short trip to England to continue this season's record run of international games.

Seven overseas matches will be played across five countries - three of them in London over the next three Sundays.

Dublin hosted its first regular-season game last Sunday, with the Pittsburgh Steelers holding on for a thrilling win over the Minnesota Vikings.

And the Vikings have hopped across the Irish Sea to become the first NFL team to play in two foreign countries in the same season.

They face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham on Sunday, a game which features two of the NFL's top 10 players, external - Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson and Browns defensive end Myles Garrett.

Another of the league's top 10 - Denver cornerback Patrick Surtain II - then comes to town, along with two of this season's dark horses for the Super Bowl and a rookie dubbed an NFL 'unicorn'.

Sunday, 5 October (14:30 BST): Cleveland Browns @ Minnesota Vikings â Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London

Sunday, 12 October (14:30): Denver Broncos @ New York Jets â Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London

Sunday, 19 October (14:30): Los Angeles Rams @ Jacksonville Jaguars â Wembley Stadium, London

The Vikings did well to threaten a late fightback against the Steelers given their offensive line has been decimated by injuries, leaving back-up quarterback Carson Wentz exposed.

Wentz will make his third start in place of injured starter JJ McCarthy and face one of the NFL's most fearsome defensive players in Myles Garrett, who has four sacks this season.

Minnesota reached last season's play-offs but come in with a 2-2 record, while Cleveland are 1-3 after Sunday's 34-10 defeat at Detroit.

The Browns selected Dillon Gabriel in the third round of this year's draft, while Shedeur Sanders - the initial favourite to be the first overall pick - made a dramatic slide to the fifth round.

That put the rookies into a four-way quarterback competition to be the Browns' starter this season. Veteran Joe Flacco earned the job while Kenny Pickett was traded and Gabriel named back-up, with Sanders third on the depth chart.

With Cleveland facing a tough start to the season, there was speculation coach Kevin Stefanski would make an early change at quarterback, and last week Sanders told ESPN: "If you see the quarterback right now, I know I'm capable of doing better than that."

That was just a few days after his father Deion - a two-time Super Bowl winner and his college coach at Colorado - told the Kelce brothers' New Heights podcast that Shedeur would start at some point this season.

Before flying to London, the Browns said Gabriel will start this Sunday, meaning Sanders has moved a step closer to playing his first snap in the NFL and earning an opportunity to prove his many doubters wrong.

Next up are the struggling New York Jets against the Denver Broncos, who have been mentioned as potential Super Bowl contenders.

Bo Nix was the sixth quarterback to be drafted last year, immediately becoming the Broncos' starter, and, but for a sensational season for Washington's Jayden Daniels, he might have won the Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

Nix showed the maturity and composure to lead coach Sean Payton's offence as Denver reached the play-offs for the first time since winning the Super Bowl in 2016.

And the 25-year-old is not afraid to let fly, as he showed in Monday's 28-3 win over Cincinnati, with new running back JK Dobbins doing the damage on the ground.

Dobbins has bolstered a balanced Denver offence while the Broncos boast the reigning Defensive Player of the Year, cornerback Surtain II, on the other side of the ball.

They are currently 2-2 and visit defending champions Philadelphia before facing a new-look Jets team hoping to move on from the Aaron Rodgers era.

They have a new general manager, new head coach and new quarterback, but so far little has improved after last season's 5-12 finish. Going into week five, the Jets are one of three teams yet to win a game.

But quarterback Justin Fields can produce explosive plays with his arm and legs, and a mid-season trip to London has often provided the springboard for a team to turn around their fortunes.

Wembley hosts the final London game, which will feature two teams who are currently 3-1.

Like Denver, the Los Angeles Rams are seen as dark horses this season as it is only three years since their last Super Bowl win and they still have plenty of star talent.

Only Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott has thrown for more passing yards than Rams veteran Matt Stafford (1,114), with Puka Nacua (503 yards) the NFL's leading receiver and Davante Adams having added 269 after joining from the Jets.

Having gone 4-13 last season, the Jacksonville Jaguars named Liam Coen as head coach and a 34-year-old James Gladstone as general manager, and they made a bold move in this year's draft by trading up to take Travis Hunter with the second overall pick.

Hunter plays on offence and defence and hopes to establish himself as the NFL's first genuine two-way player since the 1990s and a certain Deion Sanders, who was his college coach at Colorado.

Hunter, 22, has played more as a receiver than a cornerback, making 13 receptions for 118 yards, so is yet to have a breakout performance.

Under the Wembley arch, in the NFL's biggest international arena, would be the perfect stage to announce his arrival.

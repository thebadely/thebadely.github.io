According to new developments, Luke Littler is the world number two

World champion Luke Littler was denied entry to Wednesday's Players Championship 33 event after he arrived late because of traffic congestion caused by a serious incident.

The 18-year-old was set to play in the penultimate Players Championship event of 2025 at Wigan's Robin Park Leisure Centre.

But he had to withdraw after missing the 11:00 GMT registration deadline for players.

It later emerged someone had died in an incident on the M6.

Littler posted on Instagram: "Missed registration today for the pro tour, but someone sadly lost their life. Thinking of everyone."

Littler was replaced by fellow Englishman Charlie Manby, who is ranked 174th in the PDC's order of merit. He upset 2018 world champion Rob Cross 6-5, before being knocked out in the second round.

The event was won by England's Chris Dobey, who beat Ireland's William O'Connor 8-6 in the final to leapfrog Cross to eighth in the order of merit.

Littler can play in event 34, the final one of the year, at the same venue on Thursday.

The top 64 players in the Players Championship rankings qualify for the finals, which take place in Minehead, Somerset, from 21-23 November.

Littler, runner-up at the 2024 finals, claimed his first Players Championship event victory of 2025 at event 32 this month to secure his place at the finals.

Three-time world champion and world number three Michael van Gerwen will not feature at this week's events because of a family holiday.

As he is outside the top 64 in the Players Championship rankings, the Dutchman will miss the finals for the first time.

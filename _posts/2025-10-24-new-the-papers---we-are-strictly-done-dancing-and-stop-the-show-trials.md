According to new developments, The acquittal of the only soldier to be prosecuted for the murders on Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland in 1972 features prominently on several front pages.  The Times says the evidence against Soldier F fell "well short" of the evidence for conviction, arguing the verdict is expected to end decades of inquiries into the killings. With the headline, 'Stop the show trials for veterans', the Daily Telegraph quotes opponents of Labour's decision to scrap immunity for former soldiers. The Daily Mail claims the case was a "politically driven show trial pursued with excessive zeal". Downing Street said the verdict was an example of the complex legacy of the Troubles.

The Guardian reports that the chancellor is discussing an income tax rise in next month's Budget. Sources say she is considering adding 1 pence to the basic rate, which would break one of Labour's main manifesto pledges. But the paper claims Rachel Reeves is nervous about the political consequences of abandoning the election promise. The Treasury declined to comment.

Prince Andrew believes the King is trying to force him out of his 30 room home near Windsor so he can give the property to the Queen if she is widowed, according to the Daily Telegraph. It says reports of the King wanting his brother to move out of Royal Lodge predate the recent revelations about his links with Jeffrey Epstein, but the idea has been given fresh impetus by the disclosure he is not paying rent.  The paper says the King's aides have flatly denied the suggestion.

The Financial Times says China and India, the biggest customers of Russian oil, have slashed their imports after President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Moscow's supplies to try to force it to the negotiating table with Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin said the sanctions would not significantly hurt the Russian economy.

And the Sun reports that Strictly Come Dancing has been plunged into turmoil after the presenters, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkelman, stepped down as part of a "secret pact" the pair made a year ago. But BBC bosses have vowed the show must go on, with the paper naming Holly Willoughby and Fleur East among the stars tipped to replace the departing duo.

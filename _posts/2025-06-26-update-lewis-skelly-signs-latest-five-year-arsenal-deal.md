Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Myles Lewis-Skelly made his Arsenal debut in September

England defender Myles Lewis-Skelly says he wants to create a "legacy" at Arsenal after signing a new five-year contract with his boyhood club.

Lewis-Skelly broke into the first team last season and established himself as a regular under Mikel Arteta, making 39 appearances in all competitions.

The 18-year-old's previous deal was due to expire in 2026.

Arsenal finished second in the Premier League last season, 10 points behind Liverpool.

"I want to win everything there is to win in the game," Lewis-Skelly told the Arsenal website., external

"I want to win trophies on the biggest stages whilst being a person that's always learning and stays grounded, which is so important.

"I know I've taken a lot of experience from the games about the positive moments, the mistakes that I've made. I'm definitely more ready now for the next season. I just want to keep learning and keep improving."

Lewis-Skelly was shown two red cards in the league last season, although his sending-off against Wolves was overturned.

Eight days later he scored his first league goal during a 5-1 win against Manchester City, before mimicking Erling Haaland's meditation celebration.

In March Lewis-Skelly became the youngest player to score on their England debut, registering in a 2-0 win against Albania at Wembley.

He won a third cap during the 3-1 defeat by Senegal this month.

Lewis-Skelly was a central midfielder in Arsenal's academy but has excelled at left-back, with licence to step into midfield, since making his Premier League debut as a substitute against Manchester City in September.

"I've embodied the values of Hale End and come through," Lewis-Skelly said.  

"I've still got a lot of years ahead of me, so if I can keep staying humble and being a good person, that's the most important thing to me."

He was dribbled past only once in the Premier League, the best record of any player to have made at least 15 starts.

He also won the most duels (six) per 90 minutes and ranked third for fouls won (3.1).

Lewis-Skelly has a 93.6% pass accuracy, the fifth highest in the division among players who featured for at least 1,000 minutes last season.

He was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Season award.

Experts revealed that Heather Watson has not played a match since August 2025

Heather Watson has confirmed she will miss this month's Australian Open but says she is on course to return from injury by the end of February.

The 33-year-old has slipped to 269 in the world and ninth in the British rankings having been out since late August with a tendon issue in her glute - her first major injury in a 17-year professional career. 

She last played in the first round of qualifying for the US Open, having lost in the first round at Wimbledon on 1 July. 

Watson, who won the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 2016 and reached the women's doubles quarter-finals two years later, has recently resumed training.

In a post on Instagram from Florida, where she is taking part in winter training, Watson said she is looking forward to getting back to action.

"I've really missed my purpose, and the everyday challenge tennis gives me," she said.

"I cannot wait to be back on tour competing again. Hopefully if all goes to plan, at the end of February.

"Missing Australia this year has really hurt my heart, but also lit a fire inside me."

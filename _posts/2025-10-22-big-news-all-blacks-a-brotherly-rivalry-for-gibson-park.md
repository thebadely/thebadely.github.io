Let's dive into the details: Gibson-Park has played 43 times for Ireland 

Ireland scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park says facing New Zealand feels like a "brotherly rivalry".

Gibson-Park was born in New Zealand but qualified to represent Ireland in 2019 after three years with Leinster.

The 33-year-old has since played 43 times for Ireland and is looking forward to another meeting with the All Blacks in Chicago on 1 November.

"It's always one I want to be a part of, and I love coming up against those guys," he said.

"It dates back to my childhood. You guys are probably the same, the brotherly rivalry, it is a bit like that, I played against lots of these guys when I was younger, so I get that feel. 

"This one will be no different."

Gibson-Park says he can still recall his first game against his country of birth, when Ireland beat New Zealand 29-20 in November 2021.

"It was strange, I thought I was ready for it but when you get out there in the moment it hits you pretty hard," he added.

"Strange, but pretty awesome. It was pretty special to face the haka and have the anthems."

Following the international break, Gibson-Park will be joined at Leinster by All Blacks centre Rieko Ioane, who is taking a "sabbatical" from the Blues to join the Irish province on a seven-month contract.

Gibson-Park admitted news of Ioane's move surprised players at the province when it was announced in April.

It also shocked fans, given former Leinster great Johnny Sexton alleged that Ioane ignited a row between the pair by making comments after the final whistle of Ireland's 2023 World Cup exit to the All Blacks - the last game of Sexton's career.

"I trained with him with the Blues. I was 21 so I think he was still in school, he was that well thought of," recalled Gibson-Park. 

"Since then, I haven't had much to do with him, but I think like a lot of people we were shocked. 

"You normally get a bit of a whisper of something about to go down but this hit us point blank."

Gibson-Park is also excited to continue to work alongside former Ireland captain Sexton, who is part of Andy Farrell's backroom team having also assisted the Englishman during British and Irish Lions tour in the summer.

"He's an awesome person to have around camp. It's just different, not strange, I suppose he would have always been a big voice in the room and now it's different as a coach," he explained.

"It's different seeing him in that light but he is still Johnny and when he speaks, everyone listens. We're really lucky to have him around."

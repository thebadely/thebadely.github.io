Experts revealed that BBC Radio 1Xtra presenter Nick Bright is set to leave the station after 15 years on air.

Joining as part of its production team in 2009, Nick moved into presenting the early breakfast show a year later.

He's become a familiar voice to 1Xtra listeners, hosting weekend breakfast and a Saturday mid-morning programme over the years.

The station says his final show will be from 10am to 1pm on Saturday 3 January.

In a post on Instagram, 1Xtra thanked him for "15 fantastic years".

"He has brought great energy and enthusiasm," it added.

"He will always be a part of the 1Xtra family and we wish him the very best for the future."

Radio 1 Breakfast Show presenter Greg James was among colleagues paying tribute to Nick after his departure was announced.

"What a run," said Greg on Instagram, while 1Xtra Talks presenter Richie Brave called Nick "one of the greatest broadcasters out there".

The station says it will share its plan for Nick's replacement soon.

Outside of 1Xtra, the presenter is a familiar face and voice across BBC Sport and Radio 5 Live.

He has been part of covering cricket's The Hundred tournament and hosted programmes for Team GB during the Paris Olympics in 2024.

Fans may also have spotted him presenting live sport including Baller League, the Six Nations and Formula E.

Lions Top 10s: Dawson's controversial 2001 Lions tour diary

Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson was nearly sent home in disgrace from the 2001 British and Irish Lions' tour because of scathing comments he made about the squad's management.

Dawson wrote a tour diary for the Daily Telegraph while in Australia and, in an article published on the morning of the first Test, was highly critical of head coach Graham Henry, saying he did not inspire him and his regime was too strict.

"I was so far up my own backside and I really, really regret it as it was so unnecessary, thinking I was better than I was," he said. "It was petulant really."

Dawson recalls the full story on the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast, where he joined former Lion Jamie Roberts to discuss the British and Irish Lions' top 10 most controversial moments.

Dawson came on in the second Test after an injury to Rob Howley and started the final game - but the Lions lost both as the Wallabies fought back to win the series

"Deep, deep down I was peed off that I wasn't picked [to start the first Test]. I felt I was in form and had been England captain," said Dawson.

"From the off it was very obvious who the starting XV were going to be.

"There was no controversy or news on that tour so when my diary was printed everyone jumped on it.

"I was rooming with Austin Healey and he was told it had all kicked off back home so when he walked into our room, he said 'you are in so much trouble'.

"Literally as Austin has said that the phone rings and my mum's collapsed because she's had a panic attack from hearing the news as she knows that her son might be in the thick of it. 

"It's absolute chaos, so I went up to Graham Henry's room and knocked on his door and said we need to have a chat.

"The words he said to me were, 'it is unacceptable what you just did, but just to let you know, I know where you are coming from because I don't inspire myself at the moment' - and that was because one of the newspaper headlines was 'the coach doesn't inspire me'.

"They were his words. It was very open and honest of him."

Lions Top 10s: Controversies

Who is the most iconic British & Irish Lion of all time?

Lions captain Martin Johnson was influential in persuading team manager Donal Lenihan to let Dawson stay.

"I was feeling so bad and right in the thick of it, but it didn't affect the team who ploughed on and won," said Dawson.

"As soon as the game finished I was pulled over by the team manager and told I was going home as it was unacceptable.

"Martin then said 'no he is not' and said to the team manager that I shouldn't have done it but that is the reality of what has gone on.

"On the Monday they said I wasn't going home but they were going to fine me what I was paid for the article.

"They fined me Â£5,000, thinking that is what I was getting paid for it.

"They called a team meeting and put chairs around the whole room in a circle, with one chair in the middle.

"I stood up in the middle and Johnno [Martin Johnson] was keeping a straight face, but you have got all these other idiots killing themselves laughing.

"I was trying to be sincere but they were laughing. I said 'I am sorry for the unnecessary pressure before the first Test'.

"I was thankful we won."

Warren Gatland gave Brian O'Driscoll his Ireland debut

Roberts was also involved in a controversial Lions moment.

Former Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll played in the first two Tests against Australia in 2013, but was left out for the deciding match, causing shockwaves in the rugby world.

O'Driscoll, a Lions captain in 2005, was tipped by many to lead the team for the decider with Sam Warburton out injured.

Instead, Gatland opted to go for his Wales centre pairing of Roberts, who missed the first two Tests because of injury, and Jonathan Davies.

Roberts' injury meant Davies started the first two Tests at inside centre instead of outside centre, and his move into O'Driscoll's 13 shirt put him in the firing line.

"One thing I have massive respect for with Warren Gatland is that he wasn't one for sentimentality," Roberts recalled.

"That was Warren through and through. He shut out the outside noise and believed in what his ears heard and eyes saw.

"BOD [Brian O'Driscoll] by his own admission wasn't brilliant in that Test series. In 2009 he was brilliant and in 2013 he was playing well but not like in 2001 and 2009.

"I made myself fit and Warren, with the Test series in the balance, saw strength in picking a familiar Welsh spine.

"He saw past the sentiment and the need to satisfy the four countries and BOD's last Test as a Lions great.

"Jon [Davies] sat on the bus beside me and said 'I am going to take some stick here' and there was a Facebook page called 'Justice for BOD' with a million likes.

"Luckily for me Jon took all the flack."

Gatland's call came up trumps as a Lions side featuring 10 Welshmen in the starting XV thumped the Wallabies 41-16 to clinch the series, with Roberts scoring the final try.

O'Driscoll: No animosity to Gatland over Lions omission

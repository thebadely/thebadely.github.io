Experts revealed that Champion jockey Oisin Murphy has been fined £70,000 for drink driving after crashing his car into a tree. 

Murphy was arrested after his Mercedes A Class left the road in Hermitage, Berkshire, at about 00:05 BST on 27 April.

He pleaded guilty at Reading Magistrates' Court earlier to driving a motor vehicle while over the prescribed limit of alcohol.

The 29-year-old was charged by postal requisition on 19 June - the day he rode two winners at Royal Ascot.

He was not asked to plead on another count of failing to cooperate with a preliminary test at the roadside.

Murphy was also banned from driving for 20 months, and will have to reapply for his licence from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

His driving ban could be reduced by 20 weeks if he were to take part in a drink drive rehabilitation scheme by August 2026.

He was ordered to pay a £2,000 surcharge and £85 in court fees.

Murphy had a passenger with him at the time of the crash, who was the owner of the car, the court heard. They were both taken to hospital after the crash.

Murphy was later discharged to take a breathalyser test at a police station at about 07:00, that showed a reading of 66mg per 100 millilitres of breath - just under twice the legal limit.

Judge Sam Goozee, sentencing, told Murphy: "You are lucky that neither you, your passenger, or the public were injured by your actions.

"I do balance that with the remorse you have shown.

"You have also recognised that you have let the public down by virtue of your actions, and your colleagues in the racing world."

The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) said Murphy would remain free to continue riding, but new conditions would likely be added to his licence as a result of his conviction.

"His conduct fell a long way short of the standard we expect of all licensed individuals, in whom we place trust that they will represent our sport to the best of their abilities," a spokesperson said.

"This is a very serious offence that, in the course of being committed, saw Mr Murphy jeopardise not only his own safety but that of his passenger and all other people travelling on the roads at the same time as him that night."

They said they would issue an update on his licence "in due course".

Murphy, who grew up in Killarney, County Kerry, has been crowned UK champion jockey four times - in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2024.

He was among the winners at the Doncaster Racecourse Supporting Racing Staff Week Handicap last week.

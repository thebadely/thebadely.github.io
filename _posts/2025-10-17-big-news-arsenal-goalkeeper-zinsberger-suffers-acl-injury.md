Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Manuela Zinsberger was Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper before Daphne van Domselaar's arrival from Aston Villa in July 2024

Arsenal have confirmed goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger has suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.

The Austria international sustained the injury during a training session before the Gunners' 2-0 victory over Benfica in the Women's Champions League on Thursday.

Arsenal said Zinsberger "will undergo surgery in due course and is expected to be sidelined for the remainder of the 2025-26 season".

The 29-year-old, who joined Arsenal from Bayern Munich in 2019, has yet to feature for the club this season, with Daphne van Domselaar claiming the number one spot.

Zinsberger played a crucial role in her side's Women's Champions League triumph last season, making eight appearances in the competition.

"Manuela is being closely supported by our medical team at Sobha Realty Training Centre, and everyone at Arsenal looks forward to seeing her return to action as soon as possible," the club added in a statement.

What is an ACL injury and why is it so serious?

Zinsberger, who has 110 international caps, had been called up to Austria's squad for the double-header against the Czech Republic in the Uefa Women's Nations League play-offs later this month.

"I'm incredibly sorry for Manuela. With her absence, we're not only losing a top performer, but also a role model for many," said Austria head coach Alexander Schriebl.

"We'll offer her all the support we can on her way back and hope that her recovery process goes as smoothly as possible."

Austria have also lost Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger and Bayern Munich midfielder Sarah Zadrazil to ACL injuries in recent weeks.

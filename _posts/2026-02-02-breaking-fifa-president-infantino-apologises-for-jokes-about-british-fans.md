Let's dive into the details: Gianni Infantino succeeded Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in 2016

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has apologised for controversial comments he made about British football supporters which were criticised by fan groups.

At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last month, Infantino said it was "really special" no British nationals were arrested during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Amid concerns over the cost to attend matches at this summer's 2026 World Cup, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) responded by saying the Swiss-Italian should "concentrate on making cheap tickets" as opposed to "making cheap jokes about our fans".

In an interview with Sky News, external, Infantino said his comments were "meant to be more of a light-hearted remark" to highlight how the Qatar tournament "was a celebration" and "a peaceful event".

As he said sorry to fans from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the first instance, the 55-year-old said it was "not my intention" to cause offence to them.

Infantino added he was a "huge fan of English football" and had been wrong to say English people "just go and riot around the world" at football matches as fans, referring to them as "criminals" instead.

The head of world football's governing body also defended the decision to award US President Donald Trump the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize before the draw last December for the 2026 World Cup.

The award was to be given to a person who had "taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace" and "united people across the world".

Infantino acknowledged there had been a "strong reaction" to the decision, but said "objectively" Trump "deserves it" because he was "instrumental in resolving conflicts and saving lives and saving thousands of lives".

Infantino said Fifa will "definitely" consider lifting a ban on Russia even though the war in Ukraine was still ongoing.

Russian football clubs and national teams were suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa in February 2022 after the country's invasion of Ukraine.

"We have to, because this ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred," explained Infantino.

"Having girls and boys from Russia being able to play football games in other parts of Europe would help."

Infantino also said he was against calls to ban Israel from international competition and believes Fifa should discuss changing its statutes to prevent boycotts.

"We should actually never ban any country from playing football because of the acts of their political leaders," added Infantino, who became president of the organisation in 2016.

"Somebody needs to keep the ties open."

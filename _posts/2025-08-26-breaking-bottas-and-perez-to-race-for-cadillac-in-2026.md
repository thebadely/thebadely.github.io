Experts revealed that Valterri Bottas (left) helped Mercedes win the constructors' championship each year between 2017 and 2021, while Sergio Perez did the same for Red Bull in 2022 and 2023

Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez will race for the new Cadillac Formula 1 team next year.

The decision marks a return to the F1 grid for the two drivers, neither of whom is racing this year after being dropped at the end of 2024.

Mark Reuss, the president of Cadillac's parent company General Motors, said the decision was based on the drivers' experience of wins and podiums in F1.

He described the choice of Bottas and Perez as "a really good winning combination".

Bottas, who turns 36 on Thursday, won 10 races for Mercedes, for whom he drove as Lewis Hamilton's team-mate from 2017-21, also scoring 20 pole positions.

The Finn last raced in F1 for Sauber in 2024 and is Mercedes' reserve driver this season.

Perez, 35, has won six grands prix, five for Red Bull between 2021-24 and once for Racing Point - the team now known as Aston Martin - in 2020.

The Mexican was dropped by Red Bull at the end of last season despite having two further years on his contract after the team felt he had run out of time to prove he could provide the required support for Max Verstappen.

Dan Towriss, chief executive officer of GM's partner TWG Motorsports, said Cadillac had considered signing a young and up-and-coming driver before confirming this line-up.

"Their experience, leadership and technical acumen are what we need," Towriss said. "We're humbled by their belief in us and this project.

"There is a young pool of drivers who are exciting and very talented so it was a tough decision. But it was the leadership of these two drivers that stood out."

Bottas said: "The first talks we had was about two years ago. Early on it was clear to me that I wanted to be part of this great brand, this start-up team but with great structure and big goals. 

"Of course, we are realistic, it is a mountain of work to do, and it is F1. But we are not here to stay at the back and with this structure and group of people there is no reason why we shouldn't be able to get quickly to the pace. 

"Checo and I still have quite a bit in the tank so we will enjoy it when we get there."

Perez added: "I had a very difficult final year with Red Bull, it is a sport I love and I want to get back to enjoyment and this brings me the excitement back because I can put all my experience and try to help this team more forward. 

"We want to move forward as quickly as possible. We know we don't have time on our side. But we are bringing as much experience as possible, and we believe in the project that we can move quickly forwards."

Would Red Bull be interested in an Albon return?

Cadillac wants in the future to have an American driver but Towriss said proven experience and ability in F1 was a more important factor as the team works towards its debut season.

Team principal Graeme Lowdon said in June that Cadillac expect to be backmarkers in their debut season.

"Can you imagine if you've owned a Formula 1 team for 10 years and then another team rocks up and beats you? You would be apoplectic," Lowdon said.

"You would be so annoyed. And so you have to assume that any new team coming in is going to be last, you know, otherwise, you know, what's gone wrong somewhere else?"

Cadillac had been linked with Indycar drivers Colton Herta and Josef Newgarden, but Towriss pointed out that Herta had not scored enough points on the qualification scale of governing body the FIA to earn an F1 super-licence.

The team wanted drivers with a significant depth of knowledge in F1, and proven capabilities, to help them build up to competitiveness as quickly as possible.

Towriss added: "What it comes down to is experience in F1 that carried the day. Despite the experience on the team, everybody is new and working together for the first time.

"It is important to us to make sure there is a pathway for an American driver into F1 but for this inaugural season, this was the right combination."

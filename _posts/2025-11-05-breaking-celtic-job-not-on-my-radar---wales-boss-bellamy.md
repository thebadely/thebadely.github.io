'I couldn't want for anything more than what I have at this present moment'

Craig Bellamy "understands" why his name has been linked with the vacant managerial role at former club Celtic but is "fully committed" to Wales.

Brendan Rodgers resigned as Celtic boss last month and their list of potential replacements included their former forward Bellamy, who is contracted to Wales until 2028.

But Bellamy says he is focused on the upcoming World Cup qualifiers as Wales bid to reach next summer's finals.

"It's not on my radar - and it won't be on my radar," Bellamy said of the Celtic job.

Wales face Liechtenstein and North Macedonia in their final World Cup qualifying group games in November and two wins would guarantee runners-up spot in Group J.

As a player Bellamy, who was appointed Wales boss in July 2024, spent the second half of the 2004-05 season on loan at Celtic from Newcastle United.

"I can understand the links because I played there, [now] I'm coaching, so I definitely understand the links," the 46-year-old added.

"But to me, I love what I'm doing at this present moment. I have to be honest, I'm completely focused on what's to come.

"It looks it's going to be a play-off in March, we know that and to me, that's all I'm focused on and I know it's a little bit cliched, but it's the honest truth.

"I couldn't want for anything more than what I have at this present moment and that's where it lies with me."

The former Liverpool and Manchester City player has impressed in his first senior managerial role, leading Wales to promotion to the top tier of the Nations League and implementing an adventurous new style of play.

Bellamy is in the midst of the most testing spell of his tenure so far, with Wales losing three of their past four matches in all competitions.

"I have a number of years to run... I did sign a four-year contract," Bellamy added.

"Now, I know the game as well. Like, you lot might have had enough of me in a short space of time, that's reality as well.

"But I feel as long as I'm wanted, and people in Wales feel like I can add, then that to me is something that motivates me, then I stay.

"I try and live day by day you know, it's not always wise but to me it makes sense and in that I try and appreciate what I have.

"Having this at the moment has been one of the best periods of my life and hopefully that continues for a lot longer as well."

Experts revealed that A strike at Gatwick Airport which was expected to disrupt half-term travel has been called off, trade union Unite says.

Baggage handlers from Red Handling were due to walk out on Sunday and later this month in a pension dispute but will now suspend action pending a vote on new working terms.

Half-term flights could still be disrupted, however, with plane refuelers striking from today until Tuesday, and again from 23-27 May.

A Gatwick spokesperson said it was "pleased" baggage handling strikes had been called off while EasyJet, whose flights are likely to be most affected by the refuelling strikes, said it had contingency plans in place and expected to operate as planned.

Gatwick also added it was aware of the proposed industrial action from refeullers Redline Oil and was working "to minimise impact to passengers".

Airlines which were expected to be affected by the suspended baggage handling strike include Air Mauritius, Air Peace, Delta, Ethiopian Airlines, Norwegian, and TAP.

A spokesperson for Unite said it had received proof of payment of pension contributions from Red Handling. 

They said the union was suspending strike action on Sunday, as well as on Sunday 25 May, the day before a Bank Holiday and when most schools break for half-term.

Ben Davis, Unite regional officer, said: "Red Handling has returned to negotiations and made an improved offer and therefore Unite has suspended strike action to allow members to be balloted on the proposals."

Further strike action could still go ahead on 1 June pending the outcome of a further vote, the union added.

Red Handling and Redline Oil have been contacted for comment.

Experts revealed that Newport won the inaugural Super Rygbi Cymru title

The Welsh Rugby Union has vowed to close the gap from Super Rygbi Cymru (SRC) to the elite level, regardless of what happens with its radical proposal to cut two professional sides.

SRC is the top level of Wales-only competition, featuring 10 semi-professional club sides and was previously known as the Welsh Premiership.

The governing body officially starts a six-week consultation process on Monday after unveiling its plan to turn around the fortunes of the game.

The WRU's 'optimal system' would see the number of men's professional sides competing in Europe and the United Rugby Championship (URC) halved from the current four â Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets â to two.

Its document stated that such a scenario "would release significant investment" in the SRC, although it provides no detail on that statement.

The salary cap for playing staff in SRC, which gets under way on 12 September, has gone up to Â£160,000 after being Â£150,000 last season.

"At the moment we don't know what 'significant investment' could be but one thing that we are committed to is working with the 10 clubs individually and collectively to get their feedback, thoughts and ideas as part of the consultation process," said WRU head of player development John Alder.

"Whatever the future looks like, SRC has an integral role to play and we have to figure out how we can keep driving standards up.

"It will be an interesting six weeks and we will just have to wait to discover what comes from the conversations at all levels.

"We will ensure that the 10 SRC clubs are heard and they are part of the process because we are committed to continually improving the competition."

The SRC clubs are due to meet on 9 September and will discuss their approach to the WRU proposals, which could see a change to their relationships with regional academies.

"No club will ever turn their nose up at significant investment but we need to see what that means, and indeed if it's even there," said Jon Jones, chairman of Ebbw Vale and representative for the SRC clubs.

"We need a clearer picture of what the plans are and to get some detail, but we have a really good relationship with the Union and I am sure we will have those discussions."

The top level of the domestic game turned from the Premiership to SRC last season with Newport winning the title.

"We couldn't have asked for a better first season but we will look to keep pushing the dial on things," said Alder.

"There is an ambition to move the semi-pro game closer to the pro game and it was a good start in terms of style and intensity.

"There will be differences, and things like physical conditioning will always be tricky in a semi-pro environment, but we are determined to ensure there is a thriving, elite domestic platform for young and up and coming players.

"We want to help their development so they can grab URC chances with both hands when they come, but we also want to connect with really passionate communities in Wales with strong heritage clubs."

Newport kick off the season when they host Llandovery on Friday, 12 September.

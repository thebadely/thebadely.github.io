It has been recently reported that Childbirth charities are warning parents that hands-free breastfeeding or bottle feeding, when a baby is being carried in a sling, is unsafe.

The National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and the Lullaby Trust say the risks are highest for premature babies and those under four months old because their airways can be easily blocked.

Their updated guidance follows an inquest into the death of a six-week-old boy who was being breastfed in a baby carrier while his mother moved around their home.

A coroner's report to prevent future deaths like his found there was very little information on safe positioning of babies in slings or the risks of suffocation when feeding.

The baby, Jimmy Alderman, from London, was being breastfed in a sling in October 2023, but was in an unsafe position too far down the sling and lost consciousness after five minutes, the coroner found.

Attempts were made to resuscitate him straight away, but he died three days later.

Senior coroner for west London, Lydia Brown, issued a warning about the dangers of baby slings following an inquest held last year into his death.

She said there appeared to be no helpful visual images of "safe" versus "unsafe" postures for babies in slings or carriers, adding that "the NHS available literature provides no guidance or advice".

The NCT said it "immediately reviewed" its online information on baby slings and carriers after receiving the coroner's report and hearing feedback from Jimmy's parents.

The NCT's online advice now says: "Hands-free breastfeeding or bottle feeding, where the wearer moves around and does other jobs while the baby is feeding, is unsafe.

"This is especially true for babies under four months old. It also applies to babies born prematurely or those with a health condition."

The charity says young babies do not have strong necks and cannot lift their heads, meaning that their airway "can easily be blocked" in baby slings and carriers.

It adds that a sling's fabric or the fabric from a parent's clothes "could cause suffocation very quickly".

"If the sling or carrier is not correctly fitted and adjusted, babies can experience traumatic head injuries," the charity's advice says.

The NCT goes on to say that slings should be:

The Lullaby Trust said it had also changed its advice to parents. 

If your baby needs to feed, take them out of the sling, it now warns.

"We are constantly reviewing the evidence and research, as there is currently no robust evidence on how to feed hands-free safely, which is why we changed our guidance to advise against it," said CEO Jenny Ward.

The charity is helping to fund research to develop better guidance for parents and carers on the safety of baby slings and carriers.

The NHS website says when using a sling or carrier, do not let the material cover your baby's head.

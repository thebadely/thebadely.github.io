It has been recently reported that Reality TV star Molly-Mae Hague has said she won't be putting her engagement ring back on yet, despite getting back together with Tommy Fury.

The pair met on the 2019 series of Love Island, later becoming engaged, but last year shocked fans by announcing their split.

Earlier this year, Hague, 26, confirmed they were back together, but in her latest docuseries, she admits things are "not perfect" and that the pair still live apart.

The episodes, which dropped on Prime Video on Saturday, also cover issues such as her controversial remarks on a podcast in 2022, which she says led to her receiving "death threats".

On an episode of the Diary Of A CEO podcast, she said everyone had "the same 24 hours in a day" and appeared to suggest that if you want something enough, you can achieve it.

The remarks sparked a backlash on social media, with many accusing her of being "tone-deaf" as the comments didn't acknowledge her own privilege. 

Hague says she received "hateful comments" in her inbox as a result of the controversy.

But she added she had "accepted and realised" that what she said "was wrong".

Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury were arguably the most high-profile couple to have emerged from Love Island.

When the pair announced their break-up in August 2024, Fury immediately began facing accusations of cheating and getting another woman pregnant.

Fury, also 26, recently released his own BBC series, in which he denied those "disgusting" claims, but admitted that alcohol had "cost him his family".

Hague does not address the cheating claims in the latest series of Molly-Mae: Behind It All, but hints there are "trust issues" between the pair.

In the episodes, the influencer is seen juggling her busy work schedule with looking after the couple's two-year-old daughter, Bambi, at home in Manchester.

"It's glitz, it's glamour, it's fishing poos out the bathtub," Hague says of her daily routine.

Fury appears several times on video call, where he talks to his daughter and asks how her potty training is going.

"Bambi has always been really good for our relationship, and recently Bambi actually brought us closer together," Hague said, who added it was "the right decision" to get back with her ex.

But after one scene in which she is seen having a spat with Fury on the phone, she opens up about the challenges they still face.

"It's just this shadow of the past that will always just - it sounds really deep - but it will come back and haunt us," she said.

Speaking to a friend, Hague said there were still things that "trigger" her and that she's had panic attacks.

"I hear the word alcohol and I'm tense, I'm shaking, I'm really anxious," she said.

In another scene, she tells the cameras that while she and Fury have been spending more time together, things aren't back to how they were.

"I'm not putting my ring back on yet, just because I just don't feel quite ready. And also, I would like him to make a bit of a gesture. Not ask me again. That's a lot, but a nice dinner or something, just to have that moment of, 'OK, I'll wear my ring again'," she said.

"We're still figuring it out. We're back together, yes, but it's not perfect. It's a new chapter for me and Tommy."

Elsewhere in the series, Hague addresses the backlash she has faced online, including after that controversial podcast appearance.

In the episodes, Hague described the things sent to her inbox as "wild", saying: "To get so angry and to leave such hateful comments, send death threats, like, who's got that level of anger inside of them?"

But she added: "I was so disappointed in myself that I'd made that mistake," she said.

Hague also referred to the outrage sparked by a YouTube video, in which she claimed she had not "done one social fun thing" this summer, despite having posted about various holidays over the year.

"I can completely understand why people had a problem with what I said. The days where the nation's turned against you, they're not the best days," she says in the episodes.

"I get really frustrated with myself when I've said something that I think I could have worded better. I hate letting people down."

The new series, like the first, explores Hague's life behind the vlog camera.

It's a cross between a fly-on-the-wall reality show and a documentary series, in which cameras follow her around as she raises Bambi, while pursuing her various business ventures.

Hague, who has been open about her struggles with motherhood, says during the episodes she finds the balance of work and Bambi "quite hard to nail".

As well as her personal life, the episodes also look at her career as an influencer and founder of womenswear brand, Maebe.

For TV journalist Lauren Morris, the series is a "shrewd decision", as while she has to open up about her personal life, it also helps showcase her fashion business.

"I think it's brave of her to show us inside her life, when she doesn't have to," she said.

"Her critics won't change their minds about her, but then, it's her fans who will be watching this. Her critics won't - why would you bother."

The first series recently picked up a National Television Award, and Hague admitted the win "added to the pressure".

She was speaking at a Q&A event in London earlier this week, for which questions were submitted in advance by journalists. A moderator then asked a range of questions.

Hague said she was "really nervous" about people watching the second season of her series as she talks about things "I haven't spoken about before".

She added: "I just want everything that I put out to be... I want everyone to enjoy it and for it to be perfect."

Molly-Mae: Behind It All episodes 1-3 of Series 2 are available now on Prime Video. The latter three episodes will drop early 2026.

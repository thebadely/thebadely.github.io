According to new developments, The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail lead their coverage of Sir Keir Starmer's statement on the UK potentially recognising a Palestinian state with Israeli claims that this would be rewarding Hamas. 

The Guardian notes that as well as requiring Israel to hold to a ceasefire in Gaza, the statement also reiterates the UK government's demands for Hamas to immediately release all the hostages and commit to disarmament. 

But the Times points out that Sir Keir did not say these must be met before a Palestinian state is recognised. 

The i paper says the Board of Deputies of British Jews is seeking assurances that there will be no recognition without the release of the hostages - or if Hamas continues to reject calls for a ceasefire. 

But in its editorial, the Daily Mirror says: "This is not about Hamas. It is about acknowledging the right of the Palestinians to exist, to live with dignity and to be treated as equals at the negotiating table."

The Times describes the statement as "gesture diplomacy", saying that recognising Palestine as a sovereign state would do nothing to end starvation in Gaza. The Mail says Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Sir Keir of "political posturing at its very worst".

The Sun says that not for the first time, Sir Keir has buckled under pressure from his own backbenchers.

The Daily Express says the International Monetary Fund has urged the Bank of England to cut interest rates twice more this year, to help the UK's sluggish economy - as Britain reels from what it calls the tax raid by the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The Times puts a more positive spin on the IMF's report - highlighting the prediction that the UK will be the third fastest growing economy in the G7 this year - and next.

For a third day, the papers celebrate England's Euro-winning footballers. The i Paper says 65,000 fans joined the Lionesses for an unbelievable parade to honour their back-to-back victories. 

The Financial Times says "roaring fans" lauded the players as their bus made its way down the Mall. 

On the inside pages, the Mirror quotes the goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, as saying: "If you have a dream...believe it."

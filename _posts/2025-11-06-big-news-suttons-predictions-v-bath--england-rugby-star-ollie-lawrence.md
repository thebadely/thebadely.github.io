Here’s what you need to know: So much for the 'rise of the machines'.

BBC Sport's predictions expert Chris Sutton saw off the joint challenge of AI and the Football Manager 26 computer game to triumph last week - his first victory since the start of September.

This week, as well as AI, he takes on a human guest, but one who is a star in a different sport - Bath and England rugby player Ollie Lawrence, who supports Chelsea.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Lawrence, 26, returned from an Achilles injury in time to start the new Prem Rugby season and is in the England squad for the Autumn Internationals. England's next match is against Fiji at Twickenham on Saturday - kick-off is at 17:40 GMT and you can listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.

Lawrence also excelled at football and cricket as a boy, and was with the academies of Aston Villa and Birmingham City, as well as Worcester Warriors, before focusing on rugby at the age of 16.

Sutton is a keen cricketer himself, and has regularly turned out for Norwich cricket club in recent years, but says his rugby career did not really take off.

"I only played rugby once, for my school team," Sutton said. "We were really excited on the bus on the way there, but we lost 72-0 and I never played again.

"Anyway, it's great that Ollie played for Villa's academy, but I'd like to remind him I actually played for their first team."

Being compared to a rugby side is not usually seen as a compliment for football teams, but Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta revealed recently that he has been inspired by New Zealand rugby head coach Scott Robertson.

From playing both sports, Lawrence can understand why both coaches have shared ideas successfully.

"It definitely makes sense," he told BBC Sport. "There's lots to learn from both sports, for example in the way teams try to contain the opposition or set up for a counter-attack.

"I saw Paris St-Germain coach Luis Enrique was watching games from the stands recently, like we do in rugby, rather than the touchline. It is only a small thing but it can make a big difference because you see the game from a different perspective.

"Arteta has been using the rugby term 'finishers' rather than 'substitutes' too. I think the first time we started using that was with Eddie [former England coach Eddie Jones] who was massive on the bench having an impact on the game, and I can see why Arteta likes that mindset."

Lawrence was a constant presence at centre for Bath and England before his Achilles injury in March. It robbed him of any further involvement for Bath as they lifted a first league title in 27 years and also the chance to tour Australia with the British and Irish Lions.

Lawrence grew up in the midlands but became a Chelsea fan because of their kit.

"A lot of my best mates and my family support Villa, while my dad supports Wolves and my grandad was a West Brom fan - so I had a few different influences there," he explained.

"But when I was about five or six I went in a sports shop that had all the different shirts in there. I saw a blue one I liked so I picked that, and my dad said 'you know that's a Chelsea kit?' and I was like 'yeah - but I like it!'

"It was around 2004 or 2005, when Jose Mourinho was in charge, so it was pretty good timing to start supporting them. From then, I have stuck with them through the good times - and the not so good times too!"

Chris Sutton and Ollie Lawrence were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. 

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 12:30 GMT

It's hard to know how to view Tottenham at the moment, especially at home where they have been pretty underwhelming in the Premier League so far.

Spurs have taken only one point from their past four league games in their own stadium since beating Burnley on the opening weekend of the season, including last week's defeat by Chelsea when a couple of their players gave Thomas Frank the cold shoulder afterwards.

They did beat Copenhagen comfortably there in the Champions League on Tuesday, but it is still hard to make a case for them to overcome Manchester United because I am not really sure where their goals are going to come from.

Mind you, I am still not convinced by United either. There is no doubt they have shown strong signs of improvement but I still don't fully trust them to turn up, especially on the road.

Tottenham beat United four times last season, including in the Europa League final. This time? If I had to pick a winner I would actually back United, but I don't - so I am going for a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Ollie's prediction: Spurs will take this one. 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-2

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00

Everton were superb in the first half hour against Sunderland and, had Thierno Barry not ballooned his shot over the bar from close range at 1-0, they would have gone on to win that game.

Instead it was another reminder they are missing a top-class centre-forward. I feel sorry for Toffees boss David Moyes because Beto has also missed so many wonderful opportunities that his side have created this season.

Fulham's win over bottom side Wolves last week ended a run of four straight league defeats but it's hard to really gauge their form off that - it was only Wolves they beat.

That makes this a really tough game to predict. I don't think there are going to be loads of goals in it, and I can see it ending up in another draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Ollie's prediction: Everton have been playing quite well, but Fulham are a good team. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

London Stadium, 15:00

Which West Ham will turn up? 

If they rock up and play in the manner they did when they beat Newcastle here last week then there is only one winner, but will we see Nuno Espirito Santo's side play with that same intensity? 

I thought Freddie Potts did well on his first senior start against the Magpies, Lucas Paqueta was at his mercurial best and Jarrod Bowen impressed me with his strong running.

But the problem here is that this is exactly the kind of game where you expect West Ham to win, and they will mess it up.

Burnley are awkward opponents and they have got a bit about them. They are nothing like the open and expansive side under Vincent Kompany a few years back.

There was a softness about that Clarets side, which simply isn't there any more.

So, West Ham are going to have to work hard to win this and maybe Callum Wilson holds the key.

He was a nuisance for the Hammers last time out. It meant Bowen did not have to carry the team, and Wilson could make the difference this time too.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Ollie's prediction: West Ham to edge it. 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Stadium of Light, 17:30

Sunderland improved a lot as their game went on against Everton, but they got a real good going-over in the early stages.

They cannot afford to start like that against Arsenal, who have superior players and are such a threat from set-pieces too.

The Gunners don't have to play well to win, they just grind away until they find a way through.

Mikel Arteta's side weren't pretty when they beat Slavia Prague in the Champions League but they don't care, and why should they?

Some of the football they play might get people asking whether that is the way you'd want to win a title, but do you think the Arsenal players will be bothered when they are popping open the champagne?

It is about knowing how to do it, not how you do it. 

There is a lot of the old '1-0 to the Arsenal' in this current Gunners team, although I do expect them to take more goals off other teams at times.

It is at the back where they are so strong. 

Can Sunderland cause them problems? Absolutely, but I think this latest Arsenal win will come off the back of another Arsenal clean sheet.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Ollie's prediction: This should be quite comfortable for Arsenal. 0-3

AI's prediction: 0-3

Stamford Bridge, 20:00

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said after Wednesday's draw with Qarabag that he is rotating his team so much because the Club World Cup is taking its toll on his squad.

That must be a factor in their inconsistency, but I don't think it will matter here because Wolves have been such a rabble recently.

He has gone now but after last weekend's 3-0 defeat by Fulham, their former boss Vitor Pereira said that technically, tactically and physically they were not at the required level, and I don't expect anything to change at Stamford Bridge.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Ollie on Chelsea's prospects: Hopefully we are making a turn for the better now. We just need to be a bit more consistent, so having a few defenders stay fit would be great and getting Cole Palmer back from injury would definitely help too.

Ollie's prediction: I'd back us to win this, it is just whether we can keep a clean sheet. It's either 3-1 or 3-0 so I am going to be confident and say we will keep them out. 3-0

AI's prediction: 3-1

Villa Park, 14:00

Aston Villa were on a really good run until they lost at Liverpool last weekend, and they were quite unlucky at Anfield too.

Even so, I find it very difficult to write Bournemouth off in games like this. They can cause any team problems and I always feel like they will score.

I admire Villa boss Unai Emery for sticking to his guns tactically. He has his principles and even with people talking about teams having success by going direct this season, he hasn't changed his approach.

That might have given Liverpool a bit of encouragement, however, and it may give Bournemouth some encouragement too.

Playing in the Europa League on Thursday won't help Villa either, and that toll of games could catch up with them at some point.

The Cherries rescued a point with a 96th-minute goal in this fixture last season and I have a feeling it will end up all square this time too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Ollie's prediction: Bournemouth are going to score because Antoine Semenyo is on fire, but I am going with Villa to win. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-0

Gtech Community Stadium, 14:00

I didn't recognise Newcastle when I watched them lose at West Ham last weekend.

They were better when they beat Athletic Club at St James' Park in the Champions League in midweek, but their away form - or lack of it - must be a concern for boss Eddie Howe.

They are still solid defensively most of the time but scoring goals seems a particular problem for them when they are on the road. I can see why from watching that West Ham game because they just did not work the goalkeeper enough.

The way Brentford play under Keith Andrews, he is happy to set them up to play on the counter-attack even when they are at home, and I can see Newcastle struggling to break them down too.

I know I have gone for a few draws already this week, but this game smells of another one to me.

Sutton's prediction: 0-0

Ollie's prediction: This will end up in a draw. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-3

Selhurst Park, 14:00

The M23 derby is one of my favourite games.

Crystal Palace won it home and away last season but it's so hard to call this time.

The two teams are next to each other in mid-table, with Palace ninth, one place above Brighton.

Both teams won comfortably last week too, but Palace have got the Uefa Conference League on Thursday and that is going to affect them.

Without Europe, I probably would have gone for the Eagles to win but the more I think about it, the more I think the Seagulls will get something.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Ollie's prediction: I am backing Brighton to nick this. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

City Ground, 14:00

This is a big game for both teams because they could both really do with a positive result going into the international break.

Nottingham Forest nearly got over the line against Manchester United last week and they had a bit of spirit about the way they played, but Sean Dyche is still waiting for his first Premier League win with them and he will want to get that monkey off his back.

Leeds have done pretty well at Elland Road but, so far, the only time they have picked up any points or even scored a goal away from home was when they beat bottom side Wolves in September.

Their fragility on the road means this is a great opportunity for Forest, even though they play away in Europe on Thursday.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Ollie's prediction: Neither side is doing too well at the moment but I feel like Forest's luck has to turn after last season. 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Etihad Stadium, 16:30

Did Liverpool turn a corner with their great win over Real Madrid in midweek? Maybe, but this will show us where they are really at.

I feel like a lot of the time these two teams have cancelled each other out when they have met in recent years, but this time it feels like a game they both have to try to win - and it is City I am backing to come out on top.

The big call for all Fantasy Premier League managers is whether to triple-captain Erling Haaland. I am not going to do that, but I do think he will score - seriously, how can you go into any game at the moment and think he won't?

Whoever wins this, I feel like both teams are fighting for second place anyway, because I don't see anyone catching Arsenal now.

People sometimes get angry when I say things like that but I do think they will win the title from here and I have changed my prediction from before the season started, when I went for Liverpool. 

I don't often do that so early, but I don't think Liverpool can win it any more - we've already seen in the first 10 games how, defensively, they are too vulnerable, and then you look at how good Arsenal are at the back.

It is a similar story with City. I feel they will need Rodri at his very best to push the Gunners, but his injury problems don't appear to be over.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Ollie's prediction: I can see this being a game where City go 2-0 up, Liverpool get back into it and then City score another one at the end. 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-2

Chris was trailing the collective efforts of the BBC readers until the final two matches of week nine, but then got two exact scores from Manchester City's 3-1 win over Bournemouth and Everton's 1-1 draw at Sunderland.

That meant Chris ended up with eight correct results from 10 matches, including those two exact scores, for a total of 140 points.

He edged out the BBC readers, who got seven correct results with two exact scores, for a total of 130 points.

AI, who won outright for the first time in week eight, did not come close to a repeat triumph. It got six correct results with one exact score, giving it 90 points.

Chris' guests, the computer game Football Manager 26 and Miles Jacobson, the studio director of the company behind it, finished further back.

FM26 got four correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 40 points, while Miles got four correct results with one exact score, giving him 70 points. That meant they ended up with an average score of 55 points that counts towards the guests' total in the table below.

According to new developments, On his Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon Oliver Tarvet beat Switzerland's Leandro Riedi in front of a supportive home crowd 

If you're just hearing about the British underdog who has caught Wimbledon's imagination, then there's one thing he would like you to know - he's Ollie, not Oliver, Tarvet.

"I usually only get called Oliver when my mum is annoyed at me. So you know, I try to avoid it at all costs," the 21-year-old said.

He added that when he heard "Oliver" being shouted from the stands of court four during his first-round victory on Monday, it made him think he had "done something wrong".

The fans could be forgiven for not knowing - after all, he is the world number 733 making his Grand Slam debut.

But he is quickly carving a name for himself and is unfazed by what lies ahead in the second round - namely, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court on Wednesday in front of 15,000 fans. 

Should the US college student win, it would mark the biggest upset in Wimbledon history. But he is not ruling out his chances, choosing to see it as an opportunity not an experience.

"I don't really like the word 'experience' because I feel like then you're just there to almost just spectate; you don't really have the expectation to win," he told BBC Sport.

"And, obviously, I'm not saying that I expect to win. But at the same time I feel like I've been quietly confident this whole tournament and it's got me to where I am.

"A big thing for me is just playing the ball, not the player." 

For his father Garry, it is a moment he can scarcely believe.

"What a mouth-watering prospect," he said.

"A week of qualifying, a round one win. And this is just too much. It is going to be fun because Ollie has played in front of big crowds - 700 or 800, maybe 1,000. To go in front of 15,000, that is quite a step up, isn't it?"

Tennis was not an obvious career choice when Tarvet was young. His mother Jennifer is a teacher and his father is a construction manager.

But their family home in St Albans was very close to Batchwood Tennis Centre, where he played "five times a week".

Tarvet had his first proper tennis lesson when he was six. His memory of that day is a little hazy, but for his first coach, Ben Wood, it is as if it were yesterday.

"I can just remember thinking 'this kid is incredible' - I couldn't believe it. I've always stood by this - it was the best first impression anyone ever gave me in a first lesson.

"I kept making the challenge harder and he kept coming up with it. This is like a six-year-old who shouldn't be able to do those things, so I was blown away, straight away."

A talented footballer and cricketer, Tarvet's focus fully switched to tennis when he was a teenager. He was home-schooled for his A-Levels so he could play full-time at the Unique Tennis Academy in London.

He cites the programme as "a big stepping stone" in his development.

"I have a lot of appreciation and gratitude for what those guys did for me," said Tarvet.

"I wasn't on anyone's radar as a teenager, but they took me in and saw me as one of their own."

The improvements he made enabled Tarvet to start seriously thinking about moving towards a professional playing career.

Tarvet usually plays in front of small but boisterous US college crowds

Rather than going straight into the ATP Tour ranks, Tarvet decided the best option was to learn his craft in American college tennis.

Tarvet is studying for a communications and marketing degree at the University of San Diego and said he "owes a lot" to his coaches and team-mates there.

He is the latest British player to try the American college system, with others including Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley.

But why has it become a popular route?

"I think players are maturing a bit later," said Mark Hilton, LTA men's national coach. 

"Careers are lasting longer. And also the competition over there is great. Not many players are ready to play pro tennis at 18 and go to places where not many people watch, and it's financially very difficult as well.

"So if you can mature and go through that process of three to four years of being in a great programme, good coaches, playing within a team, getting an education - they often come out more mature."

'I can win against anyone' - British qualifier Tarvet to face Alcaraz 

'I deserve it' - GB qualifier wants prize money change

Time overseas has been fruitful in developing Tarvet's winning mentality. 

He earned victories in 23 of 25 matches this year, ranking him inside the top five singles players in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships.

On the professional circuit, Tarvet has won five titles on the ITF Tour - the third tier below the ATP and Challenger Tours - including one this year in San Diego.

But NCAA rules mean players are restricted in how much they can claim from professional tournaments.

Tarvet's run through qualifying to the second round means he should be taking home prize money of Â£99,000, which would increase to Â£152,000 if he beats Alcaraz.

However, he is only allowed to claim $10,000 (Â£7,290) in profit every year, as well as any expenses incurred during the events.

Tarvet describes himself as "fiery" on the court and he has showed over the past week he is not afraid to express himself.

During qualifying week his shouts of "Gareth!" after winning points were a particular source of amusement - and intrigue.

A giggling Tarvet would not divulge the full meaning, but hinted it was a reference to former Wales footballer Gareth Bale.

"My team-mates were laughing and they were blowing up our group chat because I was saying it," said Tarvet, who supports Liverpool.

"But [people are] going to have to wonder, I'm sorry. My team-mates were already annoyed at me for how much information I gave out.

"It's just the inside joke to keep guys accountable of their decision-making, that's all I'm going to say."

It has been recently reported that The Co-op has said the cyber attack it suffered earlier this year cost it at least £206m in lost revenues.

The retailer's IT networks were infiltrated by hackers in April, resulted in payment problems, widespread shortages of goods in shops, and the loss of customer data.

Co-op chair Debbie White said the "malicious" attack had caused "significant challenges" in the first half of 2025.

She added the group must now rebuild "better and stronger to meet the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead".

Let's dive into the details: Urand made his Paralympic debut in Paris in 2024

British Para-triathlete Henry Urand has added the European title to his world crown with a superb performance in Besancon, France.

Urand, who was fourth at the Paris Paralympics in the PTS3 division, finished almost a minute and a half ahead of his closest rival - Paralympic silver medallist Max Gelhaar of Germany.

The 22-year-old was well down the field after the swim but gradually made up ground on the bike leg to contest the lead.

He then went clear on the run to claim gold in one hour 11 minutes and 41 seconds.

Team-mate Mel Nicholls took silver in the women's wheelchair division while Josh Landman was third in the men's wheelchair event.

However, there was disappointment for Paralympic champions Dave Ellis and guide Luke Pollard after a mechanical problem with their bike ended their men's VI race early.

Experts revealed that Darren O'Dea played for Republic of Ireland Under-21s with Alan Sheehan

Swansea City have appointed Celtic's Darren O'Dea as their new assistant boss to head coach Alan Sheehan.

In March, Sheehan added former team-mates Richard Stearman and Mark Fotheringham to his backroom team on short-term deals, with Stearman, 37, continuing his role after Sheehan was appointed Swansea's head coach on a permanent basis.

That has now seen his fellow Irishman O'Dea appointed as assistant, with the 38-year-old leaving his role on Celtic's staff as professional player pathway manager and B team coach under former Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers.

Sheehan's coaching staff will be completed by head of goalkeeping Martyn Margetson and first-team coach Kris O'Leary.

Sheehan said: "I am delighted to have Darren and Richard join the coaching staff.

"They are two guys I trust, and who have an incredible work ethic. They have shown a great desire to be here at Swansea City.

"These are exactly the sort of people we need to help us move forward, and I am really happy we have been able to come to an agreement for them to join Swansea City."

As a player, O'Dea represented the likes of Celtic, Reading, Leeds United, Blackpool and Dundee, as well as having spells in Canada, Ukraine and India.

Dublin-born O'Dea won 20 caps for the Republic of Ireland having played international youth football in the same sides as Sheehan, who is also 38.

O'Dea began his coaching career at Motherwell before returning to Celtic in 2019.

He was initially under-18s boss before stepping up to take charge of Celtic B in 2021, and became player pathway manager in 2024.

Swansea also confirmed that Fotheringham will leave the club to pursue new opportunities, having served as first-team coach alongside Stearman towards the end of the season.

"We want to thank Mark for the role he played towards the end of last season, he was excellent for us," added Sheehan.

"We had a conversation and we part ways on very good terms, we wish him all the very best for the future."

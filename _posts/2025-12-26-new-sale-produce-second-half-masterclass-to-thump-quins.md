Here’s what you need to know: Jacques Vermeulen scored his first two tries for Sale in their win against Harlequins

Sale scored five tries in a dazzling second-half performance to totally outclass Prem rivals Harlequins on Boxing Day.

Quins took a five-point lead in at the break thanks to tries from Marcus Smith and Jack Walker at the start and end of the half.

But the Sharks scored 31 unanswered points in a clinical display in the second period, with tries from Jacques Vermeulen [two], Rekeiti Ma'asi-White, Raffi Quirke and former Quin Nathan Jibulu as the visitors crumbled in Greater Manchester.

The hosts remain seventh in the table but move within three points of sixth-placed Saracens, while Harelquins are 16 points off the play-off places with eight matches played.

George Ford kicked two successful conversions for Sale

Quins' annual 'Big Game' at Twickenham didn't go to plan against Bristol last weekend as they found themselves 26-0 down at half-time before ultimately surrendering to a 40-14 defeat.

They got off to the perfect start here as Smith capitalised on Luke Cowan-Dickie's overthrown, quick lineout to give them them an early lead.

But the hosts soon got on the ball and begin to dictate the play, with Alex Wills dotting down his second Prem try before Cowan-Dickie drove home at the back of the maul to atone for his earlier mistake.

Yet Jack Walker's try with the final act of the first half had the visitors in front at the break, though the lead wouldn't last much longer as the Sharks recovered to totally dominate the second half.

A quick double for Vermeulen, his first tries since joining the club from Exeter, swung the tie in their favour and set them on their way to a big win as Harlequins collapsed.

Ma'asi-White's try was followed by possibly the moment of the match as Quirke, having been moved out to the wing, played a long kick forward into the corner and put on a spectacular chase to hunt down Smith on his own line.

The England fly-half had just been moved to full-back and slipped as he went to catch the ball, with Quirke free to score his side's fourth of the half.

By the time Jibulu scored the fifth the visitors were well beaten. Jason Gilmore's side will need to pick themselves up after two big defeats before travelling to Northampton next weekend.

But for Alex Sanderson and Sale, it's a morale-boosting victory that will give them belief they can make a charge for the play-offs.

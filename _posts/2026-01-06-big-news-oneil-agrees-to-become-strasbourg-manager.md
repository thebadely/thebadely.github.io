Let's dive into the details: O'Neil is set for a return to management after over a year out of the game

Gary O'Neil has agreed to become Strasbourg's manager after Liam Rosenior left the French club to join sister club Chelsea.

O'Neil, 42, has been without a club since he was sacked by Wolves in December 2024.

He previously had a year-long spell at Bournemouth in the 2022-23 season, helping the south coast club avoid relegation before being sacked and replaced by Andoni Iraola.

His appointment at Strasbourg comes before a Coupe de France tie against third-tier Avranches on Saturday.

Strasbourg is owned by the same American group as the Chelsea and some supporters have expressed frustration at Rosenior's exit.

In a statement, Strasbourg Supporters' Federation said: "The transfer of Liam Rosenior marks another humiliating step in Racing's subservience to Chelsea. 

"For two and a half years, along with others, we have been trying to raise the alarm about this.

"The problem goes far beyond the mid-season sporting impact and the ambitions of a young coach. It is structural - the future of French club football is at stake."

In November, Strasbourg president Marc Keller argued that owners BlueCo have been positive for the club, having invested more than Â£100m in the summer transfer window, with multi-club ownership now a common reality in modern football. He pointed to investment in the stadium, women's team and academy.

Keller and new sporting director David Weir, who joined the French side after leaving Brighton in the summer, oversaw O'Neil's appointment.

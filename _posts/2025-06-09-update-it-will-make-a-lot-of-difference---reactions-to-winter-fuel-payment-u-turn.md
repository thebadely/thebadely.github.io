It has been recently reported that More than three-quarters of pensioners will receive the winter fuel payment this year after a major policy U-turn.

The decision from Chancellor Rachel Reeves means nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of £35,000 or less will now be eligible.

People have spoken to us or contacted the BBC through Your Voice, Your BBC News about how the change of plan will affect them.

Bob Pritchard, 78, from Bath, told the BBC he earns £19,500 a year and believes he will now have his allowance reinstated.

"It will make a lot of difference. I've got various health issues and have to travel to hospital by taxi. I can't really afford to do it. The winter fuel payment was more or less taken away without warning," he said,

Despite being happy about the government's U-turn, Bob believes he should be compensated for how he struggled when his winter fuel payment was taken away last year.

"The least they could do is offer some small compensation for all the grief and heartache that the initial decision to stop winter fuel payments has caused," he said.

Alice George, 71, from Watford says she is "appalled" by Reeves' decision and gives her own winter fuel payment to charity.

"I know people who put the money towards a holiday," she said.

"I constantly meet pensioners who live very comfortably. I go to the cinema and the theatre regularly and they are packed with my ilk, most of whom don't need this money."

Alice thinks its unfair that some young people earning less than £30,000 are expected to pay what she calls "extortionate rent and travel expenses".

She thinks the winter fuel payment money should be put towards the NHS or tackling the housing crisis.

Ian Bryant, from Nailsworth in Gloucestershire, is pleased with the government's decision.

He earns more than £35,000 as a pensioner so will not be receiving the payment himself but is happy for the others who will.

"It wasn't ideal when the payment was removed last year, as it impacted on many of those on the lowest income although I understand why it was done. A more considered approach would have been better," he said.

"I'm 68 and still have a mortgage. I go away a couple of times a year - nothing five star - have an old car, but manage fine. I'm more than happy not to receive the payment."

Gail Impey, 71, a finance manager from Buckinghamshire, will miss out on the payment as her income is just over £35,000.

She said she struggled last year when her winter fuel payment was taken away.

"I turned off all the heating and used all my saved up logs in my log burner," she said.

Gail's husband died in 2021, which meant she could no longer retire as she said she could not afford to stop working.

"Luckily at 71 I am fit enough to work but I do not have a good quality of life. It's just me and the dog. Everything is so expensive, I have to make every penny count," she said.

She added: "I earn just over the threshold but I'm taxed on that. I have paid in all my life and it seems I am missing out again. This is not fair and being on my own I have to work harder than ever."

Mike Hodges, 72, says he did not miss the winter fuel payment when he stopped receiving it.

He says his income is above the £35,000 threshold but below £40,000.

"The threshold could be a lot lower so money can be spent on much more pressing priorities."

He thinks the money spent on the fuel payments should go to initiatives for younger people instead.

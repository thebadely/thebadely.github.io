Caroline Dubois became WBC lightweight champion almost a year ago

Caroline Dubois is hopeful she can finally fight Terri Harper in a lightweight unification bout in 2026.

WBC champion Dubois has been exchanging verbal spars with British rival and WBO belt holder Harper for the best part of a year, but they have been unable to come to terms for a unification bout.

Both are now both signed to Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions, with Dubois making her promotional debut on Friday in Miami.

"I know for a fact [Harper] signed with MVP hoping to get away from me," Dubois said.

"I don't think about Terri. She's kind of irrelevant to me.

"The only thing I care about is the belt and she's unfortunately holding on to it.

"I think she signed with MVP hoping to slither her way out of [a fight], but guess what? I signed with them now. There's no running."

Dubois, 24, signed with MVP this month having turned professional with UK-based promotion Boxxer.

She says she turned down several offers from MVP in recent months.

The unbeaten Londoner says being promised regular fights in the UK was key to her joining, as well as them having Harper and unified super-featherweight champion Alycia Baumgardner in their stable.

"I think we're going to make [the Harper] fight happen next. Just a matter of where and when. I hope she can find her pen when it comes to it," Dubois added.

Baumgardner, 31, defends her world titles on Friday on the same card as Dubois, with both women key figures on the undercard for Jake Paul's bout with Anthony Joshua.

Dubois is keen to fight Baumgardner in the future and has been following the American's career closely at the weight below her.

"She likes to walk around like she is the biggest, baddest fish in the pond and I believe that's not true. I believe I am," Dubois said.

"When she brings that energy it triggers me a little bit. It's important we're on the same card and people can see and use us as a yard stick and make up their own minds."

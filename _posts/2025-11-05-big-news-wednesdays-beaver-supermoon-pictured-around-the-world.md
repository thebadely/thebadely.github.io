According to new developments, People around the world have been able to catch a glimpse of the Beaver supermoon as it rose on Wednesday.

The largest, brightest Moon of the year has been shining in all its glory in the areas lucky enough to have a clear sky. 

Wednesday's supermoon is bigger and brighter than earlier supermoons this year due to the fact that it is the closest full Moon to Earth.

This happens because the Moon does not orbit the Earth in a perfect circle - its axis of orbit more closely resembles an oval.

The name Beaver Moon follows a longstanding tradition of nicknaming supermoons. 

While there is some disagreement as to the origins of the name, some sources attribute it to First Nations tribes in North America historically setting beaver traps in November.

The last supermoon of the year will follow this month's Beaver Moon, taking place on 4 December.

Photographers across the globe have been sharing their photos while out and about capturing the supermoon.

It has been recently reported that The match was abandoned about 90 minutes after the players first left the field

India claimed a 2-1 win in their T20 series against Australia after the fifth and final match in Brisbane was washed out.

After losing the toss and being asked to bat, openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill steered India to 52-0 after 4.5 overs before a thunderstorm forced the players from the field.

Though the storm moved on, heavy rain persisted and the umpires decided no further play was possible.

It is the second match of the series to be washed out after the opener in Canberra on 29 October.

Australia won the second game in Melbourne, but victories in Hobart and the Gold Coast secured the series for the tourists.

India will defend their T20 World Cup title as co-hosts with Sri Lanka in February.

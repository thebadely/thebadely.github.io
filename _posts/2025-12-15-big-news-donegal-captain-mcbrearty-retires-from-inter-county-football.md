According to new developments, Patrick McBrearty was part of Donegal's 2012 All-Ireland winning team

Donegal captain Patrick McBrearty has retired from inter-county football on medical advice.

A statement issued by his county on Monday explained that the decision for the 32-year-old to call it a day had been taken in light of "the sustained recurrence of a knee injury which has hindered the Kilcar clubman in recent seasons".

During a distinguished 15-year career, McBrearty won seven Ulster Senior Championship medals, a record for a Donegal footballer.

He was an All-Ireland winner in 2012 and represented Ireland three times in international rules matches.

His tally of Donegal appearances stands at 167, with 82 of those accumulated in Championship matches.

The forward played in July's All-Ireland final defeat by Kerry, replacing Oisin Gallen after 49 minutes of the Croke Park contest.

Paying tribute to McBrearty, County Board chairperson, Mary Coughlan, said that he "has had an extraordinary career and has set the bar extremely high for the next generation".

"He's been a tremendous ambassador for Donegal GAA and has carried himself with dignity both on and off the field. His retirement leaves a great void but the player has been plagued by injury in recent seasons."

"It is fitting that he leaves with a record haul of medals and since being appointed captain in 2022, he has always led by example and worn the county jersey with fierce pride and distinction," she concluded.

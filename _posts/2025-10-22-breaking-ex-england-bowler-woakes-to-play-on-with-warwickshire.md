Experts revealed that Chris Woakes made his debut for Warwickshire as a 17-year-old in 2006

Former England all-rounder Chris Woakes has signed a new two-year contract with Warwickshire until the end of the 2027 season.

The 36-year-old retired from international cricket last month after playing 62 Tests, 122 one-day matches and 33 T20 games for England.

He has, though, decided to carry on at county level and his new deal will cover all formats of the game, taking him past 20 years with the Bears.

"Extending my commitment to Warwickshire for another two years feels like the start of a new chapter with a club that properly feels like home," Woakes told the club website., external

"We've got a talented squad, with a good mix of youth and experience, and I genuinely believe we are in a great position to be challenging for trophies."

Woakes was a member of Warwickshire's 2012 and 2021 County Championship winning teams, and has also enjoyed success with the club in white-ball cricket, lifting the One-Day Cup in 2010 and 2016 and the T20 Blast trophy, as Birmingham Bears, in 2014.

He has taken 628 first-class wickets, at an average of 25.96, and 428 in limited overs cricket, playing in T20 tournaments around the world and for Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred.

Performance director James Thomas said: "He's someone all our aspiring young players can look up to, as an example of how to perform to the very top level over such a long period of time.

"Chris's experience with both bat and ball will be invaluable as we look to improve and develop our squad, which is now capable of challenging for major honours."

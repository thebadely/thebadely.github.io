Lottie Woad's impressive professional debut continued as she shot a second-round 65 to take a two-shot lead at the Women's Scottish Open.

The 21-year-old again outscored playing partner and world number one Nelly Korda, who is tied-second with Denmark's Nanna Koerstz Madsen.

Starting at the 10th at Dundonald Links, it took Englishwoman Woad five holes to make her first birdie, adding two more before making a run of four in seven holes from the third.

That took her to 12 under par, with just one bogey in 36 holes.

Scotland's Gemma Dryburgh shot a superb 67 to make the cut after a disappointing 78 on the opening day, while England's Georgia Hall is four under for the tournament.

Woad, who won the Irish Open earlier this month, announced her decision to turn professional last week after missing out on Â£400,000 in prize money at the Evian Championship, the fourth women's major of the year.

The former world number one amateur finished just a shot outside the play-off won by Grace Kim at that event.

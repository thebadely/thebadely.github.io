Experts revealed that Kelsie Burrows was shown a red card after Cliftonville Ladies' 2-0 win against Glentoran Women last month

Cliftonville captain Kelsie Burrows has been handed a 16-match ban for an alleged assault on a match official.

The Northern Ireland international was shown a red card by referee Simon Bickerstaff after the Reds' 2-0 win against Glentoran Women on 25 July.

The suspension is effective immediately and covers all competitions but it is understood that the club are appealing against the decision, which means Burrows will be available to play in Friday's Premiership game against Crusaders Strikers.

Team coach Brendan Lynch has been handed a three-match ban from the same game for "entering the field of play to confront a match official".

The incident came after the final whistle of the victory over Glentoran, which put Cliftonville right in the mix at the top of the table as they currently sit six points off leaders Linfield with two games in hand.

Cliftonville, the Irish Football Association and NIFL have been contacted by BBC Sport NI for comment.

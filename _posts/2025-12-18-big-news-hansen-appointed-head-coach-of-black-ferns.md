Let's dive into the details: Whitney Hansen was an assistant coach when New Zealand beat England in the 2022 Women's Rugby World Cup final

New Zealand Rugby has appointed Whitney Hansen head coach of the Black Ferns until the end of 2027.

Hansen, daughter of former All Blacks head coach Steve, takes over from Allan Bunting to become only the 13th person to hold the position.

The former Matatu coach is also only the second woman to be placed in charge of the Black Ferns, after Vicky Dombroski in 1994.

She will oversee 11 Tests next year followed by a historic series against a touring British and Irish Lions women's squad in 2027.

"It's an honour to be asked to lead the programme and an exciting time to take on the role of head coach," Hansen said. 

"There is generational talent coming through in women's rugby in New Zealand, and the new international calendar represents a huge opportunity to further enhance the legacy of the Black Ferns. I can't wait to get started."

New Zealand, who had won six of the previous seven Women's Rugby World Cups, were knocked out in the semi-finals of the 2025 edition by Canada before beating France to finish third.

Hosts England defeated Canada in the final to lift the trophy.

However, Hansen did play a part in New Zealand's Women's Rugby World Cup triumph at Eden Park in 2022, as an assistant coach.

She will be joined by assistant coaches Tony Christie and former England centre Riki Flutey, with the wider coaching and management group set to be confirmed in the new year.

Hansen, who is a teacher by trade, represented Canterbury during her playing days and has held senior roles at every level of the game since taking up coaching.

She was assistant coach of Matatu's 2023 Sky Super Rugby Aupiki title-winning side before becoming the club's head of rugby for the past two seasons. 

From 2020 to 2023 she was in charge of Canterbury's set-piece in the Farah Palmer Cup as the team won two titles in three years, before becoming the inaugural head coach of the Black Ferns XV in 2024.

Here’s what you need to know: The Daily Telegraph leads with the breakdown of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump over Ukraine. It says they were called off because Russia refused to accept America's terms for a ceasefire. The paper says Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Moscow would not settle for an agreement that "froze" the front lines in Ukraine.

Reports that the chancellor is planning to use the Budget to impose a new charge on professionals employed by "limited liability partnerships" is the lead in The Times. The paper says such partnerships, which are common for lawyers and GPs, offer a significant tax benefit, as workers are treated as self-employed. It is, the Times says, a "tax raid" on the middle class which could yield £2bn for the Treasury.

A shift in family law meaning that courts will no longer assume it is in the best interests of children to be in contact with their parents is the Guardian's lead. The paper says campaigners have hailed it as a "victory" for children facing domestic abuse and a move that will "save so many children's lives".

A number of papers continue to explore Prince Andrew's living arrangements at Royal Lodge on the Windsor Estate. The Daily Mail quotes property experts as saying that he has a "cast iron lease", and a Whitehall source saying his lease appeared to be "watertight".

But the Daily Telegraph says Prince Andrew's future at Royal Lodge is in doubt after the collapse of a business deal. The paper says its sources have confirmed that a commercial partnership the prince had with a Dutch company, which gave him proof of an independent income to pay for the upkeep of the estate, was now "dead in the water".

The Sun's front page carries a photo of Prince Andrew on horseback with a headline reflecting the call from some MPs and trafficking survivors for him to leave the mansion and be formally stripped of his dukedom. "Off you trot, Mr Windsor", is the main headline.

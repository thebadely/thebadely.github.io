James is so difficult to defend against - White

"There's no ceiling on her talent - we're looking at a potential global star."

The plaudits were many for Lauren James following England's brilliant 4-0 Group D win over the Netherlands, but the words of Brighton striker Nikita Parris summed up how highly she is rated.

When the defending European champions had their backs against the wall at Euro 2025, the Chelsea forward stepped up to deliver.

James dazzled against the Dutch, scoring the Lionesses' first and third goals as they went from a potential early exit to the cusp of the quarter-finals.

Following criticism in their opening-game defeat by France, she provided much-needed inspiration for England to claim a vital first victory in the tournament.

Her first strike was superb as she finished off a sweet counter-attack with three tight touches to get the ball out of her feet and finish with a dreamy drive into the top corner from the edge of the box.

The second on the hour mark was effectively the moment that sealed the success at 3-0 - a calm sweeping first-time finish into the bottom corner from 10 yards out after Ella Toone's effort had been saved.

James' nonchalant celebration of pretending to put her hands in her pockets and staring down the camera almost does her performance a disservice.

The goals were far from routine and in a pressured environment with so much at stake for her team.

They were special strikes by a special player to kickstart England's Euros defence into life.

James was also described as "unstoppable" and a "massive talent" by England team-mate Toone after the impressive showing.

Defender Jess Carter added the 23-year-old was a "phenomenal player" who "thrives under pressure", while Georgia Stanway called her "class".

The England camp love James, who responded superbly to a below-par performance from her and the team against France on Saturday. 

She had the fewest amount of touches in that game of all the starting players, before being substituted with England 2-0 down after 60 minutes.

Undeterred, manager Sarina Wiegman gave James even more attacking freedom against the Dutch, allowing her to roam in the inside-right channel and often making late darts forward to overload the box.

Those runs often led to confusion in the Dutch defence with who should have been marking James when she skipped between the lines? A midfielder dropping back or a defender pushing up and leaving space in behind?

"The variety of threat James provides for this England side is tremendous," former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley told BBC Radio 5 Live. "If I was facing her I would have broken my ankles from being turned inside and out."

James took the joint-most shots in England's win (five), all while having the game's best passing accuracy (93.8%) and regularly carving out chances for team-mates.

"We want James in our starting 11. That is her position coming off that right-hand-side," added ex-England captain Steph Houghton on BBC One.

"Having that defensive responsibility is not her game. We need her on the ball, we need her to make things happen.

"That was a very assured performance and a great tactical change by Sarina Wiegman."

Lauren James celebrated her first goal by pretending to put her hands in pockets and staring down the TV cameras. The picture on the right shows James' heat map against the Netherlands. The forward found plenty of joy in the inside-right channel 

Well done if you remembered we've been here before. 

James was also England's creative force in their run to the World Cup final two years ago, even if she did miss two matches through suspension and was often limited to appearances off the bench.

She has now been directly involved in eight goals in just five starts at major tournaments (World Cups and European Championships - five goals, three assists), the most of any player who has appeared at both Euro 2025 and the 2023 World Cup.

And, after England's record goalscorer Ellen White, James is only the second Lioness to net twice in both a World Cup and European Championship match.

"Lauren James has a wonderful aura. She is cool, calm, and collected," White said on BBC One.

"I would love to have some of that talent. England work defensively for James and it gives her the freedom to roam."

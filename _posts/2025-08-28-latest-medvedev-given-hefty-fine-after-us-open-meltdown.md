Let's dive into the details: Daniil Medvedev's fine is believed to be among the biggest punishments dished out by US Open officials

Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has been handed a substantial fine for his behaviour in a extraordinary first-round exit.

Medvedev, 29, was knocked out of the Grand Slam tournament after a meltdown sparked by a photographer walking on to the court during his defeat by France's Benjamin Bonzi.

The former world number one has been fined almost Â£31,500 ($42,500) by the United States Tennis Association.

He was docked $30,000 for unsportsmanlike behaviour and another $12,500 for obliterating a racket against a chair.

It means the Russian will have to forfeit about 40% of the first-round prize money he received.

After the incident on Sunday, Medvedev said he was prepared for a hefty punishment.

"I'm getting a big enough fine, so if I speak, I'm in big trouble, so I'm not going to speak," he said.

Medvedev beaten after photographer enters court

As the Russian faced match point at 5-4 in the third set, a photographer encroached the playing surface between Bonzi's first and second serves.

Medvedev, who won the New York title in 2021, was incensed when umpire Greg Allensworth awarded another first serve to Bonzi following the bizarre moment.

Staring defeat in the face, Medvedev marched over to the official and incited a frenzied New York crowd before shouting at Allensworth.

The match was delayed for more than six minutes before the crowd calmed down sufficiently for Bonzi to resume.

He was unable to serve out in a febrile atmosphere and Medvedev fought back to take the match into a deciding fifth set.

After eventually losing a chaotic encounter, Medvedev brutally destroyed a racquet before sitting dejectedly on his chair for several minutes until eventually leaving the court.

It has been recently reported that If your New Year's resolution is to stop wearing the same three outfits on rotation (don't worry I'm not judging) then you've come to the right place.

Thanks to the way the fashion calendar works, we already know what the brightest minds in the industry think we will be wearing when the weather becomes a little warmer.

Labels showcased their designs for the upcoming spring/summer season across shows in London, Paris, Milan and New York earlier this year.

Here are six of the hottest trends you can incorporate into your wardrobe in 2026.

We normally associate spring fashion with ditsy florals and calming pastels, but this season's runways were all about bold block colours.

The catwalks of big fashion houses such as Loewe, Dior and Fendi were awash with rainbow brights in yellow, red and green, with some mixing and matching shades for added dramatic effect.

Belgian designer Meryll Rogge's show also featured head-turning outfits in electric blue.

Style tip: If you want to replicate this style yourself, try focusing on wearing one statement item in a bold colour so it really stands out.

Quiet luxury was the trend of 2025 - focusing on elegance and simplicity, it was about choosing timeless classics in quality fabrics that could be worn again and again.

But it appears the fashion world is already looking to leave that aesthetic behind and usher in a new era of loud luxury.

Maximalism was a clear theme in the upcoming season's shows - it was all about voluminous dresses and skirts, luxurious fabrics and chunky jewellery. 

Saint Laurent's models wore head-to-toe black leather, whilst Missoni's were clad in their signature chevron print designs, complete with statement necklaces. Balenciaga and Chanel focused on feathers in dramatic colours and textures.

Style tip: If you want to channel this look, you'll need to find the most brash items in your wardrobe and find a way to pair them together.

Fashion choices are often a reflection of what's going on in the world around us, with some trend forecasters indicating that the increase of embellished pieces - such as tasselled bags and fringed skirts - is due to global economic uncertainty.

In times of financial trouble, investment pieces with bold, eye-catching designs become the go-to as a way to add something extra to an otherwise ordinary outfit.

Australian label Aje's catwalk was full of delightful fringed pieces, whilst Balmain's models graced the runway with huge, suede messenger bags.

Ellie Saab and Louis Vuitton's neon fringed and tasselled dresses and trousers also stood out, as models sashayed down the catwalk in their designs.

Style tip: You probably own something that fits into this trend already, as it comes back around often, but if you don't, a fringed leather or suede bag is easy to come by on secondhand websites and in vintage stores or charity shops.

We know embellishment is one of the biggest trends for next spring and summer - with extravagantly textured items also seen across many runways.

Chloe's ethereal runway featured floral bustiers and elegantly ruched tops and dresses, whilst Moschino's models wore ruched, frilly two-pieces in clashing colours.

There were dramatic layers and frills on display at Zimmermann, whilst Isabel Marant took a completely different turn, with layered rara skirts strewn with pom poms.

Style tip: Perhaps the most appealing part of this trend is that you can make it your own. Designers featured frills, fabric layers and ruching in a variety of colours and styles, meaning you could easily re-fashion your own items to reflect the mismatched clothes on display here.

A trench coat is a wardrobe staple for many - perfect for the transitional period between spring and summer, and also autumn and winter.

This season, trenches were everywhere - mostly in the trademark light beige, but some fashion houses decided to add a twist with vibrant inner linings like Celine or different fabrics and colours at Saint Laurent.

Ellie Saab's runway featured slinky trenches that were tightly belted and Givenchy's designs appeared lighter in colour with bold black buttons and buckles.

Style tip: Trench coats never truly go out of style, so you can be sure if you invest in one that you'll certainly get enough wear out of it.

Amongst the maximalism, bold colours and textures on display at this season's fashion weeks was something for the more corporate fashion fans.

Fashion houses made having a job look both cool and fun, with Stella McCartney and Bottega Veneta reinventing the classic suit for women and borrowing from the 1980s power-dressing trend.

Some designers also put a fun twist on the idea of the uniform, layering dresses with shirts and jumpers.

Thom Browne took it to the next level with a skirt made entirely of ties.

Style tip: Achieving this style is actually pretty simple - find a shirt, jumper or vest and get layering for an office-ready look.

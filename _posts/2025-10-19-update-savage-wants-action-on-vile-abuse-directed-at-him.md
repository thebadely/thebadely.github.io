It has been recently reported that Robbie Savage's Forest Green Rovers side are fifth in the National League

Forest Green Rovers manager Robbie Savage says more action needs to be taken against the "vile abuse" he has suffered from opposition fans.

Savage's side were beaten 4-2 at Carlisle United on Saturday in the National League and the former Wales midfielder says he was subjected to abuse that "crossed the line".

"I'll take the banter, and when they're singing songs about me as an individual I've got no problem," Savage told BBC Radio Gloucestershire after the loss.

"But when it crosses the line, when it becomes nasty and some of the stuff said is wrong, what's done about it?

"I'll continue to stand there and take that abuse because I'm expected to, because it's me - and it's not acceptable."

A combative midfielder in his playing days for the likes of Leicester City and Derby County, Savage became a high-profile pundit after retiring from playing. 

He still presents the 606 phone-in show on BBC Radio 5 Live alongside his managerial duties at Rovers and is known for splitting opinions among his listeners.

But Savage, who turned 51 on Saturday, says not enough is being done when people go too far with personal abuse.

"Stewards, volunteers, whoever's standing there, it's [still] allowed to happen consistently," he added.

"I don't mind banter. I've had photos with kids, with youngsters there and I'm prepared to stand there and get hurled the most shocking abuse by people of varying ages, probably in high-powered positions at work.

"They think it's acceptable they can come and hurl vile abuse at a human being - it's not acceptable, but nothing will be done about it.

"It happens all the time, it happened the other night at Worthing and it's happened again today.

"I don't think it's acceptable, but nothing's going to be done, nothing's ever done."

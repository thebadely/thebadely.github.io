Here’s what you need to know: London City Lionesses were the first fully independent team to be promoted to the Women's Super League

London City Lionesses have sacked manager Jocelyn Precheur midway through their debut Women's Super League season.

It is understood the club have a replacement lined up for Precheur, who guided London City to promotion in 2024-25.

Players and staff were informed of the decision on Sunday.

It is believed the club have not made the decision based on results but with the view to changing their plans for the long term, and they do not see the Frenchman as the right manager to guide them through the next stage of their development. â¨â¨

It comes as a shock, as London City sit in sixth place with five wins from their first 11 matches.

Precheur, 43, who joined London City in 2024 from Paris St-Germain, has been part of the club during a period of major investment by ambitious multi-club owner Michele Kang. 

Former England winger Sue Smith told BBC Radio 5 Live Kang wants London City to be among the best in the WSL. 

"When you see a new team coming up you think give the manager time to work with these players and get them up the league," said Smith. 

"But when you listen to Michele, she always talks about London City Lionesses as a team that's going to challenge at the top of the table, not a team that's going to consolidate in the league."

London City, the only WSL team to not have an affiliated men's team, were promoted as winners of last season's Championship - the competition now known as WSL 2.

They play home matches at Hayes Lane - a stadium they share with Bromley, who play in League Two in men's football.

The club has been transformed under the leadership of Kang, whose wealth has been estimated at $1.2bn (Â£890m) by Forbes.

The American businesswoman bought the Lionesses in December 2023, when the team were on the brink of liquidation.

London City have won five and lost six of their WSL matches so far.

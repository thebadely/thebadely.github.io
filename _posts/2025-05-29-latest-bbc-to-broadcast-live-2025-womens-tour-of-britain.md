It has been recently reported that Belgian Lotte Kopecky (right) won the 2024 Women's Tour of Britain

BBC Sport will broadcast live this year's Lloyds Women's Tour of Britain as part of its Women's Summer of Sport coverage. 

The four-day race across England and Scotland begins on 5 June and will be aired live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Several of Britain's best riders will compete in the event, including two-time winner Lizzie Deignan and her Lidl-Trek team-mate and 2024 Olympic silver medallist Anna Henderson.

Leading prospects Cat Ferguson of Movistar and Imogen Wolff, who rides for Visma-Lease a Bike, are also involved.

As part of BBC Sport's Women's Summer of Sport coverage, the Women's Euros, Women's Rugby World Cup and World Athletics Championships will be live across the BBC alongside Wimbledon, The Hundred cricket tournament and the tennis at Queen's, where women will compete for the first time in more than 50 years.

"The Tour of Britain Women will be another great moment for women's sport this summer and we're delighted to bring this event to fans across the UK through our popular digital platforms," said Alex Kay-Jelski, Director of BBC Sport.

"The BBC has a strong track record of backing women's sport. Not just the victories, but the stories, the grit and the passion behind them. And as the UK's most-used sports broadcaster, we're proud to shine a spotlight on this race and its great cyclists."

The Tour of Britain Women was rescued by British Cycling last year after being cancelled in 2023 because of funding issues.

According to new developments, Cameron Norrie has the most wins by a British man this season (32)

Cameron Norrie is through to the Moselle Open quarter-finals after coming from behind to defeat Frenchman Arthur Cazaux in three sets, while Novak Djokovic progressed in Athens.

British number three Norrie prevailed in a hard-fought 6-7 (1-7) 7-6 (9-7) 6-2 win in Metz, France, to reach his fifth tour-level quarter-final of the season - and his first since Wimbledon in July.

The 30-year-old will play a third consecutive home player next, with French lucky losers Dan Added and Kyrian Jacquet meeting on Wednesday.

World number 27 Norrie, runner-up last year, made a positive start and broke the 69th-ranked Cazaux's serve in the opening game.

But after Cazaux levelled the set, Norrie had to survive a break point to take the first set to a tie-break, which the home favourite dominated.

Both players failed to find a breakthrough as the second set also headed to a tie-break - but Norrie kept pace on this occasion and eventually seized his fourth set point with a sweeping forehand winner.

Norrie carried that momentum into the decider, capitalising on a struggling Cazaux's fading energy with an immediate break, before racing to the finish line after midnight local time.

"It's always a battle, he's a very talented player. I had to fight hard to get myself into the match and I had to pick some battles with myself," said Norrie.

"I just told myself I wanted to be here and I wanted to be playing."

The Moselle Open and Athens Open are the two ATP 250 events taking place in the final week of the regular season, before the ATP Finals - featuring the season's top eight players - begins in Turin on Sunday.

Djokovic reached his 225th tour-level quarter-final by claiming his first victory over Alejandro Tabilo at the Athens Open.

Chile's Tabilo had won both previous meetings with Djokovic - but Roger Federer remains the only player to record a 3-0 head-to-head start against the record 24-time men's Grand Slam champion.

But after prevailing in a first-set tie-break, the 38-year-old Serb extended his record of winning every match in which he has won the first set this season to 28 as he cruised to a 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 win.

Djokovic won 20 of the final 23 points in a dominant finish to the match.

Chasing the 101st singles title of his career in the Greek capital, Djokovic will next play Nuno Borges on Thursday after the Portuguese sixth seed pulled off a comeback 5-7 6-3 6-4 win over American Eliot Spizzirri.

Let's dive into the details: Gary Wilson has won three ranking titles in his career

England's Gary Wilson will face defending champion Xiao Guodong in the Wuhan Open final after beating Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the semi-finals.

Wilson, ranked 18th in the world, was 2-1 down against 11th-ranked Allen, but won five successive frames to progress.

China's world number 14 Xiao, who won the tournament in 2024, beat Mark Williams 6-3 in the other semi-final.

Xiao, who comes from Chongqing which neighbours Wuhan's Hubei Province, moved ahead with a break of 75 after the first four frames had been shared.

Wales' Williams, ranked fifth in the world, levelled to make it 3-3, but Xiao won the next two frames before coming from 58-0 down with a break of 68 to seal victory.

Xiao said it was an "honour" to play "legends" like Williams.

"After losing to Mark in the Champion of Champions final last year, beating him this time is a big boost to my confidence," he told the World Snooker Tour website.

Saturday's final will be the best of 19 frames and begins at 07:00 BST.

Let's dive into the details: When Danny Rohl took over the job as head coach, Rangers were at 14-1 to win the Scottish Premiership. For the Ibrox club, those were stunningly long odds.

Yet that was the dire situation they were in at the time. Now, they are just six points behind league leaders Hearts and the pressure is certainly on.

When the German first came in, results turned quickly but performances took a little longer to follow.

Now there is a feeling that the head coach is starting to get his squad - that many had written off - firing, and they will soon be further helped by his winter additions.

How has he turned round the ship that, under Russell Martin, was struggling in choppy waters? And what does he still need to do in the window?

Rangers' Europa League fate sealed despite Ludogorets win

While it was not enough to keep the Glasgow club's hopes of progression going, the 1-0 Europa League triumph over Ludogorets made it seven wins in a row for Rohl and Rangers. 

The wind is fully in their sails, and the victory over the Hungarians only added to the good feeling that has slowly returned to Ibrox.

Rohl has lost five of his 21 matches in charge so far, with just one of those defeats coming in the Premiership, to the league leaders Hearts.

"Given how the campaign has gone so far, it has to be seen as a positive," pundit James McFadden said of Rangers' performance on Thursday night. "It has been really poor in Europe this season but they've definitely turned a corner.

"When you're winning games, it becomes a habit. It's a very good habit to have. You have to be at it in every single game."

The progression and improvement is there to be seen in multiple players. 

Nicolas Raskin finished last season as Rangers' most valuable player. A fractious relationship with Martin threatened to stunt his growth at Ibrox, but under Rohl he has rediscovered some of his best form.

Keen to play as a number six, he was involved in and won more duels against Ludogorets than any other player. He made six tackles, winning three of them - a high in the Rangers team.

The Belgian created more chances, had more touches, and more accurate passes than any other player on the pitch.

His midfield partner Mohamed Diomande, scorer of the winning goal, is also enjoying a resurgence in form. Nine touches in the opposition box shows his desire to get further forward, while his 97% pass accuracy epitomises the consistency Rangers have started to show.

Youssef Chermiti has just four goals from his 25 Rangers' appearances so far

While Youssef Chermiti earned rave reviews for his Old Firm heroics at the start of the month, he and Bojan Miovski passed up chances on Thursday and questions still linger over their ability to hold down the number nine shirt.

"Rangers aren't the finished article, there's still work to be done but they're going in the right direction," McFadden said. "There has been big progression, but they need to strengthen at the top end.

"They're winning games. Are they at their free-flowing best? No, but it doesn't matter. Somehow, they've managed to get themselves into a title race."

At least there have been some reinforcements. Toko Chukwuani has come in as a defensive midfielder, and Rohl has also brought in left-back Tuur Rommens - a problem position given Jayden Meghoma was the only natural in the position - and winger Andreas Skov Olsen.

The latter is considered a big coup, on loan from Wolfsburg, and adds much-needed quality to the wings. Djiedi Gassama's form has tailed off, and although Mikey Moore has come onto a game, Oliver Antman is still out injured.

Ineligible for the win over Ludogorets, the trio are expected to feature in some capacity against Dundee. That game could be vital in the grand scheme of the season, due to Hearts and Celtic meeting at Tynecastle the same day.

"I thought this season was a write-off," admitted pundit Steven Thompson at Ibrox. "There were changes at board level, the recruitment wasn't anywhere near good enough but Danny Rohl has flipped the script.

"You've got to give him so much credit for that. At times the football was good tonight, at times it was just OK. But it's a clean sheet in Europe, and it just keeps this feel-good factor going."

If the other two title contenders knock points off each other, Rangers could be within three points. Heady heights from the early days of Martin.

"Danny Rohl has done an absolutely fantastic job with this group of players," said ex-Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday. "There is that lingering question - can they go that extra yard? A lot of people didn't this group of players could step up.

"I think they need help, and the biggest help they could be given is a number nine at the top end of the pitch."

Here’s what you need to know: Jamaldeen Jimoh-Aloba started his youth career with West Brom before joining Aston Villa in 2023

Aston Villa match-winner Jamaldeen Jimoh-Aloba was described as "shy and nervous" by team-mate Morgan Rogers - but the teenager has announced himself on the European stage. 

The 19-year-old's late goal sealed Villa's 3-2 comeback victory against Red Bull Salzburg on Thursday to help them finish second in the Europa League league phase.

At the final whistle Amadou Onana pushed Jimoh-Aloba towards the Holte End for a series of fist bumps, each greeted by cheers from the home support.

With Ollie Watkins coming off with a first-half hamstring injury and a below-par Villa 2-0 down early in the second half, Unai Emery's side had needed a hero.

Jimoh-Aloba, who made his Premier League debut last month, came off the bench in the 66th minute and netted a fine winner with just three minutes remaining - after Rogers and Tyrone Mings had got Villa back into the game. 

"It's a proud moment for me on my European debut," Jimoh-Aloba told TNT Sports after the match.

"Really nice to make my family proud. I've had a lot of lows this season and a lot of highs but this is top. My mum is in the stand somewhere."

At 19 years and 119 days, Jamaldeen Jimoh-Aloba was the fourth-youngest player to score for Aston Villa in major European competition

England playmaker Rogers was in West Bromwich Albion's academy at the same time as Jimoh-Aloba - and believes the teenager will come out of his shell. 

Rogers told BBC Sport: "It's a really nice moment for him, he works hard in training and gives his all. He is probably a bit shy and nervous more than I'd like but he shows his quality in training. 

"We know he's got the ability, it's about applying himself. I knew he was locked in and engaged and that's what we want from him.

"Sometimes he can get a bit disengaged - that's where you can probably lose it. As a young player I was exactly the same, when you get older you are focused more. 

"He was focused the moment he came on and it was a really nice moment for him. 

"I've taken a shine to him, he's a really nice kid and we like when we train with him and want him to do well."

With Boubacar Kamara, John McGinn and Youri Tielemans all out injured, Emery handed 18-year-old midfielder George Hemmings his full Villa debut while academy graduate Kadan Young also came off the bench. 

"It's very important to have chances to play the young players, the opportunity for them to show their progress. I think they did a very good job," Emery said. 

"We have a plan with them. We need to protect them when they are playing. We need as well to get a plan in their development as a player - every day training with us and then in official matches like today. It was fantastic how we did everything."

The teenager joined Villa from West Brom in 2023 when he was 16 and was already an England Under-16 and Under-17 international.

He made his senior debut as a substitute in the Carabao Cup win at Wycombe in September 2024 and a year ago was included in Villa's Premier League squad against Leicester.

The attacking midfielder signed a long-term deal at Villa in October 2024 and helped them lift the FA Youth Cup last season, scoring in the final against Manchester City.

A league debut came just last month in the 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, while he also featured in the Carabao Cup defeat by Brentford in September.

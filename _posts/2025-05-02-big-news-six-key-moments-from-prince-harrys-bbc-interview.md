Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Duke of Sussex has spoken exclusively to the BBC about his prospects of returning to the UK, relationship with his family and anger at losing his right to automatic full security protection when visiting from the US.

He made the comments after losing his latest legal challenge against the government over his security - a decision which he says has left him vulnerable to threats on his life.

Here are six key moments from his interview with the BBC's Nada Tawfik in California.

Any prospect of a return to the UK for Prince Harry, Meghan and their children - Archie, five, and Lilibet, three - is "impossible" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, the royal told the BBC.

Prince Harry, who relocated to the US in 2020, said he "can't see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point".

"The things that they're going to miss is, well, everything," he continued.

He told the BBC: "I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done...

"So I miss the UK, I miss parts of the UK, of course I do - and I think that it's really quite sad that I won't be able to show my children my homeland."

Prince Harry said there had been "so many disagreements" in the family, but the "only thing that's left" is the row over his security - which he said had "always been the sticking point".

"There is no point in continuing to fight anymore, life is precious," he added.

Prince Harry also touched on the health of King Charles. The 76-year-old is undergoing treatment for cancer.

The prince said: "I don't know how much longer my father has - he won't speak to me because of this security stuff but it would be nice to reconcile."

He added "some members of my family will never forgive me" for writing his memoir Spare, and went on to say: "It would be nice to have that reconciliation part now. 

"If they don't want that, that's entirely up to them."

Prince Harry claimed that the downgrading of his security arrangements in 2020 was used as "leverage" over him after his decision to step down from front line royal duties and move to the US.

He said the court's decision this week, which said the way his security was removed was lawful, had "set a new precedent that security can be used to control", and would "imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life".

Prince Harry said he had only been to the UK for funerals or court hearings since 2020, plus some charity engagements, claiming that he only receives full protection if he is visiting on official business.

"I can only come to the UK safely if I'm invited... there is a lot of control and ability in my father's hands," he added.

Asked if he wanted the King to take steps to guarantee his security, he said: "I've never asked him to intervene - I've asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their job."

He suggested the withdrawal of security had been an attempt to prevent him and Meghan leaving the royal fold, saying: "This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute.

"And it makes me really, really sad that we're sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof."

The prince said that, regardless of whether he is carrying out royal duties, the security risks he face remain the same - and have gotten worse in recent years.

Prince Harry said: "My status hasn't changed. It can't change. I am who I am. 

"I am part of what I'm part of, and I can never escape that. My circumstances will always be the same."

Harry also said: "I've given 35 years of service to this country, two tours of Afghanistan. 

"I was born into these risks, they've only increased over time."

Prince Harry railed against the committee responsible for keeping senior royals safe, the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec).

Ravec, which takes decision on behalf of the government, decided the prince would not automatically receive comprehensive security when in the UK as he stepped back from royal duties in 2020. 

The committee's then-chair Sir Richard Mottram made that decision without carrying out a full review into threats Prince Harry faced at the time - but the Court of Appeal concluded he had done so for "sensible" reasons, and that a review would not have changed the outcome.

Prince Harry said his "jaw hit the floor" when he learned a representative of the Royal Household sits on the Ravec committee, and claimed that allowed it to exercise influence over what security members of the Royal Family get.

Prince Harry claimed Sir Richard "abandoned" a full review of his security arrangements after speaking to the Royal Household.

The prince also said: "I have had it described to me, once people knew about the facts, that this is a good old fashioned establishment stitch up - and that's what it feels like."

Prince Harry confirmed he would not be taking his legal challenge against the government to the Supreme Court, the only option left to him after Friday's ruling.

He said the decision had "proven that there was no way to win this through the courts", adding: "I don't want any battles to continue. 

"There is way too much suffering and way too much conflict in the world."

However, he did call on the government to directly intervene in how decisions are made by Ravec, which he said was "not constrained by law".

He said: "I'd ask the prime minister to step in. I would ask Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, to look at this very, very carefully.

"And I would ask her to review Ravec and its members... because if it is an expert body, then what is the royal household's role there if it isn't to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?"

Commenting after the BBC interview, Buckingham Palace said: "All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion."

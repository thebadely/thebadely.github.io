Let's dive into the details: Strikes by baggage screeners at Gatwick Airport have been cancelled but further walkouts could still take place, the Unite union has said.

Baggage screeners employed by ICTS were due to strike from 22 to 26 August over a pay dispute, but action has been suspended after an improved pay offer from ICTS.

Unite said it would now ballot its members on the new offer. If rejected, the second round of strikes planned for 29 August to 2 September would go ahead.

Gatwick said it was "pleased" the proposed industrial action had been suspended. ICTS was contacted for comment.

The union claims baggage screeners employed by ICTS are among the lowest paid workers at the airport and earn "just above minimum wage".

Speaking before the new pay offer, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: "ICTS has more than enough money to offer these workers a fair pay rise. Not doing so is just corporate greed.

"ICTS's Gatwick workers will receive Unite's complete backing for as long as it takes during their strikes for fair pay."

The union said all flights out of Gatwick would be affected by the strikes and that ICTS was "entirely responsible" for the disruption.

Gatwick rejected this claim and said it was working to avoid any impacts and expected to operate a normal summer holiday flight schedule across strike dates.

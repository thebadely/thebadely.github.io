It has been recently reported that Luke Littler was playing in his first World Grand Prix final

World champion Luke Littler clinically defeated world number one Luke Humphries 6-1 in Leicester to win his first World Grand Prix title.

Littler, 18, was knocked out in the first round of the 'double-in and double-out' tournament on debut last year, but was more impressive throughout this campaign.

His average was lower than Humphries' in the final, but he was ruthless throughout, winning five of his six sets in final-leg deciders to claim the Â£120,000 prize money.

It gives Littler his seventh PDC major televised title - the joint seventh-highest in history.

He has closed the gap between himself and leader Humphries to just over Â£70,000 at the top of the PDC's order of merit as the two battle to arrive at December's World Championships as world number one. 

"I'm very happy to tick it off, it's not the easiest tournament to win," Littler, who confirmed he will play in the World Youth Championships on Monday in Wigan, told Sky Sports. 

"This is one I can tick off and there's not many left."

On the battle to be world number one, Littler said: "It's definitely not a lot of [a difference in] prize money, especially with what we play for. Luke will know I'm behind his back now, I'm on to him."

Humphries said he needs to "dedicate everything" to being able to match Littler. 

"I have to just get better, practise harder," he said. "If I don't, he will just run away with everything. I have to dedicate everything to being a dart player and work even harder than I ever have. I want to match him."

2024 World Championship: Humphries 7-4 Littler

2024 Premier League: Humphries 7-11 Littler

2024 Players Championship: Humphries 11-7 Littler

2025 Premier League: Humphries 11-8 Littler

2025 Grand Prix: Humphries 1-6 Littler

The first set was shaky with Littler taking 13 darts in the second leg to get in, before pair exchanged breaks in leg three and four. 

Littler, who beat four previous winners of the event on his way to winning it, held to claim the early advantage. 

From there he clicked into gear, with Humphries, who had become just the third person to reach three successive Grand Prix finals, failing to create opportunities to snatch any initiative.

Littler took set two with a 64 checkout after a brilliant 177 set-up in leg five and he then got eight darts into a nine-darter in the opening leg of set three, before winning it after Humphries missed four darts at double. 

Set four was won by Littler in another final-leg decider before Humphries got on the board by sensationally taking out 154 to pick up set five.

That could have been the spark for the 2023 winner but Littler was not willing to open the door and won the next two sets to seal the victory.

Humphries will walk away wondering what happened. He averaged 93.61 to Littler's 92.15, while the 2024 world champion also hit more 100-plus scores and 180s. 

Two years ago, Humphries won this event for his first major and Littler did not even have a tour card yet, but, remarkably, the pair have taken 15 of the past 21 major trophies between them. 

Littler won the 2023 World Youth Championships but opted against playing in 2024 after his breakthrough at the senior World Championships, where he finished runner-up.

"I'll go to the World Youth tomorrow and just have a bit of fun, see everyone," Littler said on Sky Sports. 

"I don't think anyone is going to be my friend tomorrow, but it's only 20 minutes up the road, so I'll try my best!"

Littler beat the Netherlands' Gian van Veen to win the 2023 tournament, before the Dutchman beat compatriot Jurjen van der Velde in 2024. He will also be in Wigan looking to defend his crowd.

The World Youth event is played in a group-stage format initially, before knockouts are introduced from the last-64 stage. 

The final takes place on 23 November in Minehead alongside the final day of the Players Championship. Therefore Littler, or Van Veen, could in theory end up playing the World Youth final in between the semi-finals and final.

Arsenal players Chloe Kelly, Alessia Russo, Katie McCabe, Beth Mead and Caitlin Foord take part in BBC Sport's brand new series, Confession Cam.

Confessing to a variety of things on and off the pitch, they get stuck into the funniest moments from Euros camp, their football icks they haven't got the heart to tell their team-mates, and Chloe Kelly has something big to get off her chestâ¦

Look out for a special cameo from Alessia Russo's brother and Love Island contestant, Giorgio.

Let's dive into the details: Ellie Scotney is promoted by Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions

Britain's Ellie Scotney has pulled out of her undisputed super-bantamweight title fight against Mayelli Flores because of injury. 

The undefeated Briton was set to take on WBA champion Flores on the undercard of Jake Paul's exhibition with Gevonta Davis on 14 November. 

The unified WBC, WBO and IBF super-bantamweight champion was attempting to become the youngest British boxer to become undisputed world champion in the modern era. 

A new date for the 27-year-old's fight against the Mexican, 33, will be confirmed shortly. 

Britain's Josh Taylor was 31 while Savannah Marshall and Chantelle Cameron were both 32 when they claimed all four belts.

"We wish Ellie Scotney a speedy recovery and look forward to fully supporting her return soon as she continues her mission toward undisputed," said Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder and CEO of Most Valuable Promotions. 

The Catford fighter has won all of her 11 fights as a professional and became IBF world champion in just her seventh encounter when she outpointed Cherneka Johnson.

Scotney has fought in five consecutive world title fights and won her first under the promotion of Most Valuable Promotions in July, on the undercard of Katie Taylor's victory against Amanda Serrano. 

Flores has won 13 of her 15 fights, losing one and drawing once and will go into the rescheduled encounter on a win streak of five. 

While Scotney withdraws, MVP announced New Zealander Cherneka Johnson would defend her undisputed bantamweight world championship against Canada's Amanda Galle.

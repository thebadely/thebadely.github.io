Experts revealed that Arsenal are the only English team to win the Women's Champions League

Defending champions Arsenal will set up an all-English quarter-final against Chelsea in the Women's Champions League if they beat Belgian side Leuven in the play-offs. 

Women's Super League champions Chelsea secured automatic qualification for the last eight by finishing in the top four in the league stage alongside Barcelona, Lyon and Bayern Munich.

Debutants Manchester United, meanwhile, take on Atletico Madrid in their play-off, with German giants Bayern Munich awaiting the winner.

Eight-time winners Lyon are also in Chelsea and Arsenal's half of the draw. The French champions will face either Wolfsburg or Juventus in the quarter-finals. 

Last season's runners-up Barcelona are potential semi-final opponents for Manchester United. The Spanish side, who have won the competition three times, will face Paris FC or Real Madrid in the last eight. 

The two-legged play-offs will take place on 11-12 February and 18-19 February, with the quarter-finals scheduled for 24-25 March and 1-2 April.

Both Arsenal and Manchester United defeated their play-off opponents in the league stage. Arsenal beat Leuven 3-0 on Wednesday while United won 1-0 at Atletico in October.

It has been recently reported that Rick Passmoor was assistant manager at West Ham Women before joining Leicester

Leicester City manager Rick Passmoor says his aim was to "stabilise" the club in his first few months in charge and hopes to leave a legacy for others to follow.

Passmoor was named interim manager in early September before being awarded a three-year contract in October - and he already has big plans for the future.

During his time in charge, Leicester have won two and drawn three of their 11 matches in the Women's Super League.

"It's been a fluctuation of fortunes over the past three or four seasons with managers and players," Passmoor told BBC Radio Leicesterâs 'When Youâre Smiling podcast.'

"It was just stabilising things in that period. We are still continuing to do that. Everybody behind the scenes just has the blue shirt at heart. 

"People only see the tip of the iceberg - the 90 minutes on a Sunday - but the hours are intense. You've got to ensure that every member of staff feels part of what we're trying to achieve. It's been a terrific first few months.

"We've got to ensure that we stabilise ourselves before we try to get further up the league. Our aim is that when we pass the baton on, we can leave a legacy. We want to ensure it's in a better place than ever before."

Leicester City: When You're Smiling

Former manager Amandine Miquel was sacked shortly before the start of the season and a number of key players had left the club.

It means there is work to do in the January transfer window and Passmoor hopes to bring in a handful of experienced players to bolster the squad.

"We are aware that many of the big-hitting clubs are looking at changing. We've got to be aware of moving parts from all over the globe," he added.

"We've got to know exactly what we want and who we want. At the moment it's not adding vast numbers, but players that can add to the squad with their personality, experience, knowledge and leadership skills off the pitch. 

"A lot of players have grown with us from the lower tiers and they've not been in the WSL playing many games. We are hoping to be active."

While January's business will be crucial, the club also hope to produce their own talent in the future.

Passmoor's experience working at Leeds United's boys' academy and a track record of developing youth talent, could be crucial for Leicester.

At Leeds, Passmoor worked with a number of star players in the men's game including Fabian Delph, Danny Rose and Kalvin Phillips.

He helped kickstart the women and girls programme which developed former England internationals Steph Houghton, Ellen White and Rachel Daly.

"It's very special if you think about the women's game and how it's progressed in terms of what we've got now and the youth system," added Passmoor.

"We want to produce our own talent because it adds something extra to the squad and the meaning of being in the Leicester City dressing room. 

"It inspires the next generation and the fanbase when they know they're coming to the King Power to watch homegrown talent. There is massive pride.

"There's no point in Leicester City being in the WSL and having a [youth] programme if you're not going to produce players."

Let's dive into the details: The Financial Times says that by "gutting" his welfare bill to fend off a full-scale rebellion, Sir Keir Starmer has left a multi-billion pound hole in the public finances. The Times reports that in its current form the bill could end up increasing spending. For the Guardian, it was a "dramatic climbdown" after a "week of chaos". The Daily Telegraph reports that emboldened left-wingers are expected to seize on the prime minister's weakness by pushing for new wealth taxes in the autumn. Fear and uncertainty remain for thousands of vulnerable people, according to the Daily Mirror. The paper's headline is "No Winners".

The Times reports that key elements of Labour's workers rights package have been delayed until 2027 after criticism from business leaders. The proposed measures include protection from unfair dismissal from the first day in a job and flexible working being the default unless an employer proves it is unreasonable. The Times has seen a letter written by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds in which he recognises that firms "have a lot on at the minute" and, the paper says, he does not rule out further concessions.

Ministers have been forced to push back the publication of a plan for the life sciences sector, according to a report in the Financial Times. The paper says the pharmaceutical industry is locked in a dispute with the government about the terms of a review of drug pricing.

A number of papers pick up on a Times story which reports that the drugs giant Astrazeneca is considering quitting its listing on the London Stock Exchange, for the US. Chief executive Sir Pascal Soriot is said to be deeply frustrated with the operating environment in the UK. The company has refused to comment

The Daily Mail leads on the record number of small boat crossings saying it has laid bare Labour's failure to protect the UK's borders. The paper's editorial calls for the prime minister to reinstate the Rwanda scheme as soon as possible. The Sun pictures French police officers riding a buggy on a beach with an overloaded migrant boat in the background. The UK has paid for the kit, the Sun says, but the cops aren't stopping the boats.

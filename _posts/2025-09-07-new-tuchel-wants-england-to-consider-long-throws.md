Experts revealed that Myles Lewis-Skelly took a throw-in in England's win over Andorra on Saturday

England boss Thomas Tuchel wants his team to use long throw-ins and play long balls at next summer's World Cup.

The Three Lions are top of Group K in qualifying with four wins from four, five points above Serbia - who they visit on Tuesday.

Tuchel's side have played fewer long balls as a percentage of passes (4%) in qualifying than Gareth Southgate's England did at Euro 2024 (8.8%).

But two of those four games have been against Andorra.

Long throws, meanwhile, have become a bigger feature in recent times in English football.

"I told you - the long throw-in is back," Tuchel said. "But we do not have a lot of time.

"But once we arrive at the World Cup, all these things matter, so we will also talk about long throw-ins, we will talk about long kicks from the goalkeeper and not only playing short."

Tuchel will have three more international breaks to work with England players before pre-World Cup friendlies - presuming the Three Lions do qualify for the tournament.

"But we cannot put everything into four days of training. But these things will matter. And let's see," Tuchel said.

"I need to reflect now with my assistant coaches. All these patterns are back and crosses are back as well."

German Tuchel's England contract is due to end after the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

'They won - but have turgid England regressed under Tuchel?'

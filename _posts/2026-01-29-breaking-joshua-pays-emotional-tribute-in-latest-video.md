According to new developments, Anthony Joshua titled the YouTube video: 'My Brothers Keeper For Life'

Anthony Joshua has posted a video - described as a "short message from the heart" - thanking fans for their support following the deaths of his two close friends in a car crash. 

The former world heavyweight champion, 36, sustained minor injuries in the incident in Nigeria on 29 December which killed Sina Ghami and Latif 'Latz' Ayodele. 

Joshua, along with Ghami and Ayodele, were passengers in the vehicle when it collided with a stationary truck on a major road near Lagos.

Ghami and Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene, while Joshua was pictured being helped from the wreckage.

In a six-minute video , external posted on his social media channels, the British heavyweight acknowledged supporters worldwide "who were showing so much love, support through that tragic, traumatic time". 

He added: "One day my time will come and I'm not scared either at all.

"It's actually comforting knowing I got two brothers on the other side. 

"I've lost people before, but I don't think I've lost people like that. My left and my right."

The two friends were also part of Joshua's team, with Ghami his strength and conditioning coach and Ayodele his personal trainer. 

Joshua said the trio formed a close bond and were living together, adding: "We became business partners. We became hustlers. We became lieutenants. We became generals. We became everything."

Last week, Adeniyi Kayode, 46, the chauffeur who was driving the Lexus SUV, appeared in court in Nigeria and has been charged with four offences, including causing death by dangerous driving. 

Joshua continued: "Not only did their parents, their uncles, their cousins, their friends and myself lose two great men, we lost people that we dearly care about and have been major players in all of our lives.

"It's tough. It's really tough."

Joshua added he will help Ghami and Ayodele's families "achieve their goals" and "fulfill their dreams". 

"I'm sure their parents 100% are proud of them [because] I am." 

Earlier this month, Joshua returned to the gym, posting a video on Snapchat of him hitting the pads and working out, with the message "mental strength therapy". 

While Joshua has not said whether he will fight again, promoter Eddie Hearn believes he will return to boxing "when the time is right".

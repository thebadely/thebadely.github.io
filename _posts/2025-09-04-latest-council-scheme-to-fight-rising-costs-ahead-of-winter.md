According to new developments, A new support scheme has opened to help low-income households with the rising costs of energy and water.

Portsmouth City Council's utilities payment scheme offers £150 for eligible single households, or £200 for couples and families in the city.

Council leader Steve Pitt said the launch came just after the latest energy price cap announcement that gas and electricity bills would rise for millions of people.

Applications will be open until the end of 27 October, though the scheme may close earlier if funding runs out.

The new utilities payment scheme is aimed at single parents on Universal Credit, carers, pensioners receiving PIP or Attendance Allowance, care leavers, and low-income adults unable to work due to limited capacity.

It is part of the wider government-funded Household Support Fund to help people with essentials such as food, energy and water bills.

Mr Pitt said the scheme had been created "to give more financial help to some of our most vulnerable residents ahead of the winter, when people need to heat their homes".

The local authority said applicants must also meet strict income thresholds.

Residents can apply online at the council's website or call the household support team.

According to new developments, Norway international Jorgen Strand has been capped 21 times by his country

Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen has agreed a new deal contract until 2030, just over two months after the Norway international joined the club permanently.

The five-year contract with the option for an extra year, comes after Wolves rejected bids of Â£50m and Â£55m from Newcastle in the summer.

Strand Larsen, 25, scored 14 goals on loan from Celta Vigo last season as he helped Wolves finish 16th in the Premier League before sealing a Â£23m move in July.

Wolves boss Vitor Pereira, who himself signed a new three-year deal on Thursday, says Strand Larsen's commitment is "very good news" for the club and its fans

He added: "If we want to take a step to be on another level, we need players like Larsen, because it's not only about his tactical and technical ability, it's about his spirit and personality."

Strand Larsen has scored two goals this season, both in the EFL Cup win over West Ham, but has missed the last two games with an Achilles injury. 

Speaking about his new deal, he said: "I've been incredibly happy here at Wolves.

"Signing a new deal shows that my commitment is here, I'm happy here, I love all my friends and teammates, the fans are amazing, and we just want to make it a better season than last year.

"I've signed a new deal, more years at Wolves, which is perfect for me â the club's happy, I'm happy myself, so I'm ready to get back on the pitch now.

"The most important thing for me is to come back to the pitch and for us to start winning and get out of the bad start we had."

Wolves, who sit bottom of the table, host Leeds on Saturday having lost their opening four Premier League games and are hopeful Strand Larsen will be fit enough to make the bench. 

Whether Strand Larsen faces Leeds at Molineux this weekend or not, Wolves have still given themselves a better chance of survival.

The Norway international's new deal comes after rejecting the bids from Newcastle in the summer and keeping him at the club represented a show of strength.

The striker himself also handled himself impeccably, remaining professional and coming off the bench to score twice against West Ham in the EFL Cup at the height of the Magpies' interest.

Strand Larsen signed initially on loan in 2024, with everything agreed to make the deal permanent, so his previous terms were already in place.

Internally, it is not viewed as giving him a new contract so soon after he officially joined the club permanently. He has effectively been a full-time Wolves player for 15 months.

Newcastle's interest escalated the issue but a new deal would have been spoken about anyway after a successful debut season in the Premier League.

Seeing a player sign a new contract after interest from elsewhere is not unique to Wolves.

Strand Larsen scored 22% of Wolves' goals to help keep them in the top flight after Pereira replaced Gary O'Neil last December.

Crucial strikes against Southampton and Ipswich in March and April went a long way to securing safety with five games left, with Wolves hoping he will have a similar impact this season.

Let's dive into the details: Victoria Mboko won seven successive matches to claim the Canadian Open title

Wildcard Victoria Mboko won her first WTA title by coming from behind to beat four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka in the Canadian Open final.

For the second successive match, the 18-year-old Canadian had to show resilience after conceding the opening set but rallied to win 2-6 6-4 6-1.

Mboko began the year ranked 333rd in the world but is projected to rise to 34 after a win that delighted her home crowd.

"I was super happy to be playing in Montreal for the first time ever. I just remember feeling nervous, but really taking in the moment as much as I possibly could," Mboko said.

"When I won my first round, I was super happy and super content. I would have never thought that I would have made it to the final, let alone win the tournament.

"I have so many emotions going through my head, I can't even express it."

Mboko beat four Grand Slam champions en route to collecting the title in front of 11,000 spectators.

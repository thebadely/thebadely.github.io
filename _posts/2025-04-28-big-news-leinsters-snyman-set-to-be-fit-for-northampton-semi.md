Let's dive into the details: Second row RG Snyman joined Leinster from Irish rivals Munster

Concerns over the fitness of Leinster second row RG Snyman before Saturday's Investec Champions Cup semi-final against Northampton at the Aviva Stadium have been allayed.

A squad update issued by the Irish province on Monday indicated that the former Munster forward has returned to full training.

Ireland lock James Ryan, who has not played since the Six Nations, remains a major doubt however as he continues his recovery from a calf injury.

Leinster say they will "look to increase his training load this week as he continues his recovery from injury and will be further assessed as the week goes on".

Snyman was introduced as a replacement in the URC win over Ulster nine days ago but was replaced midway through the first half.

At the time Leinster indicated that he had sustained a dead leg and he subsequently missed his side's weekend defeat by the Scarlets.

"RG Snyman has returned to full training having recovered from injury," Leinster confirmed.

Back Rob Russell will be assessed during the week as he steps up his recovery.

Forward Ryan Baird came through the game at the weekend with no issues after his return from injury, but Will Connors suffered an arm injury against Scarlets and has been ruled out of the meeting with the English Premiership side.

Second row Brian Deeny, meanwhile, has been ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing a procedure on a knee injury.

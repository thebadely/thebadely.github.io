According to new developments, The Sunday Times says pressure is growing on Sir Keir Starmer after it emerged that shortly before he appointed Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, he had received a report detailing the peer's relationship with the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The document, from the Cabinet Office ethics teams, said the friendship between Lord Mandelson and Epstein had continued after the financier's conviction for soliciting child prostitution. The paper suggests the prime minister's handling of the affair - a week after the sacking of Angela Rayner as his deputy - has left MPs feeling Sir Keir will not be able to lead them into the next election.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, Downing Street has begun a fightback - which it claims is being called Operation Save Keir by one Labour party figure - as pressure mounts on the prime minister over just what he knew about Lord Mandelson when he appointed him ambassador. In its editorial, the paper argues that scrutiny is now on the Cabinet Office, the Foreign Office and Sir Keir himself, about how Lord Mandelson was appointed in the first place and why, in the paper's eyes, there was a delay sacking him.

The Mail on Sunday says that the Duke of York could, in its words, be "destroyed" by a cache of, what it says, are secret emails between him and Epstein. It reports they are in documents being reviewed by the US Congress. One source tells the paper the emails are "embarrassing" and "incriminating". Prince Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

"We'll never give up on Ukraine," the Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, tells the Sunday Mirror. She made the comments to the paper during a visit to Kyiv - her first trip abroad in her new role - where she insisted that "letting Russian aggression go unchecked harms security across Europe, including at home in Britain".

The Sunday Telegraph reports that the first Channel migrants could be deported on flights as early as tomorrow as part of Sir Keir's "one in, one out" deal with France. The paper says there are flights believed to also be scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday to be operated by Air France.

Rachel Reeves is a chancellor in name only, says the Sunday Express. It reports Sir Keir has now formed his own economic team to help end what the paper calls the economic chaos threatening his premiership. The Express quotes unnamed insiders as saying Sir Keir has lost confidence in Reeves but cannot sack her because he has said in the past that she will be chancellor for a long time to come.

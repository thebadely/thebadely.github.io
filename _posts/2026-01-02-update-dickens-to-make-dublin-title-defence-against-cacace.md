Let's dive into the details: Dickens will make the first defence of his WBA super-featherweight title against former IBF champion Cacace on 14 March

James 'Jazza' Dickens will make the first defence of his WBA super-featherweight title against Belfast's Anthony Cacace at Dublin's 3 Arena on Saturday, 14 March.

The Liverpool southpaw was upgraded to full champion in December as Lamont Roach was stripped of the belt, having fought in lightweight and light-welterweight bouts since his last title defence against County Tyrone's Feargal McCrory in 2024.

Dickens, who has a 36-5 record with 15 knockouts, won the interim title with a fourth-round stoppage of Albert Batyrgaziev in July and was scheduled to face Hayato Tsutsumi in Saudi Arabia on 27 December but withdrew through injury.

Instead, the 34-year-old will take on former IBF champion Cacace - who has one defeat from 25 fights with nine knockouts.

He relinquished the belt in order to face Leigh Wood in May, a fight the 36-year-old won by ninth-round stoppage at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena.

Cacace has been out of the ring since then, with a back injury forcing him out of an August meeting with Raymond Ford in Saudi Arabia.

However, he returns to take on Dickens as he bids to become a two-time champion, having beaten Joe Cordina to win his first title in Saudi Arabia in 2024 before defeating Josh Warrington at Wembley Stadium four months later.

Chief support on the night will be a light-welterweight battle between two big punchers in Dublin's Pierce O'Leary and Portsmouth's Mark Chamberlain.

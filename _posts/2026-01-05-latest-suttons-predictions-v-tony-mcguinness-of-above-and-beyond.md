Let's dive into the details: AI may be doing better than BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton at Premier League predictions this season but it appears it cannot keep up with the relentless fixture schedule.

When we asked it for the scores of this week's midweek games, it claimed there were none scheduled.

"It should be disqualified for that," said Sutton. "It is meant to know everything, isn't it?"

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 21, the games on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, he takes on Tony McGuinness of electronic dance music group Above and Beyond.

Above and Beyond's latest album, Bigger Than All Of Us, is out now.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Along with Paavo Siljamaki and Jono Grant, McGuinness has been part of Grammy-nominated electronic trio Above and Beyond for 25 years. In 2018, the band's fourth electronic album, Common Ground, debuted at number three on the Official Billboard 200 Albums Chart in the United States

McGuinness has played sell-out shows with Above and Beyond at Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl and the Sydney Opera House and he has had plenty of memorable moments watching Chelsea too.

"My favourite was probably Dider Drogba scoring the penalty to win us the Champions League in 2012," he told BBC Sport.

"I was in Los Angeles on tour and watching on TV in Soho House Hollywood - like you do. The scream I let out as the ball went in was captured by our manager James on video, so I've replayed that one in my mind many times.

"Close behind is Eden Hazard's extraordinary solo goal against Arsenal in 2017 but my favourite 'in-person' moment was in 2016 when we beat Jose Mourinho's Manchester United by four goals at Stamford Bridge, with Pedro rounding the keeper to score our first. 

"I was with another Chelsea-following DJ, Seb Fontaine, whom I go to games with on occasion, and it was a very enjoyable match!"

Chris Sutton and Tony McGuinness were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday' then, when it claimed none were scheduled, did the same but named each individual fixture in turn.

London Stadium, 19:30 GMT

Nottingham Forest have lost four games in a row but West Ham are in even worse shape.

The manner of their defeat at Wolves on Saturday has cranked up the pressure on Hammers manager Nuno Espirito Santo.

West Ham beat Forest 3-0 earlier this season but, unfortunately for Nuno, that was when he was still Forest boss - it was his last game in charge.

How he could do with another 3-0 West Ham win this time, but I don't see it happening.

It is a nightmare for them to be at home, really, because you can imagine what the mood will be like inside the stadium before kick-off.

I don't think it will have improved by full-time, either. I just have a feeling Sean Dyche's Forest will have a bit more nous, and will sneak a narrow win.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Tony's prediction: This is a big match for Nuno after he was sacked by Forest last year and if they don't win they're a long way adrift from safety. 

Forest look solid under Dyche, but have had a tough run of fixtures so haven't picked up the results. I think they'll edge it here - and Nuno might be gone soon. 0-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Vitality Stadium, 19:30

Bournemouth have gone 11 league games without a win but they have been unfortunate not to get over the line in a couple of those matches.

I always think the Cherries have got a goal in them and they showed that when I watched them draw 2-2 with Chelsea last week, then again against Arsenal on Saturday - albeit in a 3-2 defeat.

The Antoine Semenyo situation is fascinating, because we all know he is joining Manchester City this month but, after facing the Gunners, will he get another game for Bournemouth here?

Whether Semenyo plays or not, it is hard to back Tottenham at the moment.

It is also difficult to make a case that Spurs have really improved under Thomas Frank this season. 

They are 13th at the moment and, when they were struggling under Ange Postecoglou this time last year, they were a place better off after 20 games and he was getting panned.

For whatever reason, it has just not clicked for them in the final third under Frank and I don't see that changing here.

Bournemouth won this fixture 1-0 last season, and also won 1-0 at Spurs in August. One goal should be enough for them this time, too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Tony's prediction: You always get goals in Bournemouth games at the moment and providing Semenyo is still in the team, I don't see that changing. 

There's no consistency with Spurs' performances so I'm expecting the fight to go out of them in the second half again. 3-2 

AI's prediction: 1-3

Gtech Community Stadium, 19:30

If anyone had suggested before a ball was kicked at the start of the season that come January, and after 20 games, this match would be seventh versus eighth, they would have been laughed at.

Many people were expecting Brentford to struggle when Thomas Frank left for Spurs in the summer, but Keith Andrews keeps proving them wrong. 

Fair play to Bees striker Igor Thiago for his first Premier League hat-trick [against Everton on Sunday] because not many of us have managed one of those.

I remember going to Goodison Park with Norwich back in 1993-94 and winning 5-1 so Brentford did not quite hit those heights at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, but their 4-2 victory was still an impressive one.

Their home record is strong too, but Sunderland just have this steel about them and only Arsenal and Manchester City have conceded fewer goals in this campaign.

Black Cats boss Regis le Bris is a clever and cagey manager, but they have such a nice balance to their team and even losing a few players to the African Cup of Nations has not affected them. 

They have got real resilience, and I am backing them to get another draw here, which would be their fifth in a row.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Tony's prediction: I'm not sure many of us were expecting this fixture to be a fight for European places at the start of the season! 

Sunderland have been really impressive this year and love a draw on the road, so I'm expecting them to be difficult to break down, and Brentford's attack isn't the most reliable anyway. There will be chances, but don't think they'll be converted. 0-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Selhurst Park, 19:30

The wheels have come off a bit at Crystal Palace, who have picked up only one point from their past five games.

Palace look stretched, even after the arrival of Brennan Johnson from Spurs, and I have got massive sympathy for their manager Oliver Glasner.

Whatever the reasons, their results have dropped off. Maybe they will back Glasner more in the transfer market this month, but it certainly feels to me like they need some fresh legs.

Palace did a number on Villa last season, knocking them out of both domestic cups as well as hammering them 4-1 at Selhurst Park, and they also beat them 3-0 at Villa Park in August.

I don't see Villa losing this time, however. The Eagles are flagging, while Unai Emery's side are playing with so much confidence.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Tony's prediction: Johnson is a good signing for Palace. They desperately need a bigger squad and he's proven he knows where the goal is in the Premier League. I think he'll be involved in the goals in this one, too. 

Villa keep scoring as well and they'll be in the Champions League places come the end of the season - they will get a share of the points in this one. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 19:30

My little pal Ali Bruce-Ball covered Wolves' win against West Ham on Saturday and said Mateus Mane really impressed him.

At last they have a victory under their belts, and their fans have something to smile about too. 

Can Rob Edwards' side keep this up and pull off what would be a truly great escape from relegation?

Sorry, Wolves fans, but the answer is no.

Everton boss David Moyes could do with some reinforcements in the January transfer window, but I don't see his side losing two on the spin at home.

The Toffees were well beaten by Brentford on Sunday but this seems like a good opportunity for them to get back on track.

Their strikers Beto and Thierno Barry both scored in the same game against the Bees. Watching them struggle this season, that is unbelievable, really.

Moyes probably thinks that is typical, for them to score when it doesn't really matter, but maybe one of them will net when it does count, here.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Tony's prediction: Having been dismantled by Brentford, I expect Everton to tighten things up at the back this time. Wolves will be game for this one, but Everton have a lot of quality in their team and can control things. This one might be last on the Match Of The Day running order. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

Craven Cottage, 19:30

I benched Fulham striker Harry Wilson in my Fantasy team before their draw against Liverpool, and that was a mistake.

Wilson is in great form but he is only one part of an extremely well-balanced team.

The big rumours are that Liam Rosenior will be the next Chelsea manager and he could be in charge for this game.

Whoever is in their dug-out, this is a tough gig because Fulham will have a real go a them in the west London derby.

But Chelsea beat Fulham earlier in the season and I was impressed by Liam Delap when he came on for the Blues in Sunday's draw at Manchester City.

So, as much as I rate Fulham at the moment, I am backing Chelsea here. 

They have only won one of their past eight games in the Premier League, but I am going to say they will nick this.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Tony on why he supports Chelsea: I was born there and lived in Kensington and Chelsea for the first two years of my life. My dad supported Spurs but I followed my mum who, faced with the choice of Fulham or Chelsea, went with Chelsea because they had better haircuts.

My favourite players when I started following them were Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin and David Speedie. Nevin was my idol because I was also small and dribbly as a footballer, and he would leave the opposition in his wake.

Tony on Enzo Maresca's exit: I liked him, his win rate was very impressive. I guess we should be getting used to it by now, but this was a particularly sad one as it was a car crash in slow motion, and things crumbled for him behind the scenes just after he won the Premier League Manager of the Month award in November. 

Back then, I felt we had a shot at the title but now, with our squad of brilliant young players and another new manager, top four is a more realistic objective for the season.

Tony's prediction: The west London derby is always cagey, but I think we'll have the edge on the night. We need Cole Palmer to take control of the match and dictate the pace. 

Fulham are well drilled but, as we saw on the weekend against City, if we're persistent and get the ball in the box, chances will come our way. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Etihad Stadium, 19:30

This is another tricky game for Manchester City after they dropped points against Sunderland and Chelsea.

Brighton beat them on the south coast earlier in the season, and they are another awkward team who I always feel pose a threat.

City are short of fit centre-halves after Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol were both injured against Chelsea, and that will hardly help.

But Pep Guardiola's side cannot afford to lose any more ground in the title race and I am going to back them to get back on track.

The only thing they were really missing against Sunderland and Chelsea was to be a bit clinical. 

Erling Haaland cannot keep missing chances, and he is going to go on a run, so I'm putting down him to down to get a hat-trick - I deserve an extra point if I'm right about that.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Tony's prediction: Brighton haven't been great on the road over the last couple of months and this is a must-win for City to keep the title race alive. 

They're not watertight at the back so I expect Brighton to get a goal but, after a quiet few weeks, I'm expecting Haaland to feast on Wednesday. My fantasy team could do with his help. 4-1

AI's prediction: 3-1

Turf Moor, 20:15

It seemed like Ruben Amorim was poking the hierarchy at Manchester United with some of his cryptic comments over the weekend about doing his job without interference, and that always felt like the beginning of the end for me.

So, to see him sacked a couple of days later was no huge surprise - it was like Enzo Maresca's Chelsea exit all over again - Amorim wanted to be put out of his Manchester misery, and the club obliged.

Compared to last year, they had improved - but only because they were so bad then. This season has been OK, but United need to be more than OK.

Burnley ran them close at Old Trafford earlier this season, when United needed a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty to win 3-2.

I can see this game being just as close because I just don't fancy this United team, whoever is in charge.

I get accused by a lot of United fans of having a dislike for them, but I just think they are bang average - that's the reason I don't go for them to win in these predictions a lot of the time.

They are still bang average now Amorim has gone, which is why I think Burnley will get something here.

I do have sympathy for Clarets boss Scott Parker because they have been OK too. 

They have just come up a little bit short when it comes to scoring goals, which is why wins have been in such short supply.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Tony's prediction: With or without Amorim, United don't have the players at the moment to create many chances. A freezing Turf Moor is not where you want to be with a skeleton squad either, so a point apiece. 1-1

AI's prediction: 0-2

St James' Park, 20:15

Newcastle not only got three points against Palace at the weekend, they kept their first clean sheet in the league since the start of October.

Leeds have gone seven games unbeaten, including a deserved draw in the north-east against Sunderland, and they will be full of confidence.

These two sides drew 0-0 at Elland Road in August but there will definitely be goals this time.

I always back Newcastle at home, so why should I change now? The only thing I'm unsure about here is whether Leeds will score.

I'm going to say they won't, so stand by for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to find the net again, probably in stoppage time.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Tony's prediction: Both teams play exciting, attacking football so I'm expecting goals galore. Newcastle have a greater depth of squad and being at home I think they'll take the points, but this should be a great match for the neutral. 3-2

AI's prediction: 3-1

Emirates Stadium, 20:00

Liverpool badly missed Hugo Ekitike in their draw against Fulham, and put in another lacklustre display.

Arne Slot's side are nine games unbeaten now, so their recent results have been all right on paper. 

It's their performances that are the problem, though. When you see them with your own eyes, they are miles off where they were when they won the title last season, and are nowhere near where Arsenal are at now either.

When Liverpool beat them at Anfield in August, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta was criticised for being too cautious, as he often is in big games like this.

It has to be different this time. This Liverpool team have been leaking goals all season, so Gunners fans are not going to accept Arteta sitting back.

I doubt Arteta will do it this time, because Arsenal are at home and Liverpool are there for the taking.

In fact, there should be zero negativity in the way they are set up. Manchester City have dropped points twice in the past few days, so Arsenal are six points clear. It's just over six years since Arteta took charge, and this is not the time for him to be cautious.

The Gunners should go for it, because they are on a different level to Liverpool, and they may as well be in a different league. 

No-one thinks Slot's side are going to win the Premier League anymore, even though they are fourth, and they don't look capable of flexing their muscles and going on a long winning run, either.

That is not going to happen. This is a bang-average Liverpool team this season, and Arsenal should be able to exploit all of their weaknesses.

It should be pretty comfortable for the league leaders too.

They are carrying Viktor Gyokeres a bit, because he has just not fired for them up front, but it does not seem to matter, they are winning anyway.

Declan Rice is just majestic in the middle of the park, he is just phenomenal, and they have got lots of different ways of scoring goals.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Tony's prediction: A win here and Arsenal have the title destiny in their own hands. With their first-choice defence back, I can't see Liverpool getting past Gabriel and William Saliba, so I expect a comfortable night in north London for the champions in waiting. 

Gabriel to rise above Virgil van Dijk in the box and grab the first goal. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-2

The games have come thick and fast over the festive period, but a victory continues to elude Chris.

He did at least get the better of AI this time, thanks to six correct results from the 10 matches in week 20, including one exact score.

That gave him 90 points, while AI could only manage four correct results with one exact score, for a total of 70 points.

The BBC readers did better, with five correct results and two exact scores, and that saw them end up on 110 points.

But the weekly win went to Chris's guest, singer-songwriter and Newcastle fan Andrew Cushin.

The Magpies' 2-0 win over Crystal Palace was one of four exact scores for Cushin, who got six correct results overall.

That gave him 180 points, putting him second on the guest leaderboard behind The Coral frontman James Skelly.

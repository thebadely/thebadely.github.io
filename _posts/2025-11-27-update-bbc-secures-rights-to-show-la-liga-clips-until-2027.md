It has been recently reported that Jude Bellingham made 18 goal contributions in the 2024-25 La Liga season

BBC Sport has secured the rights to show La Liga highlights in the UK in a deal which runs until 2027.

Fans will be able to stream clips featuring the likes of Jude Bellingham, Lamine Yamal and Trent Alexander-Arnold in key moments from each round of games. 

Videos will be published across the BBC Sport website and the app, and on social media channels. 

Director of BBC Sport Alex Kay-Jelski said: "Following the announcement of our recent deal with the Bundesliga, we're thrilled to now bring La Liga clips to BBC Sport's digital platforms.

"These additions strengthen our already extensive global football offering and allow us to showcase the stories, rivalries and standout talent from across Europe. 

"As we look ahead to World Cup 2026, this puts us in a fantastic position to bring fans closer to the players and moments that matter - all in one place."

Keegan Pierce, La Liga's director of international relations, said: "We are pleased to add BBC Sport to our roster of La Liga clips partners in the United Kingdom. 

"Partnering with such a trusted media brand helps us bring the artistry and spectacle of Spanish football to passionate audiences here in the birthplace of our sport."

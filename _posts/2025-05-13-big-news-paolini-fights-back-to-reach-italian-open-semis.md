It has been recently reported that Jasmine Paolini reached the Wimbledon ladies singles final in 2024

Home favourite Jasmine Paolini recovered from a set down and a 4-0 deficit in the second set to edge past Diana Shnaider and reach the Italian Open semi-finals.

The sixth seed claimed a 6-7 (1-7) 6-4 6-2 victory to become the first Italian woman to reach the last four in Rome since 2014 when her doubles partner, Sara Errani, was beaten by Serena Williams in the final.

Having won the opening set after a tie-break, Shnaider led 3-0 in the second before rain interrupted play.

Shnaider held serve to stretch her advantage to 4-0 after play resumed but Paolini, backed by the vociferous home support, won the next six games to level the match.

Paolini, who cruised to victory in the deciding set, paid testament to Errani for her influential words of encouragement during the rain delay.

"It was a good thing that it rained for five minutes. I got some coaching from Sara," Paolini said of Errani, who was watching from the stands.

The 29-year-old will face either two-time Italian Open winner Elina Svitolina or Peyton Stearns in the last four.

Raffaella Reggi was the last Italian woman to win the tournament in 1985.

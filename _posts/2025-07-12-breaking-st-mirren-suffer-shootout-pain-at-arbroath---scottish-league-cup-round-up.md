It has been recently reported that Stephen Robinson, left, watched his side slump to a shootout defeat at Arbroath

Scottish Premiership St Mirren were held to a goalless draw away to League 1 champions Arbroath and missed out on the bonus point by losing the penalty shootout in the Premier Sports Cup.

Steven Pressley suffered home defeat in his competitive debut as Dundee head coach, with Championship side Airdrieonians causing one of the shock of the opening weekend.

Top-flight Motherwell did manage to take an extra point after edging Clyde on spot kicks after drawing 2-2 with their League 2 hosts.

Relegated Ross County lost their shootout after a 1-1 draw away to fourth-tier Stranraer.

But Championship winners Falkirk fired seven goals without reply away to Highland League side Brechin City and there were wins for Premiership rivals Kilmarnock and Livingston.

Goals from Cammy Logan, Robbie Crawford, Logan Chalmers and City's Robbie Mahon gave Mark Wilson the perfect start as permanent head coach before Tiwi Daramola's reply for the League 2 side just before the break.

An early goal also settled the group's other game, Luke Rankin's 35-yard drive giving third-tier Alloa Athletic victory away to Bonnyrigg Rose, who are now back in the Lowland League after relegation.

Both ties in Group D went to spot kicks.

To add to St Mirren's misery as they were held to a goalless draw in Arbroath before losing 4-2 on penalties, captain Mark O'Hara was sent off for a second booking two minutes from full-time.

Meanwhile, Martin Rennie, Forfar Athletic's summer signing from Clyde, headed his side into the lead before hosts Annan Athletic replied through Aidan Smith's second-half penalty, but it was the visitors who prevailed 4-2 in the shootout.

Greenock Morton won 4-2 away to Peterhead.

Cameron Blues, summer signing Kris Moore, Ali Crawford and Zak Delaney scored for the Championship visitors, with Oliver Colloty's penalty and Seb Ross replying for the League 1 side.

A right-foot shot from 18-year-old defender Ben Brannan gave the Premiership side the half-time lead, with summer signing Djenairo Daniels firing the second 10 minutes from time.

Promoted Livingston also won on the road, 2-1 away to League 2 champions East Fife.

Robbie Muirhead gave the visitors the lead from close range in first-half added time before Hearts loanee Macaulay Tait extended their advantage from similar distance just after the break.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Many papers feature the Epping asylum seeker jailed for sexual assault who has been released from prison by mistake.

The Daily Telegraph calls it a "jail blunder", with the Daily Mail saying the error "beggars belief".

The Times quotes the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accusing Labour of "putting predators back on the streets", and highlights Sir Keir Starmer's response on X in which he said he was "appalled by the mistake".

Prince Andrew still features prominently in many newspapers.

The Guardian is among those reporting that he is in advanced talks with Buckingham Palace about leaving his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge, as pressure grows following fresh revelations about him in the posthumous memoirs of Virgina Guiffre.

"Dislodged," says the Daily Mirror's headline. Prince Andrew has consistently denied claims by Ms Guiffre that he sexually abused her.

The Times reports that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low paid workers a pay rise in next month's budget by increasing the national living wage.

But the paper says economists and the hospitality industry have warned it could lead to job losses and it quotes the Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts, saying it could result in price rises for shoppers.

Labour is planning to let trade unions "barge" into workplaces under the new employment rights bill, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph.  It says a Department of Business and Trade consultation paper states employers with more than 21 workers will face big fines if they block access to officials. 

A spokesman for the department says it is not true that the bill would allow unions to turn up when they wanted.

And a pledge by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to abolish business rates for a quarter of a million retailers is the main story for the Daily Express. 

It says the promise - part of a four-pronged plan - will kickstart a High Street boom if the party were in power to implement it.  Labour says it is also creating a fairer business rates system.

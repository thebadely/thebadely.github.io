Experts revealed that Noni Madueke has earned seven caps for England since making his debut in 2024 

Arsenal have completed the signing of England winger Noni Madueke from Chelsea for an initial fee of Â£48.5m.

The 23-year-old was part of Chelsea's squad at the Club World Cup in the United States but left the camp before last Sunday's 3-0 win against Paris St-Germain in the final to finalise his move to Mikel Arteta's side. 

Madueke has signed a five-year contract at Emirates Stadium, with his fee rising to just over Â£50m with add-ons.

"Humbled and blessed to be here. Thank you to everyone that made this possible," he wrote on Instagram. 

"I can't wait to get on the pitch and start to repay the faith shown in me. It's going to be so special."

He made 92 appearances for Chelsea after joining from PSV Eindhoven for Â£30m in January 2023 and scored 20 goals, helping them win the Conference League last season. 

He was part of Crystal Palace and then Tottenham's academy before spending four-and-a-half years in the Netherlands, where he won the Dutch Cup. 

Madueke made his England senior debut in August 2024 and set up Harry Kane's winner as Thomas Tuchel's side defeated Andorra 1-0 in World Cup qualification last month.

Arteta told Arsenal's website, external: "Noni is an exciting and powerful young player, with his performances and numbers in recent seasons being of consistently high quality. 

"He is one of the most talented wide forward players in the Premier League.

"At just 23, Noni already brings experience of club and international football, and he knows the Premier League very well. 

"Having seen the quality of Noni's performances up close in recent seasons, we're really excited he is joining us. His arrival will really improve our squad."

News of Arsenal's interest in the Chelsea winger had prompted a backlash from a section of the Gunners supporters earlier this month. 

A petition, titled #NoToMadueke, was signed more than 5,000 times and murals outside the club's Emirates Stadium were vandalised with 'Arteta out'.

Madueke becomes Arsenal's fourth signing of the summer and second from Chelsea following the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. 

Midfielders Christian Norgaard from Brentford and Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad have also joined while the club are also close to signing striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting and Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera. 

Why #NoToMadueke is trending among Arsenal fans

Madueke plays predominantly on the right, with 88% of his Premier League minutes having come on a side of the pitch that is dominated by Bukayo Saka at Arsenal.

Saka, 23, started 108 of 114 league matches from 2021-22 to 2023-24 but missed three months of last season because of a hamstring injury.

Madueke would be a capable option as back-up to Saka but can also play on the left.

He was one of England's standout performers in the recent international break and his assist from the left for Kane's winning goal against Andorra was one of three in his first seven matches for his country.

Madueke also started four of the Blues' final five Premier League matches of the season on that side - plus the Conference League final - and he could be direct competition for Gabriel Martinelli there.

You can see why Arteta might be excited about the prospect of signing Madueke.

His expected goals (9.6), his number of shots (80), touches in the opposition box (199) and progressive carries with the ball (242) were all higher than Martinelli and Saka in the Premier League last season.

Saka only played in 25 league matches compared to Madueke's 32, so it is a fairer comparison with Martinelli, who played 33 times.

Madueke also contributed a combined 10 goals and assists to Chelsea last season and could boost Arsenal's much-criticised attack.

Injuries plagued Arteta's side last season and they ended the season with limited options in the final third as they fell away in the title race.

Madueke is one of the most direct wingers in the league and Arsenal, who mainly play against teams who defend deep against them, could benefit from his eagerness to beat his defender and get a shot at goal.

'That's beautiful!' - Robinson scores 81-yard touchdown run

Bijan Robinson rushed for a career-high 170 yards, including an 81-yard touchdown, as the Atlanta Falcons upset the Buffalo Bills with a 24-14 win on Monday night.

The Bills, favourites for the Super Bowl, were the only unbeaten team in the NFL heading into last week's Sunday night football but have now lost two in a row to slip to 4-2.

Robinson, who also had 68 yards receiving, gave the Falcons a decisive two-touchdown lead at the start of the second half with his career-long touchdown run and the Bills could not mount a comeback.

Bills quarterback Josh Allen, last season's Most Valuable Player, threw for 180 yards but also had interceptions at the end of each half.

Falcons quarterback Michael Penix threw for 250 yards - 158 of those to star receiver Drake London - and a touchdown at Mercedes-Benz Stadium to help steer the home side (3-2) to victory.

A Tyler Allgeier touchdown had put the Falcons in front before Allen found tight end Dawson Knox in the end zone.

A London touchdown and then Robinson's sensational 81-yard run put the Falcons 21-7 up, but Allen found running Ray Davis to reduce the deficit to 21-14.

Atlanta's Parker Romo kicked a 33-yard field goal with one minute 43 seconds remaining to make sure of victory.

Jake Moody is hoisted in the air by his Bears team-mates after his winning kick

In Monday night's other game, a last-gasp 38-yard Jake Moody field goal with three seconds left gave the Chicago Bears a thrilling 25-24 victory at the Washington Commanders.

The San Francisco 49ers took Moody with a rare pick on a kicker in round three of the 2023 draft but they then cut him after a poor week one performance this season.

He signed to the Bears practice squad and was activated for Monday's game after an injury to Cairo Santos.

"It feels amazing," said Moody. "To get all that support from all my team-mates after the game, it was an amazing feeling."

Two Moody field goals and a rushing touchdown from quarterback Caleb Williams put Chicago 13-0 up before Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels found Chris Moore to reduce the deficit to six points at Northwest Stadium.

Matt Gay and Moody traded field goals before Daniels threw to Luke McCaffrey and Zach Ertz for touchdowns as Washington opened up a 24-16 lead.

A 55-yard D'Andre Swift receiving touchdown gave the Bears a chance to tie the game but they missed a two-point conversion, leaving the Commanders 24-22 ahead.

But a Daniels fumble gave possession back to the Bears, who drove down the field to set up Moody's winning kick with three seconds left, leaving the Commaneders with a 3-3 record.

"That's who we are. We fight," said Williams, who threw for one touchdown and 252 yards as his team moved to 3-2.

"We're 3-2 because of our fight, because of how we face adversity and come together."

Here’s what you need to know: Bill Belichick won six Super Bowls as a head coach and two more as a defensive co-ordinator

US President Donald Trump and former star quarterback Tom Brady have said it is "ridiculous" legendary former NFL coach Bill Belichick has reportedly been denied first-ballot induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Belichick is widely considered the greatest coach in NFL history, having won six Super Bowl titles as head coach of the New England Patriots with Brady at quarterback, and two as defensive co-ordinator with the New York Giants,

He reportedly fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction in his first year of eligibility, leading to widespread criticism from prominent sporting figures as well as Trump.

Trump posted on social media to say it was "ridiculous and should be overturned".

Three-time NFL MVP Brady, who won a seventh Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021 before retiring two years later, said he could not understand the decision.

"If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, which is completely ridiculous because people deserve it," Brady told Seattle Sports 710 AM.

"He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl - give me one season - I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said."

Belichick's failure to gain sufficient votes could be a result of two scandals, known as Spy-gate and Deflate-gate, that engulfed the Patriots franchise during his time at the helm, according to ESPN, external.

However, Brady said he was "not worried" that Belichick would never be entered into the Hall of Fame.

He added: "We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen, and he's gonna have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything he did, the commitment he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives."

Brady banned over 'Deflate-gate'

The Spy-gate scandal, in 2007, saw the team heavily fined and a first-round draft pick taken away after they were caught recording the New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorised location during a match.

Eight years later they were fined $1m - equivalent to Â£642,000 at the time - and quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for four games after an inquiry into under-inflated balls, which it was alleged gave the star more grip in cold and wet conditions.

Trump and Brady's comments followed those of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who wrote on X: "Insane... don't even understand how this could be possible."

Meanwhile, NBA great LeBron James posted: "Man there's no way I read that right! Right? Ain't no way Bill Belichick ain't 1st Ballot HOF!! That's impossible, egregious, and quite frankly disrespectful!"

In addition to his Super Bowl victories, Belichick won nine conference championships, 17 division titles and he is second on the all-time wins list, including playoffs, with 333.

He left the Patriots in January 2024 after 24 years and currently coaches the University of North Carolina in the college form of the game.

The Hall of Fame's voting committee is made up of mostly veteran NFL reporters, but also includes former players and coaches.

Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, who was inducted in 2006 after three Super Bowl wins, described it as a "disappointing day for the Pro Football Hall of Fame".

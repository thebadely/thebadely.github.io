Experts revealed that A-level students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will soon know their grades, with the arrival of results day 2025.

Here is your guide to this year's results, appeals and resits.

AS and A-level results will be released on Thursday, 14 August.

You can normally pick up your results in person anytime from 08:00 BST, or you may receive an email, but check with your school or college as arrangements can vary.

Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E.

Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade.

They are decided by assessment specialists at each exam board every year, and are only published once results day arrives.

Some exam boards, like AQA, have their old grade boundaries for previous years' exams published on their website.

If you do not think your grade is right, you should first talk to your school or college.

It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed.

If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review, you can ask your school or college to appeal.

The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed.

If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual.

If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. 

You could also try applying for a different place through the clearing process - see more details below.

It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. 

Resits will take place in May or June 2026.

The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) runs a clearing process matching students with university and college courses which still have spaces.

Students can use it if they:

Clearing opens on 5 July and closes on 20 October.

Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or the Ucas tariff points system.

Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points.

Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work.

Others take a gap year so they have more time to decide what to do next.

Scotland has a different qualification system. Students take Highers instead of A-levels.

Results day in Scotland is on Tuesday 5 August.

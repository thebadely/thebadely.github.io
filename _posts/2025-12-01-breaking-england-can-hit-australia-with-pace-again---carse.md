It has been recently reported that Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse (right) are set to be in England's XI for the second Test

Brydon Carse believes England can once again hit Australia with pace in the second Ashes Test in Brisbane.

The tourists suffered a crushing defeat in the first Test, though on the opening day in Perth returned the highest collective average speed recorded by an England attack.

England are set to be without their fastest bowler Mark Wood for Thursday's second Test, a day-nighter.

Asked whether England can recreate the pace of the Perth first innings, Carse told BBC Sport: "I'd like to think so. We take a lot of confidence individually and as a group, and we're really excited for what this week has to offer.

"It's exciting. It's special to be part of a pace attack like that. Going forward into this week and for the remainder of the series, we've certainly got players and bowlers that are exciting and can hopefully change games."

England dismissed Australia for 132 in the first innings, but struggled to back up their collective pace in the second as the hosts raced to their victory target of 205 in 28.2 overs.

One factor was the lack of rest given to the bowlers. England bowled twice on the second day after being dismissed in 34.4 overs in their second innings.

In the aftermath of the Perth defeat, the first two-day Ashes Test for 104 years, England head coach Brendon McCullum highlighted the need for batters to give bowlers longer to recuperate.

"The volume of overs we bowled in that first innings wasn't as it would be in a normal full day," said Carse, who has taken 41 wickets in his 10 Tests.

"There is no excuse there, having to bowl on day two. I'm sure as the series goes on, those rest days will become important. It's something we'll assess, nearer to the time and on the situation of the game."

Wood is unlikely to feature in Brisbane because of soreness in the left knee upon which he had surgery in March.

In Wood's absence, England could again go for an all-pace attack and bring Josh Tongue into the side. If they opt for a spinner, Shoaib Bashir has been their recent first-choice, while Will Jacks offers all-round cover.

Carse 'excited' for day-night Test

All of the England squad except for Wood took part in England's first training session under lights at the Gabba on Monday.

Whereas Australia are experienced in day-night Tests - 14 of the 24 previous floodlit matches worldwide have involved Australia - England have played only seven, losing five.

England's training session on Tuesday is in the afternoon, with a further stint under lights coming on Wednesday.

Ben Stokes' side are looking to level the series at a ground where England have an awful record. They have not won here since 1986.

Carse, 30, said England will be ready for a "hostile" atmosphere at the Gabba and will feel no extra pressure because of the 1-0 deficit.

England have not won any of their past 16 Tests in Australia, a run going back to 2011. With thousands of supporters due to travel over the Christmas period, Carse acknowledged the responsibility of keeping the series alive.

"The English support at Perth was fantastic," said the Durham man. "Someone was mentioning to me the other day the number of fans that are travelling throughout the Ashes series.

"We're very fortunate with the following and the support we get. Of course, every single player in that dressing room wants to win, as do the fans, as does everyone who follows English cricket. We'll be looking to put smiles on our faces and theirs."

Australia have yet to confirm who will open the batting after Usman Khawaja struggled with back spasms in Perth and his replacement in the second innings, Travis Head, crashed a match-winning hundred.

Khawaja went through some fitness exercises and batted in the nets on Monday.

"Usman's a high-quality player, you look at his record and what he's done for Australian cricket," said batter Marnus Labuschagne. "He's been super consistent and he's been the rock at the top there.

"I don't think he needs advice. He's 38, he's been around the block a long time. He is an amazing player."

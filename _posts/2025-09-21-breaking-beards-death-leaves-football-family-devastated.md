'Forever grateful' - Fara Williams pays tribute to Matt Beard

Fara Williams says Matt Beard was "one of a kind and had the purest of souls" after the death of the former Liverpool manager aged 47.

Williams was part of Beard's Liverpool side which won back-to-back Women's Super League titles in 2013 and 2014.

Speaking after the Reds' WSL game at Aston Villa was postponed, the former England midfielder described Beard as being "more than a manager" and a "great mentor and friend".

Manchester United boss Marc Skinner told BBC Sport "the football family is devastated" by Beard's death.

Beard began his managerial career with Millwall Lionesses in 2008 and won promotion in his first season. A three-year spell at Chelsea followed in which he took them to an FA Cup final.

He won back-to-back WSL titles with Liverpool in 2013 and 2014, and managed the club during their first ever Champions League campaign.

Beard's last role was at Burnley, where he resigned in June after just two months in charge.

It was also announced on Sunday that the Clarets' Women's National League match against West Brom had been postponed.

"The warmth he gave people. Whenever you came into contact with him there was something special about him," Williams told 5 Live.

"He always greeted you with a 'hello darling'. That was his line, a warm hug. He saw everyone as the same. He never had judgement of people. 

"Win, lose or draw in difficult moments that we have as sportspeople, he would never shy away from giving people his time. 

"Just a special guy. I wish he was here to see and feel that from all of us. He was one of a kind and had the purest of souls."

After spells with Boston Breakers, West Ham and Bristol City, Beard returned to Liverpool in 2021 for a four-year term and led the Reds to promotion back to the WSL.

Former England midfielder Williams, who scored 10 goals in 48 games for Liverpool, praised Beard's impact on her career.

"He was somebody that saw potential in me that maybe I didn't see myself. When I had difficult periods outside football he was there," said Williams. 

"He was like an older brother. We had laughs together, a similar humour. Just somebody that cared about everyone else.

"He gave a lot of love, he gave a lot of attention to people. He gave opportunities when people thought they were down and out. He was the guy that would find a space for them."

Williams also paid tribute to Beard for the impact he had on women's football.

"He was somebody that cared massively about the women's game and was there from the beginning," she said.

"He was fully focused on trying to drive and get the game to where it is now. I'm sure he will be proud of where the game is now and the part he played in that.

"He cared about the game, he cared about where he could take the game, he cared about people maybe more than he cared about himself. He gave attention and time and that is something you can't buy. 

"You can't buy somebody's time and investment. That is something he did with a lot of us, me in particular, and I am forever grateful for what he did for me."

Olivia Smith and Taylor Hinds, who both played for Beard at Liverpool before summer moves to Arsenal, played in Sunday's draw against Manchester United.

"We spoke to Olivia and Taylor, they were really close to Matt," Arsenal boss Renee Slegers said after the game.

"They both said Matt would have wanted them to play and they went out and did it. There was a lot of emotion.

"It was really hard for them but it shows a lot of strength to show up for the team. They weren't pressed into any of that but they wanted to do it. A lot of strength from their end."

Smith, who became the first Â£1m player when she joined the Gunners, was visibly emotional during the minute's silence at Leigh Sports Village.

The 21-year-old Canada international was signed by Beard in June 2024 for a club record Â£210,000.

"Wouldn't be where I am without you," she posted on Instagram alongside pictures of herself and Beard together on Sunday.

Hinds captained Liverpool under Beard and said he was "more than just a manager to myself and so many people".

"It hurts," she said on Instagram. "I still can't believe it. Absolutely heartbroken, shocked, devastated."

Skinner wants Beard to be remembered as an 'icon' and 'beautiful human'

A minute's silence took place in tribute to Beard before kick-off in all WSL and WSL2 games on Sunday.

Skinner described Beard as an "icon" and added: "I think he is as iconic as Emma [Hayes] is in the game.

"He has helped women's football for a long, long time. He has come from grassroots all the way up. In this sad, sombre moment it is nice to reflect on a beautiful human and somebody that I was very fond of. 

"He has and will continue to lead a legacy in our game. I'm a big believer in that you live on in people's memories. I know that I'll keep his legacy alive all the time by talking about him all the time."

Skinner said two members of his coaching staff -  Scott Rogers and goalkeeper coach Joe Pott - used to be Beard's assistants and they tell "so many funny stories" about him.

"I hope the women's football family comes together and in general the football family to celebrate a wonderful human and somebody I know will live long in the memory of everybody," added Skinner.

"Rather than the sadness, congratulations on the life you had. You have touched many people and your memory will live long and forever."

Former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Steph Houghton faced sides managed by Beard a number of times in her career and said he will leave a lasting impression on the game.

"It's so heartbreaking. He has left a huge impact on women's football from what he did at numerous clubs," she told BBC Sport.

"When women's football was just starting, he was a key figure. When you played against him you could see his personality and want to win. The most important thing is him as a human being, he would ask about your family after the game and show his love.

"His selfless nature stands out for me and he is going to be massively missed. From all of us at BBC, we give our love to his family and his loved ones."

England to face Scotland in quarter-finals after win over Australia

After three rounds of pool matches, the line-up for the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals has been confirmed.

Top four seeds England, Canada, New Zealand and France all qualified as pool winners, while Australia, Scotland, Ireland and South Africa advanced as runners-up.

Here are the four fixtures for next weekend, and you can find the final pool standings lower down the page.

Venue: Sandy Park, Exeter

Coverage: Watch live on BBC Two & iPlayer from 12:30 BST

Teenage star Braxton Sorensen-McGee scored a hat-trick as New Zealand powered past Ireland 40-0 to finish top of Pool C with three bonus-point wins. It was a ruthless performance in both defence and attack and demonstrated the Black Ferns' ability to peak at the right time in a major tournament.

South Africa shocked Italy in their second pool match to reach the quarter-finals for the first time, but were comprehensively outplayed by France in their final Pool D game and face a near-impossible task against the six-time champions.

Venue: Ashton Gate, Bristol

Canada overwhelmed Scotland 40-19 to ensure they clinched top spot in Pool B with a maximum 15 points from their three group games. Outstanding lock Sophie de Goede brings both physicality and quality to their side, plus a reliable kicking boot.

Australia gave England a serious test in the first half before being overpowered in their final Pool A match in Brighton, but still managed to qualify for the last eight on points difference. Talented backs Desiree Miller and Caitlyn Halse will take heart from Scotland scoring three times against Canada's usually rock solid defence.

France thrashed South Africa 57-10 to win Pool D with scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus pulling the strings, but preventing Six Nations rivals Italy from scoring in a 24-0 win in their opening match was their key result.

Ireland, who secured bonus-point wins over Japan and Spain to qualify, are set to be boosted by the return of Six Nations player of the tournament Aoife Wafer, who has yet to feature in the competition because of pre-tournament knee surgery. Despite a heavy loss to New Zealand, Ireland will fancy their chances of reversing their 27-15 defeat by France in the Women's Six Nations in March.

Venue: Ashton Gate, Bristol

England started slowly before overwhelming Australia 47-7 to secure top spot in Pool C. It was England's 30th successive Test win but with their backline not clicking to their usual standards, they needed their forwards to grind the Wallaroos down. World player of the year Ellie Kildunne will miss the quarter-final with concussion but England have formidable strength in depth.

Scotland scored three excellent tries but succumbed 40-19 to Canada in their final Pool B match. They will have to beat their old rivals for the first time since 1999 to keep alive their World Cup hopes. They were thrashed 59-7 in this year's Women's Six Nations and although they have improved since then, the gap between the sides is huge.

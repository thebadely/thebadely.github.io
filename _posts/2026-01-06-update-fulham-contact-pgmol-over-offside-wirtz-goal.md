It has been recently reported that Florian Wirtz's strike drew Liverpool level in the second half

Marco Silva says Fulham have contacted the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) over Florian Wirtz's controversial goal for Liverpool on Sunday.

Wirtz's 57th-minute strike during the Premier League game was initially flagged offside.

But despite replays suggesting the midfielder was in an offside position, the goal was allowed to stand after a video assistant referee (VAR) check to bring Liverpool level at 1-1.

The game went on to finish 2-2 as both sides netted during stoppage time, but Silva described Wirtz's goal as "a clear offside" and called for clarification.

"The club is trying to get in contact [with PGMOL] - until now we didn't have any feedback," Silva said.

It is understood dialogue between Fulham and PGMOL will likely take place as part of the latter's ongoing private engagement with clubs under chief Howard Webb.

Having looked at several images since the weekend, Silva said he "cannot believe" the decision made by officials.

"We are still waiting for some feedback from the Premier League, from PGMOL, because it is very important for us," he said.

"We didn't have the one to make us understand why and not have the same opinion.

"Not just me... me, my staff, our football club, all the other players, fans. 

"I think if you go to ask all Premier League [teams, each club] is going to have the same opinion. All the people that love football will have the same opinion as myself."

Even Wirtz had not expected the goal to stand, telling Sky Sports: "I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate."

It was given, though, because positions are measured with a tolerance level of about 5cm (1.95in).

That was initially introduced to take into account inaccuries in the offside technology used several seasons ago - for example, being able to judge the correct moment the ball had been passed.

In effect, a player could be positioned marginally offside but ruled onside when the tolerance level was applied.

The Premier League retained that tolerance level when moving over to the semi-automated offside system now used.

Another element involved is the choice of frame. The video assistant referee (VAR) is offered three frames and chooses the first to show contact in the act of playing the ball. It is not when the ball leaves the foot.

In Wirtz's case, the VAR chose one frame and TV broadcasters the next. Wirtz is more clearly offside in the second.

That, however, has not placated Silva, who said: "I don't have a way to measure, but in my opinion it is much more than 5cm.

"When you see the moment of the pass in all the images, the player was clear offside."

He also questioned where the tolerance level was a month ago when Emile Smith Rowe had a goal disallowed against Crystal Palace with Samuel Chukwueze narrowly offside in the build-up.

"Where was the story about 5cm tolerance when we scored against Palace?" Silva asked.

"It was half of the nail, probably 1cm or 2cm that was offside."

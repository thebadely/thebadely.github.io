It has been recently reported that Photographs of Paul Doyle appear on all but two of the front pages.

"Seven charges" is the Daily Mirror's headline - referring to the offences he's accused of during the Liverpool victory parade. 

The Daily Express describes Mr Doyle as a "businessman and a father of three".

The Sun, like other papers, highlights his background as a former Royal Marine.

It quotes Mersey-Cheshire's Chief Crown Prosecutor as saying every victim "should get the justice they deserve".

The Daily Mail put its weight behind Kemi Badenoch's intervention in the debate about the future of the two-child benefit cap. 

In its editorial, the paper calls her attack on Labour and Reform UK "powerfully argued" - and shrewd in not over-promising. 

It adds, though, that given her party's precarious position in the polls, the Conservative leader needs to make more of an impact on the public's imagination.

According to the Guardian, Badenoch is safe for now, despite grassroots disquiet.

The paper also warns against writing off the Tories, given the party's ability to re-invent itself.

The Times and the Daily Telegraph lead with a speech by Attorney General Lord Hermer, in which he criticised calls from Tory and Reform politicians to pull the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights. 

The Times says he likened them to Nazis. 

The Telegraph reports that Lord Hermer said the calls echoed similar demands in 1930s Germany to reject international law in favour of state power.

The Financial Times says that Ryanair's boss could be set for one of the biggest performance pay-outs in European corporate history. 

The paper says Michael O'Leary has qualified for stock options worth more than €100m (£84.2m) after the airline met share price targets.

The i Paper looks at Foreign Secretary David Lammy's visit to the Arctic this week.

The government said it wanted to tackle "growing threats" there.

The former foreign minister, Tobias Ellwood, tells the paper that in 2016 he tried and failed to get Boris Johnson to buy a stretch of land put up for sale by Norway for £250m. 

Mr Ellwood said it would have given the UK a strategic "foothold" in the Arctic.

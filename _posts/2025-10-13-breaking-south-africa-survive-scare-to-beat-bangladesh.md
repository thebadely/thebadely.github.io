Scorecard; Table

Nadine de Klerk got South Africa over the line again as they recovered from another top-order collapse to beat Bangladesh by three wickets at the Women's World Cup.

Having been set 233 to win in Visakhapatnam, the Proteas slipped to 78-5 before half-centuries from Chloe Tryon, who made 62 from 69 balls, and Marizanne Kapp, 56 from 71 balls, brought them back into contention.

Kapp fell with 70 still needed to bring De Klerk - fresh from her heroics against India - to the middle, and for a time it seemed that she and Tryon would get South Africa home comfortably.

Instead, Tryon was run out with 35 required and there were more uncomfortable moments to come as De Klerk twice miscued in the penultimate over with match in the balance.

While the first skied shot landed safely, the second went straight to long-off but Shorna Akter dropped the catch - a particularly cruel moment given it was the 18-year-old's superb 34-ball fifty that had earlier taken Bangladesh up to a competitive total.

But having been given that life, De Klerk - who ended unbeaten on 37 from 29 balls - made sure she finished the job and a mighty six over the leg side sealed the victory with three balls to spare.

While South Africa can celebrate a third straight win, and a second in a row in which they have battled back from a losing position, Bangladesh are left to rue a number of crucial dropped catches.

Rabeya Khan put down a simple chance off her own bowling to give Proteas skipper Laura Wolvaardt a chance early on.

Sub fielder Soumya Akter then dropped Tryon on 46 off Rabeya's bowling in the 44th over, allowing the ball to run away for four, with the next ball disappearing for six before Shorna's drop late on.

Bangladesh will surely feel that defeats do not come much more painful than this.

Nigar Sultana Joty's side executed their plan near-perfectly for 75 overs of the match and even as South Africa hit back in the last 25 - the difference between victory and defeat came down to a couple of moments.

With the bat, it quickly became apparent that keeping wickets in hand took priority above all else as they crawled through the powerplay.

It was all about giving themselves a chance to go hard late on and thanks to a maiden international fifty - Bangladesh's quickest in a women's ODI - from the talented Shorna, they did just that.

They had a total to bowl at and a strong bowling attack soon got to work. South Africa opener Tazmin Brits gone first ball and Wolvaardt should have followed a couple of overs later.

A winning combination of discipline and guile from the spinners put Bangladesh in a great position as, for the third time in four World Cup matches, South Africa's top-order crumbled.

But there is an inner belief within this Proteas group that previous sides have lacked and with the experienced duo of Kapp and Tryon, they gradually rebuilt.

More luck was required than against India but the scares they suffered as the finishing line got closer did not shake them, good fortune was accepted and it was onto the next ball.

The top-order will have to come to the party at some stage but, at this stage of the tournament, the fighting spirit they have shown in finding ways to win can only be a good thing.

It is a lesson Bangladesh must hope their young team can take from such a gut-wrenching loss.

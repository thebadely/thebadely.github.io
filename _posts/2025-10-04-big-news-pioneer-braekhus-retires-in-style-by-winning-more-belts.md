Let's dive into the details: Cecilia Braekhus - the first female four-belt undisputed champion - ends her career as a two-weight world champion

Norway's Cecilia Braekhus ended her illustrious career in style, beating Ema Kozin on points to claim the WBC and WBO light-middleweight titles in her final bout.

The 44-year-old rolled back the years with sharp attacks to the head and body in a dominant performance in Lillestrom.

The judges scored it 97-93, 96-94 and 98-92, as Braekhus became a world champion in a second weight division.

The 'First Lady' of boxing fell to her knees when the scores were read out, with head in hands - clearly overcome with emotion, having previously announced that the fight would be her last.

"I want to thank the boxing community all over the world, my friends in England, LA, everyone. I'm so happy," Braekhus said.

Braekhus - who in 2014 became the first female boxer to hold all four major belts simultaneously - retires with a record of 39 wins, two defeats and one draw.

Having made her debut in 2007, she dominated the welterweight division, defending her unified world titles for more than a decade.

She was also instrumental in overturning Norway's 33-year ban on professional boxing in 2014, making her retirement on home soil especially poignant.

How 'First Lady' Braekhus ended Norway's boxing ban

Slovenian southpaw Kozin, 26, started fast but Braekhus quickly found her rhythm.

The home fighter landed combinations - including a double hook in the second - to take control of a bout billed as 'The Final Bell'. 

A crowd of 3,000 fans at the Nova Spektrum arena were on their feet in the fourth as she landed a flush combination. 

Kozin was making the first defence of the titles she won against Briton Hannah Rankin in November 2023.

Her only previous defeat came against pound-for-pound star Claressa Shields in 2022.

Unusually, the MC read the scores before the fifth, with all judges giving Braekhus a two-round lead.

Kozin pressed forward grimacing but offered little. A right hook to the temple and a whipping left to the body in the eighth appeared to hurt her further.

As Braekhus came out for the final round, her face showed no emotion yet she was determined to put on a show, throwing punches until the final bell.

Braekhus inspired a generation of women to lace up the gloves, although defeat by Jessica McCaskill and a draw with Britain's Terri Harper hinted at a decline in recent years.

But the holder of three Guinness World Records - for the longest-reigning female world champion (11 years, 154 days), the longest unbeaten streak (36 fights), and the longest reign as undisputed champion (five years, 337 days) - was insistent on retiring as a world champion.

The victory ensured she did just that, and it was a fitting finale for the woman who brought professional boxing back to Norway and exits the sport entirely on her own terms.

Braekhus - who promoted the event through her First Lady Promotions outfit - says she now plans to take a break from boxing, but with her experience and knowledge, she has plenty to offer the sport in whatever role comes next.

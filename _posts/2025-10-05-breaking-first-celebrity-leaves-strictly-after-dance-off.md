Let's dive into the details: The first two contestants faced the dreaded Strictly dance-off on Sunday night to decide their fate.

And in the end, it was former Apprentice star Thomas Skinner who left the show, after judges voted to save former England rugby captain Chris Robshaw.

When asked by co-host Tess Daly about his experience on the show, Skinner, 34, paid tribute to his professional dance partner Amy Dowden.

“Thank you, Amy - sorry that we haven't done too good, 'cause you're a different class,” he said.

Skinner hit the headlines before the series had even started, after walking out of a press conference early - something he later apologised for.

But the social media personality insisted he had "loved" his time on Strictly.

"I've never danced before and my stay was short, but Amy's amazing. It's been great fun and I've enjoyed it. I can't really dance that well but I've had fun!"

On Sunday night, both couples performed their routines from Saturday once again.

Skinner and Dowden did their salsa to Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal and Armand van Helden, while Robshaw and his partner Nadiya Bychkova reprised their Viennese waltz to Die With A Smile by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.

After the dances, the judges delivered their verdicts - and it was Robshaw and Bychkova who won the majority vote, leaving Skinner and Dowden to say their farewells.

Dowden also complimented her dance partner, saying: "I've got to know the real Tom, and he is adorable. He's looked after me. We've laughed so much."

Dowden has been candid about her wish to get back on the dance floor following her diagnosis with breast cancer two years ago.

She made a return to Strictly in 2024 but had to pull out midway through the series due to an injury.

Speaking on Saturday night, she said winning the glitterball would have been "amazing", but added: "What I've learnt in the last few years is happiness, health and being alive is more important than anything."

Addressing Skinner, she went on to say: "The last three years as you know have been quite difficult for me. I lost all confidence as a dancer - but walking into the room with you with a massive smile and a laugh, you brought me back and, honestly, thank you."

During Saturday night's live show, Skinner - sporting a clingy, sparkly vest top - hoisted Dowden up so often during their routine, judge Craig Revel Horwood joked it looked more like a weightlifting competition.

They scored 13 points, placing them at the bottom of this week's leaderboard.

Scores from week one and two were added to the public vote to decide which couples should face the dance-off.

Skinner first hit TV screens on The Apprentice in 2019, and has since appeared on shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats, The Wheel, Michael McIntyre's Big Show, Good Morning Britain and Faking It, as well as Celebrity Masterchef.

He is also known for social media videos, runs a number of businesses, including a gym, and is a regular on TalkSport Radio.

The remaining 14 couples will take to the dancefloor next week for Movie Week.

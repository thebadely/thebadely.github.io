According to new developments, Henry Pollock (second from the right) is one of four Northampton Saints players named in Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions squad for Australia 

Northampton Saints flanker Henry Pollock says his selection for the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia was "the best day of his life".

The 20-year-old, who started the year off playing for England in the Under-20 Six Nations, was named in Andy Farrell's 38-strong party on Thursday to mark a rapid rise.

Pollock went on to score two tries on his England senior debut against Wales in March, before starring for Saints as they reached the Investec Champions Cup final on 24 May.

"It sounds mad [to say I am a British and Irish Lion] . I am honoured and can't really believe it," Pollock told BBC Look East.

"We were all watching it and hoping for the best and when it got announced, all the boys jumped on me.

"It was a feeling I will never forget. It was probably the best day of my life."

Pollock's inclusion generated the loudest cheer from about 2,000 fans inside Indigo, a venue within London's O2 Arena complex.

The flanker, who is the youngest player in the squad, won World Rugby's Under-20 Championship in July with England, before making his first Premiership start in October.

Pollock has gone on to establish himself in Northampton's competitive back row, and on Saturday scored a sensational solo try by showing incredible pace to round Leinster fly-half Sam Prendergast in their Champions Cup semi-final win in Dublin.

Four Saints players were named in Farrell's squad with Tommy Freeman, Alex Mitchell and Fin Smith all joining Pollock, who watched the announcement with a number of his team-mates.

"I walked out of the room and tried to phone my mum, who didn't pick up which was class," he joked.

"I then called mum and dad and they were balling their eyes out crying.

"I am just so happy that I've made them happy, I am honoured."

Pollock was selected instead of Toulouse flanker Jack Willis, Sale Sharks' Ben Curry and Scotland's Rory Darge, with Farrell admitting that, in the end, he did not need convincing about selecting the one-cap flanker.

An all-action display on both sides of the ball against Leinster, who have 12 players heading on the Lions tour, showed Pollock can compete with the best and he plans to show that in Australia.

He faces tough back row competition in Ireland's Jack Conan and Josh van der Flier, England pair Tom Curry and Ben Earl, and Wales captain Jac Morgan, but remains confident of adding value.

"It is the pinnacle of the sport and everything that you work for and want to achieve in rugby," he added.

"I hope to bring a different X-factor and just be myself. I am not going to go there and go into my shell, I am just going to be myself and hopefully bring a different side to the squad than other players."

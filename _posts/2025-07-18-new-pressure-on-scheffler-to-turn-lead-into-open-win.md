Scheffler shoots seven-under 64 to lead Open

The pressure is on Scottie Scheffler to turn his halfway lead into a first Open Championship victory, rather than on those chasing him, says nearest challenger Matt Fitzpatrick.

Late starter Scheffler quietly compiled a best-in-class 64 at Royal Portrush to crest the leaderboard at the end of a second day that mixed a blizzard of birdies with bursts of apocalyptic rain.

The three-time major winner endured the worst of the downpours on the Northern Ireland coastline but dropped just one shot in an accomplished round that included birdies at 16 and 17 to edge the American into the lead.

The world number one and Fitzpatrick will be paired together on Saturday and the Sheffield native - who is looking to become the first English winner of The Open in 33 years - insists he does not feel burdened by the circumstances.

"Scottie is going to have the expectation to go out and dominate," the 2022 US Open champion said. "He's an exceptional player, the world number one, and we're seeing Tiger-like stuff. 

"I think the pressure is for him. I wouldn't say I feel as much pressure."

Scheffler started the week by saying professional golf was "not a fulfilling life" and questioned "the point" of zealously pursuing victories.

And the 29-year-old did not watch any of the day's play before beginning his round in the middle of the afternoon.

A violent spell of rain drenched his opening few holes, before the subsequent softening of the links and calmer conditions allowed him to target the flags and post a stiff target for the rest of the field to chase.

Fitzpatrick continues to shine at The Open

Fitzpatrick, who edged out Scheffler to win his sole major at Brookline, is the closest challenger after willing in a 24-foot par putt on the 18th for a 66.

The 30-year-old has been on an upturn in form since shooting 78 and 72 to miss the cut in The Players Championship in March - which he described as the lowest point of his career - following a run of just one top-10 finish in the previous year and a fall outside the top 80 in the world rankings.

As spring gave way to summer, coaching changes brought consistency, with a tie for fourth place at last week's Scottish Open showcasing his renewed confidence.

Portrush is the scene of Fitzpatrick's best Open finish - although the word 'best' is doing some heavy lifting, given he was tied for 20th place at the Antrim course in 2019.

However in his 10th appearance at the event, he is right in the mix to become the first Englishman to lift the Claret Jug since Sir Nick Faldo at Muirfield in 1992. 

"I've given myself an opportunity, but there's still a long way to go," Fitzpatrick said. 

"There's nothing better than being in contention. It feels a bit uncomfortable at the time, but you want to feel that. It means you're doing something right.

"It's an exciting position for me to be in given where I was earlier this year."

Tucked one behind Fitzpatrick and two adrift of Scheffler are 2023 Open champion Brian Harman of the United States and Li Haotong of China.

World number 111 Li has dropped just one shot in posting a pair of 67s, while Harman plotted his way round in a blemish-free 65.

'Oh my!' - MacIntyre shows finesse to hole back-to-back birdies

Fitzpatrick is not the only Englishman with visions of emulating Faldo.

Tyrrell Hatton is five back after adding a 69 to his opening 68, but it's pints more than shots that were on his mind after finishing his round.

The 33-year-old revealed his pre-Open preparations included a visit to a nearby pitch and putt course, followed by three pints of the well-known local stout. 

Asked if he would repeat that formula after Friday's round, the world number 23 replied: "Be rude not to. I think three's the magic number."

Hatton and Robert MacIntyre of Scotland both contended in last month's US Open as they search for a debut major victory.

And MacIntyre says his runner-up finish at Oakmont has inbued him with the belief he can soon take that next step in his career.

McIlroy certain he can still 'make a run' at Open

Is Sunday too soon? The 28-year-old thinks not after his splendid six-birdie 66 also left him within five of Scheffler.

"I'm not scared. I'm not going to back away," said the world number 14. 

"If I've got a chance, I'm going to roll the dice. I've got so much more confidence and so much more belief that I am good enough."

Hatton and MacIntyre will be making their way round not long after Rory McIlroy and the swollen crowds that will inevitably follow the local favourite. 

The second best player in the world reckons he, too, can "make a run" over the weekend, having avoided a repeat of the ignominious early exit that befell him the last time The Open was in Portrush in 2019.

"I've been somewhat close to my best over the first two days in little bits here and there," said McIlroy, speaking before Scheffler put seven shots between the pair. 

"I'm going to need to have it all under control and have it all firing over the weekend to make a run."

It has been recently reported that Dro Fernandez made five appearances for Barcelona's senior side

Paris St-Germain have signed 18-year-old Barcelona midfielder Dro Fernandez, with the Spanish side's president calling the situation around the transfer "unpleasant".

According to Spanish media, external, PSG have paid 8.2m euros (Â£7.1m) for Fernandez - a fee that is higher than his 6m euros (Â£5.2m) release clause - in a bid to keep good relations between the clubs.

The Spanish midfielder's departure has been controversial as he had been expected to sign a new contract at Barcelona.

But he has now completed a move to PSG on a deal until 2030.

"It has been an unpleasant situation," Barca president Joan Laporta told Catalunya Radio.

"It came as a surprise because we had agreed on a different solution for when he turned 18.

"Surprisingly, his representative told us he couldn't follow through on what we'd agreed to."

Fernandez joined Barcelona's La Masia academy in 2022 and has made five senior appearances since his debut in September, including in the Champions League against Olympiacos.

PSG said the signing was "fully in line with the club's sporting strategy, which is heavily focused on youth and talent".

Fernandez said his move was a "moment of huge pride" and PSG was "a massive club that I've followed since I was a child and where some great legends have made history".

In a separate post on Instagram, he wrote: "After nearly four unforgettable seasons, today I have to make one of the most difficult decisions of my life: saying goodbye to the club that has been my home in recent years."

Asked about Fernandez's future earlier this month, Barca coach Hansi Flick said young players needed to "live for" the club and suggested the teenager would be making a mistake if he moved to France.

"We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, every day, with the best players in the world. We give them the opportunity, we give them the support, believe in them, the confidence," he said.

"If you want to play for Barca, then [do it] 100% with your whole heart.

"This is what I want to say to everyone who is now with us, or in the future with us, this must be 100%.

"These colours, you have to live for them, this is what I want to see. All the others I don't want, this is what I can say.

"Sometimes you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make the decisions, they have people around them."

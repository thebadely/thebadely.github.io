Experts revealed that Stan Moody achieved his highest ranking of 61st in the world in August 2025

English teenager Stan Moody's unexpected run in the Wuhan Open has ended in the quarter-finals following a defeat by defending champion Xiao Guodong.

Moody, from Halifax, defeated Ding Junhui and Barry Hawkins to reach his maiden ranking quarter-final.

However, the 18-year-old, who is ranked 61st in the world, couldn't trouble the 2024 champion, who completed a comfortable 5-2 win.

Xiao will face Mark Williams in the last four - the Welshman beat Zhang Anda 5-1.

It will be Williams' 68th appearance in the semi-finals of a ranking event, with the 50-year-old telling the World Snooker website he has to "pinch myself sometimes" as he continues to compete at the business end of tournaments despite being "20 years past" his peak.

In the opposite half of the draw, England's Gary Wilson beat Scotland's John Higgins 5-3 to set up a semi-final with Northern Ireland's Mark Allen, who beat 2024 runner-up Si Jiahui 5-4.

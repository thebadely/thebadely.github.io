It has been recently reported that Savannah Wilkinson led the scoring for Great Britain with 20 points

Great Britain's women got their EuroBasket 2027 qualification campaign back on track with a comfortable 91-48 victory against Norway in Bergen.

Britain had begun their qualifiers with a win against Switzerland in Manchester but fell to a narrow defeat by Austria in Vienna in their second outing last weekend.

But they took command against the Norwegians early, with Savannah Wilkinson dropping 12 points in the first quarter alone as the visitors surged to a 26-16 lead.

They did not let their advantage slip, stretching the gap to 53-25 by half-time and eventually cruising to victory to seal a dominant performance on the road.

Wilkinson led the way for Britain with 20 points followed by Hannah Jump and Temi Fagbenle with 13 apiece, while Stine Austgulen topped Norway's scoring charts with 18 points.

The women's team, who participated in the qualifiers despite Fiba's suspension of the British Basketball Federation, will play their remaining three fixtures of the first round in March 2026. 

The top two sides from each group will progress to the second round of qualifying, along with the three best-performing third-placed teams from the seven groups.

The next edition of EuroBasket will be co-hosted by Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Lithuania in June 2027.

Experts revealed that Babar Azam has scored 4,223 runs in 128 T20 internationals, only eight fewer than all-time leading run-scorer Rohit Sharma

Pakistan batter Babar Azam will play in the Big Bash for the first time after he was signed by Sydney Sixers before next week's player draft.

The former national captain, the second-highest run scorer in the history of T20 internationals, will be available for the entirety of the 2025-26 season.

Babar, 30, has played 320 T20 matches in a number of competitions around the world, and most recently was the top run-scorer for Peshawar Zalmi in the Pakistan Super League.

However, he was not selected for Pakistan's recent T20 series against Bangladesh.

"It's an exciting opportunity to play in one of the world's best T20 leagues and to be a part of such a successful and respected franchise," said Babar.

Sixers finished second in the 2024-25 season, but suffered successive defeats in the play-offs, losing to Hobart Hurricanes before being knocked out by rivals Sydney Thunder.

Each franchise is allowed to contract one overseas player prior to Thursday's draft.

Sixers were the only men's side not to have signed their overseas player, with England's Jamie Overton, Chris Jordan, Tom Curran and Sam Billings all contracted to other teams.

England duo Jacob Bethell and Ollie Pope, who both played in the competition for the first time last season, are among the players entered in the draft.

They could both be retained by their previous franchises, Melbourne Renegades or Adelaide Strikers respectively, with each team allowed to retain one further player in the draft.

Amy Jones, Alice Capsey, Dani Gibson, Heather Knight, Sophie Ecclestone and Danni Wyatt-Hodge could all be retained in the women's competition, where no English players have been pre-signed.

England's Sam Curran and Lauren Bell and Pakistan trio Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan and Shadab Khan are among the new names to be available in the draft.

BBL: Jamie Overton (Eng, Adelaide Strikers), Colin Munro (NZ, Brisbane Heat), Chris Jordan (Eng, Hobart Hurricanes), Tim Seifert (NZ, Melbourne Renegades), Tom Curran (Eng, Melbourne Stars), Finn Allen (NZ, Perth Scorchers), Babar Azam (Pak, Sydney Sixers), Sam Billings (Eng, Sydney Thunder)

WBBL: Laura Wolvaardt (SA, Adelaide Strikers), Nadine de Klerk (SA, Brisbane Heat), Hayley Matthews (WI, Melbourne Renegades), Marizanne Kapp (SA, Melbourne Stars), Sophie Devine (NZ, Perth Scorchers), Amelia Kerr (NZ, Sydney Sixers), Chamari Athapaththu (Sri, Sydney Thunder) 

All players must be available for entire BBL/WBBL season. Hobart Hurricanes have not pre-signed an overseas player for the WBBL.

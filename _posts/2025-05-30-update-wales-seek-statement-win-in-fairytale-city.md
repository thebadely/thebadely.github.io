If tension is building in the Wales squad in the build up to Euro 2025, it's not showing.

It is little more than a month before the lowest-ranked side at Switzerland this summer appear at a major finals for the first time.

Already written off by many, they are yet to record a win in League A of the Nations League and need to avoid defeat against Denmark on Friday if they are to avoid dropping out of the top-tier.

In fact, with fixtures against former winners, current holders, and traditional women's football powerhouses all in store this summer, it's worth remembering that Wales have never managed competitive win against a side in the top 20 of Fifa's rankings.

And yet the mood of the Welsh camp is one that is more determined than daunted, given the strides they have made.

"This team is ready to win, let me tell you," said head coach Rhian Wilkinson with two games left before they kick-off their Euros tournament; Italy in Swansea on Tuesday following this Danish test against a side ranked 12th in the world.

"This is what these next two games are about; how do we show up and get a result? There's no reason to hide from that, I'm excited by it."

They looked it too as Wilkinson and Wales prepared in a city where they could easily find more inspiration.

And although it is tempting to talk of fairytales in the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen, there is more relevance to another son of Odense whose name adorns a stand above where Wales will play on Friday.

On the approach to the stadium is a tribute to the monumental achievement of Richard Moller-Nielsen, the manager who led the country to one of international football's great shocks in 1992.

The men's European championships won by a team who had not been meant to be there.

A reminder of the possibilities, then, for a side that have certainly earned the right to be at this stage - and are adamant that they are getting better.

While their last appearance in League A brought heavy defeats, Wales have been consistently competitive this time around.

"Every game is a challenging game against opposition who've been at Euros and World Cups in the past," said captain Angharad James. 

"We're putting on performances that we can be proud of, but we still have room to be better - and we will be better."

There is evidence to show they are getting there.

Wales' defeats by Italy and Denmark were both by the odd goal. They should have taken a glorious chance to beat Denmark in Cardiff a month ago, only to concede soon after.

And they followed up a 1-1 draw with Sweden in Cardiff with a superb performance in Gothenburg that produced the same scoreline.

They have looked defensively sound, caused problems on the counter, rarely overawed, and aware of where they need to improve if they are to go from matching sides to beating them.

"This is where we want to be," added Wilkinson. "This team now that understands they are right where they should be, among the best in Europe in those top nations, there are frequently big scores â but these are tight margins.

"We want to keep getting better; we're not going to celebrate getting ties against big nations â some people have said it (the draw with Sweden) could have been Wales' best ever, but it's only 'so-far' because it's going to keep getting better.

"This team is constantly looking for more and that's who we want to be."

James spoke of the belief in a greater depth of the side, helped by Wilkinson's commendable decision to give experience to youngsters during this campaign.

Rhiannon Roberts was among those this week who acknowledged Wales will need to be more clinical in front of goal to add to their defensive record if they are to collect that statement win.

"The foundations are there, defensively we've been fantastic and now we need to put a little bit more pressure on ourselves to take our chances," said the Real Betis defender.

"But we already have the confidence we can beat these sides."

All that is left for Wales is to prove it and take that scalp, though Wilkinson denied there is a psychological need to do so before Switzerland.

"We're here not by fluke," reminded Wilkinson. "And you don't get four consistent performances in row by accident, if things go our way in front of their net, we have every opportunity in the next two games to make that history. I'm surprised it hasn't happened already."

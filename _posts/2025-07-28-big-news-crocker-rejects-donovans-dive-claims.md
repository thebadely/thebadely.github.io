Experts revealed that Lewis Crocker and Paddy's Donovan's rematch at Windsor Park on 13 September will be for the vacant IBF welterweight title

Lewis Crocker dismissed Paddy Donovan assertion that he "took a dive" in their first fight when they met on Monday to launch their IBF World welterweight rematch on 13 September at Belfast's Windsor Park.

Belfast's Crocker won the first fight between the pair in March by way of disqualification with Donovan thrown out at the eighth round for punching after the bell of what was a world title eliminator.

Prior to the ending, the Limerick man had been deducted points in the sixth and eight rounds for fouls but also scored a legitimate knockdown just prior to the end.

The late shot that forced referee Marcus McDonnell to issue the ultimate punishment dropped Crocker who was awarded the win and a shot at then champion Jaron 'Boots' Ennis.

However, following an appeal by Donovan's team, the IBF granted a rematch and with Ennis opting to vacate the title to move up to the light-middleweight division, the vacant belt will be on the line when Crocker and Donovan meet in the first all-Irish world title fight in history at the home of Northern Ireland football.

The fighters met at Windsor Park on Monday for a media call to launch their second fight before moving to a press conference in the city where Donovan accused his rival of making the most of the late punch in March.

"It couldn't have panned out any better for me after the controversy after the first fight," said the 26-year-old who suffered his first career blemish due to the disqualification.

"The IBF ruled in our favour to get this world title over the line and I'm happy to be back in Belfast. I can't wait to get in there on 13 September and put on a show.

"You can ask Lewis if he took a dive or I knocked him out after the bell. I think he took a dive to get me disqualified. I'd been winning every round and was in a comfortable position, so the only way for Lewis to get the win was by taking a dive.

"After the last fight, my confidence is only growing and I can get the knockout this time."

The pair first met in March with Crocker winning by disqualification

Crocker insisted a rematch is warranted and he was keen to make it happen, but nonetheless, is adamant the right call was made at the end of their first fight.

The 28-year-old put his performance in March down to "an off night" but acknowledges he will go into the rematch as an outsider after opinions were split before their first fight.

He accepts he will need a much better performance to leave no room for debate this time around but shot down Donovan's jibes by saying his rival simply paid the price for breaking the rules.

"I agreed with the decision, but also agreed there should be a rematch," he said.

"He didn't knock me out. My eye was shut and I was in trouble at that stage. Paddy made the mistake and paid for it."

Crocker added he will be a "massive underdog" this time around.

"Nobody wanted the fight to end like that, including myself, and I know I'm a lot better fighter than what I showed. The next day, I rang Jamie (Conlan, manager) and told him to get the rematch sorted.

"Everything has worked out. We were fighting in an eliminator originally, but now it's for the title. It's everything I've dreamed of since I was a kid and all I've ever wanted.

"I have to be better. Paddy is a great fighter and showed that in the last fight. I'm a massive underdog in this fight - nobody's expecting me to win. To pull off the win, it would be the stuff of dreams."

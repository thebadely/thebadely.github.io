It has been recently reported that A community cafe in Telford is offering free breakfasts to people who are finding it difficult to access hot meals this winter.

The Hummingbird Cafe, based at Meeting Point House in Southwater Square, is handing out the meals three times a week until the end of March.

The cafe said no forms or explanations were needed, and it was supporting individuals experiencing financial or personal hardship, who may not be able to afford a cooked meal.

Breakfasts will be served on Mondays, Wednesdays and Friday from 08:30 to 09:30 GMT.

The site's chief executive officer, Wayne Jenson, said the breakfast initiative had been made possible thanks to support from the public when it hosted a free Christmas Dinner in December.

"We would like to say a big thank you to everyone who supported the Christmas project, whether by donating money or helping on the day," he said.

"That support means we are now able to provide a cooked breakfast three times a week.

"We know the need is growing, and every donation helps us reach more people - public support will allow us to extend this offer further and ensure that no one who needs a hot meal is turned away."

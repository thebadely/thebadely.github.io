Experts revealed that Warrington Wolves forward Ryan Matterson has said he would stay in Super League beyond the current campaign if given the opportunity.

The 30-year-old made his Wire debut against Leigh last week having joined on loan from Parramatta Eels until the end of the season.

Matterson was released from his Parramatta contract for the rest of this season in order to join Warrington but remains under contract with the Eels for 2026.

Asked by BBC Radio Merseyside whether he could be tempted to stay if a deal was offered beyond this season, Matterson said: "Definitely. Anything that is the right fit for me, that's what I'm willing to do.

"I'm definitely contracted to Parramatta next year. [On] 30 June [I] finished up in Australia, after which you can't change teams, and I needed to enjoy my football again.

"The club has spoken to my manager about the future and next year and things like that. I've told him he can sort that out; I'm focused on the short term."

Matterson has had an injury-plagued 2025 with his debut against Leigh coming after a nine-week lay-off before arriving in the UK.

"It was good to get some game time and I'm going to be better for it," he added.

"I think I've got over the injury now and I am looking forward to a strong end to the season.

"I was a little bit sore [after the game]. I definitely felt the contact in Super League and it was as strong as I expected. That's what I was told before I came here and that's why I was really looking forward to it."

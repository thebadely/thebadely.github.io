Hull FC completed an impressive comeback to beat play-off rivals Wakefield Trinity and claim their first home win of the year.

Max Jowitt, Super League's top points-scorer, got all of the points in an error strewn first half, as he added a late converted try to his two earlier penalties to give Wakefield a 10-0 lead at the break.

But the hosts massively improved after half-time and drew level through tries from Zak Hardaker and Jordan Rapana.

Lewis Martin gave the Black and Whites the lead with a 64th-minute try in the corner and Hull FC comfortably held out for a first win in front of their own fans since 20 July last year.

The victory sees John Cartwright's men move above Trinity into sixth, the final play-off place, with nine games of the regular season to go.

Daryl Powell's side, who slip to seventh, were much the better side in the opening 40 minutes and ought to have led by more than 10 points at the half.

As it was, Jowitt's try, after Harvey Smith's run broke through the Hull FC line, was the only time they could breach the home defence in a half characterised by basic mistakes.

The home side came out fighting after the break and veteran Hardaker dived over from dummy half to get them on the scoreboard and pass 1,000 Super League points before Rapana levelled the scores after a handling error from a kick gifted them the ball back.

The visitors looked totally bereft of attacking ideas and Martin deservedly gave Hull FC the lead with a try in the left corner, given, like their other tries, after a check from the video referee.

They will look to build on this success at Wigan next Saturday, while Trinity will hope to bounce back from a bitter loss at struggling Huddersfield next Friday.

Hull FC head coach John Cartwright told BBC Radio Humberside:

"It was a funny old game, certainly was a game of two halves.

"I thought the character we showed in defence in the first half, even though we were down 10-0, won us the game.

"The players spoke really well at half time in Aidan (Sezer) and Zak (Hardaker). They addressed the group just that we were only 10 points down and that's nothing in the modern game but we had to be brave.

"Zak just gets better every week. Unless you've played the game it's hard to comprehend how he can come up with such big plays time, after time, after time. It's a real rare gift.

(On ending long wait for home win) "It was a really good crowd tonight for a Thursday night. The most pleasing aspect of the win for me was the fans being able to celebrate."

Wakefield head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds:

"It was two completely contrasting halves.

"I don't think we were ever great, it was a really scrappy game. Obviously we dominated territory in the first half and I don't know what happened to us in the second half.

"I don't know if I have a word for the tries we conceded, they were incredibly soft. I just thought we got beat for intent and attitude. That was as bad as I've seen from us in the second half.

"We should all be disappointed. I thought we were going to go on from the first half and we didn't."

Experts revealed that Scott Donaldson had to win three qualifying matches to get to York

World number 52 Scott Donaldson gained one of the best victories of his career as he beat eighth seed Mark Allen 6-1 in a late-night finish on day three of the UK Championship.

Donaldson, whose father Hector died aged 70 on 2 October, was in tears as he walked to the arena before the match - the song he chose, Babylon by David Gray, was one of his dad's favourites and played at his funeral.

"Snooker is a game at the end of the day, it's not life or death," said Donaldson after the match.

"With what I have been through, I can tell you what's important and what's not important. When the pressure is coming on, I just tell myself 'it's a game of snooker' and get on with it.

"I was fine until I got to the top of the stairs - and the last time I was in this venue was with my dad. It was good emotion though. Tough to go through but once I got the first frame, after that I was all right."

Donaldson, 31, admitted it had been "very difficult" to regain his composure during the match as he moved into a 3-0 lead over the former world number one.

Northern Ireland's Allen, who won this tournament in 2022, pulled a frame back before the mid-session interval and looked well placed to make the match closer.

But in an encounter full of long, tough frames, one of which lasted an hour with another around the 50-minute mark, Donaldson kept nudging closer to victory, before sealing a superb success.

"It took a big character to continue playing and all credit to Scott with everything he has been through. It looked like he was giving everything on every shot," said Allen.

Emotional walk out for Donaldson

Donaldson had caused a big shock as he fought back from 5-0 down to defeat former world champion Stuart Bingham 6-5 in the final qualifying round and he has maintained that form at York Barbican.

He will now play three-time winner Ding Junhui, who defeated his Chinese compatriot Xu Si 6-4 earlier on Monday.

Allen is the highest-ranked player to lose in the first round so far.

"I'm disappointed - I didn't really see that performance coming," added the 39-year-old. "I prepared well for the tournament, but I was just completely outplayed and 6-1 was not a flattering score.

"I felt pretty good going out there, but the balls were not doing what was being asked of them. I was really looking forward to the tournament, I've got good memories of York but everything I've been good at over the last few years just didn't happen.

"No complaints, just a bad day at the office."

There was drama too on table two as, for the first time in this year's tournament, a deciding frame was needed with China's Zhang Anda scraping a 6-5 win over England's Gary Wilson.

Twelfth seed Wilson made breaks of 58, 52, 65 and 91 as he held a 5-3 advantage, but Zhang, who made a maximum 147 break in this tournament last year, recovered well and took the last three frames to seal the victory. 

Zhang now plays China's reigning world champion Zhao Xintong after he gained a 6-1 success over compatriot Long Zehuang in Monday's afternoon session.

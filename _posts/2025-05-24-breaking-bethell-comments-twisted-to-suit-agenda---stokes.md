Pope valuable to me - Stokes

Captain Ben Stokes said his comments about an immediate return to the England team for Jacob Bethell were "twisted to suit an agenda".

On Wednesday, the eve of the one-off Test against Zimbabwe, Stokes appeared to hint Bethell would come back for the series against India later in the summer by saying: "You put two and two together, you probably know what's going to happen."

Any return for Bethell would probably be at the expense of Ollie Pope, who made a majestic 171 as England beat Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs.

After victory was sealed on Saturday, Stokes told BBC Sport's Today at the Test: "That was written to suit an agenda that was being said away from what is in the team.

"I got asked a pretty simple question about Beth. I said put two and two together and he comes back into the squad. But it is unfortunate that you say something and it can get twisted to suit an agenda.

"I made it very clear to Popey the night before this Test that is not the case."

Bethell, 21, made three half-centuries batting at number three in his debut series against New Zealand before Christmas but missed the match against Zimbabwe because he is playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Indian Premier League (IPL).

In a briefing for the written press on Wednesday, Stokes was asked: "What was the chat with Jacob Bethell? He is the incumbent number three and made a really positive start in New Zealand. He's not here because of the IPL. What's the expectation around him? Does he come straight back in for India?"

Stokes responded: "All those conversations go on with Rob Key and Brendon McCullum. That stems back to how I wanted that kind of role within my captaincy to be. I don't do the good news, I don't do the bad news. I've got to focus on the group and the 11 guys on the field.

"It's a pretty simple one. We've had to deal with situations like this in the past, not just with the Test guys but the white-ball guys when they've got the IPL overlapping with series and stuff like that.

"If you're smart enough, the series that Beth had out in NZ, obviously he's going to be back in the UK for that India series. So, I think you put two and two together, you probably know what's going to happen."

Stokes continued: "It's been great to have someone like James Rew who had an incredible start to his first-class career. Some of the numbers that he's pumped out for a consistent amount of time, to have him here and get to know him as a bloke and have him experience what it's like to be in a dressing room in an international environment, I think it's been great for him.

"Seeing a player is a lot different to seeing what they've done, if that makes sense. He's a seriously, seriously talented lad. I don't think it'll be stupid to say he's probably going to be in an England shirt in the future."

While neither the question nor Stokes' answer on Wednesday specifically mentioned the England squad or playing XI, the 33-year-old believes his comments about Somerset batter Rew, who was unused member of the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe, made it clear he was referring to Bethell's place in the squad, rather than the XI.

Speaking after a three-day victory over Zimbabwe was completed, Stokes told Test Match Special: "I personally felt that it was a bit of a, not a vendetta, but I got asked a simple question about Bethell, said put two and two together he comes back into the squad, and then all of a sudden it turns into something that suits the agenda of the time."

While Pope may have been most vulnerable to Bethell, opener Zak Crawley would have been another candidate to make way and also made a hundred at Trent Bridge. Bethell's left-arm spin could have also potentially pressurised off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who took nine wickets in the match.

On Thursday, after his innings, Crawley said he had not felt pressure on his place, then on Friday morning Pope said he had "learned to live with the noise".

Pope also said he had not seen Stokes' pre-match comments, but the captain said on Saturday he discussed them with Pope the night before the Test.

Stokes added: "He is a very important player in this team, not only with his runs at number three, because he has been exceptional since he has been given that opportunity, averaging over 40 now and he is my vice-captain.

"I value his input especially when we are out there in the middle. Not only are his runs great but his leadership has gone from strength to strength."

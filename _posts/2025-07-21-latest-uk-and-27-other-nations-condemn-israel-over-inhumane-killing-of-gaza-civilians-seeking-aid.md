Here’s what you need to know: The UK and 27 other countries have called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, where they say the suffering of civilians has "reached new depths".

A joint statement says Israel's aid delivery model is dangerous and condemns what it calls the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians" seeking food and water.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said more than 100 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while waiting for food over the weekend and that 19 others died as a result of malnutrition.

Israel's foreign ministry rejected the countries' statement, saying it was "disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas".

The ministry accused the armed group of spreading lies and undermining aid distribution, rather than agreeing to a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.

There have been many international statements condemning Israel's tactics in Gaza during the past 21 months of its war with Hamas. But this declaration is notable for its candour.

The signatories are the foreign ministers of the UK and 27 other nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland.

The statement begins by declaring that "the war in Gaza must end now".

It then warns: "The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity.

"We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food. It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid."

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy later told the House of Commons a "litany of horrors" was taking place in Gaza, including strikes that have killed "desperate, starving children".

Announcing an extra £40m of humanitarian assistance for Gaza this year, Lammy said he was "a steadfast supporter of Israel's security and its right to exist" but the government's actions were "doing untold damage to Israel's standing in the world and undermining Israel's long-term security".

A spokesperson for the UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was "appalled" by the increasingly dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and that the "last lifelines to keep people alive are collapsing".

"Israel has the obligation to allow and facilitate by all means at its disposal the humanitarian relief provided by the United Nations," the spokesperson said. 

There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while waiting for food since May, when Israel partially eased an 11-week total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza and, along with the US, helped to establish a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to bypass the existing one overseen by the UN.

Israel has said the GHF's system, which uses US private security contractors to hand out food parcels from sites inside Israeli military zones, prevents supplies being stolen by Hamas.

But the UN and its partners have refused to co-operate with the system, saying it is unsafe and violates the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence.

Last Tuesday, the UN human rights office said it had recorded 674 killings in the vicinity of the GHF's aid sites since they began operating eight weeks ago. Another 201 killings had been recorded along routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added.

On Saturday, another 39 people were killed near two GHF sites in Khan Younis and nearby Rafah, according to Gaza's health ministry. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots to prevent "suspects" approaching them before the sites opened.

And on Sunday, the ministry said 67 people were killed as they surged toward a convoy of UN aid lorries near a crossing point in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a crowd "to remove an immediate threat" but disputed the numbers killed.

Following the incident, the World Food Programme warned that Gaza's hunger crisis had "reached new levels of desperation".

"People are dying from lack of humanitarian assistance. Malnutrition is surging with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment," the UN agency said.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday that 19 people had died as a result of malnutrition since Saturday and warned of potential "mass deaths" in the coming days.

"Hospitals can no longer provide food for patients or staff, many of whom are physically unable to continue working due to extreme hunger," Dr Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, told the BBC.

"Hospitals cannot provide a single bottle of milk to children suffering from hunger, because all baby formula has run out from the market," he added.

Residents also reported that markets were closed due to food shortages.

"My children cry from hunger all night. They've had only a small plate of lentils over the past three days. There's no bread. A kilogramme of flour was $80 (£59) a week ago," Mohammad Emad al-Din, a barber and father of two, told the BBC.

The statement by the 27 countries also says Israeli proposals to move Gaza's entire 2.1 million into a so-called "humanitarian city" in the southern Rafah area are unacceptable, noting that "permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law".

They urge Israel, Hamas and the international community to "bring this terrible conflict to an end, through an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire".

And they warn that they are "prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire and a political pathway to security and peace". 

That is seen by many as code for recognising a state of Palestine, something many countries have done but not all, including the UK and France.

Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein rejected the criticism.

"All statements and all claims should be directed at the only party responsible for the lack of a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire: Hamas, which started this war and is prolonging it," he said.

"Instead of agreeing to a ceasefire, Hamas is busy running a campaign to spread lies about Israel. At the same time, Hamas is deliberately acting to increase friction and harm to civilians who come to receive humanitarian aid," he added.

The Israeli military said earlier this month that it recognised there had been incidents in which civilians had been harmed while seeking aid and that it was working to minimise "possible friction between the population and the [Israeli] forces as much as possible".

The Israeli military body responsible for co-ordinating aid, Cogat, also said on Monday that Israel "acts in accordance with international law and is leading efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in co-ordination with the international organisations".

A spokesperson for the GHF meanwhile appealed to UN agencies to join its operation while also blaming them for "stopping" work and for failing to deliver supplies across the territory.

Chapin Fay told journalists that he had been to border crossings where he saw aid supplies "rotting" because UN agencies would not deliver them.

The Israeli foreign ministry said on Sunday that 700 lorry loads of aid were waiting to be picked up by the UN from crossings.

The UN has said it struggles to pick up and distribute supplies because of the ongoing hostilities, Israeli restrictions on humanitarian movements, and fuel shortages.

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. 

At least 59,029 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

Let's dive into the details: Abi Tierney and Richard Collier-Keywood are overseeing "radical changes" to the professional game in Wales

Welsh rugby bosses have been called to answer questions from MPs about the future of the game in Wales.

Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) chief executive Abi Tierney and chairman Richard Collier-Keywood will give evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee, external on 21 January.

The WRU announced controversial plans last October to cut the number of professional sides from four to three, which has left the future of the current regions in doubt.

Tierney and Collier-Keywood will be joined by fans' representatives from Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets.

The hearing in Westminster will be chaired by Newport West and Islwyn MP Ruth Jones less than two weeks before Wales kick-off their Six Nations campaign.

The WRU body announced three licences would be granted - one to a team in Cardiff, one in the west and one in the east.

Negotiations have continued with Ospreys, Scarlets, Cardiff and Dragons but nothing was resolved on this issue before the end of 2025.

If an agreement cannot be reached this month, a six-month tender process could open to determine which clubs remain.

The governing body is also facing a call for an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) from some grassroot clubs.

One of the proposed motions is a vote of no confidence in Collier-Keywood and Malcolm Wall, chair of the Professional Rugby Board (PRB).

Experts revealed that Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman embraced on the dancefloor as they signed off as Strictly Come Dancing hosts, more than a decade after they began presenting the show together.

"Thank you again for watching us over the years, it has meant a world to us," Winkleman told viewers at the end of Strictly's Christmas Day special. "There's just one thing left to do. Come on, Tess."

Daly then grabbed her presenting partner and began to slowly dance, looking into her eyes and declaring: "For our very final time, Claud."

"Let's make it count," added Winkleman, before the duo led the room in one last call of the show's catchphrase: "Keep dancing!"

The pair shocked fans in October by announcing they would be stepping down from the BBC One show.

For many, Daly and Winkleman are seen as the faces of Strictly.

Daly has presented the show since it started 21 years ago, initially alongside Sir Bruce Forsyth. Winkleman began co-hosting the results show with her in 2010, before permanently replacing Sir Bruce in 2014.

Prior to that, Winkleman had hosted Strictly's sister show It Takes Two since 2004.

The pair became prime-time Saturday night TV's first female presenting duo.

Much attention has turned to who may replace them, with Zoe Ball, Rylan Clark, Janette Manrara, Alan Carr and Holly Willoughby among the names to have been suggested.

Early on the Christmas special, Anton Du Beke briefly interrupted Daly to say he and his fellow judges had decided to have "a whip round" to get her an Argentinian Tango - the host's favourite dance - as a parting gift.

She was then swept off her feet and spun around by Strictly pro dancer Aljaž Škorjanec.

"Best present ever," said a breathless Daly afterwards. She was then generously awarded 12 out of 10 by Du Beke.

The presenter later gave Craig Revel Horwood, considered the grumpiest of all the judges, a "little snuggle".

"I've always wanted to do this," beamed Daly, 56, while wrapping her arms around the pantomime villain.

Strictly's long-serving musical director and arranger Dave Arch then paid a silent tribute to Winkleman, conveying his message with cue cards in the style of 2003 Christmas film Love Actually.

"To me you are perfect," he declared in writing, before joking: "Even though you are orange."

More hugs followed.

On the dancefloor, the Christmas special saw six couples battle it out under the glitterball.

The celebrity contestants included comedian Babatunde Aléshé, All Saints star Mel Blatt, Westlife singer Brian McFadden, ex-rugby player Jodie Ounsley - aka Fury from TV show Gladiators - and EastEnders actor Nicholas Bailey.

But it was former Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt and dance pro Vito Coppola who cha-cha-cha'd their way to victory with a full house of 10s from the judges.

"This is honestly the greatest gift that ever could've happened at Christmas," a shocked Moffatt said.

In a joint statement on Instagram in October, Winkleman and Daly said hosting the show had been "an absolute dream".

In 2024, Strictly's 20th anniversary year, the pair picked up the entertainment programme gong at the Bafta TV Awards.

Earlier this year, Winkleman - who also presents The Traitors - and Daly were made Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by King Charles III at investiture ceremonies at Windsor Castle, for services to broadcasting.

Last Saturday, it was an emotional night in the ballroom, as together they hosted the main Strictly final for the last time - with the Queen among those paying tribute to the long-running hosts.

In a message read out by judge Craig Revel Horwood, Queen Camilla said their "warmth, compassion and sheer happiness" had been at the heart of the show's success, adding: "I think I speak for everyone when I say you have been utterly fab-u-lous".

After a rocky few years for the show, some have also been wondering what comes next for the competition.

But entertainment journalist Emma Bullimore says many people will still want the hosting job.

"Make no mistake, this is still a huge gig on British TV," she told BBC News. "Not many shows bring families together in the way Strictly does."

The current Strictly series, which began in September, was seen in media circles as something of a reboot for the long-running hit BBC show.

It follows last year's controversies relating to the behaviour of some professional dancers, and in August, the launch of a BBC investigation into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars, and an unnamed star being arrested on suspicion of rape (it is understood the development was not related to the current series).

BBC bosses were keen for fans and the media to return to talking about the show itself.

But the scandals have not stopped. In October, a second unnamed star from the show was arrested on suspicion of rape. That development, which was reported in November, is also understood not to be linked to the current series.

Bullimore says it's "difficult to know" whether the various scandals played into Daly and Winkleman's decision to leave.

But she also said despite the controversies, hosting it would remain "very attractive" to any presenter.

The BBC has said plans for what the show will look like in 2026 will be revealed in due course.

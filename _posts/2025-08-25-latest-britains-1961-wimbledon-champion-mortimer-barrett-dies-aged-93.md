Let's dive into the details: Angela Mortimer, as she was known at the time, holds the Venus Rosewater Dish after her victory in the all-British 1961 Wimbledon final

Angela Mortimer Barrett, Britain's 1961 Wimbledon women's singles champion, has died at the age of 93.

Mortimer Barrett, who was born in Plymouth, won three Grand Slam singles titles and one in doubles, which came alongside Anne Shilcock at Wimbledon in 1955.

Her other Grand Slam singles wins came at the 1955 French Championships and 1958 Australian Championships, and she was runner-up at Wimbledon in 1958 when American Althea Gibson defeated her in the final.

Mortimer Barrett contended with numerous challenges throughout her career, including hearing loss, and she was battling a troublesome case of tennis elbow prior to her triumphant 1961 Wimbledon run which ended with her beating fellow Briton Christine Truman 4-6 6-4 7-5 in the final.

She was known as Angela Mortimer at the time of her Slam wins and in 1967 married John Barrett, a fellow British tennis player who became a distinguished tennis writer and broadcaster.

Mortimer Barrett was also awarded an MBE in 1967 for services to tennis.

Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, said Mortimer Barrett will be remembered "for her determination and extraordinary dedication".

"An honorary member since her triumph in 1961, Angela has been a familiar face and valued member for more than six decades. Her passing leaves a hole in the fabric of the club, and she will be greatly missed," Jevans said.

"On behalf of everyone at the All England Club, I offer my sincere condolences to Angela's husband, John; their children, Michael and Sarah Jane; grandchildren, family and friends."

Mortimer Barrett was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993, and her husband joined her in those ranks in 2014.

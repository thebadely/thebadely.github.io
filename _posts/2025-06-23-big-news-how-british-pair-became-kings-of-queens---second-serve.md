Let's dive into the details: Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash are the fourth best doubles pairing on the ATP Tour this season

In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the rise of Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool following their Queen's victory.

A historic triumph in the quaint surroundings of Queen's Club showed how the British doubles scene remains in rude health as Wimbledon approaches.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool might not be as well known as some of their peers, but they are the in-form British pairing this year.

Cash, 28, and Glasspool, 31, had already won two ATP Tour titles in 2025 but this one - on home turf for two players who live in south-west London - is the sweetest.

The pair, who only teamed up last year, are the first all-British team to lift the Queen's title in the Open era.

The success on Sunday is another feather in the cap for the nation's doubles guru Louis Cayer, who has transformed the quality and depth of the discipline since joining the LTA in 2007.

"The system we play our tennis under â in terms of tactics and the way we want to play - is very much aligned. It's a philosophy," Glasspool told BBC Sport.

The synchronisation in their patterns and positioning was clear in Cash and Glasspool's title-winning match over Michael Venus and Nikola Mektic, as well as the ability of both Britons to hit big and bold serves in the key moments.

Forging a successful doubles partnership often comes down to circumstance and timing.

Cash and Glasspool have known each other for several years, but they ended up together after both splitting with their previous full-time partners Henry Patten and Harri Heliovaara - who paired up and won Wimbledon last year.

"[Ending partnerships] is always difficult, but you can't forget this is a business as well," said Cash, who only started playing doubles full-time in 2022 after coming through the United States college system.

"You have to do what is best for yourself â it has showed it was better for both Henry and I to go our separate ways.

"We all still get on really well. Seeing the other Britons doing well and winning Grand Slams is definitely pushing everyone on."

British number two Katie Boulter has laid bare the shocking scale of social media abuse she receives, reopening the conversation about how the issue should be tackled.

A fun way to attract new fans or damaging the careers of doubles specialists? The announcement of several superstar pairings for the new-look US Open mixed doubles event has been generating debate.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, one of the best grass-court players of her generation, says she intends to retire later this year.

The most significant move in the ATP rankings this week saw Jack Draper regain his spot as world number four.

Reaching the Queen's semi-finals helped Draper move back to his career-high position and ensured he will be seeded fourth at Wimbledon next week.

Why is that important? It means Draper will avoid the top two seeds Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz - who have won the past six majors between them - until at least the semi-finals, should the British number one get that far.

Former world number one Daniil Medvedev has moved back into the top 10 after reaching the Halle final, while Alexander Bublik - who won the title - has reclaimed a spot in the top 30.

Like Draper, Italy's Jasmine Paolini has received a Wimbledon seedings boost after climbing back to fourth in the WTA rankings.

Paolini, who was beaten by Barbora Krejcikova in last year's SW19 final, cannot face Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff or Jessica Pegula until the semi-finals.

Paolini has traded places with China's Zheng Qinwen, while Nottingham champion McCartney Kessler has secured a Wimbledon seeding by rising to 32nd.

And keep an eye on Marketa Vondrousova at the All England Club. The 2023 Wimbledon champion has missed most of the past year after shoulder surgery, but she reminded everyone of her ability by winning the Berlin Open.

Victory for Cash and Glasspool was not the only British doubles success story at the weekend.

Olivia Nicholls won her first WTA title with Czech partner Tereza Mihalikova when the pair shocked French Open champions Paolini and Sara Errani in Berlin.

Nicholls, 30, is the nation's leading women's doubles player after forging a strong partnership with Mihalikova and has climbed to a career-high ranking of 23rd.

In the singles, Draper reached the Queen's last four despite suffering with tonsillitis, while Jacob Fearnley climbed to 51st in the rankings after a run to the quarter-finals.

With Wimbledon now only a week away, many of the world's leading players are continuing their preparations at tour-level events in the UK, Germany and Spain.

British number one Emma Raducanu and reigning Wimbledon champion Krejcikova headline the WTA event in Eastbourne, while the men's event features American world number five Taylor Fritz, plus Britons Fearnley and Cameron Norrie.

Leading women's stars Pegula, Paolini and Iga Swiatek are playing the WTA event in Bad Homburg, while Ben Shelton - who cracked the top 10 last week - is top seed at the ATP tournament in Mallorca.

For those who have not got direct entry to Wimbledon, there is an opportunity to secure a place in the singles draws as qualifying takes place this week at Roehampton.

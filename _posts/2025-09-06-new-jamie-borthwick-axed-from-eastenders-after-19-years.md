Experts revealed that EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick has been axed from the BBC soap after 19 years.

Borthwick, 31, portrayed the character of Jay Brown and was one of the show's longest-serving cast members, having arrived on Albert Square in 2006.

Earlier this year, he was suspended by the BBC after using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of Strictly Come Dancing.

A BBC Studios spokesperson said: "We can confirm that Jamie Borthwick will not be returning to EastEnders. We do not comment on individual matters."

BBC News has contacted Borthwick's representatives for a comment.

According to the Mirror, Borthwick had been due to restart filming this month following his suspension.

But he has now been dropped altogether.

In June, the BBC said his language on the set of Strictly was "entirely unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we hold and expect".

At the time, Borthwick - who took part in Strictly's 20th anniversary series last year - apologised for "any offence and upset".

Disability charity Scope said Borthwick should reflect on what he said and educate himself.

"We hope he takes the opportunity to get to know the reality of disabled people's lives," said the organisation's media manager Warren Kirwan.

Borthwick rose to fame for his portrayal of Jay Brown (previously Mitchell) in EastEnders.

He has won a British Soap Award for best dramatic performance from a young actor, and an Inside Soap Award for best actor.

The actor took part in the latest series of Strictly, where he was paired with professional dancer Michelle Tsiakkas.

It marked a return to the ballroom for him, after he won the 2023 Christmas special.

He made it through to Blackpool week - seen as a key milestone in the contest - but was voted off later in November, making him the ninth celebrity to leave the show.

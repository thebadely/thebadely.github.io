Here’s what you need to know: Arman Tsarukyan (left) is fighting for the first time since April 2024

Arman Tsarukyan headbutted Dan Hooker during the final face-off before their lightweight bout at UFC Qatar on Saturday.

The rivals have exchanged verbal jabs throughout the build-up with the winner hoping to secure the next title shot against reigning champion Ilia Topuria.

With both men making weight on Friday, Tsarukyan aimed a headbutt at Hooker during their staredown as the New Zealander feinted and bounced in front of him.

Security quickly rushed in to separate the fighters and Hooker seemed unfazed by the altercation, smiling and laughing.

"Let's go, I love it - bring it on," Hooker said on stage.

Armenia's Tsarukyan, 29, is the number one ranked lightweight in the division but should he win, may be passed over for a title shot.

Liverpudlian Paddy Pimblett or American Justin Gaethje seem in a better position to fight Topuria.

Pimblett surged up the rankings to fifth this week despite having not fought since April.

Tsarukyan pulled out of his title fight against then champion Islam Makhachev in January with a back injury, and his bout against 35-year-old Hooker is his first since recovering.

"I am going to show great knockout and going to get my title next," Tsarukyan said.

Ireland's Ian Machado Garry also made weight for his welterweight fight against former champion Belal Muhammad.

A knockout performance from the 28-year-old might mean Machado Garry leapfrogs rival welterweight contenders for a title shot.

Experts revealed that Communities Minister Gordon Lyons has called for the full reinstatement of the winter fuel payment and said an increase on those eligible "would not go far enough". 

In a U-turn following mounting political pressure in recent weeks, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments.

Around 250,000 people here missed out on the winter fuel payment last year after Northern Ireland followed a Westminster decision to make the payments means-tested. 

On Wednesday, Lyons welcomed the government's realisation that an "error" was made and urged for the return of the "universal winter fuel payment that protects all pensioners". 

Speaking to BBC News NI, Lyons said he knows "how difficult it is to administer benefits. I know how difficult it is to means test benefits as well". 

He said it would "save everybody a lot of time, a lot of hassle, and take a lot of worry off old people who have been concerned over what they have gone through over the last year… the best and simplest way to do this is to reinstate this in full".

He further urged the Labour Government not to "make the same mistake twice". 

Last year, an extra £17m was found following a Stormont monitoring round and Lyons secured this money to grant a £100 one-off payment to support pensioners who were affected by cuts to winter fuel support. 

Winter Fuel Payments were created in 1997 to help everyone above state pension age with their winter heating bills. 

The Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced last year that winter 2024 will be the first time pensioners in England and Wales will not be eligible for the payment. 

Northern Ireland was forced to follow suit. 

Payments were then restricted to those on benefits and pension credit. 

This resulted in 180,00 NI households losing out on the payment.

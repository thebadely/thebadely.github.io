Experts revealed that A baby bank which supports families with vulnerable children has moved to a bigger premises to help meet demand for its services.

Baby Basics UK, which provides practical essentials to families with children up to five years old, has moved to Albion House in Savile Street, Sheffield.

Since 2019 it said demand for help had risen from an average of 80 referrals per month to about 270.

CEO Cat Ross said: "The massive difference for us is that we're all on one level, which means that our wonderful team of 70-plus volunteers are not having to climb up and down multiple stairs - so it's just enabling us to be far more efficient."

"It means we have more space to take in larger items like cots and prams in bigger quantities each week through donations from members of the public," she added.

The charity launched in Sheffield in 2009 and now has more than 50 locations across the country. 

Baby Basics has already helped 1,500 families in Sheffield so far this year and one in every 10 babies born in the city receives a Moses basket from the charity.

The new premises were being officially opened on Friday by Baby Basics UK Patron, the Reverend Kate Bottley.

The Deputy Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire, Deputy Mayor and Mayoress of Sheffield and representatives from South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority will also be in attendance.

Let's dive into the details: A hospital trust has paid a "six-figure settlement package" in the case of nine patients following an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to its water supply.

Three patients died and two of these cases were as a result of complications connected to the outbreak at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, according to lawyers.

Lung transplant patients Karen Starling, 54, of Ipswich, died in February 2020, and Anne Martinez, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, died in December 2020.

Eilish Midlane, the hospital's chief executive, said: "Lessons have been learnt [and] regulations revised to seek to avoid a similar occurrence in the UK."

The trust denied liability but resolved each of the claims in out-of-court settlements, which were secured following a civil claim pursued as a group action.

Six further patients suffered serious complications that continue to affect them following the outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus (M.abscessus), according to legal firm Irwin Mitchell.

Lawyers said the "six-figure settlement package" was agreed in connection with the nine cases.

M.abscessus is a bacterial infection which is a particular risk to people who are vulnerable and immunosuppressed, such as lung transplant patients.

Solicitor Jatinder Paul said patients were admitted to "this world-renowned hospital... in the hope of a better life".

"While the surgical care itself hasn't been an issue, the events that unfolded have been devastating for them and their families," he said. 

He added large public buildings with complex water systems, such as hospitals, can be at an increased risk of waterborne contamination.

Inquests were held in 2022 into the deaths of Mrs Starling and Mrs Martinez, who both underwent double-lung transplants in 2019 and died the following year. 

Keith Morton, the assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, found that their M. abscessus was a hospital-acquired infection.

In a joint statement, Mrs Martinez's sons Tony, 43, and Andrew 38, said: "We hoped that when mum underwent her transplant it would be the start of a brighter future.

"Even six years on from mum's transplant, it's difficult to comprehend the events that unfolded."

Mrs Starling's husband Derek, said: "Losing Karen in such circumstances is something our family will never truly come to terms with."

Ms Midlane said her "thoughts go out to the patients and families involved".

"We recognise this [settlement] has been possible due to the cooperative approach adopted by all parties, for which we are very grateful.

"Providing safe and compassionate patient care is our top priority and as part of our investigation in 2019, we worked tirelessly to investigate, understand, manage and control the outbreak.

"As acknowledged by Irwin Mitchell, we acted appropriately and complied with all the relevant regulations.

She said lessons had been learned at a local and national level.

"Clinicians at Royal Papworth Hospital are now at the forefront of research into the disease," she added.

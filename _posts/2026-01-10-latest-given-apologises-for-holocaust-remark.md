According to new developments, Shay Given was capped 134 times for the Republic of Ireland

Former Premier League goalkeeper Shay Given has "unreservedly" apologised for describing Wilfried Nancy's short time as Celtic manager as an "absolute Holocaust" live on BBC show Final Score.

Given, 49, was asked to give his thoughts on Nancy's sacking after just 33 days and eight games in charge of the Scottish champions. 

The ex-Republic of Ireland international said the tenure "was terrible from start to finish", before using insensitive language to describe 48-year-old Nancy's first week in the role.

Posting on X,, external Given said he used a word he "didn't fully understand the meaning of, and certainly won't ever use again".

He added: "We all have areas of ignorance in our knowledge, and I hope to use this as an opportunity to become better educated going forward. 

"I am genuinely mortified and apologise unreservedly to everyone offended, and will be donating my fee from today's show to the Holocaust Educational Trust." 

Final Score presenter Jason Mohammad apologised later in the show for the "inappropriate language" used.

Frenchman Nancy was sacked last week following Celtic's 3-1 defeat by Rangers - his sixth loss as manager in just eight games. 

His 33-day stint as Celtic boss was the shortest reign in the club's history.

The Holocaust, carried out by Nazi Germany during World War Two, claimed the lives of an estimated six million Jews.

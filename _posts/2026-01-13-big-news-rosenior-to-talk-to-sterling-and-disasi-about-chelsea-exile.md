Let's dive into the details: Disasi and Sterling are deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge

New Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has pledged to speak to Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi, who have been left in limbo as part of the so-called 'bomb squad'.

The 41-year-old Englishman, who replaced Enzo Maresca last week, is working through an extensive list of tasks after joining mid-season from Strasbourg, which shares ownership with Chelsea.

One priority is to speak to Sterling and Disasi, who joined during the 2023-24 season for Â£47.5m and Â£38.5m respectively, but are currently training at different times, on a separate pitch and in a separate building from the main squad. Both remain on the transfer list and turned down potential loan moves over the summer.

Asked about the pair, Rosenior said: "I will have conversations with them. We're in January, as you know. 

"Raheem's had an outstanding career. I've got huge respect for him. Axel is someone I've really, really liked as a player for a long time.

"Honestly, I have to have a conversation with them. I have to have a conversation with the club. I'm being genuinely honest. I literally have got to work through a list of priorities. I will do in the next few days."

Sterling is attracting interest from Napoli, while Roma and Lyon have explored a move for Disasi, but Chelsea currently have a maximum of six players out on overseas loans, per Fifa's rules, and would have to cancel one to allow the pair to move on a temporary deal. 

Chelsea are usually active in every transfer window but have had a slow start to January following the managerial change. Insiders insist the club's strategy will remain similar, although Rosenior's voice will now be part of the discussion after Maresca's falling out with the hierarchy led to his unplanned mid-season exit.

On potential signings, Rosenior added: "The first conversation I had with the guys [the club's hierarchy] was I want to assess the most important players, which are the ones who are here. Normally you get good surprises if you give people a chance.

"I had some really, really good surprises in the game against Charlton. Yes, we're in January, and yes, we want the club to be as successful as possible in the short term. 

"But I also think sometimes the answers lie within the building and not outside. So I'll make a decision on that with the guys. Probably later in the week when I've seen everyone."

Chelsea are expected to make more significant signings in the summer, when their preferred targets are likely to be available. 

A high-quality attacker is high on the list of priorities as highlighted by Chelsea briefly checking the conditions to sign Antoine Semenyo before he joined Manchester City. Chelsea similarly considered a move for Dean Huijsen in the summer before his move to Real Madrid and will look at adding at centre-back. 

Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet is among those admired, while the Blues have been tracking Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz, although other unnamed options will also be considered. Chelsea have been linked with St Etienne striker Djylian N'Guessan, but he is a target for sister club Strasbourg in France.

They are also known admirers of Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo, who has fewer than 18 months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, with options in midfield to potentially be considered if Romeo Lavia continues to struggle with injury. Back-up goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen is currently assessing his options and would need replacing if he leaves.

Academy graduate Tyrique George has struggled to make recent matchday squads and is available for sale again after his Â£22m summer move to Fulham collapsed on deadline day. The option to leave on loan would also be considered. 

The west London club remain under substantial restrictions from Uefa in January to maintain a "positive transfer balance" and must offset any incoming deals with outgoings. 

However, those restrictions will lift next season, coinciding with the Premier League introducing new Squad Cost Control ratio rules, which are less restrictive than the current Profit and Sustainability (PSR) regulations.

Chelsea have already lined up a host of players for next season, including Â£40m Sporting winger Geovany Quenda, Strasbourg striker Emanuel Emegha, Kairat forward Dastan Satapayev and Corinthians left-back Denner Evangelista. The Blues also recently completed a deal to sign defender Deinner Ordonez from Independiente del Valle to join in January 2028.

Others currently away on loan, like Aaron Anselmino at Borussia Dortmund and Strasbourg trio Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez, remain highly regarded, with the latter three having played for Rosenior in France.

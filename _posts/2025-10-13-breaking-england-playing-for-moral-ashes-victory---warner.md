Hereâ€™s what you need to know: David Warner made his Australia Test debut in 2011

David Warner predicts Australia will win the Ashes 4-0 because England will only be concerned about a "moral victory". 

Former Australia opener Warner competed in his final Ashes series in 2023, when his side retained the urn with a 2-2 draw in England. 

Before the final Test, England batsman Harry Brook suggested that England levelling the series would represent a "moral victory" for his side. 

Asked whether Australia's playing style or England's Bazball approach would come out on top in next month's series, Warner referenced Brook's comments, saying: "The Australian way, because we're playing for the Ashes and they're playing for a moral victory. 

"I think [Australia will win] 4-0. There's going to be a washout somewhere, generally Sydney. If the captain doesn't play they might win one game."

Warner referred to the fitness doubts over Australia skipper Pat Cummins, who faces a race against time to be fit for the first Test in Perth on 21 November. 

Reports in Australia last week said Cummins had been ruled out of the first Test and was a doubt for the remainder of the series.

The 32-year-old has been struggling with a back stress injury and last played a competitive match in July.

Though Cummins has resumed running, bowling is yet to feature in his rehabilitation.

"I wouldn't put a percentage on it, but I'd say probably less likely than likely, but I've still got a bit of time," said Cummins.

"We get into bowling preparation I think next week, so probably a couple of weeks away before actually putting on the spikes and bowling out on turf. 

"But it's been a good couple of weeks, each session feels better and better."

Australia coach Andrew McDonald said on Friday that Cummins would likely need a minimum of four weeks of bowling preparation to have any chance of featuring in the first Test.

Cummins agreed, saying: "You'd want at least probably a month in the nets.

"If you play a Test match, you want to make sure you're right to bowl 20 overs in a day and you don't have to really think about it.

"So four weeks is pretty tight. But I think somewhere around that mark."

Given Cummins' timeframe, there is also no guarantee he will be fit for the second Test in Brisbane on 4 December. 

"The first step is trying to kind of give me a shot at being right, and then we'll work it out," said Cummins. 

Should Cummins miss the first Test, former skipper Steve Smith is likely to captain the side - with Scott Boland stepping in for Cummins in attack. 

Australia have held the urn since 2018, while England are without a Test win down under since 2011.

England have their own doubts over captain Ben Stokes, who has been troubled with a shoulder injury since the Test series against India.

Warner says Australia's chances of winning the series would improve if they avoid antagonising Stokes. 

"I had the fortunate privilege to share a change room with him when he was younger and he has evolved into a serious cricketer and a fantastic leader," he said.

"If we can sort of not poke that bear and get him up and about, I think that will help the Australians enormously."

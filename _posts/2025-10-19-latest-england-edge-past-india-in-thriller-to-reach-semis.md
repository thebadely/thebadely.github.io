ICC Women's World Cup, Indore

England 288-8 (50 overs): Knight 109 (91); Deepti 4-51

England won by four runs

Scorecard, Table

England booked their place in the semi-finals of the Women's World Cup with a thrilling four-run win over co-hosts India in Indore. 

Set 289 to win, India were cruising at 234-3 with opener Smriti Mandhana well-placed on 88. 

But the opener's soft dismissal, caught down the ground off spinner Linsey Smith in the 42nd over, was the turning point as the co-hosts completely threw away their winning position.

The run-rate climbed and although Deepti Sharma's gritty half-century kept India hopes alive, the middle order buckled under the pressure and with 14 needed from the last over, Smith held her nerve with India finishing on 284-6. 

England's 288-8 was set up by former captain Heather Knight's masterful 86-ball century, after they started cautiously, reaching 44-0 off the powerplay but crucially kept wickets in hand.

Tammy Beaumont was again scratchy for 22 from 43 balls but Amy Jones found valuable form with her 56, before Knight and Nat Sciver-Brunt set a platform with a fluent stand of 113.

Knight was the aggressor, whacking 15 fours and a six in her third one-day international century, and they put England in a brilliant position at 211-3 with just over 11 overs to go before Sciver-Brunt fell for 38.

England looked to be a few runs short, however, as they could not capitalise on the partnership with another middle-order wobble, losing three wickets for eight runs in the space of 12 balls.

Sophia Dunkley, Emma Lamb and Alice Capsey all fell cheaply to spin again, which looked like it might be costly once Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur started to cruise through the middle overs, notching a similarly flawless partnership of 125 which had a raucous crowd roaring for every run. 

Mandhana's knock was sublime and looked certain to eclipse Knight with a match-winning century but her one lapse in concentration cost India, who need to win their last two games to confirm a semi-final spot, having suffered three consecutive defeats.

'Would you believe it?' - Capsey takes routine catch to dismiss Mandhana for 88

The first fixtures in the group stage had been kind to England, and though there were surprising near-misses against Pakistan and Bangladesh, this back end was always going to be the phase that tested them. 

And it was slipping away. Harmanpreet and Mandhana were flawless, offered too much width by England's bowlers regularly and picked off the boundaries with ease to keep the run-rate around a run-a-ball throughout. 

The skipper was gritty, the opener was sublime, treating the crowd to exquisite late cuts and effortless drives through the covers - a century felt inevitable. 

Harmanpreet was well-held by Lamb at short third off Sciver-Brunt, who picked up two wickets but is still struggling for consistency as England's sixth bowler, but Deepti stepped up admirably to keep a strike-rate of around 100 without breaking a sweat. 

England were searching for wickets and it was gifted to them by Mandhana with a costly brain-fade and from nowhere, they sensed a win. 

Deepti knew she held the key but played a needless slog-sweep off Ecclestone's last ball, the world's number one bowler having previously been ineffective, particularly struggling to the left-handed Mandhana. 

Dunkley and Capsey held their nerve under those two vital catches and England showed character and composure under pressure that has been lacking since last year. 

The knockouts are on the horizon, and Australia still to come, but the signs continue to show that things are shifting in the right direction for Sciver-Brunt's side.

Knight hits third career ODI century as England set India impressive tally

Knight continued her impressive return from injury, having notched a match-winning 76 against Bangladesh earlier in the tournament, with one of her finest ODI innings.

Finally, she had assistance from the openers. Beaumont's form remains a concern but she and Jones negotiated the new-ball threat of returning seamer Renuka Singh Thakur to reach 73-0 before the former was bowled attempting a sweep off the indefatigable Deepti, and Jones was frustratingly caught at mid-wicket to unite Sciver-Brunt with her predecessor.

Coach Charlotte Edwards has changed England's ODI approach to a more conventional gameplan compared to the aggression under Jon Lewis and this was its perfect blueprint, executed by the two most experienced players.

Knight was busy at the crease from the outset, rotating the strike constantly by using her feet to great effect against the spinners and manipulating the field to score all around the ground, while Sciver-Brunt played an uncharacteristic supporting role before she was excellently caught by a one-handed Harmanpreet at cover to spark a problematic flurry of middle order wickets, which â despite England's eventually match-winning total â is becoming a worrying trend.

Knight was blameless in being run out trying to push things on, undone coming back for a second by Amanjot Kaur's bullet throw from the boundary, before Dunkley was caught at long-off for 15, Capsey was caught reverse-sweeping for two and Lamb continued to look out of place at six as she fell for 11.

From their position, England should have kicked on to 300 and it is likely they will need that should they bat first against Australia â but their winning run goes on, and it is a crucial win against a world-class side that they desperately needed as they approach crunch time.

England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt speaking at the post-match presentation: "I'm so so happy. Everyone showed how calm they were and clear in what they do. We knew in the bowling innings we needed to stick in. 

"It's something we've spoken about before the game [that] we haven't been tested towards the end of our innings with the ball. We wanted to be prepared with our skills and tactics. Everyone had brilliant plans and executed brilliantly."

India captain Harmanpreet Kaur speaking at the post-match presentation: "Smriti Mandhana's wicket was a turning point for us. We had many batters who can bat, I don't know how the game went the other way, but credit to England.

"We are playing good cricket, we are not giving up, that last line we need to cross now, in the last three games we've played good cricket but not crossed that line."

Player of the match Heather Knight: "I'm really pleased, it was nice to get conditions that felt conducive to batting. I got myself in and then put the accelerator down. I felt we needed 300 on that pitch.

"A match-defining innings, which is what I wanted after not contributing the last two games."

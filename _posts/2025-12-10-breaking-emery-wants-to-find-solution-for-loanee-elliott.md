Here’s what you need to know: Aston Villa will have to pay Â£35m for Harvey Elliott if he makes 10 Premier League appearances for them while on loan

Aston Villa manager Unai Emery says he wants to "get a solution" for on-loan Harvey Elliott, who will "not definitely" be joining the club on a permanent basis.

The Liverpool midfielder, 22, has only featured seven times since moving to Villa Park on transfer deadline day.

A Â£35m permanent deal will be triggered if he plays in 10 Premier League games.

Elliott, who starred for England Under-21s as they won the European Championship last summer, is not in the squad for Thursday's Europa League tie at Basel.

His last appearance came as a late substitute against Feyenoord in the Europa League on 2 October.

"We are speaking with him and about his situation. He is not here with us," Emery said when asked about Elliott on Wednesday.

"First, my decision and also the situation. He is on loan playing with us, but he is not definitely adding to us with a permanent contract.

"Hopefully we can get the best for him and the best for us. I respect him as a player and as a person. He is training well, but we have one circumstance with him.

"Hopefully we can get a solution for him to try to play consistently and try to continue in his career with us or not."

Elliott made just two Premier League starts as Liverpool won the title last season.

And a move to another club cannot happen as he has already featured for Villa and his parent club this year - Fifa rules prohibit players from appearing for more than two sides in one season.

Let's dive into the details: Bad Bunny, the shape-shifting Puerto Rican musician, has become the first artist in the 68-year history of the Grammy Awards to win album of the year with a record sung entirely in Spanish.

He was rewarded for his sixth album, Debí Tirar Mas Fotos, a personal and powerful exploration of Latin musical history that beat Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar and Sabrina Carpenter to the ceremony's main prize.

The 31-year-old, who will headline next week's Super Bowl half time show, dedicated his award to immigrants, capping a ceremony where many artists railed against the US administration's current immigration crackdown.

Among them was British star Olivia Dean, who was named best new artist. 

"I'm up here as the grand-daughter of an immigrant," said the singer, whose grandmother Carmen was part of the Windrush generation. 

"I'm a product of bravery and I think those people deserve to be celebrated. We're nothing without each other."

Stars including Kehlani, Gloria Estefan and Billie Eilish also spoke in support of immigrants, while several stars wore badges reading "Ice out" on the red carpet.

Bad Bunny, real name Benito Ocasio, seemed to be stunned when Harry Styles read out his name for the album of the year prize. He took a few moments to collect himself before walking to the stage.

Even so, there were tears in his eyes as he dedicated the award "to all the people that had to leave their home, land, their country, to follow their dreams".

Earlier, winning the prize for best musicá urbana album, he had spoken more directly.

"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out," he said, referring to US immigration officers, after weeks of tension in Minneapolis, including the deaths of two civilians.

"We're not savages, we're not animals, we're not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans."

Billie Eilish, winning song of the year for Wildflower, also addressed the current turmoil gripping America.

"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now," she said. 

"And I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people matter."

Wildflower, a sleeper hit from Eilish's third album Hit Me Hard And Soft, became her third track to win song of the year this decade.

She previously won in 2020 for her breakthrough hit, Bad Guy, and in 2021 for the ballad, Everything I Wanted. 

Earlier in the ceremony, Kendrick Lamar won best rap album for GNX, at which point he overtook Jay-Z as the rapper with the most Grammy Awards - 26 in total.

He later added a 27th trophy to his shelf, winning record of the year for Luther, a soulful duet with the R&B singer, SZA.

The victory came after a confusing couple of minutes onstage at the Crypto.com arena in Los Angeles.

Cher, who had just received a lifetime achievement prize, left the stage without reading out the nominees, then was unsure how to find out who had won.

"They told me it would be on the teleprompter," she said, before opening the envelope and misreading the card. For a moment, it appeared the prize had gone to the late soul singer Luther Vandross, who was sampled on Lamar's track.

Lamar took the fumble in his stride, and paid tribute to Vandross on stage.

"I gotta take my time, because [he's] one of my favourite artists of all time," said the rapper, revealing that he had shed "a tear" when he received permission to sample Vandross's vocals.

"They said 'no cursing, though'," he recalled.  "That was the only thing. We couldn't curse on it."

Joining him onstage, SZA also addressed the current political climate.

"Please don't fall into despair. I know now is a scary time [but] we need to trust each other and trust ourselves. 

"We're not governed by the government, we are governed by god."

Londoner Lola Young won best pop performance for her breakout single Messy; while Lady Gaga's Mayhem was named best pop album.

The star rushed to the stage to breathlessly accept her 16th golden gramophone trophy.

"Every time I'm here, I still feel like I need to pinch myself," she said.

Gaga also used her speech to urge women in music to stand up for their creative vision, noting: "I know sometimes when you're in the studio with a bunch of guys, it can be hard.

"I urge you to... fight for your songs, fight for yourself as a producer [and] make sure that you are heard loudly."

Bad Bunny took home three awards in all - a significant milestone for Latin music which, for many years, was sidelined by the Anglophone music industry.

But the advent of streaming helped to demolish language barriers, with Bad Bunny one of the main beneficiaries. Last year, he was the most-played artist on Spotify, racking up a staggering 19.8 billion streams.

Accepting album of the year, the artist addressed the themes of grief and loss that informed his latest record (whose title translates as "I should have taken more photos".)

"For all the people who have lost someone close to them and had to continue forward with lots of strength, this award is for you," he said in Spanish.

Sunday's ceremony exploded into life with a performance by K-Pop idol Rosé and pop star Bruno Mars.

The duo performed a rock version of their megahit APT, which was nominated for three prizes at the ceremony, including song of the year.

Host Trevor Noah noted that the song was based on a South Korean drinking game, whose rules were more complicated than the US equivalent. "In America, every time you turn on the news, you drink," he joked.

Olivia Dean was one of the first winners, picking up best new artist about an hour into the ceremony.

Carpenter gave the second performance of the night, with an elaborate version of her number one hit Manchild.

She took to the stage dressed as a stewardess, dancing across luggage carousels and navigating male dancers dressed as baggage handlers. She ended the performance with a dove in her hands before taking to the skies.

All eight of the nominees for best new artist then got their chance to shine in an extended segment celebrating "emerging talents who are defining music's zeitgeist".

Among them were Lola Young, playing a solo piano version of her award-winning hit Messy. 

It was the singer's first televised performance since taking an extended break to protect her mental and physical health last year.

Joining her were six-piece girl group Katseye, playing their love-it-or-hate-it viral hit Gnarly; and New York indie artist Sombr, sporting a spangled jumpsuit for his rendition of 12 to 12.

And Dean forecast her Grammy victory with a joyous, full-band performance of Man I Need.

Elsewhere, Justin Bieber gave a stripped down performance of his single Yukon - quite literally, as he performed wearing just boxer shorts and socks, with a guitar slung over his shoulder.

Taking the opposite approach was Bruno Mars, dressed head to toe in a taliored red suit as he sashayed through his latest single, I Just Might. 

And Lady Gaga sported an elaborate bird cage / lampshade headpiece for a grinding electro version of Abracadabra.

Country legend Reba McEntire made her Grammy performance debut, playing  Trailblazer during an In Memoriam section that honoured Jimmy Cliff, Connie Francis, Gwen McRae and Roy Ayers, among others.

Bruce Springsteen recorded a special tribute to Beach Boys star Brian Wilson, while Chaka Khan eulogised funk pioneer Sly Stone.

Metal legend Ozzy Osbourne received a tribute of his own, with an all-star band including Post Malone, Guns N' Roses' Slash and Duff McKagan and The Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith playing the Black Sabbath classic War Pigs.

Watching from the audience were Osbourne's widow Sharon and his children Jack and Kelly.

Finally, Lauryn Hill paid her respects to Angie Stone, Roberta Flack and R&B star D'Angelo. 

"D and I never got to do this on stage together," she said, introducing Nothing Even Matters, a D'Angelo duet from her Grammy-winning album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.

She was then joined by Chaka Khan, Jon Batiste, Wyclef Jean and John Legend for a medley of Flack's hits, closing with a celebratory version of Killing Me Softly, which Hill took to number one with The Fugees in 1996.

In recent years, the main Grammy ceremony has focused more on performances than awards and speeches. This year, only nine prizes were handed out during the three-hour televised event.

The other 86 were distributed in a longer "premiere ceremony" earlier in the day. 

Winners there included British stars Yungblud, FKA Twigs and The Cure.

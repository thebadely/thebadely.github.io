It has been recently reported that New footage shows the man responsible for an attack at a Manchester synagogue, minutes before he drove his car into worshippers on Yom Kippur.

Two people died when Jihad Al-Shamie carried out what Greater Manchester Police (GMP) described as a terror attack in Crumpsall on Thursday.  

Footage of a street nearby marked 09:22 BST, obtained exclusively by the BBC, shows a man matching witness descriptions walking away from the synagogue after a confrontation where he was told to leave.

The doorbell camera then shows a black Kia Picanto, matching the car driven by Al-Shamie, heading back towards the synagogue at 09:26 BST. GMP were called to the scene at 09:31.

The black Kia Picanto also matches the car driven through the gates at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and at worshippers.

As with the car used in the attack, the back right hub cab can be seen missing from the vehicle in the footage.

Two Jewish men Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, died in the attack, the latter believed to have been hit by police gunfire as firearms officers shot Al-Shamie. 

Three people remain in hospital, while police have detained four people on suspicion of terror offences.

In other developments: 

Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson said the force had put "every available resource into making sure that we understand precisely what has happened".

He said "no stone is being left unturned" in the investigation into the attack.

"There is a limit to what I can say at this juncture in terms of the dynamics of that investigation, suffice to say that we know that there are answers that people require, and those answers will be forthcoming as soon as it is appropriate to give them," the police chief said.

Police have been granted more time to hold the four people arrested in custody, while inquiries are under way to establish "the full picture", a spokesman for Counter Terrorism Policing North West said.

Two other people, a man and a woman, were released without charge after they were arrested on the day of the attack.

Al-Shamie, who was born in Syria, was granted British citizenship in 2006. He was on police bail accused of rape when he carried out the car and knife attack.

Police said he had travelled to the synagogue on foot before returning in a car 15 minutes later when the attack began.

He had been seen "acting suspiciously" outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away, according to witnesses. 

Head of Counter Terrorism Policing (CTP) Laurence Taylor said Al-Shamie "did not appear to be known to CTP".

Mr Daulby and Mr Cravitz have been described as heroes for trying to stop the attacker gaining access while worshippers sheltered inside.

Slot on Alexander-Arnold's pending departure from Liverpool

Liverpool manager Arne Slot says he is not going to "tell the fans how they should react" to Trent Alexander-Arnold after the right-back announced he will leave the club this summer.

The 26-year-old said on Monday that he is going to bring his 20-year spell at Anfield to an end by departing on a free transfer when his contract runs out on 30 June 2025.

Since then, Real Madrid â the club he has been heavily linked with during the season - have approached Liverpool about signing Alexander-Arnold before his deal runs out so he can play at the Fifa Club World Cup, which starts on 14 June in the United States.

"That people have an opinion about us, if it is Trent or me or someone else, that is not new for anyone," said Slot on Friday before his side's game against Arsenal on Sunday (16:30 BST).

"Probably, it's a bit more now for him than he is used to and probably a bit more negative than he's used to but I don't follow all of this.

"I am not here to tell the fans how they should react. I will see Trent in a bit - the boys had a few days off as well - so I will wait and see how he feels about him announcing that he is going to leave the club. I did speak to him on WhatsApp.

"Let's wait and see but I'm not here to tell the fans how they should react. We are all disappointed but Trent is the first one also who said that he would prefer us as a team and a club not to be not too much distracted by this announcement.

"I am hoping that all the energy on Sunday goes to the players and less as possible to Trent - unless it is positive then they can do whatever they want."

Slot refused to get drawn into Alexander-Arnold's next club but hinted he knew when asked about Real Madrid trying to sign him for the Club World Cup.

"He hasn't said anything about it himself," added the Dutchman. "For me, it's impossible to comment on where he's going and if that is a club that is going to play in the Club World Cup.

"You see by my smile we both know where he's going to but it hasn't been said yet. That's impossible for me to comment on."

Slot confirmed Northern Ireland international Conor Bradley, 21, will start against Arsenal on Sunday at right-back as he prepares for Alexander-Arnold's exit in a situation he was used to at his previous clubs.

"Like everybody who likes Liverpool and is a fan of Liverpool, we're disappointed for him leaving because not only a good human being is leaving the club but also a very, very good full-back is leaving us as well," said Slot. 

"I also worked at a clubs like AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord where every season a very good player or multiple good players have left the club. I'm a bit more used to players leaving the club.

"The experience I have and this club as well, if a very good player is leaving then the next player will step up and that's probably what's going to happen now as well."

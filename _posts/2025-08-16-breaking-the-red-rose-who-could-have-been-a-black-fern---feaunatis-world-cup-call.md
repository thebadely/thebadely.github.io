My Kiwi accent confuses people - Feaunati

2025 Women's Rugby World Cup

Venue: England Date: 22 August- 27 September 

Coverage: Every match involving England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland live on either BBC One or BBC Two, while every game will be live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app, with coverage on BBC 5 Live, Sport Extra, the BBC Sport website and app

When head coach John Mitchell tapped Maddie Feaunati on the shoulder and told her she had made England's Rugby World Cup squad, it was an ecstatic moment for the 23-year-old.

"I was full of emotions and super speechless," she told BBC Sport. "I didn't really know what to say, I was just very grateful and humbled by it."

After the initial shock had subsided, there was only ever going to be one person the number eight was going to call first - her father, the former Samoa international Isaac Feaunati.

Isaac, who also wore the eight shirt, spent most of his career in England, playing for London Irish, Rotherham, Leeds and Bath, and featured for his country at the 1999 World Cup.

He also found fame in Hollywood after playing New Zealand legend Jonah Lomu in the film Invictus alongside Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.

Feaunati credits her father for her own love of rugby.

"I grew up around it," she said. "It was so normal to me. I guess there was never a point in time where I discovered it, I was literally born into the rugby world.

"I remember just seeing him smash people, run through people, got a bit lipsy sometimes, but I just remember having the best memories.

"It has shaped who I am. I know the game well because I grew up around it. I've still got lots to learn, of course, but I guess it just has given me a different eye for it."

Isaac Feaunati, right, was born in New Zealand, but represented Samoa at international level, qualifying through his parents

Born in Leeds to a Samoan father and a Kiwi mother, Feaunati, who spent time growing up in New Zealand, had the choice of playing for three different international sides.

However, despite embracing all of the blended cultures in her family, she says it was always the Red Roses for her.

"It was no brainer for me," she said.

"England was home to us for so long. Obviously we stayed in New Zealand for a while so both became home but to me England rugby has done so much for me and my family. It was always about the English rugby set-up, the people as well.

"My Kiwi accent confuses people, it's still a part of me. I'm still proud of growing up there and learning their culture, but I'm very proud to be a part of the Red Roses."

Feaunati's World Cup call-up marks a whirlwind two years - she only moved back to England to join Exeter Chiefs in 2023 and made her England debut during the 2024 Six Nations.

After turning down an approach from the Black Ferns before she committed to England, she has since faced New Zealand twice in her career and will come up against Samoa in the World Cup pool stage.

She admits that playing against the countries that mean so much to her family is 'emotional' but that she knew England was the team for her ever since she first wore the white shirt.

"I love this environment; I love being out on the field with these girls, I love training as hard as we do, and I want to be a part of this badly."

Feaunati's England career already includes two Women's Six Nations Grand Slams

With 17 caps under her belt, Feaunati says she is learning every day from the England number eights who have worn the shirt before her. 

Alex Matthews, 32, will be playing in her fourth World Cup, while former England captain Sarah Hunter is now the defence coach for the Red Roses.

"I just chew her [Hunter's] ear off daily, which I'm not sure if she loves, but I just ask her heaps of questions," said Feaunati.

"She's got loads and loads of experience. Alex as well, they're so open to helping me, which I just love, it's really cool."

Unlike Hunter and Matthews, Feaunati has not felt the pain of England's recent record in World Cups. England have lost five of the past six finals, and last tasted success in 2014.

She admits the fact she is about to play in her first World Cup is a 'surreal' moment but one she is taking in her stride.

"It was never 'I'm gonna get there'," she said. 

"It was more just a goal that I just slowly started ticking off. But as soon as Mitch [head coach Mitchell] said those words, I was really like, 'OK, I'm in it now'.

"I just want to keep being the player I am, just keep being fearless is really what I'm going after.

"We talked to the girls that won the 2014 one and they just want us to have that feeling. It would be super cool to do it with this bunch of girls because it's a special group."

As for her parents, who will be flying to England from New Zealand for the World Cup, will there be any split allegiances when it comes to who they will be supporting?

"They're 100% backing the Red Roses," she says laughing. "My whole family is behind us all over the world."

According to new developments, Pontypridd are currently top of the Welsh Premiership on an unbeaten five-game run

Pontypridd are considering a surprise bid for a place in Welsh rugby's second-tier despite initially rejecting the chance to join Super Rygbi Cymru (SRC).

The Sardis Road side play in the third-tier Welsh Premiership having refused to apply for one of 10 places in SRC when launched in 2024.

At the time, Pontypridd said the competition would "jeopardise its solvency as a commercial entity" due to a reduced number of fixtures.

But with regional rugby also facing potential major change, Pontypridd, once one of the nation's leading teams in Wales, are eyeing a possible bid.

In a statement, external released following a  members meeting, executive director Phil Miles wrote: "It is still unclear what the outcome of the WRU consultation project will be, in terms of the number and branding of the regions, and the structure of the semi-pro and community game below that. 

"Ideally our ambition would be to make a successful application to join Super Rygbi Cymru but that would of course need to be reviewed in terms of the playing, coaching and financial implications, when the time comes to do so."

Who will decide the fate of Welsh rugby?

Cardiff RFC also initially took a stance against joining the SRC before the then new owners Helford Capital Limited led a successful application to be included.

Since then, Cardiff RFC's senior organisation Cardiff Rugby, who play in the United Rugby Championship, were rescued from oblivion by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in April 2025.

However, Cardiff remain the only team from the region to be in SRC after Merthyr also declined to be involved.

The WRU is now formulating proposals that will revamp its professional tier with a reduction from four to two or three teams touted.

Miles also wrote that in recent years, the south Wales valleys club, five-time Welsh club champions, has spent recent years "firefighting and resolving" financial issues.

He added: "I feel we are now turning the corner, putting our house in order, helped by the expiry of some long-standing loans and the support of our sponsors and shareholders."

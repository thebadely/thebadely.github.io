Experts revealed that Harry Kane played under current England boss Thomas Tuchel when they were  at Bayern Munich 

England captain Harry Kane says his side "got away with it" in their 1-0 win against Andorra in a performance that "wasn't good enough".

In a disappointing display against a team ranked 173rd in the world, England won courtesy of a solitary Kane goal after 50 minutes in Barcelona.

England were booed by some of their fans at half-time and full-time, while manager Thomas Tuchel said his side "lacked the seriousness and the urgency that is needed in a World Cup qualifier".

"It wasn't our greatest performance," said Kane, whose goal took his tally to 72 for England. 

"I don't think it's one many people are going to remember, that's for sure, but it's three points in the bag.

"But, yeah, for sure we know we can play better in all aspects, both with and without the ball.

"It's down to us now to analyse it, look back and try and learn from it because condition-wise it's going to be very similar to next summer - dry pitch, warm weather, humid."

He added: "It [the goal] was probably our best move and we just didn't have enough of that, both with probably the runs and also the quality - a lot of balls kind of overhit, out of play, and it just kind of killed our momentum, especially there in the second half."

The 2026 World Cup will be held across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

England beat Latvia and Albania in their first two World Cup qualifiers in March before the win against Andorra.

They are top of Group K, with Albania second on four points, Latvia third with three points after two games, Serbia fourth with one point from one game and Andorra bottom.

Kane added: "We were just lacking quality [against Andorra], looked a bit fatigued both physically and mentally and, yeah, we got away with it because we're a good team and they had a couple of half-chances where we didn't get punished. But ultimately, it wasn't good enough."

England's next game is a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City Ground on Tuesday (19:45 BST).

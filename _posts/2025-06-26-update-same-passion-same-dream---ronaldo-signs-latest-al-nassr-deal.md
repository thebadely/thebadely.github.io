Here’s what you need to know: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 938 goals for club and country

Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a new two-year contract with Al-Nassr that means he will stay with the Saudi Pro League club until beyond his 42nd birthday.

The Portugal captain, 40, joined the Riyadh-based team in December 2022 after leaving Manchester United in acrimonious circumstances, having criticised the club and said he had "no respect" for manager Erik ten Hag.

Ronaldo's Al-Nassr deal had been due to expire at the end of June and there was speculation he could leave, but that has now been quashed.

In a post on X, Ronaldo wrote: "A new chapter begins. Same passion, same dream. Let's make history together."

Although Al-Nassr have not added to their nine domestic titles during Ronaldo's time at the club, they have benefited from a flood of goals from the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.

Ronaldo scored 35 times in 41 matches across all competitions last term and was the league's top scorer for a second consecutive season.

He has managed 99 goals in 111 appearances overall for Al-Nassr and is well on his way to reaching 1,000 senior goals in his career, with a current tally of 938 for club and country.

Having helped Portugal win the Uefa Nations League a little over two weeks ago, the former Manchester United, Real Madrid, Sporting and Juventus forward will almost certainly now be targeting a sixth World Cup appearance next summer.

Only a month ago, Ronaldo posted on social media to say "the chapter is over".

That came after the Saudi Pro League wrapped up with Al-Nassr finishing third and trophyless once again.

The comment fuelled rumours that Ronaldo was ready to leave the league where he reportedly became the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of Â£177m when he joined.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino raised the prospect of Ronaldo joining a team involved in the Club World Cup after Al-Nassr failed to qualify for the extended tournament which is being held in the United States.

Ronaldo said he had received offers from participating teams but had turned them down.

The decision to stay until at least 2027, which is certain to be highly lucrative, appears to rule out any future prospect of Ronaldo returning to play at the highest level in Europe.

It remains to be seen who will be leading the first team at Al-Nassr going forward, after former AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli left the club this week.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jack Ashworth has appeared in 24 of Hull FC's 25 Super League games this season

Hull FC forward Jack Ashworth could face a ban of six matches or more after being charged with striking in their derby defeat by Hull KR.

The 29-year-old appeared to hit Robins' playmaker Mikey Lewis in the head with his forearm in the closing minutes.

Catalans Dragons' Franck Maria has also been charged with a Grade E offence of head contact in their win over Salford and, like Ashworth, will face a tribunal later this week.

Salford's Loghan Lewis and Warrington's Luke Yates will both miss the remainder of the season after being given three and two-match bans respectively.

Three other Hull FC players have been handed suspensions after Sunday's fractious derby clash.

Jordan Rapana has been given a two-game ban for two separate incidents, while Amir Bourough and Yusuf Aydin have both been given one-match suspensions.

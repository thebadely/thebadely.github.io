Let's dive into the details: Donald Trump is greeted by American six-time major champion John McEnroe at the 2015 US Open

President Donald Trump will attend the US Open men's singles final on Sunday in what will be his first visit to the Grand Slam tennis event since 2015.

Trump, who was re-elected in 2024 for a second term in office, has not been to the New York City tournament since he first came to power in 2016.

He had previously visited Flushing Meadows on several occasions before being joined by wife Melania on his last visit a decade ago.

A White House official confirmed to the BBC that the president was expected to attend.

In 2015, Trump was greeted by American six-time major champion John McEnroe as he watched from a hospitality area.

Trump, 79, was born in the Queens borough of New York City where the Grand Slam tournament is held.

No American players will compete in the men's final, which starts at 14:00 (19:00 BST) on Sunday.

The finalists will be decided by Friday's last-four matches, when Serbia's Novak Djokovic plays Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, followed by Italy's Jannik Sinner against Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime.

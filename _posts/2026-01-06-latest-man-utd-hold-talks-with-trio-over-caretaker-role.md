Experts revealed that Michael Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Darren Fletcher all won multiple Premier League titles with Manchester United

Manchester United have held preliminary talks with former players Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer about becoming the club's caretaker manager until the end of the season.

Talks are at a very early, sounding out stage and while it is not yet known who the leading contender is to temporarily replace Ruben Amorim for the rest of the campaign, BBC Sport has been told Carrick is a serious candidate.

Amorim was sacked on Monday after a turbulent 14 months in charge, with former United midfielder Fletcher appointed interim manager.

The Scot will remain in place until a caretaker is appointed, with the club planning to name a permanent successor for Amorim in the summer.

Director of football Jason Wilcox has spoken to Fletcher and his former United team-mates Solskjaer and Carrick about taking the role, while another former United player Ruud van Nistelrooy is also believed to be a contender.

Van Nistelrooy managed three victories and a draw in his four games as caretaker boss in 2024. 

Solskjaer initially took charge in a similar fashion when United sacked Jose Mourinho in 2018, and he subsequently became the full-time manager for three years before leaving in 2021.

Carrick has been out of work since departing Middlesbrough last June.

Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and former Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi - now at Marseille - are understood to be early contenders for the full-time job.

Glasner, who won the FA Cup with the Eagles last season, was asked about the link during his news conference on Tuesday.

He said: "I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask me any more questions about it."

Fletcher spoke to the media on Tuesday before Wednesday night's game at Burnley and said he is concentrating purely on that match for now.

"It's surreal, it's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team," he said.

"I didn't think in my wildest dreams that was something that could happen. It's all happened so quickly, all my concentration and efforts are going on Burnley.

"Everyone expects Manchester United to be on top and winning - that's what we have to achieve and I will do my best in whatever role to make that happen."

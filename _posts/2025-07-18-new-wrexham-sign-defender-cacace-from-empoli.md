According to new developments, Liberato Cacace started his career with New Zealand club Wellington Phoenix

Wrexham have signed Empoli defender Liberato Cacace in what could be their most expensive signing since the 2021 takeover of the club by co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.

The 24-year-old had a year left on his contract at Empoli, who were relegated from Serie A last season, and he has signed a three-year deal at Wrexham.

Wrexham broke the Â£1m barrier for the first time last season when they landed Reading striker Sam Smith in January.

The fee for Cacace has not been disclosed, but Wrexham were understood to be prepared to push beyond the Smith fee to land the defender, who has 33 caps for New Zealand, as they prepare for their a campaign in the Championship.

Cacace said he was "absolutely delighted" commit to Wrexham.

He added: "Looking from the outside, what they are creating here is something I want to be part of. The family they have here â it's a tight-knit club and that enticed me.

"I had a great phone call with the manager, and after that I really wanted to sign."

Boss Phil Parkinson said: "We are delighted to welcome Libby to Wrexham and look forward to integrating him with the squad on our return home."

Cacace is Wrexham's third signing of this summer following three successive promotions.

Parkinson's side have also added Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward and former Plymouth Argyle forward Ryan Hardie as they embark on a first season in England's second tier for 43 years. 

Wrexham are in New Zealand to play Wellington Phoenix, Cacace's first club, in a pre-season friendly on Saturday (06:00 BST).

Cacace, who was born in Wellington to an Italian father and a New Zealand mother of Italian descent, is primarily a left-back but can also operate further forward.

He played 93 games for Empoli since heading to Italian football in 2022, but had been linked with a move away following the club's relegation from Serie A.

Ollie Rathbone scored a career-best eight goals last season as he helped Wrexham win promotion from League One.

Before facing Wellington, then returning to north Wales to continue pre-season,  Parkinson faces a further wait over the fitness of midfielder Ollie Rathbone who suffered an ankle injury in the defeat by Sydney FC.

An X-ray has shown no break, but Wrexham are now waiting for results of scans, with the player set to remain in a protective boot for the next two weeks before further assessment.

Meanwhile, striker Jack Marriott will have his return to the UK delayed after he fell ill and required surgery to remove his appendix.

Fellow striker Smith has not featured so far on the tour as he recovers from an unspecified issue, although Andy Cannon (ACL) and Mo Faal (thigh) have both resumed training after long-term injuries during the tour that also saw Wrexham beat Melbourne Victory.

Crowds of around 40,000 watched Wrexham in their first two fixtures, with local estimations of 25,000 expected to be in attendance for Saturday's game at the Sky Stadium.

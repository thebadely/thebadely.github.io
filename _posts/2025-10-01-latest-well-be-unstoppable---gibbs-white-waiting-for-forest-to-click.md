Let's dive into the details: Nottingham Forest are 17th in the table, one point above the relegation zone

"This is what comes with trying to get to the top. You're always going to have blips, but when we get that first win we'll be unstoppable."

The confidence oozing from Morgan Gibbs-White suggests there is no lack of belief at Nottingham Forest.

They are still waiting for their first win under Ange Postecoglou after his opening five games and face FC Midtjylland in the Europa League on Thursday.

Postecoglou replaced Nuno Espirito Santo last month, Nuno having taken Forest back to Europe for the first time in 30 years, with a stated aim to win trophies.

Having won the Europa League with Tottenham last season - before being sacked 16 days later - 60-year-old Postecoglou knows progress in football is not always linear, a sentiment shared by Gibbs-White.

"The way to the top isn't always beautiful and it's not always glory. You've seen in the past month and a half here, we've had a change of manager," says the England international.

"There's been a lot that's happened within the club. We haven't got a win yet, so it's not all rise and glory. We've been through the relegation times and we had a great season last season and we're in Europe now.

"The manager has taken well to the group we've taken well to him. We believe in him and his ideas. He's well respected within the group and I think you can see how we're playing out there.

"It's obviously been a difficult moment, a difficult time. But when we get that first win we'll be fine."

It is the first European match at the City Ground since a Bayern Munich team including Jurgen Klinsmann, Oliver Kahn and Lothar Matthaus thrashed them 5-1 in March 1996.

Forest have not returned since that quarter-final, which Bayern won 7-2 on aggregate before going on to win the competition.

Midtjylland arrive following Forest's opening 2-2 draw at Real Betis last week.

That a point in their opening European game could be seen as a disappointment - Anthony levelled for the hosts with five minutes left - shows how far Forest have come in the 15 months since beating relegation on the final day in 2023-24.

And after a generation away, European football is what will be demanded at Forest going forward, something not lost on Postecoglou.

"I'm really privileged. That's on the back of the work of guys like Coops (Steve Cooper) and Nuno that have got us to this point. I'm the beneficiary of that, and I don't take that lightly," he said.

"It is a privilege, but it's one I'm looking forward to - the responsibility of leading the club back in Europe for the first time in 30 years and hopefully making it a campaign to remember. More importantly, it's something this football club wants to do on a regular basis, every season.

"The European nights are always special. On the back of a 30-year absence, I've got a feeling it is going to be one of those nights."

Context is crucial in looking at the slow start.

Postecoglou's opening 3-0 defeat by Arsenal last month came after one full training session with the whole squad following the international break.

There have been glimpses of the free-flowing, high-tempo way he wants to play, but it has so far been unable to get results, a 1-1 Premier League draw at Burnley coming after a late collapse in the Carabao Cup at Swansea.

Regardless of the five games, Postecoglou has been in charge only 22 days with limited time on the training pitch, meaning there are no internal concerns over the winless run, with belief they just need time.

"A key thing the manager said is, once everyone is on board with the style of play and the tactics, the quicker the results will come," full-back Neco Williams told Sky Sports last week.

"That is just on us now to get used to his tactics and the new style of play, which is obviously different from our previous manager. The quicker that comes together, the quicker we will get results."

Postecoglou himself remains certain of those results once the squad get used to his style following almost two years under Nuno.

There is, so far, little difference when looking at the statistics - even if the expansiveness of the team is evident.

Under Nuno, who also managed three league games this season, Forest had 57% possession compared to 58% under Postecoglou.

Forest have made 146 more passes over the three league matches with the new manager and have had 44 shots - compared to 31 under Nuno - although they have scored only once.

They have faced more shots (39) in Postecoglou's games than under Nuno (30) but the expected goals (xG) against has decreased from 5.0 to 3.9.

When looking at Postecoglou's Tottenham v Nuno's Forest last season, there is a clear difference in some key metrics.

Spurs made 11 errors leading to goals, compared to Forest's four, while their xG against of 64.3 was the fourth highest in the league, with Forest 12th on 49.6.

Forest made 12,956 passes in 2024-25, a league low, while Spurs were sixth with 18,248.

Spurs also had more possession, more expected goals and more crosses - showing the attacking nature of Postecoglou's style - but Forest finished seventh, 27 points ahead of 17th-placed Tottenham.

"We need to keep developing our football," said Postecoglou. "It's not because it eases some kind of pressure, but I really believe when everything clicks and we're up and running we're going to be a top team and the results will flow.

"I would hate we get to the business end of the year and we look at this stage and wish if we'd had a couple more wins we'd be in a great position. I don't want to be chasing ourselves.

"I have no doubt the results will come and we will be a compelling team to watch and in the way we play our football, and results will follow that.

"It's important in this early stage you do win games, so when it does all click you are in a position to have success."

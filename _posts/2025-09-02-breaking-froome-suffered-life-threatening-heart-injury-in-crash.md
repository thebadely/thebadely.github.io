According to new developments, Chris Froome won the Tour de France in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017

Chris Froome's wife says the four-time Tour de France winner suffered a life-threatening injury to his heart in last week's bike crash in southern France.

The 40-year-old Briton was airlifted to hospital after sustaining five broken ribs, a collapsed lung and a lumbar vertebrae fracture in the training crash.

Froome's wife Michelle has since told The Times, external that doctors discovered a pericardial rupture - an injury where the sac that surrounds the heart is torn - during surgery which they were able to repair.

Michelle Froome said her husband's injuries - sustained after he collided head-on with a road sign at more than 30mph - were "obviously a lot more serious than some broken bones".

"He's fine but it's going to be a long recovery process," she said. 

"He won't be riding a bike for a while. Chris is happy for you to share this because people need to understand what is going on."

The operation to repair Froome's heart took place at the Sainte-Anne Toulon military hospital, which is the highest-level trauma centre in that part of France and specialises in thoracic surgery.

Froome is one of the most decorated cyclists in history.

He has won seven Grand Tours, including one Giro d'Italia and two Vuelta a Espana titles alongside his Tour de France triumphs.

He earned the first of his four Tour victories in 2013, before winning three successive titles between 2015 and 2017.

Only four men - Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain - have won more Tour de France titles.

Froome won two Olympic bronze medals in the individual time trial in 2012 and 2016, and was made an OBE for his services to cycling in 2015.

The IsraelâPremier Tech rider, who is out of contract at the end of the year, is expected to miss the remainder of the season with his injuries.

In 2019, Froome was ruled out of the Tour de France, having been placed in intensive care after sustaining multiple injuries when he crashed into a wall in training.

Froome has previously suggested that 2025 could be his final year of competitive racing.

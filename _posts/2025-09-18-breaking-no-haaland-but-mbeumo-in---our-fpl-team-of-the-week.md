Let's dive into the details: Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals - in the FPL team of the week.

Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland and Mohamed Salah.

While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.

What you do long term with those two assets is a different question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Don't miss our FPL special week three Q&A with expert Gianni Buttice live on the BBC Sport website at 15:30 BST on Friday, 19 September.

Wildcard Chris and Dull Dave

Losing Yoane Wissa to injury was a blow but captain Salah (18 points) and a clean-sheet clean sweep helped the side stutter to a respectable 57 points.

Sam Johnstone, Wolves, keeper, Â£4.5m - Leeds (h)

Wolves v Leeds feels like the most likely 0-0 draw this week. The home side have only scored in one Premier League match so far this season, while the visitors have netted just once in the top flight - and that was a penalty.

Picking Fulham's Bernd Leno against Leeds last week paid off, so we go again.

Joe Rodon, Leeds United, Â£4m - Wolves (a)

Leeds have struggled up front but defensively they've been solid and Rodon has emerged as a fine budget choice.

He has 38 defensive contribution (defcon) points so far - earning the two-point bonus twice - and takes on a Wolves side with just two goals so far.

Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool, Â£6.1m - Everton (h)

Van Dijk is another defcon accumulator with 50 this season (21 alone in the Bournemouth game) and has clean sheets in his past two games.

Given this version of Everton is expected to be more attacking, there's a decent chance the Dutchman will be involved enough defensively to come close to the 10 defcon points needed to earn bonus points.

Joachim Andersen, Fulham, Â£4.5m - Brentford (h)

Notice a trend here? Andersen completes this high-chance-of-defcon trio. He has earned the bonus in his past three games and you'd hope for another low-scoring match here against Brentford to give him a good chance of a clean sheet too.

Antoine Semenyo has had a whopping six big chances this season

Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, Â£7.5m - Newcastle (h)

Semenyo has made himself almost essential with his early season form, and his statistics are off the charts.

Of all players, only Haaland has had more shots, shots in the box, expected goals (xG), goals and big chances. That's quite a list.

Among midfielders, the Ghanaian is far and away the best pick at the moment.

Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United, Â£8.1m - Chelsea (h)

It might surprise you, but Manchester United have had more shots than any other team - 10 more than Chelsea and Liverpool, who are next in the list.

Only Manchester City (8.41) have a higher xG than United's 8.24. Yet City have scored eight goals, Chelsea (8.17) have nine and United just four.

What does this mean? Over time, teams normally perform closer to their xG so United have been unlucky in attack.

And so far Mbeumo (xG 1.17 and one goal) has been the shining light for United. His numbers are almost as good as Semenyo (both have 12 shots, five on target) without the returns.

Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, Â£14.5m - Everton (h)

You need at least one of Salah and Haaland this season and I'm backing the former's track record in the Merseyside derby. 

Yes, this game has been tight in the past but Salah has many paths to return despite his mediocre open-play form. Back him for one more week.

Xavi Simons, Spurs, Â£7m - Brighton (a)

Simons is an exciting addition to this Spurs side. 

There's not enough data to make this a considered choice, but the Dutchman is filling the Son Heung-min role in a 4-3-3 for an attacking Spurs side in a game that feels like it will be high-scoring.

Worth the risk.

Lucas Paqueta, West Ham, Â£5.9m - Crystal Palace (h)

The last time West Ham were asked to bounce back from a humiliating defeat, they did so with a 3-0 victory.

This is a huge game for the Hammers and boss Graham Potter and they will look to talismen Jarrod Bowen and Paqueta to perform.

The Brazilian is on penalties and a great budget choice in general.

Joao Pedro leads all forwards with 33 FPL points

Joao Pedro, Chelsea, Â£7.8m - Manchester United (a)

If Semenyo is the must-pick midfielder, then Joao Pedro fills that role up front.

He has returned in three of four games and United's defence is nothing to be scared of.

Chris Wood, Nottingham Forest, Â£7.6m - Burnley (a)

Burnley have the worst expected goals conceded (xGC) in the league at 9.1 - a goal and a half worse than the nearest team.

They've done well to concede just seven goals but last week against Liverpool, for example, they allowed a whopping 27 shots.

Ange Postecoglou has had more time with this Forest team to stamp his mark. We expect them to be more attacking, and Wood is a man who doesn't need too many chances.

Jose Sa, Wolves, Â£4.5m, keeper - Leeds (h)

Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, Â£5.5m, defender - Everton (h)

Lyle Foster, Burnley, Â£5.0m, striker - Nottingham Forest (h)

Ezri Konsa, Aston Villa, Â£4.5m, defender - Sunderland (a)

Team total cost: Â£97m

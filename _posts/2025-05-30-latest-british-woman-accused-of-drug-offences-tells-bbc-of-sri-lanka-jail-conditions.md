It has been recently reported that A British woman accused of attempting to smuggle drugs into Sri Lanka has told the BBC about the conditions in the jail where she is being held.

Charlotte May Lee, 21, from south London, was arrested earlier this month after authorities allegedly found 46kg of cannabis in her suitcases when she arrived on a flight from Thailand. 

"I can't compare it to anything," she said, adding she shares a cell with five other women and sleeps on a thin mattress on the concrete floor, using her clothes as a pillow.

Ms Lee has not yet been charged, but has previously denied knowing the alleged drugs were in her luggage. If found guilty, she could face up to 25 years behind bars.

The former flight attendant told the BBC she had travelled from Bangkok to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo to renew her Thai visa.

She made a procedural court appearance on Friday while the investigation into her alleged offences continues. 

Speaking to the BBC before appearing in court, Ms Lee appeared to be in good spirits. 

She described her living conditions at a prison in Negombo, a city just north of the capital, saying she spends most of her day inside, although she does get to go outside for fresh air.

"I have never been to prison and I've never been to Sri Lanka," she said. "This heat and just sitting on a concrete floor all of the time."

Ms Lee said she tries not to dwell too much on her current predicament.

"I am not trying to think about it. If I think, then I feel bad. I'll still rather not process it."

She said she is concerned for the other women who are also in prison.

"There are people from so many different countries who have been here for two years, two-and-a-half years. And it's still just waiting and no-one actually knows anything."

She has managed to find other English-speaking women with whom she has developed a kinship. But she has not been able to speak with her family since her arrest.

Ms Lee arrived at Negombo Magistrate's Court on Friday wearing a white knee-length dress, her long hair parted to the side. 

She was held in a cell at the back of the courtroom before being brought to the witness box. She was visibly upset as she stood with her hands crossed behind her back, facing the magistrate.

Authorities wheeled in a large brown box containing the alleged 46kg of cannabis found in Ms Lee's luggage. 

The narcotics division of the Sri Lanka police told the court they intend to file an update on the investigation. 

Ms Lee's lawyer, Sampath Perera, asked if the alleged drugs had been examined by the relevant government authorities to ascertain if the materials were in fact an illegal substance. 

The magistrate ordered it to be tested and for a report to be submitted to the court as soon as possible.

Speaking to the BBC from outside the courthouse after the hearing, Mr Perera said the next step is to make a bail application for Ms Lee, which could take three months.

Under Sri Lankan law, people being held on remand must appear before a judge every 14 days. 

Ms Lee is being held on suspicion of keeping illegal drugs in her possession and drug smuggling. Her next court appearance will be on 13 July.

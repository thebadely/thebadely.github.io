It has been recently reported that Josh Kerr had time to wave to the crowd on his final lap in Birmingham

Josh Kerr says it "shows I'm strong enough" to defend his 1500m title at September's World Championship in Tokyo after coasting to victory in the 5,000m at the UK Athletics Championships. 

With Kerr already assured of GB selection and not running his preferred distance, compatriot Neil Gourlay was crowned 1500m champion for a third year running on a day when Laura Muir suffered a shock defeat by Livingston's Sarah Calvert in the women's event.

Kerr broke clear of Rory Leonard with two laps remaining to come in nine seconds clear of another Englishman, Jack Kavanagh.

Asked what it meant for his world title defence at the shorter distance, Kerr told BBC Sport: "It's definitely on the cards.

"It was a hard effort and spending 12 and a half laps out there is a bit different and a bit more than I'm expecting, but that mile push hopefully shows I'm strong enough for five weeks time."

Kerr pointed out the strength of British middle distance running.

"This title's been British for about three or four years and it's hopefully going to stay British for the next couple of years and it's my job to do that," he said after his win at the event in Birmingham that doubled as the British trials.

"We have a fantastic set of 1500m guys going after it as well, so we are in a great spot in the UK."

Gourlay proved himself best of the rest and said "it feels great" after beating Englishman Elliot Giles in a sprint finish to secure the British title for the fourth time in six years.

"It's a bit surreal having that longevity with all the people that have been coming and going through this event," he told Scottish Athletics.

"It's always the challenge to come and take care of business here in terms of qualification for the world championships, but the goal was certainly to win and it feels satisfying to do that today.

"To win the last three is quite something given the people I've ended up being up against over these years."

Jemma Reekie booked her 800m place in the team for Tokyo, but the Scot had to be content with second spot behind in-form Englishwoman Georgia Hunter Bell.

Meanwhile, Alessandro Schenini took gold in the long jump, Kirsty Law won silver in the discus and Bera Ajala was third in the men's triple jump.

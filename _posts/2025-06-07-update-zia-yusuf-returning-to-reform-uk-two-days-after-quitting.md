According to new developments, Zia Yusuf, who resigned as Reform UK chairman on Thursday, is to return to work for the party in a new role.

Yusuf will lead what the party calls its "Doge team" – which is modelled on the Department of Government Efficiency set up by US President Donald Trump.

Earlier this week, Yusuf quit the party, saying working to get it elected was no longer "a good use of my time", without expanding further.

On Saturday, Reform leader Nigel Farage told the BBC he was "delighted" Yusuf was had returned to the party and that he will now take on a more public role for the party in a new role, appearing more frequently in the media.

He said: "Zia regrets what he said and did the other day. It was a combination of 11 months hard work and exhaustion."

In a post on X, Yusuf said he had received a large number of messages urging him to reconsider leaving the party and explained why he quit two days ago.

"After 11 months of working as a volunteer to build a political party from scratch, with barely a single day off, my tweet was a decision born of exhaustion," he wrote. 

Yusuf said he came into politics "out of belief that Nigel Farage was the man" to lead the country, adding "I believe in these things more than ever".

Before his resignation, Yusuf had criticised Sarah Pochin, who won last month's Runcorn and Helsby by-election for the party.

She urged Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka "in the interests of public safety" during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

Yusuf said it was "dumb for a party to ask the PM if they would do something the party itself wouldn't do". A burka ban is not Reform party policy. 

Farage told the BBC that Yusuf, who is a Muslim, "gets even more racial abuse on X than ever" when Islam is discussed. 

"In retrospect, he knows a lot of it is bots trying to damage Reform. It is not Reform members," he added. 

"Yes, some of it is the alt-right, but there's a lot of bots. He regrets it and wants to continue working for us."

Speaking to BBC News on Saturday evening, Farage said Yusuf would have a "very clearly defined role", and that his previous workload was "way too much for anybody".

Asked whether Yusuf was burnt out, the Reform UK leader said that description would be accurate, adding:  "I would credit much of the success we enjoyed on 1 May and since to his considerable efforts.

"Any discussion around Islam, terrorism, in this case the burka and he can't win.

"He is subjected to pretty vile abuse and... we're all human. He overreacted to it and he admits himself it was a mistake."

Other parties have criticised Reform over Yusuf's reappointment. Labour described it as "humiliating hokey-cokey" and the Liberal Democrats called it a game of "musical chairman".

But Farage rejected suggestions the episode showed the party was in disarray, saying "we will emerge from this much stronger". 

Yusuf - a former banker who sold his tech company for more than £200m, and was previously a member of the Conservative Party - became Reform's chairman shortly after last year's general election and was seen as central to the party's operation.

The party's so-called Doge UK team, which was set up to identify spending cuts in councils the party now controls, was formally launched this week.

Further appointments by the party are also expected soon in what it described as an "expanded management structure".

A new party chairman is expected to be appointed next week and a deputy chairman will be hired too.

According to new developments, Alfie Hewett (left) and Gordon Reid have won 23 Grand Slam doubles titles together

Great Britain's Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid both recorded victories to set up a quarter-final meeting in the Australian Open men's wheelchair singles, before joining forces to reach the semi-finals of the doubles competition.

Defending champion Hewett took just 55 minutes to complete a 6-2 6-1 win over Japan's Takuya Miki, while Reid beat Australian wildcard Anderson Parker 6-3 6-2.

Hewett and Reid then began their pursuit of a seventh successive wheelchair doubles title in Melbourne by defeating Miki and Dutchman Tom Egberink 6-0 6-4.

The pair have won 18 of the past 23 Grand Slam titles in the doubles format.

They will face either second seeds Martin de la Puente and Stephane Houdet or Tokito Oda and Gustavo Fernandez for a place in the final.

Hewett won his second Australian Open singles title last year - his 10th Grand Slam singles title overall.

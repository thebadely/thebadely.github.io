It has been recently reported that Health experts in Guernsey have reminded islanders to look after their wellbeing as the festive season can bring pressure, tiredness and moments of loneliness alongside the lights, laughs and togetherness.

Director of Public Health Services Nicola Brink said it was important to  remember personal wellbeing matters and not get overwhelmed by the festive celebrations.

"We must not forget to be kind to ourselves and take opportunities to relax too," she said.

Her suggestions include eating well, taking time to slow down - even on the busiest days - and asking for support if needed.

She advised people to "pause and breathe" and take a few minutes to slow down.

"It also helps to stay connected with others, whether at a community event or catching up with a friend on the phone, which can just lift your mood and remind you that you're not alone," she said.

Ms Brink also suggested that islanders try to find joy in the "small things" such as the lights in Guernsey as well as making sure to set boundaries.

 "It's okay to say no to gatherings, traditions or commitments that leave you feeling drained," she said.

"Simply say 'no, it's not for me'."

Dr Beverley Tachon, who is the  psychologist and service manager for Healthy Minds, said: "Christmas can be hard for many people and for lots of different reasons. 

"If you can, talk to a trusted friend or family member."

She said talking to someone can make people "feel more supported and less alone".

Jo Cottell, Guernsey Mind chief executive, said people have control over how they spend the holidays and it was important to prioritise wellbeing.

She said the season can bring challenges including money worries, family conflict, unrealistic expectations and feelings of isolation.

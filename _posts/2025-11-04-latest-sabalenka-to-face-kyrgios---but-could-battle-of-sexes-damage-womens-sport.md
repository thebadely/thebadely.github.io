Here’s what you need to know: Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios will meet at the 17,000-capacity Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai

World number one Aryna Sabalenka will face Nick Kyrgios in a 'Battle of the Sexes' exhibition match in the United Arab Emirates later this year.

Belarus' Sabalenka, 27, and 30-year-old Australian Kyrgios - ranked 652nd in the world - are set to play each other at the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai on 28 December.

Four-time Grand Slam winner Sabalenka is the reigning US Open champion.

Kyrgios, who reached a career-high 13th in 2016, has only played five matches this year since returning from a serious wrist injury that kept him out for 18 months.

He has not played on the ATP Tour since losing in the Miami Open second round in March.

"I have a lot of respect for Nick and his talent, but make no mistake, I'm ready to bring my A-game," Sabalenka said.

Three official matches labelled as the 'Battle of the Sexes' have taken place - most famously between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973.

American veteran Riggs had beaten Australia's Margaret Court before King exacted revenge four months later.

In 1992, a 40-year-old Jimmy Connors beat fellow multiple Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, then 35, under hybrid rules.

"I have so much respect for Billie Jean King and what she has done for the women's game," Sabalenka added.

"I'm proud to represent women's tennis and to be part of this modern take of the iconic 'Battle of the Sexes' match." 

Kyrgios, who reached the 2022 Wimbledon final, said he will relish the chance to play against Sabalenka, with whom he shares the same agent.

"When the world number one challenges you, you answer the call. I've got massive respect for Aryna; she's a powerhouse and a true champion," he said.

"But I've never backed down from a challenge, and I'm not just here to play, I'm here to entertain. This is what I live for."

Tennis fans have been divided into two camps since rumblings of this exhibition began at the US Open in September.

Some think it is a bit of harmless entertainment which will successfully attract the eyeballs of a newer, younger audience in the age of social-media content.

Others believe it is a misguided venture - organised by the Evolve agency which the players both share - and sets up an opportunity for women's sport to be belittled if Sabalenka is beaten by Kyrgios.

The fact that Kyrgios pleaded guilty to assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2023, then later had to distance himself from controversial influencer Andrew Tate in 2024, is a big reason why that camp of people believe this exhibition could unnecessarily fuel sexism and misogyny.

Sabalenka does not seem to be too worried the event will have a negative impact on women's sports. Speaking about the possibility at the US Open, she said it was a "cool idea" and laughed as she pledged to "kick Nick's ass".

While the financial reward and boost to her profile is likely to be significant, many wonder what Sabalenka stands to gain from an on-court perspective - especially if she loses to a man who has not been fit for a long time.

For Kyrgios, he manages to stay relevant despite his continued absence from the tour and firmly in the spotlight which he has consistently shown he loves to be in.

At this stage, details about the format of the match are still scarce - although serving restrictions and potential court modifications are believed to have been discussed.

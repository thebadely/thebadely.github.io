According to new developments, Northern Ireland were beaten by Denmark despite taking an early lead

Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill wants to see his side enjoy more of the ball in Tuesday night's friendly against Iceland in Belfast.

They defended resolutely for long periods of Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Denmark in Copenhagen but ultimately were undone by Christian Eriksen's 67th-minute winner.

An own goal from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg had given the visitors the lead after only five minutes, but Denmark equalised through their first shot on target when Gustav Isaksen curled in a fine effort in first-half stoppage time.

While Northern Ireland have had some strong results without the majority of the ball during O'Neill's second spell in charge, the former Stoke manager believes doing more in possession will be the next step for his side.

"We were never going to be a dominant possession-based team against any of these teams," said O'Neill after Denmark had more than 70% possession on Saturday.

"We're asking players who play their football at a League One or Championship level to go out against players who play their football in the top five leagues in Europe. There is a difference in terms of the level that the players play their football.

"I thought the way we have to try and close that gap is to be what we are, a team that's well organised, well structured, difficult to beat, can frustrate the opposition, but obviously carry a threat as well."

Despite taking an early lead, Northern Ireland failed to register a shot on target throughout the game.

O'Neill added: "In terms of where we need to get to as a team, we need to be able to retain the ball a little bit better when we win it back, maybe find a little bit more in terms of our level of possession as well and that will help us carry a bigger threat."

Knowing they will face Germany in World Cup qualifying in September, O'Neill has consciously taken friendlies against a higher level of opposition than his side faced when earning promotion from the third tier of the Nations League.

Saturday's reverse was just their fourth in the past 14 games, a run that started with a 2-0 win over Denmark in Belfast in November 2023.

In losses to Spain 12 months ago and against Sweden in March, Northern Ireland shipped five goals but, despite their largely stout defending representing a sign of progress in Copenhagen, the game against Iceland will pose a different challenge.

The visitors, however, arrive in Belfast buoyed by a victory over Scotland on Friday night.

"We need to be better with the ball. So how we set ourselves out as a team will be slightly different," O'Neill said.

"The teams are more of a similar level, let's be honest, so that in itself will help us, although they had a very good result against Scotland at Hampden Park and played very well.

"So it will be a tough test, but it's just a different game for us. It's a game where we will expect to have more of the ball and the responsibility and the onus is on us to obviously take the initiative in the game."

While replacing goalkeeper Conor Hazard at half-time was the only Northern Ireland change forced through injury at Parken Stadium, O'Neill said he had made other substitutions to "protect" those carrying knocks after long club seasons.

Against Iceland, such concerns will play into team selection but the manager said there will not be wholesale changes for what is their last game before 2026 World Cup qualifying begins away to Luxembourg in September.

"We'll have to make one or two changes but it's important that we have to use the game wisely as well.

"We're not here just to give people minutes for the sake of doing it, they have to earn it as well, so I think we look at how we come through [against Denmark], we'll make I think one or two changes but it won't be massive."

Let's dive into the details: Wallace played for GB at the Paris Olympics

The England men's and women's hockey teams both failed to win their opening games in the London leg of the Pro League.

The men were held to a 2-2 draw against Germany before losing 4-3 on penalties, while the women were defeated 3-1 by Argentina.

England's men twice fought back from behind as Zach Wallace and Stuart Rushmere cancelled out goals from Benedikt Schwarzhaupt and Linus Muller.

However, Rushmere and Tom Sorsby missed in the shootout as Olympic silver medallists Germany earned the bonus point which puts them sixth in the standings, two places below England.

The two will face off again on Sunday at 12:45 BST.

In the women's match, Agustina Gorzelany gave second-placed Argentina an early lead against England, with Katie Curtis equalising late in the first period.

Gorzelany made it 2-1 in the second period and although England, who are bottom of the table, tried to get back into the game, a late Julieta Jankunas strike secured the win for Argentina, with the sides up against each other again on Sunday (15:00).

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Hugo Keenan has won 46 caps for Ireland and three for the British and Irish Lions

Full-back Hugo Keenan will miss Ireland's November schedule after having hip surgery following the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia.

Keenan, 29, scored the winning try in the second Test that clinched a series victory for Andy Farrell's men over the Wallabies this summer. 

The Leinster player had, however, travelled with a pre-existing hip issue and will now miss his side's start to the United Rugby Championship (URC) season, as well as Ireland's November Tests against New Zealand, Japan, Australia and South Africa. 

Keenan's injury is not the only absence Leinster will be dealing with in the early part of the season. 

Lock Joe McCarthy is also a doubt for Ireland's autumn fixtures because of the foot problem he sustained on that summer tour down under.

Number eight Caelan Doris, who missed the Lions series with a shoulder injury suffered against Northampton Saints in May's Champions Cup semi-final, is expected to return before Christmas.

The remainder of Leinster's Lions contingent returned to training last week.

Leo Cullen's side start their URC title defence against the Stormers in Cape Town on Friday, 26 September.

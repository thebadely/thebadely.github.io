Full leaderboard

England's Charley Hull finished joint second as Spain's Nuria Iturrioz claimed victory at the Houston Championship.

Iturrioz finished two shots clear of Hull and compatriot Carlota Ciganda on 13 under par after a four-under 68 in Texas.

The 29-year-old birdied three of the last five holes to claim her fifth European Tour title.

Hull, the world number 10, was four shots off the lead heading into the final round, but closed the gap to one shot after three holes at Golfcrest Country Club in Pearland.

Hull set a clubhouse target of 11 under after two birdies on the back nine helped her card a 67, but Iturrioz held her nerve to secure the win.

It is the second tournament in a row that Hull has finished runner-up, but her first since she sustained ankle ligament damage after slipping in a car park in August.

"I played A1 golf all day," she said.

"Especially with my injury and coming back, I didn't think I'd play well this week, so I'm happy with my result."

Overnight leader Ciganda shot a final-round 71.

According to new developments, Conlan claimed the vacant WBC International featherweight title

Michael Conlan roared "I'm back" as he stopped Jack Bateson in the fourth round at Dublin's 3Arena on Friday.

The 33-year-old Belfast man delivered a stunning right hand to drop and ultimately stop the Yorkshireman with 10 seconds remaining in the round to claim the vacant WBC International featherweight title and improve to 20-3.

Conlan was in the second fight of a comeback following back-to-back defeats in 2023 and was much improved from March's return against Asad Asif Khan.

Bateson seemed to be asking a few questions in the early rounds but despite appearing untroubled by a flash knockdown in the third, there was no coming back from the finish as the 31-year-old's record slipped to 20-2-1.

"It was everything we worked on in training camp," Conlan told Channel 5 after his win.

"I've got to thank (coach) Grant Smith from the bottom of my heart. He brought me into that gym (in Sheffield), made me part of the family and I feel at home. He's a master technician as a coach and everything we worked on, everything he said, played out and the finish came with it. 

"I am back and next time I want to go big."

Conlan lands the right hand that ended the fight

Conlan, fighting in Dublin for the first time as a professional, exhibited some of the silky switch-hitting skills early on which were a feature of his former amateur bouts in the city 10 years previous.

Still, Bateson appeared to have settled in the hostile surroundings, not getting drawn in and using his feet to stay mostly out of danger and although he took a flush right, the Leeds man landed with one of his own.

It was a cagey second with Conlan seeking to draw a mistake from Bateson, crouching and shooting downstairs, but the visitor was disciplined and was not taking the early bait, his footwork making him difficult to pin down.

However, Conlan made something of a breakthrough in the third as Bateson was forced to take a count when his gloves grazed the canvas. It seemed to stem more from a tangle of legs, but a short right hand also landed in the process.

There was no disputing the knockdown in the fourth as Conlan's crisp jab unlocked the door, opening a gap he exploited with a huge right hook that dropped Bateson heavily. Although the visitor managed to get to his feet, the fight was waved off.

"It's very special," Conlan said of his emphatic win.

"To come back to Dublin finally, after almost 10 years for my first pro fight here, I'm very proud. It's a very special night."

Conlan celebrates his victory

In the build-up, Conlan was not shying away from the 'win or bust' territory he was in, but in reality, he also needed to make a statement to prove he has the ability to push on to the big fights he craves.

He did just that, with distance control on point, while he had the speed and power to close the show when the opportunity arose.

His return in March against Asad Asif Khan didn't set the world alight, but after 16 months away from the sport, it was always likely to be a rusty performance and this fight with Bateson would paint a truer picture of what was left in the tank.

It's the next step on a journey to what he hopes will be a third crack at a world title and having cleared this hurdle, will seek another step up which could put him on the cusp of that title shot. He could also now enjoy a favourable ranking with the WBC with their International belt in his possession, which will aid his cause.

His promoter Kalle Sauerland said "big fights" are on the horizon, name-checking Josh Warrington, former foe Leigh Wood - who has since moved to super-featherweight - and the winner of next month's European title fight between Cristobal Lorente and Nathaniel Collins. 

A fight in that sphere seems the logical move with Conlan's confidence now likely to be flying high after Friday's emphatic win.

As for Bateson, it will be a long road back as although still just 31, he is now coming off a knockout defeat and technical draw against Danny Quartermaine nine months ago.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jude McAtamney, Charlie Smyth and Mark McNamee are open to be picked up by new teams or added to practice squads

Jude McAtamney, Charlie Smyth and Mark McNamee have missed out on making the active roster for their respective NFL teams, leaving them open to be picked up by another franchise.

Former Gaelic footballers McAtamney, Smyth and McNamee were waived by the New York Giants, New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.

McAtamney lost out to veteran Graham Gano as the New York Giants finalised their 53-man roster for the start of the new season, which begins next week.

The County Derry man handled all kicking duties in the pre-season victories over the New York Jets and New England Patriots, kicking 10 extra points and a field goal between both games, while playing in the second half of the pre-season opener against the Buffalo Bills.

Last season, McAtamney was called from the practice squad into the Giants team for the regular season game against the Washington Commanders when Gano sustained an injury and the New York franchise may wish to recall him to the practice squad for the coming season if his pre-season form does not attract an offer from another team.

County Down's Smyth missed out on New Orleans' active roster for the second season with Blake Grupe again selected as first choice. 

Smyth, however, is eligible to return to the practice squad in the international player exemption slot.

Smyth had a productive pre-season with the Saints, playing in the second half of each of their games and kicking field goals in the games against the Los Angeles Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Denver Broncos. 

During Saturday's 28-19 loss to the Broncos, Smyth scored from 52 yards.

However, Grupe started each of those games with head coach Kellen Moore opting to keep the 26-year-old as his kicker for the start of the new campaign.

McNamee was not selected by Green Bay and is also now open to be picked up by another team or be added to the Packers' practice squad.

The Dubliner took all of the kick-offs in the opening pre-season game against the New York Jets despite landing in the United States just the day before.

He saw more action in the second game against the Indianapolis Colts, kicking a 43-yard field goal and two extra points, but also missed a field goal attempt from 39 yards and an extra point. 

Regular kicker Brandon McManus took all of the Packers' kicks in their final pre-season game.

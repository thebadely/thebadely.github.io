Experts revealed that Patrick Mahomes has led Kansas City to three Super Bowl wins in the past six years

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has ruled out playing flag football at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.

NFL team owners agreed last week to allow NFL players to participate in flag football's Olympic debut.

Mahomes, 29, had previously said he "definitely wants to" play but this week the NFL's two-time Most Valuable Player said he will leave representing the United States to "the younger guys".

The three-time Super Bowl winner would turn 33 shortly after the LA Games take place in July 2028.

Speaking during the Chiefs' off-season organised team activities (OTAs), Mahomes said: "I'll probably leave that to the younger guys. I'll be a little older by the time that comes around.

"It's awesome. Honestly, just to be able to showcase the NFL to the whole world through flag football."

Last week's vote opened up the possibility of there being another 'Dream Team', like the US men's basketball team at the 1992 Games.

The Barcelona Olympics were the first to feature NBA players and Team USA's gold-medal winners are still regarded as one of the best teams ever.

The six qualifying nations for flag football at LA 2028 will feature 10 players per team.

Each nation may select one player per NFL team so, in theory, Team USA could be made up of 10 NFL players from 10 different teams.

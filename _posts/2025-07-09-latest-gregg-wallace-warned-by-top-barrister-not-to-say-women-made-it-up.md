According to new developments, Gregg Wallace has been warned by one of the country's most senior barristers not to say the women coming forward with claims against him are making things up.

The comments from Baroness Helena Kennedy, who chairs a watchdog aimed at improving standards of behaviour in the creative industries, come after 50 more people contacted BBC News with claims about the TV presenter, which he denies.

An inquiry into allegations of misconduct against him, conducted by an independent law firm on behalf of MasterChef's production company Banijay, is expected to report back imminently.

BBC News has not seen that report, but Wallace insisted it had cleared him of "the most serious and sensational allegations".

His comments came as it emerged that he had been sacked as MasterChef presenter as a result of the inquiry into alleged misconduct.

As the face of BBC One cooking show MasterChef, Gregg Wallace, 60, was one of the most high-profile presenters on British television for 20 years. 

Defending himself on Tuesday, Wallace said he had been hired "as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all". 

In an interview with Newsnight, Baroness Kennedy said the public might have enjoyed watching the cheeky chappy but they had not seen his "uglier side". 

She said if she had one bit of advice for the presenter, it would be not to dismiss the women's claims.

"There may be an opportunity for you to make a comeback at some point but don't say that all of these women have made this stuff up and don't say that it's all invented," she said.

Baroness Kennedy also criticised managers across the TV industry for not dealing early on with concerns relating to the MasterChef presenter.

She said that if managers employed people who did not know how to behave, they had a responsibility to take them to one side, and nip issues in the bud as soon as possible. 

"That was not done," she added.

Wallace stepped aside from MasterChef in November after our initial investigation at the end of last year, when 13 people accused him of making inappropriate sexual comments.

The new claims come from people who say they encountered him across a range of shows and settings.

The majority say he made inappropriate sexual comments, while 11 women accuse him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, such as groping and touching.

One woman says Wallace took his trousers down in front of her in a dressing room, in what she described as "disgusting and predatory" behaviour.

Another says she was left feeling "absolutely horrified" and "quite sick" when he groped her.

Other people who contacted us with new claims about the presenter include:

The allegations raise fresh questions for the BBC and the other companies he worked for about their safeguarding practices and duty of care.

On Tuesday, Wallace wrote a lengthy Instagram post in which he said the "most damaging claims" against him "were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six month investigation".

He added: "I will not go quietly. I will not be cancelled for convenience. I was tried by media and hung out to dry well before the facts were established."

He accused the BBC of "peddling baseless and sensationalised gossip masquerading as properly corroborated stories".

Banijay UK said: "While the external investigation is ongoing, we won't be commenting on individual allegations. We encourage anyone wishing to raise issues or concerns to contact us in confidence."

A BBC spokesperson said: "Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace.

"We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published."

According to new developments, Il Etait Temps beat Jonbon in the Celebration Chase in April

Il Etait Temps claimed a sixth Grade One victory with a dominant win in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown.

Trained by Willie Mullins, the seven-year-old favourite cruised to victory by nine lengths to claim a seventh win in nine chase starts.

Jonbon, who won the past two editions, was second and L'Eau Du Sud third.

Jockey Paul Townend told ITV Racing: "He's tiny, isn't he? But he answered every question I asked of him today.

"He's living up to all the promise he showed as a young horse. He's so straightforward now and so tough."

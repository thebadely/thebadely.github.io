Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Lewis Hamilton adopted Roscoe in 2013

Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton has pulled out of a Formula 1 tyre test with Pirelli to be with his dog Roscoe, who is in a coma.

Britain's seven-time world champion said his 12-year-old bulldog was in hospital with pneumonia.

Hamilton, 40, said the dog was sedated while they did checks and during that process his heart stopped.

Writing on Instagram, external alongside pictures of himself by Roscoe's bedside, Hamilton said: "They managed to get a heartbeat back and now he's in a coma. We don't know whether he will wake from this. Tomorrow we'll try to wake him up. I'm by his side and want to thank you all for your prayers and support."

Hamilton had been due to attend Italy's Mugello track on Friday to test how the prototype tyres perform but has been replaced by Chinese reserve Zhou Guanyu.

Roscoe, who has 1.3m followers on Instagram, is described in his profile as "a vegan bulldog that loves to travel and play ball". He is often seen with Hamilton at races.

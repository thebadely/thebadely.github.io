Experts revealed that A 21-year-old living with stage three endometriosis said a support group has helped her to feel less lonely.

Mia Harrison, who lives in Bristol, has suffered with the condition since she was 12-years-old. Every month, she is left with "all encompassing" pain affecting her legs, stomach, back and head.

Over the years, Ms Harrison has undergone two surgeries and trialled different contraception methods, diets and exercise plans, but has found nothing to drastically ease her pain.

"It's not just painful periods, it's so much more than that. It controls every single aspect of my life, from my work, university, my friendships, relationships, my mental health," she said.

Ms Harrison spent seven years trying to understand why she experienced more pain during her periods compared to any of her friends or family members.

She was dismissed by many doctors who told her that painful periods are normal, that she has a low pain tolerance and she was "too young" to have a condition like endometriosis.

"I started to feel like I was going crazy and I was making it up in my head," she said.

Endometriosis causes cells similar to those in the lining of the womb to grow in other parts of the body, leading to severe pain.

There is no cure for it.

Ms Harrison said the condition is "really difficult" to live with and leaves her feeling anxious about making plans in case she has to cancel them at the last minute.

"It's really difficult to explain to people who have never gone through it."

She hopes that talking about the condition and raising awareness of it will help others dealing with it and help to validate those who have not yet figured out the cause of their pain.

"I empathise with people that really struggle with the pain but don't know why.

"It's such a lonely place to be," she added.

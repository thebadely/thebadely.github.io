It has been recently reported that Jack Draper said on social media he was 'looking forward to getting back out there in 2026'

British number one Jack Draper will not play in next month's Australian Open because of an ongoing arm injury.

The 24-year-old has played just one singles match since Wimbledon in the summer but was hoping to return to the tour in time for the first Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne. 

But in a video posted on X,, external Draper said the injury, which ended his 2025 campaign early, is one of the most "challenging" and "complex" of his career.

"Unfortunately, me and my team have decided not to head out to Australia this year," he said. "It was a really, really tough decision." 

The Australian Open at Melbourne Park begins on 18 January. 

In early December, world number 10 Draper also pulled out of the Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS) grand final in London, citing his frustration at not being "quite ready". 

Draper first felt discomfort in his upper left serving arm during the clay-court season in the spring, and while he attempted to return at the US Open in late August - playing alongside Jessica Pegula in the mixed doubles and winning his first-round match in the singles - he withdrew from the tournament because of the discomfort. 

He continued: "Obviously, with Australia being a Grand Slam, it's one of the biggest tournaments in our sport. 

"However, I've had this injury for a long time. I'm at the very, very end stages of the [recovery] process and to step back on court into best-of-five-set tennis so soon just doesn't seem like a smart decision right now for me and my tennis.

"I've obviously been through a fair amount of setbacks but by far, this one has been the most difficult, the most challenging, the most complex one that I've had."

Draper performed strongly in the first part of the year, reaching a career-high world ranking of four in June and also securing a maiden Masters 1000 title with victory over Denmark's Holger Rune in the Indian Wells final in March. 

Missing the Australian Open swing will extend Draper's absence from the ATP Tour to five months - at least.

The decision shows the severity of the bruised humerus on his serving arm - the bone running from the shoulder to the elbow - and the necessity to avoid any unnecessary risks.

The issue first started bothering Draper during the clay-court season in April, but he played on through the grass-court swing before having the issue properly examined after an early exit at Wimbledon.

When the left-hander returned to action at the US Open in August, he was upbeat that the discomfort would not hold him back - then pulled out of the final major of the season before his second-round match.

Another planned comeback at the recent UTS exhibition event was aborted.

So it has been clear for a while there is not a straightforward fix with an injury of this nature.

Generally speaking, the fear with a bruised humerus is the problem could lead to a more serious stress fracture with continued repetition and torsional stress - which tennis players clearly face.

Draper has been practising for the new season but feels the rigours of preparing for five-set matches at the season-opening Grand Slam are still beyond him.

Better safe than sorry seems to be the mantra - not surprising for a young player whose lack of durability continues to hold him back.

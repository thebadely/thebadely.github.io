It has been recently reported that Willie Mullins is aiming the King and Queen's racehorse Reaching High at Royal Ascot

Willie Mullins is training the first racehorse owned by King Charles III and Queen Camilla to be based in Ireland.

Reaching High, formerly trained by Sir Michael Stoute in Newmarket before his retirement, has been moved to Mullins' County Carlow stables and is due to run at Leopardstown on Friday.

Jody Townend will take the ride in the Lady Riders Handicap on the four-year-old gelding, who is being aimed at a Royal Ascot run next month.

The Royal couple own racehorses trained by a variety of British trainers including Andrew Balding, John and Thady Gosden, William Haggas, Ralph Beckett and Nicky Henderson.

It is believed Reaching High, who has won one of his eight races, will be the first horse owned by a reigning British monarch to be trained in Ireland.

The move is the latest landmark in an illustrious career for record-breaking champion Irish trainer Mullins, who won the British jump trainers' championship for the second year last month.

"We were introduced to King Charles and Queen Camilla at Royal Ascot last year," Mullins told the Irish Field., external

"The next thing, we got a phone call asking if we would take a horse for them.

"He could be a contender for the Ascot Stakes over two and a half miles on the opening day of Royal Ascot. His pedigree is all stamina, so those kind of races could suit him."

Mullins has won the Ascot Stakes four times, including in 2012 with Simenon, who a year later was denied by Queen Elizabeth II's Gold Cup winner Estimate - the dam of Reaching High - in the Ascot feature race.

Whirl added York to trainer Aidan O'Brien's recent Classic trial wins at Leopardstown, Lingfield and Chester

Whirl was an impressive winner of the Musidora Stakes at York to continue Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien's dominance of the Classic trials.

Despite her odds drifting beforehand to 7-2, Ryan Moore was able to send his mount clear for a five-and-a-half length win from Serenity Prayer.

Whirl, a daughter of Wootton Bassett, is as low as 8-1 for the Oaks at Epsom next month, but part-owner Michael Tabor indicated the French Oaks might be a more likely target.

O'Brien saddles Derby favourite The Lion In Winter, who he says will "come on a ton for the run", in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday.

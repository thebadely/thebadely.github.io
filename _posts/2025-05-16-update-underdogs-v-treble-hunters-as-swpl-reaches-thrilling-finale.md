Let's dive into the details: Hibernian head coach Grant Scott and Rangers counterpart Jo Potter will be in opposing dugouts again on Sunday

When Rangers and Hibernian take the field in Sunday's final SWPL match of the season, both teams will know exactly what they need to do to end the day with the trophy in their hands.

Grant Scott's Hibs have, arguably, the easier task. If they avoid defeat, they will be champions for the first time in 18 years, which would be a remarkable turnaround from last term's fifth-placed finish.

Rangers have only one option - go for the win and claim the title on goal difference, having lost the league to Celtic by the same metric this time last year. Jo Potter's side already have the SWPL Cup in the bag and will meet Glasgow City in the Women's Scottish Cup final one week after Hibs' visit.

Hibs beat Rangers 2-0 in their previous league meeting and have also beaten Potter's team 3-0 at Broadwood but Rangers were 5-0 winners over Scott's side in March's SWPL Cup final.

"Taking the game to Ibrox has given that advantage that they can stretch the game perhaps more than they could at Broadwood," said Scott.

"We believe that when we turn teams over and attack in the correct way, get support alongside the ball, that we can perhaps punish them if they are too expansive."

Scott believes his team are the underdogs, even though they go into the game top of the table.

"We shouldn't have any fear," he explained. "Naturally, there's excitement and nervous energy flying around. I've got to try to stay as calm and measured as always.

"If we go into the game with any other motivation than to try to win the game, we'd put ourselves on the back foot from the first minute. If we get to minute 89 and we're level, then the mindset could change and we would allow that.

"We have to go in and play our normal way. It's foreign to us to try to protect a scoreline."

Reflecting on last season's final-day drama, Potter said "we didn't like that feeling".

And she added of Sunday's encounter: "We're in it now and we want to make the most of it.

"I'm hoping our fans will turn up and really get behind the players and the team and be loud and be heard because we've seen what a difference it can make to the players.

"They thrive off those moments in those environments."

Potter believes both sides will "want to prove a point" and have "a lot to gain".

"It's looking tasty," added Potter.

"We've got to make sure that we are turning up.

"I'm hoping that we can pull a lot of reflections from what we did in the cup final. You've got to remember that Hibs will have definitely learned from that."

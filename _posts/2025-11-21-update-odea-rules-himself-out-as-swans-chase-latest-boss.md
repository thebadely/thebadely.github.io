It has been recently reported that Darren O'Dea has never managed a senior side

Caretaker boss Darren O'Dea says Swansea City want to appoint a new head coach "as quickly as possible" but insists there is no chance he will be a permanent successor to Alan Sheehan.

O'Dea will lead Swansea at Bristol City on Saturday (12:30 GMT) following the sacking of Sheehan 10 days ago.

The former Republic of Ireland defender, who joined Swansea in May as assistant to Sheehan, has no idea whether he will still be in charge for Tuesday's home game against Derby.

Swansea initially targeted Middlesbrough-bound Kim Hellberg as Sheehan's replacement before turning their attention to Vitor Matos, but they have so far been unable to agree a deal for the Maritimo boss.

"The club have been totally transparent with me throughout the whole process but they've never had anything to tell me other than the truth, which is they're moving as quickly as possible to bring in a new manager," O'Dea said.

"What I can say is that's not going to be me. I'm not part of the process.

"I don't think it is appropriate now to be part of the process in terms of being a head coach."

Swansea had hoped to have a new boss in place in time for the trip to Ashton Gate.

They had been optimistic about Hammarby boss Hellberg taking charge until Middlesbrough moved for the Swede last weekend.

It then appeared possible that Matos could arrive this week, but Swansea's bid to land the former Liverpool coach has stalled with Maritimo insisting he will not leave them unless a one million euros (Â£881,900) release clause is activated.

Swansea fans have 'heard too many excuses' - Tate 

O'Dea says he has known for 48 hours that he would be at the helm for Bristol City.

The 38-year-old will be supported by first-team coaches Richard Stearman and Kristian O'Leary plus head of goalkeeping Martyn Margetson.

O'Dea, a former Celtic B coach, says the uncertainty could be "unsettling" for Swansea's staff, but insists there is no excuse for the players not to perform against the Robins.

"I haven't thought any further than the next 24 hours," he added.

"But I'm adamant that we need to make the most of it and we need to put on a performance.

"I understand the players will need clarity, but the talent that is in our dressing room, the level of player that we have, there's absolutely nothing stopping us winning tomorrow. So that has been the message to them."

Marko Stamenic has missed Swansea's past four games but played twice for New Zealand during the international break 

O'Dea has known Sheehan since their days playing together for the Republic of Ireland at youth level and says it was hard to see Swansea's head coach go after a little over six months in permanent charge.

"Losing someone that obviously I was very close to both personally and then professionally, to see the work that was put in by him every day, knowing the kind of implications around his own family lifeâ¦ it's very difficult, but it's football," he added.

"It's been a difficult 10 days and now all focus is just towards Bristol City."

Swansea will be without defensive regulars Josh Tymon and Ben Cabango through suspension this weekend after both picked up fifth bookings of the season in the 4-1 defeat to Ipswich 13 days ago which spelled the end for Sheehan.

But O'Dea says there are no other absentees, with Marko Stamenic in contention to play his first Swansea game since 25 October following the sudden death of his father.

Cabango also pulled out of the Wales squad last week because of a hip problem, but O'Dea says the centre-back could feature against Derby.

Experts revealed that George Wendt, who starred as Norm Peterson in the popular comedy series Cheers, has died at the age of 76. 

The beloved actor and comedian died peacefully in his sleep at his home early on Tuesday morning, his family said. 

"George was a doting family man, a well-loved friend and confidant to all of those lucky enough to have known him. He will be missed forever," a representative told the BBC. 

Wendt starred as Norm in all 275 episodes of Cheers, which ran from 1982-93. He earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series.

Wendt's character Norm was a well-loved bar regular, and was one of the few characters to appear in every episode of Cheers. 

His entrance into the bar was a running gag on the show, beginning with him greeting the other patrons followed by the crowd yelling his name. 

Wendt reunited with some of the cast at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2024, including Ted Danson, Rhea Perlman, Kelsey Grammer and John Ratzenberger.

In addition to the NBC sitcom, Wendt appeared in several movies such as Dreamscape, Forever Young and Gung Ho.

He also appeared as the father of a boy played by Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson's Black or White music video, which was released in 1991. 

He had been married to fellow actor Bernadette Birkett since 1978, with whom he had three children. 

He was also the uncle of actor and comedian Jason Sudeikis, who is most recently known for playing the title character in the sports comedy Ted Lasso. 

Wendt's Cheers co-star Ted Danson told People magazine that he was "devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us". 

"I am sending all my love to Bernadette and the children," he said. "It is going to take me a long time to get used to this. I love you, Georgie."

Cheers Boston, the pub that inspired the hit television show, paid tribute by sharing a picture of Norm's spot at the bar on Instagram.

"George wasn't just an actor - he was a symbol of comfort, laughter, and that familiar feeling of walking into a place where everybody knows your name," they said. 

"To George: thank you for the laughs, the memories, and the legacy you leave behind. You'll always have a stool at our bar."

Actress Melissa Joan Hart reflected on the handful of times they had worked together on the show Sabrina the Teenage Witch. 

"He was warm, professional and kind and our cast and crew were gifted with his presence every time. Rest in peace!" she wrote on Instagram.

"Heaven just got a little funnier".

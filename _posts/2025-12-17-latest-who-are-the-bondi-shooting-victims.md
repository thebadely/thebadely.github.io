Experts revealed that At least 15 people have been confirmed dead in Sunday's shooting attack at Bondi beach.

Many were attending an event to mark the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.

Authorities have confirmed that two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl were among the victims. 

This is what we know about those identified so far: 

Authorities have confirmed that a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda, was among the dead.

Her parents attended a vigil on Tuesday to honour her and the others killed at Bondi. 

The family moved to Australia from Ukraine and Matilda was their first born in the country.

Recalling the deadly attack, the 10-year-old's mother said the alleged gunman "just pulled his trigger on her... it wasn't just a bullet from a stray - it wasn't an accident".

Irina Goodhew, who organised a fundraiser for the girl's mother and said she was the child's former teacher, wrote: "I knew her as a bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to everyone around her."

The Harmony Russian School of Sydney also confirmed that she was one of its students.

"We are deeply saddened to share the news that a former student of our school has passed away in the hospital due to injuries sustained from a gunshot," the school wrote on Facebook. 

"Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to her family, friends, and everyone affected by this tragic event … Her memory will remain in our hearts, and we honor her life and the time she spent as part of our school family."

Meanwhile her aunt spoke to ABC news and said that Matilda's sister, who was with her when she was shot, was struggling to come to terms with the loss.

"They were like twins — they've never been separated," she told the ABC.

Known as the "Bondi Rabbi", Eli Schlanger, 41, was one of the key organisers of Sunday's event. He was head of the local Chabad mission, an international Hasidic Jewish organisation based in Brooklyn.

The death of the British-born father of five was confirmed by his cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis. 

"My dear cousin, Rabbi Eli Schlanger @bondirabbi was murdered in today's terrorist attack in Sydney," Zalman wrote on Instagram. "He leaves behind his wife & young children, as well as my uncle & aunt & siblings … He was truly an incredible guy".

In a post on its website, Chabad said Schlanger's youngest child was just two months old.

"He was the most godly, humane, kind, gracious human being I think I've ever met," Alex Ryvchin of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told reporters at Bondi on Monday morning. 

Rabbi Schlanger's funeral will take place on Wednesday, Chabad confirmed.

The death of French national Dan Elkayam was confirmed by France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. 

"It's with immense sadness that we have learnt that our compatriot Dan Elkayam was among the victims of the terrorist attack that hit Jewish families gathered on the beach at Bondi in Sydney," he wrote on social media. 

"We mourn with his family and loved ones, with the Jewish community and the Australian people." 

According to his LinkedIn profile, Elkayam worked as an IT analyst for NBCUniversal and had moved to Australia last year.

He was also a keen footballer, and "an integral member" of our premier league squad, the Rockdale Ilinden Football Club in west Sydney wrote on its Facebook page. 

He was "an extremely talented and popular figure amongst team mates. Our deepest and sincerest condolances to Dan's family, friends and all that knew him. He will be missed," the club wrote. 

Alexander Kleytman was a Holocaust survivor who came to Australia from Ukraine. 

"I have no husband. I don't know where is his body. Nobody can give me any answer," his wife Larisa Kleytman told reporters outside a Sydney hospital late on Sunday.

"We were standing and suddenly came the 'boom boom', and everybody fell down. At this moment he was behind me and at one moment he decided to go close to me. He pushed his body up because he wanted to stay near me," she told Australian media.

Chabad wrote on X that Alexander "died shielding her from the gunman's bullets. In addition to his wife, he leaves behind two children and 11 grandchildren."

The couple shared some of their life story with Jewish Care Australia in 2023.

"As children, both Larisa and Alexander faced the unspeakable terror of the Holocaust," the health organisation wrote in its annual report.

"Alex's memories are particularly harrowing; recalling the dreadful conditions in Siberia where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival."

The family of Boris and Sofia Gurman confirmed the couple, who had been married for 34 years, were killed on Sunday.

Widely-circulated dashcam footage showed Mr Gurman wrestling with one of the alleged gunmen during the early stages of the attack and taking the weapon off him, before they both fall onto the road.

Mr Gurman, 69, is then seen getting up before appearing to hit the attacker with the gun. The attacker is then thought to have got another gun which he used to kill them.

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Gurman's family said they had "become aware of footage showing Boris, with Sofia by his side, courageously attempting to disarm an attacker in an effort to protect others".

"While nothing can lessen the pain of losing Boris and Sofia, we feel an overwhelming sense of pride in their bravery and selflessness. 

"This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were - people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others," the family added.

The Gurman couple were looking forward to celebrating Mrs Gurman's 62nd birthday on Wednesday, 17 December. Their 35th wedding anniversary was also approaching in January, the family said.

"Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void."

Former police officer Peter Meagher was working as a freelance photographer at the Hanukkah event when he was killed, his rugby club confirmed. 

"For him it was simply a catastrophic case of being in the wrong place and at the wrong time," Mark Harrison, the general manager of Randwick Rugby Club, wrote on its website.

"Marzo, as he was universally known, was a much loved figure and absolute legend in our club, with decades of voluntary involvement, he was one of the heart and soul figures of Randwick Rugby."

The club said he had spent almost four decades in the NSW Police Force where he was "hugely respected by colleagues".

"The tragic irony is that he spent so long in the dangerous front line as a police officer and was struck down in retirement while taking photos in his passion role is really hard to comprehend," the club said.

Reuven Morrison migrated to Australia from the former Soviet Union in the 1970s as a teenager, according to an interview he gave to the ABC exactly a year ago.

"We came here with the view that Australia is the safest country in the world and the Jews would not be faced with such antisemitism in the future, where we can bring up our kids in a safe environment," he told the national broadcaster.

Confirming his death, Chabad said that he was a longtime resident of Melbourne, but that he "discovered his Jewish identity in Sydney".

"A successful businessman whose main goal was to give away his earnings to charities dear to his heart, notably Chabad of Bondi," the organisation wrote on X.

Rabbi Yaakov Levitan's death was confirmed by Chabad, who described him as a "popular coordinator" of its activities in Sydney.

He also served as secretary of the Sydney Beth Din – a rabbinical court – and worked at the BINA Center, which describes itself as a centre of Jewish learning.

Tibor Weitzen was at the event with his wife and grandchildren when he was killed trying to shield a family friend, Chabad said.

The 78-year-old was a "beloved" member of the Bondi Chabad Synagogue, according to the organisation.

His granddaughter Leor Amzalak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he was "the best you could ask for".

She said Mr Weitzen had migrated to Australia from Israel in 1988.

"He only saw the best in people and will be dearly missed," she told the broadcaster.

Marika Pogany, 82, was named as one of the victims by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and local media.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Ms Pogany was an avid volunteer and a member of Sydney's Harbour View Bridge Club.

"She was a terrific person, excellent bridge player, and an even better friend," the club's director Matt Mullamphy said.

Slovakian President Peter Pellegrini also said a Slovakian woman called Marika was among the dead, while the country's former leader Zuzana Čaputová said she had been her close friend.

Čaputová described her as an exceptional woman who "lived her life to the fullest" in a post on social media.

She said Ms Pogany had died "at her beloved Bondi Beach" and that Sydney had been her "haven".

Edith Brutman was named during a memorial at Bondi Pavilion on Monday evening, local time.

"Our beloved Edith was a woman of integrity who chose humanity, every day. She met prejudice with principle, and division with service," her family said in a statement quoted by ABC News.

She was vice-president of the New South Wales branch of international Jewish group B'nai B'rith, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

B'nai B'rith reportedly confirmed Brutman's death in a statement to members, calling her a "gracious woman and a devoted member" of the group.

"She was a very clever lady, and she was very, very passionate about dealing with prejudice and discrimination. She was always there, and she had very strong opinions," a fellow officer at B'nai B'rith, Ernie Friedlander, told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Boris Tetleroyd and his son were at the Hanukkah event when they were both shot by the gunmen.

Tetleroyd was killed at the event, while his son remains in hospital with serious injuries, his niece Leia Roitour said on a GoFundMe page to raise funds to support the family.

"Our family is grieving the sudden and violent loss of a beloved husband and father in the Bondi attack," she wrote.

"He was the primary provider for his wife, who is now facing life as a widow, and the father of a son who was injured in the same attack and is currently recovering in hospital."

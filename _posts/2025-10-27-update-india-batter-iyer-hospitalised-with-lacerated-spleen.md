Let's dive into the details: Iyer has made 138 appearances for India across all formats since making his debut in 2017

India batter Shreyas Iyer is "recovering well" in hospital after suffering a lacerated spleen while taking a catch in the third ODI against Australia in Sydney on Saturday.

Iyer sustained the injury while fielding in the 34th over, running backwards to take a catch to dismiss Alex Carey and landing awkwardly on his side.

The 30-year-old immediately clutched his side and received treatment on the field before being taken to hospital.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has not put a timeline on his return but confirmed he is "medically stable".

"Shreyas Iyer sustained an impact injury to his left lower rib cage region while fielding during the third ODI against Australia in Sydney. He was taken to hospital for further evaluation," the BCCI said in a statement on Monday.

"Scans have revealed a laceration injury to the spleen. He is under treatment, medically stable, and recovering well.

"The BCCI medical team, in consultation with specialists in Sydney and India, is closely monitoring his injury status. The Indian team doctor will remain in Sydney with Shreyas to evaluate his day-to-day progress."

India went on to win the match by nine wickets but lost the series 2-1.

A five-match T20 series between the two sides begins in Canberra on Wednesday.

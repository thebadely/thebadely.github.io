It has been recently reported that A library in Dudley is running a Halloween costume swap to help families save money.

Until 31 October, used children's Halloween costumes can be exchanged at Brierley Hill Library, free of charge.

Staff said a similar scheme for World Book Day had been popular.

"With the financial burden on parents to provide new and exciting costumes for every occasion, we thought this would be an ideal way to help our local community," said Rocco De Gregorio, manager of Brierley Hill Library.

"Customers can bring in an outfit that no longer fits and choose another one without the expense of having to buy new."

Councillor Damian Corfield, cabinet member for neighbourhoods, said: "This is a fantastic initiative that not only supports families but also promotes sustainability and community spirit.

"I'm proud to see our libraries continuing to innovate and offer practical support to local residents.

"The Halloween costume swap at Brierley Hill Library is a great example of how small ideas can make a big difference."

The library opens 09:00 to 18:00 BST on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 09:00 and 17:00 BST on Wednesdays and Fridays, and 09:00 to 16:00 BST on Saturdays.

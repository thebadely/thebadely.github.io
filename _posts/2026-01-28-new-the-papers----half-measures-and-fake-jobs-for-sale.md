It has been recently reported that Several papers highlight Sir Keir Starmer's trip to China. The Daily Mirror goes with the headline "the woo dynasty", and says the prime minister will be on a "charm offensive" as he seeks "growth-boosting ties with the world's second largest economy".  In its analysis, the Daily Telegraph argues he is "unlikely to find a pot of gold at the end of the Chinese rainbow". The Sun's editorial says Britain should "of course" have a trade relationship with China but asks "at what price?". The Guardian says the prime minister has insisted the government remains "clear-eyed" about the national security threat posed by Beijing.

"Reeves puts nail in coffin of high street" declares the Daily Mail on its front page. It says the chancellor is facing a "growing backlash" after restricting temporary help on business rates to pubs. The paper says the decision leaves "thousands of small shops, restaurants and hotels facing crippling tax rises in April". The Daily Express says the support is "small beer" for our high streets.

The Times leads with an investigation into how criminal networks sell fake jobs to migrants to help them get work visas. The paper says in meetings with undercover reporters, agents explained how salaries would be paid to make jobs appear real - but that the money had to transferred back to a different bank account. The Home Office says it is "investigating" the "illegal activity", which it says "will not be tolerated".

Several papers react to the government's announcement that leaseholder ground rents will be capped at £250 per year. The Financial Times carries a warning from a group representing 10 of the biggest landlords - which argues the change would "seriously damage investor confidence in the housing market". The i Paper argues that there's every chance the government's changes will make leasehold homes "easier to sell - and worth more".

Pictures of Sir Keir Starmer wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses during a podcast interview feature widely. "Flop gun" says the Daily Star, which explains that he was handed the shades by the host, and then quipped "bonjour". The paper calls it a playful swipe at French President Emmanuel Macron who had been "sporting sunnies" because of a bloodshot eye.

It has been recently reported that Ange Postecoglou is in his second season as Spurs boss

Ange Postecoglou has signalled he will rest key players when Tottenham play Aston Villa on Friday as he "can't afford to lose another" to injury with the Europa League final less than a week away.

Midfielder Dejan Kulusevski has become the latest first-team regular to suffer an injury that will rule him out of Wednesday's final in Bilbao against Manchester United.

Fellow midfielders Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison are both also set to miss the final, while defender Radu Dragusin is a long-term injury absentee after suffering a serious knee injury in February.

Head coach Postecoglou rested several players against Crystal Palace last weekend.

Plans to field his strongest side against Villa to "sharpen up" for the Bilbao trip may now have to be scrapped.

"The reality of our existence at the moment is we can't lose another player to an injury," Postecoglou said. "It's just too finely balanced for us considering what's at stake.

"Look, in a normal world you use this to be sharpening up, but we're not living in a normal world.

"Even with the best planning we're still getting hit with these setbacks. From my perspective I've got to take that into account when considering the [Aston Villa] game."

He may take the opportunity to try new combinations in midfield.

"We've always had to try to find creative ways to cover the absences we've had and we'll find a way to do that again," Postecoglou said.

"There's obviously a few players who will play [on Friday] who haven't played regularly or a lot lately who will get an opportunity."

Spurs are 17th in the Premier League table - one place above the relegation zone but out of danger, and one behind United in 16th.

Both Europa League final sides have endured dismal domestic league campaigns but the winner next Wednesday will qualify for next season's Champions League.

Tottenham have not won a trophy since lifting the League Cup in 2008.

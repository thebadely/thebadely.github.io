Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia remain out, as is long-term knee injury absentee Levi Colwill. 

Fulham have a near-clean bill of health for their trip across West London with Marco Silva confirming that Harry Wilson has avoided serious injury after limping off with a foot issue in their midweek Carabao Cup victory over Bristol City. 

Players out: Chelsea - Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia, Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer 

Key FPL notes:

Joao Pedro (Â£7.6m) has started both matches of the season so far, and in Gameweek 2 returned 15 points thanks to a goal and two assists. With 17 points, he is the joint-second-highest-scoring forward in Fantasy Premier League (FPL). 

Marc Cucurella (Â£6.1m) has created a big chance in both matches so far. In Gameweek 1, he registered a clean sheet and two shots, while in Gameweek 2, he produced an assist. He is the joint-sixth-highest scoring defender overall. 

Joachim Andersen (Â£4.5m) represents good value at his price point. The defender has produced 18 defensive contributions across the first two Gameweeks.

Manchester United remain without defender Lisandro Martinez but Ruben Amorim confirmed that Noussair Mazraoui is nearing a return from a thigh injury. 

Benjamin Sesko made his first start for the club in their midweek Carabao Cup penalty shoot-out defeat to Grimsby Town and could be in line to make his first Premier League start. 

Burnley have no new injuries ahead of their trip to Old Trafford.

Zeki Amdouni, Jordan Beyer and Conor Roberts remain sidelined, while Bashir Humphreys, Axel Tuanzebe and Armando Broja all returned to action in the Clarets' 2-1 Carabao Cup victory against Derby County. 

Players out: Manchester United - Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui Burnley - Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts, Zeki Amdouni, Manuel Benson

Key FPL notes:

Matheus Cunha (Â£8.1m) has been unfortunate not to score this season. He hit the post against Fulham and was denied by a superb David Raya (Â£5.5m) save the week before. Anthony Gordon (Â£7.5m) is the only midfielder to have had more goal attempts than Cunha's seven this season.

Bryan Mbeumo (Â£8.0m) offers goal threat and assist potential. Denied a headed goal by Raya in Gameweek 1, he only missed out on an assist in Gameweek 2 because Leny Yoro's (Â£4.5m) header took a deflection. Among midfielders, the corner-taking Mbeumo ranks joint-fifth for shots (five) and joint-sixth for penalty box touches (10).

With 18 points already, Josh Cullen (Â£5.0m) is the second-highest scoring midfielder in FPL. He recorded a goal and an assist in Gameweek 2 and earned two defensive contribution points in Gameweek 1.

Sunderland will be without defender Dan Ballard until after the international break the earliest following his groin injury. 

Regis Le Bris has no new injury concerns however, with Aji Alese, Luke O'Nien , Dennis Cirkin and Leo Hjelde all still out. 

Brentford have confirmed forward Yoane Wissa won't be involved against Sunderland despite training, amid speculation about his future. 

The Bees have Jordan Henderson available again after missing the midweek Carabao Cup victory at Bournemouth. Vitaly Janelt and Paris Maghoma have also returned to training but are unlikely to be involved this weekend. 

Players out: Sunderland - Romaine Mundle, Leo Hjelde, Dan Ballard, Luke O'Nien, Dennis Cirkin, Aji Alese  Brentford - Gustavo Nunes, Yoane Wissa

Doubts: Sunderland - Niall Huggins Brentford - Vitaly Janelt, Paris Maghoma, Yunus Emre Konak

Key FPL notes:

Reinildo (Â£4.0m) remains a strong budget option. The full-back has so far earned a clean sheet in Gameweek 1, defensive contribution points in Gameweek 2 and is Sunderland's third-highest scoring player.

Dan Ballard (Â£4.6m) was the highest scoring defender in Gameweek 1 with 18 points thanks to a clean sheet, a goal, three bonus and two defensive contribution points. However, he pulled up injured eight minutes into the defeat by Burnley and has since been ruled out for two to three weeks.

Dango Ouattara (Â£6.0m) made a dream debut for Brentford in Gameweek 2, scoring the only goal of the game against Aston Villa and catching the eye with his defensive diligence. Just one player bettered his 15 defensive contributions as Ouattara returned 13 FPL points.

Tottenham can welcome back defender Destiny Udogie for the first time this season after the full-back returned to training from a knee injury. 

However, midfielder Yves Bissouma will miss out with Thomas Frank saying he doesn't have "a specific timeline for him" but doesn't think it will be "that long". 

James Maddison, Radu Dragusin and Dejan Kulusevski remain long-term absentees. 

Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola has confirmed that both Lewis Cook and Enes Unal remain out of contention.

Defender Julian Araujo serves a one-match ban following his sending off in the 2-0 Carabao Cup defeat to Brentford in midweek. 

Players out: Tottenham - Yves Bissouma, James Maddison, Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, Manor Solomon, Bryan Gil Bournemouth - Enes Unal, Julian Araujo, Lewis Cook

Key FPL notes:

Brennan Johnson (Â£7.1m) is the joint-third highest-scoring midfielder in FPL with 17 points. With a goal every 78 minutes, his goal-per-minute ratio is the best among midfielders to have started both matches this season.

Richarlison's (Â£6.7m) 17 points make him the joint-second highest scoring forward in the game. Only Newcastle's Gordon has had more than his eight shots, and no forward has had more penalty box touches (15).

Only two players have attempted more shots than the seven of Antoine Semenyo (Â£7.2m) this season. He is the highest-scoring midfielder in FPL thanks to two goals, one assist and three bonus points.

Wolves boss Vitor Pereira revealed his only fresh injury concern surrounds striker Jorgen Strand Larsen, who has been the subject of transfer speculation this week. The Norwegian is nursing a "small injury problem" with his manager hopeful he can play on Saturday.

Meanwhile, defender Toti Gomes is suspended following his sending off at Bournemouth last weekend and Ki-Jana Hoever remains out. 

Everton were boosted by the return of full-back Vitaliy Mykolenko in their midweek Carabao Cup victory against Mansfield Town. 

New signing Adam Aznou has returned to training but still has an issue with his ankle, while Jarrad Branthwaite and Nathan Patterson remain sidelined. 

Players out: Wolves - Leon Chiwome, Ki-Jana Hoever, Toti Gomes Everton - Jarrad Branthwaite, Nathan Patterson

Doubts: Wolves: Jorgen Strand Larsen Everton: Adam Aznou

Key FPL notes:

Only three forwards have had more goal attempts than the five of Jorgen Strand Larsen (Â£6.5m), and only four have had more than his nine penalty box touches this season.

No player has produced more assists this season than the two of Jack Grealish (Â£6.5m). He is joint-third among midfielders for take-ons with 10, and is Everton's joint-second highest scoring player with 12 points.

Guglielmo Vicario (Â£5.0m) is the only goalkeeper to have scored more points than the 17 of Jordan Pickford (Â£5.5m. Last season's top-scoring 'keeper saved two penalties in 2024-25; he has saved one already this campaign and is joint-fifth for regular saves with six.

Leeds new signing Noah Okafor made his debut in the midweek Carabao Cup defeat to Sheffield Wednesday but picked up a groin issue that has made him a doubt for this weekend's match against Newcastle. 

Dominic Calvert-Lewin also made his first appearance for his new club on Tuesday and is pushing for a first start, however Ethan Ampadu and Ao Tanaka are out. 

Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe provided a positive update on midfield pair Joelinton and Sandro Tonali in his Friday morning press conference, revealing that neither are likely to be out long term after picking up injuries against Liverpool on Monday night. 

Defender Fabian Schar is also available after following the concussion protocols, however Anthony Gordon will serve the first of his three-match ban. 

Players out: Leeds - Ao Tanaka, Ethan Ampadu Newcastle - Anthony Gordon, Alexander Isak

Doubts: Leeds - Noah Okafor Newcastle - Sandro Tonali, Joelinton

Key FPL notes:

No player has created more chances than the seven of Leeds' Anton Stach (Â£5.0m) this season. The midfielder has also produced four shots and two defensive contribution points. His 10 points are the most by a Leeds player in 2025-26.

Gabriel Gudmundsson (Â£4.0m) is a decent budget defender. Among his team-mates, he ranks joint-second for defensive contributions (16), joint-third for shots (three), has threatened twice at set-pieces and has picked up eight FPL points.

Tino Livramento (Â£5.0m) has returned the joint-most FPL points at Newcastle with 13, thanks to a clean sheet and three bonus in Gameweek 1 plus an assist in Gameweek 2. The defender has created three chances across those two matches.

Brighton have doubts over Georginio Rutter, while teenage forwards Stefanos Tzimas and Charalampos Kostoulas both made their debuts in the midweek 6-0 Carabao Cup victory over Oxford United. 

Adam Webster, Solly March and Julio Enciso all remain out. 

Manchester City are boosted by the news that defender Rayan Ait-Nouri is fit and available for the trip to the south coast. 

Pep Guardiola also said his side had no fresh injury concerns, adding that he "hopes" to have Savinho available again after the international break. 

Players out: Brighton - Adam Webster, Solly March, Julio Enciso Manchester City - Mateo Kovacic, Savinho

Doubts: Brighton - Georginio Rutter Manchester City - Josko Gvardiol

Key FPL notes:

Matt O'Riley (Â£5.5m) scored a penalty in a double-digit return against Fulham in Gameweek 1 and is joint-top at Brighton for shots (four), big chances (two) and chances created (four).

Danny Welbeck (Â£6.4m) was the top Expected Goals (xG) underachiever in Gameweek 2 with 1.56, after having a penalty saved and missing a chance from close range.

Rico Lewis (Â£5.0m) is the second-highest scoring player at Man City with 12 points. He has produced a clean sheet and an assist, created two chances and had one shot so far this season.

Nottingham Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo didn't deliver any team news in his Friday afternoon press conference. 

Their only guaranteed absentee is midfielder Nicolas Dominguez who is a long-term absentee with a knee injury. 

West Ham have no new injury concerns ahead of their crucial clash against Nottingham Forest with Graham Potter declaring his squad will be "pretty much as we were" (for Tuesday's Carabao Cup match at Wolves). 

George Earthy has returned to training but is unlikely to be involved while Luis Guilherme and Crysencio Summerville are still sidelined. 

Players out: Nottingham Forest - Nicolas Dominguez West Ham - Crysencio Summerville

Doubts: West Ham - George Earthy

Key FPL notes:

Morgan Gibbs White (Â£7.5m) has made a promising start to the season. He is joint-top among his team-mates for goal attempts and chances created (both four), and third for penalty box touches (six).

Dan Ndoye (Â£6.0m) is an appealing differential owned by only 1.7 per cent of Fantasy managers. He scored on his debut in Gameweek 1 and produced a superb assist in Gameweek 2. He is Forest's leading points scorer with 16 and will fancy his chances against West Ham's leaky defence.

Jarrod Bowen (Â£7.8m) has yet to return for West Ham, but it is not for the want of trying. Among all forwards, he ranks third for goal attempts (six), joint-second for penalty box touches (12) and top for crosses (five).

Liverpool defender Conor Bradley is available after training all week. Alexis Mac Allister is also back after missing the Newcastle match on Monday with a knock. 

Reds' head coach Arne Slot confirmed that Virgil van Dijk was fine following the tackle on him by Newcastle's Anthony Gordon on Monday night, meaning their only absentee will be Jeremie Frimpong as he continues to recover from a thigh injury. 

Arsenal's Bukayo Saka will face "a few weeks" out following his injury sustained last weekend but doesn't require surgery. 

Mikel Arteta also revealed that Martin Odegaard is yet to return to training after he was withdrawn against Leeds but is "doing everything he can to make himself available" for Sunday. 

Arteta also confirmed Christian Norgaard, Ben White and Leandro Trossard are all also doubts for Sunday's match.

Players out: Liverpool - Jeremie Frimpong Arsenal - Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka

Doubts: Arsenal - Cristian Norgaard, Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Leandro Trossard

Key FPL notes:

Hugo Ekitike (Â£8.7m) has made a flying start at Liverpool with two goals and an assist. He is the top-scoring forward and the fourth top-scoring player outright with 20 points. 

Cody Gakpo (Â£7.6m) has produced a goal and two assists already this season, making him the joint-third highest points-scoring midfielder. No player has attempted more take-ons (13) and only four have created more chances (five). 

Riccardo Calafiori (Â£5.6m) is the leading points scorer in FPL after back-to-back 13-point hauls. He has returned successive clean sheets, a goal and an assist.

Aston Villa can welcome back defender Ezri Konsa after he served his one-match ban in the 1-0 defeat at Brentford last weekend. 

However, they will have to do without midfielders Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana, who both have hamstring injuries. Ross Barkley and Andres Garcia also remain sidelined. 

Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has reported a clean bill of health on the players that were involved in the Eagles' Conference League play-off second leg against Fredrikstad on Thursday. 

Midfielder Will Hughes - who missed the trip to Norway - will be assessed but Daichi Kamada, who returned on Thursday from a knee issue, has shown no bad reaction to his first appearance since the Community Shield. 

Players out: Aston Villa - Andres Garcia, Boubacar Kamara, Ross Barkley, Amadou Onana Crystal Palace - Chadi Riad, Cheick Doucoure, Eddie Nketiah, Matheus Franca, Odsonne Edouard

Doubts: Crystal Palace - Will Hughes

Key FPL notes:

Among forwards, only Richarlison (Â£6.7m) has had more penalty box touches than Ollie Watkins (Â£9.0m) - and only three have had more than his five shots on goal. 

Maxence Lacroix (Â£5.0m) is Palace's joint-top scoring player with 11 points. A clean sheet and successive defensive contribution hauls of 12 and 16 have contributed to his output. 

Ismaila Sarr (Â£6.5m) is Palace's other leading points scorer (11). Last season, he had four returns in two matches against Villa.

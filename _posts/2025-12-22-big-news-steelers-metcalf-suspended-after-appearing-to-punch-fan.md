According to new developments, DK Metcalf earned two Pro Bowl selections at the Seattle Seahawks before moving to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2025

Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf has been suspended for two games after appearing to punch a fan during the 29-24 win over the Detroit Lions in the NFL.

Metcalf can appeal his suspension but if unsuccessful he will miss the final two regular-season games for the Steelers, although could return for the play-offs.

Television footage showed Metcalf approaching the Lions fan, who was leaning over the railings at the front of the stand, in the second quarter at Ford Field.

He then appeared to grab the spectator's blue wig before swinging his right fist.

"He went over and the fan said something to him," CBS sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson said during coverage of the match.

"Obviously, Metcalf did not like what he said, and you saw the swipe there. No Steelers came over to him and mentioned anything."

The fan, identified as Ryan Kennedy, said he called out to Metcalf using his full name.

"I called him that, and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt," Kennedy told the Detroit Free Press., external

"I'm a little shocked. Everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby."

As the officials did not see the incident, Metcalf remained in the game and finished with four catches for 42 yards as the Steelers claimed a third successive win.

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said: "I heard about it, but I hadn't seen it and I hadn't had an opportunity to talk to DK."

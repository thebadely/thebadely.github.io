Experts revealed that Ellie Kildunne was named the 2024 world player of the year at last year's World Rugby Awards

World player of the year Ellie Kildunne will miss England's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Scotland next weekend after suffering a head injury in the Red Roses' 47-7 win over Australia.

The England full-back was forced off in the second half of England's Pool A win on Saturday and faces a mandatory minimum 12-day stand-down period after showing concussion symptoms.

The Red Roses were also forced to replace starting prop Hannah Botterman, who had to leave the field due to back spasms in the first half.

"Ellie [Kildunne] will go through return-to-play protocols," said England head coach John Mitchell.

"There is normally a 12-day stand down. She is fine. She'll be frustrated because she had a difficult day at the office. She'll get better.

"Hannah [Botterman's] got a muscle spasm, so that will take its course."

The Scotland game takes place on Sunday, 14 September at Ashton Gate, Bristol.

Kildunne and Botterman were arguably England's best players in their tournament-opening win over the USA with Kildunne praised for her selfless display by former England flanker Maggie Alphonsi.

BBC Sport's Rugby Union Weekly host Sara Orchard described Botterman as giving a "statement performance" in that game, highlighting her importance.

The good news for England is they have considerable strength in depth. Botterman was replaced by Kelsey Clifford on Saturday and she went on to score two second-half tries.

Kildunne was replaced by Helena Rowland whose kicking in her previous match, England's big win over Samoa, helped her rack up 27 points.

Kildunne could be available for the semi-final stage, should England get there, while England will assess how long Botterman may face on the sidelines.

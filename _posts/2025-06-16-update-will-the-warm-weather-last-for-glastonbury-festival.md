According to new developments, With high pressure currently across the UK, the run up to the Glastonbury Festival is looking dry, settled and very warm. 

But it's much harder to say what will happen beyond this coming weekend and if the heat and sunshine will last.

If you've been lucky enough to bag yourself tickets and are wondering what to pack, this year it may be a case of sun cream AND wellies.

But for hardened festival goers, rain or shine, it's always been as much about the experience as the music.

By the end of this week temperatures will rise to well above the June average, forecast to hit 28C in nearby Pilton, Somerset. It will feel warm at night too with temperatures not dropping below the mid-teens.  

However, by the middle of next week - just in time for the start of the festival - things could start to turn cooler with temperatures forecast to be in the low twenties. 

There is the possibility  that there could be some rain, particularly early on.

It may then turn drier into the weekend along with some sunshine as big names such as The 1975 and Alanis Morrissette take to the stage on Friday and again on Saturday for acts like the Kaiser Chiefs and Raye.

Patchy rain is currently in the forecast for Sunday for Rod Stewart's "Legends" slot and Olivia Rodrigo later in the evening.

At this stage it's very difficult to give any detail or certainty so keep an eye on the BBC forecast online, on the app, on Instagram, external and on X, external. 

Heatwaves: The New Normal?

How hot is too hot? From heat labs to firefighting helicopter pilots and wineries, we look at how extreme heat impacts people and environments in the UK. 

Last year there were some sunny spells, some patchy rain, average temperatures with neither mud nor blazing heat - pretty similar to what may be in store weather-wise for this year.

Looking back on years gone by the warmest was in 2017 when the mercury hit a scorching 31.7C (89F).  

The joint windiest was in 1987 with tent-destroying gusts of more than 40mph (64km/h). This was also the year with the chilliest night - just 4.2C at nearly Yeovilton.

Who could forget 1997 - known as the Year of the Mud. It was the height of Britpop with the Prodigy, Radiohead and Sting performing. 

The early British summer brought six out of eight days of rain in the run up to the festival. The gloop was knee-deep and mud pits formed next to the main stage.

Ten years later in 2007, with the Arctic Monkeys, the Who and The Killers headlining, it was the wettest year in the festival's history. 

More than a month's worth of rain 60.1mm (2.37in) fell on the Friday and into the weekend. The site turned into a mud bath once more with tents floating on liquid earth. Some embraced the challenge, many went home early.

Come rain or shine the best way to find out how conditions are shaping up for Glastonbury 2025 is to stay in touch with BBC Weather.

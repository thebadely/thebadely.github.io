Let's dive into the details: England are seven points clear at the top of their World Cup qualifying group and play in Latvia on Tuesday

"The stadium was silent. Silent. We never got any energy back from the stands."

England boss Thomas Tuchel reflected on his frustration at the Wembley support for his side after they scored three times in 20 minutes in their dominant 3-0 friendly win over Wales.

Goals from Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Bukayo Saka put the hosts in control, but they could not build on that in a flat second half, where the home crowd was quieter than the visitors.

"I think the players delivered a lot to get more from the stands," added the German  when speaking to ITV Sport. "It was difficult to keep everything going in the second half. We did excellent, we deserved to win."

On whether he expected more from the England fans, Tuchel replied: "Yes. What more can you give them? Twenty minutes, three goals. The way we attacked Wales and we didn't let them escape.

"If you hear for half an hour [it was] just Wales fans. It's a bit sad because I think the team deserved big support."

The 52-year-old has won six of his seven games since taking charge of England in January, with his sole defeat coming in a friendly against Senegal.

Tuchel has worked with his players across three full camps and the Three Lions have now scored eight goals in their past two matches after thrashing Serbia 5-0 in a World Cup qualifier last month.

Speaking later in his post-match news conference, he added: "I love English football and I love English football fans and the support they give, but I think the atmosphere did not match the performance on the field.

"We had excellent support in Serbia, but [here] we were 3-0 up after 20 minutes, we had ball win after ball win after ball win and I felt like why is the roof still on the stadium? That's just it, it's nothing big.

"We will do everything again to be infectious, there's no problem. I'm sure we will get everyone going - it is on us. But tonight I was a little underwhelmed."

Former England defender Stephen Warnock, who was part of the BBC Radio 5 Live commentary team, understood Tuchel's concern and felt the home supporters needed to stay committed behind the team.

"We're in a booth so we can't gauge the atmosphere, but it was mentioned on our commentary about the atmosphere a few times how good the Wales fans were," he said. "To be honest with you, you have to agree if that's what he's feeling.

"The performance warranted a good response from the fans. It's disappointing he's felt that."

However, he felt Tuchel would still retain the backing of the England supporters.

Warnock added: "Is this a negative? It depends on how you interpret it as a fan. Whether you take it the wrong way or whether you think you can do more and back the team more. It's very difficult in international football, obviously,

"Maybe there needs to be more done behind the scenes to be able to create pockets of fan groups together where you can actually start the atmosphere going and get the songs going.

"But if it was me and I was sitting in the stands and that comment was made, I'd be thinking about what more I could do to help the team. Fans do help you and they do give you that energy.

"At the World Cup it's important those small pockets are all together and all singing from the same hymn sheet. Maybe it is something that they can look at and they can help the team."

Don: Tuchel's comments about Wembley are valid but misunderstood. Football fans don't come to Wembley to see the national team; we're not the target market sadly. The tickets are marketed at tourists, families with kids and casual fans. Not noise makers!

Ben: To Tuchel, you probably didn't hear more from the fans because the second half was boring.

Dom: I can totally see what Tuchel means, Wembley never a great atmosphere, England fans brilliant on away days and major tournaments, and even in stadiums around the country. Wembley just doesn't lend itself to good atmosphere at England games, been the same for a long time.

Jon: Maybe it's time more games came to regional stadiums. I went with my son to the Macedonia game a while back and the atmosphere at Old Trafford was electric.

John: Tuchel should remember how "brilliant" England played against Senegal and against some of the lesser lights before criticising the England fans. Big mistake making him coach of England in my view. Uninspiring second half.

Luke: Tuchel needs to chill out about the atmosphere, it's only a friendly where the game was won at half-time. He's in danger of alienating the fans going after them like that.

Jasper: The previous England manager was a penalty kick away from winning a major trophy and many fans label him rubbish...so I don't think having a go at these fans for lack of atmosphere is a great idea.

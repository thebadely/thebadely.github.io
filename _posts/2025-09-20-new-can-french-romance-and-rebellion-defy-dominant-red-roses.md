Unpredictability of France make England favourites - analysis

Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final: France v England

Venue: Ashton Gate, Bristol Date: Saturday, 20 September Kick-off: 15:30 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, Sports Extra and BBC Sport website and app

Statistics. It was the word that kept cropping up at France's new conference on Thursday.

"The stats are on England's side," said Gaelle Mignot, one of France's head coaches. "The stats aren't in our favour."

"There's no other team in any sport with those stats," said the other, David Ortiz, in reference to the Red Roses' run of form.

They are right, of course. Ortiz and Mignot were only confronting the obvious. England's numbers loom large over every opponent.

Since the last Rugby World Cup final, England have won a record 31 straight Tests. They have won 61 out of their past 62 matches, racking up massive winning margins in most. No-one has got within 30 points of them in this tournament.

France themselves have lost their past 16 matches against England, a miserable record that stretches back more than seven years.

In the shade of such stats, belief can soon wilt.

Previewing Saturday's semi-final, French newspaper L'Equipe, external referred to England's dominance as a "new Ice Age"  that "seems far from finished".

But if France delve beyond those headline figures, into the fine detail, the numbers offer more comfort.

Because no-one has come closer or pushed harder during England's current winning streak.

France are the only team to finish within seven points of England over the period, fighting back to within a point at Allianz Stadium in April, and losing out by five on the same stage two years before.

France also average the most tries (3.4), the most entries into the opposition 22m (10.8), the most defenders beaten (27.4) and the skinniest losing margin (16 points), of any team in their meetings with England since the start of 2023.

For Red Roses head coach John Mitchell, France have proved dangerously volatile opponents, revelling in chaos, refusing to die and regularly threatening to spoil the party.

"I don't read too much into an opposition, but I do look at psychology of an opposition," he told Rugby Union Weekly.

"They are one that you will never work out because they can get inspired and fight for everything as a collection regardless of the situation."

France clambered back from 33-0 down at half-time to get to 38-33 at the final whistle at Twickenham two years ago. Earlier this year, they were 31-7 down, but received kick-off on the final play only a point down, before a knock-on confirmed a 43-42 defeat.

Perhaps it is precisely because they ignore the numbers and lean more into magic, that their recent record against England is so, relatively, good.

"It's about how you see sport," said captain Marine Menager.

"If you only look at the stats, you're wrong. The beauty of sport, especially at this level, is that every game is different.

"In a World Cup semi-final, the past doesn't matter."

France will need all that romanticism and rebellion to keep England at bay.

In their most recent meeting, England flattened their barricades with a forward-powered 40-6 win in Mont-de-Marsan.

Since the quarter-final win over Ireland, the power and know-how of Axelle Berthoumieu and Manae Feleu, suspended for biting and a high tackle respectively, has been stripped out the French pack.

Lina Queyroi, who started at 10 in the last eight, is out with concussion. Wing Joanna Grisez, their top try-scorer and metre-maker, has had to withdraw a day before the match

Menager is no slouch, but to shift her out from midfield to the wing, opposite the express pace of Abby Dow, looks a risk.

The reward for France is tantalising and inspiring though.

Returning to a sold-out Allianz Stadium at the hosts' expense would be a jaw-dropping heist, as well as Les Bleues' first Women's Rugby World Cup final appearance.

France's dream coming true would be a waking nightmare for England.

To keep it at bay, Mitchell has backed his established stars. Ellie Kildunne, described by the coach as "our best full-back" despite some inconsistent form so far in the tournament, returns at full-back after concussion.

Zoe Harrison, his first-choice 10 since the middle of the Six Nations, is back in place of Holly Aitchison.

Hannah Botterman returns at loose-head prop after a back problem, despite her stand-in Kelsey Clifford scoring two tries against Scotland in the last eight.

With two matches separating them from the glory, it feels like the rotations and tweaks are over.

England have locked on to a team and zeroed in on their prize.

On Wednesday evening, for their weekly bonding opportunity, the squad had a slumber-party movie night.

Step Up, a noughties film about an underdog dancer having his day on the big stage, was put on the projector.

Half instruction, half warning, it was an apt choice. But if England step carefully and with confidence, a spot in the final is theirs for the taking.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jamison-Gibson Park (left) and Hugo Keenan (right) both missed Leinster's victory in the United Rugby Championship final with injury

Ireland pair Jamison Gibson-Park and Hugo Keenan are injury concerns for the British and Irish Lions before their first game in Australia against the Western Force on Saturday.

The tourists arrived in Perth after a 20-hour journey from Dublin via Doha, Qatar, with head coach Andy Farrell revealing lingering issues with scrum-half Gibson-Park (glute) and full-back Keenan (calf), who both missed Leinster's victory in the United Rugby Championship (URC) final.

Scotland centre Huw Jones has recovered from an Achilles issue though and is available for the opening game of the tour at Optus Stadium.

"We'll see how they pull up in midweek," Farrell said of Gibson-Park and Keenan.

"Huw Jones is good, he's been training. He trained fully with us last week so he's up and running."

The Lions are likely to field a side including players from Leinster, Bath and Leicester, despite players from those clubs joining up with the squad late after their respective URC and Premiership finals.

Five talking points from the Lions' loss to Argentina

What do you remember about the 2013 Lions tour?

Scotland wing Duhan van der Merwe was pictured with ice on his foot during the Lions' disappointing 28-24 defeat by Argentina at Aviva Stadium on Friday, but Farrell confirmed there were no fresh injury concerns.

"We're here to build for what's going to be a fantastic Test series. We want to play some good rugby along the way," he added.

"We'll find out more about each other as we keep on going. Of course we'll analyse what went on against Argentina and why, but that's all part of the journey - to understand where we need to go next.

"It's great to be here, this is what it's all about. We're here for a good time. Hopefully we can start this part of the tour off really well on Saturday."

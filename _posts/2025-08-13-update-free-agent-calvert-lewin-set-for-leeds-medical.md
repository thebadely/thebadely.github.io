Let's dive into the details: Calvert-Lewin scored 71 goals in 273 games for Everton

Former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is set for a medical at Leeds United after reaching an agreement to join the newly promoted Premier League side on a free transfer.

The 28-year-old ended his nine-year stay at Everton in June, saying it was an "incredibly difficult decision" to leave the club.

Calvert-Lewin scored 71 goals in 273 games for Everton after joining from Sheffield United for Â£1.5m in 2016.

Leeds' other striking options are Joel Piroe and Lukas Nmecha, while Patrick Bamford has been told he is "not part" of manager Daniel Farke's plans this season and Mateo Joseph has joined Mallorca on loan.

Calvert-Lewin's best season was in 2020-21, when he scored 16 goals in 33 Premier League games and was part of the England squad that reached the final of the European Championship that summer.

He struggled with injuries and form the following season and in 2024-25 started just over half of the 26 matches he played.

He has not added to his 11 England caps and four goals since 2021.

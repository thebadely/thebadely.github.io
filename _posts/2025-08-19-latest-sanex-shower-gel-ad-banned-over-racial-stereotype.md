Experts revealed that A TV advert for Sanex shower gel which showed black skin as cracked and white skin as smooth has been banned for reinforcing a racial stereotype.

The ad shows two models with dark skin - one has itchy skin and the other has dry skin - followed by a white woman with no skin problems.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld two complaints which said the depiction of dark skin as dry, cracked and itchy "could be interpreted as suggesting that white skin was superior to black skin".

Colgate-Palmolive, which owns Sanex, said it used models with different skin colours as part of its commitment to diversity. 

The brand said it made products for all skin types and the use of different models was to show a "before and after" scenario, not to compare different skin colours or ethnicities.

The ad, which was broadcast on TV in June, shows a model with dark skin scratching their body, making bright orange, paint-like stripes with their fingertips. 

A voiceover says: "To those who might scratch day and night".

Another dark-skinned model is then seen covered in cracked, clay-like material, and the voiceover continues "to those whose skin will feel dried out even by water".

A white model is seen showering with water and foam moving over her skin which has no visible problems or graphics to suggest any.

The voiceover says: "Try to take a shower with the new Sanex skin therapy and its patented amino acid complex. For 24-hour hydration feel."

The tagline for the ad was: "Relief could be as simple as a shower."

The ASA ruled the ad breached its broadcast code and banned it from being shown again in the same format.

"The white skin, depicted as smoother and clean after using the product, was shown successfully changed and resolved," the ruling said.

"We considered that could be interpreted as suggesting that white skin was superior to black skin."

The ASA said it accepted that this message was not intentional but warned Colgate-Palmolive to "ensure they avoided causing serious offence on the grounds of race" in future.

Clearcast, which approves or rejects ads for broadcast on television, said the advert did not perpetuate negative racial stereotypes.

One model with darker skin was depicted in a "stylised and unrealistic way" to demonstrate dryness, but their skin tone was otherwise not a focal point, the agency said.

A second model, also with darker skin, was shown with itchy skin, but this was portrayed through scratching visibly healthy skin and the resulting marks, and was therefore more about sensation than any visible skin condition, it added.

Sanex told BBC News: "We take note of the ASA Council's ruling. Our advert was intended to highlight how our Skin Therapy range supports healthy skin across a variety of skin types. 

"At Sanex, our mission is to champion skin health for all, which is portrayed across our brand communications."

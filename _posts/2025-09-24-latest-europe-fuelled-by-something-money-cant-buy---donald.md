Here’s what you need to know: Luke Donald won the Ryder Cup on four occasions as a player between 2004 and 2012

European captain Luke Donald says his team are "fuelled by something money canât buy" as he cranked up the Ryder Cup intensity with what appeared to be a dig at their American rivals.

All 12 of the American team - plus captain Keegan Bradley - are being given $500,000 (Â£370,000) for the New York event, with $300,000 (Â£220,000) of that going to a charity of their choice.

It is the first time in the biennial tournament's 98-year history that players have received a stipend. The Europeans are not paid to play.

"[The Ryder Cup] is not about prize money or ranking points. Itâs about pride, it's about representing your flag, your shirt and the legacy you leave behind," Donald said during Wednesday's opening ceremony.

He added: "We are fuelled by something money canât buy - purpose, brotherhood and a responsibility to honour those who came before us, while inspiring those whose time is yet to come."

'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?

Earlier, US player Collin Morikawa dismissed the idea that the hosts receiving payment might mean they have less desire than Europe's team.

Asked how much he thinks each American deserves to play, Morikawa said: "There's no number. It could be zero. It could be one dollar. There isn't a right or a wrong amount.

"Look, I think at the end of the day, all 12 of us here playing when we tee it up on Friday, and before this all started, we just want to win the Ryder Cup.

"We want to win it for ourselves. We want to win it for our country."

The payment for the Americans has brought a lot of negative attention, with critics believing it does not fit with the ethos of the Ryder Cup.

Detractors also argue the players - who earn multi-millions on the tours - do not need the extra income.  

Former European Ryder Cup player Darren Clarke has previously said the idea of being paid to play in the tournament "does not sit well" with him, while former European captain Paul McGinley described the move as "a massive mistake".

On Tuesday, American player Xander Schauffele accused the media of trying to make the issue "a negative thing".

Morikawa, who won The Open in 2021, says the financial support means the players can help people they "care about".

"I think the PGA of America is making a lot of money from the Ryder Cup and on that end, it's just to give us an opportunity to either pay our respective teams, because the teams behind us don't get the recognition that we do but they deserve a lot of it that we get," he added.

"Also just to give back to our own communities. We have a lot of communities back home that sometimes don't get the recognition."

Morikawa is the latest American player to brush off the significance of the appearance money.

Scottie Scheffler, Patrick Cantlay and Schauffele said on Tuesday they would be donating the full $500,000 to charity.

Not all the US players have divulged what they plan to do with the cash.

"It gives us more opportunities, I think, to help out people that we care about," Morikawa said.

Collin Morikawa is one of the 12 American players receiving $200,000, with which they can do whatever they wish

Europe's Justin Rose says he would relish seeing US President Donald Trump present the visiting team with the Ryder Cup on Sunday.

Trump, who is a huge golf fan, is set to attend the opening day of the tournament on Friday.

He is not currently scheduled to be at Bethpage over the weekend, but recently presented Chelsea with the football Club World Cup on stage in New Jersey and also attended the US Open men's tennis final earlier this month.

If Trump did decide to turn up again on Sunday, Rose would not be opposed to the president handing over the trophy to the Europeans in the event of a rare away win.

"I'm not sure he's going to want to be on the stage congratulating the team that wins in his backyard," added the Englishman.

"But of course, he's the president, so [he gets] ultimate respect, and that would be a great opportunity."

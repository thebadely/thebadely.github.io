According to new developments, Hampton has played in all eight of Chelsea's Women's Super League games this season

Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor has confirmed goalkeeper Hannah Hampton will be sidelined "for a few weeks" with a quad injury.

England international Hampton picked up the injury in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal and she was left out of the Blues' squad for their 6-0 win at Austrian side St Polten on Tuesday.

"We'll see if we can see her before the end of the year, but I'm not sure," Bompastor said on Friday.

Asked if Hampton was likely to miss England's upcoming friendlies against China on 29 November and Ghana on 2 December, the Chelsea boss replied: "Yeah, it could be the case. Yes."

The 24-year-old's injury comes amid controversy over comments made by former England goalkeeper Mary Earps in her autobiography. 

Earps, who was dropped by Lionesses boss Sarina Wiegman in favour of Hampton before Euro 2025, described Hampton as being a "disruptive and unreliable" character.

In response to the comments, Bompastor backed her goalkeeper Hampton, saying she had shown "class" and that she felt Earps had disrespected Wiegman.

Hampton was replaced in goal by Swiss goalkeeper Livia Peng for Chelsea's mid-week victory in the Women's Champions League.

Chelsea, who face Liverpool on Sunday, are second in the Women's Super League - one point behind leaders Manchester City.

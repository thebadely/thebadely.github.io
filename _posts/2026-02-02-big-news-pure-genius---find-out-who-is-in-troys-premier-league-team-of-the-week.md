Let's dive into the details: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Kelleher has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.

Marcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.

Gabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.

Kristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.

Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.

Florian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.

Alex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.

Noni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.

Habib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it. 

Dominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.

Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.

Mikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.

It has been recently reported that Imprisoned rap mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs has denied a new sexual battery allegation that is being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

The allegations reportedly stem from 2020 and involve a music producer who was asked to attend a photo shoot inside a Los Angeles warehouse where Combs allegedly assaulted him. 

Combs, who is serving a four-year prison sentence in New Jersey for prostitution related charges, has denied this and all allegations of sexual abuse.

"Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone," one of Combs' attorneys Jonathan Davis said in a statement to the BBC.

"He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided—and not in the media—based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations," Mr Davis continued. 

The sheriff's department confirmed to the BBC that its special victim's bureau is in the preliminary stages of investigating a sexual battery allegation against Combs. It said that additional details would not be released "given the sensitivity of the case".

The male music producer accuses Combs exposing himself and masturbating while at the warehouse photoshoot, according to US media. Combs is accused of asking him to assist in the sexual acts and throwing a dirty shirt when the producer refused, multiple news agencies report. 

Dozens of people - including underage accusers - have filed civil lawsuits against Combs on allegations that include being drugged and sexually assaulted. Some claims include that the music mogul made both promises of career advancement or threats if accusers spoke up. 

Earlier this year, the rapper was convicted in a New York trial on two counts of transportation for prostitution. He was sentenced last month to 50 months in sentence. 

The high-profile criminal case accused Combs of running a sprawling sex-trafficking operation and his trial included testimony from stars that included rapper Kid Cudi and Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. 

He was ultimately found not guilty of the most serious charges, which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life in jail. 

"I lost my way," he wrote to the judge before his sentencing. "My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core."

Combs is currently serving out his sentence in New Jersey.

Experts revealed that 'Out of Bounds' technology could clear up contentious incidents in the Premier League

Fifa is testing new technology which can determine if the ball went out of play before a goal was scored.

The 'Out of Bounds' innovation is one of a series which were tested in three Intercontinental Cup matches in Qatar this month. 

Fifa has also expanded 'Real-time 3D Recreation' to make line-of-sight judgements for offsides quicker and clearer. 

There are two virtual feeds, available to the video assistant referee (VAR) and TV viewers, which replicate the perspectives of both goalkeepers.

The new technologies have been developed by Fifa and Hawk-Eye Innovations. It remains to be seen if they would become available to domestic leagues.

What is going on with offside, and can it be fixed?

Should Van de Ven have been sent off for Isak tackle?

Were Newcastle denied 'stonewall' penalty against Chelsea?

The Premier League has produced many controversial incidents in recent seasons which this technology could have helped resolve.

Two seasons ago Arsenal were furious when VAR ruled Joe Willock had kept the ball in play before Anthony Gordon scored the only goal of the game for Newcastle. The VAR did not have the necessary camera angle to prove the ball was out. 

There have been several 'line of sight' offside incidents this season. When Eberechi Eze scored for Arsenal against Tottenham last month there were claims Leandro Trossard was blocking Guglielmo Vicario's view of the ball.    

The 'Out of Bounds' technology uses the same tracking data points and configurations as advanced semi-automated offside. 

It is still only in offline testing but was provided with the opportunity to show how reliable it was in Qatar.

Paris St-Germain's Fabian Ruiz had a goal ruled out through VAR in the Intercontinental Cup final against Flamengo because the ball had gone out. 

Fifa also held further trials of immediate offside audio alerts sent to assistants, which debuted at the Club World Cup in the summer.

This is intended to reduce the number of delayed offside flags in obvious situations.  

In May, Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi was placed into an induced coma after colliding with a goalpost after play continued from a clear offside.

Fifa hopes quicker notifications of offside will prevent such injuries occuring.

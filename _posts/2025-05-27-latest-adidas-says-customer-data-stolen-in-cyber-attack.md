According to new developments, Adidas has disclosed it's been hit by a cyber attack in which customers' personal information has been stolen.

The sportswear giant said criminals had obtained "certain consumer data"  which "mainly consists" of the contact information of people who had been in touch with its help desk.

Adidas said passwords and credit card and other payment data were not compromised.

"We remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our consumers, and sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident," it said in a post on its website.

"Adidas customers will understandably be worried that their personal data has fallen into the hands of hackers who might try to exploit it, so it is vital that Adidas provides clear and timely updates to affected shoppers and supports them in taking steps to protect themselves," said Lisa Barber, from consumer group Which?

She advised people who might be affected to keep a close eye on bank accounts and credit reports for suspicious activity.

She added they should also be wary of unexpected phone calls, emails or social media messages purporting to relate to the hack as these could be from scammers trying to take further advantage of the cyber attack

It comes as retailers including Marks & Spencer and Co-op have been targeted in major cyber attacks.

In their cases, the hacks severely compromised business operations - there is no indication anything similar has happened with Adidas.

"Adidas recently became aware that an unauthorized external party obtained certain consumer data through a third-party customer service provider," the firm said. 

"We immediately took steps to contain the incident and launched a comprehensive investigation, collaborating with leading information security experts.

"Adidas is in the process of informing potentially affected consumers as well as appropriate data protection and law enforcement authorities consistent with applicable law."

There have been several cyber incidents reported since April 2025, with some experts finding links between them.

The BBC understands UK police are focusing on a notorious group of English-speaking hackers, known as Scattered Spider, as potentially being behind the M&S cyber attack.

The same group is believed to have been behind hacks on the Co-op and Harrods, but it was M&S that suffered the biggest impact.

M&S estimates the cyber-attack will cost the firm around Â£300m, equivalent to a third of its profit.

There is no suggestion that this group is behind the data breach at Adidas.

But the firm revealed earlier this month it had faced data breaches in other parts of its global empire - including its Turkish and South Korean arms.

Let's dive into the details: Brighton defender Maelys Mpome left the pitch on a stretcher after suffering a head injury against Arsenal

Brighton defender Maelys Mpome is "up and about" after being knocked out during their Women's Super League defeat at Arsenal on Sunday.

There was a 10-minute break in play after Mpome was struck in the face by a ball during the second half at Emirates Stadium.

Several medics attended to the French defender, who had to be taken from the field on a stretcher, with her head in a brace and receiving oxygen. It was later confirmed she had also suffered a concussion.

But Brighton manager Dario Vidosic said Mpome was with her team-mates in the changing room after the game.

"I just asked for a quick update," Vidosic told BBC Sport. "They said she is up and about, and she is having a shower which is positive news.

"Fingers crossed that she is OK. That's always the most important thing - that the players all come off the field as healthy as they stepped on it."

Vidosic said that concern from Mpome's team-mates may have had an impact on their performance as Brighton chased an equaliser.

Brighton trailed after Marisa Olislager's own goal in the first half but improved and forced several saves from Arsenal keeper Daphne van Domselaar.

But they failed to create many openings after Mpome's injury, with the home side coming closer to scoring in the final moments.

"It's never nice to see your team-mate get hurt," Vidosic said. "Maybe that did play a part, fatigue as well.

"We tried to push everyone as much as we could in a safe way, but maybe it took the rhythm out of the game with the 10-minute pause."

Mpome joined Brighton from WSL champions Chelsea in the summer and was making her fifth league appearance for the Seagulls.

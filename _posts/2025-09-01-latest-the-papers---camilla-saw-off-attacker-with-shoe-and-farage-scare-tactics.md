Let's dive into the details: The Times leads on a report, backed by former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw, that finds withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights would not jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland.

It says the study - by the Policy Exchange think tank - dismisses the argument widely cited to oppose leaving the ECHR as "entirely groundless".

Straw is quoted as saying the report "helps clear the ground" for a debate about leaving.

The Daily Mail focuses on the "sleaze crisis" surrounding Angela Rayner after the Conservatives argued that criticism of the deputy prime minister was being fuelled by a civil war within Labour over who should succeed Sir Keir Starmer.

Shadow cabinet minister Alex Burghart tells the paper it is "very likely" that Labour rivals of Rayner are behind leaks about her personal life and tax affairs. 

The Mail says Rayner's allies insist she is the victim of a smear campaign.

An asssertion by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, that she was offered a place at a prestigious US medical school has been described as "impossible" and "implausible", according to the Guardian.

It says Badenoch has told multiple interviewers she was invited to study at Stanford University in California when she was 16, but academic and admissions experts have said such an option does not exist at that age.

A spokesman for Badenoch insists she was offered the place and says the Tory leader questions "hysterical efforts" to disprove this.

The Daily Telegraph says council tax bills will be cut by up to Â£350 a year at Reform-controlled authorities by overhauling pension funds.

The party's deputy leader Richard Tice is quoted as blaming high fees and bad investments for wasting taxpayers' money.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says it does not recognise Reform's assertions about the Local Government Pension Scheme.

The Daily Express is demanding action to halt what it calls the shoplifting crisis.

It wants police to attend every reported theft as part of its "stop the shoplifters crusade".

The policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson, tells the paper the government's neighbourhood policing plan will reverse a decade of decline under the Conservatives.

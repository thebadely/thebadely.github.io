Experts revealed that Pakistan TV beat State Bank of Pakistan in the 2024-25 President's Trophy final

Pakistan TV broke a 232-year record by successfully defending the lowest total in first-class cricket to beat Sui Northern in the President's Trophy.

Set a target of 40 runs to win, Sui Northern were bowled out for 37 at the National Stadium in Karachi.

The previous record was held by Oldfield when they defended 41 against Marylebone Cricket Club to win by six runs in August 1794.

"I am delighted with my team's world-record effort," PTV's head coach Mohammad Waseem told AFP.

"My team's motto is to never give up, fight till the last ball.

"We have won all our three matches coming from well behind by remaining positive in all situations."

Sui Northern made 238 in their first innings and bowled out Pakistan TV for 166 to hold a 72-run lead.

Pakistan TV were dismissed for 111 in the second innings - seemingly setting Sui Northern up for an easy win - but the five-time President's Trophy champions struggled on a deteriorating pitch.

Ali Usman claimed 6-9 and Amad Butt took 4-28 to get the defending champions over the line.

The victory moves Pakistan TV up to second in the table with Sui Northern dropping to third after four games.

The President's Trophy final is scheduled to take place between 8-12 February with the top two teams after seven group matches qualifying directly.

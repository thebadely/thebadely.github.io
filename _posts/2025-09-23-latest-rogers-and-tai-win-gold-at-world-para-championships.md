It has been recently reported that Faye Rogers has won two medals in Singapore

Faye Rogers set a British record to win the 400m freestyle and Alice Tai earned  gold in the 100m butterfly at the World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore.

Having claimed silver in the 200m individual medley on Monday, Rogers went one better on Tuesday, winning the S10 freestyle in a time of 4:32.34. 

Rogers, who won gold in the 100m butterfly at the 2024 Paralympics, finished 3.92 seconds in front of Hungary's Bianka Pap.

"I was just focusing on swimming my race plan. I still think I went out a little too fast, but we didn't die off as much towards the end, so mission accomplished there," Rogers said.

"That was a big PB and a gold medal, so I can't ask for much more than that."

Tai, meanwhile, collected her third gold medal in as many days as she won the S8 100m butterfly in 1:11.20, with team-mate Brock Whiston finishing in third place.

The other titles for Tai have come in the S8 100m backstroke and S8 400m freestyle.

"I was not expecting to win that one," Tai said. "My fly is always a bit unpredictable and I guess it just went well today. I feel like I'm in a good place to start the LA [Los Angeles 2028 Paralympics] cycle."

Fourteen-year-old Iona Winnifrith claimed silver in the SB7 100m breaststroke. 

The Briton, who was the youngest member of Team GB at the 2024 Paralympics, bettered her own national record as she finished 2.06 seconds behind winner Mariia Pavlova.

Harry Stewart earned bronze in the 100m breaststroke SB14, while Olivia Newman-Baronius won bronze in the female category of the same event.

Grace Harvey added a further welcome medal to Great Britain's tally with bronze in the SM6 200m individual medley.

It has been recently reported that Warning: This story contains details of physical and emotional abuse.

A man who subjected his partner to seven years of violent abuse, leaving her homeless, penniless and suicidal, has been jailed for eight years.

Antonio Villafane, from Tintern, Monmouthshire, imprisoned Sally Ann Norman in a caravan, forced her to wear a full face covering to hide her bruises and spent her £280,000 divorce settlement.

The 67-year-old was found guilty of coercive control, strangulation, unlawful wounding, actual bodily harm and fraud.

At Newport Crown Court, Judge Daniel Williams told Villafane, also known as Anthony Manson: "You worked your way through the domestic abuser's playbook."

The couple lived off-grid in a caravan near Tintern after meeting in 2015 as Mrs Norman's 25-year marriage was ending.

A jury was told the nurse and therapist, now 64, escaped from him in July 2022 after he tried to strangle her during her 61st birthday meal.

Judge Williams said Villafane charmed his partner and pretended to be caring and generous.

In a statement to the court, Mrs Norman said she felt "guilt and shame" about "being led down the garden path" by Villafane.

Their relationship had developed quickly, she told the court, and within seven years he had isolated her from her parents, children and friends.

He would not allow her to attend a memorial service for her father in Edinburgh and took her mobile phone away, telling her it was a privilege that had to be earned.

Their isolated lifestyle meant he could abuse her in secret, the court heard.

She told police she was punched, kicked and hit with a walking stick and made to stay in the caravan they lived in for hours, often without food and water.

She has since been diagnosed with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and the injuries he inflicted have left her walking with a stick because of balance issues.

She recalled Villafane tying her up and pushing her head into a dirty water-filled toolbox until she almost passed out.

He once forced her to stand naked in the cold and dark and "pray for forgiveness", a jury was told.

The court heard he has 15 convictions from 37 offences going back to 1971  including violence, fraud, theft, drugs, offensive weapons and public disorder.

This year, he was convicted of animal cruelty for not ensuring the welfare of a horse.

Martha Smith-Higgins, defending, said Villafane had a previous diagnosis of personality disorder with psychotic features.

In addition to the prison sentence, Villafane was given an indefinite restraining order, barring him from contacting Mrs Norman and those close to her.

Judge Williams told Villafane: "You chose not to give evidence or subject yourself to the discomfort of scrutiny.

"Like any hard work, you left giving evidence to Sally Ann.

"You remained in the dock, relying on your lies in your police interview that she was delusional and you had only tried to help her grow.

"The effect on her is hard to put into words. The effect is difficult to overstate.

"You set out to ruin her life and in many ways her life lies in ruins."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A new Watford football kit inspired by former chairman Sir Elton John will be used for a single game.

The design celebrates almost 50 years since the music icon become chairman of the club, in 1976.

According to the club, Sir Elton, who has supported the Hornets since the age of six, was "heavily involved" in the design, which is inspired by the artwork of his Diamonds album.

The kit will only be worn on Saturday, when Watford host Blackburn Rovers in the Championship.

Made from polyester knit, each shirt features a star design, the Watford logo and a 'Happy Hornet' badge design from when Sir Elton became chairman.

The back of the shirt is embossed with the Your Song lyrics: "How wonderful life is while you're in the world".

Supporters can buy versions of the kit both with and without the name of the gambling company sponsor.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the rock star served as Watford's chairman and owner, famously appointing Graham Taylor as manager. 

Under Sir Elton's stewardship, the club climbed from the Fourth Division to the First Division. 

Taylor led the Hornets to a second-place finish behind Liverpool in the 1982-83 season, and the following year guided them to their first FA Cup final.

During his farewell tour in 2022, the musician played two shows at the club's home ground of Vicarage Road.

He told fans: "I first came to Vicarage Road when I was six years old and I was hooked, I became a Watford fan for life.

"I can't tell you how much I love this club and you, the supporters... It's been so much part of my life, I can't tell you, I get very emotional thinking about it."

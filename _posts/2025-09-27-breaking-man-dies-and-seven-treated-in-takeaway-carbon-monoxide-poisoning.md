It has been recently reported that A man has died and seven people have been treated for the suspected effects of carbon monoxide poisoning at a takeaway.

Emergency crews were sent to a shop in Cresswell Crescent, Bloxwich, West Midlands, on Friday night after concerns were raised over the welfare of a man.

A man in his 50s was confirmed dead, with seven others, including emergency service workers, treated at the scene and at hospital, West Midlands Police said.

A number of nearby properties were temporarily evacuated, at about 21:40 BST. Walsall councillor Michael Coulson said the premises, called Timmy's Pizza, were being refurbished and he believed a generator had released toxic gasses.

Police said they were now working with the Health and Safety Executive to establish what had happened.

Cara Jackson, 23, who was working at the neighbouring One Stop convenience store and lives nearby, said she had seen medics trying to save the man's life.

"There were three ambulances, four cop cars, a fire engine and the forensics obviously came after," she said.

"I did see them doing CPR... I did see everything that happened.

"I don't really feel the best today because obviously I breathed it all in."

Ms Jackson and her colleague were evacuated from shop while tests were performed.

"I didn't really sleep last night," Ms Jackson continued.

"I wasn't like scared to sleep but... the fire brigade told us we're lucky because if we went to sleep last night we wouldn't have woke back up."

People had been allowed to return home at about 03:00 BST after safety tests were completed, Coulson said.

Nearby shops, including a chip shop and pharmacy, had been able to open on Saturday, he added.

He also said he had spoken to three men at the shop on Friday evening prior to the incident.

"I had done two litter picks around the shops in the last few days, including one completed just after 7pm last night, and I briefly spoke to those setting up the takeaway on both occasions," Coulson said.

Four residents and two emergency responders had also needed medical treatment, he said.

Coulson said he believed the generator had been being operated without enough ventilation.

He added: "My thoughts are with the deceased, and all affected by this awful tragedy."

In a statement, police said they had attended the scene at about 21:40. 

"Other emergency services were also in attendance and a man in his 50s was sadly confirmed dead at the scene," they said. 

"Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this devastating time.

"Seven other people - including emergency service workers - were treated at the scene for the suspected effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. Some were taken to hospital for further assessment.

"A small number of nearby properties were temporarily evacuated but occupants have since been able to return."

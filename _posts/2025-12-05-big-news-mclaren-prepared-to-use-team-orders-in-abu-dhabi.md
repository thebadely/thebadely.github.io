It has been recently reported that Oscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris have combined to earn 800 points in the constructors' championship for McLaren with one race remaining in the season

McLaren are prepared to use Oscar Piastri to help Lando Norris' title bid if there comes a point in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix when the Australian can no longer win the championship.

McLaren have operated a philosophy of open competition between their drivers this year, determined to give both the best possible chance of winning their first title.

But Norris has a 16-point lead over Piastri going into the final race of the season at Yas Marina, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen between them, 12 points behind the Briton.

Brown said: "As long as both drivers have the chance to win the title, then it's business as usual and they're free to race.

"If as the race plays out, it becomes clear that both can't, we will do what we can to make sure the team wins the drivers' championship.

"We're going to use common sense, we're not going to throw away a drivers' championship over a fifth and sixth place or whatever if one of the drivers does not have the opportunity."

There are a number of mathematical situations where Piastri giving up positions to Norris could prevent Verstappen taking the title.

The most obvious scenario in which this is likely to happen is if Verstappen is winning the race, Piastri is in the top three, and Norris is fourth.

If Verstappen wins, Norris needs to be third to clinch the title. In that scenario, or any other like it, it is clear that McLaren would ask Piastri to cede position to Norris.

Another would be if Norris was eighth, Verstappen was second, and Piastri was somewhere in between them.

Brown said he was sure Piastri would accept the request.

"Our drivers have always complied with team wishes just as we comply with their wishes," Brown said. "So I have no doubt either of our drivers will continue to race as they have done brilliantly in the best interests of the team."

On Thursday, Norris said he would not make the request himself "because I don't think it's necessarily a fair question".

Wardley stuns Parker - but was fight stopped too soon?

England's Fabio Wardley says he is the "danger man" of heavyweight boxing and has urged undisputed world champion Oleksandr Usyk to face him next.

Wardley, 30, stopped New Zealand's Joseph Parker in the 11th round at London's O2 Arena on Saturday.

The Ipswich fighter is now the WBO's number one challenger for Usyk's crown.

"1,000%, there is no other name I want next," Wardley told BBC Sport.

"The WBO ruling says the winner [of Parker-Wardley] has to face Oleksandr Usyk, and I believe he's a man of his word."

A stadium fight in the UK has been mooted for next year, and Wardley expects negotiations to begin soon.

"The when and where is up to [Usyk]. Ultimately he is the A side in this," Wardley said.

"He can have it where he wants - that's fine by me. Just give me a time, a date, a location, and I'll see you there."

The match-up would be one of the most unlikely heavyweight title fights in recent memory - a genuine underdog story.

Generational great Usyk, who has won all 24 professional bouts, is widely considered the pound-for-pound star of boxing. He is an Olympic gold medallist and former undisputed cruiserweight champion.

Wardley, meanwhile, only began boxing at 20. He came through the unlicensed white-collar scene while working in recruitment and, with no amateur experience, has had to learn on the job as a professional.

"I'm the danger man of the division right now. I'm the one everyone writes off, the one everyone underestimates," Wardley added.

"So I'd hate for [Usyk] to be one of those as well, so take on the challenge."

Wardley targets Usyk fight after beating Joseph Parker

Unbeaten Wardley has built his reputation on a devastating knockout record of 19 stoppages in 20 wins.

While some felt the bout against Parker was stopped prematurely, Wardley has  defended referee Howard Foster's decision.

"I think it was entirely fair," he said. "You have a duty of care to yourself to protect yourself and show to ref that you're still in the fight."

Wardley would consider a rematch with former world champion Parker in the future, but says his focus is now firmly on becoming Britain's first four-belt undisputed heavyweight world champion.

Several of his compatriots have failed to conquer Usyk. Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Daniel Dubois have each lost twice to him, while Derek Chisora and Tony Bellew have also fallen short.

But Wardley - who would go in as a heavy underdog - feels his unpredictable, raw style could unsettle Usyk in ways others have not.

"The boxers who have tried have been conventional. They have come from conventional boxing backgrounds and done things in a very traditional way," Wardley said.

"Me, I'm unpredictable. I do things that aren't the norm, which could throw him off his game."

Promoter Frank Warren has said Wardley could be upgraded from WBO 'interim' to full world champion if Usyk decides to vacate his belts.

Although Wardley would regard himself as a legitimate world champion if that happened, he says he would prefer to earn the title in the ring against Usyk.

The pair have shared a ring before. In 2018, Wardley responded to an "obscure Facebook message" from Team Usyk and travelled to Kyiv to spar the then-cruiserweight champion. 

"I remember getting punched up a lot, to be honest. I was very new, and even back then he already had a wealth of experience and boxing IQ," Wardley recalled.

Seven years on, however, he is not planning to just make up the numbers.

He added: "I'd put everything I have into it. If it all comes off how it should, one way or another, Oleksandr Usyk will know he's been in a fight with Fabio Wardley."

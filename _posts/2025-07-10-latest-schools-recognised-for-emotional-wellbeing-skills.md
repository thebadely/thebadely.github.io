It has been recently reported that Seven Wolverhampton schools have been recognised for their commitment to promoting emotional health and wellbeing, the council says.

The schools were part of a pilot scheme run by the council to teach awareness about trauma, understanding individual needs, how to use consistent approaches and ensure emotional wellbeing was school priority.

They were recognised with an ATTUNE award, which promotes wellbeing and anti-bullying, at an event at Fordhouses Cricket Club last week, the council said.

Councillor Jacqui Coogan, cabinet member for children, young people and education, said it was a  "wonderful opportunity to hear first-hand about the positive changes these schools have made".

The schools are Loxdale Primary, Broadmeadow Special School, Khalsa Academy, St Peter's Collegiate Academy, St Michael's C of E Primary, Christ Church Infant and Junior School, and Low Hill Nursery.

Their efforts have led to "meaningful changes in culture, teaching practices and student support systems", the council said.

Each school was invited to receive their award and share stories of transformation, from improved student engagement to stronger staff-pupil relationships.

Councillor Obaida Ahmed, cabinet member for health, wellbeing and community, said: "We came together to recognise and celebrate the incredible efforts of several local schools in achieving the ATTUNE Charter. 

"These schools have shown what it truly means to be attachment-aware, trauma-informed and nurturing in their approach to education."

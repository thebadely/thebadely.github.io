Let's dive into the details: This video can not be played

Rahul's century helped India to match England's first innings total of 387

Third Rothesay Test, Lord's (day three of five)

England 387: Root 104, Carse 56, Smith 51; Bumrah 5-74 & 2-0

India 387: Rahul 100, Pant 74, Jadeja 72; Woakes 3-84

England lead by two runs

Scorecard

England's tireless efforts were finally rewarded to leave a tetchy third Test against India hanging in the balance after three days at Lord's.

In sweltering conditions, England took the last four India wickets for 11 runs to dismiss the tourists for 387, meaning the scores were level on first innings.

The home side looked set to be defied by Ravindra Jadeja, but after he was caught down the leg side by Chris Woakes for 72, England surged.

Woakes, so prolific on this ground, ended with three wickets, while Jofra Archer's pace deserved more than the 2-52 he claimed on Test comeback.

In the lengthening shadows, Zak Crawley used some creative time-wasting tactics to ensure England faced only one over, bowled by Jasprit Bumrah. Tempers flared, England closed 2-0.

Earlier, opener KL Rahul completed a controlled 100 and Rishabh Pant made 74, while Jadeja shared vitals stands of 72 with Nitish Kumar Reddy and 50 with Washington Sundar.

As usual, England found inspiration from captain Ben Stokes. Stokes produced a stunning direct hit to run out Pant and, in a tireless spell after tea, found the venom to have Reddy caught behind.

Crucially, England had already missed three opportunities to run out Reddy and one to dismiss Jadeja.

Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir spent a prolonged period off the field with an injury to his left little finger.

It is not his bowling hand, so he should be fit for the fourth innings, when he would be important in a potential England push for victory.

India 'had no right to complain about time-wasting'

What to do about Test cricket's slow play problem?

Jadeja caught behind after tickling Woakes delivery down legside

This has been a curious Test, often characterised by a slow pitch, slow scoring and a slow over-rate.

The trench warfare has occasionally been interrupted by flashes of brilliance. On Saturday these came from Pant, Archer and Stokes. The words between Crawley and the India fielders in the dying moments provided the drama, demonstrating the high stakes of a tight game and level series.

For long periods, the day was shaped by the innings of Rahul and Jadeja, who separately but similarly ground England down.

But, once more, the Test sprung to life. If there was an element of fortune in Woakes having Jadeja strangled down the leg side, England were ruthless in taking the final four wickets in six overs.

Just as in their second-Test defeat at Edgbaston, England face an examination of their philosophy. Whereas in Birmingham Stokes' team were not able to bat for the draw they view with such disdain, now they have the task of maneuvering themselves into a position from which they can win.

How will the home side weigh up the time needed to bowl out India on this pitch in the second innings against the target they are able to set?

'He thinks he's got it!' Stokes with stunning run-out to remove Pant

In such gruelling conditions, on such a docile pitch, it is to England's credit they maintained their energy throughout the day.

Archer bowled some rapid spells in the afternoon session, at one point going 15 consecutive deliveries over 90mph, while Stokes bowled with similar hostility.

The captain's run out of Pant came from nothing. In the final over before lunch, Pant was attempting to give the strike to Rahul to allow him to move to three figures. Stokes, in the covers, swooped and threw off-balance at the bowler's end, catching the trundling Pant short of his ground.

England needed more of the same in the afternoon. Brydon Carse missed a shy at the stumps when Jadeja was on three, before Reddy's triple reprieve. Twice he could have been run out on nought, Ollie Pope missing on both occasions, then Ben Duckett was off target when Reddy had 18.

The home side missed Bashir, who drew Rahul into an edge to slip. Jadeja, on 23, belted one back on the full, no more than a half-chance. Bashir immediately went for treatment and spent half the day off the field.

Woakes has a peerless record on this ground, yet this slow pitch has hindered his effectiveness. The wicket of Jadeja owed much to the diving catch of Jamie Smith, who has had a superb game behind the stumps.

Akash Deep edged Carse, with Harry Brook taking a sharp one-handed catch at second slip, Bumrah nicked Woakes behind and Sundar skied Archer.

India's batters are torturing England in this series. This is their fifth consecutive total in excess of 350. From 145-3 overnight, 242 behind, India could have conceded a significant first-innings lead, yet end the day with the chance to put England under pressure on Sunday.

Rahul and Pant added 141 untroubled runs in the morning session before Pant engineered his own downfall. The left-hander was fit to bat after suffering a finger injury keeping wicket and, amid some careful defence, played his trademark flips, slaps and scoops.

For Rahul, a faultless century made him only the fourth overseas opener to make two tons on this ground. It was a rare lapse in concentration that resulted in the tame edge off Bashir.

India were in danger when Reddy joined Jadeja and, bar the chaotic running, the all-rounders edged the tourists towards parity. Reddy came through a nasty blow to the head off Stokes on 23.

Jadeja completed his third successive half-century and launched Joe Root's off spin down the ground for six. He appeared immovable, but the leg-side tickle off Woakes altered the momentum once more.

England bowling coach Tim Southee, speaking to BBC Sport: "Pretty even. You toil away for three days and you sit here with a two-run lead. Looking forward to a two-day shoot-out.

India batter KL Rahul, speaking to BBC Sport: "I understand from an opening batter's point of view, it's something that happens a lot, quite a lot of theatrics at the end.

"I sometimes sit and think about if things have changed, but the only answer I've come to is that I'm just getting runs now. My mindset has always been the same, I've always been hungry to score runs, hungry to perform."

Former England bowler Steven Finn on Test Match Special: "The end was great, you wait six and half hours of play for something as captivating as that.

"It sets up a beautiful first hour tomorrow morning because India are going to come with some gumption."

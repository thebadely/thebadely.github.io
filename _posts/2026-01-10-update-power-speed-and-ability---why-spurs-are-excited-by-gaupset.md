Here’s what you need to know: Signe Gaupset is one of five signings Tottenham have made in the January transfer window

With Signe Gaupset in contention to make her debut this weekend, Tottenham Hotspur fans may finally see what all the hype is about.

The Norway midfielder has joined from Brann and manager Martin Ho confirmed she is ready to face Leicester City in the Women's Super League on Sunday (12:00 GMT). 

Widely regarded as one of the world's best young talents, the 20-year-old was lured to Spurs by former Brann boss Ho with a deal agreed in November.

Gaupset clearly made an impression on Ho because he continued to monitor her performances and progress when he left the Toppserien in July to take up his current role. 

She was named Toppserien Player of the Season for her 15 goals and 14 assists across 26 league games in 2024-25 and has seven goals in 14 appearances for her country, so it was no wonder Tottenham made her a priority signing this winter.

Gaupset also caught the eye of Lyon and Real Madrid after standout performances for Norway at Euro 2025 - a year after breaking into the senior national team. 

So what makes her such an exciting talent who could boost Spurs in their bid for European football next season?

Amid plenty of interest from other clubs, Tottenham moved early in submitting a request to speak to Gaupset - and it took just one conversation with Ho to convince her to sign a long-term contract.

"She has settled in really well," Ho told BBC Sport. "She is training really well and she has settled in with the players on the pitch. That is where she comes into her own a little bit, she is more relaxed there.

"You can see the level of quality she possesses on the pitch, but away from the pitch she just needs to settle into the new environment and the new culture."

Gaupset did consider other offers, but chose to link up with her old boss in the hope of developing and fulfilling her potential in England.

Gaupset is the definition of a versatile creative player. She features most frequently in central midfield, either as an eight or a 10, but can also operate on both wings.

The Molde academy graduate is capable of influencing play at both ends of the pitch, with Ho highlighting her ability to "break the lines" and "go box-to-box really well".

"She played as an eight or a 10 when I was at Brann," he said. "That was depending on how we set up, but longer term I think she will be more of an eight because of her power, speed and ability to carry the ball."

In addition, club sources say Gaupset is a highly intelligent 20-year-old, who has a different mindset to most young players and takes all aspects of football seriously, including her nutrition, recovery and sleep.

It is for that reason Ho is "really excited" to see her at the club - and help them in their push for a Champions League spot, with Spurs fifth in the WSL and just four points behind second-placed Chelsea.

Experts revealed that Spain won the Women's World Cup for the first time in 2023

The BBC and ITV have secured the broadcasting rights to the 2027 World Cup in Brazil, ensuring the biggest tournament in women's football remains free-to-air for UK audiences.

The broadcasters will split games evenly between them in the group and knockout stages but will both show the final.

"Extending our partnership with Fifa alongside ITV ensures that the drama and spectacle of the Women's World Cup remains free-to-air," said BBC director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski.

"BBC Sport has been a longstanding champion of women's football, helping to elevate the game to where it is today â a sport experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and reach across BBC Sport platforms.

"From domestic leagues to major international tournaments, we've brought the defining moments to millions across the UK already, including this summer's Women's Euro tournament."

BBC Sport will show live coverage on TV and iPlayer as well as bringing coverage to the website and across radio and social media platforms.

ITV will also have live games on TV as well as coverage on social media and ITVX. In addition, the broadcaster will show all of England's qualifying matches and friendlies.

"The Fifa Women's World Cup 2027 is sure to be another standout tournament and we look forward to continuing our relationship with both Fifa and the BBC," said Niall Sloane, ITV director of sport.

The 32-team tournament will start on 24 June 2027 and conclude on 27 July.

Spain are the defending world champions after beating England 1-0 in the final in 2023.

The pair will go head-to-head again in Sunday's Euro 25 final.

You can follow that game from 17:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, and follow live text on the BBC Sport website and app.

Experts revealed that People struggling with high heating bills and other cost-of-living pressures are being encouraged to use a series of "Warm Welcome" spaces this winter.

More than 20 places across North Tyneside, including community hubs, libraries and churches, are taking part in the scheme, which also sees free food and drink offered alongside a range of activities.

The Meadows community centre in North Shields is among them, with sessions each Thursday from noon until 14:30 GMT.

Support worker Jen Buchanan says it means help is available at a time of year when it is badly needed.

"There are no boundaries - everybody is welcome. That's the message we try to get out there.

"They can have something hot to eat, make new friends or even just charge their phones and iPads.

"We also run craft sessions to encourage more people to come and that helps take away any stigma people might have about coming in for food.

"More and people are coming along, which really shows the importance of schemes like this."

The hubs can also serve as a way to direct people towards long-term help, Ms Buchanan says, for issues such as struggling to pay heating bills, income support or gaining work skills.

"We have a crisis fund for emergencies and can help get someone gas and electric, or refer them to support groups for longer-term problems.

"We've even bought someone new shoes because they were walking around wet."

The scheme is being funded through North Tyneside Council's Household Support Fund, which the authority says is part of a range of measures aimed at helping people in the area with cost-of-living pressures.

A list of the venues taking part can be found on the authority's website.

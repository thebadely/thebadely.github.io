Experts revealed that Liverpool have lost six of their past seven games in all competitions

Arne Slot got very little wrong as he guided Liverpool to the Premier League title in his first season in charge - but it is a very different story in the second.

Despite trying numerous different combinations in personnel, the Dutchman has so far failed to gel his expensively assembled new-look squad together and Liverpool have lost six of their past seven games.

The pressure on Slot increased when his team selection of fringe players and youngsters against Crystal Palace resulted in a 3-0 home defeat in the last 16 of the Carabao Cup.

Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo, Florian Wirtz, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike were absent as the Reds made a tame exit in a competition they had won twice in the past four seasons and were beaten in the previous campaign's final.

Slot now faces a daunting schedule that includes games against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City in the next 10 days, but he has rejected suggestions he got it wrong against Palace.

"This club has always used this competition for academy players as well," he said in his post-match news conference.

"It felt to me the right decision and I've not changed my opinion of that because we lost."

Slot named three teenagers in his starting line-up and a further five among his substitutes as he made 10 changes from the team that was beaten 3-2 in the league at Brentford on Saturday.

"I saw [Manchester] City's line-up and I don't think they had one starter from the weekend but it felt as if - if you look at their line-up - that they had played with their 11 starters," Slot said.

"Maybe that gives a little bit of an insight that everybody has always said how big of a squad we have. When we played Chelsea I said they are missing eight but they can still bring Estevao in.

"We are only missing four players at the moment and already we needed to start with four players under the age of 19. After I made two substitutions we were on six."

After a bright start from Liverpool, Ismaila Sarr scored twice at the end of the first half, with 18-year-old Amara Nallo sent off in the second half to end any hope of a fightback from the hosts.

A late third from Yeremy Pino gave the scoreline a flattering feel as Slot watched on helplessly in the heavy Anfield rain.

"Against Brentford it was two days after we played Eintracht Frankfurt away and I saw a team that is struggling to play three games in seven days, but it is not an excuse," he added.

"I've seen the struggles some players have had in pre-season. It's a new challenge to play in the Premier League and Champions League, three games in seven days.

"Our squad is probably not as big as people think it is. There has not been a change in the way we look at this."

However, former Liverpool and England defender Stephen Warnock felt Slot had no justification for his side.

"Arne Slot has almost admitted there that the squad is not strong enough," said Warnock on BBC Radio 5 Live. "It was very much deflecting and making excuses.

"You're a team in the Champions League, yet you're moaning that you're playing a game two days later. You know that is going to happen. I felt there were a lot of excuses in there. You know your squad depth isn't the best, then your business hasn't been good enough in the summer."

Liverpool spent more than Â£400m in the summer transfer window and ex-Scotland international Pat Nevin felt Slot had shown the Carabao Cup was not important to the Reds this season.

"Arne Slot has shown it is secondary, and it is certainly not as important as the games coming up," said Nevin. "Yes, there will be a bit more stick. There will be a realisation among Liverpool fans, who aren't daft, the fact is they have already won this competition.

"Liverpool have gone heavier for the big names with huge transfer fees compared to a bulkier squad, and it is noticeable now."

Two goals in a four-minute spell at the end of the first half changed the game

Reigning champions Liverpool have lost four successive Premier League games, having started with five wins, leaving them seventh in the table.

Defeat at home to Aston Villa on Saturday will be their worst since 1953 when they lost five in a row.

Asked if resting so many of his first-team players had increased the pressure to beat Villa, Slot dismissed that suggestion.

"If you lose five of six and then six of seven there's always more pressure," he added. "If you play for Liverpool, if you manage Liverpool you know the pressure is there and I don't think it changes much after this loss.

"If you look at the upcoming week coming up, that is going to be a big week for us, everyone and the club. We need as many players available as we can. You can see with the line-up I had to make. 

"I only rested the players that have played mainly in the last week. This is the line-up you get. That shows you we already have a few injuries. With a big week coming up for me, it felt the best choice.

"Combined with that, this club has always chosen in the League Cup to give playing time to young academy players as well."

Although Liverpool's starting 11 included 17-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha and 18-year-old midfielders Trey Nyoni and Kieran Morrison, the line-up also included seven full internationals.

Slot opted for three central defenders, with Scotland's Andy Robertson on the left, England's Joe Gomez in the middle and Japan's Wataru Endo on the right.

Both full-backs have also represented their country too, with left-back Milos Kerkez a regular for Hungary, while Calvin Ramsay has played for Scotland.

Palace boss Oliver Glasner felt it was "disrespectful" to suggest Liverpool had fielded a weakened team and believed his side deserved all the credit.

"It was Arne Slot's decision and we never care what other teams are doing," said the Eagles boss. "I've seen Joe Gomez play for England, win the Champions League, seen Wataru Endo I don't know how many games for Japan, I've seen Alexis Mac Allister, he won the World Cup as a starter, Kerkez moved for Â£40m, [Federico] Chiesa plays for the [Italy] national team, Ngumoha has shown he can score goals in the Premier League. 

"It was still a good team and everyone is a member of the Liverpool squad. I was never good enough to be in the Liverpool squad. Maybe it was not the strongest team, but still a very good Liverpool side."

For Slot, this match will be forgotten about if they can get positive results against Villa, Real and Manchester City.

"If they beat Villa and Real Madrid, and they start to turn a corner, then yes it will have paid off," added Warnock. "If it isn't and things continue, then Liverpool fans will get disgruntled.

"Managers don't make changes for no reason. But when you need a victory, this was the ideal time to get it."

As Slot pointed out, Liverpool's recent poor run was unacceptable and he will be demanding, and hoping, for an immediate improvement in performances and results to relieve the pressure.

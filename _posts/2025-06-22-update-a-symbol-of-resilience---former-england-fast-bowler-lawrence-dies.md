According to new developments, David Lawrence took 625 wickets in 280 matches for Gloucestershire and 18 wickets in five Tests for England

Former England and Gloucestershire fast bowler David 'Syd' Lawrence has died at the age of 61.

Lawrence, the first British-born black cricketer to represent England, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND), external last year.

He was appointed MBE in the King's Birthday Honours earlier this month after raising money and awareness of the condition.

Lawrence played five Test matches for England and took 625 wickets in 280 matches during a 16-year career at Gloucestershire.

"'Syd' was an inspirational figure on and off the cricket field and no more so than to his family who were with him when he passed," said a family statement announcing his death.

Lawrence went on to take three wickets on his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Lord's in 1988.

A bowler capable of reaching extreme pace, Lawrence did not play again for England until 1991 when he took 14 wickets across three Tests and played his sole one-day international the same summer.

However, his career was curtailed by a serious knee injury suffered while playing for England against New Zealand the following winter.

He played four County Championship matches in a comeback in 1997 but did not play again in top-level cricket afterwards.

After retirement he became a nightclub owner and amateur bodybuilder before being named Gloucestershire's club president in 2022.

He continued in the role after his MND diagnosis last year and has been a prominent campaigner to support those with the disease.

In an interview with BBC Breakfast in September, Lawrence said he had been inspired by former England and Leeds rugby league player Rob Burrow, who died from the illness earlier last year, and had spoken to Burrow's friend and former team-mate Kevin Sinfield after his own diagnosis.

When Gloucestershire won the T20 Blast last year, there were emotional scenes when captain James Bracey presented Lawrence with the trophy.

Gloucestershire's players and supporters wore pink during a 'Pink4Syd' day during a T20 on Friday.

Lawrence recently released an autobiography, In Syd's Voice - The Extraordinary Life of Syd Lawrence, which shares the highest points of his career and intimate moments and memories of his life.

He leaves wife Gaynor and son Buster, a former professional rugby union player.

"A proud Gloucestershire man, Syd took on every challenge with everything he could and his final contest with MND was no different," his family added.

"His willingness to encourage and think of others right up to the end was typical of the man he was."

Former England spinner Phil Tufnell told BBC Test Match Special that Lawrence was a "great man" and a "fierce competitor".

"He was a sight to behold coming in with the ball in his hand," added Tufnell. "He had power and determination and left nothing out there on the field.

"He was a great friend of mine. An intimidating sight but with a warm heart and a great sense of humour. He would fill the room with smiles and laughter and stories."

BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew said every ball Lawrence delivered was "like an explosion of energy".

"Syd never left anything out there and he was so proud to be picked for England," he added.

"He was a dear man. He was such fun on the field, always had a smile between every ball."

Former England batter Mark Butcher called Lawrence a "full-throttle, big-hearted individual" who "wore his heart on his sleeve".

"Every time you met him there was a warmth there, a genuine love of seeing his old friends and a genuine sense of how much he enjoyed his career," Butcher told Sky Sports.

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also paid tribute to a "pioneering fast bowler whose career and character left an indelible mark on English cricket" and called Lawrence's 5-106 against the West Indies at the Oval in 1991 as his "finest moment" for his country.  

"His impact on the game extended far beyond the boundary ropes," said ECB chair Richard Thompson. 

"As a fast bowler, he thrilled crowds with his pace and passion. As a leader and advocate, he broke barriers and inspired change, becoming a powerful voice for inclusion and representation in our sport.

"Even in the face of his illness, David showed extraordinary strength and dignity, continuing to uplift others with his resilience and spirit. He leaves behind a legacy that will endure in the hearts of all who love cricket."

Gloucestershire said they were "deeply saddened" by the passing of "a club icon - known for his thunderous run-up, fearless fast bowling, and ever-present energy".

They described him as "a pioneer, a mentor, and a symbol of resilience" and added that "his contributions will never be forgotten".

Lawrence took 477 wickets at 31.27 in 170 first-class matches for the county, with a  best of seven for 47 against Warwickshire.

"Firstly, everyone at the club sends their heartfelt condolences to Syd's family who supported him so well during his illness. As a club, we will support them in any way we can," said Gloucestershire club chair Peter Matthews.

"Syd was truly a Gloucestershire great, both on and off the field. As a player he was one of our greatest ever fast bowlers, who deservedly earned Test caps whilst with us.

"On retirement, he continued to be heavily involved with the club, and was both a supportive and active president. He will be hugely missed."

Gloucestershire chief executive Neil Priscott added: "He was passionate about the power of cricket and how our sport can touch people's lives. 

"Syd pushed us to reach out to communities far and wide and we shall continue to do that in his honour."

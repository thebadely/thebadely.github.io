It has been recently reported that "The biggest sale of the year." "Mega offers like never before." - it's hard to escape the ads this Black Friday. 

Whether you're excited for the seasonal sales or avoiding the shops altogether, one thing is clear - the US shopping event which follows Thanksgiving has been fully embraced by UK retailers.

But research from Consumer group Which? reveals that eight in 10 Black Friday deals were actually cheaper or the same price at other times of the year. In other words, many deals may not be as good as they seem.

If you're still planning to shop, here's how to make sure you get a good deal.

Some retailers create the illusion of a big discount by raising prices in the weeks before Black Friday, only to drop them again during the "sale".

Websites such as PriceRunner or CamelCamelCamel let you look at previous prices so you can work out whether a discount is genuine.

For example, according to Price Runner, the cheapest Apple ipad overall was selling online for £309 on the 19 October. By 10 November it had increased to £391.99. When the Black Friday sales launched on 21 November, it was back down to £309.

This tactic isn't illegal, but it can easily mislead shoppers into thinking they're getting a far bigger discount than they really are, consumer champion, Rebecca Wilcox told Morning Live.

AI can help too, says retail analyst Natalie Berg, host of the Retail Disrupted podcast. "You can ask ChatGPT: 'Show me the best Black Friday deals for a 10-year-old who loves the movie Wicked.' You don't need to trawl through different sites, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming."

Shoppers often hold off buying items hoping they'll be cheaper down the line.

But none of the 175 products tracked by Which? were at their cheapest price of the year on the day of Black Friday itself.

Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth says: "There is a huge risk in [holding out], because the products you want to buy may not be available anymore."

She says higher costs this year means retailers are less likely to have surplus stock.

So if you do find the product you're after and it's at a price you're happy with, Shuttleworth recommends buying it - and keeping your receipt. 

Many retailers will refund the difference if prices fall again. Some companies, like Currys and Argos, offer a Black Friday guarantee.

If you do find it cheaper within the returns period you could always take it back it and buy again at the lower price.

Don't just think about big-ticket items. Some of the biggest markdowns are on everyday items such as quilted toilet roll and dishwasher tablets, Kat Cereda from consumer watchdog Which? told the BBC.

Start by deciding what you actually need. If you're looking for a specific brand, check their website directly and join their mailing list for early access to their sales.

 "The tech is there to help retailers offer more real-time rewards and target their best shoppers," says Berg.

Don't fall for pressure tactics such as "selling fast" or "only two left", which can fuel impulse buying, the competition watchdog warns.

And if you're spending over £100, then it recommends using a credit card.

"You have legal protection that means you can claim for a refund if the company goes bust, your item doesn't arrive, or if there are certain other problems such as an item being faulty or not as described," says Hayley Fletcher from the Competition and Markets Authority.

Scammers ramp up activity around major events like Black Friday and can take advantage of the urgency shoppers may feel. Fake websites and counterfeit goods often spike during this period, posing as limited-time deals to lure people in.

"If something seems too good to be true or doesn't feel right, it might be a scam. Don't rush your purchase. Research the company you're buying from and be wary of suspicious web links," says Jane Parsons, consumer expert at Citizens Advice.

This year, TikTok shop has become an increasingly popular destination for Black Friday discounts, with brands such as M&S, L'Oréal and Rituals selling directly on the app. 

"You can find flash sales not available on a retailer's site," says Berg. "But it's important to check the accounts you are buying from are verified."

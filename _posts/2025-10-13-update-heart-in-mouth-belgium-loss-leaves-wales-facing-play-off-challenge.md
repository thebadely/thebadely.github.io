Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Wales head coach Craig Bellamy (right) urges his players on against Belgium

Matches against Belgium have provided defining moments for Wales and their golden era of the past decade.

Most notably, there was the Euro 2016 quarter-final triumph - the greatest night in Welsh football history - and the qualifying win in Cardiff a year earlier.

Monday's reunion had the ingredients of another classic but, unfortunately for Wales, their 2015 meeting remains the last time Belgium were defeated in a World Cup or European Championship qualifier.

That remarkable 46-game unbeaten run was under threat as Wales exploded out of the blocks, though Belgium soon had things back under control and looked a class apart as they sat back and chose their moments to pick off their desperate opponents.

Now, after this 4-2 defeat, Wales' hopes of qualifying automatically for the 2026 World Cup are effectively over. The play-offs will have to suffice, as they did in 2022.

Head coach Craig Bellamy was unbeaten after his first eight games in charge but, having lost four of his past five matches, he is starting to face a little more scrutiny.

And while Wales are still capable of accomplishing Bellamy's stated aim of getting to next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the route they must take there is looking more convoluted than they would have hoped.

"We knew we needed to win. We were here to win," Bellamy said.

"The draw wasn't going to get us first place. We knew that. We're aware of our play-off positioning as well.

"But to me I honestly love playing these top teams. It's so good. Your heart is in your mouth at times, you're really living on the edge.

"I definitely liked a lot of our game. I'm really proud of the players. And I know that's no consolation to the people who are watching on or the players themselves."

Wales' players were crestfallen at the final whistle, glazed looks in their eyes as it dawned on them that a huge opportunity had slipped through their grasp.

Belgium's goalless draw with North Macedonia on Friday had opened the door for Wales, who needed to win their remaining three games to finish top of Group J and qualify automatically for the World Cup.

But they fell at the first hurdle, outgunned by Belgium in another chaotic shootout after losing 4-3 in Brussels in June.

Again, Wales' bold approach - to press and to pour forward at every opportunity - left them exposed defensively, and once again they were ruthlessly punished by Jeremy Doku, Kevin de Bruyne and the rest.

On reflection, did Bellamy feel his side were just a little too open?

"We felt the best way of being able to combat this team was to have the ball," he answered. "And we created a lot of chances, but we felt that was the way of being able to beat this team because we needed to win.

"It was as simple as that, and you could see even towards the end, we opened up more. We lost a bit of control in the game. But I always believe the way you can stop the opposition from scoring is by having the ball.

"But that transition moment, with Jeremy, it's so fearful every time you have the ball that if it turns over, this kid, he's just that.

"I've experienced it. I had him on my team [at Anderlecht], and I knew how dangerous he was, but going against him... We knew there were going to be difficult moments in that game."

This has been a bruising window for Bellamy, whose decision to take on England in a friendly at Wembley last Thursday was met with a mixture of scepticism, bemusement and outright criticism.

The outcome, a chastening 3-0 defeat, intensified the fans' discontent, though they were willing to keep an open mind if it helped Wales beat Belgium.

Supporters will be less forgiving now Wales have lost - making it 12 goals conceded in five games - and seen their hopes of qualifying automatically go up in smoke.

But nothing will deter Bellamy, who is unshakeable in his beliefs.

"I've seen a lot today that makes me feel we can get close to these. We can get close. We need to keep improving," he said.

"But I told you at the start when I was going to do this. I'm going to press, and I won't sit back. I know that goes against some people, but this is who I am.

"And today, I've seen a team with flaws because I have them. A team that wants to do something, because I want to. I'm grateful for that."

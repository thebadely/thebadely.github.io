It has been recently reported that Ben Whittaker has one draw and nine wins in his career so far

Ben Whittaker will headline against Benjamin Gavazi in Birmingham on his promotional debut for Matchroom on 29 November.

The British Olympic silver medallist left Boxxer to join Eddie Hearn's stable at the beginning of October.

Whittaker, 28, will place his undefeated record against German Gavazi in a light-heavyweight bout.

"Ben Whittaker is the greatest signing any promoter in the world could have made and he levels up from the get-go in front of his home fans in Birmingham," Hearn said.

Gavazi will fight outside Germany for just the second time in his career and is on a 19-fight unbeaten streak since losing his professional debut in 2018.

The rivals will contest the vacant World Boxing Council (WBC) 'silver' light-heavyweight title.

Whittaker currently sits at number nine in the WBC's rankings for the world title held by David Benavidez.

Benavidez is scheduled to defend the belt against Londoner Anthony Yarde on 22 November in Saudi Arabia.

Former UFC fighter Molly McCann is also in action at the National Exhibition Centre.

McCann started her boxing career with a win in Belfast in September.

The co-main event will be a rematch between lightweights Cameron Vuong and Gavin Gwynne.

Let's dive into the details: The Bank of England has received thousands of responses to its appeal for ideas for the first major redesign of banknotes in 50 years.

They included a high volume of ideas from young people despite trends showing they are less likely to use cash, instead preferring mobile payments.

"We have had many thousands of responses and lots of interest and engagement from young people too," said Victoria Cleland the Bank's chief cashier.

It released some examples of designs it has received, including a dolphin, the Sycamore Gap tree - also known as the Robin Hood tree and the Angel of the North sculpture in Gateshead.

"The reaction shows how important banknotes are as way to celebrate the UK and how much we have to celebrate," Ms Cleland said.

The Bank of England asked for public views on new themes for bank notes, such as nature, innovation, or key events in history.

They were also asked to suggest other original themes by the end of July.

"People have engaged strongly with our six suggested themes, and within these have suggested a wide range ideas, from engineering achievements to folklore and mythology to transport," Ms Cleland said.

This public consultation relates to the Bank's next series, which will also continue to include an image of the monarch.

The final decision on what exactly features on a banknote lies with the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey.

Notable historical figures, such as Sir Winston Churchill on the current fiver, have featured on banknotes since 1970 but could be on the way out.

The monarch has appeared on Bank of England notes since 1960. Images of historical characters, starting with William Shakespeare, were first seen on the reverse side a decade later.

Now, the Bank is proposing that designs on the next series of notes could move on to a new theme. While notable historical figures remain an option, other possible subject matters suggested by the Bank include:

Banknotes issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland already carry images of landmarks and animals such as otters. Euro banknotes feature architectural styles.

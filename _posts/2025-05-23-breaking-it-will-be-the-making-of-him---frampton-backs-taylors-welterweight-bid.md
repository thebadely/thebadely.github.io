Experts revealed that Josh Taylor is looking to recover his form in Glasgow on Saturday

Carl Frampton says we will find out just how much Josh Taylor has got left to give to boxing when he takes on Ekow Essuman in Glasgow on Saturday night.

After capturing all four belts at light-welterweight, Taylor has made the decision to step up a division to welterweight, a move Frampton believes the Scot "should have made a few fights ago".

The Tartan Tornado is looking to get his career back on track following back-to-back defeats to Teofimo Lopez and Jack Catterall.

"I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of Josh Taylor, the welterweight version," Frampton told BBC Scotland.

"Light-welterweight was just hard for him, but I imagine we're going to see a rejuvenated Josh Taylor and I'm excited about it.

"It's a really under-the-radar dangerous fight because Ekow is maybe not the biggest name in the world, but he's a really good fighter, strong as a bull, fit as a fiddle. 

"Ekow 'The Engine' is his nickname and he'll be there all night and he'll be trying all night.

"Josh will be in a fight and I think we'll find out how much Josh actually has left in this game after the performance.

"I fancy Josh to win it, I think he'll look good winning it as well but no doubt Ekow will cause him a few problems."

Taylor 'back to drawing board' for step up in weight

Taylor's stated aim is to emulate Frampton by becoming a two-weight world champion, and the Northern Irishman believes the 34-year-old is capable of climbing to the top of the mountain again in a new division.

"I think it's going to be the making of him now moving up to welterweight," Frampton said.

"Undisputed light-welterweight champion, a marquee division, he's done that, he's ticked that box. 

"If he retired tomorrow his career has been incredible, but I think Josh wants to win a world title in the second division, in the welterweight division, another marquee division and I think he can do it.

"A two-weight world champion to go along with the undisputed champion at 140. What a fighter - he doesn't get the credit he deserves."

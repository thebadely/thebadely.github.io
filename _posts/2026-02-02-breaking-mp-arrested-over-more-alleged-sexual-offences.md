It has been recently reported that An independent MP has been arrested for a second time on suspicion of a string of sexual offences.

Former Labour MP Dan Norris, 66, remains under investigation over the alleged rape of a woman and has been further arrested on suspicion of raping a second woman, sexually assaulting a third woman, voyeurism, and upskirting women.

The former West of England Mayor was first arrested in April 2025 on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl, child abduction, and the rape of a woman. Police are no longer investigating the alleged child sexual offences or abduction. 

Norris said in a statement that he "vigorously and entirely" denied all of the allegations made against him.

Norris, who is also being investigated over alleged misconduct in a public office, remains on condition bail.

All the offences are alleged to have occurred between the 2000s and 2020s.

In a statement, Norris said: "I vigorously and entirely deny the serious allegations made against me. They are untrue. 

"I am challenging them through my legal representatives."

Norris was elected as a Labour MP for North East Somerset and Hanham in July 2024, defeating Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.

The Labour Party said it immediately suspended Norris when it was made aware of his arrest in April. 

Despite his suspension, Norris has refused to step down from his position as an MP.

He is now sitting as an independent but has not attended the House of Commons since his arrest. He is still able to vote by proxy.

A petition claiming Norris cannot fully support his constituency and demanding his resignation has reached more than 2,000 signatures.

Norris previously said in a statement that he continued to represent his constituents, stayed across local and national developments, handled casework, policy queries and parliamentary questions.

He would only lose his position as an MP if he was charged, convicted and jailed.

Norris' term as the West of England mayor came to an end in May 2025, when he was replaced by Helen Godwin.

In a statement, Godwin said she was unable to comment on the ongoing police investigation.

"My thoughts are with everyone affected by today's deeply upsetting further news," she added.

Avon and Somerset Police said its investigation began in December 2024.

"Investigations into sexual offences are sensitive and complex and as a result it can take a significant amount of time for enquiries to be completed," a spokesperson for the force said.

"We're keeping victims updated on any developments and we'll continue to give access to any support they may need.

"We'd respectfully ask people not to speculate on the circumstances so our enquiries can continue unhindered."

Let's dive into the details: A close friend has paid tribute to a mother and daughter who were swept away at a seaside resort.

Sarah Keeling, 45, "adored" her daughter Grace, 15, who was her "whole world", Joanne Gee said. 

The bodies of Sarah and Mark Ratcliffe – a passer-by who tried to help – were recovered on Friday, shortly after they entered heavy seas in Withernsea, East Yorkshire. Police said they were still searching for Grace.

Fighting back tears as she placed flowers at the scene on Monday, Joanne said Sarah – who was a bridesmaid at her wedding – "left a mark with absolutely everyone she met".

Joanne, who travelled from her home in Derby to pay her respects, said she had known Sarah, from Nottinghamshire, for 15 years, with the pair sharing a passion for running.

She said: "Sarah was just always positive. I called her my 'yes girl' because if you ever wanted to do anything random she would be like 'yeah'.

"She was always doing things with family and friends. She definitely lived life to the full and took every opportunity to be happy."

Joanne, who had planned a weekend trip to London with Sarah in February, said she "could not comprehend" what the family was going through.

"Sarah adored Grace. Grace was her whole world."

Police said Mark, 67, died after trying to help Joanne and Grace.

"The poor man who gave his life to try and save them," said Joanne. "It's three beautiful souls lost.

"My life is gloomier having lost such a shining, bright person."

Joanne said she reacted with disbelief to the news that Sarah had died and Grace was missing.  

She added: "When it's someone you know and love... you just can't put it into words."      

On Sunday, Mark's family described him as a "true hero and role model".

They said he was a "loving husband, father, son, brother and the best grandad anybody could ever wish for".

Police said both families were being supported by specially trained officers.

Emergency services said they were first alerted at 15:10 GMT on Friday to reports of a number of people in difficulty in the water.

A huge search and rescue operation followed involving about 100 emergency workers, a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington, Skegness and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.

The coastguard stood down their search for Grace at 16:00 on Saturday, although police said earlier they were continuing efforts to find her, with underwater search teams involved.

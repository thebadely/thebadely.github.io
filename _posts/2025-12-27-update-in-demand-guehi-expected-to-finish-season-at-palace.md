Let's dive into the details: Marc Guehi has been capped for England 26 times since his debut in 2022

Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi is expected to see out the final six months of his contract at the club amid major interest in the centre-back before the January transfer window.

England international Guehi is in line for a free-transfer exit from Selhurst Park in the summer.

Interested parties may be tempted into bringing forward their plans to sign Guehi when the winter window opens on 1 January.

But as things stand, Guehi is likely to see out the season with Palace and sign for his next club on a free transfer.

Guehi can sign a pre-contract with an overseas club at the turn of 2026 with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan among the foreign sides to have shown an interest.

In England, Liverpool and Manchester City are both interested in the 25-year-old.

Guehi came close to moving to Anfield in the summer window after the clubs agreed a Â£35m fee.

But the deal collapsed on deadline day after Palace failed to sign a replacement.

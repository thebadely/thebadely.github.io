Let's dive into the details: The Princess of Wales has encouraged people to "cherish the bonds of love and friendship" this summer, as part of her Mother Nature video series.

In an Instagram post, Catherine narrates over clips showing natural landscapes and people enjoying the sunshine at the beach and in parks. 

It is the second such post from the princess this year - she launched the series in May with a special message for Mother's Day. 

Catherine has been making a gradual return to public duties since completing chemotherapy treatment last summer. 

Most recently she attended both Wimbledon tennis finals, as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, and Colchester Hospital's Wellbeing Garden - both in July.

Alongside the video, which was posted to the princess' official Instagram account on Wednesday, she wrote: "It has never been more important to appreciate the value of one another, and of Mother Nature. Here's to Summer."

The scenery featured was shot at locations in Sheffield, Bradford, North Wales and Anglesey and the south coast.

As part of her narration, Catherine describes summer as the "season for abundance", saying that "as the flowers bloom and the fruits ripen, we too are reminded of our own potential for growth".

A group of dancers from The Royal Ballet School, who performed in a Westminster Abbey carol service hosted by the princess last year, are also featured.

The video concludes with Catherine encouraging us to "embrace the joy to be found in even the most fleeting of moments and shared experiences".

Unlike the first video in the series, published earlier this year, the Prince of Wales does not feature.

In that one, there were shots of the pair walking their dogs in Norfolk. Catherine also alluded to her cancer diagnosis, saying nature had been her family's "sanctuary" for the past year.

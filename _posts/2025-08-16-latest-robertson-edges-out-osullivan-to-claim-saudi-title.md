It has been recently reported that Neil Robertson was playing in his 39th ranking final

Neil Robertson beat Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-9 in a classic encounter to claim the Saudi Arabia Masters title in Jeddah.  

The Australian takes home Â£500,000 for the 26th ranking title of his career and climbs to third in the world rankings. 

It represents another huge step forward in Robertson's return towards the top of the game. 

The 2010 world champion started last season outside the top 16 with his career seemingly spiralling, before he enjoyed success at the English Open and World Grand Prix. 

"Can't explain what this means in words," said Robertson. 

"I am really glad I could be part of something special. Coming into this tournament last year I was 28th in the world looking at provisionally being 40-something. Hopefully my story can inspire younger generations to never give up.

"You get ups and downs in sport and it is not about how far you fall, it is about how far you bounce. I think this probably surpasses the World Championship because I have had to answer a lot of questions. 

"To beat Ronnie here with so much on the line is definitely my best ever."

O'Sullivan's consolation is a runners-up cheque of Â£200,000 plus Â£180,333, which amounts to a two-thirds share of a Â£50,000 147 bonus and Â£147,000 for compiling two maximum breaks across snooker's big four tournaments.

However, it was a tale of what might have been for seven-time Crucible winner O'Sullivan, and relief for Robertson who appeared in complete control after establishing a 6-2 lead in the opening session. 

A break of 97 in the first frame in the evening extended Robertson's advantage but from there O'Sullivan, who was chasing a record-extending 42nd ranking title and his first for 19 months, looked irresistible. 

O'Sullivan rattled in the 1,300th century of his career with a 139 and made breaks of 97 and 89 in 36 minutes to get back to 7-5.

And with the momentum firmly with the Englishman he enjoyed runs of 57 and 80 to level the match at 7-7.

"The way he came back - being in this arena was probably the last place I wanted to be," added Robertson. 

"It was unbelievable from 7-2 to 7-7 - I barely did anything wrong." 

Robertson took the next with a 75 but when O'Sullivan won the 16th and 17th frames he appeared on course for a record pay day in a single event. 

But a break of 101 from Robertson ensured a 19th frame for the second year running, and he rounded off a famous triumph with a 101 break.

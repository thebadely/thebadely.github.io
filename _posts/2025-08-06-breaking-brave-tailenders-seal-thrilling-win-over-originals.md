Scorecard. Table

A late flurry of runs from Southern Brave's tailenders took them to a thrilling one-wicket win against Manchester Originals in The Hundred.

Chasing 132, Brave were struggling, needing 26 from the last 11 balls, with eight wickets down.

However, a Tymal Mills six followed by three consecutive Craig Overton boundaries dragged Brave back into contention, before Mills was caught off Lewis Gregory with three needed from three deliveries.

Reece Topley was the last man out of the dugout and the fast bowler cut his first ball for four to take his side to victory with one ball to spare.

Mills had starred in the Originals innings, taking 3-22 and removing three key top-order batters, including opener Phil Salt, who top-scored with 60.

The home side struggled after the powerplay, scoring just 82 runs off their last 74 deliveries to finish on 131-4.

Originals looked to be doing a good job of defending their low total, with seamer Scott Currie taking 4-28 as six Brave batters fell for single figures.

But Overton and his fellow seamers slugged the winning runs to see the 2024 runners-up home.

After the dismissal of opener Matty Hurst, England pair Salt and Jos Buttler got Originals off to a decent start, taking their side to 49-1 after 26 deliveries.

But Originals breached the ropes on just four occasions from that point, as the Brave bowlers successfully throttled their opponents.

Mills was parsimonious while also accounting for Originals' three most dangerous batters.

He had Buttler caught at deep cover from his second ball, and induced a leading edge from the big-hitting Heinrich Klaasen for a caught behind.

Having reached 60 from 39, Originals captain Salt would have felt he was in a position to push on with 20 balls remaining.

He hit the next Mills delivery for four, but the Brave veteran struck again next up, sending down a bouncer Salt pulled to short fine leg.

Originals handed Hundred debuts to 43-year-old James Anderson and 17-year-old rising star Farhan Ahmed, but both went wicketless, with 24-year-old Currie the key bowler.

Anderson took the ball from the start of the Brave innings, but ex-England batter Jason Roy had his measure, hitting five boundaries off the veteran's bowling, as Anderson finished with figures of 0-36.

Currie dismissed Leus du Plooy to end a promising 32-run second-wicket partnership, before removing Laurie Evans and later Chris Jordan and Michael Bracewell in the space of three balls.

His efforts seemed to have put his side on course to win, but the Brave tailed wagged to pull off a remarkable victory.

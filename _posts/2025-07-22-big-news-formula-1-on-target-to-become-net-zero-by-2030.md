Experts revealed that F1 said its sustainability progress had been achieved during a period of significant growth for the sport

Formula 1 says it is on target to become net zero in the next five years - effectively having zero carbon emissions by 2030.

The sport has delivered a 26% reduction since 2018, from the equivalent of 228,793 tonnes of CO2 a year to 168,720, according to its annual sustainability report. 

F1's president Stefano Domenicali said the five-year net zero target was a "concrete goal" and "already visible in the significant reduction of our sport's carbon footprint". 

"We are proud of what we have achieved so far and remain determined to continue on this path," he said. 

'We have taken big actions without being shy'

F1 launched its sustainability strategy in 2019 with a long-term commitment to reduce carbon emissions in areas like travel, logistics, and energy use. 

Changing the now 24-race calendar, so grands prix are grouped together by region to reduce travel, has also helped F1 in its quest for greater sustainability, with Japan moving to an April slot and Azerbaijan twinning with Singapore in the autumn since the 2024 season.

Team factories are now using more green energy such as wind and solar power, resulting in a 59% reduction in emissions from these facilities compared to seven years ago.

Other initiatives that have contributed include F1 expanding the use of biofuel trucks for transporting freight in Europe, which reduced related carbon emissions by an average of 83%.

From the 2026 season and beyond, F1 is introducing new regulations that will feature environmentally friendly cars with engines that have a near 50-50 split between electric and internal combustion power - and use fully sustainable fuels.

To further improve the flow of the calendar, Canada switches to an earlier date in May, followed by a run of nine European races, starting with Monaco in June and ending with the new Madrid Grand Prix in September.  

"Formula 1 has always been synonymous with innovation and the desire to improve," added Domenicali.

"Once again, this mentality has allowed us to make important progress, not only for those who work in this world, but also for society as a whole.

"While continuing to grow globally, we have shown that sustainable development is possible and that the strategies we have adopted are yielding tangible results." 

The report said any remaining unavoidable emissions in 2030 "will be offset using credible programmes in line with latest best practice guidance".

Carbon offset programs typically help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by supporting projects which reduce environmental harm, such as tree planting schemes.

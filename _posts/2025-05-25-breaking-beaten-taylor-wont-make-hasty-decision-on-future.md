Taylor 'gutted' after Essuman defeat

Josh Taylor says he will take some time to consider if he wants to continue boxing after his shock defeat by Ekow Essuman.

After a strong start in Glasgow, the former undisputed world champion faded in the second half of the fight and all three judges awarded Essuman victory on the scorecards.

It was a bitterly disappointing first outing at welterweight for the 34-year-old, with many feeling it's now time for him to call time on his career.

"I'm going to take a little bit of time just to think about what's coming," Taylor told BBC Scotland in an interview the morning after the fight. 

"I'll just relax for a couple of weeks and not make any hasty decisions. If I really feel that I'm not performing, then I will hang them up.

"I'm very disappointed in the result. Three back-to-back defeats in a row. I took it quite tough."

What now for Taylor after another defeat?

Taylor made a sharp exit from the ring after the judges' decision was announced at the Hydro, neglecting to do post-fight interviews.

"I just want to congratulate Ekow on a good performance and doing a good job and getting the win," said Taylor. "I congratulated him in the ring. 

"I was just totally gutted, hence the reason why I jumped out of the ring. My emotions were all over the place. I didn't want to do an interview and end up saying something that I end up regretting.

"I really should have taken the time and opportunity to thank everybody for coming and continuing their support. 

"The people in the arena lifted the roof off the place. The atmosphere was unbelievable again."

Taylor says he is devastated by the defeat, and believes inactivity - he has not fought more than once in a calendar year since 2019 - has contributed to his recent struggles.

"If I'm going to keep going, I need to get more active and get out at least a couple of times a year," he said.

"I'm just gutted because I know I am better than that and I know when I'm at my best I can beat anyone. I'm just gutted."

Taylor's face at the end â bloodied and bruised â told its own story, one of a fighter who has been taking too many shots for too long.

The question over whether he should retire has been hanging in the air for some time and this defeat strengthens the case for the Tartan Tornado to hang up the gloves.

Very few boxers get to bow out on their own terms and time their exit to perfection. For every Joe Calzaghe and Lennox Lewis, there are hundreds more who held on for too long, chasing that final moment of glory.

If and when Taylor calls it a day â and most will feel that time is now â he should be celebrated for an extraordinary career most fighters could only dream of.

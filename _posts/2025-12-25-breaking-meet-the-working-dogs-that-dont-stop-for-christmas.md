According to new developments, By now, many of us are off work for Christmas Day and enjoying switching off with family and friends.

Not so, for many of Northern Ireland's dogs with jobs - the four-legged professionals who keep working just as they do at any other given time of the year.

But even while working, their families are making sure they still have some festive fun and treats - as well as a lot of love.

BBC News NI meets some of the working dogs who will remain on duty over  Christmas.

Christmas is often a time of excitement, of more noise and bright lights, a time of festive hustle and bustle.

For Lucia Kane, 17, from Crumlin in County Antrim, that can make it a more challenging time. She is autistic and has Tourette syndrome. 

Her support comes from Jojo, a seven-year-old black Labrador - one of Assistance Dogs NI support dogs.

Jojo senses when stress levels rise. She responds by lying close or across Lucia to help calm her. 

Jojo's presence offers reassurance when things become too much.

"I really do love her, she's one of my best friends," Lucia told BBC News NI.

Lucia's mum, Elizabeth Kane, said Jojo transformed her daughter's life when the Labrador became part of the family five years ago.

"She gives Lucia confidence and helps her talk to people," she said.

"Her presence de-stresses any situation one million percent."

"Christmas can be a lot more challenging," Elizabeth added. 

"If we go out, there are more people, and [if] there is more people and more noise, Jojo will not leave Lucia's side."

This Christmas, Elizabeth said, feels especially precious for the family.

Jojo recently survived a serious illness after swallowing a stone. That left Jojo very poorly and Lucia distraught. 

"Lucia didn't sleep, didn't leave the house," Elizabeth said.

Now fully recovered, Jojo will be spoiled a little more this Christmas, she added.

"Lucia will wrap her presents and Jojo will open them herself," she said.

"There will be extra gifts this year – and definitely turkey and ham on Christmas Day."

In Londonderry, a busy Christmas may lie ahead for Igi and Kodi.

Like many emergency service personnel, this police dog (PD) pair have work to do over the holidays.

"Unfortunately both Kodi and Igi will be on duty this Christmas Day," Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Insp Neil Harrison said.

A few rest days will come after, he said, adding that then they can enjoy their presents and get some rest.

PD Igi, a German Shepherd Dog, is a general police patrol dog. He could, Insp Harrison said, be called on to attend a variety of incidents over this festive season.

"There is a lot more socialising and we see nightlife increase  - and it is great to see - but, unfortunately, it does come with an increase in some anti-social behaviour, falling out amongst people and drink/drug driving," Insp Harrison said.

However often, "a few choice barks" or "a stern look from the big fella" is all it takes to de-escalate the situation, the senior officer added.

Insp Harrison said Christmas is a difficult time for some people and they can find themselves in crisis.

PD Igi can also be called on to help in the search if someone goes missing.

"Igi's nose and tracking abilities can be invaluable to the policing efforts," he said.

"Those who need a little help are often glad to be found by a police dog."

Cocker spaniel Kodi is one of the PSNI's newest search dogs. 

"She enjoys nothing more than her favourite game of finding hidden items," Insp Harrison said.

In terms of Kodi's policing work that could mean drugs or weapons. 

"Kodi is busy all year round helping the PSNI with our efforts to remove these items from criminals and locate drugs before they get into the communities," he added.

When the Christmas shift is done, Insp Harrison said, "relaxing and getting some rest" will be the priority for both dogs and handlers.

He added: "All our dogs will be spend some time at home, at some point over the festive period where they enjoy Christmas just like everyone else."

Sheepdog Bowie, a collie and Australian Kelpie mix, has been farmer Thomas Conway's right-hand dog on his cattle and sheep farm in Park, County Londonderry, for the last four years.

"You couldn't run a farm without a good sheepdog," Thomas said.

"That goes for all year round, a good sheepdog is worth 10 people on the farm," he told BBC News NI.

Spring lambing season is Bowie's busiest time, but there's still work to be done on the farm at Christmas.

"At wintertime you are moving sheep and changing sheep. He is out most days all day, every day, he'll be out on Christmas Day," Thomas said.

Bowie's never short of canine company, sharing farm life with Thomas's other dogs, springer spaniels Bob, Lala, George and Flo.

"We'll be out three or four times, on Christmas Day," Thomas said. 

"I will do my rounds in the morning, we'll check the livestock, check the sheep that are out. Bowie and George will come with me," he added.

The springer spaniels, Thomas added, will work at a shoot on Boxing Day.

Bowie, named because like musical icon David Bowie he has different coloured eyes, will enjoy a more relaxed day. 

All five dogs, Thomas added, can also look forward to a Christmas treat or two.

"They'll get two feeds on Christmas Day, there will be turkey and ham, and the stuffing and some of the bones, they'll be mad about that."

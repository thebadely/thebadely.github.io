Ferguson takes lead in Tour of Britain

Teenager Cat Ferguson secured victory on stage three to take the overall leader's green jersey at the Tour of Britain Women.

The 19-year-old Briton, riding for Movistar, launched her attack with 150m remaining and held off compatriot Josie Nelson and New Zealand's Ally Wollaston to the line in Kelso.

Ferguson moved into the overall lead because of the time bonus attributed to winning the stage, with FDJ-Suez's Wollaston three seconds behind.

Denmark's Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig, of Canyon Sram-Zondacrypto, launched the initial attack on the final climb with 25km to go, with Ferguson and Team Picnic-PostNL's Nelson for company.

Karlijn Swinkels and Eleonora Gasparrini of UAE Team ADQ and Wollaston bridged the gap before Ludwig fell away with a mechanical problem to leave a runaway group of five.

Ferguson then made her move in the closing stages to claim a first World Tour stage victory.

"I'm over the moon. This was one of the races I was most excited to do this season, and I really wanted to come here in good form and show Britain how good I can be. I think I proved that today," she said.

"It's really emotional. It's so lovely to have my family here, and it really is a team win, the team really supported me, and I feel so lucky to have them.

"We worked well together and I knew that if I positioned myself well into that final corner, I could probably win the sprint."

The fourth and final stage takes place in Glasgow on Sunday.

Experts revealed that Tadej Pogacar (centre) is aiming to win his fourth Tour de France 

The 112th edition of the Tour de France is under way, with the three-week race ending on the Champs-Elysees in Paris on Sunday, 27 July. 

The riders tackle six mountain stages, including trips to the Pyrenees and Alps, during the gruelling 3,320km (2,063-mile) race.

There are also two individual time trials, with the second featuring the steep climb up to the Altiport in Peyragudes.

BBC Sport looks at all 21 stages of La Grande Boucle, analysing where it could be won and lost.

This page will be updated throughout the Tour with the winner and a brief report following each stage.

Jasper Philipsen became the first sprinter to claim the yellow jersey on the opening day since 2020

Winner: Jasper Philipsen

Report: Philipsen wins stage one to claim first yellow jersey

Jasper Philipsen was the first rider to wear the yellow jersey this year - claiming the maillot jaune for the first time in his career.

A sprint finish was expected after a flat stage beginning and ending in Lille, and Alpecin-Deceuninck's lead-out train delivered the 27-year-old in the perfect position to claim his 10th stage win.

Crosswinds contributed to a chaotic opening day, which saw the peloton split about 17km from the finish, with most of Philipsen's team-mates in the lead group.

Mathieu van der Poel won his second ever stage at the Tour de France

Winner: Mathieu van der Poel

Report: Van der Poel pips Pogacar in stage two sprint finish

Mathieu van der Poel edges out Tadej Pogacar in a sprint finish to win stage two of the Tour de France and claim the leader's yellow jersey.

The Dutch rider, who also won the same stage in 2021, holds off the three-time Tour champion on the line after surging to the front with 500 metres to go on the longest stage in this year's race, a rolling 209.1km route from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer.

Tim Merlier won his only previous stage at the Tour in 2021

Winner: Tim Merlier

Report: Merlier pips Milan in crash-marred stage three of Tour

Tim Merlier pips Jonathan Milan on the line in a sprint finish to win a crash-marred stage three of the Tour de France.

The Belgian edges the Italian by the slenderest of margins with Germany's Phil Bauhaus in third on a day when Mathieu van der Poel retains the race leader's yellow jersey and stage one winner Jasper Philipsen is forced to abandon.

Tadej Pogacar is aiming for his fourth triumph at the Tour de France

Winner: Tadej Pogacar

Report: Pogacar claims 100th victory on stage four of Tour

Defending champion Tadej Pogacar outsprints Mathieu van der Poel and Jonas Vingegaard as he claims his 100th professional victory on stage four. The result leaves the Slovenian level on time with Dutch rider at the top of the general classification with Van der Poel retaining the leader's yellow jersey on count-back.

Remco Evenepoel is the world and Olympic time-trial champion

Winner: Remco Evenepoel

Report: Evenepoel wins stage five as Pogacar claims yellow jersey

Remco Evenepoel wins the individual time trial on stage five of the Tour de France as Tadej Pogacar takes the yellow jersey from Mathieu van der Poel.

The Belgian rider averages 54kmh to finish 16 seconds quicker than Slovenia's three-time champion Pogacar, with Italy's Edoardo Affini, third, 33 seconds back.

Meanwhile, Denmark's two-time winner Jonas Vingegaard has a day to forget, losing more than a minute to Pogacar in the general classification.

Ben Healy's only previous Grand Tour stage win came at the Giro d'Italia in 2023

Winner: Ben Healy

Report: Healy claims first Tour win as Van der Poel regains lead

Ireland's Ben Healy produces a stunning solo attack to win his first Tour stage while Mathieu van der Poel regains the yellow jersey.

Healy and Van der Poel spend most of the hilly stage in an eight-man breakaway before the EF Education-EasyPost rider goes clear with 42km remaining.

Van der Poel does enough to regain the race lead by one second from Tadej Pogacar, who eased in at the front of the peloton with his main general classification rivals.

Pogacar beat rival Jonas Vingegaard to the line 

Winner: Tadej Pogacar

Report: Pogacar wins stage seven to regain race lead

Reigning champion Tadej Pogacar regains the race lead from Mathieu van der Poel, who is still suffering after a gruelling day on Thursday.

Stage seven has the same finish as it did in 2021, when Van der Poel claimed his first stage win on the iconic Mur-de-Bretagne climb.

But the Dutch rider is unable to challenge Pogacar here as the three-time winner edges out Jonas Vingegaard in a sprint for the line, with British rider Oscar Onley completing the podium.

Milan won on his Tour de France debut

Winner: Jonathan Milan

Italy's Milan wins stage eight following a bunch sprint.

Lidl Trek's Milan beat Wout van Aert of Visma-Lease a Bike on the flat 171.4km stage into Laval's Espace Mayenne.

Milan, 24, waited patiently in the wheels of Mathieu van der Poel and Kaden Groves, both of Alpecin-Deceuninck, in the final 200 metres before using his immense power to launch himself towards the line - with only Van Aert able to cling on behind.

Australian Groves finishes third.

Tim Merlier collected his second win and Soudal Quick-Step's third in this edition of the Tour

Winner: Tim Merlier

Report: Merlier wins sprint finish as Van der Poel denied epic breakaway triumph

Tim Merlier wins stage nine of the Tour de France in a sprint finish after Mathieu van der Poel's hopes of an audacious breakaway victory are dashed inside the final kilometre.

Van der Poel and his Alpecin-Deceuninck team-mate Jonas Rickaert attacked at the start of the 174.1km run from Chinon to Chateauroux and the Dutch former world champion produced a gutsy effort that just fell short of delivering his second win in this year's race.

An emotional Ben Healy faced an anxious wait to find out if he had done enough to take the race lead

Winner: Simon Yates

Report: Yates wins stage 10 on Bastille Day as Ireland's Healy takes yellow

Britain's Simon Yates takes stage 10 of the Tour de France on Bastille Day as Ben Healy becomes the first Irish rider to claim the yellow jersey since Stephen Roche won the race in 1987.

Yates, who claimed his second Grand Tour triumph at the Giro d'Italia in June, is part of a long-range breakaway and times his attack superbly on the final ascent of the 165.3km stage to hold off Thymen Arensman.

Jonas Abrahamsen outsprinted Mauro Schmid, with Mathieu van der Poel crossing seven seconds later

Winner: Jonas Abrahamsen

Report: Pogacar crashes but no time loss as Abrahamsen wins

Jonas Abrahamsen holds on for his first stage win on the Tour after being part of a long-range breakaway.

Back in the peloton, Tadej Pogacar went down 4km from the line but was allowed to recover as his main general classification rivals Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel sportingly waited for him to catch up.

Pogacar, therefore, remained 29 seconds behind Ben Healy as there was no change in the top 10 of the overall standings.

Tadej Pogacar dedicated his third stage win of the Tour to Samuele Privitera, a 19-year-old rider who died after a crash at the Giro della Valle d'Aosta the previous day

Winner: Tadej Pogacar

Report: Pogacar wins on summit finish to regain Tour lead

Tadej Pogacar regained the overall lead as he stormed to victory on the first summit finish and first true mountain stage of this year's Tour.

The Slovenian showed no ill effects from his fall the previous day as he attacked early on the Hautacam - this year's first hors categorie climb - and continued to stretch his lead, more than doubling his advantage over main rival Jonas Vingegaard.

As the race moved into the Pyrenees mountains, breakaway specialist Ben Healy struggled in the heat on the final climbs and lost more than 13 minutes, as well as the yellow jersey.

Tadej Pogacar became the youngest rider to reach 21 Tour stage wins

Winner: Tadej Pogacar

Report: Imperious Pogacar wins time trial to extend lead

Tadej Pogacar wins the mountain time trail to claim his fourth stage victory of the Tour.

He completes the route 36 seconds faster than his main rival Jonas Vingegaard to increase his overall lead to four minutes seven seconds.

Despite losing another two minutes, Remco Evenepoel stays third in the general classification while British youngster Oscar Onley leapfrogs Kevin Vauquelin to fifth.

Thymen Arensman had one previous Grand Tour win, at the 2022 Vuelta a Espana

Winner: Thymen Arensman

Report: Evenepoel abandons race as Arensman wins stage 14

Dutch debutant Thymen Arensman secures not only his maiden stage win but the first on this year's Tour for British team Ineos Grenadiers.

The 25-year-old attacks on the penultimate climb and reaches the summit finish just over a minute before Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard, with Pogacar marginally increasing his overall lead.

However, Remco Evenepoel, who was third overall, struggles early on the day's first climb - up the mighty Col du Tourmalet - and is forced to abandon this year's race.

Tim Wellens completed a Grand Tour treble having also won stages at the Giro d'Italia (two) and Vuelta a Espana (two)

Winner: Tim Wellens

Report: Wellens cruises to maiden Tour win on stage 15

Freed from his domestique duties for UAE Emirates-XRG team-mate Tadej Pogacar, Tim Wellens wins his first Tour stage at 34 years old.

The Belgian road champion attacks on the final climb and goes clear on the long descent to Carcassone, 44km from the finish.

He claims a breakaway win by one minute 28 seconds while Pogacar finishes with the peloton six minutes after Wellens to maintain his lead over Jonas Vingegaard in general classification.

Chris Froome is the only British rider to have won a stage on Mont Ventoux in the Tour de France

Stage 16 is a flat route until one of the most legendary mountains in Tour history comes into view at the end with the potential to turn the race on its head.

With no categorised climbs all day before Mont Ventoux, and the intermediate sprint featuring 112km into the stage, it would be no surprise if the peloton remains largely intact until then.

In 2016, strong winds meant the finish was moved to Chalet Reynard halfway up the climb as Thomas de Gendt won from the breakaway and drama unfolded on the slopes behind with the yellow jersey, Chris Froome, initially running up the mountain after a crash.

The Tour is stopping in Valence for the fourth time in 10 years

With two big Alpine tests still to come the GC teams will probably play second fiddle to the sprint teams when it comes to trying to rein in any breakaways.

The last three winners of a Tour stage in Valence were Mark Cavendish (2021), Peter Sagan (2018), and Andre Greipel (2015) and the only thing likely to prevent a bunch sprint is the mistral winds that can be fierce in the Rhone Valley.

In 2023 Austria's Felix Gall won the stage into Courchevel

This year's queen stage comes with more than 5,500m of elevation across 171.5km of racing and three legendary climbs which makes it arguably the toughest run of the entire Tour. 

All three ascents fall under the hors categorie, with the Col du Glandon, a 21.7km drag with with sections at double digits just for starters.

The Col de la Madeleine, is shorter but steeper and the while there is a rapid descent and the rises in the road come sharply again on the monstrous Col de la Loze, a climb of over 26km with gradients hitting 11% as the Tour reaches it's highest point.

Albertville was the host city of the 1992 Winter Olympics

The last real mountain stage represents the final opportunity for those high in the GC standings to make a play for the yellow jersey. 

The route from Albertville to La Plagne covers almost 130km, and includes five leg-sapping ascents.

Plenty of points will be up for grabs again in the race for the the polka-dot jersey points available but this is really a last-chance saloon in terms of the overall race.

Whoever is leading at end of the day will be confident, that barring an unforseen disaster, they will be stood atop the podium, draped in yellow on the Champs-Elysees.

This is Pontarlier's first Tour appearance since 2009, when Alberto Contador won the stage to Verbier

The penultimate stage sees the race snake over the hills of the Jura towards Pontarlier.

The rolling terrain should favour an escapee triumphing, while the GC teams protect their leaders.

The Tour will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of its first finish on the Champs-Elysees

The Tour returns to it's traditional Paris finish after relocating to Nice last year due to the Olympics.

However, it does so with a twist, given the cobbled climb up to the Sacre-CÅur Basilica features three times in a throwback to the road race in the 2024 Paris Games.

It's a 1,1km ascent at a gradient of 5.9% added to the original finishing circuit in the French capital designed to whittle down the field before a high-speed finish albeit possibly without some of the pure sprinters.

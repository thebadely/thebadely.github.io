A day to remember for Jofra Archer and Joe Root on day two of third Test

Third Rothesay Test, Lord's (day two of five)

England 387: Root 104, Carse 56, Smith 51; Bumrah 5-74

India 145-3: Rahul 53*, Nair 40

India are 242 runs behind

Scorecard

Jofra Archer took a wicket with the third delivery of his comeback on a memorable and fluctuating second day of the third Test between England and India.

After more than four years away with career-threatening injuries, Archer electrified Lord's by having Yashasvi Jasiwal caught at second slip, wheeling away to celebrate with overflowing emotion.

Somehow, India suffered only one loss in Archer's opening burst, but England plugged away in the extreme heat for two more crucial breakthroughs.

Joe Root's magnificent catch at first slip not only ended Karun Nair's resistance at 40, but also gave Root his 211th grab in Tests, a record for an outfielder. The bowler was captain Ben Stokes, fit after a first-day injury scare.

Of more significance was the removal of prolific India captain Shuman Gill, caught behind off Chris Woakes for 16.

KL Rahul remains on 53, Rishabh Pant is fit to bat after a finger injury and has 19. India closed on 145-3, 242 behind England's 387 all out.

For all of the excitement around Archer, his was not the most influential spell of fast bowling of the day: Jasprit Bumrah tore through England with 5-74.

Bumrah bowled Stokes for 44, had Root play on after he completed his 37th Test century and took an edge to condemn Woakes to a golden duck, all in a seven-ball period.

England slipped to 271-7, but India crucially dropped Jamie Smith on five. The wicketkeeper was fluent for 51, adding 84 with Brydon Carse, who was impressive for his maiden Test half-century.

The first day of this Test was a grind, England battling their way to 251-4. The second day, as Lord's turned red for the Ruth Strauss Foundation, was action-packed.

Whatever happens in Archer's career from now on, the wicket of Jaiswal, his celebration and the reaction of the crowd will go down in English cricket folklore. An 'I was there' moment.

Even for the brilliance of Archer, who looked like he had never been away, England were struggling to make inroads under a burning sun and on an unresponsive pitch until the vital wicket of Gill.

That, along with the likely deterioration of the surface perhaps tips the balance towards the hosts. History is on their side: only once on this ground has a team made more than 387 batting first and lost, and that was a 1930 England team to an Australia side containing Sir Donald Bradman.

India might have been in a stronger position had they held Smith and not pushed to change the ball that gave Bumrah his first three wickets of the day.

The replacement did nothing and the tourists got it changed again eight overs later. The morning was, at times, a frustrating spectacle, with 15 overs fewer than scheduled bowled throughout the day.

That was forgotten as the shadows lengthened in an arm-wrestle of an evening. These two sides are evenly matched, this Test and the series are beautifully poised.

Picking up where he left off - watch Archer's first over back for England

Archer's best moments in an England shirt came at Lord's in his debut summer of 2019. How fitting that he would return to Test cricket on this ground after being tormented by back and elbow injuries.

His impact was almost instant, first going past the outside edge of Jaiswal to enliven the crowd. Two balls later, Archer found movement down the slope away from the left-hander, Jaiswal edged to Harry Brook and Lord's erupted.

Overall, Archer's average speed of 89.5mph is the third-fastest recorded opening burst by an England bowler since speeds began being logged in 2006. It is to the credit of Rahul and Nair they battled through.

India dug in, England had to get creative. At one point, Stokes posted three catchers in front of the bat on the leg side. The captain bowled with good pace of his own to take the edge of Nair and Root took a sensational one-handed grab to break the fielding record of India great Rahul Dravid.

Rahul looked immovable, but it was the wicket of Gill England craved and Woakes obliged. Smith, standing up to the stumps to keep the India captain in his crease, was sharp enough to hold an edge.

Given the conditions, England are likely to need plenty from Shoaib Bashir in the coming days. The off-spinner is so far coming off second-best in his duel with the flamboyant Pant.

With all that happened on Friday, it was hard to recall Root scored the one run he needed to complete a superb century from the first ball of the day, delivered by Bumrah. After Root celebrated, Bumrah took charge.

Stokes was cleaned up through the gate by one Bumrah moved down the slope. In Bumrah's next over, Root's drive was deflected back on to his stumps and Woakes played a loose waft at his first ball.

In between, Smith was put down by Rahul at second slip off Mohammed Siraj. India, possibly distracted by the ball shenanigans, lost their way. The tourists dropped the field, offering plenty of opportunities for Smith and Carse to score through the off side.

Smith timed the ball more easily than any of his team-mates. The 407 runs he has so far is already the third-most by an England wicketkeeper in a single series, with a possible five more innings to score the 59 more required to overhaul Alec Stewart's 465.

He was caught behind off Siraj just after lunch, opening the door for Bumrah to bowl Archer and put his name on the Lord's honours board for the first time.

Carse's swiping off Siraj was entertaining, his half-century reached with a straight six, before Siraj had his revenge with a middle-stump yorker.

England batter Joe Root, speaking to Test Match Special: "I did wake up at about half one in the morning and went through every dismissal I could possibly get out to.

"Then, I thought it's not about me, it's about us getting a decent score, stop being so selfish and get over yourself. Once I did that I went back to sleep, so much better."

India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, speaking to TMS: "It's quite evenly balanced but slightly ahead in our favour.

"Being on the honours board feels good. I was excited to play at Lord's."

Former England captain Sir Alastair Cook on TMS: "It's a good day for England - they are just above par on a sluggish pitch.

"But if India are still batting at the end of the day tomorrow then they'll have their noses ahead."

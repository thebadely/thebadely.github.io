Standout performance from Vicario saves draw from Spurs at Monaco

The ornate surroundings of Monaco's Stade Louis II provide an environment that is almost welcoming by Champions League standards and Tottenham Hotspur were grateful for a large helping of their hosts' generosity.

In this millionaires' playground famous for its casinos and the roll of the dice, Spurs were reliant on the brilliance of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario as well as a liberal sprinkling of good luck to escape with a point.

This goalless draw featured a dismal display by Thomas Frank's side, who will have to produce a marked improvement if they are to make a serious dent in the competition they reached by winning the Europa League last season.

The game did at least produce one remarkable statistic: this was Spurs' first 0-0 in 125 games, the last being a Champions League stalemate with AC Milan in March 2023.

Spurs never looked like breaking their half of the bargain, mustering a mere two shots on target.

They certainly did not produce a performance to please their supporters who made the trip to Monaco, populating one corner of a stadium that is more about architecture than atmosphere. Even the home team's self-styled "Ultras" are civilised when measured by the standards of others.

Gathering under the arches that characterise one end of the ground, the visiting fans delivered loud groans when Spurs slowed the game down as the clock ran down in stoppage time, then delivered boos when the final whistle sounded.

Like many who visit the gambling haunts of Monaco, they will have left feeling they had not got value for their money. They were unhappy to see Spurs seemingly settle for a draw after surviving so many scares.

Spurs escaped via a rearguard action, which at least left head coach Frank able to point at an unbeaten record after three games, this point following on from a scrambled draw away to Norwegian champions Bodo Glimt, where they recovered from 2-0 down.

And it was thanks to Italian keeper Vicario, whose performances have come under increasing scrutiny.

Thomas Frank's side remain unbeaten in this season's Champions League league phase

He was the Spurs hero, magnificent throughout, producing four first-half saves of note, three from former Arsenal forward Folarin Balogun then another when he clawed out an effort from Maghnes Akliouche.

Vicario thwarted both Balogun and Akliouche again after the interval, as well as substitute Aleksandr Golovin, but the best was a point-blank block from Jordan Teze when it seemed certain Monaco would get the goal they merited.

Tottenham boss Frank said of his goalkeeper: "I think he was very good today. I think some of the saves were exceptional. He's a big part of why we got a hard-fought point, but at the end of the day, it can be a crucial point."

Even then, Spurs were grateful for the woeful finishing of Monaco's former Liverpool midfielder Takumi Minamino, who wasted three presentable late chances, much to the growing frustration of the home fans, who increasingly feared they would be victims of a smash-and-grab as opportunities came and went.

Spurs currently lie 15th in the Champions League table and their next two games are at home to FC Copenhagen, then away to holders Paris St. Germain, who will not be as forgiving as Monaco if given the sort of licence they offered here.

Spurs celebrated entry into the Champions League as a signpost to serious progress but they are still acclimatising to the demands of Europe's elite tournament.

They were uncomfortable from the start, encouraging home fans to raise the noise levels inside a unique arena that is one of the least hostile places Spurs are likely to visit as the Champions League progresses.

It will certainly be different when they walk into the bearpit that will be the Parc des Princes on 26 November. They will not escape with a point if they repeat this unambitious, abject effort.

Vicario was not the only stand-out, with Micky van de Ven, captain in the absence of injured Cristian Romero, doing his best to ensure Monaco were kept at bay.

Former Spurs defender Eric Dier, who was denied the opportunity to face his old club because of injury, received a warm welcome from their fans as he walked around the pitch at half-time while Paul Pogba watched on from the stands as he waits to make his Monaco debut after signing in June.

He was allowed to resume his career in March following a Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling reducing a four-year doping ban to 18 months.

Spurs have not sparkled in the Champions League even though they have yet to lose - but this was not the sort of performance offering hope for the future in the tournament.

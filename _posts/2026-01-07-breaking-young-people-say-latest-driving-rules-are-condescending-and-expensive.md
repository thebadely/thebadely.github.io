Here’s what you need to know: In new measures to increase driver safety, the government has proposed learner drivers wait six months between taking their theory test and their practical test.

But Catherine, from Bristol, is waiting to take her driving test and says the proposed rule seems "condescending" towards younger drivers, adding further barriers at a time when many need to drive as soon as possible to find jobs and earn their independence.

The 26-year-old's view was reflected among the many young drivers who contacted us via BBC Your Voice about how the proposed changes could affect them, with one saying the proposals amounted to "age discrimination", and another saying they could push people to more dangerous forms of transport such as motorbikes or scooters.

The government believes a minimum period between sitting the theory test and the practical test would help learner drivers develop their skills, including driving in different conditions.

Currently, learner drivers can take lessons from 17 and book a practical test as soon as they have passed a theory exam.

But Catherine says introducing a mandatory waiting period would be pointless as the wait times for a driving test are already so long. 

"Additionally, the prices of driving lessons can be very high. I am struggling to afford it... and with the cost of living being so high and the jobs crisis among young people, many people will not be able to afford six extra months of lessons," she said.

She adds that while she understands younger people can be more irresponsible when driving, the rule would affect drivers of all ages but seems to be being drafted with "teenagers in mind."

She believes policies sometimes "infantilise young people" by not really considering them adults "except when it's convenient", with "every problem being pinned on those between the ages of, say, 15-20".

"People don't have responsibility unless you give it to them," she concludes.

"An 18-year-old can be a parent or a young carer - there are lots of reasons they need to start driving as soon as possible."

One person wrote to the BBC saying: "I am sick and tired of this. I'm 25, I'm not a child.

"I'm not wanting to go and race in my car or drink drive, I'd just like to have an easier life, I just want to be able to see my family more, to go shopping and put it in the boot of my car… putting restrictions on all new drivers is completely unfair."

On the flip side, 21-year-old Ryan from Reading thinks learner drivers should spend a minimum amount of time with a driving instructor "because the standard of driving - especially those who have just passed - is a bit shocking".

The proposals say informal learning with parents or guardians will count, but Ryan says: "All the parents are doing is teaching the kids what they did many years ago, and driving theory has been updated."

However, he understands lessons can be expensive, and that in some cases it's very necessary that people are allowed to drive as soon as they can. Ryan says that sometimes, the buses only go to his surrounding villages once every hour, increasing reliance on cars to get around.

And he says it can be even more expensive for young people who are trying to get by on their own wages, especially as many will be on the minimum wage.

"You'd need to work around three hours just to pay for one hour with your instructor," he says.

Other parts of the proposals intend to make it easier to get someone off the road if they've been caught driving while under the influence of drugs.

Those over 70 may also have to take eye tests to ensure their vision is still fit for the road.

But the proposals should go further and get all older people to take their test again, says 26-year-old Jennifer from Liverpool.

"I don't have a vendetta against older people - I know there are some 17- and 18-year-olds who show off to their mates and drink and drive - but older people get confused on the road," she says. "And some don't declare illnesses they have for fear of having their licence taken away."

She is currently taking lessons and says that many learner drivers are older, like her, and the proposed rules would unfairly target her rather than those irresponsible drivers at either end of the age scale.

The majority of driving tests in Britain are taken by under-25s. In 2024-25, about 55% of tests were taken by drivers aged 17-24.

Jack, from York, thinks the proposals are reasonable, noting there was an increased rate of accidents at "either end of the age scale". He is currently thinking about taking lessons.

"If they hadn't suggested eye test for older people, I would feel targeted, but I feel like it's fair," the 25-year-old says.

However he does feel that "forcing people to take them [lessons] for six months means forcing them to pay expensive driving fees for an extended period of time."

He adds: "Reforming a system is important but if it's extended, there has to be some sort of consideration of the expense of driving lessons."

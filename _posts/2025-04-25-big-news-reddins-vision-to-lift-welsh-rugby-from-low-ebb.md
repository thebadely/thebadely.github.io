Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dave Reddin was part of the British and Irish Lions backroom staff in New Zealand in 2005

Finally the worst kept secret in Welsh rugby has been confirmed, with Dave Reddin unveiled at Principality Stadium as Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) director of rugby.

Having worked with World Cup-winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward and England football manager Gareth Southgate, as well as helping guide Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, Reddin has been identified as the man to fix the problem that is Welsh rugby.

In his first public address, Reddin certainly looked and sounded the part, with a polished routine in his smart suit.

The message was that the only way is up as Reddin spoke about his responsibility to appoint a new men's head coach, how he is not afraid to have tough conversations and how he hopes to lift Welsh rugby from a low ebb.

Sitting next to his new boss, WRU chief executive Abi Tierney, Reddin started by outlining why he has taken a job he describes as "a real standout opportunity".

"Global rugby has probably been grieving for Wales and where they have been recently," he said.  

"That chance to be involved in a system at a low point, but [which] has the motivation for change, is something that inspired me.

"At the beginning of the process I was trying to assess whether it was the right opportunity or not. Talking to Abi and Richard [Collier-Keywood, WRU chairman], the vision they had it was compelling.

"It's about changing a system to create one that is authentically Welsh, that capitalises on the advantages Wales has as a small country, the proximity between regions and national team. 

"It's about turning that into a genuine advantage other nations find difficult to overcome."

Reddin revealed he had talked to key rugby figures about taking on the position.

Among those were Dan Biggar, Jamie Roberts and Woodward, who Reddin described as "an influential person in my career".

Reddin consulted others who he preferred not to name who "have been connected to the Welsh system in the past".

"I tried to do some careful thinking so I had my eyes wide open coming in," he said.  

"With any job, especially with an organisation or system that is at a low ebb, you want to understand whether things are fixable. 

"I wanted to spend enough time to understand that and the reason I am here is everybody was able to satisfy my questions in that area.

"The genuine sentiment from everybody was positive from the opportunity that was here and what persuaded me in the end it was right."

Dave Reddin was part of the England rugby national set-up between 1997 and 2006

Reddin insists he is not scared to ruffle some feathers.

"It's about developing good relationships with people," said Reddin. 

"What I will say is that I'm not scared to have the tough conversations.

"Whilst I want to come in, listen and learn, I don't want to come in and collude with the culture that's here. 

"I think it's about changing the culture and evolving things because we want to be in a different place in the future to where we are now."

Nevertheless, Reddin says he does not feel "everything is broken" in Welsh rugby.

"I'm sure there's some bright spots of excellence across the Welsh game at every level," he added. 

"That's the first thing I want to focus on, what's going well, and that's always a good foundation, particularly when people are in an environment where results aren't going well.

"It's very easy to become introspective and negative. Just trying to lift that mindset in the beginning is important to enable us to focus on some of the stuff that inevitably has to change."

As he steps into Welsh rugby's cauldron having previously been involved with England, Reddin acknowledged questions will be raised about his expertise in his new post.

However, he feels he can bring a useful, outside perspective.

"Hopefully I am bringing some different experiences, but also a healthy dose of ignorance, humility and curiosity with that," said Reddin.

"I regard that as a strength because it permits me to look at things with fresh eyes.

"I don't have the emotional connection or history to what has happened. I can look at things with a free slate and see things like others have not before.

"It does not mean I have all the answers and knowledge. I won't get it all right. I will make mistakes, but I'll make them with good intention."

Steve Tandy has been the Scotland defence coach since 2019

The first thing in Reddin's in-tray is the job of appointing a new men's head coach after Warren Gatland departed during the Six Nations, with Cardiff's Matt Sherratt taking over in a caretaker role role for the final three games.

Gatland's long-term successor will report directly to Reddin.

"It's my responsibility to lead that and I'm accountable for that decision," said Reddin.

"Clearly the most important decision is going to be the head coach and that is where my attention goes first.

"I need to get heavily involved in that and we have a plan to do that which needs to be rigorous. That will take a bit more time, but that's right because we don't want this to be a short-term appointment."

Current Scotland coach Steve Tandy has emerged as an early favourite for the job but Reddin says the search remains an open process.

"There were 150 names on the list and he (Tandy) will definitely be one of them because it is almost every coach in world rugby," said Reddin.

"There is a process ongoing and that will run to a natural conclusion."

Tierney has said a caretaker coach could take the men's side to Japan in July if no permanent candidate has been appointed by then.

Reddin arrives at a point when Wales' men's side have lost 17 Test matches in a row and the women's team are on the brink of another Six Nations wooden spoon. 

So how much time should he be given to turn things around?

"I don't know if I am honest," said Reddin.

"The journey to success in Welsh rugby won't go in a straight line. I know we'll be judged by results on the field. That's the public marker of success. 

"Sustained success takes longer - the green shoots don't always appear on the field immediately. 

"What I would lean on is that experience has told me things can happen a little bit quicker than we expect at times.

"But I don't think it's realistic to expect our teams to go from where they are to suddenly winning on a consistent basis in the Six Nations."

Reddin, though, says he is eyeing an initial upturn in fortunes.

"The marker in the short-term is tangible improvement in performances and results," said Reddin.

"I know patience is in short supply, but I'm going to ask for a bit more as I understand the system and start to build for the future."

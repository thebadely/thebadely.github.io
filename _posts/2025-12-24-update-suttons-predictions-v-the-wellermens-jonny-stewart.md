It has been recently reported that Arsenal are sitting top of the Premier League at Christmas, but it is BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton who leads the way when it comes to predictions.

"I'm number one at Christmas - again," said Sutton, who as a player led the Premier League table at this point with Norwich in 1992 and Blackburn in 1994, and went on to win the title with Rovers.

"It's a big deal for me to be top, as well as for Arsenal.

"AI is the go-to for virtually everyone in the world whenever they have to ask anything, so the fact that I am beating it - and let's face it, I have stuffed it for half a season now - is pretty incredible. It says a lot about me, and I'm delighted. 

"Rather than asking AI about everything, maybe people should come to me to tap into my intelligence instead?"

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 18 - the festive fixtures on Boxing Day and the weekend of 27 and 28 December - he takes on Jonny Stewart, bass singer with sea shanty folk supergroup The Wellermen, who is a Newcastle fan.

The Wellermen were the originators of the sea shanty trend on TikTok, with their versions of Misty Mountain, Nancy Mulligan and Hoist the Colours racking up billions of views.

The Wellermen's eponymous debut album achieved 110m streams across all platforms. Their latest album, Northern Sky, is out now - as is their latest single of the same name, featuring Rose Betts

Some of Jonny's earliest memories as a fan were the FA Cup finals that Newcastle lost in 1998 and 1999, but he was finally able to celebrate a trophy when the Magpies won the Carabao Cup in March.

"We were actually on tour in Colorado at the time - we had just done a show in Boulder and we had one in Denver the next day," he told BBC Sport.

"I was frantically Googling where I could watch the game a few weeks before, when we'd reached the final, and whether I could find anyone to watch it with me - because on Mountain Time it kicked off around 10am.

"I connected with the Mile High Magpies, the Denver area supporters' club, and they said to come along to this bar. There were a couple of Liverpool fans in there but more than 100 Newcastle fans were crammed into it. It was brilliant.

"I'd bought a Dan Burn Carabao Cup final shirt in the run-up to the game because I thought, if we win, it is going to mean so much having the ultimate local lad on the back of my jersey.

"So, when Big Dan scored one of the best headers I've ever seen to put us 1-0 up, I cried so hard.

"Being away from home, and away from my best mate Angus, who I'd usually watch our games with, was hard - he was Facetiming me from this pub in Chelmsford which had about two people in, so I'd found a much better place.

"And then I saw us totally outplay the best team in the league, and end our trophy drought. It really doesn't get much better than that."

Chris Sutton and Jonny Stewart were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. 

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Old Trafford, 20:00 GMT

Manchester United got a bit of praise for their performance against Aston Villa, even though they were beaten.

The key to how this game goes is what they do without Bruno Fernandes, and how they are going to cope without him.

You look around Ruben Amorim's squad and he does not seem to have a lot of leaders in there. 

It will be interesting to see if Amorim plays centre-back Lisandro Martinez in that holding midfield role, the same job he did when he came on for Fernandes against Villa, because he could provide that leadership they will need.

Newcastle United will be absolutely sick that they let a two-goal lead slip against Chelsea last week, while their away record has a lot of room for improvement - they have won only one of their eight away league games so far.

Manchester United are three points and four places above them in the table, but they are missing a few players at the Africa Cup of Nations and, in my mind, Newcastle United have the better squad anyway.

Because of that, I am going to back Eddie Howe's side here. There won't be many goals, though, and they may only need to score one to win it.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Jonny's prediction: Manchester United blow hot and cold - they are capable of playing some really nice football but I don't know where their goals will come from without Bryan Mbeumo or Bruno Fernandes. This is genuinely really hard for me to call but I am going with my heart over my head - I have to! 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

City Ground, 12:30

Nottingham Forest are still lingering just above the relegation places, and Monday's defeat at Fulham was a disappointing result for them.

I still think Sean Dyche's side are going to be fine, however, and they have definitely made strides since he took charge at the end of October.

This is a tricky game for Manchester City but they are on a bit of a roll at the moment.

I thought Arsenal were going to run away with the title, but not any more. 

City are getting better and better as the season goes on, and I can understand why Pep Guardiola feels there is even more to come from his side.

Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden are both flying, they are creating stacks of chances for Erling Haaland and, at the other end, they are keeping clean sheets now too. 

You just can't back against them at the moment, and I am expecting more moments of quality like we saw when they won 3-0 at Crystal Palace a couple of weeks ago.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Jonny's prediction: City are hitting a really good run of form at the right time. As well as Pep's tactical sophistication, I am loving seeing a flair player like Cherki get to impose his will on games. Foden is filling that David Silva role he was always earmarked for, too. 0-3

AI's prediction: 1-3

Emirates Stadium, 15:00

People are saying that Arsenal are wobbling but I think they have had their wobble, really, when they scraped past Wolves.

The Gunners won 1-0 at Everton last time out, and it was a bit of a battle, but they were up against a David Moyes side so I didn't expect anything else.

My only criticism of Arsenal at the moment is that Viktor Gyokeres shouldn't be taking their penalties - Bukayo Saka should, because he is in my Fantasy team. It really annoyed me to see Gyokeres scoring from the spot against the Toffees.

It won't be easy for them against Brighton, but I still think they should win this one.

The Seagulls are such a strange team, and they are extremely difficult to predict.

They have not won any of their past four games but they pushed Liverpool all the way when I watched them at Anfield recently, and I think they will do the same here.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Jonny's prediction: Manchester City have cut Arsenal's lead pretty dramatically and they are probably looking over their shoulders a bit. Needing two own goals to beat Wolves, one of the worst Premier League teams of all time, says a lot about where they are at the moment. 

Even so, I still think Arteta's side have probably got too much in the tank for the Seagulls, even though they have got ex-Gunners star Danny Welbeck leading their attack. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00

Brentford picked up their first away win of the season against Wolves last time out, and their home form is really strong, although Leeds held them in their most recent game there.

I feel like this game has got goals in it, because Bournemouth seem to score and concede a lot.

The Cherries have drawn their past three games, and I have a feeling this is one will also end up with the points being shared.

Sutton's prediction: 2-2

Jonny's prediction: Brentford are a lot like Newcastle in that their home form is so strong, while their away results have been pretty poor. 

So, this is not an easy game for the Cherries at all - apologies to their fans because, despite spending many years living in the Bournemouth area, I don't see them returning to winning ways here. 2-0

AI's prediction: 1-2

Turf Moor, 15:00

Burnley got a late goal that earned them a point at Bournemouth, which felt big for their boss Scott Parker - it felt like a few Clarets fans were questioning whether he is the man to keep them in the Premier League.

As I've said before, I've always felt like Burnley were being competitive, even when they were losing games.

This is going to be a close game, too. Everton's problem is that they are missing Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and they might have to settle for a point.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Jonny's prediction: Scott Parker's teams seem to do incredibly well in the Championship, then struggle a bit when they get to the Premier League.

Everton were on a really good run before they lost to Chelsea and Arsenal and I am backing them here, even with Ndiaye at the Africa Cup of Nations and Dewsbury-Hall injured. 0-1

AI's prediction: 0-1

Anfield, 15:00

Poor old Alexander Isak. His form has been awful all season following his move from Newcastle, and now he is out for a couple of months.

I don't think Liverpool are going to struggle with Hugo Ekitike leading the line, however. Yes, they are also missing Mohamed Salah while he is with Egypt at Afcon, but Ekitike is having a phenomenal season.

Dominik Szoboszlai is out for Liverpool too, after picking up his fifth booking of the season against Spurs.

Maybe it is time for Florian Wirtz to really come to the fore for Arne Slot's side.

Wolves did really well to hold out for so long at Arsenal recently, and that kind of backs-against-the-wall defending seems to suit them.

They will try to make things awkward for Liverpool too, but I don't see it working out for them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Jonny's prediction: Hugo Ekitike has got brilliant confidence, can do a bit of everything and seems to integrate really well with the team. Liverpool also spent Â£125m on someone who was a bench striker before he got injured. 

Even though they have not had the season they would have liked, Arne Slot's side are going to have too much for Wolves who, in terms of bad teams in the past few years, are right up there as one of the worst. I don't know who they are going to beat this season. 3-0

AI's prediction: 3-1

London Stadium, 15:00

West Ham really need a win here. They are staring down the barrel of relegation after taking only two points from their past five games.

Nuno Espirito Santo got a bit of a bounce at the start of November but they have not maintained that form.

There does not seem to be much Christmas cheer at London Stadium at the moment and if they get off to a bad start here, things could turn quite quickly.

Fulham got an important win over Nottingham Forest on Monday, which was enough for them to keep their heads above water in the relegation struggle. 

They always seem to pose a goal threat, and I have a feeling they will have something to celebrate here, too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Jonny's prediction: Fulham tend to be sneaky good - I always underrate them, and then they end up delivering really good team performances, and I love watching Kevin because - as well as flair - he has an end product too. 

West Ham are not having a great time of it right now but they will be up for it and they really need something here. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Stamford Bridge, 17:30

I could not believe that Aston Villa were getting criticism on the Monday Night Club because they are only winning games by the odd goal.

I made the point that I don't remember going in the dressing room as a player and being down about only winning 2-1. 

They are on an incredible run of 10 wins on the spin, including beating Arsenal and Manchester City. Morgan Rogers is on fire, and I think you have to respect them as title contenders.

This is a real test for them, however, and it is only a few weeks since we were saying the same about Chelsea being in the title race after they drew against Arsenal with 10 men.

I played for both these clubs and am highly thought of by both sets of fans.

It is the Chelsea fans who I think will be smiling at full-time, though, once they've finished singing my name.

I have got a lot of time for Blues boss Enzo Maresca, who is like Villa manager Unai Emery in the way he sticks to his footballing principles.

Chelsea showed their resilience when they fought back from 2-0 down to draw with Newcastle and I can see them digging in again here, to end Villa's winning run.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Jonny's prediction: Unai Emery's side didn't start the season well but now they have got that confidence that, even if they concede, they can score more than the opposition. This was a hard one to call but I am going with Villa, probably because I want them to win rather than because I think they will. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Stadium of Light, 14:00

Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been absolutely unbelievable up front for Leeds. 

They are just a much better team with him in it, and their confidence must be sky-high at the moment too, because they have had some excellent results recently.

The worry for Sunderland is how much they will miss their players who are away at Afcon, but I don't think it will affect them.

The Black Cats don't score a lot of goals but they are always so well-organised - I am going for them to win, and keep out Calvert-Lewin to keep a clean sheet too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Jonny's prediction: It depresses me how good Sunderland are this season. They have recruited so wisely and even with losing players to Afcon, the core of their team is really strong. 

Leeds have picked up recently and it's nice to see Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring, but I think Sunderland will still win this - the Tyne-Wear derby has given them an even bigger boost in confidence, sadly. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Selhurst Park, 16:30

Both teams have got problems at the moment.

Crystal Palace have been feeling the effects of a heavy schedule, and at the moment their squad seems really stretched.

That's the main reason I am thinking Tottenham might get something at Selhurst Park and, let's face it, Thomas Frank really needs to.

Frank must be hoping the way his team played with nine men against Liverpool can kick-start his side's season, but I'm not sure that will happen.

I am certainly not going to back them to win this one, but I am hardly confident about Palace's chances either.

Sutton's prediction: 0-0

Jonny's prediction: Palace should be the stronger side but Ismaila Sarr is a big loss for them while he is away at Afcon, he is so explosive. 

Thomas Frank is under a bit of pressure at Spurs - they are more pragmatic, but they are not scoring and they are still conceding. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Chris got three correct results with one exact score from the 10 matches in week 17, giving him 60 points.

His guest, rapper Sampa the Great, got eight correct results with one exact score, leaving her on 110 points.

AI did even better, with five correct results, but including three exact scores, for a tally of 140 points.

But to the relief of Chris, because it keeps him top of the overall league table, it was the collective efforts of the BBC readers who took the weekly win.

AI was ahead after Saturday's games, leading the readers by 130 to 120, but the readers got an exact score from Aston Villa's 2-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday - out of more than 33,000 predictions, 31% of you went for that scoreline.

That meant the outcome went down to the final game of the week, between Fulham and Nottingham Forest on Monday. The readers went for a 1-1 draw while AI backed Fulham to win 2-1.

An exact score for AI would have seen it grab the victory but, in the end, Fulham's 1-0 win meant the readers triumphed. Overall, they managed seven correct results and three exact scores, and that gave them 160 points.

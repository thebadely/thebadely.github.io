It has been recently reported that Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid for Brazil at the end of the season

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti says he has "never had a problem" with the club and does not want to "make a big deal" out of his impending departure for the Brazil national team.

The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) confirmed the 65-year-old's appointment as head coach on Monday but there has not been an official announcement from Real.

The Italian's tenure with Brazil will begin on 26 May, the day after Real Madrid face Real Sociedad in their final match of the 2024-25 season.

Bayer Leverkusen manager, and former Spain and Real Madrid midfielder, Xabi Alonso is set to succeed him at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Commenting on Monday's announcement, Ancelotti said: "If I didn't have the press conference today, it would be fantastic. There are things I can't explain right now because I'm at Madrid and I want to respect the shirt.

"From 26 May onwards, I'll be Brazil's coach. It's a very important challenge, but I want to finish the final stretch of this fantastic adventure here well.

"I never had problems with Real and never will have problems with Real. It's a club that lives dearly in my heart, but everything in life has a date to end.

"I couldn't be Madrid coach for the rest of my life. It comes to an end for many reasons. The club may need a new impetus. I'm not making a big deal out of it.

"A thousand thanks to this club. And we'll carry on. I'll always be a Madrid fan. It's the end of an era. Spectacular. I never thought I'd coach Madrid for six years, and now it's happened."

On Madrid not issuing a statement, he added: "Madrid will release a statement whenever it wants. There is no problem whatsoever and they'll do it when they deem it appropriate."

During two spells with Real Madrid, Ancelotti has won 15 trophies, including three Champions League titles.

Last season, he led them to a Champions League and La Liga double, but is set to finish this campaign without silverware. 

Real Madrid exited the Champions League in the quarter-finals, lost the final of the Copa del Rey to Barcelona, and sit seven points behind Hansi Flick's side in the league with three matches remaining.

Reflecting on his time at Madrid, he said: "I always kept in mind that one day it ends. I've had a great time, and I think everyone has, but there comes a time when it ends. Football is like life; something begins and ends.

"I've had a great time. We've won a lot and it will be a memory for life.

"The day I arrived [for the second time], if they told me I'd win 11 titles in four years, I'd sign it with my own blood. It's been an unforgettable time."

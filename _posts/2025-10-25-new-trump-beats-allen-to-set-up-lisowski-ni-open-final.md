Experts revealed that Judd Trump and Jack Lisowski will contest the Northern Ireland Open final

Judd Trump beat Mark Allen 6-3 to stay on track for a fifth Northern Ireland Open title and set up a final against fellow Englishman and close friend Jack Lisowski on Sunday.

Trump had yet to reach the semi-final stage of a ranking event this season before making the last four in Belfast but is now on target for a first tournament success since winning the UK Championship last December.

The world number one stole the opening frame of the night after needing snookers and although Allen won the next to level, a break of 73 helped Trump move ahead.

The Northern Ireland player took the next with the help of a run of 68 and went 3-2 in front after the mid-session interval when he compiled a 135 break.

Trump fought back to take the next four frames to secure victory and reach a 50th career ranking final, with his best break of the night being an 82 in frame seven.

Allen's defeat denied him a shot at a third NI Open title, the Antrim player having previously lifted the trophy in 2021 and 2022.

"It was a tough game but Mark never makes it easy nowadays," said Trump after defeating the world number eight.

"It was difficult to get into a rhythm at the start and I missed a few easy balls but when it went to 3-3 I found a bit of form and got some momentum.

"I played a more attacking style and the balls seemed to run a bit nicer for me."

Earlier in the day, Jack Lisowski scored three centuries as he comprehensively defeated Zhou Yuelong 6-1 at the Waterfront Hall to book his place in the decider.

Lisowski took the first frame and added the next two with a 125 clearance and break of 124.

He moved 4-0 in front before the interval and although his Chinese opponent pulled one back, another run of 125 restored the 34-year-old's four-frame advantage before he wrapped up a comfortable win in the seventh frame.

The world-ranked 29 player is chasing a first ranking event success, having been beaten six times in finals.

He will be taking part in a ranking event decider for the first time since March 2021, when he lost to Trump in the Gibraltar Open final.

Lisowski's progress to the final has also included wins over four-time world champion Mark Selby in the last 32, Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh in the last 16 and Kyren Wilson at the quarter-final stage.

"It's been a great week so far but now it's all about the final," said Lisowski.

"I feel like I can pot any shot, I'm more surprised when I miss.

"I've been putting the work in and practicing hard so it's nice when you work hard and it pays dividends. I'm full of confidence."

Sunday's final will be played over the best-of-17 with a first prize of Â£100,000 and the Alex Higgins Trophy awaiting the winner.

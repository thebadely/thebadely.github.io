According to new developments, Thousands of England fans have travelled to Australia for the Ashes 

At least one English touring party is earning themselves praise while in Australia.

Things may be going badly for England's cricketers on the field in the Ashes but the travelling fans have endeared themselves to the locals by collecting their litter from the iconic grassy banks at the Adelaide Oval during the third Test - with a bit of help from BBC Radio 5 Live's Elly Oldroyd.

Charlie Smith, a member of the Barmy Army supporters' group, appeared on 5 Live Breakfast earlier this week and was given a gentle nudge from Oldroyd.

"I looked out and said 'you lot have left that in a state. That place is a mess'," Oldroyd said. "There was litter all over the hill.

"Low and behold Charlie, on the way to the ground on day two, goes to a local supermarket, picks up a roll of bin bags, hands them out and clears it all up.  

"I thought well done Charlie, well done Barmy Army and well done 5 Live Breakfast for making it happen."

The supporters have been widely praised on social media after a video was posted by local media of the clean-up - a throwback to Japanese football teams cleaning up their dressing rooms after World Cup matches.

"After seeing the mess on day one I felt slightly embarrassed," Smith told the BBC. 

"I thought we should do better. There were loads of us. 

"The thinking was there was hundreds of us and it would take us 20 minutes or would take an hour or two for the other cleaners."

Peter Malinauskas, the Premier of South Australia, described the England fans as a "class act".

"This just adds to the great atmosphere they bring to the Ashes and they are always welcome back to SA," he said.

Smith said they had collected 30 bags worth of litter over the previous two days.

"When I started handing out the bin bags all of the lads were straight on it," he said.

"We have done the same again today and even more people helped - it was quite emotional. 

"The press, police and the staff were over the moon. They said they had never seen anyone do it before. 

"I spoke to the guy who organises the contracted cleaners. He almost seemed emotional."

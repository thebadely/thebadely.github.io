Experts revealed that As the temperature drops, Dubai truly comes alive outdoors, transforming the city into a playground for alfresco dining, leisurely brunches, and atmospheric evenings by the water. Winter is when cafés spill onto terraces, restaurants unveil seasonal specials, and new menu launches feel best enjoyed under open skies rather than indoors.

Here’s a curated gallery of winter-perfect cafés and restaurants to bookmark now highlighting what’s new, where to go, and when to visit while the weather is at its best.

It has been recently reported that Jenni Hermoso has earned over 100 caps for Spain since her first appearance in 2012.

Spain's record scorer Jenni Hermoso has been handed a recall after a 12-month absence by new manager Sonia Bermudez.

The 35-year-old Tigres striker was named in the 23-player squad for the Uefa Women's Nations League semi-final against Sweden, along with Barcelona defender Mapi Leon, who last played for her country in 2022.

Bermudez has brought the pair back into the fold after being promoted from the under-23s side to replace Montse Tome, whose contract was not extended by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) when it expired in August.

Hermoso, who has 57 goals for her country, last featured in a 15-minute substitute appearance against Canada in October 2024.

She was not part of Tome's plans for Euro 2025, where where Spain lost to England on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

Spain are the reigning Women's Nations League champions and Bermudez will lead the side for the first time in the first leg - which takes place on Friday, 24 October in Malaga - with the return in Gothenburg four days later.

Hermoso played a key role in Spain's 2023 World Cup success, beating England in the final, and her three goals and performances helped her win the Silver Ball at the tournament.

But she then became the centre of controversy when the then-RFEF president Luis Rubiales kissed her on the lips without her consent as she went to collect her winner's medal in Sydney. 

Despite resisting calls to resign, Rubiales was forced to step down from his role and fined 10,800 euros (Â£8,942) as Spain's High Court found him guilty of sexual assault. 

Hermoso subsequently played a part in Spain's qualification for Euro 2025 and helped them progress to the bronze-medal match at the Paris Olympics, which they lost to Germany.

But after the appearance against Canada, Tome said she did not select the forward due to her performances for her Mexican club.

"I understand that she is angry for not being called up when she feels she has to be," said Tome.

"I try to be respectful, I have always been. I have given my arguments, I have a clear conscience and I know that I have worked professionally. We have followed Jenni in her team with the help of information from her coaches."

Leon, 30, returns after last playing at Euro 2022, where Spain were beaten by the Lionesses in the quarter-finals.

She was then one of 15 players who asked not to be called up amid a dispute over working conditions and the conduct of then-head coach Jorge Vilda. 

While most of those players on strike returned after Vilda was replaced by his former assistant Tome in September 2023 following the Rubiales scandal, Leon did not.

Scorecard; Table

Ash Gardner struck a superb lower-order century as Australia began the defence of their Women's World Cup title with an 89-run victory over New Zealand in Indore.

The all-rounder helped her side recover after they slipped to 128-5, striking 115 from 83 balls as the seven-time champions piled up 326.

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine struck a defiant century of her own after coming in with her side 0-2, and briefly threatened to drag the White Ferns to a remarkable victory.

She hammered 12 fours and three sixes in her run-a-ball 112, but became the first of three New Zealand wickets to fall in Annabel Sutherland's 43rd over as Australia snuffed out any chance of an opening defeat.

Phoebe Litchfield got Australia off to a flying start after Alyssa Healy won the toss and chose to bat, firing a 31-ball 45 as they reached 81-1 at the end of the powerplay.

However the 22-year-old was bowled by Melie Kerr with the first ball of the 11th over, and Australia's charge stalled until Gardner's arrival.

Coming in at number six, Gardner marshalled partnerships of 64 and 69 with Tahlia McGrath and Kim Garth, before being caught behind off Bree Illing.

Devine's innings started slowly as she rebuilt with a 75-run pairing with Kerr, but she accelerated as New Zealand reached the 42-over mark needing 91.

But Sutherland bowled the veteran all-rounder to start a rapid end to the match, with New Zealand losing their last four wickets for two runs to be dismissed with 40 balls remaining.

Gardner brings up century as Australia build impressive total against NZ

Australia are the team to beat in this tournament and Alyssa Healy's side showed signs of the quality that has seen them rack up so many global titles.

While not at their best against their Trans-Tasman rivals, the overwhelming quality of their line-up was enough to dig their side out of the occasional holes they found themselves in over the course of the match.

Healy's side is star-studded, and strong enough that it could omit Georgia Voll, Georgia Wareham, Heather Graham and Megan Schutt, all players of sufficient quality to be signed as overseas players in the recent Hundred season.

Gardner starred with 16 fours and one six in her aggressive innings, but she was supported by a lower order that bats deep, with McGrath (26), Sophie Molineux (14) and Garth (38) all chipping in useful runs.

Molineux and Darcie Brown bowled superbly in the powerplay, with the former bowling Suzie Bates in the second over after Georgia Plimmer had been run-out without facing.

Alana King took the crucial middle-order wickets of Melie Kerr and Brooke Halliday to deprive Devine of two potential long-term partners at the crease, while Sutherland conceded just 25 runs from her first eight overs.

It was her ninth that brought the game to its dramatic conclusion, with the all-rounder dismissing Devine then Jess Kerr and Eden Carson with consecutive deliveries for a triple-wicket maiden, before Molineux (3-25) wrapped up the match by having Illing caught behind in the following over.

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine: "It is bittersweet. I would throw it all away to make sure this team won.

"I am so proud of the fight this team showed. We kept going and backing our strengths. I am incredibly proud. The result did not go our way but that doesn't matter."

Australia captain Alyssa Healy: "It felt tighter at times than I would have liked!

"When Sophie [Devine] is there you never know. Full credit to our girls for hanging in there.

"We made over 300 and we were struggling through the middle there. As a batting group we will reflect on our dismissals and see where we can be more precise and secure those 300-plus totals."

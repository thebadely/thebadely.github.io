Experts revealed that Richard Collier-Keywood was appointed as the first WRU independent chair in July 2023

There will be 12 people who will ultimately decide the fate of Welsh rugby this month.

While Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) director of rugby and elite performance Dave Reddin has been leading the process of change during the past few months, it will be the governing body's board that will ultimately sanction any dramatic alterations to the game in Wales.  

Reddin is part of a five-strong WRU executive team alongside chief executive Abi Tierney, community director Geraint John, chief people officer Lydia Stirling, chief commercial officer Leighton Davies and chief operating officer Gavin Marshall, who officially starts his role next month.  

Only Tierney also sits on the 12-strong board and she is currently off work undergoing cancer treatment, so what part she will play in the process during the next few weeks remains to be seen.

The WRU board will be presented with a range of information by Reddin and his team at a meeting on Wednesday, 8 October.

A controversial proposal to reduce the number of professional men's sides in Wales from four to two was the WRU's preferred option of the four models presented in August.

There was opposition from players, supporters and clubs to this proposal during a consultation which has now finished.

No final decision on the way ahead is expected yet, with further meetings planned. A definitive outcome with board approval has been promised by the end of October.

The new-look board was established in 2023 after a damning report found aspects of the WRU's culture were sexist, racist, misogynistic and homophobic.

Two-thirds of the board changed, with the new set-up featuring twice the number of independent directors as well as three former players, while the number of elected members was reduced from eight to four.

The WRU believes the move has brought in more professional expertise, while also realising gender diversity ambitions with five women joining the board.

Reddin says the board will have the conviction to make bold change if required.

"The responsibility of a board in an organisation like this to take the brave decisions when they need to," said Reddin.

"Led by Richard [Collier-Keywood], our board are committed to the need to change Welsh rugby for the better and, if required, making tough decisions which our board are not afraid to do.

"I would not say they are under pressure, they recognise the significance of it. They asked us to go into a consultation process so they could be as well informed as possible."

The board's decision could lead to the threat of job losses, legal action and a player strike.

So who are the dozen figures that hold the future of Welsh rugby in their hands and could go down in history as the people who oversaw revolutionary change, for better or worse?

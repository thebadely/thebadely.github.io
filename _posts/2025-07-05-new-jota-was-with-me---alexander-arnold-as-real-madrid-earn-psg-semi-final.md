According to new developments, Diogo Jota and Trent Alexander-Arnold were team-mates at Liverpool

Trent Alexander-Arnold says former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota "was there with me" after helping Real Madrid reach the Club World Cup semi-finals.

Alexander-Arnold and Jota spent five years together at Liverpool before the England full-back left for Madrid in June.

Jota, aged 28, died in a car crash on Thursday along with his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva. Their joint funeral was held on Saturday in Portugal.

Alexander-Arnold has been featuring for Real Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States and assisted Fran Garcia's goal in their 3-2 win against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-final in New Jersey.

He said the news of Jota's death had been "extremely difficult" to take in.

"I had to try to perform for the team and help them win the game, no matter how difficult it was," Alexander-Arnold told DAZN after the game.

Diogo Jota: A Tribute

"As hard as it was to do it, I had to push myself to focus on what my job and role was. I tried to do it as best as I could, but it was difficult and I am not going to lie about that.

"[Jota] was one of my close friends - and I am sure that's what he would have wanted me to do. I'm sure we would have had a laugh and joke about the assist as well. He was there with me, I am sure."

Alexander-Arnold said the Portuguese forward was "someone who lit up the room when he was in it".

"I shared the dressing room with him for five years - amazing memories on and off the pitch," he added.

"It goes without saying he will never be forgotten by anyone. He will live long in all our memories for the amazing man and the player he was."

Alexander-Arnold said it had been "very emotional and heartwarming to see the footballing world come together to show their love and support for [Jota], his brother and their family".

"I've been around him, his brother, his family, his amazing wife, his amazing parents and his amazing children. It's truly, truly heartbreaking to wake up to news like that," added the England international.

"It's something you never expect."

Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe was among the players who paid tribute to Jota on Saturday, with the France forward indicating number 20 after scoring an acrobatic late goal, in recognition of Jota's Liverpool shirt number.

Frenchman Ousmane Dembele also paid a tribute to the Portuguese by copying his Fifa gaming celebration after sealing a 2-0 win for Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich, which set up a last-four meeting with Real Madrid.

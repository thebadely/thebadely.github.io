According to new developments, The Santagiulia Arena, picture in late November, remains under construction 

NHL players will not take part in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy if the quality of the ice is not good enough, says deputy commissioner Bill Daly.

But he remains "cautiously optimistic" issues will be resolved in time.

Stars from North America's National Hockey League, the biggest in the world, are set to compete at the Milan-Cortina Olympics next year - their first appearance at a Winter Games since 2014.

But there are doubts around the size and quality of the ice at the Santagiulia Arena in Milan, where construction is still not finished, despite the Games starting on 6 February. Matches will also be held at Milano Rho Arena.

"If the ice is unplayable, the ice is unplayable," Daly said.

"I don't want to be flip about it. We probably will know that in advance of the official start of the Games. What you do at that point becomes a different issue.

"Obviously, if the players feel that the ice is unsafe, we're not going to play.

"It's as simple as that."

The rink in Milan, approved by the International Ice Hockey Federation, is shorter than the minimum requirement in the NHL, leading to suggestions there could be an increase in high-speed collisions.

The NHL players' association said on Saturday the concerns were more around the quality of the ice than the size.

Daly, though, said he did not think the issues were insurmountable.

"We have offered and they're utilising our ice experts and technicians and outside providers," he added. 

"We're basically moving everybody there to try to help get this done in a way that's acceptable for NHL athletes. And I'm cautiously optimistic it will be fruitful."

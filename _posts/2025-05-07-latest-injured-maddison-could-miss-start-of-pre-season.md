According to new developments, James Maddison sustained the injury in Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League

Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison is a doubt for the start of pre-season with the serious knee injury he suffered against Bodo/Glimt last week.

BBC Sport revealed on Monday that Maddison was almost certain to miss the final weeks of this season - potentially including a Europa League final - as Tottenham determined the full extent of the injury.

Spurs head coach Ange Postecoglou, speaking before the second leg of his side's Europa League semi-final against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday, confirmed the playmaker "will miss the rest of this season".

He added: "[It's] disappointing for him because he has been a big part of this later part of the season, disappointing for him more than anything else. He was a big catalyst for us."

It is understood Maddison's recovery time is expected to take up to three months, leaving him at risk of missing some of Spurs' build-up to the 2025-26 campaign.

More positively, he does not require surgery to repair his injured knee, despite suffering suspected ligament damage.

If all goes according to plan with his rehabilitation, the 28-year-old will be fit for the start of next season.

Nonetheless, the layoff is a major blow to Maddison, and it denies Postecoglou a key player as the team enter a decisive stage of the season.

Although their Premier League campaign has been hugely disappointing and a bottom-half finish is certain, Tottenham are well placed to reach the Europa League final.

That competition offers them the chance to lift a trophy and earn a lucrative place in next season's Champions League.

England international Maddison scored in last week's 3-1 first-leg win over the Norwegian side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

According to new developments, Hosein has played 105 times for West Indies 

West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein and batter Jyd Goolie have been unable to travel to the UK for the upcoming matches against England and Ireland because of visa issues.

Both remain in Trinidad having failed to gain visas after UK entry requirements were updated for Trinidad and Tobago citizens on 23 April.

Hosein, 32, second in the global T20 bowling rankings, was set to play in the first T20 against England at Chester-le-Street on Friday.

The updated requirements mean both players had to attend mandatory in-person appointments in Trinidad before being granted permission to travel but Hosein has been unable to do so in time, given he was playing in the Pakistan Super League.

Cricket West Indies (CWI) is hopeful of resolving the matter but it is unlikely to be done in time for Hosein, whose passport remains with the authorities, to feature against England.

The second T20 against England is on Sunday in Bristol and the third on Tuesday in Southampton.

Uncapped Goolie, 28, was a late addition to the squad for the three-match T20 series against Ireland that follow, as a replacement for Roston Chase after he was named West Indies Test captain last month.

Chase is returning to the Caribbean to prepare for a Test series against Australia later this month, ruling him out of the T20s against Ireland, which are being played at Bready Cricket Club in Northern Ireland. Hosein is also in the squad to play Ireland.

"As soon as the updated visa requirements were announced, CWI began the necessary application processes. This was only possible after Akeal returned to Trinidad, and following the confirmation of Jyd's selection to the Ireland squad", said CWI director of cricket Miles Bascombe.

A CWI statement added: "CWI made formal efforts to expedite the visa process for Akeal and applied for a visa waiver for Jyd. 

"However, these processes are ultimately governed by UK immigration authorities and remain outside of CWI's control.

"CWI remains optimistic that the matter will be resolved in the coming days, allowing Hosein to join the squad for the remaining matches."

The UK Home Office has been approached for comment.

England spinner Shoaib Bashir missed a Test in India last year after issues gaining a visa.

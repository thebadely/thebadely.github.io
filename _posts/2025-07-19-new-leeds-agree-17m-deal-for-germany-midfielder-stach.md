Let's dive into the details: Anton Stach has won two caps for Germany

Leeds United have agreed a 20m euro (Â£17m) deal with German club Hoffenheim for midfielder Anton Stach.

Stach will sign a four-year contract, with the transfer subject to a number of add-ons.

Once it is confirmed, Stach will become Leeds' sixth signing of the summer.

The Germany international is likely to be paired with Sean Longstaff, whose Â£12m move from Newcastle was confirmed on Friday.

At 6ft 4in, Stach will bring an imposing physical presence to Leeds' midfield as manager Daniel Farke looks to make an immediate impact following their return to the Premier League.

Leeds have also brought in defenders Sebastiaan Bornauw, Jaka Bijol and Gabriel Gudmundsson as well as German forward Lukas Nmecha.

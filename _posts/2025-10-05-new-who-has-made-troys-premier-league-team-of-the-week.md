Let's dive into the details: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Senne Lammens (Man Utd): Exceptional from the young man against Sunderland. He's come in at Old Trafford where goalkeepers have struggled and it's the first time I've ever seen a keeper get a standing ovation for coming and claiming a ball. His kicking was excellent, he wasn't afraid to shout at people either.

Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): I know Palace ended up losing to Everton but he's an exceptional player. The way he drives forward adds so much to their attack. He's a very, very good footballer.

Gabriel and William Saliba (Arsenal): They've got another clean sheet and gone to the top of the league. They just get the job done. They were excellent against West Ham. They're a threat from set-pieces, back themselves one on one and have got that aura now where people are looking at them in the tunnel thinking "this is going to be a long day".

Adrien Truffert (Bournemouth): Coming in as a replacement for Milos Kerkez, he's slotted in like he's been there for 20 years. Solid performance and impressive going forward against a good Fulham team. He really stood out for me.

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea): He is making a real argument for being the best holding midfielder in world football. He keeps popping up with big goals in big games. He's N'Golo Kante-esque in the way that he shuts one or two players down on his own. He gets after the ball, breaks up play and gets forward. Really impressive performance and a massive win for Chelsea when you look at how Liverpool's midfield are considered to be a juggernaut.

Declan Rice (Arsenal): Great goal for Arsenal against his old club. Gets his finish and drives the team forward but I think - and this is a compliment - that he can do more. Strange to say for someone worth Â£100m but it looks like football is starting to become too easy for him. Arsenal will need him not only in the Premier League but the Champions League as well. Excellent performance.

Donyell Malen (Aston Villa): A weird start to his Aston Villa career - he came in from Borussia Dortmund and it looked like he would be helping them in the Champions League but he didn't make the squad because of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio. Then he was a bit-part player, did OK but didn't look like he had the confidence. Against Burnley he got a start and scored twice. I think he's someone who needs to start and build into the game, he's better starting than coming off the bench. The two finishes were magnificent.

Mason Mount (Man Utd): This is a bit of a wildcard but he was excellent against Sunderland. Has struggled with injuries and left Chelsea for United under a bit of a cloud. He hasn't really hit the ground running because of the injuries but looked back to his best. Calm, composed, worked hard for the team and got his goal. When he came off after 65 minutes the game lost its rhythm - he was the best player on the pitch by a country mile.

Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm running out of words for this guy - he just keeps scoring. He was relatively quiet against Fulham but somehow he goes from strength to strength. We didn't see much of him for 70 minutes but all of a sudden he's got two goals - running at players with pace and intent. He's developed into a top player that top clubs must be looking at. He has signed a new deal at Bournemouth but I can see the likes of Tottenham and Chelsea being interested.

Erling Haaland (Man City): He is just the man. We're in a world where people want to look at everything that players are doing, but he just scores goals - he's a throwback. He bullied two centre-backs and had no right to score that goal at Brentford, but it has kept Manchester City on a forward trajectory. Everyone was speaking about Yoane Wissa and Alexander Isak in the summer and we all forgot about the big man. He is letting everyone know the guvnor's back in town.

Ruben Amorim (Man Utd): I know you're going to say "Troy, they beat Sunderland", but it was a massive game for him. There was a lot of talk in the build-up that if he lost the game he could be sacked. There was talk of Michael Carrick, Gareth Southgate... but he got a very solid performance from his team. He also didn't get too excited about it. It was job done and on to the next one - I quite like that.

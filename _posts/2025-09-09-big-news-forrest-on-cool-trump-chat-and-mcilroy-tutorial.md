Let's dive into the details: Grant Forrest is in the PGA Championship field at Wentworth this week

Grant Forrest says he did not get much of a word in during a "bonkers" and "cool" conversation with Donald Trump after his win at the NEXO Championship in Aberdeen last month.

The event was played at the Trump-owned course just north of the city and, after securing a four-stroke victory and his second win on the DP World Tour, the 32-year-old from West Lothian received a video call from the US President.

"It's been radio silence since the win," the 32-year-old laughed. "I didn't take him up on his offer to play the very next day.

"Bonkers, really. I suppose he's more speaking to me as the owner of the golf course in that situation, but he just happens to be the president of the United States. It was funny.

"I'll certainly not forget it. Not many people have been on FaceTime with the president.

"Obviously, everyone that congratulates you, that's the next thing they say. 'How was it speaking to Donald Trump?' I didn't really say much, to be honest. It was just off he went.

"It was really cool. Certainly at the beginning of that week, if you told me I was doing that on Sunday night, I wouldn't have believed you."

This week, Forrest is one of eight Scots in the field for the DP World Tour's flagship event, the PGA Championship at Wentworth.

He is also chasing one of the PGA Tour cards available to the top-10 players who have not already secured a place on the US circuit.

Forrest is currently in 39th position but knows, with some big events still to come in the final few weeks of the season, there are still plenty of rankings points up for grabs.

"Whether you're in 90th, you're trying to stay out of here next year or you're trying to get into Abu Dhabi or Dubai," he said.

"If you're 30th, you're looking to get up into the PGA Tour cards, so there's always something more. We just stick to our plan and keep chipping away at what we're doing and see where it leaves us.

"Obviously, I'd love to get one of the cards. I'd love to have a go at it out there, but for me, that's not the be-all and end-all. I'm just trying to keep improving every day and I think with that, it is a realistic possibility."

Forrest played part of the Wentworth course on Monday with Ludvig Aberg and Rory McIlroy, who arrived fresh from his Irish Open triumph.

"That was good to just measure up against two of the best at the moment," Forrest said of his practice holes.

"Especially Rory, the year and career he's had. He's been at the top for so long and to play with someone who's at that level, it's great just to pick their brains and see what they do.

"He's a phenomenal player so it's always good to see what they're doing.

"Rory hits the ball so well, so far, so straight. You can see why he wins so much.

"After we played, he was off to the gym. You put the work in, that's what you do. You keep putting in the effort and the results will come at some point."

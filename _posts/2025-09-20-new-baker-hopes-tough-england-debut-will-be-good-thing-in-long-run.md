Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sonny Baker has only played in seven first-class matches

Fast bowler Sonny Baker says his chastening England debut will hopefully make him a better player in the long run.

Baker was hit for 76 runs, including 14 boundaries, in a brutal seven-over introduction to international cricket as England were thrashed by South Africa in a one-day international at Headingley.

The 22-year-old is now hoping the weather relents to allow him to face Ireland in a T20 match in Dublin on Sunday.

He said: "From a figures point of view, it was obviously not exactly how I'd planned my debut going, but not all good experiences are enjoyable experiences.

"At the time I was thinking, '15 an over for my first three or four overs is not what I had in mind!' But in the long run, it'll be a good thing for me.

"Aiden Markram obviously fancied a piece and got a few away, but he's a very, very good player. 

"It's not the best I've ever bowled but looking back at my areas, there was a ball at 89mph, a little bit above top of leg stump, and he hit me over square leg for six. I was like 'OK, fair enough'. Batters are allowed to play good shots.

"So it's onwards and upwards, really. The next one will definitely be better than that - or hopefully it will!"

Baker would have got his second chance against Ireland on Friday had rain not washed out the second T20 in Malahide without a ball being bowled. 

He did not make the XI for the series opener but had been given the nod that he was back in before the weather intervened.

Now he is crossing his fingers that the skies and the selection goes his way in Sunday's final match.

"I'm desperate to get out there again. That's not how you want your first game to go but I've had a bit of time to reflect and bounced back fairly quick," he said.

"I'm just hoping Sunday is dry."

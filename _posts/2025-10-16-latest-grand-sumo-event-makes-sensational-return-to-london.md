According to new developments, Onosato (in blue) defeated Ura (in pink) with an 'overarm throw' in the last bout of day one of the Grand Sumo Tournament

Sumo wrestling has returned to London for the first time in over three decades, kicking off a five-day Grand Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

The highly anticipated return of Japan's iconic national sport has brought old and new fans alike to the same venue that hosted it in 1991.

Rikishi (sumo wrestlers) have been spotted posing for photos in front of Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, and even riding bikes around the city. 

Yokozuna Hoshoryu was among the wrestlers attracting attention at London landmarks

Hosts James Richardson and Hiro Morita welcomed people in the auditorium on Monday with an introduction to sumo's basic rules and rituals.

Centre stage is the dohyo, an elevated ring built over the last week by Japanese and local experts with carefully sourced soil and clay.

A Shinto ring-blessing ceremony preceded the tournament, and after a Yokozuna (the highest rank in sumo) rope-tying demonstration, the action of the Grand Sumo Tournament could really start.

There were huge cheers when some of the fan favourites, like 33-year-old Ura and 21-year-old Ukrainian sensation Aonishiki, walked onto the dohyo in their colourful kensho-mawashi, silk aprons worn during the entering ceremony.

The two Yokozuna Grand Champions, 25-year-old Onosato from Japan and 26-year-old Hoshoryu from Mongolia, each performed a Yokozuna ring-entering ceremony. The public, encouraged by host Morita, shouted "Yoisho!" as the wrestlers stomped the ground to 'repel evil spirits'.

The bouts started with a couple of spectacular tsuridashi (frontal lifts out) with rikishi picking up their opponents and moving them out of the ring. 

Some spirited bouts followed, often cheered loudly by the crowd, clearly not just made up of curious first-timers. Thousands of fans shouted their favourite rikishi's names, held banners and towels, and proudly wore sumo accessories. 

For many, this was a unique occasion to watch sumo live, and the atmosphere was one of high excitement and anticipation.

The first night of action ended with the two Yokozuna Grand Champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, defeating their opponents. A bow-twirling ceremony concluded day one, leaving fans in the auditorium and viewers at home captivated.

The Grand Sumo Tournament is live on BBC iPlayer, the Red Button and the BBC Sport website and app.

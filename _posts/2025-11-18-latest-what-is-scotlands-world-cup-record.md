According to new developments, Scotland's men have qualified for a World Cup for the first time since 1998 - and next year will mark their ninth appearance in the tournament.

The Scots have not fared well after qualifying previously, having never progressed past the group stages and won only four of 23 matches.

The 28-year gap between 1998 and 2026 is the longest they have been absent from men's World Cups.

Scotland have appeared at one Women's World Cup - playing in the 2019 edition in France, but failing to make it out of the group stage.

Scotland's men's side have not played at a World Cup since 1998

Scotland have previously qualified for 10 World Cups but only appeared at nine, having declined to appear at the 1950 tournament.

After finishing as runners-up in the British Home Championships, Scotland earned a place at the tournament in Brazil, but the Scottish Football Association declined its place on a matter of principle, having previously declared the nation would only attend as British champions.

Despite huge opposition from the players, the SFA held firm, meaning Scotland's first World Cup was the 1954 tournament in Switzerland.

Their most consistent run of qualifications came from 1974-1990, when they appeared at five in a row.

Their full list of qualifications is as follows:

Brazil 1950 - declined to appear

Switzerland 1954 - group stages

Sweden 1958 - group stages

West Germanny 1974 - group stages

Argentina 1978 - group stages 

Spain 1982 - group stages

Mexico 1986 - group stages

Italy 1990 - group stages

France 1998 - group stages

Canada/Mexico/United States - TBC

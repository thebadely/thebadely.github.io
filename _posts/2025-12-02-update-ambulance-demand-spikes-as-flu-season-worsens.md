Let's dive into the details: The number of 999 calls in London has risen over the past week, with London Ambulance Service (LAS) reporting its three busiest days of 2025 in a row. 

The service said the 20% increase included more calls from people with breathing difficulties due to viral infections and respiratory illnesses such as the flu. 

NHS figures indicate fewer than half of eligible people in London have had the free flu vaccine this season. 

Experts have predicted the worst flu season for a decade, fuelled by a new type of a flu virus. 

LAS strategic commander Laurence Cowderoy said the service had prepared for winter for many months, but still urged Londoners to "only call 999 in a life-threatening emergency".

He said the high call rate was "more typically seen on New Year's Eve".

Operations to cope with demands over the winter period include:

Karen Bonner, the regional chief nurse for London, said NHS staff had already seen the impact of the new flu strain with people coming into accident and emergency departments with symptoms. 

"We know it's a pretty bad flu this year – we know that from seeing it in Australia and other places - so, we really want to protect people," she said.

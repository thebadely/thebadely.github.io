Trump welcomed by crowd at Ryder Cup

US president Donald Trump arrived to watch the Ryder Cup amid a partisan atmosphere on day one at Bethpage Black.

Air Force One flew over the course just outside New York at approximately 11:00 local time (16:00 BST) and landed at a nearby airport.

Trump, an avid golfer and fan, arrived on the course 45 minutes later where he waved to the crowds, with some supporters chanting his name along with "U-S-A" while a number of others booed.

The president left shortly before 2:30pm local time (19:30 BST).

The high-security visit required the presence of about 500 law enforcement officers and ended with "no incidents", New York State Police told BBC Sport.

"Our goal was clearly to avoid any threats, but to achieve that by deterring any potential threat with our presence," Major Stephen Udice, the incident commander for the Ryder Cup, said.

The recent killing of American conservative activist Charlie Kirk has increased the risk of the Ryder Cup being targeted by someone wanting to "make a statement", Udice said earlier this week.

Security had been substantially increased for Trump's visit, with the US Secret Service, CIA and FBI joining the New York State Police in a cross-agency operation. 

SWAT teams - including snipers, bomb disposal units and canine units - joined police officers from several local Long Island forces.

Earlier this month the US Open men's tennis final was delayed by 30 minutes because of extra security measures put in place for a visit by the president.

At Bethpage Black, Trump stood behind what appeared to be a special type of protective plastic glass which had been assembled at the foot of a grandstand near the first tee.

With Europe 3-1 up on the USA following the foursomes a fan quipped Trump should have brought his clubs.

"I think we'll be ok," Trump told reporters as he disembarked Air Force One. "All great golfers." 

He was accompanied by his granddaughter Kai, who is a keen amateur golfer and is set to play at the University of Miami in 2026.

The 79-year-old was introduced to fans over the public address system and pumped his fists in acknowledgement before saluting during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner as military jets flew over.

Trump then walked from the security area and chatted animatedly with USA team member Bryson DeChambeau at the first tee box before hugging American captain Keegan Bradley.

He also shook hands with Europe skipper Luke Donald, who revealed Trump said to him: "'You know what, you're becoming a real great leader.' It was nice of him to say that."

Trump and DeChambeau have previously played golf together, with the 32-year-old two-time major winner supporting the Republican's campaign for the last election. 

DeChambeau said in the build-up to the Ryder Cup that he hoped the presence of Trump would "inspire" the United States to victory over Europe in the 45th edition of the event.

Europe are the current Ryder Cup holders following their victory in Rome in 2023 and are attempting to become to the first team to win away since they triumphed at Medinah in 2012.

According to new developments, Family and friends have paid moving tributes to Wales football legend Terry Yorath, with his son describing him as a "funny, kind, humble and proud man".

Around 100 mourners attended the funeral of the Cardiff-born midfielder, who died aged 75 earlier this month following a short illness.

The service, which included hymns from the Welsh choir Côr Meibion Taf, took place at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in Leeds, before a wake at Leeds United's Elland Road ground.

Yorath's son Jordan said the family were appreciative of the "truly heart-warming stories" shared by well-wishers.

He said his father "persevered through pain" following the death of Daniel, who collapsed and died suddenly when he was 15 from the genetic heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Yorath was also player-coach of Bradford in 1985 and was at Valley Parade when a fire killed 56 people. 

"Football was his lifeblood," said Jordan, noting that after the Bradford fire, Yorath attended the funerals of all those who died. 

Presenter and comedian Elis James delivered a eulogy, saying that Daniel's death "devastated the whole family and the whole community", coming seven years after the "horror" of Bradford. 

Yorath was "ravaged by grief" for the rest of his life, James said, adding that despite this "wherever he went he left people feeling better… he had time for everyone".

James added that the hope was that after Yorath's final breath, "what he heard was 'Hello Dad'". 

Speaking after the service, James said it was an "honour" to have read a eulogy to Yorath.

"His Wales team of the 80s and 90s is what made me fall in love with football," James told the BBC.

"He was part of every big moment in Welsh football between the 70s and the 90s, either as captain or manager.

"For me, he's on the Mount Rushmore of Welsh football."

Footballer-turned-pundit Chris Kamara described it as a "beautiful service". 

"Terry - what a marvellous career. He did everything and he suffered as well - the Bradford fire and his son Daniel. What a man," he said. 

Liverpool legend Ian Rush paid tribute to Yorath for the huge influence he had on his career. 

"He gave me all the confidence," Rush told BBC outside the church. 

"As a manager he always put players before himself and he was something special."

Rush said he would "never forget" the day in 1991 when he scored the winning goal when Wales beat Germany 1-0.

"It was with the help of Terry making me feel confident and that's something I'll never forget," he added.

Yorath's coffin was adorned with flowers in the blue, yellow and white colours of Leeds United, along with a floral arrangement in the shape of the Wales flag.

As the cortege entered the church, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau was sung and the first hymn was Cwm Rhondda.

His grandchildren, Paloma and Phoenix Yorath also led prayers.

Gabby Logan's son, Reuben Logan, read a poem before her daughter Lois Logan sang the hymn Jerusalem, at Yorath's request.

The service ended with Danny Boy, sung by Côr Meibion Taf, in what was described as a "poignant" tribute to Daniel.

The choir also sang You'll Never Walk Alone as the congregation left the church.

The family then on to a private burial service, with a wake to be held afterwards at Leeds' stadium, Elland Road.

James said Yorath "was fierce and proud to play for his country", captaining the team during the Euro 1976 campaign.

He was also instrumental in pushing for changing the anthem played before Wales games from God Save The Queen to Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, James said.

In his personal life, Yorath encouraged his children to play all sorts of sports, many of which they excelled at.

In his sermon, Father Dennis Cassidy said Yorath "lived life to the full in generosity". 

He paid tribute to his "warmth, kindness and sense of humour", adding that the family was "deeply moved by the very many messages that they have received".

"Those who are mourned are not forgotten," he added.

Several former Wales players who played under Yorath were among those filing out the church following the service.  

They included Ian Rush, Kevin Ratcliffe and Mickey Thomas, as well as representatives from the Football Association of Wales.

Former Leeds striker Noel Whelan and former Wolves player Don Goodman were also among the mourners at the service, along with sports commentator Bryn Law.

Yorath captained Wales in 42 of his 59 international appearances, and was part of the Leeds side that won the First Division in 1973-74 and lost in the 1975 European Cup final.

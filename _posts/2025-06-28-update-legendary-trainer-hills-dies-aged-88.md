According to new developments, Barry Hills was involved in horce racing for more than 70 years

Legendary racehorse trainer Barry Hills has died aged 88.

The Lambourn-based trainer enjoyed more than 3,200 wins during a career lasting over 40 years.

After a career as a jockey and head lad, he began training in 1969 and won 10 British and Irish Classics, including the 2,000 Guineas with Tap On Wood in 1979 and the 1,000 Guineas with Ghanaati 30 years later.

Hills racked up victories across the world, including the 1973 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Rheingold, and broke records with Nagwa and Further Flight.

Nagwa scored 13 wins as a juvenile and Further Flight landed five Jockey Club Cups.

Hills overcame serious illnesses and throat cancer to carry on training.

He retired in 2011 and handed over to his son Charlie, but came out of retirement for a period after the death of his son John.

Sons Michael and Richard were both successful jockeys.

A British Horseracing Authority statement read: "All of us at the BHA are saddened to learn of the death of Barry Hills and send our deepest condolences to his family and friends at this sad time.

"Barry's contribution to racing was immense and he will rightly be remembered as one of the great figures of our sport."

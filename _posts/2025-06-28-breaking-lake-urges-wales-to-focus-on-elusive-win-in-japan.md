Let's dive into the details: Hooker Dewi Lake made his Wales debut against Ireland in the 2022 Six Nations 

Wales captain Dewi Lake says his side need to ignore Welsh rugby's off-the-field  turmoil while they are in Japan as they look to end a 17-match losing international run.

Wales meet Eddie Jones' side in a two-match series, with the first Test in Kitakyushu on 5 July and the second in Kobe seven days later.

Wales are again being led by caretaker boss Matt Sherratt with a permanent head coach yet to be appointed to replace Warren Gatland, who left in February.

The domestic game in Wales is in limbo with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and two of its professional sides - Ospreys and Scarlets - again in dispute.

Talks are being held over the future of the domestic scene which could include cutting professional sides, decisions that can affect players' livelihoods.

The Wales players are used to such chaos and turmoil, with hooker Lake insisting their only focus can be trying to gain a first international win since October 2023.

"We've got a job to do on the back of a big losing run," said Lake.

"If we're thinking about all that is going on, we're not 100% focused on the rugby and we've got to be. So we're heads down and thinking about Japan.

"That's what we've all been speaking about. We know what we've got to do in the summer. 

"It's going to be a tough test. All focus is on the here and now. We've got to do that in Japan and set things right." 

Sherratt's backroom staff is currently just for this tour and includes Gethin Jenkins, Adam Jones, Danny Wilson, Rhys Thomas and Leigh Halfpenny.

New WRU performance director Dave Reddin is leading the search for Gatland's permanent successor, which has so far taken almost five months.

Lake says the players will not be concerned about that process in the next couple of weeks. 

"We know the job we've got to do with the task at hand, and that's not to think about what's down the line," said Lake

"If we don't do a job, we might not be here for the next round of coaches. 

"There's no point in worrying or dwelling on that. It's not our decision to make and we've got no say in the matter. 

"We can just focus on the rugby and the task at hand, which is to win a Test match."

Wales' wretched losing international run has seen them slip to a lowest position of 12th in the world rankings, just one place above this summer's opponents - who lost 53-20 to the Maori All Blacks on Saturday in their warm-up game before hosting Wales.

Lake believes this has increased the importance of the two-match series.

"It's massive," said Lake. "We're by no means underestimating the edge they're going to bring. 

"They're a dangerous side and caused a lot of upsets in recent memory. 

"They're 13th for a reason and we're 12th for a reason, so it's going to be a big battle.

"They're playing on home soil so I'm sure they'll take a lot of confidence in that."

Much has been made of the conditions awaiting Wales, with extreme heat and humidity expected for two mid-afternoon kick-offs.

Japan boss Jones has stated he wants his side to run Wales off their feet, which is a tactic Lake says he will not be shocked at.

"We know the style of rugby they like to play," said Lake 

"We know they play with very quick ball. It's our job to slow it down as they'll want to play with speed. 

"That'll stress our defence, but that's our job to slow it down, put a stop to them and make sure we can be the dominant team out there. But we understand what they're going to bring."

Wales' preparation has included gruelling heat-chamber sessions at their training base in the Vale of Glamorgan.

"We've heard rumours it's going to be another level," said Lake.

"We've done our heat work and trained hard to replicate the weather here. 

"Sometimes you can overthink these things and a bit of doubt creeps in, you start to worry. We're just focused on getting on the field."

Lake rekindles the Wales captaincy role he adopted during the 2024 summer tour of Australia and the autumn internationals.

He has been asked to lead the squad again after his good friend Jac Morgan was one of only two Welshmen picked for the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, alongside scrum-half Tomos Williams.

"I was just proud of him and happy for him," said Lake. "We came through together and have done a lot together. 

"To see his name read out was amazing. I was on the flight in South Africa with him at the time when he found out and we all expressed how happy and proud we all were."

Lake's own Lions ambitions were hampered by an injury-affected Six Nations in which he missed the start of the tournament because of a bicep injury.

After being absent for the first three games, Lake was reduced to replacement appearances against Scotland and England.

His latest setback continues a series of niggling injuries that has limited the Ospreys hooker to just 20 caps so far.

"It's tough, but things happen for a reason I guess," said Lake. "But I'm feeling good and my body's feeling good."

There are six uncapped players in the 33-man squad in Japan and Wales have benefitted from having a month together.

"We've trained well and hard," said Lake. "It's kind of a new group so a lot of time has gone into just building relationships. 

"Having a certain understanding of each other and how they work has been important."

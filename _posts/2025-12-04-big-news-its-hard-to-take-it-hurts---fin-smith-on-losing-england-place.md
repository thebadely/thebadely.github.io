According to new developments, Smith made his England debut against Italy in the 2024 Six Nations and has won 13 caps in total for his country

Northampton fly-half Fin Smith says he has struggled to deal with dropping down England's pecking order this autumn.

Smith, 23, made his first England start in February's 26-25 win over France, and retained the 10 shirt for the Six Nations victories over Scotland, Italy and Wales.

However, after Smith toured with the British and Irish Lions this summer, George Ford was picked ahead of him for three of England's four autumn internationals, with Marcus Smith's versatility often preferred on the bench.

"It was a tough few weeks mentally," Smith told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show of the autumn.

"You go in with such high expectations, having done well in the Six Nations and gone on the Lions tour, and then getting your head around a few of the selection things - it does sting.

"It is hard to take. I have absolutely loved how good it feels to wear the England 10 shirt; having that taken away from you does hurt."

England assistant coach Kevin Sinfield admitted during the autumn that it was impossible to keep all three of England's fly-halves happy, conceding "there is always someone who is a little disgruntled, who has maybe has a little bit of frustration".

Smith says the communication with the coaching staff is regular and honest.

"[Head coach] Steve [Borthwick] always has a meeting with you to tell you where you are at with selection and why he has gone with what he has," he said.

"I always have my side of things and put my opinion forward, but he is ultimately the one that picks the team.

"It is not that I have played badly, it is just that sometimes in sport people get an opportunity and take it - George absolutely did that, particularly in that All Blacks game.

"It was tough for me to go in and ask why I am not the one getting picked after that. I still absolutely believe in myself so I just have to keep at it."

Smith was frustrated with his performances on the Lions tour of Australia.

He started the pre-tour match against Argentina in Dublin, but failed to apply pressure on first-choice 10 Finn Russell, with Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell preferred on the bench during the Test series.

However, he relished being part of an institution that his maternal grandfather Tom Elliot toured South Africa with in 1955, and mixing with players he is usually playing against.

Twelve Leinster players were part of the initial 38-strong Lions squad.

Northampton, who had beaten Leinster in the Champions Cup semi-finals five days before the squad announcement, provided four in Smith, Tommy Freeman, Henry Pollock and Alex Mitchell.

"As a life experience it was amazing in terms of the some of the memories I made and the people I met," added Smith.

"It was just a great group of people

"I thought [Leinster second row and fellow Lion] James Ryan was going to be very different to me. Playing against him he is a bit nasty, but he is an [Northampton and England second row] Alex Coles prototype - both very intelligent, very dry sense of humour, very funny. I got on with him very well.

"We didn't mention [Northampton's win over Leinster] very much but our coach Richard Wigglesworth kept bringing it up. He thought it was hilarious. I didn't mind too much being reminded."

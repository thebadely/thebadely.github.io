How Le Fee inspired Sunderland's comeback win over Bournemouth

Sunderland can't be toppled at home this season.

The last newly-promoted side to start a Premier League season unbeaten through their first seven home games was Blackburn Rovers a whopping 24 years ago in 2001-02.

The Black Cats have matched them, surviving a visit from leaders Arsenal and on Saturday coming from two goals down against Bournemouth to record a frantic 3-2 win.

Sunderland's form at Stadium of Light has propelled them up to fourth in the league table.

Only Arsenal, Brighton, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace can also boast an unbeaten home record in this season's English top flight.

Manager Regis Le Bris is refusing to get carried away, saying "our first target is we want to reach 40 points" after his side's win over Bournemouth.

But ex-Black Cats midfielder Lee Cattermole believes his former side "are riding a wave" and can use their momentum to continue their charge up the table.

Sunderland, who lost at home on penalties to Huddersfield in the EFL Cup, have not been beaten in the Premier League at Stadium of Light 

Sunderland are the best promoted side we've seen at this stage of a Premier League season for 20 years, since Wigan in 2005-06 (Sunderland were also a promoted side that season but had just five points after 13 games).

Only five promoted sides have ever had more points after 13 games.

Sunderland fans aren't quite partying like it's 1999 - Peter Reid's Black Cats had 27 points at this stage thanks to Kevin Phillips' 13 goals in 13 games.

Five of the previous seven promoted sides that had 20+ points after 13 games finished in the top half - although Hull finished 17th in 2008-09.

Sunderland had a disastrous start at home against Bournemouth on Saturday. 

Amine Adli put the visitors in front after seven minutes and Tyler Adams doubled their lead eight minutes later with a stunning strike from inside the centre circle.

The hosts were gifted a way back into the game when Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott was adjudged to have taken out Reinildo from behind - with Enzo Le Fee burying the resulting penalty kick.

Seconds after the restart, Sunderland levelled with Bertrand Traore's low driven strike catching Bournemouth keeper Djordje Petrovic at his near post.

And the turnaround was completed in the 69th minute through substitute Brian Brobbey who headed in Le Fee's corner.

"The team and the crowd believed and it was some turnaround in the end," Sunderland defender Dan Ballard told BBC Match of the Day. 

"They believed when we got that first goal and they pushed us through. When we're hanging on to a lead, they're pushing us over the line."

Manager Le Bris added on BBC Match of the Day: "I think here we have a great energy in the stands, so if we give a lot on the pitch, they will react. 

"We created this atmosphere and we deserved to win in the end"

Sunderland's home record is so strong they have already collected more points at Stadium of Light this campaign (15) than they did in the whole of their last campaign in the top flight (14 points in 2016-17).

They also won a Premier League game having been two goals down for the very first time at their 188th attempt.

"Sunderland are riding a wave right now. Momentum-wise in the season, they're getting through tough moments, the belief is there as a team," former captain Lee Cattermole told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"You can feel it in the stadium, the connection is there with the players and supporters. The fans are right behind them.

"It's fabulous to see, the manager deserves huge credit. Everyone in this stadium knew how big this game was. To go from being 2-0 down to win the game 3-2 shows what this place is all about."

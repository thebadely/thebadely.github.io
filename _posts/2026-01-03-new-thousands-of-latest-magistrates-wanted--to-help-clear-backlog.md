Here’s what you need to know: The government has launched a recruitment drive for thousands of new magistrates  to volunteer in England and Wales as part of its efforts to grapple with the crown court backlog.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said more than 2,000 magistrates have been trained since 2022 and the latest call aims to boost that number by another 2,000 within the next financial year.

Justice Secretary David Lammy said magistrates served "a vital role" in the court system and "we need more people of every age and background to volunteer".

In December, Lammy announced sweeping reforms to the criminal courts, including removing juries from a number of trials in England and Wales to speed up the justice process.

Latest figures showed more than 79,600 criminal cases were caught in the courts backlog in England and Wales - a record high since early 2023 and is projected to hit 100,000 by 2028, according to the MoJ.

The delays mean that for some serious crimes charged in 2026, victims and suspects could be left waiting years for justice as they are unlikely to see the case come to trial before 2030.

Lammy praised magistrates as "everyday heroes" who hear thousands of cases across every jurisdiction.

"Volunteering to become a magistrate can make a real difference to your life and the lives of others - that's why I'm calling on the public to apply and play your part," he added.

The Magistrates' Association described the push as a "big vote of confidence" in magistrates, but called for more resources for the courts, including trained legal advisers and repairs for crumbling court buildings.

Shadow justice minister Kieran Mullan said while the recruitment drive was welcome, the move "cannot paper over the failings of a justice secretary and Labour government that has consistently failed to deliver meaningful reform".

All magistrates are expected to volunteer at least 13 days a year to hear cases.

Magistrates are wanted across criminal, youth, and civil and family proceedings, and have specialist legal advisers to support them to deal with a range of cases.

Latest figures show 57% of magistrates are female and 14% come from an ethnic minority background, with London having the highest proportion of 31%, according to the MoJ.

Wiegman awarded Coach of the Year

England women's manager Sarina Wiegman has been named the BBC Sports Personality Coach of the Year for a second time.

The Dutchwoman guided England to their second straight European Championship title with victory over Spain in the Euro 2025 final. 

The victory meant the Lionesses became the first England team - women's or men's - to win a major trophy on foreign soil. 

Wiegman, 56, became the first woman to claim the Coach of the Year award in 2022, while this year's victory means she is the first woman to win the award on multiple occasions.

"It's an absolute honour to be here again," Wiegman said.

"This award is for the players and staff. I have been part of a tremendous team, an incredible group of players and staff."

Wiegman replaced Phil Neville as England manager in September 2021, guiding the Lionesses to their first piece of major silverware at Euro 2022 when they beat Germany 2-1 in the final at Wembley. 

England then reached the World Cup final in Australia in 2023, only to lose 1-0 to Spain. 

At this year's Euros, England showed incredible battling qualities to remain in the tournament and became the only country in the competition's history to have three different matches go to extra time.

By reaching the final Wiegman became the first women's or men's manager to reach five consecutive major international finals after leading the Netherlands to the Euro 2017 title and 2019 World Cup showpiece. 

The Lionesses beat Spain 3-1 on penalties after the final finished 1-1 after extra time in Switzerland, with Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton saving two of Spain's efforts in the shootout.

The victory meant Wiegman became just the second manager after Germany's Christina Theune to win three successive European Championships.

"What made an absolute difference is that we were the best-bonded team - and we were so together. The togetherness in this team was so special and it was incredible to be a part of," Wiegman said.

"Finally, I would like to say that every coach - especially every female coach - enjoy yourself, have fun. You can absolutely make a difference."

England's success led to Wiegman being named women's coach of the year at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards, while she also won the women's coach prize at the Fifa Best Awards for a record fifth time.

Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows shared the BBC Sports Personality Coach of the Year award in 2024 after guiding Keely Hodgkinson to 800m Olympic gold at the Paris Games. 

Sir Alex Ferguson won the inaugural Coach of the Year award in 1999, the year Manchester United won the Treble.

Previous winners include Sir Clive Woodward, Colin Montgomerie and Claudio Ranieri. 

Wiegman joins Arsene Wenger, Sir Dave Brailsford and Sir Gareth Southgate in winning the award more than once.

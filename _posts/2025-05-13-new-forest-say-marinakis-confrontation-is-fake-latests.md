How Marinakis and Nuno situation unfolded

Nottingham Forest have denied that owner Evangelos Marinakis' exchange with manager Nuno Espirito Santo on the pitch on Sunday was a "confrontation".

And the East Midlands club described subsequent reaction to the situation as "fake news".

An animated Marinakis spoke to Nuno after Sunday's 2-2 Premier League draw with Leicester.

Forest said the incident was because of Marinakis' frustration that striker Taiwo Awoniyi had continued to play after an 88th-minute injury which subsequently required 'urgent' surgery on Monday night.

The club added Marinakis' actions were because of his "deep care, responsibility, and emotional investment," in the player and the club.

"The truth of the matter is there was no confrontation, with Nuno or with others, either on the pitch or inside the stadium," the club added.

"There was only shared frustration between all of us that the medical team should never have allowed the player to continue.

"We urge former coaches and players, and other public figures in the game, to resist the urge to rush to judgement and fake news online, especially when they do not have the full facts and context."

Awoniyi has 'urgent' surgery after abdominal injury

Forest said Awoniyi is "recovering well" after surgery on an abdominal injury.

The Nigeria international, 27, collided with the post in the 88th minute of the draw at the City Ground as he attempted to get on the end of a cross from Anthony Elanga.

He received treatment on the pitch and continued playing, with Forest having used their three substitution windows, but was visibly struggling when the match restarted.

Forest said Marinakis' decision to go on to the pitch was "instinctive" and "human", showing "just how much this team and its people mean to him".

"To Evangelos Marinakis, this isn't just a football club - it's family - and he instils that message in all of us," Forest said.

"In moments like that he demonstrates his leadership, not just through words, but through action and presence. 

"In the final 10 minutes of the game, when he saw our player clearly in discomfort, struggling through visible pain, it became increasingly difficult for him to stay on the sidelines."

Speaking on Sky Sports following the match, former Manchester United captain Gary Neville described Marinakis' actions as an "absolute joke" and "scandalous".

Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said on BBC Sport's Match Of The Day 2 it was "not a great look" for Marinakis.

However, speaking on 5 Live's Monday Night Club, Chris Sutton said: "I was at the match. I think there was a real overreaction in the way people viewed this. 

"It was because of a misunderstanding between the medical team over Awoniyi. The anger came because Marinakis cared - this wasn't aimed at Nuno."

In their statement on Tuesday, Forest called some of the coverage of the incident "baseless and ill-informed outrage" for the "purposes of personal social media traction".

The club added: "At Nottingham Forest, we believe the mental and physical well-being of our players and coaching staff must always take precedence - over media narratives, inflammatory judgements, and certainly over self-promotion.

"We call on these influential voices to show the same respect for player welfare that they often demand from others. Let concern come before commentary."

"Nottingham Forest can confirm that Taiwo Awoniyi is recovering well so far following urgent surgery on a serious abdominal injury sustained during Sunday's match against Leicester City.

"The seriousness of his injury is a powerful reminder of the physical risks in the game, and why a player's health and well-being must always come first. At Nottingham Forest, this principle is not just policy for us; it is the deeply held belief and conviction of our owner. To Evangelos Marinakis, this isn't just a football club - it's family - and he instils that message in all of us.

"That is why he was so personally and emotionally invested in the situation that unfolded at the City Ground on Sunday. His reaction was one of deep care, responsibility, and emotional investment in one of our own. He didn't just see it as an isolated incident, but as something that reflected the values and unity of the entire team.

"In moments like that he demonstrates his leadership, not just through words, but through action and presence. In the final ten minutes of the game, when he saw our player clearly in discomfort, struggling through visible pain, it became increasingly difficult for him to stay on the sidelines. His deep frustration at seeing our player lying on the ground in severe pain - something no one with genuine care could ignore - triggered him to go onto the pitch. It was instinctive, human, and a reflection of just how much this team and its people mean to him. He would do the same again if such an unfortunate event were ever to reoccur.

"The truth of the matter is there was no confrontation, with Nuno or with others, either on the pitch or inside the stadium. There was only shared frustration between all of us that the medical team should never have allowed the player to continue.

"In light of this, we urge former coaches and players, and other public figures in the game, to resist the urge to rush to judgement and fake news online, especially when they do not have the full facts and context. Baseless and ill-informed outrage for the purposes of personal social media traction serves no one - least of all the injured player. We call on these influential voices to show the same respect for player welfare that they often demand from others. Let concern come before commentary.

"At Nottingham Forest, we believe the mental and physical well-being of our players and coaching staff must always take precedence - over media narratives, inflammatory judgements, and certainly over self-promotion. In moments like these, the game must unite around those who put their bodies and minds on the line every week. That's what real leadership looks like in our game."

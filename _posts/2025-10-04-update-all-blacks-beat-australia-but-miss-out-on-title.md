Experts revealed that New Zealand won three consecutive Rugby Championship titles between 2021 and 2023 before losing out to South Africa last year

Australia 14 (9) 

Tries: Ikitau Pens: Edmed 3

New Zealand 28 (17)

Tries: Carter, Tupaea 2, Bower Cons: McKenzie Pens: McKenzie 2

New Zealand beat Australia in Perth but missed out on the Rugby Championship title to South Africa, who defended their crown with victory over Argentina.

A Quinn Tupaea double helped the All Blacks claim a bonus-point 28-14 win in Saturday's early game to move four points clear of Springboks in the table.

However, world champions South Africa beat Argentina 29-27 at Twickenham to clinch back-to-back Rugby Championship titles for the first time.

Tupaea, who replaced the dropped Billy Proctor, swung the game in New Zealand's favour with two quickfire tries late in the first half. 

Leroy Carter crossed in the eighth minute to give the visitors an early lead, but Australia responded with three penalties from the boot of Tane Edmed. 

Tupaea's two tries, in the 30th and 36th minutes, handed the All Blacks a 17-9 lead at half-time. 

Australia's Len Ikitau pulled a try back for the hosts midway through the second half, either side of penalties from New Zealand's Damian McKenzie. 

But George Bower came off the bench to barge over seconds after the final hooter sounded to seal the win for New Zealand and hand them the attacking bonus point. 

Defeat for Australia marked the end of former captain James Slipper's storied international career. 

The 36-year-old is the Wallabies' most-capped player, making 151 appearances.

He represented Australia in four World Cups and captained the side on 15 occasions.

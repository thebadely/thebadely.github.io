Here’s what you need to know: At least 14 migrants have died after a speedboat carrying them collided with a Hellenic Coast Guard vessel off the coast of the island of Chios late on Tuesday.

Greek authorities said the speedboat was making dangerous manoeuvres and that a pursuit was under way at the time of the collision in the Chios Strait, near the village of Vrontades.

Twenty four people were rescued, some of whom were seriously injured, and others are reportedly still missing. 

The coastguard has not yet clarified the exact circumstances around the collision. 

A search and rescue operation was ongoing on Tuesday night, which involved four coastguard vessels, a privately owned boat carrying civilian divers, and a helicopter.

Greek state broadcaster ERT said the injured included seven children, a pregnant woman and two coastguard officers.

Four deaths were initially reported but an update issued at 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) said ten additional bodies had been recovered, bringing the confirmed death toll to 14.

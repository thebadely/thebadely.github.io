Experts revealed that A nine-month-old baby has been killed in a dog attack in south-east Wales, according to Gwent Police.

Officers and paramedics went to a property on Crossway in Rogiet, Monmouthshire, at about 18:00 GMT on Sunday.

The dog was seized and removed from the address, the force said. 

Police were working to establish the breed of the animal and no arrests had been made.

Ch Supt John Davies said: "Officers are on scene and will be making further inquiries as the investigation progresses."

Residents said they were in disbelief at the death of the child, with the community in shock and trying to come to terms with what had happened. 

They said they saw police cars and ambulances on the quiet residential street in south Wales at the time of the incident. 

By 22:00 the police cordon had been lifted and all the ambulances and most police cars had gone, replaced by scenes of crime investigation vehicles.

At this time two police officers were still guarding a house on Crossway, a street now silent but for the hum of cars on the M4 and trains on the south Wales to London line.

It has been recently reported that Luke Littler is second in the PDC Order of Merit

Luke Littler's hunt to become world number one continues after he was knocked out of the European Championship in a thrilling 10-7 second-round defeat by James Wade. 

Luke Humphries, meanwhile, narrowly avoided a shock as he came from behind before winning a deciding leg to beat Cameron Menzies 10-9.

The tournament's winner will be decided on Sunday, with the four quarter-finals taking place in the afternoon session before the semis and final in the evening.

Littler, 18, could potentially have snatched top spot of the PDC Order of Merit from fellow Englishman Humphries at the tournament in Dortmund and would definitely have done so had he won the title. 

But in a tight last-16 encounter, Wade went 2-0 up before Littler pulled it back to 3-2.

Wade went two legs up again to make it 6-4 but Littler responded again, drawing the game at 6-6.

After exchanging legs once more it was Wade who pulled ahead, making the most of Littler failing to check out double 10 to make it 8-7, then finishing on 73 before an expert finish on 108 to seal victory.

Wade, who peaked at world number two in 2010 and is an 11-time PDC major winner, told ITV that he did not think Littler "played very well" compared to his usual standard.

"I think I should have run away with it a little more before I did," said Wade. 

"I think everyone in darts knows I can play."

While Littler and Wade both averaged 97.75 - and Littler managed eight 180s to Wade's three - throwing 11 more 100+ scores and having a checkout rate of 45.45% to Littler's 33.33% proved the difference.

Littler has not fared well recently in Germany, where he has skipped some tournaments after facing a hostile reception from spectators. 

He was booed alongside Humphries when the pair lost to Germany at the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in June.

After the European Championship there are two big tournaments before the World Championship starts on 11 December - the Grand Slam of Darts (8-16 November) and Players Championship Finals (21-23 November).

Humphries found himself 5-7 and 5-8 behind against Scotland's Menzies, but he won three straight legs to go 9-8 up and made held his throw after Menzies took it to a decider.

Humphries had a lower checkout rate, but a higher average and more 100+ and 140+ throws helped him edge past Menzies.

The world number one's win means he will face compatriot Wade in the last eight.

Humphries said he "really had to work hard" to get past Menzies. 

"I'm proud of the way I held myself in moments where I felt very frustrated," he said. "I was trying to hold myself together. I did and the way I've come back - I'm quite proud of that. 

"When you're winning in games where you're under the cosh, it's quite pleasing."

Let's dive into the details: Since losing 6-0 6-3 to Boisson, Dart has won just one of her past seven matches and slipped outside of the top 100

Harriet Dart says the negative reaction she received for aiming a personal jibe at opponent Lois Boisson has taken a toll on her.

During a 6-0 6-3 first-round defeat to Boisson at the Rouen Open in April, Dart asked the umpire to tell her opponent to put on deodorant, saying: "She smells really bad."

The 28-year-old from West Hampstead later apologised on Instagram, calling it a "heat-of-the-moment comment that I truly regret".

Boisson made light of the incident at the time, posting an edited photo of her holding some deodorant and telling toiletries company Dove that they "apparently need a collab".

Their careers have since gone in significantly directions, with Boisson making a major Grand Slam breakthrough at the French Open and Dart winning just one of seven matches.

Dart, who will face Hungary's Dalma Galfi in the first round of Wimbledon on Monday, was asked about the comment by reporters at the All England Club on Saturday.

"I'd be lying if [I said] it didn't affect me a little bit," said the British number four, who sits 124th in the world rankings.

"I'm human, but also we all make mistakes and I just tried to look forward.

"I've gone through some difficulties these weeks. I don't always share what I go through but I'm just looking forward and preparing the best I can.

"I don't know why we're still talking about this. It's been months now. I feel like I answered a lot of the questions that were asked of me and that's it. I really just want to put it behind me."

Dart has been given a wildcard entry into Wimbledon - unlike Boisson, who reached the Roland Garros semi-finals in June by beating three seeded players.

After she missed out on a discretionary place, world number 65 Boisson lost in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying to Canada's Carson Branstine on Tuesday.

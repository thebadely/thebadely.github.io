It has been recently reported that Jamie Vardy scored 200 goals for Leicester City and helped them win the Premier League and FA Cup

Former Leicester City and England striker Jamie Vardy has completed a move to Italian Serie A club Cremonese on a free transfer.

The 38-year-old has signed a one-year contract with a further year on offer should the newly-promoted club avoid relegation.

Vardy, who joined Leicester in 2012, has been without a club since his contract at the King Power Stadium expired in June.

He is considered among Leicester's greatest ever players having led the line in their Premier League title-winning 2015-16 season.

Vardy scored 200 goals in 500 games for the club and won the FA Cup in 2021, while he also scored seven goals in 26 England appearances.

Cremonese have won both of their opening Serie A matches, against Sassuolo and AC Milan, having returned to the Italian top flight this summer.

Vardy could make his Cremonese debut on Monday, 15 September, away at Hellas Verona.

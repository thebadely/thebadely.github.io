Experts revealed that Mathys Tel scored three goals in 20 appearances for Spurs last season

Tottenham forward Mathys Tel says the online racist abuse he received after the club's recent defeat in the Uefa Super Cup will not "bring him down".

The 20-year-old Frenchman was the target of abusive messages on social media after Spurs lost the match 4-3 on penalties after letting a two-goal lead slip in normal time.

Tel came on as a substitute in the 79th minute and was one of two Spurs players who failed to convert from the spot in the penalty shootout.

Spurs said they were "disgusted" by the abuse and those who sent the messages to Tel, who joined the north London club from Bayern Munich permanently in the summer, were "nothing but cowards".

Speaking for the first time since the incident in a post on his Instagram account, external Tel said he wanted to say "thank you" for all the "messages of support" he had received.

"I was also disappointed about Wednesday night but racism has no place in our society. Every day is a learning curve, and every day is a lesson," Tel said.

"I know where I come from, where I started and none of this will bring me down. With work and humility, respect reigns."

Tel's comments come in the wake of racist abuse suffered by Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo in their opening match of the Premier League season against Liverpool at Anfield.

Last Friday's game with the current champions was briefly halted in the 29th minute after Semenyo flagged it up to the referee.

A 47-year-old man from Liverpool, who was arrested by Merseyside Police on Saturday on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, has been conditionally bailed.

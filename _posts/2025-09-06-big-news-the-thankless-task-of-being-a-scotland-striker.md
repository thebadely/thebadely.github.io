Who'd be a Scotland striker?

Even after Steve Clarke's side picked up a potentially priceless away point against Group C top seeds Denmark, the front two of Che Adams and Lyndon Dykes still came in for plenty of stick from supporters.

They don't score enough. They don't run enough. They don't do enough.

Those were just some of the pelters the pair received following the first of six World Cup qualifiers. But the determined duo worked tirelessly, disrupted the Danish defence and hauled the Scots up the field in Copenhagen.

A man who knows exactly what that - and the criticism - is like, is former Scotland striker and BBC Sport Scotland presenter and pundit Steven Thompson.

"The job they needed to do for the team, they did," Thompson told the BBC. "Their work-rate was phenomenal, they put in a power of work and created chances.

"Steve Clarke will be really happy with that. They do a lot."

What did we learn from Scotland's draw in Denmark?

Of the players selected to start in Copenhagen by Clarke, his strikers were ranked the lowest by the BBC Sport audience, as the above graphic shows. Only substitutes scored lower marks out of 10.

When asked about his unusual deployment of the duo, Clarke said; "If I am not brave, I might as well not be in the job."

Fortune favours the brave, and in this case, the Scotland head coach was the winner.

Adams has come off the bench in Torino's opening two Serie A games, while Dykes - who was linked with a deadline-day move to Hibernian - has played a scant 23 Championship minutes in Birmingham City's first four games.

At times that rust was evident, but their exuberance couldn't be questioned.

Dykes in particular was a menace. It was a throwback to his best days in a dark blue jersey where, full of commitment, he challenged for every long ball, gave his team-mates a target, and preoccupied the Danish defence.

It appears the bulk of that work goes unnoticed when a striker isn't scoring.

Dykes hasn't netted an international goal since he started the famous comeback against Norway in Oslo over two years ago.

Adams' hat-trick against Liechtenstein in June, meanwhile, gave him his first Scotland goals in just over a year after scoring against Gibraltar before the Euros.

"Strikers, ultimately, are always judged on their goals," Thompson said. "It's not easy but you know your job for the team.

"They need service, which there wasn't a lot of, but what I saw as someone who has been there - and what Clarke will have seen - is their work-rate and what they do outwith scoring goals. And it's quite a lot.

"I thought they did more than well enough in the game, particularly Dykes.

"They pressed well and didn't allow the Denmark defenders to have an easy night. They were physical and put themselves about."

Adams won two of his six aerial duels, to Dykes' seven from 11. Seven of Adams' 10 passes found a team-mate, while Dykes completed eight of his 16.

The Torino striker didn't have a shot at goal, though he came agonisingly close to latching on to a teasing Ryan Christie cross, while Dykes had two attempts, one which should have broken the deadlock.

He was slipped through by his partner up front but inexplicably delayed, allowing Danish defender Rasmus Kristensen to scramble back and block the shot.

"Che puts it through the defender's legs and my first thought is to take a good touch and have a shot," Dykes said later, reflecting on the moment.

"There was as a defender so close to me, I take the touch, and it's a little wider than I wanted, but I take the shot and he blocks it. On another day, maybe it goes under his legs and goes in that bottom corner.

"Looking back, maybe I could hit it first time, but it's going so quickly in the game."

Notably, that question is plural.

If Clarke is to persist with his two-up-top approach, a goal or two wouldn't go amiss against pot four side Belarus on Monday - a game live on the BBC.

Many will acknowledge it's a different test, which perhaps calls for a different set-up and potentially different individuals after the exertions in Copenhagen.

Amid the annoyance at Clarke's ultimately spot-on starting XI on Friday, many fans were hopeful Hibernian's in-form forward Kieron Bowie would get the nod.

The 22-year-old has had a super start to the season, with two goals in three Scottish Premiership games and a goal of the season contender against Partizan in Conference League qualifying.

Thompson, who believes Bowie is the "most all-round striker" of the three, would like to see the Easter Road forward from the off in Hungary on Monday.

"He's got the goals," said Thompson, "he's got the physicality and he's got the link-up, but his work-rate is phenomenal as well."

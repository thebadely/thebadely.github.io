Let's dive into the details: Liverpool were English champions for the 20th time

Liverpool: 1st

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 3rd

Worthy winners of a 20th title. Liverpool dominated the Premier League from an early stage and never looked like slipping up as they moved relentlessly while others faltered. A brilliant first season for head coach Arne Slot, who made what many regarded as the impossible task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp look so much easier than it was.

Mohamed Salah was the inspiration, but this Liverpool team had strength, quality and consistency in all areas. They can now add power from the ultimate position of strength, with Bayer Leverkusen's brilliant Florian Wirtz potentially on the way in a Â£125m British record deal.

What McNulty said in August: "While there is understandable anxiety from supporters about the lack of signings, this remains an exceptionally strong Liverpool squad. They will challenge for trophies and finish in the top four."

Arsenal: 2nd

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 2nd

This was ultimately a disappointing season for Arsenal, despite finishing second in the Premier League and reaching the semi-final of the Champions League. They deal in trophies - but manager Mikel Arteta has now gone five years without one. He has to deliver next season.

They had too many draws in the league. And while injuries hit hard, Arsenal paid the price for not addressing a major flaw last summer by signing a striker. They must do it now.

What McNulty said in August: "Arsenal must surely be in the market for a proven goalscorer before the close of the transfer window, a component still lacking for all last season's excellence."

Manchester City: 3rd

McNulty's pre-season prediction: Champions

A desperately disappointing season by their own standards, never threatening to win a fifth successive Premier League title. Losing to Real Madrid in the Champions League play-off stage, then Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final, provided further lows.

Pep Guardiola's suggestion that the Community Shield equalled success made a very hollow sound. This was, that meaningless bauble aside, a season of relative failure.

This will have hurt Manchester City, despite reaching the Champions League once again - so expect a serious response from a wounded club.

What McNulty said in August: "Think about backing against them. Then think again. There will be a season when Manchester City do not win the Premier League - I'm just not sure this will be it."

Chelsea: 4th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 7th

Enzo Maresca was keen to turn on his and Chelsea's critics, and he deserves credit for taking them back into the Champions League on the final day of the season while looking forward to a Europa Conference League final against Real Betis.

It was still a strange season, however, and many Chelsea fans remain to be convinced by Maresca's studied passing style, even if the owners are.

Chelsea looked title outsiders around October but a dip in form - especially for the brilliant Cole Palmer - ended that talk. But it was a decent return for this season with the possibility of a trophy.

Summer priorities? A better goalkeeper than Robert Sanchez and a reliable goalscorer.

What McNulty said in August: "Impossible to predict what will happen in the next 20 minutes at Chelsea, let alone what might have happened by the time May rolls around."

Premier League predictions: How accurate were BBC Sport pundits?

Which Premier League sides have qualified for Europe?

Newcastle United: 5th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 9th

A brilliant season from manager Eddie Howe and his team. The Toon Army celebrated their first domestic trophy for 70 years - and first silverware for 55 years - with the deserved Carabao Cup win against Liverpool at Wembley and now they are back in the Champions League.

St James' Park was in a cold sweat on the final day as Newcastle lost to Everton, but the party started after Manchester United's controversial win against Aston Villa.

This will surely mean key duo Alexander Isak and Bruno Guimaraes have no need to eye pastures new and will form the bedrock for further progress next season.

What McNulty said in August: "Top 10 but still some uncertainty at Newcastle United."

Aston Villa: 6th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 4th

Aston Villa's fine season ended in the controversy and acrimony of defeat at Manchester United and that disallowed effort from Morgan Rogers, ending their hopes of a second successive season in the Champions League, where they reached the quarter-final this term.

Unai Emery still produces work that should be the envy of clubs such as Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. He will continue to demand progress under Villa's ambitious owners.

There was certainly a tinge of disappointment in Villa's conclusion, with the mystifying "no show" in the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley a big blot, then that final day defeat, but Emery has transformed Villa and, with outstanding youngsters such as Rogers, there is still much to be satisfied about.

What McNulty said in August: "Champions League football will put an additional strain on Emery's squad but I fancy top four again."

Nottingham Forest: 7th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 16th

The fact there was even the mere talk of disappointment at missing out on the Champions League illustrates what a superb season Nottingham Forest have had under Nuno Espirito Santo.

Yes, a strong position was wasted, but if you had offered any Forest fan solid safety at the start of the season, let alone European football, they would have signed up instantly.

Striker Chris Wood had the season of his life, while the coveted Morgan Gibbs-White was outstanding. Goalkeeper Matz Sels was top class, and defensive duo Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic provided the bedrock.

Owner Evangelos Marinakis never hides his ambition, so expect more big moves in readiness for Europe.

What McNulty said in August:  "If Forest keep this squad together (and they are always looking to add), then I see them staying up."

Brighton and Hove Albion: 8th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 12th

A solid season with plenty of promise under 32-year-old head coach Fabian Hurzeler, with hopes of Europe maintained until the final day, when they won 4-1 at Tottenham Hotspur, but ultimately missed out.

Brighton's continue to be enterprising and easy on the eye with their intense style, and this campaign was another example of how far this well-run club has come.

There is usually transfer activity at Amex Stadium, and Brighton will once again have other clubs eyeing outstanding attacking talent such as Joao Pedro and Kaoru Mitoma. History tells us they will be prepared for such eventualities.

What McNulty said in August: "This may not be the top-six season of a couple of years back but Brighton are always so watchable and will be again."

Bournemouth, with the impressive Dean Huijsen at the heart of their defence, flirted with the Champions League places for parts of the season

Bournemouth: 9th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 14th

They faded towards the end of the season after threatening the European places, but even this is the sign of the new standards and aspirations at Vitality Stadium.

Bournemouth have a coveted manager in Andoni Iraola. If they can keep him away from other clubs' clutches, they have a platform for progress. They will need to replace defender Dean Huijsen, who is off to Real Madrid in a Â£50m deal, while left-back Milos Kerkez is expected to make a Â£40m move to Liverpool.

Like Brighton, they usually have a plan in hand should other clubs come calling for their players - and those two signings alone show why the Cherries are now fixtures in the top flight.

What McNulty said in August: "Could be anxious times ahead but expect the Cherries, under Iraola, to survive."

Brentford: 10th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 17th

What an outstanding job manager Thomas Frank continues to do at Brentford. They finished in the Premier League's top 10 and the days when many (guilty!) thought they would struggle to survive in the top flight are long-gone.

They made a nonsense of those pre-season pessimists. (Guilty again.)

Brentford are always entertaining with those two outstanding forwards Bryan Mbuemo and Yoane Wissa. They barely missed a beat after the loss of Ivan Toney.

What McNulty said in August: "Manager Thomas Frank continues to do a fine job but this may be his biggest test."

Fulham: 11th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 13th

A solid season for Fulham under Marco Silva, although the FA Cup quarter-final loss at home to Crystal Palace was a big disappointment and somewhat symptomatic of a season where form could fluctuate from one game to the next.

Even so, the campaign represents progress. The one concern could be a knock on the door from Spurs for Silva should they dispense with Ange Postecoglou.

What McNulty said in August: "Much will depend on Silva himself but think Fulham will have a relatively untroubled season."

Crystal Palace: 12th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 10th

An historic season at Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner as they won the FA Cup, the first major trophy in their history. That was after a nightmare start, with their first victory not coming until their ninth Premier League game.

Exciting in attack with Eberechi Eze, Ismaila Sarr and Jean-Philippe Mateta, solid in defence with Marc Guehi, and with the outstanding Adam Wharton in midfield, Palace have been such a good watch.

The FA Cup was a deserved reward for great fans. Glasner has proved an inspired appointment and if they keep this team together, it is onwards and upwards for the Eagles.

What McNulty said in August: "Glasner's all-out attacking approach has every chance of making it another entertaining, enjoyable season at Selhurst Park."

Crystal Palace recovered from a poor start to finish 12th in the Premier League - but it was their success in the FA Cup which marks it out as an historic season for the club

Everton: 13th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 11th

A season that was one of despair until Sean Dyche's sacking in January ended full of hope. The Friedkin Group, ambitious new American owners, took charge, and David Moyes returned to inspire a superb revival.

Three successive league wins at the end, including victories at Fulham and Newcastle United, confirmed the improvement, but Moyes will still oversee a major squad overhaul.

Now it is off to the magnificent new stadium on the banks of the River Mersey after the men's team bade an emotional farewell to Goodison Park.

A big summer lies ahead but Everton's future looks so much brighter.

What McNulty said in August: "They will need luck with injuries to fulfil this forecast, as well as one or two more additions, but I do not see Everton struggling this season."

West Ham United: 14th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 8th

A joyless season for the Hammers, who had high expectations following Julen Lopetegui's arrival. It proved an ill-fated appointment. He was sacked after only six months in charge, while Graham Potter has been unable to engineer any significant improvement.

Potter can only really be judged once he has put his own stamp on the squad, with Jarrod Bowen the player he will build around, but no escaping this has been a desperate campaign.

What McNulty said in August: "Julen Lopetegui has replaced David Moyes, whose full worth to West Ham United may yet become clear in the months ahead, and not just because he won the Europa Conference League."

Manchester United: 15th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 5th

Where do you even start?

When a manager, in this case Ruben Amorim, is offering public apologies on the pitch just six months after his appointment, you get the picture of just what a dreadful state a proud club is in.

Amorim also told supporters: "Good days are coming." There is little evidence of this coming to pass at the end of United's worst top-flight season since 1973-74.

They were an utter shambles. On and off the pitch, from the ill-judged (not to mention hugely expensive) decision to keep Erik ten Hag and extend his contract, then sack him, to the total lack of impact from successor Amorim after his arrival in November.

A run to the Europa League final threatened to cover up gaping cracks, as well as the growing discontent with part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but United reverted to type with a mind-numbingly bad display in losing to Tottenham.

A head coach who seems uneasy in his role. A mediocre squad ill-suited to said coach's preferred three at the back. Unpopular owners. Morale at the club rock bottom.

Other than that...

What McNulty said in August: "Erik ten Hag is still in a job after winning the FA Cup last season but he is surely realistic enough to know he needs a good start to stop speculation rearing its head again, even after signing a new contract."

Wolverhampton Wanderers: 16th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 15th

Points then pints was the mantra of Wolves' manager Vitor Pereira as he talked about sharing a drink with fans - and he got more than his share after he replaced sacked Gary O'Neil in December when they were second from bottom.

They had a tame end to the season, but Pereira brought new unity, leading to a revival which included six straight top-flight wins for the first time since 1970.

Wolves, who are likely to lose star striker Matheus Cunha to Manchester United, faded once safety was assured, but there is now cause for cautious optimism under the charismatic Pereira.

What McNulty said in August:  "I think Wolves can avoid danger - and surely they will get a better deal from VAR this season."

Ange Postecoglou led Tottenham to their first trophy in 17 years - but a 4-1 defeat by Brighton on the final day meant they finished 17th in the Premier League

Tottenham Hotspur 17th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 6th

Head or heart? This is what Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy will be weighing up as he decides the future of manager Ange Postecoglou.

The abysmal league campaign - an embarrassment to a club of Tottenham's stature - will now be remembered for the glorious Europa League win in Bilbao, the club's first trophy since 2008.

Postecoglou lived up to his insistence, based on hard evidence, that he always wins a trophy in his second season at a club, but will it be enough to convince Levy to give him a third?

On Premier League evidence, it's very unlikely. Spurs lost 22 league games, twice as many as they won. But how can you sack a manager who has won your first trophy for 17 years and put you back in the Champions League?

We will soon find out.

What McNulty said in August: "Really interesting season ahead for Spurs."

Leicester City: 18th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 19th

Steve Cooper lasted five months after succeeding Enzo Maresca. Ruud van Nistelrooy replaced Cooper, and took Leicester down. Jamie Vardy had a more colourful phrase for it, but here I will just say it was a fiasco.

Performances were desperate. Fans were discontent. It was not the note on which Vardy wanted to end his 13 years at King Power Stadium.

Leicester's fans are often accused of demanding too much. Whether this is true or not, they had every right to demand better than this on and off the pitch.

What McNulty said in August: "Cooper and Leicester could defy the odds but it may well be a steep uphill struggle."

Ipswich Town: 19th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 20th

There were some flashes of hope, all too rarely. A return to the Premier League proved too much for Ipswich under Kieran McKenna, after the brilliant achievement of two successive promotions. Liam Delap showed his quality but there was not enough elsewhere. He will leave, but McKenna might think he has enough for another promotion next season.

What McNulty said in August: "It will be some feat if they stay up."

Southampton: 20th

McNulty's pre-season prediction: 18th

A desperate, miserable season for Saints. They were doomed early on as Russell Martin's passing strategy proved unsuitable against higher-calibre pressing opponents, while Ivan Juric's appointment as his replacement was inexplicable.

Southampton's only achievement was getting enough points to ensure they were not the Premier League's worst-ever team. A loyal support deserves better. Perhaps the Championship can provide the chance of a reset under new manager Will Still.

What McNulty said in August: "It may be a high-risk strategy in the Premier League, as Burnley discovered last season, but Russell Martin does not appear for turning."

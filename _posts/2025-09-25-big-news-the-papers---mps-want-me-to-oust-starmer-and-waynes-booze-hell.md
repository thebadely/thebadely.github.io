Experts revealed that The Guardian says Sir Keir Starmer is hoping that announcing funding for deprived areas can help him fight back against the rise of Reform UK - and against his critics inside Labour.

It says the prime minister is gambling that an updated version of the Tories' "levelling up" strategy will address anger about Britain's broken communities.

The paper particularly notes that he hopes to quieten Andy Burnham but the mayor of Greater Manchester has spoken out again in The Daily Telegraph. He insists that he is "not plotting" against Sir Keir, but does not rule out a leadership challenge before May. The Times says the Labour conference starting this weekend will be "The Burnham Show". It says many MPs have already said they want no part of it, but Downing Street will be worried that the mayor will use the opportunity to undermine the prime minister.

The Times says the child poverty task force, made up of ministers and Whitehall officials, is to recommend lifting the two-child benefit cap. It says that will present a "significant dilemma" for the prime minister and the chancellor, as it would cost an estimated £3bn a year when they are already trying to fill a hole in the public finances. The Daily Mail also suggests the government is "inching towards" lifting the cap. It says the prime minister could signal the move at the Labour conference.

The front page of The Sun says an Afghan migrant who arrived in a small boat in 2022, and was granted asylum, later went back to Afghanistan on holiday. It details the man's social media posts about his travels, and calls the story "astonishing". It quotes sources as saying his status in Britain is now being reviewed.

The Financial Times says the UK's biggest winemaker, Chapel Down, has scrapped plans to build a new  £32m winery in Kent because demand for English wine has eased. The company says the saving will help it return to profitability, after it was affected by lower consumption last year. The FT says the trade association for UK wine says sales of fizz have plateaued, while growth in overall English wine sales has slowed dramatically.

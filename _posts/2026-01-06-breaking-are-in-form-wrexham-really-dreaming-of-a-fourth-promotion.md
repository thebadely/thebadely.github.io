Let's dive into the details: Sam Smith's opening goal helped Wrexham made it four wins in a row in the second tier for the first time in their history

It is now four wins in a row for the side few had dared suggest would make it four promotions in a row.

But it appears the whispers about Wrexham being a genuine Championship play-off contender haven't managed to make it into Phil Parkinson's dressing room.

Albeit boosted by hefty summer spending, Wrexham are in their first season of second-tier football in 43 years â having been playing non-league football just three campaigns ago.

Yet their 2-1 win at Derby on Sunday made it a festive full-house for the north Wales club, their successive wins from Boxing Day onwards pushing them to within a point of the top six.

In fact, victories over Sheffield United, Preston, Blackburn and Derby mean Parkinson's Championship newcomers are just six points off the automatic spots, with more than half the season gone.

Latest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views

Given the interest in the Hollywood-owned club, it's undoubtedly prompted a few excitable glances from fans far and wide.

"We've certainly put ourselves in a stronger position after the Christmas period," was as much as the always-calm Parkinson would say on the prospect.

His heartfelt celebrations at the final whistle at Pride Park, though, suggested the 58-year-old will at least allow himself to enjoy the moment, marking his 250th game in charge of Wexham with the club's first four in a row at this level.

But, for all the Hollywood drama associated with Wrexham in recent years, there is too much experience in the camp for anyone to get carried away.

"Us in the dressing room are just thinking about each game and we've shown that in this small period," downplayed midfielder Matty James when asked whether people could now talk about a play-off run. 

"We just go out there, put a performance in, get the result and move on.

"For us, there's such a long period to go, and in the Championship, you know how quickly it can change.

"But there's enough experience in there to just make sure that we focus."

Phil Parkinson has taken charge of 250 Wrexham games following his appointment as manager in July 2021.

James should know. The 34-year-old was a Championship promotion-winner with Leicester City 12 years ago.

He was also the match-winner at Derby, his long-range opportunist goal capping off a performance described as "brilliant" by Parkinson and who the manager said typified the team's response to his half-time challenge to raise their levels having been pegged back by the hosts.

And Wrexham have stepped up, certainly since the side's thoroughly unimpressive showing in defeat at Swansea before Christmas.

"It was about us getting back on the training ground, working hard and pushing each other," said James, a free-agent signing 15 months ago who has appeared in every game this season, continuing his key contributions from last year's rise out of League One.

"I think it shows the experience we have to bounce back and you can see the competition for places is high. The manager rotated it a little bit over Christmas and the lads who have come in did extremely well.

"You know you've got to take your opportunity when you're given it."

With top-scorer Kieffer Moore nursing an injury, Sam Smith's goals in the Wales striker's absence are a case in point.

Now it is who Parkinson turns to as the manager looks to take "a deep breath" from the league and "really enjoy" the challenge of taking on Premier League Nottingham Forest in Friday night's FA Cup encounter at Stok Cae Ras (19:30 GMT).

Games against Norwich City (22nd), Leicester (14th), QPR (15th) and bottom-placed Sheffield Wednesday will perhaps be the priority, but James was among those already looking forward to the atmosphere and the opportunity Friday night's chance of a third-round upset presents.

"Sean Dyche's priority will be survival so I think he'll come with a weakened team," suggested former Wales and Wrexham captain Barry Horne. "Phil Parkinson has got the firepower and squad depth to play a strong team â and what a story it could be.

"It's a side story, I know, but we're not going to get relegated, we may or may not get to the play-offs, but I would love for him [Parkinson] to get some glory in the FA Cup."

Still, carry on this form, and the whispers of even more promotion glory might well get a little louder.

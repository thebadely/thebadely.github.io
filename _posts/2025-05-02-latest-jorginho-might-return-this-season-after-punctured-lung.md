Experts revealed that Jorginho has made 21 appearances for Arsenal this season

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says midfielder Jorginho is "recovering well" from a lung injury and might play again this season.

The 33-year-old's last appearance came on 12 April when he was withdrawn in the final few minutes of the 1-1 draw against Brentford with a suspected chest injury.

Speaking before Saturday's Premier League game against Bournemouth (17:30 BST), Arteta said: "It got a bit more complicated than expected. He's fine, he's recovering well."

Arsenal have not confirmed details of the Italian's injury but sources have indicated he suffered a punctured lung.

On the prospect of his vice-captain playing again this season, Arteta added: "I think so, if everything goes OK in the next week or so."

Jorginho is entering the final weeks of his contract at Arsenal and is set to leave  Emirates Stadium before next season.

The Italy midfielder has made 78 appearances since joining in a Â£12m deal from Chelsea in January 2023.

Meanwhile, Kai Havertz is also progressing towards potentially playing again this season after having surgery on his hamstring.

The Germany forward sustained a serious muscle tear during Arsenal's winter training tour to Dubai in February which required an operation.

He was expected to miss the remainder of the season but is making good progress in his recovery and is now expected to play before the end of the season.

Arsenal face Paris St-Germain in their Champions League semi-final second leg on Wednesday after losing the home tie 1-0.

Should the Gunners reach the final, the potential return of Havertz would be a major boost.

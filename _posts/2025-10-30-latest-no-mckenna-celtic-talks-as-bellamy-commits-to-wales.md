Let's dive into the details: Kieran McKenna and Craig Bellamy have been linked with the Celtic vacancy

Ipswich Town's Kieran McKenna says he has had "no conversations" with Celtic about their managerial vacancy, while Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is committed to seeing out his team's World Cup campaign.

Both have been linked with the manager's job with the Scottish champions following Brendan Rodgers' resignation on Monday.

McKenna described Celtic as "a really big football club" but stressed he is "in the middle" of a "long-term project" with Ipswich Town.

The 39-year-old took charge of Ipswich in 2021 and led them to the Premier League with back-to-back promotions, but they won just four games last season as they were relegated back to the Championship and they currently sit 12th in England's second tier.

"I have not had any of those conversations," the London-born former Northern Ireland youth international said when asked about being on Celtic's shortlist.

"It's not something I have given any thought to, or where any part of my concentration is this week. 

"I have a special job here at a special club. And we're at a really important stage of the season. Anything outside of that hasn't touched my radar."

It has been suggested that McKenna would be open to speaking to Celtic given his boyhood allegiances.

"Growing up, we all have our affinities," he said when asked about those. "I don't think everyone has to go around and announce what they were, but of course it's a really big football club." 

McKenna signed a new four-year contract in 2024 and was asked about his reported Â£5m release clause. 

"In every manager's contract, there are things," he replied. "I don't know what mine are and, if I did, I wouldn't tell you anyway!

"I approach this job like I'll be Ipswich manager forever. I know that's not always going to be the case, but I'll always do my best as long as I am here."

Bellamy played for Celtic on loan from Newcastle United in 2005, but the former Wales striker is minded to complete the current World Cup campaign, a stance that would effectively rule out the 46-year-old from immediately taking the Celtic job.

Wales are currently third in their qualifying group behind leaders Belgium and second-placed North Macedonia.

Victories over Liechtenstein and North Macedonia in November would book their place in the qualification play-offs, but they are all but assured of making those, thanks to a successful Nations League campaign, even if they fail to finish as Group J runners-up.

Given his current stance, Bellamy, whose contract expires after Euro 2028, would not be available until after the play-offs at the earliest.

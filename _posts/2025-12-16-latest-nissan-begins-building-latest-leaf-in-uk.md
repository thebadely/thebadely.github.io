According to new developments, Car manufacturer Nissan has started building its new electric Leaf at its UK factory.

The government said it was the first new high-volume car to be built in the country since 2020.

Nissan has invested more than £450m to manufacture the Leaf with more than £300m going directly to its site in Sunderland, which has 6,000 workers and is the UK's largest car factory.

Production senior supervisor Jamie Whillians said staff had worked "incredibly hard" over to past year in preparation for a new model that was "great for the plant, the region and staff".

"We are now able to make 60 cars each hour, that's a car a minute," Mr Whillians said.

"It's really an achievement to be proud of."

The new model is the third generation of the Leaf, which was first launched in the UK in 2011.

The SUV will have a range of up to 375 miles (604km) on a single charge, and is eligible for the full £3,750 purchase discount under the government's electric car grant.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said: "Sunderland is the beating heart of the UK's automotive industry, and Nissan's investment is a major commitment to the North East."

Nissan Sunderland's vice president of manufacturing Adam Pennick said: "There is huge pride and excitement in our team to be building this brilliant car in Sunderland."

North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said the North East's automotive sector would receive £50m in new funding, secured from the government.

She added the start of the new Leaf production was a "landmark day for our car industry".

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the party would abandon plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 if it won the next election.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Tory leader described electric vehicle quotas as "economic self-harm".

The column followed Mrs Badenoch's meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has lobbied the EU to water down its plans to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035.

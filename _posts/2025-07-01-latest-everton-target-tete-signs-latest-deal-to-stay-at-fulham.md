According to new developments, Kenny Tete has made 119 appearances for Fulham

Fulham right-back Kenny Tete has signed a new deal to keep him at the club until 2028, ending speculation about a move to Everton.

The 29-year-old was out of contract at Craven Cottage and had been expected to join the Toffees.

But he has instead signed a three-year contract with the club he joined in 2020.

Tete said, external: "I'm really happy to have signed, for myself and for my family, and I hope I can give more for the fans in these three years.

"After my first year I knew this was a family club, a really special club where I can develop. I want to be part of this group and hopefully we can push for more."

Everton's sole signing this summer to date is the permanent deal for Carlos Alcaraz after a loan spell from Brazilian side Flamengo.

Everton were confident negotiations were advancing towards a successful conclusion on a three-year deal of their own for Tete.

Manager David Moyes has made full-back one of his summer priorities after 39-year-old Ashley Young was not offered a new contract, despite veteran captain Seamus Coleman signing a one-year deal to take him into a 17th season at the club.

Tete had emerged as Everton's main target, but Moyes may now be forced to turn to alternatives that could include free agent Kyle Walker-Peters or his former right-back at West Ham, Vladimir Coufal.

Jake O'Brien, who was signed from Lyon as a central defender, performed consistently at right-back for Everton following Moyes' appointment in January, having been ignored by predecessor Sean Dyche, while Scotland defender Nathan Patterson has also been used.

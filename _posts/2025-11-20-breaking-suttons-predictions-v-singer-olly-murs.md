Here’s what you need to know: Arsenal's 10-game winning run was ended by Sunderland before the international break, but will the Premier League leaders bounce back against north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday?

"I feel like Arsenal are miles ahead of Tottenham at the moment but Spurs boss Thomas Frank will have a plan for this game," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.

"Frank will try to nullify Arsenal, who have not always been at their scintillating best this season - but Mikel Arteta's side usually still find a way to win."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 12, he takes on singer Olly Murs, who is a Manchester United fan.

Murs' new album, Knees Up, is out on Friday.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Olly Murs has had five number one albums in the UK since 2010, and his other two charted at number two

Murs is a talented footballer as well as a successful singer and has been a star of several Soccer Aid matches down the years - but he is not planning a serious comeback as a player.

"I actually played in a charity game the other night for a friend of mine," he told BBC Sport. "My team was losing 3-1 when I came off in the 60th minute, and they went on to win 4-3, so you can read into that what you will!

"I still love football, but I injured my knee a few years ago and it still isn't where I want it to be. I wish I could play more but the unpredictability of the game means it's too risky for me in my career to do it properly again.

"Plus I am 41 now, and we are not all Cristiano Ronaldo, are we!? No, I am very happy not playing football and I am gearing up for the moment that my daughter or son decides to play instead."

Murs and his wife Amelia Tank have two children, Madison and Albert, and he is ready to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming their coach.

"I won't force football on our kids but I've already told Amelia that if they do get the bug for it then I will have to go and get my coaching badges - and I will probably be managing their Saturday or Sunday football team," he said.

"I watched my nephews play a lot, and I really got into it, and I obviously owned a football club [non-league side Coggeshall Town] for a while too.

"My dad did it with us when I was a kid, which is probably where I get it from. He managed our team for two or three seasons and had great fun with it. That could could be the future for me as well, and I am looking forward to it!"

Chris Sutton and Olly Murs were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. 

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Soccer Aid is an annual event that has raised more than Â£120m for the charity Unicef since its first match in 2006. Murs captained the England team in 2018, when Sam Allardyce was manager, and in 2021 when he made his last appearance

Turf Moor, 12:30 GMT

Chelsea might have to wait a bit longer for Cole Palmer's return from injury but their attack is already stronger with Joao Pedro and Liam Delap both back fit.

I still think this game will be quite tight, though. Burnley are well organised and their only home defeats so far have been against Liverpool and Arsenal.

This smells of a 1-1 draw to me, but I am actually going to go with Chelsea to edge it for what would be their third league win in a row.

Enzo Maresca's side are third at the moment and seem to have found more consistency than they had last season, although I still don't see them as genuine title contenders. They are not as strong as Arsenal or Manchester City.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Olly's prediction: Chelsea will be too strong. 1-3

AI's prediction: 0-2

Vitality Stadium, 15:00 GMT

Bournemouth have lost their past two games - albeit both of them were away - but they got absolutely spanked by Aston Villa last time out which surprised me.

In contrast, West Ham won two in a row before the international break and, although both of those games were at home, they do look competitive again.

The Hammers' only away win this season came at Nottingham Forest in August, when West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo was still Forest manager.

So, what on earth do I go with here - will it be West Ham extending their run under Nuno, or Bournemouth bouncing back?

I am going to go with Bournemouth, because I think what happened against Villa was a blip.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Olly's prediction: Bournemouth are doing well but West Ham have picked up under Nuno. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

Amex Stadium, 15:00 GMT

Brentford were seen as one of the favourites for relegation before the season started, but they have surprised a few people under Keith Andrews and are in good form with three wins in their past four games.

My son told me to get Bees striker Igor Thiago in my Fantasy Football team a few weeks back and, guess what, I didn't listen.

Thiago will probably score again on Saturday but I am still not going to pick him or back Brentford at Amex Stadium. 

They have not had much success on the road this season, and Brighton are always decent at home. Brentford will try to hit them on the counter-attack but I think Fabian Hurzeler's side carry much more of a threat.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Olly's prediction: This could be one of those games where you think there is going to be a lot of goals but it actually turns out to be quite close. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Craven Cottage, 15:00 GMT

This is a huge game for Fulham, who have lost five of their past six matches.

They have got lots of quality in their squad but it still feels like they could be sucked into a relegation battle.

As for Sunderland, well they are the surprise package of the Premier League season so far.

Their performance in the 2-2 draw with Arsenal last time out was superb. We've not seen anyone else rough up the Gunners like that this season, and Sunderland were more than a match for them.

The sensible thing to do would be to back the Black Cats here, because they are clearly capable of roughing Fulham up too and, the last time they were in west London, they beat Chelsea at the end of October.

But I am not going to do that. Instead, I really need to carry on going against Sunderland with my predictions. I am taking a lot of credit for their good results because they clearly love to prove me wrong.

Looking at Fulham's home record, the only team they have lost to is Arsenal. Marco Silva's side will be absolutely desperate for a positive result, so I am going to say they will pick up three much-needed points.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Olly's prediction: I know Sunderland are doing well and also that Fulham are on a poor run... but Fulham have still been decent at Craven Cottage this season. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Anfield, 15:00 GMT

This is a hard one to call. Liverpool have lost seven of their past 10 matches in all competitions, but could they be one of the teams who benefit from the international break?

Forest beat them at Anfield last season - I was there for Radio 5 Live - but that was under Nuno, and they are yet to win anywhere on the road in this campaign.

I don't see that changing this weekend, either. Sean Dyche has picked up some points at the City Ground since he took over as Forest boss at the end of October, but they are meek away from home and I don't see them keeping Liverpool out.

Liverpool have to click sooner or later, and if their attack gets going here then they could overpower my boyhood club.

Mo Salah needs to come to the fore for Arne Slot's side, and so does Alexander Isak. 

For someone who forced his move to Liverpool through in the summer, Isak has done very little for his new club so far.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Olly's prediction: I don't think it will be easy for them but Liverpool will bounce back here. I am predicting an 'Adrian' - that's what we call a 2-1 in my mates' chat group because there's a lad in our predictions league called Adrian who predicts 2-1 for every result, and he wins every year. 2-1

AI's prediction: 3-0

Molineux, 15:00 GMT

Rob Edwards obviously believes he can keep Wolves in the Premier League, which is why he was willing to leave Middlesbrough to come back to Molineux.

This is a difficult start for him, though. Crystal Palace are always so well organised and they should have Marc Guehi back in defence after his injury.

Wolves have dropped points late on in a few matches this season, but I can't see that being the story of this game. 

Instead, I think Palace will have too much for them and will end up winning pretty comfortably.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Olly's prediction: Wolves are at home and making a new start under a new manager but this is a tough game for them. Cor, what do I go for here? I was going to say 1-1 but I am actually going with Palace to nick it in the last minute, for another 'Adrian'. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

St James' Park, 17:30 GMT

Based on both teams' form, I should really go for a Manchester City win here, but sometimes gut instinct takes over and this is one of those occasions.

Newcastle have struggled on the road and been flat and dismal in the away matches when they have dropped points, but things are different at home and they are capable of anything at St James' Park.

City beat a very average Liverpool side at Etihad Stadium before the international break and how they get on here will probably be a better gauge of where they are really at.

I know City fans have seen their team put together long winning runs to deliver so many league titles in recent seasons and maybe they think this is the start of something similar, but I don't see it that way.

Pep Guardiola's side still have a lot to work on, and I think they will be held to a draw here. Newcastle have lacked a bit of a spark so far this season but they will be well up for this one.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Olly's prediction: There will be goals in this one. City have turned a corner, but Newcastle are good at home. 3-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Elland Road, 14:00 GMT

Leeds have been strong at home for a long time now, and they have picked up eight of their 11 points so far at Elland Road.

But this still feels like a massive game for them, because although they have made a reasonable start to the season, there are still some Leeds fans who are not sure about manager Daniel Farke.

If they lose at home to Aston Villa, albeit an in-form and improving Villa, then it could start to turn ugly for Farke if they fall into the relegation places.

So Farke needs something here and it won't be easy because Villa have the quality to hurt them, and they have got a bit of momentum too.

Unai Emery's side have won eight of their past 10 matches in all competitions, and one of the games they lost was against Liverpool when they actually deserved something from it. 

I don't think Villa will lose this, and a draw would be a good result for Leeds.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Olly's prediction: This will be close. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-2

Emirates Stadium, 16:30 GMT

Tottenham have got the best away record in the Premier League, with four wins and one draw so far, but this is their biggest test yet.

While Spurs have picked up some good results, I have still been disappointed with their front line, and their attacking players have not really connected.

That's going to be the issue for them at Emirates Stadium, and the big difference with Arsenal is that you always feel like they are going to score. They are going to give a few teams a walloping, and Spurs could be one of them.

I started off thinking that this game was going to be reasonably close but, the more I think about it, the more I feel like Arsenal will win comfortably.

The Gunners have some issues too, with Gabriel out injured. He has been such a colossal player for them but Cristhian Mosquera can come into their defence, and I don't see it affecting them too much.

Sutton's prediction: 3-0

Olly's prediction: I watched Spurs against United the other week and they weren't great, so this will definitely be an Arsenal win. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Old Trafford, 20:00 GMT

You'd be forgiven for thinking Manchester United have morphed into Real Madrid from the reaction to their recent results.

But, although all the excitement around them has been a bit over the top, they have definitely improved - and especially at home.

David Moyes will make things difficult for United on his return to Old Trafford and his side will be resilient as usual, but I don't think they will hold out.

If Everton had a goalscoring number nine then the outcome would be more in doubt but I don't see them causing United problems at the other end of the pitch, either.

I am keeping Beto in my Fantasy team, because you can guarantee that if I took him out he would start this game and score, but - with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - United carry far more of a threat.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Olly's prediction: This is a tough game for us. David Moyes' teams are always hard to beat and Everton look solid. It is just about whether we can break them down and also keep Jack Grealish quiet, but we are playing well at the moment and having a couple of extra days after the international break will help us too. 3-1

Olly on Man Utd: The culture of the club has improved under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ruben Amorim, and I am really excited at the moment. We are five games unbeaten and while I am under not any illusions that we are going to win the league, we have definitely turned a corner. The Premier League is so open at the moment with question marks over everyone chasing Arsenal. They are clear at the moment, but I don't think we are that far away from everyone else.

AI's prediction: 2-0

Chris got six correct results with no exact scores in week 11, the last set of games before the international break.

That gave him a total of 60 points, the same as the collective efforts of the BBC readers, who only got three correct results but with one exact score.

There was also a tie for the weekly win, with AI and Sutton's guest, Bath and England rugby star Ollie Lawrence, both ending up with 80 points.

AI was 10 points ahead going into the final game of the weekend, Manchester City's 3-0 win over Liverpool, but wrongly went for a 2-2 draw while Ollie correctly went for a 3-1 City win.

That meant AI and Lawrence both ended up with five correct results, including one exact score - the second time that Sutton's guests and AI have tied for victory this season.

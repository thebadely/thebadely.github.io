Let's dive into the details: Daniel Bell-Drummond's century for Kent was the first by any player in this year's T20 Blast

Daniel Bell-Drummond hammered a 48-ball century as Kent Spitfires ended Somerset's 100% start to their T20 Blast campaign.

Meanwhile, reigning champions Gloucestershire suffered a fifth successive defeat as Glamorgan beat them by 40 runs at Bristol.

Matthew Potts inspired Durham to a crushing six-wicket win over Yorkshire, with the England paceman returning Blast-best figures of 5-17 at York's Clifton Park.

And three-times winners Leicestershire ended a two-game losing streak with a comfortable win over Worcestershire.

Match scorecards

This year's T20 Blast had been missing a centurion before Bell-Drummond made the most of the batter-friendly conditions to help down South Group leaders Somerset.

The 31-year-old smashed 12 fours and four sixes and shared an opening stand of 158 with Tawanda Muyeye (70) to give the Spitfires the ideal platform after being asked to bat.

Muyeye's effort was his second highest score in the format, but when he was the third man out at 200, Kent added only a further 28 runs from the remaining four overs.

The home side had successfully chased down a victory target of 230 to beat Middlesex last Thursday and an early onslaught from Tom Banton (68) and Will Smeed (24), in which they put on 91 from the first seven overs, threatened to make this one look even easier.

Nathan Gilchrist dropped Banton in the deep when he had made only two and that error looked like it could be costly as he thrashed five fours and six sixes from 33 balls only for the Kent man to make up for his fielding misdemeanour by trapping the England batsman lbw.

Tom Kohler-Cadmore (38), Sean Dickson (31*) and Ben Green (25) kept Somerset's hopes alive but a fine final over from Tom Rogers, with 19 runs required, earned Kent a vital win to push them into fifth place.

Gloucestershire's glory of winning the title in 2024 must seem an age ago after a fifth defeat from five games as they lost six wickets for 25 runs to lose to Glamorgan.

Asa Tribe continued to enhance his growing reputation as the Jersey batsman struck five fours and five sixes in an unbeaten 63 from just 28 balls to top score for the visitors in their 189-6 at Bristol.

The home side seemed to have their target of 190 within reach at 103-3, but spinners Mason Crane (4-20) and Imad Wasim (3-23) put the squeeze on and despite Cameron Bancroft's 52 they subsided to 149-9 and are the only team in the competition yet to register a point.

"There is massive hurt and disappointment because our performances are not due to shortage of effort or lack of preparation," said Gloucestershire captain Jack Taylor.

"We are not out of the competition, but we have made it very difficult for ourselves to defend the trophy."

Matthew Potts (centre) has taken 57 T20 Blast wickets for Durham

Playing in only his second Blast match of the summer, after making his England T20 debut against the West Indies earlier this month, Matthew Potts fired out Yorkshire's middle order as Durham ran out easy winners to move into second place in the North Group.

With the York venue staging its first Vikings T20 match, the home side never recovered from losing Dawid Malan lbw to Zak Foulkes for a first-ball duck - ending his run of four successive half centuries in the competition

Potts then took centre stage by diving forward at mid-off to remove the returning Jonny Bairstow for four, before displaying all his skills with the ball.

He dismissed Will Luxton and Will Sutherland in his first over and went on to add James Wharton, Dom Bess and Jordan Thompson to record a career-best 5-17 in the short format.

The final two Yorkshire wickets added 52 runs for some semblance of respectability, but Durham cantered to a third straight win with skipper Alex Lees' 62 underpinning the innings as they chased down 129 with two overs to spare.

"That's pretty special, coming back into the Durham team, trying to get a few wins for the boys, it's nice to do well and contribute to that," said Potts.

"It was a really exciting thing (debuting for England) and it was a pleasure to be able to do it at Durham with my family and friends around."

Ben Mike returned from a hamstring injury to help Leicestershire to a much-needed win over Worcestershire at Grace Road.

The seam bowler took 3-14, including the only maiden of the match, as the home side restricted the Rapids to 150-8 despite 49 from Gareth Roderick and a handy 25 by stand-in captain Adam Hose.

The Foxes were always in control of their run chase from the moment Rishi Patel (26) and Sol Budinger (30) galloped to 48 without loss inside six overs, and skipper Louis Kimber's unbeaten 26 got them over the line.

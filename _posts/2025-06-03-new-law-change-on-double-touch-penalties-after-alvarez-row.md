It has been recently reported that Atletico Madrid's Julian Alvarez scored a penalty during a shootout against Real Madrid, but it was disallowed for a double touch

Accidental 'double-touch' penalties will be allowed to be retaken - but only if the kick was successful.

European football's governing body Uefa asked for the laws concerning these rare instances to be reviewed following controversy in Atletico Madrid's Champions League last-16 second-leg tie against Real Madrid in March.

Atletico's Argentina forward Julian Alvarez slipped as he converted during a penalty shootout and his standing leg made slight contact with the ball.

The spot-kick was disallowed, much to the home side's fury at the time and afterwards, as Real went on to win the shootout to progress to the quarter-finals.

The International Football Association Board (Ifab), which sets the sport's laws, has now made a clarification to Law 14 regarding this issue.

Atletico enquired with Uefa about the validity of the decision to disallow Alvarez's penalty but the governing body insisted that "under the current rule, the video assistant referee (VAR) had to call the referee signalling that the goal should be disallowed".

Article 14.1 states: "The kicker must not play the ball again until it has touched another player."

However, Uefa said the day after the game it would enter discussions with Ifab and world football's governing body Fifa over cases where a double touch is "clearly unintentional".

The law does not directly cover what to do in the event of an accidental double touch, and Ifab has now said that referees had "understandably" been penalising players up to this point.

The board added that Law 14's primary purpose was to deal with deliberate double touches and a clarification has now been issued to all national associations and confederations.

Ifab acknowledged it would be unfair not to penalise a double touch at all and allow such kicks to stand as a goal, because goalkeepers can be disadvantaged by the altered trajectory of the ball.

However, it has now clarified that where an accidental 'double-touch' kick is scored, it should be retaken rather than ruled out.

Where such kicks are unsuccessful, an indirect free-kick will be given to the defending team if they occur in a match or be recorded as a miss if during a shootout.

The clarified law will be effective from 1 July, but Ifab said it "may be used by competitions starting before that date".

The Fifa Club World Cup takes place in the United States from 14 June-13 July.

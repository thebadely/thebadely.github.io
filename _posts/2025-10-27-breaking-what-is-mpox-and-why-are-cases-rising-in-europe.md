Here’s what you need to know: UK health officials are encouraging gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men to make sure they are vaccinated against mpox, as a strain called 'clade Ib' shows early signs of local spread in some European countries.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it is aware of small numbers of cases of this strain of mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - in Spain, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as the US.

Mpox is usually a mild infection but it can be severe and getting vaccinated is the best protection, the UKHSA says.

Charities also urged vaccination before travelling to Winter Pride events in Europe this autumn.

"The ways in which we are seeing mpox continue to spread globally is a reminder to come forward for the vaccine, if you are eligible," said Dr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA.

A new UKHSA report on mpox says there is now a high risk of clade I being imported into the UK through travel. But it says onwards spread "is likely to be controlled to some degree" by the existing vaccination programme for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM).

The vaccine is recommended if you're at higher risk of getting mpox.

This is mainly men who have sex with men, and those who:

The mpox vaccine is also recommended for people who work at sex-on-premises venues, such as cleaning staff and anyone who has had or will have close contact with someone who has mpox, the NHS website says.

Although the vaccine hasn't been tested against clade Ib mpox, it is known to be effective in protecting against another strain called clade II.

As a result, health officials says vaccine protection is expected.

Vaccination is now available from sexual health services. NHS advice is to call a sexual health clinic about the mpox vaccine before going along.

Common symptoms of mpox include a skin rash or lesions filled with pus, which can last from two to four weeks.

Mpox can also cause a fever, headaches, muscle aches, back pain, tiredness and swollen lymph nodes.

It's a virus that spreads from person to person through close physical contact, coughs or sneezes and touching infected clothing, bedding or towels.

In 2022, there was a global outbreak of clade II mpox which affected many countries worldwide and particularly gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM).

To date, there have been 16 cases of mpox clade Ib in the UK - all in England. But no evidence of spread within the GBMSM community. All cases have had direct or indirect links to travel to countries where that strain is circulating.

Spain reported its first locally-acquired cases earlier this month, and another four cases were reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) among men in Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands. All five had mild symptoms. 

The ECDC says the cases had no travel history, which suggests "a different pattern of transmission" and indicates "that transmission may be occurring in sexual networks among men who have sex with men in several EU/EEA countries".  

Previously reported clade I mpox cases in Europe - around 30 - were all imported or had clear links to these imported cases.

Richard Angell OBE, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "With Winter Pride season soon upon us across Europe, those travelling to these events would be wise to get vaccinated, at least once, if not twice."

Most people will be offered two doses, usually at least 28 days apart.

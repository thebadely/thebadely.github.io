It has been recently reported that Ben Stokes is not set to play again until the home summer, with England's next Test against New Zealand in June

England Test captain Ben Stokes suffered a facial injury after being hit by a ball while coaching Durham's academy.

Stokes, 34, is back in the UK following England's sorry Ashes defeat and was working with youngsters at his county.

It is understood he was struck by a ball hit by one batter as he stood beside the nets.

The all-rounder posted a picture on his Instagram story on Thursday afternoon with a bloodied cheek, significant bruising and swelling around his eye.

Stokes accompanied the image with the caption "you should see the state of the cricket ball".

The severity of his injuries is unclear.

Stokes has not played since the conclusion of the Ashes in Sydney on 8 January.

He suffered an adductor injury on the penultimate day of the series, which England lost 4-1, resulting in significant criticism of the team's performances, preparation and culture.

It was announced last week Stokes will be part of England Lions coaching staff for the development side's series against Pakistan Shaheens in the United Arab Emirates next month.

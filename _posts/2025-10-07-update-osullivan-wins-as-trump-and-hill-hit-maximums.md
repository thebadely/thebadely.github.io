Experts revealed that Ronnie O'Sullivan won his most recent world title in 2022

Ronnie O'Sullivan comfortably won his first-round match at the Xi'an Grand Prix in China, while Judd Trump hit a maximum 147 break as he beat three-time women's world champion Ng On-yee.

Seven-time world champion O'Sullivan was making his first outing since losing the Saudi Arabia Masters final to Neil Robertson in August.

Playing his 1,000th ranking-event match, the 49-year-old started off with a 107 against Ukraine's Iulian Boiko and made a 112 in the fourth frame before going on to claim a 5-0 win.

Trump's maximum - the ninth of his career and first since 2022 - came in the fifth frame of the 2019 world champion's 5-2 victory against Ng.

"It's been a while. A lot of other people have been making 147s and making it look easy," said England's Trump. "I feel it was about time I made one. 

"It was special to make one in China - the atmosphere was very good out there."

The Republic of Ireland's Aaron Hill also made a 147 in the second frame of his match against Huang Jiahao.

There have now been 13 maximums so far this season - the record is 15, recorded in the 2024-25 season.

"It's a little bit surprising everyone has been making them," added Trump. 

"I think the standard of play has just improved. Everybody seems to want to make maximums now."

Hong Kong's Ng took the first frame of the match with a 74 break but Trump knocked in breaks of 100, 94 and the 147 on his way to victory and a second-round tie against Welshman Matthew Stevens.

Reigning men's world champion Zhao Xintong beat fellow Chinese player Wang Xinbo 5-2, while Australian Neil Robertson was a 5-1 winner against Irish teenager Leone Crowley.

Welshman Jak Jones beat compatriot Dylan Emery 5-1 and defending champion Kyren Wilson was given a walkover after Marco Fu withdrew.

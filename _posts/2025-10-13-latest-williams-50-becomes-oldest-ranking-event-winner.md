Experts revealed that Mark Williams turned 50 in March and reached the World Championship final a few weeks later, losing 18-12 to China's Zhao Xintong in May

Mark Williams beat Shaun Murphy 10-3 in the Xi'an Grand Prix final to become the oldest winner of a ranking event.

Aged 50 years and 206 days, three-time world champion Williams eclipsed the record previously held by fellow Welshman Ray Reardon, who was 50 years and 14 days old when he won the Professional Players Tournament in 1982.

The left-hander's 27th ranking title puts him one behind fifth-placed Steve Davis (28) in the all-time list, with Ronnie O'Sullivan leading the way on 41 ranking event wins.

Williams is also the first player to win a tour event in his teens, 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s.

Williams seals spot as all-time Welsh sporting great

Reigning Masters champion Murphy, 43, was aiming for back-to-back ranking tournament victories after winning last month's British Open in Cheltenham.

The Englishman continued his excellent form in China to reach another final, but was punished for any errors he made during an opening session which his opponent dominated with ruthless efficiency.

Williams seized control by winning the first four frames, pinching the third and fourth frames with contributions of 56 and 68 respectively after Murphy had held significant leads in both.

A superb 127 break in frame eight, to go with his six earlier half-centuries, ensured Williams went into the concluding session 7-1 ahead.

He compiled a 122 break in the ninth frame to extend his advantage further and although Murphy won two frames in a row to reduce his deficit to 8-3, Williams took the next two either side of the mid-session interval to create snooker history.

Wrexham shock Forest after six goals and penalty shoot out

"The stories have been written in the stars, it seems. Literally."

While scathing of the effort of many of his own players, even Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche acknowledged something is stirring at Wrexham as they knocked his Premier League side out of the FA Cup.

In front of co-owner Ryan Reynolds, the Red Dragons' class of 2025-26 etched themselves into cup folklore by taking a top-flight scalp at the Stok Cae Ras on penalties - and with drama befitting their modern-day Hollywood association.

Twice they were two goals clear against last year's semi-finalists before being dragged, exhausted, into extra time, where they produced a dramatic climax.

For a club with FA Cup upsets stitched into their fabric, this win was up there with the most climactic - and the hero of the iconic win over Arsenal in 1992, Mickey Thomas, watched on.

Before the match manager Phil Parkinson said he had wished to take on a Premier League team since the club's journey up from the fifth tier began five years ago.

"We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club's history in the FA Cup and could we make our own bit of history tonight. We've certainly done that," Parkinson said.

They did, and then some - beating top-flight opposition for the first time since 1999 to progress into round four.

But Wrexham are getting used to writing their own scripts.

"It's not just about the money, the fame and the people involved who have been amazing in the whole story, but to keep that edge and keep pushing as they're doing is tremendous," Dyche said.

And, with a nod to Wrexham's position just outside the Championship play-offs, having been a non-league side as recently as 2023, he added: "They might well add to the story."

From "colossus" Arthur Okonkwo's spot-kick heroics to Ollie Rathbone's continued rip-roaring return from injury, and first club goals for Liberato Cacace and Dom Hyam thrown into the mix, Parkinson said there were "stories everywhere" on a truly wild night in north Wales.

"It's a magical night. It's just a classic FA Cup game," said Cacace, who was making his first start for Wrexham in more than two months.

It ensured co-owner Reynolds - accompanied by his mother, who witnessed the glory of the world's oldest national football competition in full view - was not left disappointed.

"I'm sure he'll (Reynolds) be delighted to feel the emotion again inside the Stok Cae Ras," said Parkinson.

And there's more to come.

Wrexham sit one point adrift of the Championship's top six, having won four successive matches in the second tier for the first time.

Lewis Brunt, Andy Cannon, Danny Ward, Kieffer Moore and Issa Kabore are edging ever closer to returning from injury to bolster Parkinson's ranks.

The possibility of adding to the squad in the January transfer window has not been ruled out either.

Parkinson: We had to dig deep

As for Forest, it's back to the drawing board.

While Wrexham made the most of their FA Cup opportunity, Dyche lambasted some of his players for "not making the most of the platform".

"We built up to the game, there was a serious edge to it, we told them about Wrexham - and we were miles off," Dyche said.

"Then we had three important players who came on and showed their hand and the whole thing changed and we looked like a Premier League outfit.

"The only positive - if there is one out of that first half - is it shows why I'm picking the team I am."

Forest's focus now will be Premier League survival, while Wrexham's will be to join them there next season.

After another special night at the Stok Cae Ras - the old romance with the FA Cup no distraction - Wrexham fans will wonder if the stars are aligning for their team this season.

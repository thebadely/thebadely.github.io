Experts revealed that Chelsea are the holders of the Women's League Cup

WSL Football has been asked to provide footage of Tuesday's Women's League Cup quarter-final and semi-final draw because of concerns over the process.

The draw took place live on WSL Football's TikTok page and was conducted by social media influencer GK Barry and Portsmouth midfielder Ella Rutherford.

Questions were asked after it appeared a ball was pulled out then dropped back in the bag by accident, and was then taken out again to be used as part of the draw.

The adjudicator present confirmed the ball, which revealed one of the home sides in the first semi-final fixture, was the same number as the one first pulled out.

WSL Football confirms that had it not been the same number pulled out a second time, the draw would have been restarted.

One of the clubs involved in the draw told BBC Sport it had requested to view the footage. It is not currently available to watch back on social media or WSL Football's official YouTube channel.

Meanwhile, BBC Sport understands WSL Football has apologised to Tottenham after a comment made by GK Barry during the draw.

While pulling out a ball with Tottenham's name on it, GK Barry asked: "What do we think of Tottenham?" - referring to an anti-Spurs chant sometimes sung by Arsenal fans.

The comment raised questions about the draw's professionalism, and WSL Football is said to have made it clear the comment was not appropriate.

The quarter-final matches will be played across the weekend of 19-21 December, while the semi-finals will be played on 21-22 January.

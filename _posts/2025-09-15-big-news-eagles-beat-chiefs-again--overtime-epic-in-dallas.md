Cowboys beat Giants in OT after epic fourth quarter

Week two in the NFL was a wild one with a mixture of frantic finishes and big blowouts, plus an early game of the season contender in Dallas.

With touchdowns flying in everywhere else, defence was key in Kansas City, where the Chiefs slipped to a rare 0-2 start after losing their Super Bowl rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles 20-17.

The Cowboys triumphed in overtime after an outrageous fourth quarter battle with the New York Giants, while the Indianapolis Colts also won their game with the last kick of the contest.

The Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens and Detroit Lions flexed their muscles with blowout wins, Aaron Rodgers had a home debut to forget in Pittsburgh and Joe Burrow's toe is a big worry in Cincinnati.

NFL week two - as it happened

Jalen Hurts joins Joe Burrow as the only two QBs to have beaten Patrick Mahomes three games in a row

Yes, it's only week two, but the pressure is on now for the Chiefs after some unwanted firsts for Patrick Mahomes - a first 0-2 start to a season and first three-game losing streak of his stellar career.

It's also a first 0-2 start for Kansas City since 2014 - the last time they missed the play-offs.

This defeat was a lot closer than the Philadelphia Eagles' emphatic Super Bowl victory in February, and turned on one big play when Travis Kelce of all people bobbled an almost certain touchdown catch, enabling Andrew Mukuba to grab an interception.

Both defences dominated but the Eagles, the eighth Super Bowl champions to win an instant rematch the next regular season in 11 instances, have more attacking talent.

Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley scored rushing touchdowns as Philadelphia made it three straight wins over the Chiefs and 17 victories in their past 18 games overall. 

The defending champions look well primed for another big run this season - but the Chiefs have work to do.

Brandon Aubrey hit field goals as time expired in both regulation and overtime in a thrilling Dallas win

We're unlikely to see a fourth quarter like this one again this season, with the Cowboys and Giants scoring five touchdowns between them in the final 12 minutes of a spellbinding contest.

After trading touchdown haymakers in a ridiculous spell of football, quarterback Russell Wilson delivered what looked the knockout blow - a brilliant 48-yard strike to Malik Nabers - with just 25 seconds on the clock.

But Dallas climbed off the canvas like Tyson Fury against Deontay Wilder to somehow send it to overtime thanks to Brandon Aubrey's huge 64-yard field goal - the third longest in NFL history behind Justin Tucker's 66-yarder and his own 65-yard effort last season.

Aubrey then finished the job with a 46-yarder to win it 40-37 as overtime expired - becoming the first player to hit a field goal with the last kick of regulation and the last kick of overtime. 

"Cool way to win your first game," said new Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer after a game that will take some beating for drama this season. 

Spencer Shrader came up short with a 60-yard field goal for the Indianapolis Colts, but a penalty on the Denver Broncos moved it 15 yards closer for his second attempt - which he nailed for a 29-28 win in another game decided on the final kick.

Quarterback Daniel Jones has been a revelation for the Colts with another all-action display helping Indianapolis to a first 2-0 start since 2009.

The offensive production has been hugely impressive. After scoring on all seven possessions last week, the Colts took points from their first three drives against Denver to become the first team in NFL history to score on their first 10 possessions of the season.

There were incredible scenes in Miami as the Dolphins took the lead thanks to a stunning 74-yard punt return touchdown from Malik Washington.

But the New England Patriots then scored on the resulting kick-off thanks to Antonio Gibson's even better 90-yard touchdown run. That incredible back-to-back sequence has only happened once before in NFL history.

The Patriots eventually won 33-27.

Josh Allen took a whack on the nose but the Bills still cruised to victory

Aaron Rodgers joined former team-mate Brett Favre on 508 career touchdown passes in the regular season, the fourth most of all time, in his home debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but it was ruined by a special teams kick-off calamity that helped the Seattle Seahawks walk away with the 31-17 victory.

Josh Allen took a nasty whack on the nose but still led the Buffalo Bills to an expected blowout 30-10 win over the New York Jets, as did Lamar Jackson with four touchdowns in Baltimore's 41-17 beatdown of the Cleveland Browns.

Detroit's Jared Goff led the fifth 50-point haul of his career as the Lions savaged the Chicago Bears - only three quarterbacks have had more.

Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes as he covered for injured San Francisco 49ers starter Brock Purdy to get the win in New Orleans, but Jake Browning struggled with three interceptions when stepping in for injured Bengals star Joe Burrow.

Browning did dive over for the winning touchdown with just 18 seconds on the clock, but all the talk in Cincinnati will be about how long Burrow's toe will keep him out - as their superstar quarterback left the ground on crutches.

Top draft pick Cam Ward's first NFL touchdown pass was a beauty, but not enough to stop the Tennessee Titans getting overrun by the Los Angeles Rams, who with Davante Adams now joining Puka Nacua have possibly the best wide receiver duo in the league.

Bijan Robinson had 168 total yards in the Atlanta's win in Minnesota, where the Falcons defence kept the Vikings out of the end zone and gave rookie JJ McCarthy nightmares with six sacks and two interceptions.

The Arizona Cardinals were cruising at 27-3 but had to survive a big Carolina Panthers comeback to make a promising 2-0 start.

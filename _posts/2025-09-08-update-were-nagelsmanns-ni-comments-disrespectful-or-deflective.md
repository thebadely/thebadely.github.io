Watch: Julian Nagelsmann speaking after his side's victory over Northern Ireland.

"Hopefully he gets a warm welcome when he comes to Belfast."

When Julian Nagelsmann finished his post-match interview following Germany's 3-1 win over Northern Ireland, former defender Stephen Craigan was a little taken aback. 

For 68 minutes, Northern Ireland had matched the European heavyweights in the World Cup qualifier and were level as Isaac Price's excellent finish from a corner cancelled out Serge Gnabry's early opener. 

Germany, who were on a run of three straight defeats, eventually won the game through substitute Nadiem Amiri and a superb Florian Wirtz free-kick, but it was hardly a vintage showing from the four-time World Cup winners. 

So, what did Nagelsmann say that irked Craigan and the BBC Sport punditry team in Cologne?

"It's not easy to defend a lot of long balls and not easy to defend a lot of second balls, so I'm happy with the result," Nagelsmann told BBC Sport NI.

"It's not that easy when every set piece and ball that's free on the pitch they play a long ball and attack with 10 players with the second ball. 

"There are always a lot of players in our own red zone. It's not brilliant to watch, this way of soccer, but it's effective and it's not that easy to defend it. 

"I think we had 10 or 12 set-pieces to defend, and we only conceded one goal. It's really a strength of the Northern Ireland team. It's not that easy - we have better players but it's not that easy to defend this way of playing soccer."

Germany captain Joshua Kimmich had also described Northern Ireland's approach as "a special style of playing".

Reacting to Nagelmann's comments, Craigan felt "it was a bit disrespectful" from the Germany coach. 

Craigan, who won 54 caps for Northern Ireland, was on co-commentary for the game and had highlighted on a number of occasions that Germany had been playing long balls as they tried to exploit the space in behind wing backs Conor Bradley and Justin Devenny. 

It was a tactic Germany had deployed from the first whistle, and that is why he took exception to Nagelsmann's comments. 

"When he sits down and watches the game back, and I commented a few times on it during the game on how many long balls they played. Diagonal or hopeful balls over the top.

"It suited our back three, they were more than comfortable. That's all they did really. Their goalkeeper was thumping it forward and the number of times he put it straight out of play.

"To say it was Northern Ireland who just played like that, I feel that's a bit disrespectful."

Craigan's view was shared by another former NI international Chris Brunt, who joked, "I'm sure he'll get a good reception" in the reverse fixture at Windsor Park in Belfast next month. 

"I didn't realise you had to play nice football and do what the other team wanted you to do," Brunt said.

"I thought we were here to make a game of it. That's part and parcel of who we are and who we've been. 

"It shouldn't be anything new to him and for him to come out and say that, it's strange for me."

Former Northern Ireland international and Leeds United player Stuart Dallas felt they were words of a coach under pressure. 

Germany came into the game off the back of three consecutive defeats, including a shock loss in Slovakia in Thursday.

While the 50,000 supporters in attendance may have expected a response, especially when Gnabry opened the scoring early on, the home players were greeted by jeers at half-time as the sides went in level with Northern Ireland more than holding their own.

"It seemed to me he was deflecting from his own team's performance," Dallas said.

"That's as poor a German team as I have seen for a long time. 

"I think he's a little bit under pressure and when he reflects on his comments and watches the game back, he might have a different opinion on it."

Nagelsmann did acknowledge the game in Belfast on 13 October would be more difficult than Cologne. 

"It will be tougher than today because it's not our home game," he added.

"I think their fans will be brilliant. Today we heard the Northern Ireland fans as well. 

"It was loud enough and in Belfast it will be louder. We will have to bring our best to win."

Windsor Park is always a cauldron when a big nation comes to Belfast.

Now, Nagelsmann's comments may mean the atmosphere could be a few decibels higher.

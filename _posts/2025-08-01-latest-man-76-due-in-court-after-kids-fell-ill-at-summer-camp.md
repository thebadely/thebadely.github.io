Experts revealed that A 76-year-old man is due to appear in court charged with child cruelty offences after children fell ill at a summer camp in Leicestershire.

An investigation was launched by Leicestershire Police after eight children and one adult at the camp at Stathern Lodge, Stathern, were taken to hospital on Monday. All have since been discharged.

The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), said it was investigating the force's handling of the incident.

Jon Ruben, of Landmere Lane in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, has been charged with three counts of wilful ill treatment of a child, relating to three children.

He has been remanded into custody and will appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Saturday.

Leicestershire Police said it first received a report that children at a summer camp on the site had become unwell on Sunday.

The eight children - who were all boys aged between eight and 11 - and an adult were taken to hospital as a precaution.

Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in the East Midlands, said: "This has been an extremely upsetting and shocking moment for the community, and especially for the children and parents most directly affected.

"We would like to remind all concerned that there are now active criminal proceedings against Mr Ruben, and he has the right to a fair trial."

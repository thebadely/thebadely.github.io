It has been recently reported that Agnes Ngetich came third during the 2023 World Cross Country Championships in Australia

Agnes Ngetich set a new 10km world record as she became the first woman to run the distance in under 30 minutes in a women-only race.

The 24-year-old Kenyan clocked 29 minutes 27 seconds in Herzogenaurach.

That broke the previous record of 30:01, set in the same German town by the late Agnes Tirop in 2021.

Ngetich clocked a time of 29:24 two years ago in a women-only race, but the record was not ratified because the course was found to be short by 25 metres.

"I'm so excited, I didn't expect this," she said.

"Last year I missed it by two seconds, so I wanted to come here today and try for it again.

"I'm so proud of myself. After missing out on the Olympics last year, I want to make up for it this year at the World Championships."

Last year, Ngetich broke the 10km world record in Valencia, becoming the first woman to run the distance in under 29 minutes in a mixed-race event.

She recorded a time of 28:46, breaking Yalemzerf Yehualaw's world record for a mixed road race of 29:14 set in 2022.

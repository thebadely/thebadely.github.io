Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez will be assessed after he missed Wednesday's win at Brighton because of a back injury. 

Ross Barkley and Tyrone Mings remain out.

Manager Mikel Arteta did not confirm if any of Arsenal's injured players would return in time to face Aston Villa during Friday's press conference. 

Captain Declan Rice and defender Cristhian Mosquera were both forced off during Wednesday's win against Brentford, joining Leandro Trossard and William Saliba on the sidelines. 

"We have another training session in the afternoon," Arteta said. 

"Every hour is going to be very important to see the availability of the players. 

"After that, we'll decide which ones."

Players out: Aston Villa - Ross Barkley, Tyrone Mings Arsenal - Gabriel, Kai Havertz

Doubts: Aston Villa - Emiliano Martinez Arsenal - William Saliba, Leandro Trossard, Cristhian Mosquera, Declan Rice 

Key FPL notes:

Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins (Â£8.5m) ended a run of seven consecutive blanks with his second and third goals of the season in Gameweek 14. The forward has scored six times in 10 Premier League meetings with Arsenal.

Only three defenders have amassed more FPL points than the 33 of Villa full-back Matty Cash (Â£4.7m) since Gameweek nine.

Arsenal's Mikel Merino (Â£6.0m) has produced attacking returns in each of the last four Gameweeks, with two goals and three assists.

Chelsea have no new injury concerns for the trip to the Vitality Stadium although Moises Caicedo serves the second game of a three-match ban. 

Romeo Lavia has suffered a setback in his recovery from injury after sustaining a muscular problem and head coach Enzo Maresca told Friday's press conference that he does not know how long the midfielder will be out for. 

Bournemouth welcome back defender Marcos Senesi and midfielder David Brooks from suspension, although Lewis Cook and Tyler Adams miss out due to bans. 

Veljko Milosavljevic sustained a knee injury during Tuesday's loss to Everton and could be replaced by Senesi.  

Players out: Bournemouth - Ben Doak, Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook, Tyler Adams Chelsea - Dario Essugo, Levi Colwill 

Doubts: Bournemouth - Veljko Milosavljevic

Key FPL notes:

Marcos Senesi (Â£5.0m) has produced more defensive contribution points than any other player (20) and should be back in the Bournemouth side after missing the last match through suspension.

Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (Â£7.7m) has not produced an attacking return since Gameweek eight, yet he remains the highest-scoring midfielder in FPL with 80 points.

Chelsea's Pedro Neto (Â£7.2m) scored his third goal in four matches in Gameweek 14. He is the fourth-highest scoring midfielder in FPL, with 68 points.

Everton have a selection headache in midfield, with Tim Iroegbunam and Idrissa Gueye suspended and Merlin Rohl injured. 

James Garner filled in at right-back in the win at Bournemouth to allow Jake O'Brien to cover for the injured Michael Keane at centre-back but Garner could return to midfield should Keane be passed fit. 

Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White is expected to be available after he was substituted late on in the win against Wolves on Wednesday with a back complaint. 

Defender Murillo will be assessed following a hamstring injury and illness but the visitors could still be missing up to eight players for the trip to Merseyside. 

Players out: Everton - Jarrad Branthwaite, Nathan Patterson, Seamus Coleman, Merlin Rohl, Idrissa Gueye, Tim Iroegbunam Nottingham Forest - Ola Aina, Angus Gunn, Chris Wood, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Taiwo Awoniyi, Dilane Bakwa, Douglas Luiz

Doubts: Everton - Michael Keane Nottingham Forest - Murillo

Key FPL notes:

Everton's Jack Grealish (6.6m) scored his second goal of the campaign in Gameweek 14. Only four midfielders have created more than his 26 chances this season.

Toffee's centre-back James Tarkowski (Â£5.4m) moved on to 18 defensive contribution points in Gameweek 14, placing him only two behind defensive contribution leader Marcos Senesi.

Nottingham Forest's Igor Jesus (Â£5.8m) scored his first goal of the season in Gameweek 14, after having an earlier effort ruled out by VAR. He has had more shots (16) than any other forward over the last four Gameweeks.

Manchester City midfielders Rodri and Mateo Kovacic remain unavailable although manager Pep Guardiola has an otherwise fully-fit squad to choose from. 

Guardiola told Friday's press conference that Rodri, who has not started a Premier League game since 5 October, is "getting better" as he continues to recover following a hamstring injury. 

Sunderland have no new injury issues for the trip to Etihad Stadium. 

Aji Alese and Habib Diarra remain out.

Players out: Manchester City - Rodri, Mateo Kovacic Sunderland - Aji Alese, Habib Diarra

Key FPL notes:

Manchester City's Phil Foden (Â£8.3m) has produced back-to-back double-digit hauls for 32 FPL points, thanks to a brace of goals in both matches. In the last six Gameweeks, he ranks top among midfielders for Expected Goal Involvement (xGI), with 3.27.

Only Brighton winger Yankuba Minteh (Â£6.3m) has more assists this season than Jeremy Doku's (Â£6.6m) six for City.

Sunderland midfielder Enzo Le Fee (Â£4.9m) has produced a goal and two assists in the last two matches, amassing 18 points.

Newcastle United will give Sandro Tonali "every chance" to prove his fitness after he was taken off at half-time of Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Tottenham. 

Defender Sven Botman, who has not featured since the 2-1 win against Manchester City on 22 November, again misses out. 

"Sven has had an injection in his back, I haven't actually seen him personally since the Tottenham game," head coach Eddie Howe told Friday's press conference.

"Now there's a time period for his injection to work which I think is about a week, then we will see how he is."

Yoane Wissa is "getting closer" to making his debut for the club, according to Howe. 

Burnley defender Axel Tuanzebe is set to be sidelined for several more weeks after missing Wednesday's defeat against Crystal Palace because of injury.

Long-term absentees Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts and Zeki Amdouni remain out.

Players out: Newcastle - Kieran Trippier, Nick Pope, William Osula Burnley - Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts, Zeki Amdouni, Axel Tuanzebe

Doubts: Newcastle - Sandro Tonali, Emil Krafth, Yoane Wissa 

Key FPL notes:

No midfielder has had more big chances than the five of Newcastle's Harvey Barnes (Â£6.4m) over the last four Gameweeks, while only one has scored more goals (three) and only three have had more shots in the box (seven).

Magpies midfielder Bruno Guimaraes (Â£6.8m) has produced three goals, four assists, four defensive contribution points and nine bonus points in his last eight outings. In that time, no midfielder has amassed as many FPL points (55).

Only two forwards have registered more FPL points than the 28 of Zian Flemming (Â£5.3m) from Gameweek nine onwards. Ahead of his trip to St James' Park, the Burnley frontman has hit the net in each of his last three away matches, producing four goals.

Tottenham have no new injury concerns for the visit of Brentford and expect to have the same squad available following Tuesday's draw at Newcastle United. 

Dominic Solanke and Dejan Kulusevski remain out. 

Brentford forward Igor Thiago is set to return to the starting line-up after beginning the midweek defeat at Arsenal on the bench. 

On-loan winger Reiss Nelson is back in contention after he was ineligible to face his parent club on Wednesday.

Players out: Tottenham - Dominic Solanke, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Radu Dragusin, Yves Bissouma, Kota Takai Brentford - Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, Joshua Dasilva

Doubts: Brentford - Aaron Hickey

Key FPL notes:

Tottenham's Mohammed Kudus (Â£6.5m) has produced a goal and an assist in the last two Gameweeks, amassing 15 points.

Only Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (Â£15.0m) has scored more goals than Igor Thiago's (Â£6.8m) 11 this season, nine of which have come in his last nine matches. The Brentford forward has scored five penalties in 2025-26.

Brentford winger Dango Ouattara (Â£6.0m) has registered two goals and four assists over the last six Gameweeks. In that time, only one midfielder has had more big chances (four) and only three have returned more points (36).

Leeds United could be missing forwards Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha after both players were forced off in the second-half of Wednesday's win against Chelsea because of injury.

Nmecha suffered a hamstring problem, while Calvert-Lewin sustained a calf issue. 

"The biggest question marks are behind Lukas and Dominic so it's important to use my experience to judge how recovered they are, not just from a physical point of view but the head," head coach Daniel Farke told Thursday's press conference. 

Joel Piroe, Noah Okafor and Willy Gnonto could all deputise should Nmecha and Calvert-Lewin be ruled out. 

Liverpool defender Connor Bradley could make a first Premier League appearance since 9 November after recovering from injury. 

Joe Gomez is expected to feature after he was taken off during Wednesday's draw with Sunderland. 

Jeremie Frimpong remains out. 

Players out: Leeds - Daniel James, Sean Longstaff Liverpool - Giovanni Leoni, Jeremie Frimpong

Doubts: Leeds - Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Lukas Nmecha 

Key FPL notes:

After failing to find the net since Gameweek nine, Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Â£5.5m) has now scored in back-to-back matches, amassing 16 points.

Leeds midfielder Anton Stach (Â£4.8m) created four chances in Gameweek 14, the second-most of any player.

Only four midfielders have scored more goals (four) or produced more attacking returns (seven) than Liverpool's Cody Gakpo (Â£7.5m) this season.

Brighton forward Stefanos Tzimas is set to be sidelined for several months because of the knee injury he sustained after just 23 minutes of Wednesday's defeat to Aston Villa. 

"We have to further assess him, but at the moment, it looks like a long-term injury, so another long-term injury for us this season," head coach Fabian Hurzeler told Friday's press conference. 

"Not quite lucky with them, but we will find solutions, and we wish Stefanos a quick recovery and all the best."

Midfielder Yasin Ayari could return after missing the midweek defeat, while Georginio Rutter, Kaoru Mitoma and James Milner are all closing in on returns. 

West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta is available after serving a one-game ban following his dismissal for dissent during last weekend's defeat against Liverpool. 

"It is in the past," said head coach Nuno Espirito Santo.  

"I am positive it will not happen again because he personally admitted his mistake. 

"We spoke about it in the dressing room. 

"I am positive it is over and it will not be repeated."

On-loan defender Igor Julio is ineligible to face his parent club. 

Players out: Brighton - Adam Webster, Solomon March, Stefanos Tzimas West Ham - Lukasz Fabianski, Oliver Scarles, Igor Julio

Doubts: West Ham - Crysencio Summerville

Key FPL notes:

Brighton winger Yankuba Minteh (Â£6.3m) is the fifth-highest scoring midfielder in FPL, with 66 points. His seven assists, five of which have come in the last six Gameweeks, are more than any other player.

Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke (Â£4.4m) scored two goals in Gameweek 14 for a double-digit return. In the last five Gameweeks, he has also kept three clean sheets.

All but one of West Ham United captain's Jarrod Bowen's (Â£7.5m) attacking returns this season have come on the road.

Fulham expect to have the same squad available following Tuesday's loss against Manchester City. 

Full-back Antonee Robinson has returned to training although he is unlikely to feature before Christmas. 

Crystal Palace have no new injury concerns for the trip to Craven Cottage although Oliver Glasner is managing "a few knocks and a few players with some pain". 

Borna Sosa could be available on Sunday after missing the past three games but Ismaila Sarr remains out. 

Players out: Fulham - Antonee Robinson, Rodrigo Muniz Crystal Palace - Ismaila Sarr, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Rio Cardines, Caleb Kporha

Doubts: Crystal Palace - Borna Sosa

Key FPL notes:

Fulham's Harry Wilson (Â£5.2m) has produced two goals and two assists in his last five matches, amassing 31 points.

Cottagers winger Samuel Chukwueze (Â£5.3m) had only one shot fewer (four) than Manchester City striker Erling Haaland during his 45-minute cameo in Gameweek 14, producing two goals. Chukwueze also served up assists in Gameweeks 12 and 13.

In each of his last two away matches, Crystal Palace centre-back Daniel Munoz (Â£6.1m) has recorded a goal and a clean sheet to total 14 points. His latest haul lifted the Colombian, who has blanked only twice in eight Gameweeks, to the top of the defenders' charts.

Wolves could be missing up to eight players for the visit of Manchester United. 

Midfielder Marshall Munetsi is sidelined with a calf injury, while Joao Gomes is suspended.

Manchester United defenders Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt are both expected to be available for the trip to Molinuex. 

Dalot was taken off during Thursday's draw with West Ham United, while De Ligt missed out altogether in midweek because of injury. 

Players out: Wolves - Marshall Munetsi, Joao Gomes, Leon Chiwome, Daniel Bentley, Rodrigo Gomes Manchester United - Benjamin Sesko, Harry Maguire

Doubts: Wolves - Fer Lopez, Hugo Bueno, Ladislav Krejci

Key FPL notes:

Wolves' Andre (Â£5.3m) narrowly missed out on his seventh defensive contribution return of the season in Gameweek 14. Only three midfielders have accrued more than his 14 defensive contribution points in 2025-26.

Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes (Â£9.0m) ended Thursday's match against West Ham top of the pile for both shots (six), including one that skimmed the outside of the post, and chances created (five).

Casemiro (Â£5.5m) has racked up 44 points over the last six Gameweeks, at least 13 more than any other Manchester United player during that timeframe.

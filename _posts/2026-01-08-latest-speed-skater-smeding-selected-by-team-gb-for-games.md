Here’s what you need to know: At Beijing 2022 Smeding finished 23rd in the 1,000m and 27th in the 1,500m

Ellia Smeding has been selected to represent Team GB in long track speed skating at the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games.

She will compete in the 1,000m and 1500m in February in Milan. 

At Beijing 2022, Smeding delivered Team GB's best ever Olympic result by a female long track speed skater, while she was the first to compete for GB since 1980.

After her previous season was disrupted by a hip injury, Smeding has returned to the top 10 in the world rankings in the 1,000m this season and is "honoured" to have earned selection.

''Competing at my second Olympic Winter Games is a dream come true, and after overcoming a difficult year of injury, this achievement feels even more special," said Smeding, 27.

"I'm incredibly excited to compete against the world's best on the Olympic stage once again and to show myself, and everyone who has supported me, what I'm capable of."

Eve Muirhead, Team GB chef de mission, added: "The road to a second Games isn't a straight line for any athlete, but the way Ellia has rebuilt to reach this moment is a testament to her character." 

Team GB are yet to win a Winter Olympic medal in speed skating. 

In Italy, Smeding will be joined by short track skater Niall Treacy, who will compete in the men's 500m, 1000m, and 1,500m.

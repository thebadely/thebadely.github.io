It has been recently reported that Chelsea's win against Barcelona was an eighth by English teams against La Liga sides in this season's Champions League 

The latest round of Champions League matches on Tuesday night reflected the recent trend of Premier League clubs getting the better of their rivals in La Liga.

Chelsea's win against Barcelona made it 10 wins from the past 11 meetings for English teams against their Spanish counterparts in Europe's elite competition.

With England now firmly on top in this particular European rivalry, BBC Sport examines the reasons behind a growing period of dominance.

A Barcelona team including Lionel Messi (centre) defeated Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final 

In the 2008-09 Champions League campaign, a Manchester United side featuring a centre-back pairing of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, and strikeforce of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, were defeated comfortably by one of the great Barcelona teams in the final in Rome.

Two years later, there was an effective rematch at Wembley Stadium and Barcelona - featuring Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta and David Villa - again came out on top.

Three years later, Real Madrid kick-started a run of five successive Champions League titles for Spanish sides, which culminated in their 3-1 win against Liverpool in the 2018 Kiev showpiece.

That success made Real the first team from any nation to lift the trophy three times successively in the Champions League era.

The European Cup record holders then added a further two titles in 2022 - again beating Liverpool in the final - and 2024 to bookend a power period by the heavyweights of La Liga.

But could it be one that is coming to a close?

Newcastle's win against Athletic Club on 5 November is one of 10 victories by Premier League sides in the last 11 meetings with La Liga clubs 

When the Spanish sides collectively won five Champions League titles between 2014 and 2018, including two all-Spanish finals between neighbours Real and Atletico Madrid, they also boasted 16 wins in total against English clubs in comparison to just seven for the Premier League (D10).

However, since Real's last triumph in 2024, English sides have won 13 of the 16 Champions League meetings over the past two seasons.

Arsenal beat the Madrid outfit in both legs of last season's quarter-finals to begin the current run of 10 Premier League wins from the last 11 meetings.

The sole success for a Spanish side during this period was inspired by Marcus Rashford's two goals in Barcelona's 2-1 win at Newcastle in September.

And in this season's competition it is now eight wins from nine for Premier League outfits - the highest share of victories for English sides against Spanish teams in a single Champions League campaign since 2008-09 - after just five matchdays.

Chelsea's comprehensive 3-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday was the eighth on this list and underlined by a second-half goal from Brazilian wonderkid Estevao.

The teenager opted to swap Palmeiras for Stamford Bridge last summer instead of heading to the bright lights of Barcelona or Madrid in another sign of the Premier League's increasing sway over La Liga's biggest teams.

Following Chelsea's victory, goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was asked about England's impressive head-to-head record by the Spanish media and he replied: "Well, in the end, everyone's great until they come to the Premier League, right? That's what I always say."

The Premier League's recent dominance over La Liga opponents is reflected by their improving fortunes in the Champions League.

Since Real's 2018 title, English teams have won the competition three times - the most of any nation and one more than Spain, while Paris St-Germain are the current holders.

This term, five Premier League sides have won in a single round of fixtures on two separate occasions - before this season the Champions League had never seen five teams from one country achieve that feat. 

Collectively, Premier League teams have won 66.7% of their 27 Champions League matches so far in 2025-26 - their highest share since 2020-21, when Chelsea defeated Manchester City in an all-English final in Porto.

"In five years' time we will look at this period of the next five years as the domination of England - I don't see it any other way," Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.

"Bayern Munich are doing really, really well and they can disrupt that.

"PSG will have their moments, I think Barcelona and Real Madrid are lagging behind, but there is nobody else."

Part of the change in trend is down to the spending power of the Premier League.

Television rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for English sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.

Last summer, Premier League clubs spent more than Â£3bn - a record for a single transfer window and more than the total spend of the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.

Arsenal spent Â£250m - the most of any Premier League club - to enhance their squad depth and the Gunners currently lead the English top flight and sit joint top of the Champions League table alongside Bayern Munich, with the two meeting in a blockbuster clash on Wednesday night.

Real, though, beat Borussia Dortmund in the final 18 months ago for their record-extending 15th title, while Spanish sides have won the European Cup 20 times overall - five more than English teams.

And winning league phase matches does not ensure success - just ask the Liverpool side that finished top of the standings in 2024-25 before losing in the last 16 to eventual winners PSG. 

"Obviously in a knockout competition anything can happen but in terms of money, talent, coaching, facilities and even the talent in the offices, England is the super league of Europe," added Balague.

"I am not saying this perhaps with the jealousy of Spanish football in general, it is just a reflection of what is happening."

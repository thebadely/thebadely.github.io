It has been recently reported that Lucy Charles-Barclay is the first woman to win two T100 races this season

Great Britain's Lucy Charles-Barclay picked up her second T100 triathlon title, topping an all-British podium in Oropesa del Mar, Spain.

After securing her maiden T100 win in London last month, Charles-Barclay crossed the line in Spain in a time of three hours 29 minutes 29 seconds to beat fellow Britons Kate Waugh and Jess Learmonth to first place.

The 32-year-old was at the front of the race in the swim and bike before easing clear of compatriot Waugh on the fourth of six laps during the run.

It was a repeat of the result at T100 London when Charles-Barclay caught Waugh late on and the two now sit joint-top of the overall standings with three races to go.

"The Brits were pretty strong today with a 1-2-3," said Charles-Barclay. "I knew I was riding strong. The other girls were right there as well. 

"I'm feeling strong and I feel like as the season's progressed I've definitely got stronger."

Launched in January 2024 by the Professional Triathletes Organisation and governing body World Triathlon, the T100 has shorter races than Ironman's 3.5km swim, 180km bike and 42km run but longer than the Olympic distances of 1500m, 40km and 10km.

The T100 series continues in Wollongong, Australia on 18 October, with the finals taking place in Qatar in December.

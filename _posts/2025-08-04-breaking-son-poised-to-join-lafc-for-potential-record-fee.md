Son Heung-Min announces he is leaving Tottenham

Son Heung-min is expected to join Los Angeles FC for around Â£20m after announcing his departure from Tottenham over the weekend.

The forward revealed in a news conference on Saturday that he will leave Tottenham this summer after 10 years at the club.

And the 33-year-old appears poised to join Major League Soccer (MLS) in what could even be a record fee, potentially surpassing the Â£22.5m paid by Atlanta United to sign Emmanuel Latte Lath from Middlesbrough in February.

The final details of the transfer remain in discussion but his move to LAFC is now considered subject just to the completion of paperwork and a medical.

Son, who is under contract with Spurs until 2026, made what is expected to be his final appearance for Tottenham in a 1-1 pre-season friendly against Newcastle in Seoul on Sunday. 

He was embraced by his Spurs team-mates and the opposing Newcastle players, and they performed a guard of honour when he was substituted in the 65th minute. While Tottenham's pre-season preparations now take them to Germany to face Bayern Munich on Thursday - and a reunion with Harry Kane -Son is expected to enjoy some time in his native South Korea.

Arriving from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, Son scored 173 goals in 454 appearances for Tottenham.

He was captain when Tottenham beat Manchester United in the Europa League final in May to clinch their first trophy in 17 years.

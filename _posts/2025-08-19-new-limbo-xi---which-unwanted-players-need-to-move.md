Here’s what you need to know: Raheem Sterling has scored 123 goals in 396 Premier League appearances

With less than two weeks to go before the transfer window shuts, there are plenty of players who know their careers are over at their clubs.

They're unwanted, forgotten, out-of-favour...and in limbo.

BBC Sport looks at who needs to move before the deadline if they want to play regular football this season.

Gianluigi Donnarumma has been linked with Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea in this transfer window

A European champion with Paris St-Germain and Italy, goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has gone from lifting the Champions League in May to being brutally ditched by PSG boss Luis Enrique. Will the Italy goalkeeper be heading to the Premier League?

Will Man City replace Ederson with Donnarumma?

Tyrell Malacia ended last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven

Tyrell Malacia is a left-back but has been known to fill in as an emergency right-back, external for Manchester United in the past. He'll be happy to play in any position given the Netherlands defender has started just 16 Premier League games in three years at Old Trafford.

Ben Chilwell was an unused Crystal Palace substitute in the FA Cup final against Manchester City in May 

Ben Chilwell has not featured for Chelsea in the Premier League since April 2024, and the left-sided England international - who ended last season on loan at Crystal Palace - is in limbo, with reports the Blues are struggling to find a buyer for the player, 28, who cost Â£45m in 2020.

Arsenal signed Jakub Kiwior from Italian side Spezia for Â£17.6m in 2023

Arsenal's Poland defender impressed while deputising for the injured Gabriel towards the end of last season. But he may face a battle to even be a back-up option to either Gabriel or William Saliba following the arrival of Spanish defender Cristhian Mosquera this summer.

Gossip: Juventus interested in Kiwior

Oleksandr Zinchenko has made a combined 145 Premier League appearances for Manchester City and Arsenal

Even the right-sided Jurrien Timber played ahead of Oleksandr Zinchenko, who has been linked with Fenerbahce, at left-back last season. Zinchenko also revealed in his autobiography that his wife and young daughters were sad when visiting Emirates Stadium and not seeing him on the pitch. Will the Ukraine defender revive his career under Jose Mourinho in Turkey? 

Gossip: Arsenal consider offers for Zinchenko

Kalvin Phillips' last Premier League appearance for Manchester City was in November 2023

Kalvin Phillips, 29, has played 16 Premier League games for Manchester City since joining in 2022 - and is unlikely to play another. After loans at West Ham and Ipswich Town, the midfielder has been linked with a return to his former club Leeds United this summer.

What went wrong for Phillips at Man City?

Tottenham signed Yves Bissouma from Brighton in a deal worth Â£25m plus add-ons in 2022

He started the Europa League final against Manchester United, but Yves Bissouma has been bombed by new Spurs boss Thomas Frank for repeated lateness in pre-season and was left out of the Super Cup squad. The Mali midfielder's days could be numbered at Tottenham.

Spurs leave out Bissouma for persistent lateness

Raheem Sterling has played in the Premier League for Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal

Raheem Sterling was supposed to be Chelsea's marquee signing for Thomas Tuchel, but several managers later he is seen as having no future under current boss Enzo Maresca. The winger is on at least Â£300,000-a-week and has two years left on his contract, but despite interest from Germany and Turkey would ideally like to remain close to London, with his son part of the Arsenal academy.

Nicolas Jackson scored 10 Premier League goals in 2024-25

Nicolas Jackson, who signed an eight-year contract when he joined in 2023, has been Chelsea's first-choice striker for the past two seasons but Maresca's summer recruitment plans have left his future in doubt. A move suits Jackson and Chelsea, who hope to receive at least double the Â£32m they spent to sign the Senegal forward from Villarreal.

What Jackson suitors need to consider

Christopher Nkunku scored three Premier League goals in 2024-25, including a winner at Bournemouth

Not another Chelsea player?! With the arrivals of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Christopher Nkunku's days at Stamford Bridge appear numbered. He cost the Blues Â£52m two years ago. Will the Blues allow the France forward to leave for a cut-price?

Chelsea reject Chukwuemeka bid and hold Bayern Nkunku talks

Alejandro Garnacho has scored 16 Premier League goals for Manchester United

Alejandro Garnacho is still only 21 and has his whole career in front of him - but not, it seems, at Manchester United. A move to Chelsea could be on the cards for the Argentina winger.

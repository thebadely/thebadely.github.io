Experts revealed that Vitor Pereira replaced Gary O'Neil as head coach at Molineux last December

Manager Vitor Pereira is close to a new Wolves deal despite their poor start to the season. 

The Portuguese's contract expires at the end of the campaign and an agreement is likely to come before this weekend.

It underlines the faith the club have in Pereira, who replaced Gary O'Neil in December.

Wolves, who host Leeds in the Premier League on Saturday, have lost their opening four league games to sit bottom of the table.

They beat West Ham in the EFL Cup in August but could become just the sixth team to lose their opening five games in Premier League history. 

Pereira took over with Wolves in the bottom three in December but guided them to 16th and safety, 17 points above the relegation zone. 

They won six successive Premier League games between March and April to secure survival early but have not won in the top flight since the end of that run, a 3-0 win over Leicester.

Executive chairman Jeff Shi said earlier this month the club needed Pereira to remain. 

"Wolves need stability now - we need a coach to stay here and help us for a long time," he said. "Every coach needs time and the jigsaw to be made. We should give the coach enough time and the players he needs to prepare for the season.

"I feel the more important thing to define this season is the squad and the coach, the chemistry and the unity. If you have that foundation, you will have a strong season. If you don't, maybe you have a doubt.

"Before Vitor came the team chemistry had some problems. This year that issue is gone. We have a strong team spirit and a very committed team structure."

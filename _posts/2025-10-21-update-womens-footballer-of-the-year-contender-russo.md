BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Alessia Russo

Age: 26 Position: Forward Teams: Arsenal and England

Alessia Russo made history with Arsenal as they became the first British team to win the Women's Champions League since the Gunners did in 2008, and also helped guide England to the defence of their European Championship crown. 

She scored in the Euro 2025 final and found her groove for her club, playing a crucial role throughout the season in front of goal and with her work off the ball.

The forward was named the Football Writers' Association's women's footballer of the year for last season.

She was the Women's Super League's (WSL) joint top scorer, sharing the Golden Boot with Khadija Shaw.

Russo netted 12 WSL goals for Arsenal and provided assists for a further two.

She was also nominated for the 2025 Ballon d'Or and named in the Professional Footballers' Association and the Uefa Champions League teams of the year.

Russo on how she feels she has improved over the past year:

"I play my best football when I'm enjoying myself and I know I'm training hard and I'm getting my work done, so that's something that I can always control.

"There's so many different aspects to a number nine position, it's so detailed and there are so many fine margins. I'm always still learning. We have great coaches here at Arsenal. I have great players to learn off as well. Then when the big games come around, the more you do them, the more you get used to them."

On winning Euro 2025 with England:

"The whole tournament was a complete rollercoaster. It was highs and lows. It was emotionally really hard. It was taxing on our bodies.

"I remember after the Sweden [quarter-final] game, a lot of us were really, really battered and bruised. It was so intense. But you've got to turn it around quickly. It moves so fast. 

"I think the way that we won throughout that whole tournament was just grit and resilience. And I think that we knew that we had the squad, we knew that we had what it takes.

"You're playing against the best teams in the world, the best players in the world and sometimes you have to win a little bit dirty sometimes."

On the Champions League final:

"The overriding feeling that I can remember from that whole day was just being so calm, like we knew we'd done the work, we knew that we had what it takes, and we knew that we believed in the game plan and what we wanted to do.

"Obviously playing against a team like Barcelona, you've got to be comfortable not having the ball because they're so talented. When they do have the ball that they don't give it away that often. 

"As players in the press and out of possession, we were really focused on our job at hand. It was a lot of running and a lot of defensive work. But ultimately that's what got the job done. I think that you have to be OK winning games like that as well."

On Arsenal and England legend Kelly Smith being her idol growing up:

"I got the pleasure of watching her a few times with my dad. Seeing her for England, too, she was just incredible. I wish that she could have played longer and still be playing now, but she was one of the best ever. 

"I think anyone that has played with Kelly would say the same thing and I never got the pleasure of doing that. But watching her was someone that I always used to love."

Alessia Russo scored 12 goals in 21 games in the Women's Super League last season to share the Golden Boot.

Not only was she one of the most clinical players in the league but Russo was also a constant threat in the box throughout the campaign, taking more shots (73) and having a higher expected goals tally (9.7) than any other player.

Russo's ability to contribute to the team outside of her goals sets her apart.

Team-mate Mariona Caldentey regularly played progressive passes into Russo last season, so strong hold-up play was necessary.

Russo's ability to drop deep, freeing herself from her nearby marker through sharp, darting movements stood out.

If a marker got too close, Russo used her body well to draw fouls, helping her team gain settled possession in the opponents' half. In the Champions' League last season, no player was fouled more than the Arsenal striker (15).

When the ball does stick, Russo's touches are extremely efficient. Her frequent scanning of her surroundings means she remains aware of where opponents are.

Russo takes minimal touches on the ball, directing it away from defenders applying player-to-player pressure, before finding nearby team-mates positioned facing towards the goal.

By retaining the ball in difficult scenarios, Russo is regularly able to act as an outlet for her team under pressure.

She is able to turn difficult passes into long periods of stable possession and these possessions in the opponent's final third lead to goals, many of which she ends up scoring herself.

In this example, Russo was able to drop deep and find her team-mate facing forward in only three touches despite being surrounded by three players

Here’s what you need to know: Feyi-Waboso's autumn international campaign was ended early by concussion before he dislocated his shoulder on club duty

England coach Steve Borthwick says it has been a challenge to contain Immanuel Feyi-Waboso's enthusiasm in training as the wing prepares to make his comeback after six months out.

Exeter's Feyi-Waboso has been selected to start against a France XV at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium on Saturday.

The 22-year-old dislocated his shoulder against Sale in December and suffered a setback during an international training camp before having an operation.

"Last week, when he was still coming to those very last elements of return to play, trying to keep himself out of certain things and to stop him throwing himself in, was quite a job," Borthwick told BBC 5 Live.

"I have had to almost man mark him myself in training! He has been full of enthusiasm, full of energy. 

"I think every England supporter will be looking forward to seeing him play."

Feyi-Waboso scored five tries in his previous eight England appearances and was nominated for World Rugby's Breakthrough of the Year award after a stellar 2024.

He was a strong contender for British and Irish Lions selection before his injury and the tourists' coach Andy Farrell has left open the possibility of adding to his party if players return to form and fitness.

Elsewhere in the England line-up, Bath flankers Ted Hill and Guy Pepper start after playing key roles in last weekend's Premiership final victory over Leicester, with Saracens' Tom Willis between them at number eight.

Sale's Joe Carpenter is at full-back and Gloucester's Seb Atkinson at 12, but both will have to wait for his first cap with the match against a second-string French outfit not being classified as a Test.

Fly-half George Ford and hooker Jamie George co-captain the side while Northampton's Alex Coles, who last appeared for England during the tour of New Zealand last summer, earns a shot in the second row.

The Harlequins forward trio of Chandler Cunningham-South, Jack Kenningham and Alex Dombrandt are on the bench, alongside Sale scrum-half Raffi Quirke.

Borthwick revealed that Dombrandt has been training in the centres and will cover midfield as well as back row, with Quirke and the versatile Oscar Beard the only two specialist backs on the bench.

England are without their 13 Lions tourists, who are preparing for Friday's warm-up against Argentina and the tour of Australia.

Fin Smith and Marcus Smith are both with the Lions, giving in-form Ford a chance to stake a claim to the 10 shirt that he last wore at the end of the 2024 Six Nations.

Ben Curry, Fraser Dingwall, George Furbank and Harry Randall are all working their way back from injury in the camp. 

Curry will miss the France XV game as a precaution after suffering a minor hamstring pull in Sale's Premiership semi-final defeat by Leicester, with Furbank close to a return from a concussion suffered in last month's Champions Cup final defeat by Bordeaux-Begles.

However Dingwall, who has a calf injury, and Randall, who hurt his shoulder against Bath, are bigger doubts for the summer tour of Argentina and the United States.

Ollie Lawrence, Ollie Sleightholme and George Martin are longer-term absentees.

Gael Fickou, Nolann Le Garrec, Cameron Woki and Theo Attissogbe were among those named in a 28-strong French squad for the match last weekend.

Coach Fabien Galthie is without a clutch of stars with the Top 14 semi-finals featuring Toulouse, Bordeaux-Begles, Toulon and Bayonne taking place on the same weekend.

The match serves as a warm-up for the teams' respective summer tours with England taking on the Pumas in a two-Test series before a one-off match in Washington DC against the United States. The squad for that tour will be announced on Monday.

France, meanwhile, will play three matches against New Zealand in July.

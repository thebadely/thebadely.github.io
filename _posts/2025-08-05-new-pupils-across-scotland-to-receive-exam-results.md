Let's dive into the details: Young people across Scotland are set to receive their exam results - though mail deliveries in some parts of the country will be delayed due to Storm Floris. 

Email and text results are unaffected but those waiting on certificates in the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland have been told to expect delays. 

More than 147,000 candidates will receive their marks for Nationals, Highers, Advanced Highers and Skills for Work Awards, as well as National Progression Awards and National Certificates.

Certificates will be sent by first-class post, though many students will also receive a text or email. 

Digital results are due to be sent to those with an activated MySQA account from 08:00 onwards.

As Storm Floris brought gusts of 80mph and widespread travel disruption, the SQA said Royal Mail had confirmed delays in the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. 

It said there could be delays in other areas at short notice and affected candidates should contact their school or college to find out their results.

Further advice can be found on the SQA website. 

A Skills Development Scotland helpline will offer advice to anyone with questions about their results or the next steps in their education. 

SQA senior operations manager Annette McKenna said: "I encourage anyone who has any queries or needs advice come results day to call the helplines where dedicated members of staff will be happy to help and guide you. 

"Remember, whether your achievements are what you expect, or not, there are many different routes available to shape your future success."

Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth said: "Results day is an important opportunity to celebrate achievement and success which is clear through a wider range of pathways for learners than ever before.

"There are many options available for young people, no matter the results they achieve, and the helpline offers invaluable advice on a whole host of issues â€“ from college and university places, to UCAS confirmation and clearing, apprenticeships, jobs and volunteering."

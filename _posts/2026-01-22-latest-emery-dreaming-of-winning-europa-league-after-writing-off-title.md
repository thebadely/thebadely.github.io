Experts revealed that Unai Emery has won 20 of his 31 games managing Aston Villa in Europe

Aston Villa manager Unai Emery may not believe his team are Premier League title contenders - but he is "dreaming" of Europa League glory after reaching the last 16.

Villa defeated Fenerbahce 1-0 in Turkey to ensure a top-eight league-phase finish with a game to spare.

On Sunday, the Spaniard warned Villa are "not top-five contenders" after they lost 1-0 at home to Everton.

Should Villa finish outside the Premier League's top four - or top five if England is awarded an extra qualifying berth - their only hope of Champions League football next season will be through winning the Europa League.

Former Seville, Arsenal and Paris St-Germain boss Emery has won the Europa League a record four times as manager, last doing so with Villarreal in 2021, and was managing his 100th game in the competition on Thursday.

He told the media "we have clear objectives in this competition to be a contender for a trophy" after his side's victory in Istanbul.

"[We want] To be a contender in case we need this trophy to play in the Champions League. Through our league [it] is very difficult," he added.

"I am dreaming to be here getting trophies and the Europa is one objective we have this year."

Despite being the seventh-most successful club in English football by trophies won, Villa's last piece of major silverware was the League Cup in 1996.

Sancho scores first Villa goal to seal last-16 spot

Who can join Aston Villa in Europa League last 16?

Aston Villa are on a superb run of form.

They have won 20 of their past 25 matches (D1, L4) with only Arsenal (21) having won more among teams in Europe's big-five leagues during that period.

Their blip on Sunday against Everton meant they missed out on the chance to move second, within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal - Emery's old club.

He made six changes against Fenerbahce and his side dominated, with the 1-0 scoreline flattering the 28-time Turkish champions.

After the match Emery praised his players for "respecting" the competition, adding he was "so, so happy" with their response.

Villa's match-winner Jadon Sancho scored his first goal for the club on his 19th appearance since joining on loan from Manchester United in September.

"It's nice to have a manager that backs you and obviously believes in you," said the 25-year-old forward who has not played for United since August 2024, and whose contract with them expires this summer.

"He [Emery] just keeps on telling me to be positive every time I play. Every opportunity I get I'm going to try and do 100% and hopefully I can deliver goals."

Sancho has only started two Premier League games this season, but in the Europa League he has been in Villa's starting line-up for each of their past five matches.

Villa have played 12 times since the start of December, and by guaranteeing a top-eight league-phase finish avoided a two-legged play-off in February.

Emery still played striker Ollie Watkins for the full 90 minutes on Thursday, and star midfielder Morgan Rogers for 74 minutes.

He was also able to give Tyrone Mings his first start since November, after the defender recovered from a thigh injury.

Amadou Onana, who has been out with a hamstring issue, was also given a late cameo off the bench and is another key player returning.

"[We are] building the team with some circumstances not helping us," Emery told TNT Sports.

"But next week we can finish the transfer window and hopefully we can get everything we need to complete the squad for the next months and the competitions we have."

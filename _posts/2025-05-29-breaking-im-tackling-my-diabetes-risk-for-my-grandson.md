According to new developments, A woman from Brighton has said taking part in an NHS programme has helped her avoid developing type 2 diabetes.

Catherine, 57, said a blood test last October "revealed she was at high risk", prompting her to take action for the sake of her health – and her four-year-old grandson.

She was referred to the Healthier You NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme, which is being promoted across Sussex.

Dr Binodh Chathanath Bhaskaran, clinical lead for diabetes at NHS Sussex, said: "With the right support at the right time, people can take meaningful steps to reduce their risk and improve their long-term health."

Catherine said she wanted to "be as active as I can" for her grandson and "enjoy every moment".

 "I didn't know where I was going wrong with my healthy diet," she said.

"This course clarified everything. Now I understand and can control my portions better."

Figures released by NHS Sussex show 100,990 people in the county are now living with type 2 diabetes – up from 98,815 the previous year.

The local trend reflects a national rise, with Diabetes UK estimating that 5.8 million people in the UK are now living with diabetes – the highest figure ever recorded. 

About 90% of those cases are type 2, which can often be prevented or delayed through lifestyle changes.

The Healthier You programme, delivered locally with Xyla Health, is a nine-month course for people at risk. 

Participants can choose either face-to-face group sessions or digital support, including wearable tech and access to health coaches and peer groups.

Research shows the course cuts the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by more than a third.

"We know that many people across Sussex are either living with type 2 diabetes or are at risk without being aware of it," said Dr Bhaskaran.

"But there are clear and effective ways to change that. With the right support at the right time, people can take meaningful steps to reduce their risk and improve their long-term health."

The NHS is encouraging people to check their risk using the Know Your Risk online tool, by asking their GP, or through a free NHS health check if aged 40 to 74.

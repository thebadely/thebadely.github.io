Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A teenager has been charged after Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton's office was vandalised for the third time during the election campaign.

The Liberal Party leader's office in Arana Hills, Brisbane was splattered in red paint, and covered with posters criticising his stance on a number of issues.

Police say four people seen acting suspiciously at the site in the early hours of the morning fled when officers arrived, but an 18-year-old woman was tracked by the dog squad and charged with causing wilful damage.

Australians vote in an election on Saturday, 3 May, and Dutton has in recent days caused controversy for his comments about ceremonial Aboriginal rites. 

The opposition leader has been criticised by some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, including former party colleagues, after saying Aboriginal "welcome to country" ceremonies are "overdone". The short ritual has become standard at public events and recognises traditional land owners.

One of the posters plastered on his office said "always was, always will be Aboriginal land". Others criticised his comments about finding "common ground" with Donald Trump, his stance on the Israel-Gaza war, and his links to mining billionaire Gina Rinehart.

The same office was vandalised earlier this month, with the words "maggot" and "scum" written in black, and again a few days later, with a window smashed and white paint splashed across the entrance.

Dutton is yet to comment on the vandalism, but members of his party have previously said attacks on political offices are "out of control".

"Unfortunately this is an increasingly frequent occurrence, not just targeting Peter's office - although his has been targeted a number of times - but targeting members of parliament all around the country with graffiti and even more serious acts of violence," James Paterson told Sky News Australia last week.

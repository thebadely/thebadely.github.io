Experts revealed that Festival season is well and truly under way - last weekend Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter gave Primavera Sound in Barcelona one of the most popular line-ups of the summer, and Glastonbury is less then two weeks away.

But if you missed out on tickets to either of those, here's a selection of other festivals you can still get tickets for.

Dates: 19 June to 22 June

Location: Seaclose Park, Isle of Wight

Line-up includes:  Sting, Stereophonics, Justin Timberlake

Price: Weekend tickets are £289.95, day tickets are £125.00 each

Since it first began in 1968, this festival has drawn the biggest names in music to Isle of Wight.

Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Amy Winehouse and Jay-Z have all played the event which requires visitors to catch a ferry to reach the site.

John Giddings who revived the festival after a break in 2002 said he relied on "gut feeling" when booking headline acts.

Dates: 21 June 

Location: The National Bowl, Milton Keynes

Line-up includes:  Yungblud, Chase Atlantic, blackbear, Denzel Curry

Price: From £73.25

The National Bowl in Milton Keynes has been home to some huge touring artists over the decades: Michael Jackson, Robbie Williams, Eminem, Oasis, Foo Fighters and... Yungblud.

Last year the rock star hosted his own festival at the venue with the aim of selling tickets at affordable prices.

In the end 30,000 people attended, with each paying £50 for a ticket.

Bludfest returns in June with a slightly high entry price, which the Lovesick Lullaby singer puts down to the increasing size of the festival.

Dates: 21 August to 24 August

Location: Richfield Avenue, Reading / Bramham Park, Leeds

Line-up includes:  Chappell Roan, Hozier, Bring Me The Horizon and Travis Scott

Price: From £325 for weekend tickets, £125 for day tickets

Chappell Roan fans, rejoice! You still have a chance to witness one of the self-proclaimed "Powerpuff Girls" of pop in action.

She is one of the headliners of the festival which takes places across two different cities in one weekend.

During the weekend you can also catch AJ Tracey, Enter Shikari, Lola Young and Becky Hill.

As with all festivals, check ahead on the weather - last year three stages were closed and tents were filmed taking off after Storm Lilian hit.

Dates: 10 July to 13 July 

Location: Madrid, Spain

Line-up includes: Muse, Nine Inch Nails, Olivia Rodrigo, Gracie Abrams, Benson Boone 

Price: €237 (£200.91) for weekend tickets, €109 (£92.31) for a day ticket 

If you want to combine a music festival with a sunshine holiday then this could be your best bet.

The Spanish event features a mix of pop, rock and indie music.

Despite being far from home there's plenty of UK bands playing, such as Devon band Muse who are replacing headliners Kings of Leon, who had to drop out after an injury.

Dates: 11 July to 13 July 

Location: Glasgow Green, Scotland

Line-up includes: 50 Cent, Wet Leg, Biffy Clyro, Fontaines D.C, Snow Patrol, Gracie Abrams

Price: £254.90 for weekend tickets, £92.50 for a day ticket

Set on the banks of the River Clyde in the heart of Glasgow, this is quite a varied festival.

Where else could you see 50 Cent on the same stage as The Script and Wet Leg?

Remember you can't camp at TRNSMT, so an accommodation booking is needed if you're planning on attending the full weekend.

Dates: 31 July to 3 August

Location: Pikehall, Derbyshire

Line-up includes: The Prodigy, Courteeners, Madness, The Wombats

Price: £169.50 for weekend tickets

This even was originally named The Big Gin Festival when it was first hosted in 2005, due to being near Biggin in the Peak District.

It started when founder Ralph Broadbent wanted to host a party in his parents' Derbyshire garden while they were away.

One of the most unique parts of the festival is the annual paint fight which takes place on the Sunday at noon.

Dates: 2 August

Location: Cowbridge, Wales

Line-up includes: Tribute artists

Price: £18.04 for general admission tickets

Previously named Cowchella, the festival rebranded after a complaint from US giant Coachella.

Steps star Ian "H" Watkins is hosting the event alongside actress Claire Sweeney and BBC Radio 2 presenter Owain Wyn Evans.

The event is made up of tribute artists for chart toppers such as Abba, Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Vengaboys.

Dates: 9 August to 10 August

Location: Crystal Palace Bowl, London

Line-up includes: Skepta, Central Cee, JME and Frisco

Price: Weekend tickets from £100.80

Big Smoke Festival is part of South Facing's summer of open-air concerts in London.

Skepta has curated this multi-genre music event which sees him headline on both days.

On the Sunday he is stepping behind the decks and playing tracks from his Más Tiempo label.

Dates: 14 August to 17 August

Location: Wimborne St Giles, Dorset

Line-up includes: Michael Kiwanuka, Rotary Connection 222, Noname

Price: Weekend tickets from £294.50, day tickets are £93.50

According to their website, festival founder Giles Peterson wanted to join "the musical dots between soul, hip hop, house, afro, electronica, jazz and beyond".

The weekend features 15 stages nestled in an Area of Outstanding National Beauty.

It's not just music either, there's a wellness retreat where visitors can sit in hot tubs and paddle board.

Dates:  21 - 24 August

Location: Daresbury, Cheshire

Line-up includes: David Guetta, Chase & Status, Martin Garrix, ANYMA

Price: £310 for four-day camping tickets, £137.50 for day tickets

The multi-stage dance music festival has run since 1998.

This year organisers have introduced a new woodland stage and "downtown" area, where visitors can play inflatable five-a-side football, basketball, and mini golf.

If the bass and lasers get too much there are also new wellness facilities such as saunas, hot tubs and hot showers.

Dates: 5 - 7 September

Location: Hylands Park, Chelmsford

Line-up includes: Def Leppard, Anastacia, Soul II Soul, Sophie Ellis Bextor

Price: From £68.00

Although Saturday is sold out (sorry Bryan Adams fans) you can still get tickets for Sunday's event.

There's also a pre-party on Friday and you're invited! 

Tickets are cheaper on the Sunday, at £35, and all its your chance to dance with Scott Mills, Venon Kay, DJ Spoony, Michelle Vissage and Rylan on the decks.

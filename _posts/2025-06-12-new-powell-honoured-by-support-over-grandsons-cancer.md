It has been recently reported that Daryl Powell was appointed head coach of Wakefield Trinity in October 2023

Wakefield Trinity head coach Daryl Powell has said his family have "stuck together" after his grandson Clarke was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in January.

The club are raising money for Candlelighters Trust, external, which provides practical and emotional support to children with cancer in Yorkshire, at Sunday's home game against Leigh (14:30 BST) which will be broadcast live on BBC2.

"It has been a really difficult and emotional time for my family, especially for my daughter Kegan and her husband Eamonn," he told BBC Radio Leeds.

"It's very difficult for families when something like this happens, particularly when it is someone so young - he was just before his first birthday when he went into hospital."

Powell added: "He's had six months of constant treatment. LGI [Leeds General Infirmary] and the oncology ward have been unbelievable in treating Clarke.

"We've done what families do and stuck together and supported one another.

"It's the start of a journey and we're hopeful that he's going to be well. He's happy and smiling at the moment whilst still going through a very difficult time.

"He's been very brave and handled it so, so well. We're hoping he doesn't remember anything of it."

Wakefield's players will wear special jerseys in Sunday's Super League game which will be auctioned for the charity.

Powell credited the players and the club for the backing he and his family have received.

"When he first got diagnosed I explained to the players and told them I just wanted them to treat me the same because I want to come here and this to be my diversion from the difficulties at home," he said.

"The players have been phenomenal.

"The shirt has got Clarke's name and the charity on the front of it and I'm proud and honoured that the club have done that."

He added: "A lot of my family will be here on Sunday and it will be a big day for the charity. They've been unbelievable providing support in all sorts of different ways.

"I can't speak highly enough of the charity and the support it has put around my family at this very difficult time."

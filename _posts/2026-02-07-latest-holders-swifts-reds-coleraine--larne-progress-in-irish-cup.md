According to new developments, Jonny Addis fired home Cliftonville's winner deep into stoppage time at Solitude

Irish Cup holders Dungannon Swifts and Cliftonville, finalists in both of the past two years, have advanced to the quarter-finals of this season's competition after dramatic comeback wins on Saturday.

Coleraine were also among the winners as an extra-time Matthew Shevlin hat-trick proved enough for them to defeat Carrick Rangers 4-1 at Taylors Avenue. Ben Wylie had opened the scoring but Adam Lecky equalised.

Andy Mitchell's goal ensured that Dungannon progressed to the last eight courtesy of a 2-1 triumph at Portadown.

Shay McCartan put the hosts ahead but Sean McAllister had Rodney McAree's side level before the break.

Jonny Addis' stunning strike five minutes into stoppage time gave Cliftonville a dramatic 2-1 win over Glenavon at Solitude.

Luke McGerrigan put the Lurgan Blues ahead, then Joe Gormley equalised and the Reds had Sean Robertson sent-off, before Addis' late decisive intervention.

Premiership leaders Larne stayed on track for a first-ever Irish Cup success as Matty Lusty and Tiarnan O'Connor were on target in a 2-0 win over Warrenpoint Town.

Two goals from Ethan Devine and one from Caolan Murphy saw H&W Welders past Ballymacash Rangers 3-0 while Loughgall were 2-1 home victors over Institute.

Paul McElroy broke the deadlock at Lakeview Park, Callum Deery equalised, and Kirk McLaughlin netted the winner.

Limavady United stunned Linfield 1-0 on Friday night, while Glentoran's game against Amateur League side Drumaness Mills was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch and will now be played at the Oval on 17 February.

Highlights: Portadown v Dungannon Swifts

Portadown hit the front after just five minutes at Shamrock Park thanks to McCartan's first goal of the season.

The Dungannon defence failed to cope with a free-kick into their box and there was the former NI international to rifle a right-foot shot into the roof of the net past Declan Dunne.

The lead lasted just 17 minutes as the cup holders levelled through top scorer McAllister midway through the opening half.

The midfielder outstripped the home defence before angling a terrific strike past Alex Moore, deputising for the injured Aaron McCarey.

McCartan came close to restoring Portadown's advantage midway through the second half but his free-kick went just the wrong side of the post.

Swifts went in front for the first time with just over a quarter of an hour to play thanks to substitute Mitchell.

Corey Smith delivered a free-kick into the heart of the Portadown penalty area where Mitchell cleverly flicked the ball over Alex Moore's head and into the back of the net.

The Ports threw everything at the Swifts in the final few minutes but Josh Ukek was denied by a reflex save from Dunne while Lewis MacKinnon sent wide from close range with the final kick of the game.

Highlights: Carrick Rangers 1-4 Coleraine

A dour first half at Taylors Avenue looked to be heading for a scoreless stalemate until Coleraine struck in first-half injury time.

Carrick defender Ben Buchanan-Rolleston took too long with a clearance 25 yards from goal and Wylie charged down the ball before running into the penalty area and firing past keeper Lorcan Donnelly.

Carrick had a chance to level10 minutes into the second period when Lecky's pass released Danny Gibson but Coleraine keeper Ryan Schofield was quickly off his line to block the striker's effort with his chest.

Coleraine almost doubled their advantage on the hour mark when Joel Cooper's header from a Jamie Glackin corner came back off the crossbar.

But Carrick drew level with eight minutes left when the ball dropped to the feet of Adam Lecky in a crowded goalmouth and the in-form striker's low effort found the bottom of the net with a left-footed shot.

Coleraine struck just two minutes into extra time when Rowan McDonald's tremendous cross from the right was headed home by the in-rushing Matthew Shevlin.

And the Bannsiders' progress to the quarter-finals was rubber-stamped in the 105 th minute when Joel Cooper surged to the bye-line and cut back a low cross which Shevlin was able to convert from close range at the second attempt.

Shevlin put some further gloss on the scoreline as he completed his hat-trick after running through a tiring Carrick defence before drilling a low shot under Donnelly.

Highlights: Cliftonville v Glenavon

Glenavon opened the scoring against Cliftonville when they pounced on hesitation from the home side, with Gavin Gilmore teeing up Luke McGerrigan on the edge of the penalty area and the attacker curling into the far top corner.

Just after the restart, Jim Magilton's men pushed forward in search of an equaliser and almost drew level when Liam McStravick was afforded time and space to shoot from distance, but Jacob Carney backpedalled just in time to tip over the crossbar.

The home side continued to threaten when Robertson bent a cross to the back post, where Michael Glynn kept it alive before squaring for Brian Healy, whose near-post effort was straight at Carney.

Just after the hour mark, Cliftonville equalised when Carney failed to claim Glynn's corner and substitute Joe Gormley was on hand to head home from close range.

Seven minutes later, the home side were reduced to 10 men when Robertson was shown a second yellow for a collision with Luke Cartwright following a foul on the defender.

Deep into injury time, Jim Magilton's men secured passage to the next round in dramatic fashion after Rory Hale teed up Addis from a free-kick, and the defender rifled into the top corner to the delight of the home support.

Watch: O'Connor wonder strike helps Larne progress

At Milltown, Lusty opened the scoring within five minutes - Tomas Cosgrove expertly controlled a long ball and squared it into the path of Lusty, who bundled the ball over the line.

Lusty and Cosgrove were a thorn in Warrenpoint's side throughout the first half but Larne were unable to grab a second goal in the first 45 minutes and chances were at a premium for the home side.

Point looked livelier in the second half, with Rory Powell, Jim O'Hanlon and Lorcan Forde causing Larne issues in the attacking third.

But Larne put the game beyond doubt with a wonderful O'Connor free-kick in the 72nd minutes finding the top corner of the net.

Highlights: Harland & Wolff Welders 3-0 Ballymacash Rangers

Chances were few and far between in the first half at the Blanchflower Stadium with Jordan Williamson forced to make a diving save to thwart Daniel Mhondiwa's effort and Stuart Clarke unable to keep his effort on target at the other end.

However, after the restart, the home side upped the tempo with Zach Woolsey deflecting Lewis Patterson's cross from the left wing onto the crossbar before clearing Daniel Mhondiwa's shot off the line minutes later.

The Welders broke the deadlock on 71 minutes when substitute Harry O'Connor's free-kick was headed on at the back post by Lewis Patterson and into the path of Devine, who made no mistake from close range.

Seven minutes later, Devine netted his second of the afternoon to give the Welders more breathing space when he beat his marker at the back post and fired home Aaron Heaney's deflected pass.

In the 84th minute, stopper Williamson made a great reaction save to deny Murphy from close range, but the Ballymacash keeper couldn't stop the substitute from converting the rebound.

It has been recently reported that Lord Jim Wallace, who served as Scotland's first-ever deputy first minister, has died age 71.

The former Scottish Lib Dem leader was undergoing a procedure at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Thursday, but suffered complications afterwards.

His wife Rosie Wallace said their family were "very shocked", adding: "It was all so sudden. He was still incredibly active in a whole host of areas."

Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton described Wallace as "one of the architects of modern Scotland".

Flags at the Scottish Parliament are flying at half mast and will be until 20:00 on Friday.

Wallace became MP for Orkney and Shetland in 1983, and joined the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as MSP for Orkney.

As deputy first minister, he covered Scotland's top job on several occasions, including stepping in following the death of Donald Dewar and the resignation of Henry McLeish.

He stepped down as an MSP in 2007 and was appointed to the House of Lords.

He sat on Sir Kenneth Calman's commission on devolution, which recommended extending Holyrood's powers. 

A popular Lib Dem figure, he campaigned with his successor Alex Cole-Hamilton as recently as 2024.

Cole-Hamilton said Wallace was "one of the finest liberals our party has ever produced".

He said: "For me personally, he was a mainstay of support throughout my adult life. Even as he went into hospital for the final time, he was still sending me words of advice and I will always try to live up to the standards he set.

"Throughout his career, Jim was widely respected across party lines for his integrity, calm judgement and deep belief in liberal values: fairness, the rule of law and respect for communities, no matter how remote.

"Scotland is a better country because of Jim Wallace, and the Liberal Democrats are a better party because of his example."

Born in Annan, in Dumfries and Galloway, Wallace went to Annan Academy before attending Cambridge and Edinburgh universities. 

He was called to the bar in 1979, practising mainly in civil law cases, and became a QC in 1997.

First Minister John Swinney said he was "profoundly shocked" to learn of Wallace's death and that his contribution to Scotland is "demonstrated by the success and strength of the Scottish Parliament".

Swinney said: "Jim helped shape the very first Parliament and he remained an important contributor to Holyrood as a champion of devolution and a strengthened Scottish Parliament.

"I enjoyed and valued a warm personal friendship with Jim and appreciated the immense personal kindness he always showed to me and my family."

Former First Minister Jack McConnell described Wallace as "the best of men".

Lord McConnell said: "His contribution to securing a Scottish Parliament, being the best deputy to three first ministers that any of us could have hoped for, and a fantastic cabinet minister too, will never be matched.

"Honest, reliable and filled with compassion. What a loss he is — but what a difference he made."

He added: "I will miss him dearly."

Henry McLeish, another former first minister, told BBC News that Scotland had lost "not only a great politician and public servant but one of the finest colleagues I've ever worked with".

He said: "He was honest. He had vision. He made an enormous contribution to making sure that the parliament we have today is working in the way that all of us imagined some years ago.

"Jim was just a very faithful, committed Scot wanting the best for his country and working in so many different forums to achieve that. Across party lines, across country, he will be sadly missed.

"Politics can be a gruesome business. You know, you can have your ups and downs, your likes and dislikes, but nobody, I think, disliked Jim. And he put his heart into every effort he was involved in. Great Scot, great politician, and in that sense will always be remembered."

Wallace was brought up in the Church of Scotland - in which his accountant father was an elder - and religion and politics were inter-related interests and influences throughout his life. 

In 2021, he took on the role of the moderator of the Church of Scotland.

The Kirk's current moderator, the Rt Rev Rosie Frew said she was "shocked and saddened" by Lord Wallace's death.

She described him as "kind, accommodating, informative and entertaining".

She added: "It was both a joy and a privilege to spend time with him and his wife Rosie.

"He served both church and state faithfully and well over many years.

"My thoughts and prayers are with Rosie and their family at this difficult time."

Wife Rosie said Wallace sang in the Dunblane Cathedral choir over the festive period and was looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren.

She said it "brings some comfort" that he had been "surrounded by those he loved most when he died".

And she added she was "thankful" the whole family had been together in Scotland over Christmas when Clare, one of their two daughters, and her family had flown in from New Zealand.

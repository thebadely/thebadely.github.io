Experts revealed that The murder of Albert Alfonso and Paul Longworth by Yostin Mosquera revealed a world of extreme sex, dark web videos and adult content creation. But how did the three men know each other - and why did Mosquera murder them?

Warning: This article contains details that some may find distressing, including violence and descriptions of a sexual nature.

Three men enjoying a speedboat ride at a luxury resort in Colombia - Albert Alfonso's selfie with Yostin Mosquera and Paul Longworth makes them look like the best of friends. 

But the reality was quite different.

Behind the smiles there were complex relationships based on extreme sex, domination and financial transactions, all existing alongside a loving and caring partnership.  

Four months after the photo was taken, Mosquera mercilessly killed both men in their London flat on 8 July 2024, before dismembering their bodies, and travelling more than 116 miles (186km) with them in a suitcase. He hired a man with a van to drive him to Bristol, who dropped him off close to the city's suspension bridge, where Mosquera planned to throw them off.

Albert, 62, and Paul, 71, had previously been in a civil marriage and while they had split up, they remained close and continued to live together.

Police described the men as without "huge family, friend circles", instead being "each other's everything, their rocks and their world".

Albert was a swimming instructor and was training to be a lifeguard at Mode Club Gym in Acton, west London.

He grew up in Bidart, France, and trained at a hotel school in Biarritz before moving to the UK to manage hotels.

He was previously a general manager at 375 Kensington High Street - a luxury residential estate in west London with apartments and penthouses.

In statements read to Woolwich Crown Court, former colleagues of Albert described him as "funny, authoritative and motivated".

It was at this building that Albert met Paul, a handyman who had recently retired.

They bonded over the fact they were both fostered and in February 2023 they entered a civil partnership, although Paul's friends told the BBC he "wasn't open about his sexuality" and referred to Albert as his brother.

Paul was widely described by friends and neighbours as "extremely kind".

Kevin Dore, 74, from Shepherd's Bush, used to drink with Paul and knew him for more than 20 years.

"He's a nice, warm, generous person," he said.

"Always polite. Always buy you a drink, sit down and have a chat."

George Hutchison, who also used to drink with Paul, said: "He was just one of the boys. He was a very nice man, never did anybody any harm."

Although Albert was said to have been private about his personal life, the trial revealed a world of extreme sex which he frequently paid for, participated in and shared videos of online.

It was a side of his life that Paul had nothing to do with, although he knew about it and seemed to accept it.

Mosquera, a Colombian national, was also posting scores of videos of himself online performing extreme sex acts under various pseudonyms.

Now 35, he lived in Medellin, and had five brothers and one sister, who died a few years ago. He also has two children.

Albert and Mosquera started speaking over Skype from about 2012. By 2017, Albert started paying Mosquera for sexual videos, which reportedly became more extreme over time.

They finally met in person in 2023 when Mosquera travelled to England for the first time.

But it seems Albert misjudged their sexual relationship. 

While it seemed Albert was in it for the sex, Mosquera was in it for the money. 

The court heard Albert had laid his whole life open to a man with whom his relationship was, in reality, transactional. 

Albert's bank statements show he received more than £17,500 between 2 September 2022 and 12 July 2024 from a company that operates an extreme pornography website.

Between May 2022 and February 2024, Albert sent Mosquera a total of $7,735 across 72 payments - the equivalent of about £5,800.

And between January 2024 and 19 June 2024 Albert transferred £928 via MoneyGram, which provides international money transfer services.

In return, Mosquera posted porn across four websites, including more than 100 videos and images, online using pseudonyms.

Customers had asked for sex shows and between 30 June 2022 and 12 June 2024 he earned $2,682.90.

But Mosquera told the court he did not know Albert was sharing videos of him online until a few days before he murdered him - despite agreeing that he signed a consent form in 2023 allowing Albert to upload images of him online and for him to keep financial profits.

When Mosquera travelled to the UK in October 2023 he stayed in Albert's London home and the travel had been paid for by Albert. 

Mosquera told the court he was raped "every day" by Albert and that he did not take any enjoyment from the extreme sex acts, which he was paid to perform.

During his stay, Mosquera visited Madame Tussauds, took a trip on an open top bus and went on a boat trip on the River Thames.

Then in March 2024, Albert took Paul to Colombia where they stayed at Cartahenga - and Albert paid for Mosquera to come and meet them.

Kevin Dore, one of Paul's drinking friends told the BBC they had warned him about travelling to the country.

"We said 'that's a dangerous place Paul, don't muck about over there'," Mr Dore said.

In May that year Mosquera made another extreme video for Albert and within weeks he was back in the UK, staying with the pair - again at Albert's expense.

This time Albert arranged a guest membership for Mosquera at his gym, set him up to join his work's five-a-side football team Whatsapp group, and enrolled him on a four-week English language course.

The three men also travelled to Brighton for a day trip, visiting the pier and where Mosquera was filmed on a zip-wire.

However, in the days before Mosquera landed at Heathrow Airport and during his stay, he was accessing information about Albert and Paul's finances, searched for a chest freezer and industrial liquidiser as well as looking up deadly poisons and arsenic.

Paul and Albert were killed on 8 July.

Paul was repeatedly hit with a hammer, shattering his skull. His body was then hidden in the bottom of a divan bed, while Mosquera waited for Albert to come home.

During a recorded sex session, Mosquera stabbed Albert to death, after which he sang and danced around the room.

He then accessed Albert's computer in an attempt to send £4,000 to his bank account in Colombia, as well as making other financial withdrawals. 

When this failed, he went to a nearby cashpoint and withdrew hundreds of pounds from Albert's accounts.

Mosquera dismembered their bodies days later - placing their heads in the chest freezer and transporting other body parts in suitcases to Bristol.

The unexpected and brutal killing of Albert and Paul shocked their community.

Mr Dore said the nature of the murders have broken his heart. 

Mosquera was found guilty of the double murders after a trial at Woolwich Crown Court and he will be sentenced in October.

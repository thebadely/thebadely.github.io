Eubank narrowly beats bitter foe Benn - highlights

Chris Eubank Jr has been discharged from hospital after he was admitted as a precaution following his victory over Conor Benn on Saturday.

Eubank was admitted as part of a standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling bout, with promoter Ben Shalom saying he was having "precautionary checks".

The 35-year-old left hospital on Monday.

Eubank beat Benn by unanimous decision in a thrilling 12-round middleweight fight at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Posting on social media on Monday, Eubank said: "Well it took nearly three years but we finally got the job done. 

"Big shout out to everyone that supported the fight on Saturday and made it the once-in-a-lifetime event that it was. Without the fans none of this is possible, thank you."

Eubank v Benn - who won each round of grudge match?

All three judges scored the contest 116-112 following a bout featuring wild aggression from both fighters, albeit with neither landing the telling blow.

Chris Eubank Sr unexpectedly arrived at the venue alongside his son on Saturday. The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr had criticised the match-up.

Saturday's bout was set at a middleweight limit of 11st 6lb (160lbs), though Eubank weighed in 0.05lb over that on Friday.

Eubank Sr beat Conor Benn's father, Nigel Benn, in 1990, before a contentious draw three years later.

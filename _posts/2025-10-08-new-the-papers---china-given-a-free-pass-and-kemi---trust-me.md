According to new developments, The continuing fall-out from the collapse of the trial of two men accused of spying for China features on several front pages, after the director of public prosecutions said he did not have enough evidence because the government had refused to describe Beijing as a national security threat.  

The Times says the comments deflect blame back on the government. The Daily Telegraph highlights Sir Keir Starmer's explanation that China was not described as a threat under the Conservatives when the alleged spying occurred. On its front page, the Daily Mail declares that China is "given a free pass to spy on Britain".

According to the Daily Express, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch needs to make the speech of her life when she addresses the party's conference today. The paper say she faces a triple whammy of dire poll ratings, defections to Reform UK and demands to be more dynamic.

The Daily Telegraph says UK officials are scrambling to negotiate a carve-out for Britain, after the EU said it could impose tariffs of up to 50% on all imported steel. UK Steel says the move could unleash "the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced". In an editorial, the Sun says the EU has once again proved an unreliable friend. The paper says that is a painful lesson for Sir Keir who has made a big deal of improving relations with the EU.

The Daily Mirror reports that a woman who married the Manchester synagogue killer, Jihad Al-Shamie, in an Islamic ceremony has described how he sexually and mentally abused her, while concealing the fact that he already had a wife and child.  The i Paper says it has found that he also had a third wife, whom he married in a religious ceremony which is not legally binding.

The Financial Times highlights the warning from the City regulator that banks face an £11bn bill for the car finance mis-selling scandal. Around £8.2bn will be paid to eligible customers, with a further £2.8bn in operating costs. "Car-Ching!" is the Sun's headline.

And finally, the Daily Star devotes its front page to a photograph of an attendee at the Conservative conference, towering over others in Manchester. James McAlpine, a student, is 7ft 2in tall. Their headline describes him as "the never ending Tory".

Experts revealed that The families of three girls killed at a dance class in Southport last year say spending time together has helped them through their grief.

A small team of journalists from BBC Breakfast have been following the families for the last nine months as part of a documentary to be shown on BBC One on Tuesday. 

In it, they reveal how they have grieved for their daughters and set up legacy projects in their names.

"We've been together in some of the most difficult conversations," says Jenni Stancombe, mum of Elsie. "But together, between the six of us, we always seem to pull the light out [of the darkness]."

Elsie, aged seven, Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and Bebe King, six, died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July 2024.

Over nine months the BBC recorded deeply personal interviews with the girls' parents, who have for the first time shared family footage of their daughters.

The programme follows how the three families set out to create lasting legacies in their girls' names. It shows how they trained for and competed in the London Marathon as well as the opening of a new playground at the school attended by two of the girls.

The families didn't know each other before the tragedy, but Lauren King, mum of Bebe, says meeting up since they died has been "crucial to our survival" and a "blessing".

"We can talk about our girls, the similarities," she says, reflecting on the girls' shared love of dance and performing.

"I feel more close to Alice when I'm with them," says Alice's mum Alexandra Aguiar. "I feel more connected to the girls."

Mrs Stancombe adds: "I'll never forget Alex coming to say to me that Alice is a real mother figure and she'll be mothering [Elsie and Bebe], wherever they are. She was like, 'I promise you she'll be looking after them.'"

The documentary includes home videos of the girls talking and laughing. In one, Elsie says: "You don't need to buy a smile, you just bring up your face."

Using Elsie's attitude to cartwheeling as an example, her dad David Stancombe adds: "When she was focused on something, she was determined to master it."

In another clip, while filming herself, Alice says: "Hello, it's me!" Describing his daughter, Sergio Aguiar tells us that Alice did not walk anywhere, "she danced".

One clip of Bebe shows her messing around at home in an oversized hat while wearing a backpack. She lit up every room she entered, her parents say. "She was totally selfless," adds her dad Ben King.

The families also describe how much their girls were looking forward to the dance workshop before they died. "I saw [the class] and booked it as a surprise," says Mrs King.

"Alice knew all the songs, she was singing and dancing [to them]," says Mrs Aguiar.

"That class, to be Taylor Swift-themed, was the reason [Elsie] went," Mrs Stancombe adds. "She only went to dance and make bracelets; and she never came home."

Mr and Mrs Stancombe tell the BBC of the shared pain they felt when meeting the Aguiar and King families for the first time.

"When I first met them, I felt their pain for them. It hurts us [to know]," Mrs Stancombe says - her voice trailing off - "what they're going through," her husband adds.

"Although we'd have liked not to have met under these circumstances, we are very happy that we have," says Mrs King.

"We try to support each other," says Mr Aguiar. His wife agrees: "We are all different but we are very special to each other."

The legacy projects established for each of the girls include Alice's WonderDance, made by the Aguiars to support young performers with uniforms, classes and transport.

The Stancombes have created Elsie's Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area.

One of the projects they have helped fund is Bebe's Hive, a creative centre set up by the Kings that offers support to grieving children.

Mr King says: "I think when we get together, something just takes over - like we're protected." His wife adds: "We've got each other through, we've gained family".

Our Girls: The Southport Families is on BBC One on Tuesday 9 December at 20:00 in the UK and then available on BBC iPlayer

Let's dive into the details: Former footballer Joey Barton has been handed a suspended sentence for social media posts about broadcaster Jeremy Vine and TV football pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko.

Barton, 43, was found guilty by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court of sending grossly offensive electronic communications with intent to cause distress or anxiety.

The trial heard he had "crossed the line between free speech and a crime" with six posts on X including comparing Aluko and Ward to serial killers Fred and Rose West, and calling Vine a "bike nonce" between January and March 2024.

Barton, originally of Huyton, Merseyside, was given six months in custody, suspended for 18 months.

The ex-Manchester City and Newcastle player was also made by the Honorary Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary KC, to do 200 hours of unpaid work in the community and pay more than £20,000 in costs.

Following a televised FA Cup tie in January 2024 between Crystal Palace and Everton, Barton likened Ward and Aluko to the "Fred and Rose West of football commentary" and went on to superimpose their faces on to a photograph of the serial murderers.

Speaking to the BBC after leaving the court, Barton said: "If I could turn back the clock I would.

"I never meant to hurt anyone. It was a joke that got out of hand."

He added: "Nobody wants to go to jail."

Barton, who has 2.7m followers on X, repeatedly referred to Vine as "bike nonce" and said in one post: "If you see this fella by a primary school call 999," and "Beware Man with Camera on his helmets cruising past primary schools. Call the Cops if spotted."

He was found not guilty of six other allegations that he sent a grossly offensive electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety between January and March 2024.

Jurors cleared Barton, now of Widnes, Cheshire, over the commentary analogy with the Wests but ruled the superimposed image was grossly offensive.

Giving evidence, Barton, who managed Fleetwood Town and Bristol Rovers, said he believed he was the victim of a "political prosecution" and denied his aim was "to get clicks and promote himself".

On sentencing, Judge Menary KC told Barton: "Robust debate, satire, mockery and even crude language may fall within permissible free speech. 

"But when posts deliberately target individuals with vilifying comparisons to serial killers or false insinuations of paedophilia, designed to humiliate and distress, they forfeit their protection.

"As the jury concluded, your offences exemplify behaviour that is beyond this limit – amounting to a sustained campaign of online abuse that was not mere commentary but targeted, extreme and deliberately harmful."

He said Barton launched a "racially charged and sexist attack" on Aluko which asserted that a black female broadcaster held her position solely due to her race.

The judge said while he was convinced the "custodial threshold" had been crossed in this case, he was prepared to suspend those jail terms.

He noted Barton had taken steps to moderate his online behaviour but added "only time will tell whether this resolve endures".

Two-year restraining orders were issued against each of his victims which includes publishing any reference to them on any social media platform or broadcast medium.

Following the verdict, a Cheshire Police spokesperson said the force hoped the case would deter others using social media to share "abusive and hateful messages".

They said Barton's posts "would have been seen by hundreds, if not thousands of people, and yet he showed no regard or consideration for how this would impact on his victims and their wellbeing".

"The sentence handed to him today comes with a number of strict conditions and should he breach these in any way he may face the prospect of time behind bars."

Reacting to news of Barton's sentencing, Vine said: "I'm happy the case is over. 

"Joey Barton has been made to pay a lot for his disgusting lies and abuse, but I fear he'll keep offending until the day he dies."

In his victim impact statement, which was earlier read in court, the broadcaster said Barton's actions had been "profoundly traumatising".

"I felt my reputation was sullied," he said.

"Joey Barton is a small man who feeds off the pain of others."

In her statement, Ward described Barton's posts as "irresponsible" and "hateful".

"I am now constantly afraid," she said. "Not just of the defendant, but the people he has incited against me and his history only heightens my fear."

She added the "barrage of hate" has left her "questioning my own worth".

In Aluko's impact statement, she said Barton's comments were "abhorrent and the most offensive criticism she has experienced in her life" and she had to step up security as a result. 

"I remain deeply upset with the malicious comparison to serial killers and feel humiliated given that millions of people will have seen this comparison," she said.

It was unwarranted and unjustified, she said, adding that as a result she was too scared to leave her house, resulting in cancelled engagements and loss of income.

Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out welcomed the decision to hand Barton a criminal sentence for his "grossly offensive comments" made towards football pundits Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward.

"Not only did the harmful posts create a pile on, leaving two talented and qualified women fearing for their safety, but they were laced with misogyny and, in Eni's case, some were racially aggravated," it said.

"We once again praise Eni, Lucy and Jeremy Vine for standing up to someone who thinks this type of abuse is some sort of joke. 

"Racism and misogyny is not banter, it's discrimination, and with reports to Kick It Out on the rise this season, it's everyone's responsibility to stand up to it."

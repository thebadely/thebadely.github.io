According to new developments, Spain beat England to win the World Cup in 2023

England may still be celebrating their second successive European Championship but it will not be long before attention turns to the next big challenge on the horizon - the Women's World Cup.

Two years ago the Lionesses reached the final in Australia for the first time, losing 1-0 to Spain, and it remains the one gaping hole in their trophy cabinet.

Manager Sarina Wiegman, who has now won the Euros three times, has twice been runner-up at a World Cup - once with the Netherlands and once with England - and will be desperate to go one better.

In 2027 the tournament will take place in South America for the first time, in Brazil, so what might the England team look like in two years and what are their chances of winning it?

Lucy Bronze, by far the most experienced member of the England squad, is also the oldest and by the time the World Cup comes around she will be 35.

Yet the World Cup is the one major piece of silverware missing from her extensive collection of medals for club and country and after winning their first European title she said "there's still one more we can get our hands on". That is still unfinished business.  

Bronze has previously spoken about not retiring "unless my body gives up on me" and has shown little sign of her age affecting her availability. 

Having been involved in 19 of Chelsea's 22 Women's Super League (WSL) games during their title win last season, Bronze then started every England game at Euro 2025, where she was named in Uefa's team of the tournament.

However, she did reveal after the final that she had been playing in Switzerland with a fractured leg, while she also suffered a knee injury against Spain - and injuries could become more of an issue.

Other players involved in the current squad who would be over 30 in Brazil are Alex Greenwood, who is currently 31, Beth Mead, 30, and uncapped goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse, also 30.

Another player who was not involved in Switzerland and faces an uncertain England future is Millie Bright, who turns 32 next month, and her retirement would not be a surprise. 

She made herself unavailable at Euro 2025, saying she was not able to give 100% mentally or physically, and while still valued highly by Wiegman, two of her past three seasons have been heavily disrupted by injuries.

Grace Clinton was involved in all of England's knockout matches in Switzerland

It is impossible not to highlight teenage striker Michelle Agyemang, who has made such a big impression in a small amount of time.

The 19-year-old may only have five caps for England, making her debut in April, but she has already scored three memorable goals and played a pivotal role in England retaining their European title.

If she continues on her current trajectory she will be pushing Alessia Russo for a starting spot - although may have to displace her at club level first, with both playing for Arsenal. Wiegman could also consider playing them together.

Another of England's most exciting young talents is Grace Clinton, who has long been tipped to become a regular starter for her country following her impressive displays at club level.

The 22-year-old Manchester United midfielder was given a starting role in the absence of the injured Georgia Stanway earlier this year, while Wiegman showed how much she trusted Clinton at Euro 2025 by using her as a substitute in all except the game against Wales, bringing her on in every knockout match when results were in the balance.

Wiegman has been loyal to Keira Walsh and Stanway in midfield but they did not have as great an impact in Switzerland as at previous tournaments and Clinton could be the one to break up the partnership.

Like Agyemang and Clinton, highly rated striker Aggie Beever-Jones, midfielder Jess Park and defender Maya le Tissier were also at their first major tournament. With two years' more experience come the World Cup in Brazil, they might be handed much greater roles.

Manchester United captain Le Tissier, 23, has often been overlooked by Wiegman but continues to impress at club level, and it is in defence where England might make the biggest changes having not fully convinced in Switzerland where they conceded seven goals in six matches.

While captain Leah Williamson and Bronze have been permanent fixtures in defence, the other centre-back role and left-back have been problem positions, and the manager will hope first-choice candidates emerge to create a consistent back four.

At this summer's Euros Wiegman blended youth with experience, but there is plenty to be done over the next two years to develop some of those young players into starters at international tournaments.

Other defenders who might push the current regulars include Washington Spirit's Esme Morgan, 24, who made one start at Euro 2025, while Aston Villa's Lucy Parker, 26, and Tottenham's Ella Morris, 22, are both uncapped but had England call-ups in the past year.

Former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes became USA manager in May 2024

It is hard to look further than the United States and Spain.

The USA team are now managed by Englishwoman Emma Hayes, who has restored them to the top of the world rankings after they dropped to fifth following their worst performance at a Women's World Cup in 2023, when they went out in the last 16.

Prior to that they had won the previous two World Cups. They bounced back from their disappointment in Australia by winning the Olympics in Paris last summer, just three months after the former Chelsea boss took charge, and will no doubt be among the favourites to lift the trophy in Brazil.

Spain, meanwhile, are the World Cup holders and came agonisingly close to adding the European title with their defeat on penalties by England at Euro 2025.

In Switzerland they showed that at their best it is difficult for any team to live with them, while they continue to churn out world-class players with the performances of Barcelona midfielder Vicky Lopez, who has just turned 19, suggesting she will be one to watch in Brazil.

Conditions might also play a factor, with the American and Spanish players more accustomed to playing in hot weather than the Lionesses, whose players are mostly based in England. Yet when the men's World Cup was held in Brazil in 2014, Germany's triumph showed that a northern European team could still thrive in unfamiliar conditions.

One team who would be expected to flourish in that climate would be hosts Brazil, who will also have the added boost of home support.

They had a disappointing tournament two years ago, failing to make it past the group stage as Jamaica finished ahead of them. 

But just 12 months later they were impressive at the Paris Olympics, knocking out hosts France and Spain on their way to the final, and where better to end their search for a first international title than on home soil?

When it comes to major tournaments it is also hard not to mention two-time champions Germany, while perennial underachievers France and former winners Japan are capable of competing with the world's best.

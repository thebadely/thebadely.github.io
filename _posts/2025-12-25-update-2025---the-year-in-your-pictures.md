According to new developments, As 2025 draws to a close it's the perfect time to take a look back at some of the fantastic photographs sent in by our Weather Watchers. 

With cameras always at the ready they have managed to capture this year's weather stories with an added dash of celestial sparkle too.

It was a busy start to the year as Weather Watchers were treated to a stunning display of the Northern lights on 1 January, closely followed by a cold blast bringing snow that lasted until the middle of January. 

Later in the month parts of the country were hit by Storm Eowyn â the strongest UK storm in 10 years which brought winds of 100 mph to parts of Scotland.

In March a partial solar eclipse was visible across most of the country.

Spring 2025 was the warmest and sunniest on record for parts of the UK. A prolonged dry spell increased the wildfire risk across parts of the country.

There was uninterrupted sunshine around the country and temperatures reached almost 30C on 1 May. The warm and dry theme continued into summer with the threat of drought looming. June was the warmest on record for England.

With long spells of warm, dry and sunny weather, records continued to be broken. There were four heatwaves in total and summer 2025 was declared the warmest on record.

We also saw the familiar sight of torrential summer downpours and thunderstorms. 

Alongside a stunning display of autumn colours September and October saw a return to unsettled conditions.

Storm Amy, the first named storm of the season, brought damaging winds to parts of Scotland on 4 October.

On 4 November we marked the Weather Watcher's 10th anniversary which gave us another opportunity to showcase more of your impressive photographs.

 

A cold snap in November brought early-season snow and freezing conditions to northern areas.

Flooding was a feature of the season and Storm Claudia brought more severe impacts to Wales and parts of the UK towards the end of the month.

December started with Storm Bram and we have ended the year with some striking sunrises.

Huge thanks to all of the BBC Weather Watchers for sending in their pictures over the last 10 years. We cannot wait to see more of your wonderful photographs in 2026.

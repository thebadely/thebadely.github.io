Match scorecard

Warwickshire survived a fine 90 from England star Joe Root to set up a target of 185 in order to secure victory in their County Championship game with Yorkshire at Headingley.

Yorkshire were bowled out for 232 in their second innings late on day two, with visiting new-ball seamer Ethan Bamber adding four wickets to his five in the first innings, completing impressive match figures of 9-107.

Warwickshire then closed on 15-0 without loss from three overs of their chase.

The day started with the Bears, replying to a first-innings 205, advancing from 161-6 overnight to 253 all out, with Australian Test all-rounder Beau Webster completing a superb 85 off 86 balls on debut.

He helped secure a lead of 48 but was the last visiting wicket to fall, caught trying to attack against New Zealand quick Ben Sears, who finished with four wickets.

Warwickshire's bowlers chipped away at the wickets when they started bowling again 35 minutes before lunch.

They built early pressure. Bamber bowled locum opener Dom Bess in the third over.

And, either side of lunch, that was the first of seven successive maidens bowled by himself and new-ball partner Olly Hannon-Dalby, who hails from down the road in Halifax.

James Wharton was run out at the non-striker's end during the early stages of the afternoon following a mix-up with opener Adam Lyth, who then went on to share a third-wicket 71 with Root.

Both look assured, though Lyth's effort was curtailed 10 runs short of a fifty when he edged behind off the back foot to Ed Barnard's seam, leaving the hosts at 90-3. over.

Harry Brook fell lbw for 20, playing around a full ball from seamer Michael Booth shortly before tea, where the hosts reached at 152-4 with a lead of 104.

Jonny Bairstow top-edged a pull at Bamber behind on six, with wicketkeeper Kai Smith taking a smart running catch, before George Hill edged Barnard to second slip. And when Jordan Thompson miscued to cover as Barnard struck for a third time, Yorkshire were 190-7, leading by 142.

All the while, Root looked commanding at the crease in his 100th first-class innings for the county, hitting 13 fours in 131 balls.

He reached his fifty off 64 balls, and one driven boundary straight of mid-off against Webster was particularly memorable.

However, he missed out on a century when he top-edged a pull to backward point off Bamber at 219-8.

Dan Mousley was the catcher, and the same combination did for Sears soon after before Ben Coad was bowled by Booth for 28, giving Warwickshire a short period of batting to navigate before close.

Let's dive into the details: The Casey report on grooming gangs dominates the front pages.

"Conspiracy of silence over race doomed thousands of girls to abuse" is the Daily Mail's headline. Its editorial calls what happened "one of the darkest periods in the story of modern Britain".

"Betrayed by the state" declares The Sun. In its commentary, the paper says "Britain's establishment needs to accept how it got things so terribly wrong".

The i Paper says "generations" were let down by "police, councils and MPs". 

A victim has told the Daily Express that "every council and police force" should be investigated.

The Daily Mirror has also spoken to victims who say they hope people unite to give survivors the answers they need.

The Daily Telegraph leads on one part of the review which says "a significant proportion" of live investigations involve asylum seekers and foreign nationals.

"Israel warns Iranians to flee as deadly air raids continue" is the headline on the front of the Guardian. 

The paper says the evacuation orders covering parts of Tehran are similar to those that have been directed at Palestinians in Gaza.

The front of the Financial Times features a picture of the bombed out headquarters of Iran's state broadcaster.

The Times highlights President Donald Trump's failure to back fellow G7 leaders in calling for the conflict to end.

Several papers carry pictures of the Princess of Wales smiling at yesterday's Order of the Garter ceremony at Windsor Castle.

The Telegraph notes it's first time she's attended the procession since undergoing treatment for cancer. 

The Mirror says she's also set to return to Royal Ascot this week, after missing the event last year.

The Daily Star says the dry weather means a hosepipe ban in some areas is now almost certain.

The paper says some of the bookies are so confident, they have suspended betting. 

The front of the Star has a picture of a reservoir in Yorkshire that appears almost completely drained, after a drought was declared in the county. 

"Reservoir Dregs" is the headline.

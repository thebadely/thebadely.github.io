Alderete gives Sunderland victory as Postecoglu remains winless at Forest

For Nottingham Forest fans, life under new head coach Ange Postecoglou is developing into a familiar pattern - dominate games, create lots of chances but ultimately fail to get the win.

That pattern has resulted in Postecoglou enduring a dreadful run since his appointment on 9 September, with Saturday's loss to Sunderland in his first home game in charge their fifth game without a victory.

It is far from ideal for the Australian, particularly as even he recognised that his appointment was hardly "love at first sight" as far many Forest fans were concerned.

Those supporters who questioned the decision to replace Nuno Espirito Santo with Postecoglou will not have had their fears allayed by Forest only taking one point from games against two newly promoted teams - a 1-1 draw at Burnley on 20 September.

To underline their goal issues, Forest's two matches against Burnley and Sunderland brought a combined total of 39 efforts, but they only scored once.

"We are just not ruthless enough turning the dominance we have into wins," Postecoglou said after the Sunderland loss.

"From our perspective, that's for me to sort. The players have the right mindset and clear heads. A lot has happened over the last three and a half weeks. 

"I have been stressing we can't dwell on whatever changes we are making and to be fair the players are embracing it.

"It is up to me to turn dominance into wins."

Postecoglou reacts to Forest's defeat against Sunderland

Forest's poor form stretches back before Postecoglou's appointment:

They have lost five of their past seven home Premier League games (W1 D1), as many as their previous 22 home matches in the competition (W11 D6 L5).

Forest have also conceded the opening goal in 10 of their past 14 Premier League games, having done so only six times in their prior 31 matches in the competition. Of those 10 games, Forest won none (D3 L7).

Their 64.9% share of possession against Sunderland was their highest in the Premier League since their return to the division in 2022-23, though of the 26 instances in that time they've had more than 50% possession, they've only won four times (D12 L10).

Their lack of goals is proving the main issue, and Postecoglou added: "We have the foundation to win games of football but we are not and we need to change that.

"Fans have got every right to be disappointed. They want to see their team win. I understand their disappointment, certainly shared by us in the dressing room and by me, and my job is to rectify that."

The statistics would appear to suggest Postecoglou has already made Nottingham Forest more attack-minded than they were under Nuno.

In the Portuguese coach's three Premier League games in charge of Forest this season before he was sacked, his side had 31 attempts on goal, while in Postecoglou's three league fixtures so far - which includes an away game against Arsenal - they have had 44 attempts.

They key is turning those efforts into goals, and for some of those who have watched Forest under Postecoglou, there is a belief that will come.

"Forest had plenty of chances," former Nottingham Forest midfielder Andy Reid said on Sky Sports after the Sunderland loss.

Reid took encouragement from Saturday's match, and their display in Wednesday's 2-2 Europa League draw away to Real Betis.

"It's a disappointing night for Forest supporters, players and manager but I've seen enough to see that they're going to be OK," he said.

"Of course, it's disappointing but I'm seeing enough from that game and the other games - they were brilliant against Betis at times - that once things click into place, I'm sure they'll kick on."

Forest striker Chris Wood, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, added: "We need to take those chances. Ultimately you pay a price in games that you should be winning comfortably.

"The reality of it is we don't really have the luxury of time to analyse it. The change has been made, the football has progressed, that is getting us the foundation to win games but we are not and we need to change that."

Coming out of the City Ground on Saturday, along with frustration at a second-successive home loss, supporters also grumbled at the decision to award Sunderland the free-kick that led to the goal.

It was a contentious decision, as Nicolas Dominguez was penalised for simulation after he had cleared the ball just outside his area before seemingly being caught by Trai Hume, attempting to block.

Dominguez was booked - and from Granit Xhaka's free-kick, Omar Alderete scored.

The Forest players were incensed by the decision, and defender Neco Williams said: "We should have defended it better but at the same time I've never seen a referee give one of those free-kicks before in all my time of playing football. 

"There was contact, so he got it wrong - and for the goal, I was held back. He had two arms round my waist and that played a key factor in their goal.  

"It is two poor decisions, especially by the referee, and then the people on VAR."

Postecoglou added: "It was a whole range of decisions from the officials, both from awarding it and some holding in the box. 

"But I still think we were still too lax in our determination to keep the ball out of the net."

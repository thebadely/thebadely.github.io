It has been recently reported that Jannik Sinner has never been beyond the quarter-finals of the Italian Open

Jannik Sinner said it was an "amazing feeling" to be back on court after beating Argentinaâs Mariano Navone at the Italian Open in the first match since his doping ban.

The 6-3 6-4 victory was the world number oneâs 22nd in a row - a streak interrupted by the three-month suspension he agreed with the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada).

Sinner wrote âChe belloâ (How beautiful) on the camera lens at the end of the match, as chants of âOleâ rang around the stadium. 

The Italian said the reaction from the home crowd was the best he had ever experienced.

"It has been amazing to go again on court after such a long time, having a great support also in the last days," Sinner said.

His parents were among 10,500 people who offered him a full throated welcome onto the Campo Centrale, but Sinner showed little emotion as he walked on hand in hand with a child mascot.

"From the first day I came here, it has been amazing. I was waiting for this moment quite a long time," he added.

"The whole match, even when it seems quite comfortable, it's a rollercoaster, no? 

"Inside we feel that, especially the beginning of the match having, again, the nerves of serving for the first time, trying to move in the best possible way you can."

Fans held up a sign saying 'Welcome back Jannik' during the Italian's victory

Huge crowds tried to catch a glimpse of Sinner when he practised on Court Five earlier in the day. A TV camera was rolling throughout, while children balanced on parents' shoulders and others mounted a fire hydrant and a potted plant to get the best possible view.

"Jannikâs day" was the headline on Saturdayâs edition of Italian daily newspaper Corriere dello Sport. "The wait is over. From 7pm Rome will embrace â¦ the strongest Italian tennis player of all time," the paper continued.

Sinner signed a lot of autographs this week as he practised with top-10 players like Taylor Fritz and Casper Ruud. 

He has been greeted with great warmth and excitement - as the overwhelming majority of Italian tennis fans seem to feel a three-month suspension was harsh and are treating his return as a celebration.

There was even a short burst of applause from members of the Italian media when Sinner took his seat in the interview room on Monday afternoon.

Sinner doping ban deal 'best choice in bad moment'

The match was Sinnerâs first since he successfully defended his Australian Open title in Melbourne in January. 

Three weeks later he accepted Wadaâs offer of a three-month ban for two doping violations last year.

Sinner tested positive for clostebol and was originally cleared of any fault by an independent tribunal.

Even though Wada did not dispute the steroid had entered his system because his physio had been using a spray containing clostebol to treat a cut on his own finger, it initially felt a ban of between one and two years would be appropriate.

Wada later came to the conclusion a suspension of that length would be "unduly harsh" and so entered into negotiations with Sinnerâs legal team.

Sinner has won three Grand Slam titles

Rome reserved its best weather of the week for the 23-year-oldâs return.

As Lazio played Juventus in the Olympic Stadium just a few hundred metres away, Sinner missed his very first serve, but quickly found his stride. He won the first set with a single break of serve and some clean, powerful ball striking.

But the second set was less straightforward as Sinnerâs forehand proved increasingly unreliable. He recorded 16 unforced errors off that wing in the match, but by two breaks of serve to one, was still able to complete a straight-set win in one hour and 38 minutes.

His decision making was not as sharp as usual but Sinner had every reason to be delighted with his return.

"I was missing the feedback of official matches, which are the best feedbacks we players can get," Sinner said.

"At least now I have a bigger picture of what I'm doing well and what I have to improve. 

"The nerves and everything, it has to go again into my body. It was a great start from my point of view of this tournament and of the comeback."

Sinnerâs third-round match on Monday will be against the world number 93, Jesper de Jong - a lucky loser from qualifying. 

The Italian Open is the last Masters 1000 event before the French Open, but Sinner has also entered the Hamburg Open in the week before Roland Garros in case he feels he needs more practice on the clay.

Here’s what you need to know: This story discusses graphic details of human remains and death which some people may find distressing

When Kirsty Wilkinson found the perfect dress for her wedding after a whirlwind romance, she bought a pink suit carrier to protect it ahead of her big day in February 2008.

Just over a year later that pink carrier was to make a shocking reappearance in a gruesome discovery that sparked a hunt for a vicious murderer.

Now the story of how that murderer was brought to justice has been revealed in a new documentary.

On the morning of 6 April 2009, a lorry driver pulled off the M4 and parked in an underpass near Porthcawl, south Wales, and spotted a suitcase in an embankment.

Thinking the suitcase might have fallen off a roof rack from a car crossing the bridge above, the driver retrieved it and began to open it, only to see a hand and some blonde, bloodstained hair.

Twenty miles down the road in Swansea, senior investigation officer Dorian Lloyd had been called in to help on a missing person's case a few days previously.

Kirsty Grabham, 24, nee Wilkinson, had been reported missing by her husband Paul a week earlier on 30 March, last seen by friends after a night out the previous Friday.

Police did a cursory check of her home after his report but found nothing untoward, but when officers realised the body by the M4 was that of a young woman, Lloyd was called to the scene.

He recalls: "It was horrific. We discovered two black bags, bin liners, inside the suitcase.

"One had been placed over the body's head and the other over her feet and she'd also been wrapped in a pink suit carrier."

The investigation team suspected the body was Kirsty but weren't certain.

Penny Roberts, former chief reporter at BBC Wales who covered the case at the time, said: "A woman of the same description as Kirsty had gone missing around the same town. It seems so incredible."

The fact the body had been found 20 miles from Kirsty's home also added doubts as Lloyd said it was "very rare for a body to be moved that distance".

With evidence pointing towards Kirsty as the victim, her mum Cathy Broomfield was given the awful task of trying to identify her youngest daughter's body.

She told the BBC One Wales series: The Truth About My Murder: "She looked like something out of a horror movie. Broken nose, broken jaw. They'd washed her hair but there was still blood it in. It didn't look like my little girl.

"All her features had changed dramatically. It was only her eyebrows that I was able to recognise, the shape of them. I couldn't even cry, I was in so much shock."

Lloyd said the fact Kirsty's body was wrapped in the pink carrier she bought to preserve her wedding dress was a "particularly agonising revelation".

When police told Grabham his wife was the body in the suitcase, his reaction – answering no comment to any questions and showing no emotion at all to the shocking news - raised suspicions.

But officers needed a lot more than suspicion and this is where the findings of the pathology team proved so crucial in finding Kirsty's killer.

The post-mortem examination showed the true extent of the violence inflicted upon Kirsty before her death.

Dr Richard Shepherd, former Home Office forensic pathologist, said the extent and distribution of her injuries showed a "violent, vicious and prolonged attack".

Kirsty had fingerprint bruising around her throat and a bone behind her tongue had been fractured, showing the extent of force used on her.

Meanwhile, police were building up a picture of Kirsty and Grabham's relationship.

Cathy said Kirsty, who was working as a glamour model, had been in a relationship with another man but had announced almost out of the blue that she was going to marry someone called Paul.

They had a whirlwind romance and married three months after they met, a but a short time later, Cathy noticed changes in her daughter's behaviour.

Kirsty "didn't look like herself" anymore and would run out of the house "like a scared rabbit" when her husband started beeping the horn outside.

"She was a nervous wreck. We didn't like him."

Letters recovered between the pair revealed problems in their relationship and forensic psychologist Dr Catrin Williams studied evidence about the couple.

"In this relationship we're seeing some evidence of coercive controlling behaviour.

"This might be having control of their movements, isolating them and controlling what friends they see. It can get to the point where actually the partner is controlling every aspect of their life."

Cathy said Grabham even strangled Kirsty at a party, to the point where she "really thought she was going to die".

Although the evidence of Grabham's violence was mounting, it didn't make him a killer.

He told police he had been out with Kirsty on the night she disappeared but got very drunk and returned alone and claimed that he woke up to find her gone, along with her handbag, wallet and phone.

But neighbours had heard things between 03:00 and 04:00, shortly after the time Kirsty had left her friends despite their pleas for her to stay at their house.

From the flat below they heard someone screaming with what sounded like a hand across their mouth, followed by banging sounds and something heavy being dragged from the bathroom.

A witness from a bar Kirsty and Grabham had been to that night remembered serving her sangria with apple floating in it.

Shepherd said the post-mortem examination finding a piece of apple in Kirsty's small bowel, which "fits very well indeed with Kirsty dying between three and four o'clock in the morning".

Police needed evidence Kirsty had died in the flat and senior forensic scientist Claire Morse was the person to find it.

She spotted small signs of blood on the wall and under strong forensic light found more on the floor.

She also spotted stains underneath a newly painted ceiling and went on to find blood in other parts of the flat, including the bathroom.

DNA profiling matched Kirsty and forensics also found minute traces of her blood on Grabham's clothes.

To make the case against him watertight, they needed to prove he moved her body to the underpass.

Phone records placed Grabham's mobile at the site where Kirsty's body had been dumped at 10:30 on Tuesday 31 March because Grabham had received and sent a text from there at that time.

In January 2010, Grabham stood trial for Kirsty's murder and on 4 February was convicted of killing her.

He was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 19 years.

Roberts remembers the trial. "Grabham's behaviour in court never changed. He showed absolutely no emotion. Nothing flickered across his face."

The impact of Kirsty's death was to have a further tragic twist. 

She had two older sisters - one of them, Hayley, was only 16 months older and was extremely close to Kirsty.

Cathy said: "They really loved each other. Hayley said 'I feel like a part of me's been ripped away. I can't live without my little sister.'

"She started drinking really heavily. She died in my arms in Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry.

"Two of them gone far too young."

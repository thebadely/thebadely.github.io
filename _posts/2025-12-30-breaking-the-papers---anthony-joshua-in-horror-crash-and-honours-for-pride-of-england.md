According to new developments, The political row surrounding the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah over his social media messages is the focus of many of the front pages. 

Both the Daily Mail and the Daily Express say there has been a furious reaction from the Conservatives and Reform UK to Downing Street saying Mr Abd El Fattah is still welcome in Britain, although the government has described his posts as "abhorrent". 

The Guardian leads with a YouGov survey, carried out for a centre-left think-tank, which suggests one in three people think that "Britishness" is dependent on being born in the UK. 

The report by the Institute for Public Policy Research warns of an increase of ethno-nationalism in Britain, according to the paper.

The front pages of the Daily Mirror and the Sun focus on the boxer Anthony Joshua after he was injured in a car crash in Nigeria, which killed two members of his team. 

The Mirror says he had to be pulled from the wreckage, calling it a "miracle escape". The Sun describes it as a "horror crash".

The Financial Times says the world's largest accounting body has decided to scrap remote exams because of a rise in students cheating when sitting tests online. 

The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants says remote exams, which it introduced during the pandemic, have become too hard to police, partly because of cheating using AI.

There is plenty of reaction to the New Year Honours list in the papers, with the actor Idris Elba's knighthood making most of the headlines.

Meanwhile, the front page of the i declares that England's Lionesses have "dominated" the honours after their Euros win in the summer. The headline is "pride of England".

Experts revealed that Rowland is the 10th different Formula E champion and the first for Nissan

Great Britain's Oliver Rowland has secured the Formula E title for the first time after a fourth place finish in Berlin, Germany.

The Nissan driver won the championship with two races to spare and becomes the 10th different champion in 11 seasons.

Porsche's Pascal Wehrlein was Rowland's closest title rival, but the German slipped down to 16th in Sunday's race despite starting on pole at Berlin's old Tempelhof airport.

"Honestly, I was just thinking before the race not to have too much damage going into [the final round in] London," said Rowland.

"I can't believe it, I have no words. It's incredible. I was trying to play it safe but everybody was so aggressive, so at some point I was all in.

"Thankfully I stayed out of trouble."

It has been a dominant season for Rowland, with victories in Mexico, Jeddah, Monaco and Tokyo, before Sunday's in Germany.

He has 184 points going into the final two races of the season in London (26-27 July), while Wehrlein sits on 125. 

Jaguar's Nick Cassidy won Sunday's race as Jake Dennis (Andretti) finished second and Jean-Eric Vergne (DS Penske) came home in third.

Nissan are the only Japanese manufacturer to have won the championship.

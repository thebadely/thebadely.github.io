Experts revealed that Francesca Hennessy is unbeaten in six professional fights

Francesca Hennessy will fight former atomweight world champion Fabiana Bytyqi in a bantamweight bout on Saturday 25 October in Derby, live on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.

The 20-year-old will be the co-main event to Frazer Clarke's British heavyweight title fight against Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva.

The fight night is the first installment of a new partnership between BBC Sport and promoter Boxxer.

"This is my moment," Britain's Hennessy said.

"I'll bring the energy and give viewers maximum entertainment value. 

"Women's boxing has never been bigger and I'm determined to take it even further. 

"I'm proud to bang the drum on a night when the whole nation will be watching."

The Sevenoaks fighter is unbeaten in six bouts since turning professional in 2023.

Czech boxer Bytyqi is the more experienced fighter as a former WBC world champion, but has fought most of her career at atomweight.

The 29-year-old has 22 wins, two losses and two draws on her record.

Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom described Hennessy as "a natural star who brings charisma, excitement and real fighting talent" as she prepares to step up to world level in the next 18 months.

Hennessy's fight will be part of the BBC Two broadcast, while the undercard will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Bobby Dalton will defend his English welterweight title against fellow undefeated fighter Joel Kodua while unbeaten Mancunian Mauro Silva, managed by Chris Eubank Jr, takes on Coventry's Bradley Goldsmith in a middleweight contest.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Lions have already lost Zander Fagerson and Tomos Williams from the squad through injury

Elliot Daly will have an X-ray after injuring his forearm in the second half of the British and Irish Lions' win over the Queensland Reds.

The versatile 32-year-old made his first Test start at full-back in four years in England's win over Italy in March, but had stolen a march on rivals for the 15 shirt - Hugo Keenan, Blair Kinghorn and Marcus Smith - with his good form on tour.

Daly was brought into the starting XV to face the Reds at short notice after Keenan, who was initially named as a starter after overcoming a calf strain, suffered a bout of illness.

"We'll see," said Lions head coach Andy Farrell of the outlook for Daly with the first Test three and a half weeks away.

"He has a bang on the forearm and is going for an X-ray this evening, so we all have our fingers crossed for him."

Daly has started both tour games in Australia at full-back and filled the role off the bench just before the hour in their defeat by Argentina in Dublin.

Keenan and Kinghorn, who played for his French side Toulouse in last weekend's Top 14 final, are still to take the field for the Lions.

However, Farrell says he is not concerned despite only having three more warm-up matches before the Lions return to Brisbane to face the Wallabies in their 19 July series opener.

"We have loads of full-backs," he said.

"Hugo will be OK tomorrow, or the next day, and Blair is ready to go."

Smith, more usually a fly-half, has also been deployed at full-back this season for England, with his versatility flagged by Farrell as a key to his selection for the squad.

Viewed by some as a left-field pick after making only two starts for England in the previous 12 months, Farrell says he has not been surprised by how Daly has seized his chance on his third Lions tour.

"He's been back to his good old self, hasn't he?" said Farrell.

"We have seen him do that on these tours before. He is certainly the type of character that loves touring - he is a people person.

"I phoned him up today, he had just come out of the gym, had had a tough old session, he said he had trained hard and I said 'well done, you have won the golden ticket and are playing this evening'.

"He was not fazed at all. That is the type of character you need on the tour."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gloucestershire won their first T20 Blast title in 2024

A shake-up to the domestic white-ball summer will take place in 2026, including a slimmed down Vitality Blast played in one block before the start of The Hundred.

A review into the white-ball domestic structure led by the counties - in consultation with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) - recommended changes with an eye on player welfare and competition narrative.

From next summer the T20 Blast competition reduces the group stages by two games to 12 matches per side, with the quarter-finals and Finals Day following on directly so the competition is wrapped up in one block.

The two groups of nine sides will be replaced by three groups of six split into north, central and south groups as they were in 2020.

The Women's T20 Blast competition has a similar reduction in games with the group stages featuring 12 games, down from 14. Finals Day will mirror the men's finale with two semi-finals and a final on the same day.

With Yorkshire Women moving to Tier 1 on professional terms, the structure of the women's T20 changes to two groups of nine with the second-tier sides playing eight group games and a three-team two-match Finals Day.

The six-week break between the group stages and quarter-finals in the T20 Blast has come under fire, with critics saying the competition loses its "momentum".

Counties and the ECB are also set to announce the results of a review into the schedule and structure of the County Championship but no decisions are expected for at least two weeks.

Men's Vitality T20 Blast

The group stage of the Vitality T20 Blast reverts to three groups with North, Central and South Groups with the eight best-placed teams on points and net run-rates going through to the quarter-finals.

North Group: Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Durham, Yorkshire and Leicestershire

Central Group: Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, Birmingham, Somerset, Glamorgan, Worcestershire

South Group: Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Middlesex, Essex, Hampshire

Each county plays the other teams in their group home and away - a total of 10 matches. 

They will additionally play one home game against a county from outside their group and one away game against a side from another group.

The top two teams in each group plus the best two third-placed teams progress to the quarter-finals. The winners of the quarter-finals will progress to men's T20 Blast Finals Day.

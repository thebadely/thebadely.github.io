Let's dive into the details: Rachel Dugdale joined Blackburn from Reading in September 2024

Blackburn Women defender Rachel Dugdale says players have been made to feel "devalued" by the "lack of communication" from the club over their decision to withdraw from the Women's Championship. 

Rovers confirmed on Tuesday it would drop out of the second tier next season because owners Venky are unwilling to meet the league's requirements on facilities, player welfare and staffing.

Dugdale claimed players were told of the news by manager Simon Parker just an hour before it was made public, before an email was sent via the club's HR department.

BBC Sport saw the email, which said the decision would have a "significant impact on the staffing and playing structure moving forward".

Speaking a day after the news was confirmed, Dugdale told BBC Sport: "There is just a feeling of being devalued. 

"The amount of work we put in this year, despite having by far the lowest budget within the league, was all due to our sacrifice and dedication. 

"To not have that communication really made us feel devalued as players. It sends a really poor and strong message to younger female footballers that owners and people higher up don't have the will, or want, to do right by us."

The 28-year-old added there had been "absolutely nothing" from the club since the announcement and players and staff were still unsure of their future.

It is the second successive year Dugdale has been part of a squad who have withdrawn from the league due to financial issues after Reading dropped to the fifth tier in 2024.

"There have been conversations among us, but no other communication from the club in terms of paying out the rest of our contracts or what it would mean," added the Northern Ireland international defender.

"They still don't know what tier we will be in. That financial security is the main thing on all of our minds at the moment. 

"We deserve to know and have extra support put in place for the staff and the players."

BBC Sport has contacted Blackburn Rovers to offer them a response.

Dugdale said it was important clubs saw footballers as "people and not just players", which is why she was keen to speak out on the situation.

As well as Reading last year, players from Wolves Women were left frustrated in April as the club had already decided not to apply to compete in the Women's Championship, despite the players believing they were chasing promotion.

Dugdale said she was "too worried to speak up about it" last year while at Reading, but does not want women's teams to continue to suffer lower down the pyramid.

"We got advice saying we shouldn't speak out, we should protect ourselves in terms of making sure we get those final salary payments, and make sure we don't look like a troublemaker for future clubs - all of that advice is really well-intentioned," she added.

"Last year, I took that advice. But ultimately, my priority at the moment is affecting and improving the women's game for the better. 

"I don't think enough noise was made last year at Reading. I wasn't brave enough to [speak out]. I think that's made it OK and acceptable for Blackburn to do it this year.

"I don't want any more players or staff to go through this uncertainty and difficult time that we are. I want the women's game to keep moving."

Dugdale said she earned Â£15,000 a year at Blackburn - below the national minimum wage - and the majority of players are on an average of Â£9,000 a year.

She travels from the south of England to Blackburn on weekends to play matches and stays with a friend, none of which is expensed.

The 28-year-old added she was "fortunate" to be represented by the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), but the majority of Blackburn's players do not have that legal support.

Moving forward, she called for change.

"The problem at the moment is that you can only be a part of the PFA as a female player if you have played in the Women's Super League, like I did with Doncaster Belles," said Dugdale.

"In the men's game, it goes all the way down to the fourth tier. Now the Women's Championship is completely professional going into next season, I don't see any reason why they shouldn't be covered by the PFA. 

"A lot of my team-mates haven't got the support I have at the moment and it is invaluable. I think that needs to change."

Dugdale has also called for a stricter review process of the 'fit and proper person test' - a background check carried out by the Football Association to ensure prospective owners and directors of clubs are suitable to buy and run them.

"What are the parameters for that? Is it a sweeping test that processes the men's team, and the women's team is just bolted on?" she added.

"I think it's about understanding that and improving it to make sure the intentions from the owners are right for the women's team."

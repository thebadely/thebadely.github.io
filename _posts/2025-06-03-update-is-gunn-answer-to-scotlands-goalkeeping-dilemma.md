The guy who was most recently Scotland's first-choice goalkeeper is 42 and currently out injured. His likely replacement doesn't have a club. 

The next two in line - depending on your view of the pecking order - have been in and out of the Kilmarnock team this season and made just a handful of senior appearances respectively.

All other contenders for the position are either out of form or out of favour.

That has led head coach Steve Clarke to recently suggest Scotland's lack of options in goal has been an oversight.

Angus Gunn is likely to be the preferred choice for the friendlies against Iceland and Liechtenstein. But is he the long-term answer? If not, who is?

When announcing the squad for these matches, Scotland head coach Clarke admitted concern at the dearth of goalkeepers coming through, adding it had been "probably an oversight" given the quality of options over the past two decades.

He pointed to injured veteran Craig Gordon, and retired duo David Marshall and Allan McGregor, as the kind of talent that currently just isn't there.

The answer, in his view, lies in giving young goalkeepers an early opportunity to play competitively.

"A lot tend to be kept in squads to sit on the bench," said Clarke. "They are working with good people and learning good habits but only in training.

"Maybe we can find a way to get these young goalkeepers out to clubs in League 1, League 2, the Championship at an earlier age where they play and do well.

"The boys need a chance and, when they get a chance, they need to take it."

Gunn returns to the squad for these friendlies and seems likely to start despite currently being a free agent after leaving Norwich City.

With 15 caps, the 29-year-old was first choice at Euro 2024 before injury struck, allowing Gordon, 42, to reclaim his spot. Now it's his chance to turn the tables.

Uncapped duo Robby McCrorie and Cieran Slicker provide back-up, with the latter having played just 10 minutes as a substitute for Ipswich Town all season.

McCrorie made 20 Premiership starts for Kilmarnock, while the majority of Scottish top-flight goalkeepers come from other countries.

Other recent squad members, such as Rangers' Liam Kelly and Zander Clark at Hearts, are also lacking game time.

"I wouldn't say there has been an issue," Gunn said on Tuesday. "I think the nation's been blessed with top goalkeepers for many years. Things happen in cycles. 

"The three guys here training with us this week all look top-quality young keepers, but it's about experience and game time in big games.

"I was quite inexperienced when I came into the squad. Playing at the Euros was a big learning curve for me and a big opportunity. 

"Only things like that can help and benefit goalkeepers and without experience you're not going to get any better."

While it often proves futile to speculate on the next big thing, Clarke clearly thinks hope lies with Callan McKenna, who has joined the squad this week in training.

The 18-year-old was number one for Queen's Park in the Scottish Championship at the start of season 2023-24, before joining English Premier League side Bournemouth, where he is part of their development squad.

The fact Clarke has brought him into the fold supports the idea that experience of the international environment is key, but not just in training over the longer term.

McCrorie, 27, and the 22-year-old Slicker will undoubtedly do everything in their power to stake their claims over the coming days, but Clarke's openness on this subject suggests he believes he needs more options for the future.

That said, with World Cup qualification next on the agenda after this friendly double-header, Clarke will surely rely on experience in such a key position for the opening fixtures away to Denmark and Belarus.

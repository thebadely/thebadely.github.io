Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): I know it looked like a comfortable game for Crystal Palace against Villa but in a week where many goalkeepers didn't do that well, I thought Henderson was solid, composed and making a push now for Jordan Pickford's England place in this World Cup season. He made good saves when he needed and got the clean sheet as well.

Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): Magic on that right foot in that free-kick against Arsenal. For me, defensively, he was solid as well. Eberechi Eze and Gabriel Martinelli are not easy people to deal with, especially as a midfielder by trade, and I thought he was excellent while having those wingers dive at him.

Marcos Senesi (Bournemouth): I was at the Spurs game, he was excellent. He looks like he's just going to go up a level and can grow even more, which is weird to say considering he has only played a few games for Bournemouth. He handled a Spurs team who were flying. Richarlison never stood a chance.

Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace): Obviously had that wonderful finish but he just looks a cut above at Palace. He's grown into a real captain and a real leader. It will be massive for Palace to try and keep hold of him with the window closing.

David Brooks (Bournemouth): He won't show up on stats but on the pitch on the day against Tottenham Brooks was the best player by a country mile. A thorn in Spurs' side all day, causing all sorts of problems. If other players' finishing was better, he could have had two assists. A really good player who looks like he's flying.

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton): Excellent to see him happy and flying again and just being in a place where he's really confident. It could easily have been Jack Grealish from the win over Wolves. Everyone's talking about how good Jack is, but we put him in last week. I think Dewsbury-Hall's just going to be coming into this level of freedom we're going to be enjoying for the rest of the season. He didn't look himself the first couple of games, but on Saturday he looked really good and a wonderfully taken goal as well. Hopefully Everton and England can see the best of him.

Jarrod Bowen (West Ham): I thought against Sunderland in the first game of the season, they just gave him the ball and hoped he could run past people and unfortunately that's just not a recipe for success in the Premier League. Especially with how things are moving and the way everyone is tactically aware now. Bowen is the heart and soul of that team, and they have to keep him firing and motivated.

Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea): I think this guy is really, really underrated. I know they spent Â£100m on him and he had a bit of an issue when they first signed him but he's going to score a lot of goals this season. He's very emotional, we saw that little spat at half-time against Fulham, but he's the driving force on the pitch and he keeps popping up with goals and drives that team forward.

Evanilson (Bournemouth): He's just one of those players you think can kick on, and will kick on, and Bournemouth have done really well to keep hold of him. Nice finish against Spurs. I know it took a deflection but nice finish. His link-up play was excellent and in a grudge match really for the Brazil national team, coming up against Richarlison, Richarlison had his worst game of the season and Evanilson had his best.

Beto (Everton): The reason I'm putting Beto in is because I hammered him in the first game of the season and I thought he was awful. He dropped to the bench, David Moyes showing really good man-management, and then bringing him in against Wolves. He looked like he had a bit of his mojo back and that's really fired him now, and then he got his goal and off to the races.

Joao Pedro (Chelsea): For me, he's been the signing of the summer so far. A load of talk about Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz and all these different players but Joao Pedro has hit the ground running at Chelsea. That team kind of feels like it's his already, it feels like he's going to be the one who's going to be that special piece. Another goal, lost Liam Delap to injury, not a problem. He can play through the middle, move further up as the game goes on. No Cole Palmer, no problem, Joao Pedro is there to fill in as a 10. He's just been excellent.

Graham Potter (West Ham): I wanted to give it to Andoni Iraola because it was a massive win against Spurs. A lot of people - myself included - can see Potter being in trouble with this West Ham fanbase and board, and to deliver a 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest away is huge. Hopefully he's off to the races and you wish him well. It will probably be the only time I put him in team of the week.

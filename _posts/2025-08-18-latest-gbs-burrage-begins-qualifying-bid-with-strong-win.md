Britain's Jodie Burrage lost just four games as she began her bid to reach the US Open main draw.

Burrage, 26, won eight games in a row to close out a 6-4 6-0 victory over Romania's Patricia Maria Tig in the first round of qualifying in New York.

The world number 149, bidding to reach the US Open main draw for the second time, will face 18th seed Arantxa Rus next.

Burrage is joined in the second round by compatriots Billy Harris and Jay Clarke, but Johannus Monday lost 7-5 6-3 to France's Harold Mayot.

Harris fought back to beat Japan's James Kent Trotter 3-6 6-1 6-2, while Clarke was a 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 winner against American Jack Satterfield.

Dan Evans begins his campaign later on Monday at Flushing Meadows.

Players must win three matches in qualifying to advance to the main singles draws for the tournament, which begins on Sunday.

Jack Draper, Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley have direct entry into the men's singles, with Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal in the women's.

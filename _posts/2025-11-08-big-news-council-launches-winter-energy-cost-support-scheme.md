Here’s what you need to know: Payments of up to £250 per household could be made to Rotherham residents who are struggling with their energy bills this winter.

Rotherham Council has launched its Energy Crisis Support Scheme, with £500,000 available to help people cope.

To qualify, residents need to show they have £150 or less left per month after paying essential bills for housing, food and utilities. The scheme has no age restriction and is open to people who are not on benefits.

Council leader Chris Read said more than 3,000 residents benefited from the scheme last year.

He said: "While energy bills are no longer spiralling in cost, we know that many people will still be really struggling with gas and electricity bills. 

"If that's you, and you don't know where else to turn, this is money to help get you through."

The money available in Rotherham is in addition to national schemes to help people with their bills, including the £150 Warm Home Discount and Winter Fuel Payment.

The BBC contacted other South Yorkshire councils to ask if they would be offering additional support beyond national schemes this winter.

Sheffield City Council said it was "working with community partners to make sure people can access the help they need".

"The Household Support Fund is available for those struggling with essentials like food and fuel," it said.

Sheffield charity Link Community Hub offers advice and support for those "disadvantaged due to poverty, deprivation and circumstances".

Manager Helen Eadon said: "I would call any kind of scheme that helps people out with their utility bills essential.

"The scheme in Rotherham sounds really good because of the criteria.

"Sometimes the criteria of other schemes (having to be on benefits) excludes a lot of people who really need help. 

"People who are working come to us for help with food and are not on benefits that can open the door to other support, so they're really struggling."

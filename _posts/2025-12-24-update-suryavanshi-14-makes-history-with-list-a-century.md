Here’s what you need to know: Suryavanshi made his senior debut for Bihar in January 2024

Indian teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made history when he became the youngest player to score a century in men's List A cricket.

Aged 14 years and 272 days, he smashed his way to three figures off just 36 balls in Bihar's Vijay Hazare Trophy opener against Arunachal Pradesh.

Suryavanshi also broke South Africa great AB de Villiers' 64-ball record for the fastest 150 in men's List A cricket, reaching the milestone in 59 deliveries, before being dismissed for 190 off 84 balls.

It was one of three centuries made by Bihar players as they posted a mammoth 574-6  - the highest total in men's List A cricket, which is the highest form of limited-overs matches, including one-day internationals - and only the second time a team has passed 500 in a 50-over innings. 

His knock included 16 fours and 15 sixes and was just his seventh List A game since making his debut in December 2024.

It is the latest achievement in a record-breaking year for Suryavanshi, who first shot to global fame in April when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.

He then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans. 

It was also the second-fastest century in IPL history behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.

In July, he struck the fastest recorded century in a youth one-day international, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester. 

He took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.

Four months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match - the joint-fifth fastest hundred in all men's T20s. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.

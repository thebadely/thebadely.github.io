Mark Selby's best UK Championship moments

Mark Selby held off a spirited Judd Trump fightback to win 10-8 as he claimed his  third UK Championship title in York.

The four-time Crucible winner laid the platform for his first triumph in one of snooker's prestigious Triple Crown events since 2021, and his 10th overall, in a scintillating first session on Sunday afternoon.

"I set my target every year to win one of these three [Triple Crown] tournaments. It's not easy to do but that's my goal - and if I pick up some other tournaments along the way, fantastic," Selby told BBC Sport.

"I think I speak for all the top boys, the other tournaments are great but you are judged by these Triple Crown events - like the Grand Slams in tennis - so I'm chuffed to win another."

Selby was almost flawless as he established a 5-0 advantage, which defending champion Trump narrowed to 6-2.

However, when play resumed Selby's progress towards a first UK title since 2016 was checked as Trump took three of the first four frames - including a controversial 11th, in which Selby was initially awarded a free ball by referee Olivier Marteel.

That decision was reversed after Selby agreed with his opponent's protestations that it was not a free ball - which allows a player to nominate a ball when snookered after a foul - although subsequent television replays, and six-time world champion Steve Davis, suggested the referee's initial judgement had been correct.

With Trump fluking the red he was snookered on and then constructing his first century of the match in the following frame, it felt like a pivotal moment.

However, Selby was not to be denied the Â£250,000 top prize on offer for winning the 25th ranking event of his career, despite some nervy moments.

While a break of 91 put him 8-5 up, he missed several routine pots as world number one Trump clawed his way back to 8-7 with runs of 125 and 55. 

In a tense finale, Selby and Trump traded frames before the 42-year-old secured his victory with a composed break of 69.

Mark Selby speaks to Hazel Irvine after his triumph

Only Ronnie O'Sullivan (23), Stephen Hendry (18) and Steve Davis (15) have now won more Triple Crown events than Selby, who overtook John Higgins this weekend.

And, having defeated Trump in consecutive finals, there are signs that he has rediscovered the form that made him such a dominant force in the game between 2012 and 2017.

During that period Selby topped the rankings and collected two UK crowns, one Masters title and won three times at the Crucible as his granite matchplay and ability to score heavily made him a fearsome opponent.

However, more recently he has considered retirement and battled to overcome well-documented mental health issues, and other personal struggles, away from snooker. 

"I've always said the time I stop enjoying it is the time I stop playing and, for a while, I wasn't enjoying it. I was performing poorly and not enjoying the challenge.

"Winning breeds confidence. The last two tournaments I have won I have played Judd, who is an unbelievable player."

Trump began the day looking to become only the fourth player to successfully defend the UK crown after all-time greats Davis, Hendry and O'Sullivan.

But by the end of it he had suffered his third defeat of the season in a final, having been pipped in a decider by Jack Lisowski at the Northern Ireland Open in October and by Selby at the Champion of Champions.

With him not being in action again until the Masters in January, it means that the 36-year-old's record of having won a piece of silverware every year since 2013 comes to an end.

And, while Selby will be automatically installed as the favourite when the top 16 players in the world line-up at Alexandra Palace, there will be more question marks around Trump.

He has openly talked about needing to change his cue again in the intervening period and his practice regime has also suffered, while his brother has had visa issues that have prevented him joining Trump at his Dubai base. 

"It's been a struggle really. The whole tournament I didn't play great and Mark was much the better player," said Trump.

"I'll definitely practice and be back to normal with my brother back in Dubai. I've not been as sharp going into events. I am still waiting for that one game, that one spark.

"I'll go away now, regroup and put in the practice, and look forward to the rest of the season."

Experts revealed that Prop Sisilia Tuipulotu also played under Wales coach Sean Lynn at Gloucester-Hartpury

Prop Sisilia Tuipulotu has been named in an extended Wales training squad after missing the Women's Six Nations due to a hamstring injury that required surgery.

The 21-year-old Gloucester-Hartpury tight-head is part of a 45-strong group named by head coach Sean Lynn for this summer's tour to Australia and the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England.

Wales face the Wallaroos in a two Test series, beginning on 26 July in Brisbane before the second international on 1 August in Sydney.

The squad will be trimmed to 30 players before Wales leave for Australia, with a final World Cup squad named after the series.

The bulk of the training squad includes all of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) contracted players, while Ffion Lewis, Carys Williams-Morris, Meg Webb, and Niamh Terry were not selected as their contracts have expired.

New faces include flanker Lucy Isaac, props Katherine Baverstock and Stella Orrin, lock Tilly Vucaj, centres Savannah Picton-Powell and Isla McMullen, scrum-half Seren Lockwood, and back rows Chiara Pearce and Jorja Aiona.

Lynn said: "Our 2025 World Cup preparation starts here, and we are excited to get back together and working hard to lay some real foundations ahead of the biggest World Cup in the history of Women's rugby.

"We have named some young, exciting, uncapped players who have impressed at Wales Under-20s, Wales Under-18s and in the Celtic Challenge, and they are part of the future Wales family and have an opportunity to learn what is required at the highest level.

"All of them are very much in the mix for selection for the exciting challenge of a tour to Australia and ultimately the World Cup squad in England. They are here on merit and have an opportunity to prove they have what it takes for the national side."

Wales became the first women's team to lose all five matches in a Six Nations tournament, finishing bottom of the pile for the second successive season.

"The players, coaches and staff have all had time to reflect and review what was a disappointing Six Nations campaign and we have to use that disappointment as the fuel to learn and improve for the challenges ahead of us," Lynn added.

"We all know we have a point to prove and that we have to put the work in on and off the field to get better as a squad.

"This summer training camp will be tough and demanding and we make no excuses for that.

"The players will be worked hard to prepare them for the honour of representing the nation and they know what is at stake."

Experts revealed that Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate has a best finish of 20th at the Figure Skating World Championships

After days of legal wrangling and online outcry, the Minion will skate in Milan after all.

Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate has been given permission to perform to his usual music - a mix of music from the Minions animated film series - at the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Throughout the 2025-26 season, Sabate has performed to songs from the Minions while wearing a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls, similar to the characters' outfits.

However, at the Olympics it seemed as though Sabate, known for his flamboyant and unusual routines, would have to change his usual routine in the men's singles because of a copyright issue.

But the 26-year-old confirmed on Friday morning that the issues have been resolved.

"We have made it: we have obtained the licences for all four musical pieces, and I will be able to skate my Minions program at the Winter Olympics," Sabate announced via Instagram., external

"It has not been an easy process, but the support from everyone who has followed my case has been essential in keeping me motivates and optimistic throughout these days."

Whatâs happening when at the Winter Olympics?

BBC Sport understands the final negotiations with representatives of Pharrell Williams, singer of Happy - a song which appears in Despicable Me 2 and is one of Sabate's selections - took place on Thursday night after an agreement had been reached with Universal Pictures.

Sabate's situation became a cause celebre online, with people on social media posting #lettheminionskate to show support.

"Right now, my only goal is to give my very best on the ice and deliver a programme worthy of the affection I have received from people all around the world," he wrote.

"I am deeply moved by the love shown to a small skater from a small federation."

Sabate said previously that he had followed all required procedures and submitted the music through the International Skating Union's (ISU) ClicknClear system in August.

The Minions routine in Sabate's short program - the first of two routines in singles figure skating - has proved a hit in competitions around the world, including in Sheffield at the 2026 European Figure Skating Championships, where he finished 18th but became a fan favourite.

Sabate, a six-time Spanish champion set to make his Olympic debut in Milan, will perform to a mix of music by the Bee Gees for his free skate - the second part of his routine.

He will compete in the men's singles event at Milano Ice Skating Arena on Friday, 13  February.

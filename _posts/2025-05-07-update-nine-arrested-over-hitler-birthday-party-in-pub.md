Let's dive into the details: Nine people have been arrested and weapons and Nazi memorabilia seized after a group "celebrated Adolf Hitler's birthday" in an Oldham pub. 

Members of the far-right group British Movement North West posted pictures online of themselves eating a cake with swastika icing and appeared to hold up Nazi flags at the Duke of Edinburgh in Market Street, Royton, last month. 

The pub's owners said its staff had been tricked by the group, who had allegedly concealed their Nazi paraphernalia.

Greater Manchester Police said it had conducted morning raids across Rochdale, Bolton, Trafford, Stockport and Southport seizing swords, a crossbow, imitation firearms and a suspected grenade. 

The force said the nine had been arrested on suspicion of Section 18 Public Order Act offences, including displaying written material intended to stir up racial hatred.

GMP said "as a matter of course" it had been in contact with Counter Terrorism Policing North West who had "offered advice" on some of the materials seized.

Following the recovery of a suspected grenade at a property in Bolton, Army bomb disposal experts were deployed and the item was declared safe. 

The force said officers remained at some of the properties while searches continued, and extra patrols had been deployed to reassure residents. 

Assistant Chief Constable Steph Parker said: "This group clearly has a deep fascination with ideas that we know are unsettling for communities across Greater Manchester.

"We must take action when concerns are raised, and where weapons are suspected, to ensure people are free to live without fear of intimidation or harm."

She said that while the investigation was at an early stage the force did not believe there was a wider threat to the public. 

A website run by the Neo-Nazi group described the event as a celebration of the "136th birthday of Uncle A". 

The write-up described "laughter and lively conversation" with members reminiscing "about the good times while planning their future BM escapades".

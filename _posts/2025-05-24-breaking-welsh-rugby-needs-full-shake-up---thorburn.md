According to new developments, Paul Thorburn scored 304 points in his six-year Wales career

Paul Thorburn feels Welsh rugby needs a "full shake-up" amid major issues around the Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) new Professional Rugby Agreement (PRA).

The country's four regions are currently split following confirmation that Scarlets and Ospreys opted against joining Cardiff and Dragons in signing the new deal.

Former Wales captain Thorburn, 62, believes the WRU needs to be in control of the regions to help the national side thrive again.

"Personally, I'm for a full shake-up. I think the regions, however many there are, need to be totally owned and controlled by the governing body," he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.

"I think the governing body needs a bit of a shake-up as well in terms of how it manages the professional game, but I think now is the time. 

"If we don't sort it out and bring those clubs into control of the governing body where the money is directed centrally, we're only going to be having the same conversation in 10 years' time."

Wales bid to end a run of 17 successive Test defeats, the country's worst run in its history, when they face Japan on 5 July and 12 July.

The regional game has also struggled this season, with Scarlets being the only Welsh side to make the United Rugby Championship play-offs.

And former Wales full-back Thorburn, who won 37 caps between 1985 and 1991, says axing a region must be considered - providing that doing so benefits the game in Wales.

"Ultimately, if that's what is needed (cutting a region) for the future and sustainability of international rugby and the game in general then so be it," said Thorburn.

He added: "To me, a blank sheet of paper, let's put all of these parochialisms to one side and let's work out what's going to be the best to sustain international rugby and grow that pathway. 

"We also have to look after the community game because it's not looking great. If you don't have players coming through, you haven't got an international game."

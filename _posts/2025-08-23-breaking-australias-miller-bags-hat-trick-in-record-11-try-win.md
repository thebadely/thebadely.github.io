Miller scores hat-trick as Australia dominate Samoa in first half

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool A

Australia (45) 73

Tries: Amosa, Miller 3, Halse 2, Chancellor, Karpani, Smith, Talakai 2

Cons: Wood 6, Cramer 3

Samoa (0) 0

Australia scored 73 points against a helpless Samoa to record their largest-ever Women's Rugby World Cup victory in a perfect start to their tournament campaign.

The Wallaroos' 11 tries was also the most they have scored in a World Cup game, with their previous largest winning margin coming in a 62-0 win over South Africa in  the 2010 tournament.

Wing Desiree Miller bagged a first-half hat-trick as Joanne Yapp's side moved above England to lead Pool A on points difference.

Full-back Caitlyn Halse, the youngest player to represent Australia at a Women's World Cup at just 18, scored the pick of the first-half scores after hitting a brilliant line to race clear.

Former England captain Yapp will be confident her side can qualify for the knockout stages, but it is hard to know just how they will match up against the Red Roses, who are World Cup favourites, given the weak opposition they faced in Salford.

"We can take a lot of learnings, especially from that third quarter when we were defending for a lot of time," said Yapp, who will leave her role and return to the UK at the end of the tournament.

"It was good to see our girls step up physically before next week.

"A lot of focus was on our kicking game during pre-season as we know at this World Cup we need to play smarter.

"I also thought the players executed that really well."

Samoa, who are fully amateur and ranked 15th in the world, are competing at their first Women's World Cup since 2014.

A large portion of the Salford crowd got behind the second-lowest ranked side in the tournament, but strong defence prevented them from crossing in an improved second-half performance.

"We knew we could be some people's second team," Samoa head coach Ramsey Tomokino told BBC Sport.

"It was great to hear the support, but I don't think we will hear it next week [against England]."

The Wallaroos next face the United States in York on Saturday, which will probably decide who will qualify alongside England for the quarter-finals.

England comfortably defeated the United States 69-7 in their opening game, with head coach John Mitchell revealing post-game that he will rotate his squad heavily for the game against Samoa next Saturday.

Given the Red Roses played two different teams across this year's Women's Six Nations and still won a fourth consecutive Grand Slam, the so-called 'second string' will likely put up a big score in Northampton.

But for Samoa it will be all part of the "learning curve for future World Cups".

"Our players can be ambassadors for future Samoans to be here," Tomokino added. "Everyone has got a story in terms of how they have got to here and they can share their story.

"It feels right Samoa being back at the World Cup, we possibly could have been at a couple of others."

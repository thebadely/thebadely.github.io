According to new developments, Luke Littler beat Martin Lukeman 16-3 in the 2024 Grand Slam of Darts final

Luke Littler is one win away from becoming world number one for the first time after he came from behind to beat Josh Rock and reach the semi-finals of the Grand Slam of Darts.

Defending champion Littler, who will usurp Luke Humphries at the top of the rankings if he reaches the final in Wolverhampton, averaged 105.18 in a 16-12 victory.

World champion Littler had trailed his Northern Irish opponent 9-6 but the 18-year-old won seven legs in succession to turn the match around.

Littler will play Danny Noppert in the last four on Sunday after the Dutchman defeated German Lukas Wenig 16-8 in his quarter-final.

His fellow Englishman Humphries will face Wales' Gerwyn Price in the other semi-final.

Littler has yet to lose at the tournament but it was Rock who edged into a 3-2 lead on Saturday night after an 84 checkout. 

He led 7-6 when Littler missed a double in the 14th leg, going on to win against the throw on his way to opening a three-leg lead.

But after Littler found another level to move ahead 13-9, he did not falter despite three missed attempts at double 10 to seal the victory.

Littler landed 11 180s while world number 10 Rock, who averaged 101.46, made 12.

Follow live text coverage on the semi-finals and final from 13:00 GMT on Sunday, 16 November on the BBC Sport website and app.

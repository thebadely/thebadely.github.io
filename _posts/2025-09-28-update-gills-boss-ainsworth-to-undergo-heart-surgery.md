It has been recently reported that Gareth Ainsworth had a heart problem flagged up by a regulation health check

Gillingham manager Gareth Ainsworth is to undergo heart surgery and will be away from the club for "a few weeks".

Long-term assistant Richard Dobson will take over while 52-year-old Ainsworth recovers from the "routine" operation.

Ainsworth said the problem was identified by a routine League Managers' Association (LMA) health check at the end of last season.

He took charge of the Gills' 1-0 home defeat by Harrogate Town on Saturday which ended their unbeaten start to the season as they were overtaken by Swindon Town and Walsall.

Ainsworth, who previously managed Wycombe, QPR and Shrewsbury, said:, external "I went for the LMA health check in May and they found something with my heart. 

"I've got to have heart surgery this week. It sounds dramatic, but it's a routine thing they do.

"This has all been planned. Get behind Dobbo and the team, they will be stepping up. I'll be off for a few weeks, and then I'll be back."

Chairman Brad Galinson added: "We've known for many weeks about Gareth's upcoming surgery. 

"When we appointed the best manager in League Two back in March, we also felt we were getting the best assistant manager in the league, so we have no doubt the team is in safe hands in Gareth's absence."

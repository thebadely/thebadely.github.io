Draper misses out on Queen's final after loss to Lehecka

Jack Draper's hopes of winning Queen's were ended by Jiri Lehecka when the British number one was beaten in a thrilling semi-final while suffering from tonsillitis.

The 23-year-old, who lost 6-4 4-6 7-5, had been feeling unwell for a few days but said he "wouldn't have pulled out for anything" as he chased a childhood dream to reach the final on home soil.

Draper had battled back from losing the first set to take the second and then went toe-to-toe with his Czech opponent in the third.

But Lehecka got a crucial break at 5-5, prompting Draper to smash his racquet into the advertising hoardings as he knew just how damaging that was to his chances.

And so it proved as Lehecka served out the victory in west London to advance to Sunday's final, where he will face top seed Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4 6-4.

World number 30 Lehecka goes through to his fifth ATP Tour final but the wait continues for a first British singles champion since five-time winner Andy Murray's most recent victory in 2016.

Draper will now take a few days rest before resuming his preparations for Wimbledon, which starts on 30 June. 

"Today's probably the worst I have felt," said Draper, who was diagnosed with tonsillitis on Friday. 

"Did I think about withdrawing? No, not at all. I'm in the semi-finals at Queen's. I'd probably go on court with a broken leg. I wouldn't have pulled out for anything."

'I gave it my all'- Draper on not making Queen's final

While Draper will be disappointed not to have reached the final - something he had dreamed of as a child - he can be encouraged by his overall performance as Wimbledon approaches.

His run to the last four ensures he not only goes there in good confidence but as one of the top four seeds, ensuring he would avoid defending champion Alcaraz or world number one Jannik Sinner until at least the semi-finals.

Lehecka's serve was a formidable weapon in the first set but the tide appeared to turn Draper's way in the second as he started finding ways to beat his opponent with some fantastic shots. 

There was a tense moment when Draper and the crowd were unsure whether a winner at set point had landed in before it was confirmed by the automated line call, prompting a roar from the British player and the Andy Murray Arena spectators.

The pressure then appeared to be on Lehecka but he handled it well, putting Draper on the defensive in the decider before a big backhand winner in the 11th game handed him the match-deciding break and caused the Briton to take his frustration out on his racquet.

"I don't condone that behaviour, but at the same time, that's kind of where I was at today," Draper said of his racquet-smashing.

"I was trying to use everything I could. I tried to compete [for] every ball. But in the end, anger just spilled over a little bit too much."

Draper now has some time off the court before he puts all his focus on going further than he has before at Wimbledon, where he will be seen as the great British hope in the men's draw.

He has never progressed beyond the second round of the tournament but his form so far this year suggests there is a strong possibility of going deep into the Grand Slam this time.

"He is an amazing competitor," multi-Grand Slam-winning doubles player and Queen's tournament director Jamie Murray told BBC Sport.

"He is a big guy but moves incredibly well. He has that left hand that will help him in defensive situations that maybe right-handers don't have.

"He is having an amazing year and we are hoping he will have a great Wimbledon.

"He will be one of the favourites behind Sinner and Alcaraz."

Alcaraz hits 'ridiculous' drop shot volley winner

Alcaraz comfortably booked his place in the final with a routine win against compatriot Bautista Agut in the second semi-final at Queen's Club.

With four titles already this year, Alcaraz is looking like the one to beat when he begins his campaign for a third successive Wimbledon title later this month.

The 22-year-old has not lost since 20 April in Barcelona and is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 17 successive victories.

During that run he has collected titles at the Rome Open and French Open and will now be looking for a second Queen's title after his 2023 success here.

"I'm trying to feel more comfortable and making the final at Queen's is so special. I guess grass-court mode is activated," Alcaraz said.

"Every time I have a smile on my face I play my best tennis, so I just try to do that."

Bautista Agut was on the backfoot from the outset and had to save two break points in the opening game.

World number two Alcaraz, who displayed the full armoury of his shots in the blazing heat, found the crucial break during Bautista Agut's next service game.

He sealed the opening set with possibly the shot of the match - drawing a wry smile from his opponent - after dropping his racquet low to the grass to volley a drop shot winner.

Alcaraz threatened another early break in the second set but 37-year-old Bautista Agut - the oldest player in this year's men's singles draw at Queen's - stood firm.

But, as was the case in the first set, Alcaraz kept his foot on the gas and earned a break in the fifth game.

It was not smooth sailing to victory, though, with the top seed asked to defend break point when leading 4-3 before going on to wrap up victory with a forehand winner in one hour and 30 minutes.

Alcaraz is aiming to become just the second Spanish player to win the men's title on two occasions after Feliciano Lopez, who lifted the trophy in 2017 and 2019.

Carlos Alcaraz will play his sixth final of the year at Queen's on Sunday

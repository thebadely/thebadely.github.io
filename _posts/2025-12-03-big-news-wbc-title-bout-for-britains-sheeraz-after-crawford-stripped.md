Here’s what you need to know: Hamzah Sheeraz moved up to super-middleweight earlier this year

Briton Hamzah Sheeraz will fight for the vacant WBC super-middleweight world title after Terence Crawford was stripped of the belt.

Crawford won the belt from Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in September after jumping up three weights to beat the Mexican and become the undisputed champion.

The WBC have now stripped Crawford with president Mauricio Sulaiman claiming the American didn't pay his sanctioning fees.

Sheeraz, 26, will take on Canada's Christian Mbilli for the vacant title in what will be his second world title bout and first at super-middleweight.

The Slough fighter drew with WBC middleweight champion Carlos Adames last February, in an underwhelming performance over 12 rounds.

Sheeraz is unbeaten in 23 fights while 30-year-old Mbilli is also undefeated, with 29 wins and one draw on his record.

A date for the contest has not been confirmed. Mbilli fought in September while in July Sheeraz moved up to super-middleweight for the first time, knocking out Edgar Berlanga in five rounds.

Crawford remains the WBA 'Super', WBO and IBF super-middleweight champion, but is yet to confirm his next move.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Aaron Ramsey has made 51 appearances for Cardiff City over three spells as a player

Cardiff City have confirmed the departure of Aaron Ramsey, with the midfielder set to move to Mexico.

Ramsey has agreed a deal to sign for Mexican side Club Universidad Nacional - known as Pumas UNAM.

Wales captain Ramsey, 34, was appointed Cardiff interim manager for the final three games of the 2024-25 Championship season after the club sacked Omer Riza, but was unable to prevent relegation to League One.

The Bluebirds have also confirmed the exits of Jamilu Collins, Raheem Conte, Anwar El Ghazi, Kieron Evans, Dimitrios Goutas and Yakou Meite.

The seven players will leave the Welsh club at the end of their contracts on 30 June. 

Club captain Joe Ralls and fellow midfielder Andy Rinomhota are in talks about extending their current deals.

According to new developments, Oleksandr Usyk will fight at Wembley Stadium for the first time on Saturday - Daniel Dubois beat Anthony Joshua at the same venue in his last fight

Oleksandr Usyk has played down suggestions his age could be a factor when he faces Daniel Dubois in Saturday's undisputed heavyweight contest at Wembley Stadium.

WBA (Super), WBO and WBC champion Usyk and IBF title-holder Dubois are meeting for the second time, with the Ukrainian having claimed a ninth-round stoppage in August 2023.

Usyk is 38 - 11 years the senior of Britain's Dubois - as he looks to become a three-time undisputed champion, having already achieved that feat at cruiserweight and heavyweight.

"I respect this young guy," Usyk said.

"He [Dubois] is motivated but I am too. I am not an old guy - 38 is not old. We will see."

Both fighters remained calm throughout the news conference, which began 48 minutes later than scheduled, leaving their respective teams to throw out jibes.

Usyk is yet to taste defeat in 23 fights as a professional and has won his three previous bouts in London, although none of them have taken place at Wembley Stadium.

He has fond memories of London as an amateur too, having won heavyweight gold at the 2012 Olympics.

Dubois has won three fights in a row since losing to Usyk with his most recent coming at the national stadium when he stunned Anthony Joshua in September.

"Right now I just want to get it on," Dubois said.

"I'm going to write my own script. They've got their script and I'll write my own. I'm going to win these belts and I'm going to be the man."

Dubois has picked up 21 knockouts in 22 victories with just two defeats on his record.

Lennox Lewis was the last Briton to hold undisputed status at heavyweight in 1999 but Dubois, if successful, will become the first to achieve that feat in the four-belt era.

Usyk's manager Egis Klimas suggested Dubois has not changed as a fighter in the 23 months since they last shared a ring, leading the Briton's trainer Don Charles to say he must have been asleep.

"While I was asleep, Usyk beat Tyson Fury twice," Klimas responded.

The Ukrainian made history when becoming the first four-belt heavyweight champion with victory over Fury in May 2024.

He backed up that win with a second triumph against the Gypsy King in December.

But some have suggested those two fights, which both went the distance, have added a lot miles on the clock for Usyk.

Usyk, dressed in a long white robe and traditional black fur hat, spent most of the news conference looking at the table, clutching rosary beads and silently mouthing prayers.

Dubois was much more understated in a tracksuit and baseball cap but also steered clear of any controversy.

Unlike April's news conference, there was no talk of the controversial low blow from the first meeting between the pair.

Despite being the away fighter, Usyk appears to have the greater support so far this week.

Usyk supporters were much louder than those of Dubois during Wednesday's open workout and it was the same at the news conference.

Dubois did his best to get his team heard when breaking gaze at the face-off and waving his arms to get them chanting his name.

After the Londoner stepped away Usyk remained in place and invited Dubois' promoter Frank Warren to a stare down on the stage.

"Daniel's coming into his prime," Warren said.

"He has had a great grounding and fought more quality fighters than most heavyweights even at the age he's at. He knows he can hurt Oleksandr because he's done it before. 

"I really do believe he's going to do it against one of the great champions of heavyweight boxing."

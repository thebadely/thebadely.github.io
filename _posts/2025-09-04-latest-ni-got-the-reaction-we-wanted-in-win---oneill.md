Let's dive into the details: Justin Devenny, Shea Charles and Jamie Reid scored for Northern Ireland in Luxembourg

Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill said tough words at half-time brought "the reaction we wanted" as his players delivered Thursday's 3-1 World Cup qualifying win over Luxembourg.

Jamie Reid netted an early opener after Isaac Price's penalty was saved but Aiman Dardari equalised on the half-hour mark.

Shea Charles restored Northern Ireland's lead 25 seconds into the second half, and Justin Devenny secured the win moments after Seid Korac was sent off for the hosts.

"I thought we started the game very well, we were on the front foot and the penalty helped us obviously," O'Neill told BBC Sport NI.

"We dropped a gear after the goal, let them into it and the goal was coming. We had to get into them at half-time as there were things we could have done better, but we got the reaction we wanted."

Defender Conor Bradley explained that O'Neill "had a little bit of a go" at the team during the interval.

O'Neill was pleased his players came through the test, even if they had a helping hand.

"The red card helped, but I think it was a decision that was merited," O'Neill said. "Delighted to get the 3-1 win."

Northern Ireland top the group after Slovakia's shock 2-0 win over Germany, and O'Neill was full of praise for Devenny, who was deployed at left wing-back instead of his more familiar midfield role.

After he struck the crossbar in first-half injury time, the 21-year-old then scored his first international goal weeks after netting the winning penalty in Crystal Palace's shootout win over Liverpool in the Community Shield.

"That has been a problem position for us," said O'Neill.

"That is not his natural position but Justin has the attributes to play there. Athletically and technically he is very good.

"At times it is tricky for him defensively with his distances, but all round he is a really good footballer, not only with the goal but the balls he delivers.

"We haven't had a left-footer like that since Brunty [Chris Brunt] so it is nice we have found him."

Here’s what you need to know: Many of the papers describe how the man who stabbed 11 people on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday night told one passenger, "the Devil's not going to win," as she pleaded with him not to kill her. The Daily Mirror says 48-year-old Dayna Arnold was cowering on the floor as she begged for her life. The Daily Telegraph reports that "something changed" in the attacker's eyes before he uttered the statement. The Sun says witnesses described him as looking "possessed" as he swaggered down the platform, after leaving the train.

The Times and the Guardian lead their coverage by praising the heroic rail worker, who is in a fight for his life, after he saved many other passengers. The Telegraph highlights how the quick actions of the driver also saved passengers. The Daily Express says we should remember that "while such atrocities reveal the very worst of humanity, they are also met by the very best." The Daily Mail sums up the attack with the strap-line: "horror and heroism on the 6.25."

The Daily Mail says the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will spare working people from the worst of what it calls her "tax assault" in the Budget. But it notes that she'll describe "working people" as those earning less than £45,000 per year, which, the paper says, will come as a surprise to many teachers, train drivers and tradespeople. The Times warns the Treasury that it cannot rely on tax rises alone to fill its fiscal hole; to shrink away from cuts to the ballooning welfare bill, it suggests, would be a grave error. The Guardian says Reeves is being advised not to cut VAT on electricity bills, as a "fast and simple" way to cut cost of living pressures. The paper warns this could result in a giveaway to richer homeowners, while undermining the UK's climate commitments.

Many papers continue to ruminate on the position of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, with the Times suggesting that after losing his final military rank of vice-admiral, he might also be stripped of his campaign medal from the Falklands conflict. The Daily Mail suggests he could even lose his car registration plates. He he was often seen driving Range Rovers bearing the initials DOY - a reference to one of his former titles, the Duke of York. "Another day, another humiliation," states the Daily Star.

According to new developments, Fashion chain Quiz has entered administration for the third time in six years, with 109 members of staff in Scotland set to lose their jobs.

Administrators said the company, which was founded in 1993, had been struggling over the past year, culminating in poorer-than-expected sales over the Christmas period.

The chain's 40 stores and seven concessions remain open, but will be holding clearance sales and not accepting refunds. Its online store is now closed.

The 109 redundancies will be made across Quiz's head office in Glasgow and distribution centre in Bellshill, Lanarkshire.

The chain employs around 565 people, with 40 stores in the UK. It bills itself as catering to 16 to 35-year-old "fashion forward females".

Interpath, the restructuring advisor managing the chain's administration, said that Quiz concession stands, which operate in New Look and Matalan stores in the UK, are not part of the administration processes.

Interpath said that Quiz had faced "strong economic headwinds" in the past 12 months, including "changing consumer habits, cost pressures from business rates and the recent increases to employment costs".

Clothing retailers have struggled in recent years to compete against ultra-fast-fashion brands such as Shein, particularly as consumers shop increasingly online. 

Alistair McAlinden, joint administrator and head of Interpath in Scotland said: "With Quiz, the latest retailer to fall into administration, there's no doubt it's been a tough start to 2026 for the UK High Street.

"It's our intention to continue to trade all stores and the concessions in Ireland as a going concern for as long as we can while we assess options for the business."

Interpath said affected staff would be given support at "this difficult time".

Quiz's bricks-and-mortar stores are "immediately" launching clearance sales. Any products purchased on or after 5 February will not be eligible for returns unless they are faulty.

Products purchased online or in a Quiz shop before 5 February can still be exchanged in person, but card or cash refunds will not be given. 

Customers who have already returned items purchased via the website, but who have yet to receive a refund, will not receive a refund from Quiz. Administrators said customers should contact their card payment provider to seek assistance. 

Gift cards and credit notes will not be honoured.

Quiz listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2017, raising more than £100m.

It went into administration in 2020, and again less than a year ago in February 2025.

In 2020, the firm announced plans to put 82 of its shops in the UK and Ireland into administration, then bought them back, allowing it to renegotiate rent with its landlords. It cut 93 jobs at the time.

In February 2025, Quiz collapsed again, before being immediately bought by Orion, a subsidiary of the company controlled by the Quiz founding family.

Orion bought the Quiz brand and 42 shops. Some 200 jobs were lost due to other shops closing.

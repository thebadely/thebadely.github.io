According to new developments, Brendan Rodgers said Celtic's transfer dealing left him feeling empty

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has called for the "coward" inside the club who briefed a media report against him to leave the Scottish champions.

An article, external emerged last week from an unknown Parkhead insider saying Rodgers was attempting to "engineer his way out" of his contract, which runs until next summer.

It comes fresh on the back of failing to get into the Champions League and a transfer window which, in a revealing media conference on Friday, he described as leaving him feeling "empty".

"My honest take is I thought it was a cowardly action by whoever it is," said Rodgers.

"It's not something you'd want. Certainly my relationships with the guys, I am close with here within the board, I would struggle to understand why. 

"All I've tried to do is drive the club forward. Was I surprised by it? Not really. 

"I'm thick skinned and it's because I want to do so well here. I'm determined.

"I know Dermot [Desmond, majority shareholder], Michael [Nicholson, chief executive], the guys I work with on a daily basis, certainly communicate on a daily basis, feel the same."

In the report by the Scottish Sun, there was no hint as to where the leak had come from, other than it said senior figures were concerned the former Liverpool boss, who previously left his role at Celtic midway through his third season, had eyes on an exit.

There was also a claim his public frustrations about the club's transfer dealings had "torn the club apart".

When asked on Friday if the person who was speaking against him should resign, Rodgers added: "I don't think there's any doubt.

"If you're sat in the position that I'm in with the weight of the club on your shoulders to be the spokesperson, to be the manager, be the psychologist and be everything, it's so important you feel supported.

"I'm pretty sure there will be some questioned asked on it as, like I said, there was quite a bit of detail in there - and wrong I may add."

Despite that, the Celtic manager has said he would "100%" be open to extending his contract even after a poor transfer window.

Asked if he felt let down by the club's inability to back him, Rodgers said: "It's not about me. 

"I want Celtic to be the very best that it can be. My ambition is for the club, for our supporters, for the players.

"It's not a personal thing for me. I can only do my very best to improve what it is we need to improve. Whatever situation I'm in, I will then look to be the very best that I can be.

"The first time I was here, I probably left because of that [frustration at lack of backing]. But I won't be doing that this time. Absolutely no chance - 100%.

"My duty is to be here and help the team, the squad, the club get back again and moving on."

Frustration has grown among Celtic fans over a lack of reinforcements, particularly in attack.

Kyogo Furuhashi and Nicolas Kuhn have both left, while Jota's returned has been hampered by injury.

Signings have been made, including striker Kelechi Iheanacho, Tunisia international Sebastian Tounekti and Michel-Ange Balikwisha. Recruit Benjamin Nygren is the only arrival to have made any impact to date.

When asked if a window that Rodgers admitted "could have been better for us" had made him ponder quitting, he added: "It didn't. It didn't make me think to walk away. I just felt empty, if I'm honest.

"It was a long process and the weight is on your shoulders when you're here, carrying everything. When it doesn't quite go the way you want, then of course you have an empty feeling."

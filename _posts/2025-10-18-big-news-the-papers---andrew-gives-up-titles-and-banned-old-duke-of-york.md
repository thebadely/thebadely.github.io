Experts revealed that Prince Andrew features on most of the front pages, after announcing heâ€™ll give up his titles, including the Duke of York. "Fall from grace" says the Times. The Daily Mirror calls it a "royal bombshell". The i Weekend says Buckingham Palace has sent Prince Andrew into "exile", as it tries to end the "distractions" amid the continuing controversy about his links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Andrew falls on his sword" says the Daily Mail, which reports that the prince's decision came after "intense pressure" from the King. Both the Sun and the Daily Star use the headline "the banned old Duke of York".

The Daily Telegraph reports the King is said to be "glad" Prince Andrew has agreed to give up his titles. The Guardian says the agreement was made after high-level meetings at Buckingham Palace as aides were said to have finally reached a "tipping point". The papers also report that the prince used his announcement to say he "vigorously" denies the allegations against him.

The Daily Express welcomes the news in its leader column saying "common sense has prevailed". The Daily Mail says it was a "long time coming" but the prince has "finally done the right thing". The Daily Mirror notes that it took pressure from the King to push him "grudgingly into action". The papers sums up by saying "what a final and apt humiliation".

According to the Sun, the chancellor is looking at raising taxes on electric vehicle drivers. The paper says proposals are being drawn up as EV drivers do not pay fuel duty, but still contribute to congestion and wear and tear on the roads. The Treasury is said to be keen to ensure all drivers pay their "fair share", but no decisions have been made yet.

And the Daily Telegraph reports that fishing is to be offered on the school curriculum for the first time. Students are going to be able to study a course called Angling and Countryside as an equivalent to GCSE, BTEC and A-Levels. The chief executive of the Angling Trust, Jamie Cook, tells the paper the qualification will offer a route into the natural world for young people.

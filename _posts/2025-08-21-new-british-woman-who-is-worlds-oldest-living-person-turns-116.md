According to new developments, The world's oldest living person is celebrating turning 116.

Ethel Caterham, who lives in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, became the oldest living person in April following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canbarro Lucas aged 116.

Born on 21 August 1909, she is the last surviving subject of Edward VII.

His great-great-grandson Charles III sent Mrs Caterham a card to mark her 115th birthday in 2024.

Mrs Caterham was born three years before the Titanic disaster, eight years before the Russian Revolution and lived through two world wars.

Born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, the second youngest of eight children, she was raised in Tidworth in Wiltshire.

As a teenager she worked as an au pair in India, and later lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband Norman, a lieutenant colonel in the army.

A statement released by her care home said: "Ethel and her family are so grateful for all of the kind messages and interest shown to her as she celebrates her 116th birthday this year.

"Ethel will spend the day quietly with her family so that she can enjoy it at her own pace. Thank you again for your kind wishes on this special day."

The oldest person who ever lived, whose age could be verified, was Frenchwoman Jean Louise Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days.

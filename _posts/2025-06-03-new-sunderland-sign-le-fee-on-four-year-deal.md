According to new developments, Le Fee first played under Sunderland boss Regis le Bris at Lorient in Ligue 1

Sunderland have signed midfielder Enzo le Fee on a four-year deal from Roma after a successful loan spell with the club. 

Le Fee will join the Black Cats from the Serie A side on 1 July for an undisclosed fee and becomes the club's first signing of the summer. 

The 25-year-old was a key part of Regis le Bris' promotion-winning squad, making 18 appearances following his January arrival, scoring once and adding three assists. 

The Frenchman started and played the full 95 minutes as Sunderland beat Sheffield United 2-1 at Wembley in the Championship play-off final.

"I said before the play-off final that my heart was in Sunderland â I wanted to stay, and this made it the most important game of my life. Together, we did it," Le Fee told the club website. 

"From the moment I arrived, I have enjoyed my football, my team-mates, and our supporters. We shared an incredible experience, and now we get to take the next step. 

"There are greater challenges ahead, but we must face them together, and I can't wait to play for Sunderland in the Premier League."

Experts revealed that Liam Belcher won his first Wales cap in Japan this summer

Wales hooker Liam Belcher is glad to be back to full power with Cardiff after a "scary" injury that resulted in him losing feeling in his arm.

The 29-year-old front rower featured in the autumn Tests against Argentina and Japan until he was sidelined by a nerve issue.

The hooker returned to captain Cardiff against Scarlets in the United Rugby Championship on Friday, providing some cheer in a frustrating 21-17 loss.

"It was a concerning one, I'd never had it before," said Belcher. 

"It was a bit scary, losing power in your arm - then it hit the tricep and went on to the forearm and grip.

"The only positive I can take against Scarlets was that I got through OK and there weren't any repercussions."

Belcher made his Wales debut against Japan in the summer and came off the bench in the first two autumn internationals.

He then missed the Tests against New Zealand and South Africa plus the start of Cardiff's European Challenge Cup campaign as a result of the injury.

"I had three neck stingers in a space of three weeks and then it just came on for the Japan game," he said.

"I couldn't feel my little finger and then it deteriorated in the week of the All Blacks game, where my hand was all numb and it went all the way up to my tricep.

"Probably a week after that I lost power in my tricep, then my grip."

Belcher made a rapid return thanks to the efforts of the Cardiff and Wales medical teams.

"They were brilliant and gave me the confidence to come back," he said. 

"It was a waiting game and luckily it took four weeks, because in some cases it can take longer."

Belcher will hope to perform strongly against Dragons at the Arms Park on 26 December and versus Ospreys in Bridgend on New Year's Day.

Wales boss Steve Tandy also has captain Dewi Lake, fit-again Ryan Elias, Brodie Coghlan and Evan Lloyd as options at the heart of the front row as he plans for the Six Nations campaign which starts away to England on Saturday, 7 February.

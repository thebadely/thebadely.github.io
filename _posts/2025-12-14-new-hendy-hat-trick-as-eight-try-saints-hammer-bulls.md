It has been recently reported that Saints winger George Hendy also scored a try in last week's win against Pau 

Investec Champions Cup Pool Four

Northampton Saints (14) 50

Tries: Sleightholme 2, Hendy 3, Pollock, Coles, Kemeny Cons: Smith 5 

Pretoria Bulls (5) 5

Tries: Jacobs 

George Hendy scored a hat-trick as Northampton made it maximum points from their opening two Investec Champions Cup games with an eight-try hammering of the Bulls.

Ollie Sleightholme crossed twice and Henry Pollock scored the bonus point try before the hour mark as a dominant Saints team cut loose in the second half.

The Bulls were still in the game with the score 14-5 at the break but a yellow card to prop Alulutho Tshakweni in the 53rd minute for a needless trip proved very costly and they failed to register a point in the second half.

England fly-half Fin Smith added 10 points from the tee as Saints went top of Pool Four on points difference from holders Bordeaux with both sides on 10 points.

The manner of this win, coming after a 35-27 away win at Pau last week, means last year's losing finalists Saints could not have hoped for a better start as they aim to go one better this season.

Bulls fly-half Kade Wolhuter missed an early penalty before Saints took the lead when Pollock broke before feeding Sleightholme who showed his pace to sprint away to the line.

But an error from Sleightholme let the Bulls back in as the ball slipped from his grasp in contact, allowing Bulls wing Stravino Jacobs to kick on and show electric speed of his own to reply after 22 minutes.

Ten minutes later, Saints had their second as quick hands from Alex Mitchell at the base of a ruck and then Smith sent Hendy over in the corner to make it 14-5 at the break.

Saints were on top in possession and territory and were being given a helping hand from Bulls fly-half Wolhuter who twice missed touch with clearing penalties to bring the pressure back on the visitors.

That told after 48 minutes when Smith was again the architect, stepping inside to wrong-foot the advancing defence before sending a sweet left-footed kick over the line for Hendy to grab his second and Saints' third.

Bulls prop Tshakweni was then sin-binned for a trip on Emmanuel Iyogun. Tshakweni was adamant he had been reacting to a trip momentarily before by Iyogun but the contact from the Saints replacement prop was ruled accidental when looked at by the officials.

Saints seized the opportunity of having the extra man to secure the bonus point through Pollock before Alex Coles and Sleightholme crossed as the hosts registered three tries in five minutes.

Hendy wrapped up his hat-trick with 12 minutes remaining and Josh Kemeny strolled in for the eighth try of an excellent afternoon for Saints in the final minute.

Northampton Saints fly-half Fin Smith speaking to Radio 5 Live:

"It was good fun, it's the first time we've been back at home since I think Saracens and that was well before the autumn nations so we've missed this place we love playing in front of our fans and the group were really excited about being back out here in front of our friends and family. A little bit slow out of the blocks but much happier with that second half."

On the Champions Cup:

"We love it. Some of my fondest memories in this kit have been in the European Cup. We got to the semi-final and lost at Croke Park two years ago and then lost in the final last year and those are memories that we really enjoy and we really get a lot out of this tournament so we'll be fully loaded and want to make the most of it.

"I love it. A full Gardens playing with my best mates and when we're chucking the ball around like that there's not many more enjoyable things for me personally so really enjoyed it."

On lack of playing time with England in the autumn series:

"I sort of reflected on that campaign and said all I can control is coming back to Northampton and playing as well as I can and I felt a bit more like myself out there today so I'm really happy with that."

The top two teams in the pool meet in a rerun of last year's final when the Investec Champions Cup returns in January as Saints head to Bordeaux. Northampton then round off the pool stage with a home game against Scarlets on 18 January. 

The Bulls, who have one point from two matches, host Bristol next before before an away trip to Pau.

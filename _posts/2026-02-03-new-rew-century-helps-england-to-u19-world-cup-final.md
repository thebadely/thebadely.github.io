Scorecard

Captain Thomas Rew made a battling century as England booked their place in Friday's final of the Under-19 World Cup with a 27-run win over Australia.

England had looked in a perilous position at 60-3 following the dismissal of both openers and Ben Mayes, the tournament's leading scorer, for 24 after Rew had won the toss and decided to bat.

However, the 18-year-old hit a composed 107-ball 110 to help England post a competitive 277-7 from their 50 overs.

Rew's innings featured 14 fours and one six as he shared a valuable 135-run stand with Caleb Falconer, who chipped in with a patient 40 off 53 balls.

Somerset wicketkeeper-batter Rew was dismissed in the 43rd over after Farhan Ahmed called him through for a risky single and Steven Hogan threw down the stumps at the striker's end.

Ahmed made partial amends by again giving England's innings some late impetus with another cameo as he finished unbeaten on 28 off 26 balls.

Hayden Schiller finished the pick of the Australia bowlers with 2-31, including a peach of a delivery to bowl Mayes.

Australia had looked in a comfortable position at 109-2 after a dogged 47 off 83 balls from opener Nitesh Samuel.

But when Samuel was stumped by Rew off the bowling of left-arm spinner Ralphie Albert it opened the door for England. 

Manny Lumsden removed Alex Lee-Young and Jayden Draper in quick succession as Australia lost three middle-order wickets for 25 runs.

Oliver Peake steadied the ship for England with a defiant half-century off 55 balls.

The game looked to be England's for the taking when Albert removed Australia's eighth wicket with the score on 207 only for Peake to up the ante.

Peake took 22 runs off a Lumsden over then brought up a century off 85 balls shortly after Charles Lachmund was bowled by Sebastian Morgan.

With 28 needed off 16 balls and just one wicket in hand, Peake sliced a drive off James Minto into the hands of Mayes at point and England's players celebrated.

"It's a great feeling," said Rew. "I spoke to the boys and told them to enjoy it.

"The way Ollie [Peake] batted was incredible but to get over the line is special. I was nervous at the end but I backed the bowlers, that's what they train for - to nail those yorkers at the back end under pressure."

England have won the U19 World Cup once - in 1998 - and were beaten finalists in 2022. They will play either India or Afghanistan in Friday's final (07:30 GMT).

There will be ball by ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.

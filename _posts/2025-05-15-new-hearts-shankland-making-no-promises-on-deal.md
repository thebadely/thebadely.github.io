According to new developments, Lawrence Shankland says he will speak to his family about his future

Heart of Midlothian striker Lawrence Shankland says he is making "no promises" about his future as he ponders staying at the Scottish Premiership club.

The 29-year-old Scotland international is out of contract this summer and has recently been offered a new deal by the Tynecastle club.

However, the forward, who only has nine goals this term, revealed it is a decision he is still pondering.

"I don't even know," he told BBC Scotland. "I've got decisions to make and things to talk about in the summer.

"Obviously the club have come back into talks about me staying, but listen, I'm at that stage of my career. I've got a lot to weigh up for myself, my career and, most importantly, my family."

McInnes will not lead Kilmarnock against Hearts

There has been constant speculation regarding the striker after his scoring exploits last season, when he found the back of the net on 31 occasions for Hearts, with another two for Scotland added to the tally.

Speaking after Hearts' 2-1 home win over St Johnstone on Wednesday, Shankland refused to confirm if there were offers on the table from other clubs.

"Possibly, that would be telling right now," he said. "Whether or not, we'll see, it's still early.

"I'm still playing football at the minute as well. I've always been a professional throughout and I would always have that approach and be respectful of the club as well."

Hearts are closing in on appointing Derek McInnes as their new head coach early next week.

Shankland worked with the current Kilmarnock manager when the pair were at Aberdeen, so would McInnes be one of those he would speak to before making a decision?

"Possibly, if that's the case," Shankland said. "I'm sure there'll be a conversation to be had, of course. If I was considering staying at the club, I'll speak to whoever the new manager is.

"We'll see. I'm not promising anything to anyone at the minute.

"I need to go and finish the season with the club and, as I say, we'll take it from there."

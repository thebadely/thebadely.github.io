Here’s what you need to know: World number one Luke Littler was booed during his win over Rob Cross at the 2026 PDC World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace.

The crowd vocally supported 2018 world champion Cross during the match, which led to a passionate celebration from Littler after the 4-2 win that booked his place in the quarter-finals for a third consecutive year.

The sound of boos has not been uncommon in recent weeks or previous editions of the World Championship, with crowds supporting the underdog in the hope of an upset.

"I'm not bothered [by the booing]. Really not bothered. You guys pay for tickets and you pay for my prize so thanks for booing me," the 18-year-old told Sky Sports following his victory.

"No-one wanted me to win but I proved them wrong yet again."

Belgium's Mike de Decker, the world number 18 and 2024 World Grand Prix champion, complained on Instagram about the boos after he was beaten in the first round by unranked Kenyan David Munyua.

He said that booing "shouldn't be something that's normal or supported".

Littler has previously been subjected to booing in overseas tournaments and world number nine Gerwyn Price famously wore ear defenders in 2023 to block out the crowd noise.

Littler said after the match that he may have wound the crowd up too early during his match against Cross.

"They want the underdogs to win, they want the favourites to go out," said Littler.

"I just had to get it out of the way and get my job done. I think that's the first time I've been at the World Championship and the crowd haven't wanted me to win."

"I expect the worst on New Year's Day."

Fellow former world champion Michael van Gerwen was also booed in his first round win over Japanese outsider Mitsuhiko Tatsunami, while Littler's mother took to social media on Tuesday to criticise the fans' booing.

So, why is it happening so often this year?

"They are looking for the underdog to win, but they're all going to be underdogs when they play Luke Littler," two-time world champion Dennis Priestley told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"When he's up against it... he seems to find the answers. That's a world star, a world number one and possibly a two-time world champion, which we will soon see in a few more days.

"He's only a young lad and he's not been on the scene that long. There's a lot to learn and he realises that. 

"It's so remarkable the head he's got on his shoulders, he's got a man's head that's 40 years old with all of his experience that he's packed in over the last 18 months."

Players have previously been encouraged to tolerate the boos rather than complain about being on the wrong side of the Alexandra Palace crowd.

"They've got to get used to it because this is what darts is about," former PDC chairman Barry Hearn told Talksport last year after Scotland's Cameron Menzies was booed during a defeat by Leonard Gates of the United States.

"It's a party atmosphere with a world-class sport going on at the same time. It's a unique mixture that has made us successful," he said.

BBC Sport has approached the PDC for comment.

'It's the first time the crowd haven't wanted me to win'

Players, including former world champion Michael Smith, have whistled back at fans

While there has been a rise in booing, they have often been accompanied by off-putting whistles from the crowd.

Players including world number two and 2024 champion Luke Humphries have been on the receiving end and after Littler's win, Sky Sports commentator Stuart Pyke criticised fans who abuse players and whistle during matches, calling them "mindless idiots".

"We have seen it creep into the sport more and more over the last 12 months," Pyke posted on TikTok.

"Come and have a great time, enjoy yourself, have a beer, sing and shout, but what are you doing? If you see people doing it, tell the stewards, get them to kick them out.

"It is ruining it for the players, it is ruining it for the tournament and it is ruining it for all the other fans."

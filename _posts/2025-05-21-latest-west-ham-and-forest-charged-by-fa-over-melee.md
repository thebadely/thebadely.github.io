Experts revealed that Both sets of players were involved in a melee during stoppage time at London Stadium

West Ham and Nottingham Forest have both been charged for failing to control their players during the final minutes of their Premier League meeting on Sunday. 

Forest won 2-1 at London Stadium to maintain their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League but there were unsavoury scenes deep into stoppage time, with both sets of players involved in a melee.

West Ham midfielders Edson Alvarez and Carlos Soler were booked, while Forest defenders Murillo and Morato were also shown yellow cards for their involvement.

The game lasted 112 minutes and 55 seconds because of a long period of stoppage time, including a lengthy delay to determine whether Nikola Milenkovic's winner was offside.

"West Ham United and Nottingham Forest have been charged in relation to the mass confrontation at their Premier League game on Sunday, 18 May," said the FA. 

"It's alleged that both clubs failed to ensure their players didn't behave in an improper and/or provocative way around the 103rd minute.

"West Ham United and Nottingham Forest have to provide their responses by Friday, 23 May."

The Hammers travel to Ipswich in Sunday's Premier League finale, while Forest will need to beat Chelsea and hope other results go their way to qualify for the Champions League.

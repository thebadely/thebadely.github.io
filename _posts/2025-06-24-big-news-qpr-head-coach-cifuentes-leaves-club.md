Experts revealed that Marti Cifuentes had been on gardening leave at QPR since 29 April

Queens Park Rangers head coach Marti Cifuentes has left the Championship club.

The 42-year-old was placed on gardening leave after the Hoops' final home game of the season, a 5-0 defeat against Burnley in April.

It is understood former Rennes and Strasbourg head coach Julien Stephan will become their new boss.

"The decision to place Marti on gardening leave towards the end of the season was not an easy one to make," chief executive Christian Nourry told the club's website, external.

"As we now move forwards, I would like to thank Marti wholeheartedly for having a positive impact during his two years here.

"He did a fantastic job to help us remain in the division when we he first came in under difficult circumstances, and he worked hard to repeat that again in 2024-25.

"We wish him well for whatever comes next."

Cifuentes steered QPR to 18th and 15th-placed finishes

Cifuentes replaced Gareth Ainsworth at Loftus Road in October 2023 with the club second from bottom in the Championship.

The Spaniard guided the Rs clear of relegation and to an 18th-placed finish, securing safety with a memorable 4-0 win at home to Leeds United.

Like last season, this one was slow to get going.

The Rs recorded just two victories in their opening 16 league games and went almost three months without a win, leaving them bottom of the table in November.

But a 2-0 win in Cardiff saw Zan Celar score his first goals since joining the club in the summer and began a run of 10 wins in 18 matches which lifted them up to 11th - three points off the play-offs.

Established players such as Jake Clarke-Salter, Ilias Chair and Jack Colback have been missing for large chunks through injury.

The two recognised strikers, Michael Frey and Celar, were also ruled out for substantial periods, meaning young players such as Rayan Kolli and Kieran Morgan have come in.

QPR's form dipped again towards the end of the season, with two wins in Cifuentes' last 12 matches in charge.

Reports had begun to link him with a move away from Loftus Road, but he said, "As long as I'm wanted, I'm very happy", and insisted it was important he and the club were aligned in their approach moving forward.

A 5-0 hammering at home to the title-chasing Clarets in the Hoops' penultimate game of the season proved to be the final curtain, as Cifuentes waved goodbye to the fans in a lap of honour that signalled a painful end to his time at the club. 

Assistant coaches Kevin Betsy and Xavi Calm took charge on the last day of the season as the Rs won 1-0 at Sunderland.

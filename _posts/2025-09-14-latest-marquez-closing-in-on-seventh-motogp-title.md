Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Marc Marquez won the first of his six MotoGP titles in 2013.

Marc Marquez moved closer to a seventh MotoGP title with victory in the San Marino Grand Prix.

The win moved Marquez to 512 points - a record tally for a MotoGP rider in a single season - and 182 points clear at the top of the standings with six races remaining. 

The Ducati rider will have a chance to seal the title at the Japanese Grand Prix later this month and draw level with MotoGP great Valentino Rossi's haul of championships.

After starting fourth on the grid for Sunday's race, Spaniard Marquez surged past Fabio Quartararo and brother Alex Marquez shortly after the start, before overtaking Marco Bezzecchi on lap 12.

The 32-year-old had skidded off the track after overtaking Bezzecchi in Saturday's sprint, but this time he made no mistake to secure a 99th career win and 11th of the season.

Aprilia rider Bezzecchi held on to second, comfortably ahead of Gresini Racing's Alex Marquez in third.

Here’s what you need to know: Darcy Graham's try proved crucial in the end for Edinburgh

Edinburgh defeated Benetton in the United Rugby Championship to ease the pressure on head coach Sean Everitt - but were made to sweat at Stadio Monigo.

Successive losses to Scottish rivals Glasgow Warriors contributed to a three-match losing run in all competitions.

Ben Vellacott went over off a ruck and Ross Thompson added the conversion.

A Thompson penalty soon followed and the visitors took a 10-point lead into the break.

Darcy Graham used footwork to force Edinburgh's second try early in the second half, but Thompson missed the conversion.

Benetton responded with their first converted try, with prop Thomas Gallo finding a gap to score and Jacob Umaga added the extras.

And the hosts crossed again as Malakai Fekitoa touched down. Umaga's conversion brought the hosts back to within a point with 23 minutes to play.

It was set up for a tense finish but Edinburgh held firm to record their first URC victory since late November, with Thompson's replacement Cammy Scott missing a late penalty.

Edinburgh move on to three wins from eight in the division this season.

Everitt's side return to Champions Cup action over the next two Fridays, at home to Gloucester then away to Bath.

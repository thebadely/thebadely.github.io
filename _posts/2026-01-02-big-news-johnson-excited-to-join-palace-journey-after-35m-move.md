Here’s what you need to know: Brennan Johnson has scored 27 goals in 107 appearances for Tottenham

Brennan Johnson is set to be included in Crystal Palace's squad to face Newcastle on Sunday after the forward's club-record Â£35m move from Tottenham was finalised on Friday.

Bournemouth were also keen to sign the Wales international as a replacement for Manchester City target Antoine Semenyo. 

But, after talks with Palace boss Oliver Glasner on Thursday, Johnson was persuaded to move to Selhurst Park.

"I'm really excited and I'm really happy," said the 24-year-old. 

"Crystal Palace are such a great club, one that I've always admired.

"It's a great time for me to be here and join the journey that this club is on - I'm super excited."

Johnson's arrival eclipses the Â£27m the Eagles paid for Liverpool striker Christian Benteke in 2016 as their record transfer. 

He joined Spurs in a Â£47.5m deal from Nottingham Forest in 2023 and scored the winner as the club ended their 17-year wait for silverware with Europa League success last season. 

But Johnson's minutes have been limited under Spurs manager Thomas Frank this term, with the frontman scoring four goals in 22 appearances.

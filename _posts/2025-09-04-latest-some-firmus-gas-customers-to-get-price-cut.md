Here’s what you need to know: Firmus Energy has announced its gas price in the Ten Towns area will fall by almost 8% in October, which is the equivalent to £78 a year for a typical customer.

The price cut follows a review by the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator.

The regulator imposes price controls on the major incumbent suppliers - electricity firm Power NI; SSE Gas in Belfast and the west; and Firmus in the Ten Towns network.

The Ten Towns area includes Antrim, Armagh, Banbridge, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Newry, Londonderry and more than 25 other towns and villages in the surrounding area.

Announcements in relation to tariffs for NI Power and SSE are expected on Friday, while Firmus are expected to announce prices for Belfast customers in the coming weeks. 

Colin Broomfield, director of markets at the Utility Regulator, said it was recognised that many businesses and households are still struggling with energy costs. 

"If you are worried about paying for your electricity or gas, we would encourage you to contact your supplier in the first instance, to make them aware of your circumstances, and discuss the options available," he said. 

Ryan Miskimmin, from Firmus Energy, said the group was "committed to passing on any savings to customers". 

"Since April this year, our consecutive reductions have decreased our tariffs by almost 19%, representing an average household saving of £210 per year," he said.

"As we head into the colder months, we know that these savings coupled with the constant heat and instant hot water that natural gas provides, will be welcomed by Ten Towns customers."

Scorecard. Table

Birmingham Phoenix fell to the biggest defeat in terms of runs in the history of The Hundred women's competition as they lost by 88 runs to London Spirit.

Opener Kira Chathli hit 69 from 35 balls, while the big-hitting Grace Harris made 34 from 15 as Spirit posted 164-6.

Phoenix offered no challenge in their chase, with only Emma Lamb (23) passing 10 as they were bowled out for 76 with 21 balls remaining.

Spirit captain Charlie Dean chose to bat after winning the toss, but her side lost Georgia Redmayne and Cordelia Griffith for nought and nine respectively, reaching 25-2 at the end of the powerplay.

Chathli steadied the ship, striking 13 fours, and put on a partnership of 47 from 21 with Harris.

She was caught behind ramping off Ellyse Perry, while Harris became Em Arlott's third victim as she took 3-25, but Spirit finished on a strong 164-6.

Phoenix opener Georgia Voll was caught by Chathli off Issy Wong from the 10th ball of the innings and the home side lost regular wickets from that point, with six batters dismissed for single figures.

Megan Schutt and Hannah Baker were dismissed from successive balls to leave Phoenix 76-9, and with debutant Phoebe Brett absent with a thumb injury that completed a comprehensive Spirit victory.

The win takes defending champions Spirit from fourth to top, ahead of Southern Brave on net run-rate, while Phoenix remain seventh with one win from five games.

Superchargers miss chance to move top after defeat to Originals

The Hundred women's competition, Old Trafford

Manchester Originals 117-5 (100 balls): Dottin 51* (26); Cross 2-21

Nothern Superchargers 112-7 (100 balls): Litchfield 31 (27); Kerr 2-20

Manchester Originals won by five runs

Scorecard. Table

Northern Superchargers missed the chance to move top of the table, falling to a five-run defeat by Manchester Originals at Old Trafford.

Chasing 118, the visiting side had looked set for victory after Phoebe Litchfield and Alice Davidson-Richards put on 64 for the second wicket.

But Litchfield's dismissal by Melie Kerr began a spell where Superchargers lost four wickets for 17 runs and saw their chase stall. 

Needing 14 from the final 10 balls, Sophie Ecclestone had Bess Heath caught superbly by Deandra Dottin and Lauren Filer removed Kate Cross as Superchargers fell short.  

Earlier, Cross had got her side off to a strong side after Superchargers chose to bowl, dismissing both Originals openers for single figures.

Captain Beth Mooney was bowled by the former Originals seamer and Kathryn Bryce was caught behind.

Having only reached 58-4 from 64 balls, Dottin powered the Originals to a respectable score, hammering 51 from 26 as they finished on 117-5. 

It proved to be a total Originals could defend, and they now move fourth with three wins from five games, while Superchargers drop to third.

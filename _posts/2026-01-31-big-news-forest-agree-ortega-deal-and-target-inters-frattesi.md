Here’s what you need to know: Stefan Ortega has won two Premier League titles at Manchester City

Nottingham Forest have agreed a deal for Manchester City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega worth up to Â£500,000.

Sean Dyche's side are also trying to sign Inter Milan midfielder Davide Frattesi, initially on loan with the option for a permanent transfer.

The 26-year-old has won 33 caps for Italy and has played 19 games for Inter this season.

German Ortega, 33, is currently third choice at the Etihad behind Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford.

He is out of contract this summer and is yet to feature for Pep Guardiola's side this season.

Forest's need for a keeper stems from a knee injury suffered by John Victor that is set to rule him out for the rest of the season. 

The City Ground club had held talks with Wolves over a move for Jose Sa, but have since pivoted to Ortega.

Ortega has played 56 games for City since joining in 2022 and played a key role in their Premier League title win in 2024.

He played 22 games last season, including appearances in the Club World Cup in July and the FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace.

Forest, who are in the Europa League play-offs and are 17th in the Premier League, have already signed Napoli striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan and had a bid of Â£35m rejected by Crystal Palace for striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.

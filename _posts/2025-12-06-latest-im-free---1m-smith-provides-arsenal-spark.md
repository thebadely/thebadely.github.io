Blackstenius scores late winner as Arsenal beat Liverpool

It was an all too familiar story for Arsenal on Saturday as they struggled to break down Liverpool's low block.

Three shots on target and one off the woodwork inside the opening quarter of an hour of the Women's Super League game, but no goal.

The exasperation of the home fans was tangible.

Then a moment of magic from Olivia Smith lifted the mood from frustration to pure elation.

The first first Â£1m player in women's football showed every bit of her star quality as she wriggled past several of her former Liverpool team-mates before breaking the deadlock with a brilliant strike from distance.

"You felt she was going to have a big impact on this game," former Tottenham captain Jenna Schillaci told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Smith was rightly named player of the match in the 2-1 win at Emirates Stadium, testament to her impact throughout.

Arsenal defeat Liverpool with late winner from Blackstenius

Olivia Smith was the first Â£1m signing in women's football

Since her summer arrival from Liverpool, 21-year-old Smith has shown glimpses of the star quality that made Arsenal sign her, but several injury issues have blighted the early months of her career in north London.

Her latest setback came during the October international break when she limped off during Canada's 1-0 defeat by Switzerland with a hip injury.

However, after deciding not to travel for her country's games against Netherlands and Japan in the past two weeks, there were no such signs of bother for Smith against Liverpool as she ran both of their full-backs ragged all afternoon.

"She is totally fit - injury-free. You could see that on the pitch. She moved very freely. I'm really happy for her," Arsenal manager Renee Slegers told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It was a very good goal. We know when she plays from the left she can do these kinds of things.

"From the right, it is more about one-v-ones and going around and getting crosses in, and she did both for us today."

Smith's creativity was a bright spark on a largely frustrating afternoon for the Gunners.

"I'm enjoying it. I'm free," Smith told Sky Sports. "Renee wants from time to go one-v-one and be creative, and I'm able to do that.

"I'm really happy to get back on the scoresheet and (I want) to try and continue that run for the games going forward."

Smith created two chances as well as scoring the opening goal

After scoring a stunning goal on her debut against London City Lionesses in September, Smith has found it difficult to convert her positive running into goal contributions.

That said, she is providing a creative spark for an Arsenal side who routinely struggle to break down low-block defences.

Her second-half cameo against Tottenham two weeks ago produced two big chances which her team-mates spurned, while Smith was denied twice by Spurs keeper Lize Kop.

Against Liverpool Smith's goal contributions could well have tripled had Mariona Caldentey's first-half header or Caitlin Foord's late snapshot beaten keeper Faye Kirby.

There were also many mazy runs down both flanks that led to dangerous deliveries into the area which on another day could have resulted in further goals.

"She's definitely a talent who can create magic," former Arsenal midfielder Rachel Yankey told Sky Sports. "For her, it's just about being positive.

"As much as her scoring, she's there as a team player, trying to assist and set people up, put in crosses. There's so much more to come."

According to new developments, Olivia Smith (left) and Chloe Kelly (right) could be involved in the WSL transfer window

The Women's Super League transfer window has opened again for the summer and there could be plenty of movement after Euro 2025.

A number of big-name stars are playing in Switzerland, but will any of them be switching clubs?

The window opened on Wednesday and closes at 23:00 BST on Thursday, 4 September. Here are some things to look out for.

After a dramatic deadline day loan exit from Manchester City to Arsenal in January, England international Chloe Kelly is likely to make that move a permanent one.

European champions Arsenal have held positive discussions with Kelly's representatives for some time now and the forward has made it clear how happy she is at the club.

"They took me from a really dark place and gave me an opportunity, but we achieved incredible things together, so let's see what happens," said Kelly, when asked about her future on Tuesday.

Kelly might not be the only addition for Arsenal this summer as they are looking to strengthen their defensive options.

Liverpool's Taylor Hinds is a target and the Reds vice-captain is yet to agree a new deal on Merseyside, despite being offered a contract extension.

Arsenal are also interested in Liverpool sensation Olivia Smith, but they are not the only ones with Chelsea and National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) clubs keen.

Liverpool do not wish to sell the Canada international, who they signed for a club-record Â£210,000 last summer on a three-year deal, but they will have to fight to keep hold of her.

WSL champions Chelsea are also expected to be active in the window and have been interested in USA teenager and Ajax midfielder Lily Yohannes for a while. However, reports suggest, external they will face competition from OL Lyonnes.

There have been discussions between Chelsea and OL Lyonnes about a potential swap-deal involving Blues full-back Ashley Lawrence and Australian Ellie Carpenter.

Newly-promoted side London City Lionesses are looking to make their mark in the window and have had discussions with Norway defender Ingrid Engen, who confirmed her exit from Barcelona this month. She has also been heavily linked with sister club OL Lyonnes.

England goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck could leave Barcelona this summer, just six months after joining, as she seeks regular game time. A return to the WSL is not ruled out. 

London City Lionesses owner Michele Kang intends to be very busy during the window, also overseeing business at Washington Spirit and OL Lyonnes.

She wants to back London City in the market and admitted their promotion to the WSL makes recruitment "much easier".

"A lot of top players didn't want to join a Championship team. Now we are in the WSL I think it is going to be easier to recruit," she told BBC Sport in May.

Manchester City need to bridge the gap extended by rivals Chelsea and Arsenal last season and are expected to strengthen.

They are in the market for a midfielder, as well as more defensive cover.

Everton, under the new ownership of the Friedkin Group, are confident of adding several new additions, with manager Brian Sorensen describing their summer as "active" in an interview with the Athletic, external last month, stating up to eight new players could join.

Manchester United boss Marc Skinner promised fans a "big summer" in terms of recruitment as he looks to build a squad capable of competing in the Champions League this season.

After sealing European qualification in May, he said: "The next step is that we have to recruit the right way. In order to go into the depths of the Champions League - and from our perspective actually qualify for the group stages - we have to add the quality of depth.

"Champions League gives you that. People want to come to a Champions League team. Hopefully it opens that market for us."

It could be a tricky few months for Liverpool as they hope to agree contract extensions with regular starters Hinds, Fuka Nagano and Ceri Holland, as well as fend off interest in Smith.

Asked about the latest regarding Nagano's future in May, interim manager Amber Whiteley said: "Progress is still ongoing with Fuka and that is the same with a couple of others."

Experts revealed that The regulator will be given new powers over Premier League parachute payments to relegated clubs

David Kogan has been appointed as the first chair of English football's new independent regulator.

The sports media rights executive was named as the government's preferred choice in April, but faced a "full inquiry" by the Commissioner for Public Appointments which remains ongoing.

Kogan revealed he had contributed money to the Labour Party leadership campaign of Secretary of State Lisa Nandy in 2020, along with that of the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

In a statement Kogan said: "There are urgent and critical issues that need addressing in football, and I look forward to working with all stakeholders to achieve the right solutions for a more sustainable industry."

In April Nandy said Kogan was the "outstanding candidate" to fill the position, despite not being on the original three-person shortlist.

A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport told BBC Sport: "The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee found David Kogan appointable after his scrutiny hearing and we are now pleased to proceed in announcing him as chair.

"It is vital that the work to set up the regulator continues at pace to strengthen the governance of the national game and for that we need a chair in post and a board put in place.

"We have co-operated fully with the inquiry by the Commissioner of Public Appointments and await the report's publication."

In May Kogan told MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (CMS) during a pre-appointment hearing that he was being "utterly transparent" by declaring his donations.

The committee endorsed Kogan but said he must work to "reassure the football community that he will act impartially and in a politically neutral way".

Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage warned that Kogan's "past donations to the Labour Party will inevitably leave him open to charges of political bias in a job where independence is paramount".

Kogan said he had donated "very small sums" to the campaigns, as well as thousands of pounds to Labour MPs and candidates in recent years, but had "total personal independence from all of them" and pledged "total political impartiality" if appointed.

However, his proposed appointment was criticised by the Conservative Party, with  Shadow Culture Minister Stuart Andrew saying it was "Labour cronyism".

"The public has a right to know whether this was a fair and impartial process, or yet another case of political patronage disguised as due diligence," he said.

Kogan, who will be paid a Â£130,000 salary for a three-day week, has been appointed for a five-year term until 19 May 2030. Dame Helen Stephenson and Simon Levine have also been appointed to the board.

One of Kogan's biggest priorities is expected to be Sheffield Wednesday. Last month Nandy warned owner Dejphon Chansiri that "change is coming" amid continued calls for the Thai businessman to sell the cash-strapped Championship club.

Various embargoes have been placed on the club for tax debts and late payments to players and staff.

Last week it was revealed that player and staff wages were again not paid on time for the fifth time in seven months.

Nandy said that "if necessary, the football regulator can intervene in order to remove an owner who is threatening the future of the club".

She said: "In Sheffield Wednesday's case, I am really extremely concerned about the current ownership and the lack of willingness to sell the club and invest in the club, something I've been discussing very closely with local MPs."

The regulator was a recommendation of a fan-led review into the game with a bill introduced in March 2024 by the then Conservative government, but it failed to pass through Parliament before a general election was called later that year.

The Labour government reintroduced the bill four months later and it became law in July. The Football Governance Act granted powers to a body that is independent from government and football authorities.

The regulator is intended to improve financial sustainability across the football pyramid and will also stop clubs from joining breakaway competitions, like the attempted European Super League proposal in 2021, which was roundly criticised by fans.

Kogan will also be expected to help the English Football League (EFL) and Premier League reach an agreement on a new funding deal.

In its passage through Parliament, there was opposition from some Conservatives.

West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady told the House of Lords there were "dangers lurking" in the bill, arguing it would affect competition. The Premier League was also critical of the need for a regulator.

Kogan has held senior positions in the television and sports industries during a 45-year career as an executive, and negotiated a succession of multi-billion pound TV rights deals on behalf of major sporting bodies, including the Premier League and the EFL.

He also advised Uefa, the Scottish Premier League, Six Nations, Premier Rugby and the NFL. Most recently, he sold the broadcast rights on behalf of the Woman's Super League.

He is a former managing director of Reuters Television and the author of three books.

This year he told MPs that the expanded Club World Cup and Champions League are "risk factors" for the sustainability of English football, saying the growth of these competitions will have an impact on the money English football earns from broadcast deals.

Kogan also claimed the regulator's powers to evaluate owners and directors will be far more extensive, with "access to much greater knowledge and much greater ability to intervene", but warned that it may face legal challenges from clubs.

He said the regulator would not set ticket prices, but that he is considering a "fan representative" on the board.

"I think it's a very good appointment," Football Supporters' Association (FSA) chair Tom Greatrex told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Greatrex said he has "no concerns" about Kogan's history in the Labour Party, describing him as a "robust character" who won't be "leaned on".

"He's well known as someone who was in the Labour Party, but more importantly to do with this, it's his qualification for the role, which is a vitally important role for the sustainability of English football. He is the right person for the job," added Greatrex.

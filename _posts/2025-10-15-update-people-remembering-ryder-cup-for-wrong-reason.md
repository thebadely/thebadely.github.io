Hereâ€™s what you need to know: McIlroy was targeted by a hostile New York crowd throughout last month's Ryder Cup

Rory McIlroy says he wants to "shift the narrative" after claiming people are remembering Europe's Ryder Cup win in New York last month for the "wrong reason". 

McIlroy bore the brunt of verbal abuse from a hostile crowd throughout the event at Bethpage Black and hit out at "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" after his wife Erica was hit by a drink thrown by an American fan.

Speaking on Wednesday before his first tournament since the Ryder Cup, McIlroy said the focus on the fans' behaviour detracts from a rare European win on American soil. 

"The unfortunate thing is people aren't remembering that [performance] and they are remembering the week for the wrong reason," said the Northern Irishman, who contributed three-and-a-half points as Europe won 15-13. 

"I would like to shift the narrative and focus on how good the European team were and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup."

Asked if he thinks people no longer watch sport purely for enjoyment, McIlroy said he believes the "majority" of fans tune in because it is impossible to predict the outcome, but admitted interests such as gambling have changed the way it is consumed. 

"Knowing that you're going to get criticised for your performances, athletes have to do a better job of blocking out the noise," said the 36-year-old. 

"So not going on social media, trying not to read anything about yourself, it's easier said than done.

"But the more athletes can do that, I think it's better for their performance, for their mental health, and for their longevity in a given sport."

While McIlroy has been inspired by the "effort and dedication" Luke Donald has brought to the captaincy, he does not expect to lead Europe for another decade

Europe's victory at Bethpage Black was McIlroy's sixth in eight Ryder Cup appearances and second in America after also playing in 2012's memorable triumph at Medinah. 

Speaking on Tuesday, Donald - who also led Europe to their 2023 win in Rome - said McIlroy would make a "good captain", but the world number two does not expect to take the reins until the "mid-2030s". 

"Certainly not 2027 [at Adare Manor in Ireland]," he laughed when asked if he would like to lead the side. 

"I hope I'm still playing at that point and good enough to put points on the board for Europe. But yeah, I would love to be the European team captain at some point.

"But that will be when I'm not good enough to make the team, or I make way for the new generation to come along."

McIlroy is returning to action at this week's DP World Tour's India Championship - a new tournament - alongside Ryder Cup team-mates Shane Lowry, Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland. 

Grouped with Hovland and US Ryder Cup player Ben Griffin, McIlroy begins Thursday's first round at Delhi Golf Club at 02:55 BST.

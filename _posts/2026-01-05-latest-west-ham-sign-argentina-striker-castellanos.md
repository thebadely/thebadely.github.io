Experts revealed that Taty Castellanos scored two goals and provided three assists in 10 Serie A appearances this season

West Ham have signed Lazio striker Valentin 'Taty' Castellanos for an undisclosed fee on a four-and-a-half-year contract, with the option for a further year.

The 27-year-old joined Lazio in 2023 and made 98 appearances, scoring 22 goals and providing 16 assists.

Castellanos, who has won two caps for Argentina since making his debut in 2024, has also played for New York City FC and Girona.

West Ham said head coach Nuno Espirito Santo identified Castellanos as "a key target".

Castellanos said he will "give everything" to the club.

"Every match is a battle, and I'm here to contribute that, to try to bring that energy, that fighting spirit I have inside, so that every match is as important and as tough as possible," he said.

Castellanos is Nuno's second January signing following the arrival of Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente for a reported 25m euros (Â£22m).

West Ham are 18th in the Premier League as they prepare for Tuesday's match against Nottingham Forest, who are four points above them in 17th.

Let's dive into the details: Sometimes as a pundit you can still be really positive about a team's performance even when they lose, and Manchester United's 1-0 defeat by Arsenal is a good example of that.

After conceding a silly early goal that ultimately proved decisive, United showed on Sunday that their system works and also demonstrated the difference their new signings will make to it.

As I said on Match of the Day, they were more dynamic and more direct. Physically, they looked really strong too.

Essentially, they were able to be much braver when they tried to win the ball back because they have got much more quality higher up the pitch.

Yes, they still lost and did not score, but United were the better team at Old Trafford and will feel desperately unlucky they did not get anything out of the game.

Why Man Utd fans should be feeling positive after opening performance

Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha made their United debuts against Arsenal. Another summer signing, Benjamin Sesko, replaced Mason Mount after 65 minutes

We know United boss Ruben Amorim is not going to deviate from his 3-4-2-1 formation, and they were in the same shape again here.

What was different about United this time was they were much more positive in the way they were set up, whether they were in or out of possession.

For a start, their wing-backs Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu were really high up the pitch, and Amad Diallo was even more attack-minded when he replaced Dalot early in the second half.

Amorim took a risk by pressing a team as good as Arsenal like that, and in the first half they got caught on the break a few times, when the Gunners beat their press and had overloads that they did not make the most of.

But United were at home, so they should be on the front foot and what I really liked about them was how they took the game to Arsenal, in a way they rarely did against the top teams last season - even when they won.

Yes, United occasionally looked a bit ragged but, overall, the balance of the team was right and their energy was extremely high.

If they are to progress, they have to play with this kind of positivity all the time, and trust that their front players will eventually turn the great positions they find themselves in into goals.

United's new signings who started the game played a huge part in their improved performance.

I know it is only one game, but Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looked like the players United hope they will be.

I am a big fan of what Mikel Arteta has done at Arsenal and for many seasons now one of their strengths has been that, in most of the games they play, they control possession and dictate the tempo to the opposition.

They did not have that control at Old Trafford, however, because of United's energy, bravery and willingness to try to go after them. All of that helped Amorim's side defensively too.

Lots of times last season when United tried to play out from the back, they were constantly caught in possession. We hardly saw that happen on Sunday.

With Cunha and Mbeumo, there was a more physical presence at the top of the pitch, with lots of pace and runners who wanted to get behind Arsenal's defence.

Man Utd recorded 22 shots against Arsenal on Sunday, their most in a Premier League match against the Gunners since they had 25 in an 8-2 win in August 2011

Last season, United's front line was pretty non-existent. Teams were not scared of them so they would just run all over them.

They now have quality players in attack who are full of confidence, who can frighten opposition defenders. That gives them respect straight away.

You could see that against the Gunners. With United looking to get the ball forward quickly, Arsenal's defenders were worried about Cunha and Mbeumo so they sat in rather than trying to get forward to kill the game off.

The United wing-backs were always willing to get forward in support too, knowing Cunha and Mbeumo were going to keep the ball. Mason Mount had an excellent game too, which was another big positive.

As it went on, you felt more and more like a United equaliser was coming.

Despite having 22 shots, it did not quite happen for them, but it still felt like their attack is more dangerous - and when Benjamin Sesko is fully fit he will add even more firepower.

Of course there are still some question marks over United - they clearly were not perfect because they lost.

They may need a new central midfielder to replace Manuel Ugarte or Casemiro, because I know not everyone thinks they are the ideal fit alongside Bruno Fernandes, who might need someone more powerful to do a bit more running for him.

There are doubts over their goalkeeper situation too, which cost them again here with Altay Bayindir's mistake for Riccardo Calafiori's winner.

It is frustrating to lose to a goal like that anyway, but especially because it is something that has happened to them before.

However, while there was disappointment on the day, this was still a game that gives United plenty to build on.

Of course you always want results, but you also want to see some progress - especially at this extremely early stage of the season - and United's display showed plenty of that.

Right now progress means the team getting better and more used to the manager's system, with the players becoming comfortable in their relationships on the pitch, and the new signings bedding in.

It is also about them putting their struggles of last season behind them, and playing with some confidence and belief.

All of that happened against Arsenal. 

Although they lost, they played like they thought they could win, and every team who plays against them now is going to be wary.

Experts revealed that England manager Sarina Wiegman (left) and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton both won awards at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Paris

England manager Sarina Wiegman has been named women's coach of the year at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards, while Hannah Hampton collected the Yashin Trophy for best goalkeeper.

The Lionesses beat Spain 3-1 on penalties after the final finished 1-1 after extra time to win Euro 2025 in Switzerland, with Chelsea goalkeeper Hampton, 24, saving two of Spain's efforts in the shootout.

For Wiegman, 55, it was the second time she had guided England to European glory after doing so on home soil in 2022.

She won the award ahead of four coaches, with Chelsea's Sonia Bompastor and Arsenal's Renee Slegers among those also named.

Gunners goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar was one of the players Hampton beat to the Yashin Trophy, along with former Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger.

England striker Michelle Agyemang, who scored vital goals in the Euro 2025 quarter-final against Sweden and in the semi-final against Italy, had been nominated for the Kopa Trophy to celebrate the best young player, but that went to 19-year-old Barcelona and Spain winger Vicky Lopez.

Five of the England squad were named in the top 10 of the main women's Ballon d'Or prize for the best player of the year.

Arsenal forward Alessia Russo came third, with Arsenal winger Chloe Kelly fifth, Gunners defender Leah Williamson seventh, Chelsea full-back Lucy Bronze ninth and Hampton in 10th spot.

Arsenal, who beat Barcelona to win the Women's Champions League, were honoured by winning women's club of the year.

Hampton's rise to best goalkeeper in the world

England retain European title with dramatic win over Spain

Wiegman, speaking on stage after collecting her trophy, said: "What an honour to get this award after a very special summer, and even more of an insane tournament we had at the Euros in Switzerland.

"First of all I would like to thank the players, the staff, the FA and my family for the hard work, the trust and the unconditional support. Without you I would not be standing here.

"The women's game has grown so far we have broken records. I would also like to thank Switzerland for organising the Euros because it was absolutely insane.

"This is not just a personal honour - I see it as a recognition of the women's game, of our journey and where we have come so far."

Wiegman, who has been England manager since 2021, also talked about the rise of the women's game and the challenges it still faces.

She added: "With that recognition we have to take responsibility and try to keep our identity. Being authentic, being inclusive, a place where everyone belongs. I hope we will keep fighting together against misogyny and racism. Sport should always unite and never divide."

Wiegman said the award "means even more" as it was named after Dutch compatriot Johan Cruyff, who won the men's Ballon d'Or prize for being the best player in the world three times in the 1970s.

"He believed in the power of sport and believed in every kid having the opportunity to play, to grow and to belong, and that is why I feel so connected with him," said Wiegman.

"I would like to say let's keep moving forward, keep uniting our beautiful game and enjoying our beautiful game too. Let's celebrate our successes too."

Matt Beard guided Liverpool to the Women's Super League title in 2013 and 2014

The Yashin Trophy was presented to a women's player for the first time in 2025, with Hampton collecting the award from former England goalkeeper Mary Earps.

In her acceptance speech, Hampton paid tribute to Matt Beard, the former Chelsea, Liverpool, West Ham and Bristol City manager, who died on Saturday aged 47.

"The women's game sadly on Saturday lost a real trailblazer, Matt Beard," said Hampton. "Matt was someone who cared an awful lot for the women's game when no-one else did. He lit up the room whenever he was in it. 

"And this is just a message to show that not everyone should have to go through these dark moments alone. Sometimes the brightest smiles in the room hide the heaviest pain. He'll be greatly missed."

Born with a serious eye condition, Hampton was told by doctors she should not play football. She had multiple operations to try to correct her vision but it is not perfect and she still has depth perception issues.

"Firstly I would like to say a massive thank you to France Football for this award," said Hampton, who thanked all the coaches and her family members. "I don't think it's an achievement for me but for women's goalkeeping, that the award is finally now taking part.

"I stand on the shoulders of so many great goalkeepers of the past. Sitting alongside my fellow nominees, I'm proud to be a part of such an incredible group and inspiring future generations of goalkeepers coming through and training so hard.

"I'd like to thank my family, my brother - who is here tonight - for the sacrifices that you made when I was growing up, driving me around everywhere so that I could fulfil my dream and be here tonight.

"To all the coaches, there's so many. To Sarina for having the faith in me over the summer, with the success we've had. To the fans - your support does not go unnoticed and it truly means a lot.

"Finally, to Grandpa. I love and miss you every day. I hope I made you proud. We did it."

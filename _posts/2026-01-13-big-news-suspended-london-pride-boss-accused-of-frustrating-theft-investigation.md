It has been recently reported that The suspended boss of Pride in London has "frustrated" a disciplinary investigation into alleged theft and bullying by refusing to hand back control of company bank accounts and systems, court documents allege.

Christopher Joell-Deshields appeared at London's High Court on Tuesday accused of not handing back the company's "usernames, passwords and personal identification numbers".

Court papers seen by the BBC show Pride in London's lawyers accuse him of trying to prevent "the full extent of his actions becoming apparent".

The 55-year-old denied one ground of failing to hand over the accounts, but admitted to a second ground of failing to submit a statement verifying he had complied with the order.

In September 2025, London LGBT Community Pride CIC obtained an injunction against the 55-year-old, who is suspended from his role as CEO while a disciplinary investigation continues, which required him to hand back company devices, access to bank accounts and social media profiles.

Lawyers for the organisation, which puts on one of the UK's largest annual pride events, accused Joell-Deshields of two counts of contempt of court for failing to comply with the order.

Dr John Brown, representing Joell-Deshields, said his client would contest the claim he had not returned all that was required, but accepted he had not complied with the requirement to provide a witness statement verifying he had returned the property.

Asked about a laptop which is yet to be returned, Brown said "his case is that, though the laptop was purchased by the company, it was purchased to replace his laptop that was damaged at work".

Deputy judge Tim Maloney KC said a trial on the remaining allegation would take place on the first available date after 10 February.

The hearing will address what sanction Joell-Deshields will face for failing to provide a witness statement, as well as hear Pride in London's argument relating to the first ground for contempt.

A copy of the order seen by the BBC says that disobeying it could lead to imprisonment, fines or assets being seized.

In September 2025, Joell-Deshields was suspended as CEO of Pride in London and removed as director after it was alleged he spent £7,000 worth of vouchers donated by sponsors on luxury perfumes and Apple products.

Volunteers also accused him of sending bullying messages to a disabled volunteer and creating a "toxic" culture at the organisation, which has more than 100 year-round volunteers and a number of paid staff.

The BBC understands that Joell-Deshields is still being paid an annual salary of more than £85,000 by the organisation while the investigation, now in its seventh month, continues.

During an earlier hearing, lawyers representing Joell-Deshields said that their client's cooperation with the court order was not an admission of guilt relating to any of the allegations.

The case comes at a difficult time for Pride organisations which say they are experiencing a drop in financial support and volunteers meaning several events were cancelled or scaled down in 2025.

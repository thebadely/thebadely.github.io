Let's dive into the details: Noah Caluori is an England under-21 international

English rugby union may well have witnessed the birth of a superstar on Saturday.

Teenage winger Noah Caluori scored five tries as he inspired Saracens to a 65-14 win over Sale Sharks on a simply stunning full Premiership debut.

Caluori's 6ft 5in frame was too much for the Sale defence to handle as he ran them ragged time and again, both in the air and on the ground.

Former Wales captain Sam Warburton was so dazzled he thinks England boss Steve Borthwick should call up the 19-year-old for the Autumn internationals.

"I haven't seen a player this good in the air, ever, and he's a teenager," said Warburton in his role as a TNT Sports pundit.

"Get him in the England squad. He's got it. This kid is going to be amazing."

Former England winger Chris Ashton, another TNT pundit, said he was "lost for words" after watching Caluori's explosive performance.

Caluori even emulated ex-Sarries hero Ashton's trademark swan dive scoring celebration - and that's not all Ashton thinks the teenager might take from him.

"He'll only need 20 games to get [my] record if he plays like that," joked Ashton, referencing his own status as all-time top-flight leading try scorer with 101.

"I've seen his ability in the air, but he's gliding past players with ease which you don't see very often. He's scored three or four really good tries, you might get one [normally].

"He's in a great team and, yes, Sale went down to 14 men, but in the first half, Sale didn't know how to deal with his ability in the air. To get five tries on your first start is... I'm lost for words. It is that good.

"Has he set the bar too high?"

Even beaten Sale boss Alex Sanderson could not hide his admiration.

"I don't think it could have gone any better for him. Five tries? He beat us alone in that sense, if you look at the scoreline," Sanderson said.

"Fair play to him, he was brilliant and he was as dangerous with the ball in the wide channels as he was with the ball aerially. He's a rare talent."

Four of Noah Caluori's five tries against Sale came in the second half

Caluori's future looks incredibly bright and it would be easy to see his stunning display as a launching pad for a successful career in club and international rugby.

But Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall warned against such expectations hitting too lofty levels.

"Noah's aerial ability is unique, but everyone has got to take a breath," McCall said.

"He's quite a special player and a great kid as well. He's a very balanced and sensible young fella who is obviously going to get a lot of attention.

"He's capable of dealing with that, but he's not the perfect player yet â far from it.

"He knows he has a lot of things to improve on. His ceiling's absolutely huge, but let's enjoy him and let him grow in the right way."

McCall also warned Caluori needs to be looked after as his burgeoning reputation continues to grow.

"There's a responsibility and duty of care to a very young man, on us as a club and the media as well, to protect him and look after him in the right way," he added.

Caluori was visibly ecstatic with his night's work, and said he would re-live the experience as soon as he could.

"I'm probably going to watch it back and think 'how did this happen?'," Caluori told TNT.

"I just wanted to take the opportunity and make the most out of it. As a team, we had a set goal this week to going back to being ruthless, bouncing back to zero and going again, putting our all into this game.

"I was speaking to my mates back home saying I couldn't believe names like Maro Itoje are my team-mates now. All of us youngsters are trying to learn as much as we can from them."

Itoje might well be his team-mate for both club and country, if Caluori keeps up the form he showed on Saturday.

And for former British & Irish Lions skipper Warburton, that should happen sooner rather than later.

"I cannot believe the height he can get off the ground - he's almost undefendable," Warburton added.

"I've never seen anyone like him. I'm not saying you'd start him, but get him in the [England] environment. I'm telling you now, he's going to be a special player."

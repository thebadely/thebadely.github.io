Let's dive into the details: England beat France 43-42 at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham last month 

England will play two warm-up matches before their home World Cup begins later this summer.

The Red Roses will host Spain at Welford Road in Leicester on 3 August, before facing France in Mont-de-Marsan a week later.

John Mitchell's side beat France by just a point in a final-game thriller last month to secure a fourth consecutive Women's Six Nations Grand Slam.

If England and France top their World Cup pool and win their quarter-finals they will meet in the last four in Bristol.

Spain won the WXV 3 tournament last autumn to qualify for the Women's World Cup for the first time since 2017.

England play the United States in the opening match of the tournament in Sunderland on 22 August.

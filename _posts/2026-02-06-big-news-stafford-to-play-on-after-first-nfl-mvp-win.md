Let's dive into the details: Matthew Stafford has won the Super Bowl and MVP award in five seasons with the Rams

Veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford confirmed he will keep playing for at least one more season after being named the NFL's Most Valuable Player for the first time.

The Los Angeles Rams star was the slight favourite for the award and beat New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye by one first-place vote.

The 37-year-old became the oldest quarterback to win the MVP for the first time and it is the 13th straight win by a QB.

Stafford had been rumoured to be considering retirement and while on stage with his four daughters in San Francisco, said: "I'll see you guys next year." 

"It's something I'd been thinking about, whether I wanted to keep playing or not," he added.

"I ended the season on a healthy note, had a bunch of team-mates in the crowd and my daughters with me, so it felt like the right thing to do in the moment. I'm happy to be coming back."

Stafford was unable to register a play-off win in 12 years with the Detroit Lions, but after being traded to the Rams in 2021, he won the Super Bowl in his first season and has now been named MVP.

The former first overall draft pick is just the second quarterback after Tom Brady (2007) to lead the NFL in touchdown passes, passing yards and touchdown-interception ratio over the past 50 seasons.

He led the Rams to the NFC Championship game but the Seattle Seahawks won to book their spot in Sunday's Super Bowl, where they will face the Patriots in Santa Clara.

Seattle's Jaxon Smith-Njigba was named Offensive Player of the Year at the NFL's end-of-season awards night after leading the league for receiving yards.

New England's Mike Vrabel won Coach of the Year having led the Patriots to the Super Bowl in his first season as their head coach.

Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett was named Defensive Player of the Year for the second time in three years after claiming the single-season sack record.

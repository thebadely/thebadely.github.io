Experts revealed that Lewis Crocker salutes the crowd at Wednesday's open workout in Belfast 

IBF welterweight world title: Lewis Crocker v Paddy Donovan

Venue: Windsor Park, Belfast Date: Saturday, 13 September

Coverage: Live on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra 2, with live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app

Lewis Crocker says he "wasn't good enough" in his first fight against Paddy Donovan, but will be "the best version of myself" in Saturday's rematch at Windsor Park with the IBF world welterweight title at stake.

Crocker won the first fight between the pair at Belfast's SSE Arena in March by way of disqualification as Donovan, who was ahead on all three cards, was thrown out at the end of the ninth round for punching after the bell, having already been deducted points for fouls.

That was a final eliminator for the IBF title which was then in the possession of Jaron 'Boots' Ennis, but with the American opting to vacate and move up to light-middleweight, the all-Irish rematch was upgraded to world title status.

Opinions were split prior to the first meeting as to which of the pair would come out on top, but Donovan goes into Saturday's rematch as a firm favourite.

Crocker acknowledges his performance in March was well below what was required and is determined to produce much better this time.

"I'll leave my talking for the ring," Crocker said.

"I'm ready to put on the biggest performance of my life on Saturday.

"I wasn't good enough the last time so I need to be much better in all aspects. You are going to get the best version of myself. I've banked rounds with him, so I know what to expect. I'm ready."

Both men went through a light public workout at Belfast's Victoria Square on Wednesday with Donovan joined in the ring by his cousin Jim who will make his debut on Saturday's undercard.

Crocker opted for some shadow boxing as he reaffirmed his desire to keep his powder dry until fight night, but says he will "relish the moment" when he makes his way to the ring.

"Everything has gone to plan," the undefeated 28-year-old told BBC Sport NI's Thomas Kane.

"It's the biggest night of my life on Saturday, so I'm ready to get it done.

"It's going to be crazy. Even the atmosphere here for the public workouts is exceptional, so I'm planning on a big night on Saturday.

"It means everything to me, a dream come true, so to get the job done for a world title is everything I want in life. [I'll] relish the moment as these things don't come around often."

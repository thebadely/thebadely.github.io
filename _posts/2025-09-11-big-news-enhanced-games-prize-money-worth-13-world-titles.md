It has been recently reported that Ben Proud won a world silver medal in the 50m freestyle earlier this year

Olympic swimmer Ben Proud said it would take "13 years of winning a World Championship title" for athletes to earn the same amount of prize money on offer for winning a single race at the Enhanced Games.

On Wednesday, Proud became the first British athlete to join the controversial event, which allows athletes to take banned performance-enhancing drugs under medical supervision.

The Enhanced Games offers appearance fees, with a $1m bonus on offer for breaking the world record for the 50m freestyle - the event in which Proud has won world and European gold.

At the World Aquatics Championships in 2022, the total prize money for swimming was $2.73m, with athletes receiving $20,000 for finishing first.

"I'm 30 years old and retirement has been a topic of contention for quite a few years," Proud told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"In reality, us athletes in the Olympic programme don't earn enough money to retire off the back of this and I am always seeking something that can see me through a bit longer."

Proud is on Aquatics GB's 'podium' list of their World Class Programme for 2025 which "supports athletes possessing genuine and strong medal potential at the next Olympic Games in LA 2028" and awards them with up to Â£29,000 of investment.

Aquatics GB has said it "condemns Ben's decision in the strongest terms".

Proud said he understands governing bodies' criticism, but argued "traditional sport" and the Enhanced Games are "two very different formats" and he does not expect to return to traditional swimming. 

"It would have taken me 13 years of winning a World Championship title in order to win what I could win in one race at this games," Proud said.

"I love what I do, I love my sport and to continue it a little longer gives me that satisfaction."

The Enhanced Games is planned to be an annual competition, initially comprising short-distance swimming, sprinting and weightlifting, with the inaugural event set to be held in Las Vegas from 21-24 May 2026.

Ben Proud talks about joining the Enhanced Games

The Enhanced Games has been criticised for endangering athletes' health and undermining fair play, with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) describing it as a "dangerous and irresponsible project", external.

Proud, who has previously supported UK Anti-Doping's (Ukad) Clean Sport Week, said he is "not under any obligation to take anything" despite joining the event.

"In order to compete in these games, to be in a position to earn this prize money that you would never see in professional sport, I am forced to retire," he said.

"There are many different doctors and healthcare specialists who will guide and inform me on decisions. If that was to become the case later on [that I would take performance-enhancing drugs], I would be in good hands to make the best informed decision."

Only substances approved by the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can be taken, which is different to the list Wada allows for elite athletes.

Earlier this year, World Aquatics became the first international sport federation to ban athletes, coaches and officials from its events if they have taken part in the Enhanced Games.

"The Enhanced Games is trying to reduce the stigma around some of these substances," Proud added. 

"Some of these things, they have fantastic effects on the body and really limited side effects. Those are the ones to me that are curious - what could you take that makes you feel better, better energy, more recovery, without health risks."

Proud's move to the Enhanced Games was met with a lot of criticism.

In a statement on social media, external, Aquatics GB said it is "immensely disappointed", while UK Sport said it was working with Aquatics GB "as a matter of urgency to determine Ben Proud's suitability to receive public funds".

Meanwhile, Ukad chief executive Jane Rumble said: "It is incredibly disappointing that any British athlete would consider competing in an event that flies in the face of the true spirit of sport."

Proud said he "fully understands" the negative reaction.

"I respect what UK Sport and Aquatics GB have said because if I were in their shoes, I would agree fully," Proud said.

"They need to protect themselves and the sport from this competition so I fully understand the reactions I have received from making this change."

Proud won world gold at 50m freestyle in 2022, and Olympic silver at the 2024 Games in Paris, while he claimed a world silver medal earlier this year.

"I want to hold as much respect to swimming by removing myself as much as I can," he said.

"I don't expect to come back. Being one of the first people to make this move comes with a lot of controversy."

Let's dive into the details: Walsh won bronze at the delayed Tokyo Olympics which were held in 2021

Perceptions sometimes mask reality and that can never be more accurate than in the case of an elite athlete.

For those looking on from the outside, Aidan Walsh seemed to be flying high when claiming Olympic bronze in 2021, but scratch the surface and the affable Belfast man was fighting a different battle.

The pressure of performing at the highest level in amateur boxing has brought some dark days, so announcing his retirement on Monday "hasn't been difficult at all", saying he is "at peace" with the decision.

"I wish I had done it a couple of years ago because it was coming," he confirmed.

The 28-year-old has made no secret of his mental health struggles despite enjoying success between the ropes with that Olympic bronze in Tokyo, while also claiming Commonwealth silver in 2018 and gold in 2022.

Boxing "felt like a conveyor belt I couldn't get off" as success only raised expectations and brought added pressure.

Although producing a superb run of victories to qualify for Paris 2024, he admitted he was struggling to get through the final World Qualifier in Bangkok, just as he did in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.

Exiting the Paris Games in the first round to home favourite Makan Traore, Walsh opened up afterwards about his problems and although his retirement doesn't come as a great surprise, "now is the right time".

"Looking back at the interview in Paris, it brought back a lot of emotions. When you see it from an outside perspective, you see the emotional pain, the stress, the pressure and anxiety.

"Looking back, I was going through a lot so I just feel so grateful to have met good people and without that support, it would have been more difficult.

"I've had a lot of really good help from my family, my girlfriend and her family. I'm at peace with it now because I was putting other people who care for me and love me under pressure due to my own suffering, so it's the right decision for myself and everyone else."

Walsh expressed his gratitude to those who helped him over the years including Sport NI's Gary Longwell, while crediting clinical psychologist Dr Paul Gaffney as the man who "changed my life", saying the relationships, rather than medals, "mean the most to me".

When he and older sister Michaela first stepped through the doors of St Agnes' Boxing Club in Andersonstown with father and coach Damien, little did the siblings know they were embarking on a magical journey that would see them reach two Commonwealth and two Olympic Games together as team-mates.

That bond was not just limited to the ring, but Aidan credits his sister for being instrumental in helping him get through some of his darker days.

"In sport, you're in an environment where you are always chasing success, based on performance, expectations and funding criteria. It's part of high performance sport and athletes know what they are signing up for, so it's hard to appreciate those moments.

"I couldn't have done all of that without Michaela being there, without my family, without Paul Gaffney and the people closest to me.

"The Olympics, really struggling going there; Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, didn't want to go and retired a week before but Michaela lifted me off the floor at Ulster University in the training camp.

"I'll be honest and say I didn't enjoy my career. I wish I could give my Olympic medal to Michaela because she deserves it far more."

Walsh's matador style in the ring was not to everyone's taste but regardless, it helped him join an exclusive club of Irish boxers with an Olympic medal.

The opportunity to upgrade the colour in Tokyo was only denied because in celebrating his quarter-final win over Merven Clair, the Irish boxer injured his ankle and was ruled out of his semi-final against Pat McCormack.

Still, the encouragement to be the best version of himself brought him to that point and it is a philosophy he will carry forward.

"I got a lot of stick over the years about my style with people saying it wouldn't work or be effective, I was running or afraid, so I used strategy over aggression," he reflected.

"The biggest bit of advice I ever got from a coach, before I walked in to fight for an Olympic medal, was 'Aidan, be yourself'. That stands out because a lot of coaches want to tell you what to do, but if you allow an athlete to express themselves, amazing things can happen and I've experienced it."

Walsh is currently studying for a Masters in Sports Psychology at Ulster University and outlined his desire to embark upon a PhD focused on Irish boxing in the future, while writing a book about his experiences is also an ambition.

There are no plans to go down the coaching route, but instead, use his knowledge to help those young amateurs coming behind him with "athlete well-being" his priority.

"I'm in a position now to help others walk the path and make sure they aren't alone as there's nothing more terrifying.

"My goal is to contribute to make sure there's someone within that environment to support them, not how to become a better boxers, win medals or have success, but to make them feel safe.

"It's been hard, tough and fast (career), so I'm just happy it's over and on to the next phase of my life."

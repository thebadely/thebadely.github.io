Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Stockdale was forced off on his 40th appearance for Ireland against Georgia at the weekend

Jacob Stockdale has been ruled out of Ireland's match with Portugal after suffering a shoulder injury in Saturday's win in Georgia.

The Ulster wing was forced off late in the first half of the 34-5 win with his left arm in a makeshift sling using his shirt.

In a squad update issued on Monday, Ireland confirmed that the 29-year-old will be absent for the final game of the summer tour in Portugal on Saturday (19:00 BST) and will see a specialist in Ireland next week.

It is the latest blow for Stockdale in an Ireland jersey, who was forced off with a hamstring injury in his previous international appearance against Fiji in November.

With 16 Ireland players on British and Irish Lions duty, Stockdale was the most experienced international in interim head coach Paul O'Connell's squad.

Cian Prendergast has recovered from illness and will be available for selection after missing the win against Georgia.

Stockdale's Ulster team-mate Scott Wilson has also returned home after the prop was called up as injury cover.

O'Connell has no further injury concerns and will name his team for the game against Portugal on Thursday.

O'Connell loved Ireland's 'hunger and intent'

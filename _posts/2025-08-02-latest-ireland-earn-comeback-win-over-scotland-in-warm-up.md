Watch: Ireland v Scotland highlights

Women's Rugby World Cup warm-up 

Ireland (12) 27

Tries: McGrath, Deely, McGillivray, O'Dowd, Nic a Bhaird Con: O'Brien

Scotland (14) 21

Tries: Thomson, Scott, Orr Cons: Thomson 2, Scott

Ireland recovered from a slow start to beat Scotland and begin their Women's Rugby World Cup preparations in impressive fashion. 

Having lost to Italy last week, Scotland raced into an early 14-0 lead in Cork through Lisa Thomson and Lucia Scott tries. 

But after Scotland lost hooker Lana Skeldon to a serious-looking injury on the half-hour mark, the tide turned in Ireland's favour as Sadhbh McGrath and Meabh Deely crossed to leave just two points between the sides at half-time. 

Ireland were dominant for long spells in the second half and scored their third when debutant Nancy McGillivray touched down. 

Scotland hit back thanks to a fine solo effort from Emma Orr, but Ireland rallied in the closing stages through Niamh O'Dowd and Deirbhile Nic a Bhaird. 

Having avenged their Women's Six Nations defeat by the Scots earlier this year, Ireland will look to maintain their pre-World Cup momentum when they host Canada in Belfast on 9 August (12:00 BST).

Scotland, meanwhile, must regroup in time for their tournament opener against Wales at Salford Community Stadium on 23 August. 

Lana Skeldon received treatment on the field before being taken off on a stretcher

Scotland's World Cup preparations have been anything but smooth. Last month, captain Rachel Malcolm said her side had been put in an "unfair position" by a "very disruptive" build-up to the tournament with more than half the squad facing uncertainty over their contracts. 

Additionally, head coach Bryan Easson last month announced he will step down after the World Cup, which Malcolm described as "a shock" and "upsetting". 

And while morale was further hit by last week's 34-29 loss to Italy in Parma, Scotland did not seem to be bearing the weight of off-field issues as they raced into an early lead against an Ireland that initially struggled to assert themselves without injured forwards Dorothy Wall, Erin King and Aoife Wafer.

Thomson struck first before Scott burst clear after a slick pass from scrum-half Caity Mattinson.

However, Scotland's momentum was disrupted by Skeldon's injury. The 81-cap Bristol forward was hurt while attempting to tackle Ireland prop Siobhan McCarthy, and received treatment on the field for eight minutes before being taken off. 

Following Skeldon's departure, Ireland pegged the visitors back with quickfire scores from McGrath and Deely.

After the break, Ireland - who welcomed back captain Sam Monaghan and wing Beibhinn Parsons from long-term injuries - took the lead for the first time when McGillivray marked her first Test appearance in style after a period of sustained pressure.

But despite Scotland's replacement back Coreen Grant's yellow card, the visitors hit back when Orr weaved through a sea of green shirts to score a superb individual try.

That sparked another impressive Irish response, however, as O'Dowd and Nic a Bhaird struck to give Scott Bemand's side a six-point win and a platform to build from as they gear up for their Pool C opener against Japan on 24 August.

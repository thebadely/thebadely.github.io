Here’s what you need to know: A bottled water sold at Waitrose could contain glass and should be returned to the store, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.

The 750ml No1 Royal Deeside Mineral Water and the sparkling variety are being recalled "because of the possible presence of glass fragments upon opening the bottles," which the FSA said "may cause injury and makes it unsafe to drink".

Waitrose apologised and said it was recalling "some" bottles as a precaution.

The supermarket is asking customers not to use the bottles and to take them back to Waitrose or contact the company for a full refund.

"If you have bought any of the above products do not drink it," the FSA said in its recall notice.

It added that the supermarket would be putting up notices in its shops warning customers.

Deeside water is produced in Scotland from natural springs in the Cairngorms national park. 

The firm produces special batches for Waitrose, which are affected by the recall. Each bottle costs around £1.60p at Waitrose stores.

It is not clear exactly how many bottles have been sold and what proportion of bottles are affected.

The batch codes for the recalled mineral water are: NOV 2027 28, DEC 2027 01, DEC 2027 02, DEC 2027 10, DEC 2027 11 and DEC 2027 16, with best before dates of November and December 2027.

The batch codes for the recalled sparkling water are: DEC 2027 01, DEC 2027 03, DEC 2027 12, DEC 2027 15 and DEC 2027 25, with a best before date of December 2027.

The FSA advised people contact Waitrose Customer Care on 0800 188 884, choosing option 4.

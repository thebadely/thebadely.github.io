According to new developments, Several papers lead on the Metropolitan Police looking into claims Prince Andrew allegedly used his police protection to try to obtain personal information about Virginia Giuffre. "Andy sweats over police probe" is the Sun's headline. The Daily Telegraph says Prince Andrew faces becoming the first member of the Royal Family to be investigated by police in more than 20 years. The Daily Mirror calls it the "scandal with no end". Prince Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

The front page of the Guardian says parliament is under mounting pressure to introduce a mechanism to formally strip Prince Andrew of his titles, given the ongoing revelations. The i Paper reports the government will be "guided" by the Royal Family when it comes to forming a decision.

Some of the papers offer suggestions on what the Royal Family should do next. The Daily Mail says the King should "cut the cord" and have Prince Andrew "evicted". The Daily Mirror says he should go into voluntary exile. The Daily Star has a similar proposal: that he should be "banished" from public life or sent to the Tower of London.

The Financial Times reports Friday's meeting between Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House descended into a "shouting match". The FT's sources claim the US president repeated arguments used by Russia and was "cursing all the time".

According to the Times, Reform UK is investigating whether it underpaid value-added tax (VAT) after experts said the party might have broken the law and could face a fine. Political parties are required to pay VAT on certain types of income over the value of Â£90,000 a year. The Times' sources believe the threshold was exceeded due to ticket sales from Reform's party conference.

The Daily Star is celebrating after its video of the lettuce which outlasted Liz Truss's time as prime minister in 2022 joined the British Film Institute's National Archive. The BFI called the livestream a "seminal moment in British political history" that should be "preserved for future generations".

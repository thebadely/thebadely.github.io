Let's dive into the details: Farmers say they feel abandoned as thousands of long-running nature scheme payments are set to end.

According to a Freedom of Information request by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), 5,830 Countryside Stewardship (CS) agreements will stop in December.

These provide financial incentives to put in place measures like insecticide-free farming, wildflower strips and flourishing hedgerows. Gloucestershire arable and livestock farmer David Barton said he felt "completely abandoned" by the move.

Defra said it was working with farmers to build a more profitable farming system by focusing on food production "in an uncertain world".

Mr Barton, 58, said: "This came out of the blue and with no clear direction. I think it's absolutely woeful of any government to not have that direction."

Many of the stewardships are being phased out as part of a transition towards post-Brexit environmental land management schemes, such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI).

In March, the UK government caused upset farmers when it closed applications to the SFI because it was allocated for the year.

Mr Barton, from Cirencester, said his farm received small amounts from SFI and he was preparing to transfer his "comprehensive" CS scheme to the new system for January.

Since applications have closed, he has "no idea" what will happen after 31 December.

"Never before has one scheme run out before another one was up and running," said Mr Barton. 

His environmental projects are expensive, require forward planning, and could unravel quickly without support, leaving "significant" environmental damage, he warned.

Warwickshire arable farmer Mark Meadows, 53, will also see his scheme term end on December 31.

He said: "We've been hit with the double whammy this year that we've got poor yields and the prices just keep falling.

"To top it all off, we don't know what's going to happen with our environmental land."

The NFU wants Defra to let existing Countryside Stewardship agreements continue for a year while a long-term plan is developed.

NFU deputy president David Exwoodsaid he had written to farming minister Daniel Zeichner to highlight farmers' concerns. 

"Defra must provide a clear plan for their future, and urgently," he said.

A Defra spokesperson said it was still making investment in nature-friendly farming.

They added: "We are aware there are some agreements ending in the months ahead and considering how best to deliver for the environment, the public and farmers."

Let's dive into the details: Salford Red Devils have won one of their past 16 Super League matches

Salford's Super League game against Wakefield on Sunday has been called off because of "significant" welfare concerns after discussions with the Rugby Football League.

The troubled Red Devils have "reluctantly" decided to cancel the match after being beaten 80-6 at Hull FC in a game where five players made their debuts for the club.

With most of the team's senior professionals leaving this season because of their financial issues, Salford have had to rely on loanees from other Super League teams.

A club statement, external said that of the 17 players available for Sunday's game, only two had appeared at Super League level in the past 12 months.

The RFL board, in line with its operational rules, will now decide on the outcome of the fixture next week.

Last month when Warrington Wolves forfeited their Women's Super League match against St Helens citing player availability issues, Saints were awarded a 48-0 win.

Salford are bottom of the top flight with 19 defeats from their 21 matches this season.

Their owners released a statement on Monday to say the club would not be closing despite their money problems.

Chief operating officer Claire Bradbury resigned from her position on Thursday and alleged the club's ownership suggested she "sleep with someone at the Rugby Football League" to ease their situation. Salford said they will be "conducting a thorough internal investigation".

With five games now remaining this season, the club said they have 11 players unavailable through injury but "a number" are expected to be fit for their next fixture against Leigh, scheduled for Friday, 22 August.

The RFL added that discussions would continue with Salford about their scheduled fixtures for the rest of the Super League campaign.

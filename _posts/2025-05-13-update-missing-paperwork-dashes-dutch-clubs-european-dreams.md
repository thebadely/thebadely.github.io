Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Fortuna Sittard have only qualified for European football on two previous occasions

Dutch club Fortuna Sittard's dreams of playing European football next season have been dashed because of missing paperwork.

Fortuna sit ninth in the Eredevisie with two games left - a position that would earn them a play-off place for a spot in the Uefa Conference League.

However, the club do not have the required Uefa licence after failing to apply before the 8 April deadline, and therefore would be ineligible to participate in European competition next term.

"At that time, the club did not meet all the requirements, including the submission of an external auditor's report in accordance with Uefa rules," the club said.

"This ruled out participation in the play-offs for European football in advance."

Fortuna have not played in Europe since the 1998 Intertoto Cup - a tournament that offered backdoor entry to the Uefa Cup.

"It is disappointing that we cannot reward a great sporting season," Fortuna general manager Martijn Merks said. 

"However, we think it is important to be transparent. We are currently busy preparing for the new Eredivisie season and in the meantime we are continuing to build on the future sustainability of the club. 

"We expect to be able to meet the licensing requirements in the new season without any problems."

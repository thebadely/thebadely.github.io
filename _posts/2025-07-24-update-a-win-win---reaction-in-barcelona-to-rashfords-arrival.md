Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Marcus Rashford will wear the number 14 in Barcelona

Marcus Rashford's move from Manchester United to Barcelona has provoked huge interest, with fans and media across the UK fascinated to see whether the forward can reignite a stalled career that once looked so promising.

And there's a similar level of intrigue on the shores of the Mediterranean, with Barca fans anxious to see what kind of player is arriving in the Catalan capital.

To gauge the mood, BBC Sport has spoken to three Barcelona-based journalists and asked for their views on the England international's arrival.

Here are the thoughts of Jamie Easton Gombau (La Liga TV presenter), Jordi Pons (Spanish TV commentator) and Toni Padilla (journalist for local newspaper Ara).

Barca's forward line is already well stocked, with veteran marksman Robert Lewandowski, teen sensation Lamine Yamal and rejuvenated Raphinha all coming off brilliant seasons, while further depth comes from Spain internationals Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres. So where does Rashford fit in?

Jamie Easton Gombau: We know from Deco, Barca's sporting director, that they wanted another winger - partly to rest Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, and also to play Raphinha in a different role as a number 10. But Rashford is a joker in the pack because he can also fit as a false nine or striker, which will be even more important this season to give some rest to Lewandowski, considering his age. 

Luis Diaz and Nico Williams were the first choices, so Rashford was option C... at least! He's also the cheapest option which is important because Barca's financial situation is a long way from being solved.

Toni Padilla: Barca wanted someone who can play mostly on the left side, but also as a striker. Barca's first idea was to have a younger player, like Williams, but Rashford is still young enough. From a tactical point of view, considering Rashford's evolution in the last few years, it fits perfectly. But we should remember he's only here because Nico said no.

Jordi Pons: Manager Hansi Flick is looking for more alternatives, so he can have competition for places in every position. Above all, he wants to be able to give rest to Raphinha, who started nearly every game across every competition last season. Flick wants to raise the level of the squad.

Rashford's career has been a mixed bag, with great early promise fading dramatically in more recent times. Do those in Barcelona regard him as good enough to make a meaningful impression for his new team?

Jamie Easton Gombau: Well, it depends on which Marcus Rashford we see. A few years ago, he was quite something - one of the best players in the Premier League. But if he gives the same level of performance that we saw last season for Aston Villa, that won't be good enough for Barcelona. 

We need to understand one thing: Barca have effectively swapped Ansu Fati for Rashford, and Fati isn't the player we saw a few years ago. So I think it's a win-win for Barca and for Rashford... and maybe also for Manchester United, because if he scores and assists in double figures, his market value will go up.

Toni Padilla: It will be hard for him to start a lot of games, because Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Lewandowski are already there. Torres and Olmo won't be too happy that Rashford is in town because now they have more competition, but Flick has asked to have a deep squad so Rashford will have opportunities. It's on him: he needs to prove that he deserves to play in the big games.

Jordi Pons: I remember when Rashford was young and promised so much. He beat defenders, ran up and down the wing, and above all I liked his shot from mid-range. 

Sometimes players can lose their way, but I see someone who is willing to drop his salary and try to re-establish himself in a team like Barca. A few years ago, everyone was talking about how great he was, and what a huge career he was going to have. Now he's got a big opportunity ahead of him to return to that world-class level.

Gary Lineker spent three seasons at Barcelona

Rashford becomes the first Englishman to represent Barcelona since Gary Lineker left in 1989, and he will look to emulate the success of his predecessor who scored 52 goals in 138 appearances. But does his nationality matter to Barca followers?

Jamie Easton Gombau: It was about time! It's shocking to me that for a country producing so much talent, so few English players have been coming to La Liga. I think there's a belief around Spain that British players struggle to adapt to the country and the culture, but Jude Bellingham changed that in his astonishing first season for Real Madrid. 

Spain and England might be the strongest two footballing countries in the world, so there should be a greater exchange of players and coaches. Before Bellingham it was just one-way from Spain to the UK, but maybe now there will be a change in that tendency.

Toni Padilla: I think most Barca fans will be happy. It's global football now, so you get used to having new players from all over the world arriving every season. It will be a bit strange to see a British player with Barca so that will create hype, but I think people are happy about it.

Jordi Pons: I can still remember being at Camp Nou and singing 'Go Gary Gary, Gary Gary Gary Gary Lin-e-ker!' I was a student at the time, and Lineker was greatly loved by Barca fans. I think most Barca fans appreciate English football because of the atmosphere, the songs of the fans, and being English could help Rashford. 

A lot of Barca fans will say 'come on, it's been a long time since we had an English player, let's see what this guy is like'.

Over the past few years, Rashford has made more headlines off the pitch than for his exploits on the field. Will his strong personality and ability to capture media headlines be tolerated in the Catalan capital?

Jamie Easton Gombau: People say he arrives with baggage, but what's that baggage? That he became a social activist? Is that a bad thing? I don't think it will be a problem. He just wants to play again and feel important, and he believes Barcelona is the right club for that. 

I understand that maybe Rashford has been distracted from football, but remember what happened with Antony: he came from the same club, and it was seen as a very big risk, but he was one of the best players in La Liga for Real Betis in the second half of last season. I don't think there's a major concern.

Toni Padilla: Let's see. Right now in Barcelona we're talking more about the private life of Lamine Yamal after his famous 18th birthday party! That hadn't happened before for such a young player, so it has taken us to a new dimension.

Jordi Pons: I look at what players do on the pitch. After that, if they want to do whatever they feel they have to do, I don't think it matters. I don't think it will be a problem.

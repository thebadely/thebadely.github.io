Experts revealed that A chain of bakery and coffee shops is closing 12 of its 14 branches due to a rise in operating costs and "changes in customer spending habits".

Butterwick was founded by couple Fiona and Ryan Scarborough in Corby, Northamptonshire.

In a Facebook post, they said only their stores at Rushden Lakes retail park and St Giles' Street in Northampton would remain open, and the others would close "with immediate effect".

The couple said they were "heartbroken for the impact on our incredible team members". 

Butterwick had branches across Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, as well as in Milton Keynes, Rugby in Warwickshire and Retford in Nottinghamshire.

The owners said: "It is with deep regret that we announce the closure of all Butterwick stores with immediate effect, apart from our Rushden Lakes and Northampton St Giles' locations.

"This decision has not been made lightly. 

"Despite tireless efforts to secure all stores and protect every role, the continued rise in operating costs and significant changes in customer spending habits have left us unable to sustain the business in its current form."

The couple added: "This is not the end of Butterwick - it's the beginning of an exciting new chapter. By focusing on Rushden and Northampton, we will be returning to our roots: an authentic in-store bakery experience where craft, freshness, and creativity come first."

They said all current orders for celebration or wedding cakes would be honoured.

Here’s what you need to know: Igor Jesus joined Nottingham Forest in the summer from Botafogo for a reported Â£10m

Igor Jesus' anime-inspired celebration is becoming a familiar sight in Europe.

A fan of Dragon Ball Z since childhood, Nottingham Forest's Brazilian forward celebrates his goals by mimicking the powerful energy blast used by the character Goku in the Japanese adventure series.

He got to show it off after just 82 seconds on the pitch in Forest's Europa League game at Utrecht on Thursday, as the substitute's late goal sealed a 2-1 win.

That was his fourth goal in Europe for Forest and seventh in all competitions, and the 24-year-old is determined to keep his impressive run going.

"It was very nice to score after one minute in the game," Igor Jesus told BBC Radio Nottingham afterwards. 

"When I was [on the bench] I was just thinking of the game and when the coach puts me in the game I give my best.

"I want to continue like this."

Igor Jesus joined Forest in the summer from Brazilian side Botafogo.

His career started five years ago at Coritiba, a then Serie-B side based in Brazil's eighth largest city.

As an 18-year-old he scored three goals in 24 appearances to help them secure promotion.

But, after initially struggling at a higher level, he left midway through the following campaign to join Emirati side Shabab Al-Ahli.

He spent four seasons in the Middle East, scoring 46 goals in 92 games, before returning to Brazil and Botafogo in July 2024.

There he has excelled. He led the line as his side lifted the Serie A and Copa Libertadores titles last season.

Unsurprisingly, the scouting departments at numerous club around the world were on high alert.

Igor Jesus made his Brazil debut in October last year, scoring in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying win in difficult conditions in Chile.

South American football expert Tim Vickery called him "the modern-day Drogba" after he scored the winner against European champions Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup group stage during the summer.

Igor Jesus' goal had another significance in that it finally ended a long wait for many Forest fans.

When their supporters celebrated a win at Auxerre in the Uefa Cup back in 1995, many perhaps will not have expected it to take three decades before they would have similar scenes away from home in Europe.

The victory means they are firmly in contention for a top-eight finish in the league phase of the Europa League, which would secure automatic qualification for the knockouts.

"I am delighted for the fans. Fantastic," Forest boss Sean Dyche said.

"Very pleased with the players so far, because we are mixing and very pleased with the results.

"Long may it continue."

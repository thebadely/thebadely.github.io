Netherlands win opening Euro 2025 match against Wales

Wales' most-capped player Jess Fishlock says her side "will figure it out," after suffering a 3-0 defeat to the Netherlands in their first major tournament match.

Wales are the lowest ranked side at Euro 2025 and contained the 2017 winners the Netherlands until the final minute of first half stoppage time when Vivianne Miedema curled home a brilliant opener, her 100th international goal.

Rhian Wilkinson's side conceded against moments after the restart and were 3-0 behind on 57 minutes, with the Netherlands hitting the woodwork three times and forcing goalkeeper Olivia Clark to make several saves.

Despite a chastening first match at a major finals, Wales' key performer and top goalscorer Fishlock is confident they can improve ahead of equally daunting contests against France and England.

"It was tough tonight. To concede just before half-time and then so quickly after half-time, it is probably lapses of concentration and at this level, you switch off and you get punished," Fishlock said.

"We are probably going to be a little bit disappointed in ourselves that we didn't get in and regroup the way we normally do. But this is this level and we have to get used to this really fast."

The Seattle Reign midfielder, 38, says Wales will need to show a big improvement ahead of their next match against France on Wednesday, 9 July.

"What I do know is that we are going to regroup and get better as this tournament goes on," Fishlock said.

"I think we have learned we can't switch off and we have to be better on the ball. At this level you have to keep the ball and move the ball and create space. We'll figure it out.

"It is hard because we lost. I hate losing. But it is great to be here. All of our fans are fantastic."

Wales boss Rhian Wilkinson says her side must learn lessons from their opening defeat.

"I mean, like the very first question we get at the draw is what a group, right? And we have a hard group, there's no getting away from that," she said.

"To concede a goal right before half is always painful.

"We have to create more opportunities and we have to make sure that those moments of lapses get fewer and fewer. But this is the world stage. 

"This is the big event and, you know, it's intimidating. It's the first game, but equally this is what we want."

Wilkinson is confident her players will improve against France in St Gallen on Wednesday night.

"Getting into the half at 0-0 would have gone a long way. In the second half, that quick goal definitely hurt us," she added.

"We have a huge, huge mountain in front of us in this tournament and we're excited about that. We want to play at the world stage and to be courageous in doing that."

Wilkinson says she was "emotional," seeing the Welsh fans, with almost 4,000 making the trip to Lucerne and knows this is a chance to showcase the country.

"We're here now and forever Wales women have made it to a major tournament. These women will turn this around. I'm not worried about that," she added.

"It's disappointing to lose 3-0, but it's not calamitous. It is a new opportunity for us to go towards the next which will be another huge test.

"I don't want to be disrespectful, but many people don't know where Wales is on a map. And that's what we get to show people now."

Wales captain Angharad James admitted her side were not at their best.

"We looked a bit sluggish and didn't play the game we know we can but we knew it could go that way," she told Match of the Day Wales.

"We've waited a very long time to have this special occasion. Our fans were incredible, we could not ask for any more from them.

"I hope we did them and everyone at home proud but we know we've got a lot to improve on.

"Captaining Wales at a major tournament was a moment I will never forget. It was such a proud moment. I can't quite believe little Wales is here on this world stage.

"I'm so proud of everyone. We've got two more games and we'll give it our all."

Experts revealed that David Moyes returned for his second stint as Everton manager on 11 January

Everton manager David Moyes says the club are "running out" of time to make the impact they were hoping for in the summer transfer window.

Moyes said his club have money to spend but the deals they were hoping to complete have not materialised.

Club sources have distanced themselves from a potential move for Manchester City's unwanted England midfielder Jack Grealish, while an attempt to lure Kenny Tete north from Fulham floundered when the Dutchman opted to sign a new deal at Craven Cottage.

Everton continue to be linked with numerous players and have signed young left-back Adam Aznou from Bayern Munich.

But Moyes said he could offer no guarantees Aznou, 19, would be propelled immediately into the senior starting line-up and said bringing experienced players to Everton this summer was proving troublesome.

"The truth is we're not getting a lot of the deals over the line at the moment, that's a fact," he said to reporters in Chicago before his side's Premier League Summer Series encounter with former club West Ham.

"We're desperate to get things moving on because we know time's running out."

By this weekend, it will be nine weeks since Everton ended their season by beating Newcastle at St James' Park to seal a 13th-placed Premier League finish, their best performance since 2021.

With ambitious new owners and a summer move to their magnificent new stadium, it felt as though a reboot of a once mighty club was on the cards.

It has not turned out the way Moyes imagined.

Four new players, including Aznou and reserve keeper Mark Travers, does not cover for the loss of five experienced regular starters including Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Abdoulaye Doucoure.

Everton drew with League Two Accrington and lost at Championship side Blackburn before heading to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series.

After Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth, Moyes, 62, said he needed six more players.

"The one thing I'll do is I'll tell the fans straight, and I'm telling it straight at the moment, we're having a bit of a struggle getting ones in quickly," said Moyes.

"My first thought is yes, I'm surprised, because I think Everton's such a big club, with great traditions and the new stadium's an exciting move for us.

"But when you think again about it, we've been in or around the relegation positions for the last five years, not far off the bottom, so maybe there's been reasons for it."

According to new developments, Rugby union legend Jonny Wilkinson has visited Surrey as part of a campaign to help people improve their mental health.

His visit to the University of Surrey's sports ground in Guildford is part of Mental Health Awareness Week, which begins on Monday.

After retiring from Rugby in 2014, Wilkinson spoke about the problems of adjusting to life without playing, and in 2023 discussed how he suffered self-doubt during his career. 

Wilkinson's last-minute drop-goal against Australia won England the World Cup in 2003.

Mr Wilkinson now talks and campaigns extensively on mental health issues, and as part of that is working with Milk & More, a Surrey milk delivery service.

Together they are working to popularise a set of daily wellbeing routines, which the company's milk deliverers will be passing on to their customers.

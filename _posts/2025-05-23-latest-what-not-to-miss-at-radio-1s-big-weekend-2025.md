According to new developments, Radio 1's Big Weekend is about to get going in Sefton Park, Liverpool.

Each year the station rounds up some of the hottest artists in the world and gets them together for three days of music in a UK city.

But with about 100 acts across four stages, there's a lot to take in.

So BBC Newsbeat spoke to DJs Greg James, Sian Eleri and Jack Saunders to get their top tips on what to watch out for.

Radio 1 Breakfast host Greg James says Sam Fender's main stage headline slot on Saturday will be "incredibly significant". 

"He's an artist that Radio 1 has supported from day one," says Greg.

"We all knew that something special could happen with him, and it has."

Official UK Chart Show host Jack says the weekend is a chance for him to watch artists he's interviewed performing.

"Joy Crookes is an artist who I've never seen live before who I love to hang out with on the radio," he says.

"She's so much fun. Her music is so soulful, so euphoric and she is just a great time and I think her set's going to be a great time."

Future Artists host Sian says dance act Barry Can't Swim is her big tip.

The Scottish DJ, real name Joshua Spence Mainnie, was nominated for last year's Mercury Music Prize and a host of other awards for his debut, When Do We Land?.

"I've been lucky enough to see him live a couple of times now and every single time he delivers," she says. 

"It's the best gig of your life. It's colourful. It's vibrant. The vibes are there," says Sian, who's also hoping to hear "secret unreleased bits" from Barry's upcoming album.

"The whole point of Big Weekend is that we have big headliners," says Greg. 

"But we also have the New Music Stage and then we have the Introducing stage, which finds the next Sam Fender.

"I think that Big Weekend tends to do that.

"We put artists on the radio and back them from the early days... you can chart their progress."

Greg says it's well worth paying attention to lesser-known artists before they become the next big thing. 

And one of those Sian is backing is "phenomenal" singer-songwriter Sienna Spiro, who plays the BBC Introducing stage on Saturday.

"She's one of those vocalists who stops you in your tracks," says Sian.

"Imagine if I'd discovered Adele, for example, all those years ago, I would feel the same way as I do about Sienna Spiro. 

"She is definitely one of those artists who's going to skyrocket, so be an early fan now."

Jack's shout is ex-Little Mix member Jade, who's topping the New Music stage bill on Sunday.

 "She's obviously been at the top of many bills with Little Mix, but in her own right as a solo artist is a completely different proposition," says Jack.

"We have only seen her do it at the Brit Awards so far, so Big Weekend will be a big moment for her."

Like any festival, Big Weekend is all about those moments that you'll remember for years to come.

Greg recalls Charli XCX's performance last year, in Luton, on the New Music Stage, "just before Brat summer took hold of the world".

"It felt like something was really bubbling under the surface with her," he says.

"And we got it just before it went mad."

Sian's memory is a little more personal.

"My first Big Weekend, 2010, in Bangor, when I went as a punter," she says.

"I was a huge Vampire Weekend fan at the time... I was front and centre, leaning up against the barriers, having the time of my life. 

"I've still got rubbish pictures on a digital camera that I took with me at the time. 

"I'll never forget that moment," she says. "I was losing my mind."

If you're actually heading down to Sefton Park, the weather forecast is looking... mixed.

Saturday, in particular, is threatening to be soggy, with showers predicted for most of the day.

But Sian's staying optimistic.

"I don't want to jinx it, but it has been sunny every single year," she says. 

"So bring sun cream, bring hats." 

Some wellies might be a good shout, too.

"Look after yourself. Keep an eye on each other. Get some water going. Just be sensible and have a good time," says Sian.

If you're looking to make the most of the music, the Radio 1 crew have some tips.

"Look at the clash finder," says Jack, referring to the tool that tells you whether two artists you want to see are playing at the same time.

"Work out which artists you want to see the most, and which you would be OK with missing," he says.

"And don't leave it until you get to the festival."

Greg says you shouldn't be too strict with your schedule, though.

"Go and see some stuff you've never heard of because those people will become the next big things," he says.

"And then you can go: 'Yeah, but I saw them five years ago in Sefton Park on a tiny stage'.

"So go and be there, the handful of people in the crowd for a new band or a new artist. That's quite a cool thing." 

"But don't overplan. Have a couple of headliners to go to. But then just get lost."

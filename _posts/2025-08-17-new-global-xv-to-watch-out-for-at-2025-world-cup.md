England's star-studded squad are favourites to lift the Women's Rugby World Cup trophy in September.

Ireland, Wales and Scotland also have top talent looking to shine at the tournament which will see games played at eight venues across England.

But outside the home nations, who should you watch out for?

Here is BBC Sport's global XV to keep an eye on.

The United States front-row forward has been a standout performer for Exeter Chiefs in the Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR), winning a place in the league's team of the year for the past two seasons.

The 32-year-old, who scored a hat-tick against Australia in May, recently became the Eagles' most-capped women's player and is set to play in a fourth World Cup.

Rogers has been capped 55 times by the United States

The 23-year-old only made her Test debut in May against Fiji but has gone on to start four of Australia's past five Tests, bagging a try in a defeat by Wales.

Two of those starts came against World Cup contenders New Zealand and Canada to mark an incredible rise for the dynamic Amosa, who only made her debut in Super Rugby - featuring four teams from Australia and one from Fiji - last year.

Her brother, Brandon Paenga-Amosa, is also a hooker and came off the bench in the Wallabies' third Test win over the British and Irish Lions. 

The 30-year-old is another one of Exeter's destructive props, having joined the side in 2021.

Menin is a key player for World Cup-chasing Canada and was the player of the match in a victory over world champions New Zealand last year.

Described as "a terrifying prospect" in the loose, Menin powered over in the Pacific Four Series' 27-27 draw against the Black Ferns in May.

The all-action lock made four breakdown turnovers and stole two line-outs during this year's Women's Six Nations.

The 25-year-old, who is the France co-captain, also made the second-most offloads (eight).

Feleu missed out on the player of the tournament to Ireland's Aoife Wafer but will be central to her side's World Cup prospects.

The 30-year-old played at the last World Cup for Australia and has captained the side previously.

England face the Wallaroos on 6 September and Leonard will be aiming to disrupt the Red Roses' formidable line-out.

Three line-out steals against Canada in this year's Pacific Four Series indicates she has the capacity to do so.

Leonard (carrying the ball) has previously played in England with Exeter Chiefs

The 26-year-old captained Canada to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2022 and is one of the stars of the PWR.

The Saracens back rower, known for her barnstorming carries, returned to action last month after recovering from the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury she suffered in June 2024.

De Goede, who is unique as goal-kicking forward, missed out on her Olympic dream last summer and will want to remind everyone why she is one of the best players in the world.

De Goede was nominated for World Rugby women's player of the year in 2024

Tukuafu co-captained New Zealand to World Cup glory over England in 2022 and will be aiming to again lift the trophy.

A typical open-side flanker who is sharp over the ball, the 28-year-old also enjoys carrying hard in the wider channels.

Having missed out on a starting spot in the last final, Tukuafu comes into this World Cup fully fit and an established starter.

Hele has gone from strength-to-strength following her selection for the World Cup in 2022 after only five caps.

Despite her side losing all three games three years ago, the 30-year-old caught the eye of Harlequins, who signed the big ball carrier in 2023.

PWR rugby certainly helped as she was at her dominant best in a World Cup warm-up win over a Black Ferns XV, skittling defenders off , externalfor fun.

Arguably the best scrum-half in the world, Bourdon Sansus continues to produce magical moments.

A long-range drop-goal was part of an exceptional all-round player-of-the-match performance against Scotland in this year's Six Nations.

Full of unpredictability, the 29-year-old has an excellent kicking game and can produce a moment of brilliance to unlock a defence.

The fly-half co-captained the Black Ferns to the World Cup title in 2022, before winning World Rugby women's player of the year.

The 30-year-old has experience on the biggest stage and produced a player-of-the-match performance in that final win over England in 2022.

Demant was at her silky best to help guide the Blues to this year's Super Rugby title in New Zealand and that was followed by helping the Black Ferns regain the Pacific Four Series.

Demant was first named captain of New Zealand for the Pacific Four Series in 2022 

A wonderful individual score against England in this year's Six Nations showed the 20-year-old can perform against the world's best.

It is not just her rapid pace and finishing ability that is a threat, Arbey has a wonderful offloading game, with a speculator one-handed effort setting up a try for Seraphine Okemba against Scotland.

The French flyer is one of the youngest players in their World Cup squad but has taken to international rugby with ease.

Another one of Exeter's foreign imports, Tessier is comfortable at both fly-half and inside centre.

The 2024 World Rugby women's player of the year nominee will captain Canada at the tournament, which shows her value in a squad that contains former skipper De Goede.

Tessier showed her dangerous running game with a try against England at last year's WXV1 tournament.

Ilona Maher has more than eight million followers on social media, the most of any rugby union player in the world.

The 29-year-old spent three months at Bristol Bears earlier this year, scoring four tries in a successful stint as attendances skyrocketed in the PWR. 

A first USA XVs cap since 2021 followed against New Zealand in May, with Maher using her powerful frame from outside centre.

Given the tournament opener is between the United States and hosts England, the stage does not get much bigger to shine.

Considered the greatest in the history of women's rugby, Woodman-Wickliffe has scored a record 20 World Cup tries and helped New Zealand become world champions in 2017 and 2022.

In April, the 34-year-old opted to come out of international retirement after stepping away following last summer's Olympics.

Can she still do it? A sensational seven tries against the United States in May showed her knack of scoring from the wing remains.

The full-back scored Spain's only try in a 97-7 World Cup warm-up hammering by England.

However, the 20-year-old was a bright spark in the game and scored eight tries in an impressive debut season for Harlequins.

Spain, ranked 13th in the world, face two difficult opening games against New Zealand and Ireland, but Pena's sharp acceleration and ability to stay strong in contact will make her a handful against the very best.

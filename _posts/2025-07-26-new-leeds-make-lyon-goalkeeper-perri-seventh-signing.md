According to new developments, Perri kept 13 clean sheets for Lyon last season

Goalkeeper Lucas Perri said it was a "dream come true" to join Leeds United after becoming the club's seventh summer signing.

The 27-year-old Brazilian has joined from French side Lyon in a deal worth a reported Â£15.6m and has agreed a four-year contract at Elland Road.

He played 45 matches across all competitions for Lyon last season, keeping 13 clean sheets as the side qualified for European football by finishing sixth in Ligue 1.

"It is incredible. It is a dream come true," said the 6ft 5in keeper.

"When I first heard that the interest could get something serious and actually happen, I started to look for videos of the stadium, the atmosphere, the games, the highlights of the plays and the matches.

"It was a really exciting moment for me. I was really, really glad that the club showed interest. It was incredible. To sign here I am very, very happy."

Perri began his career at Sao Paulo before moving to Botafogo and then to Lyon.

He has been capped at under-20 and under-23 level for his country.

Frenchman Illan Meslier was Leeds' number one for most of last season as they won the Championship title, but lost his place to Karl Darlow with seven games remaining following a series of errors.

Leeds' other summer signings include midfielder Sean Longstaff from Newcastle, left-back Gabriel Gudmundsson from Lille, centre-back Jaka Bijol from Udinese, and centre-back Sebastiaan Bornauw and forward Lukas Nmecha, both from Wolfsburg.

Scorecard. Table

Trent Rockets steadied themselves to secure a four-wicket victory over Southern Brave in the men's Hundred after batter Adam Hose earlier suffered a serious ankle injury.

Hose was taken to hospital after dislocating his right ankle in the field - an incident that resulted in the match being paused for 10 minutes - during Brave's 140-4.

A batter down in Hose's absence, the Rockets then slipped to 60-4 in their chase with Joe Root out for six.

But Tom Moores came in and hit a thrilling 55 from 30 balls while opener Tom Banton made 49 from 38 as they combined in a crucial stand of 76.

Left-hander Moores was playing his first match in this year's tournament, having been drafted in from outside of Rockets' squad after injuries to their two wicketkeepers, Banton and Tom Alsop, which prevented them taking the gloves.

With fast hands, Moores targeted the leg side and thrashed five sixes and four fours before being caught at mid-off with five runs needed from 11 balls.

Banton nicked Tymal Mills behind next ball but, on his birthday, Marcus Stoinis powered a six to seal the win with four balls to spare.

The win moves Rockets level on points with leaders Northern Superchargers while Brave drop to fourth.

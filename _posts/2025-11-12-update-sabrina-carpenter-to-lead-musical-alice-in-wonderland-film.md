Here’s what you need to know: Sabrina Carpenter looks set to swap her signature Espresso for tea - with the Mad Hatter. 

The US pop star is going back to her acting roots with plans to star in and produce a musical movie inspired by Alice in Wonderland, BBC Newsbeat understands. 

The unnamed project is being made for Universal Pictures and will be written and directed by US filmmaker Lorene Scafaria.

It's not clear who Carpenter will play in the adaptation or when it will go into production.

If it goes ahead, it will be Carpenter's first time leading a major studio film.

The 26-year-old singer approached Universal last year with ideas for it, according to US media outlets. 

As the wonderland became more of a reality, Scafaria reportedly decided to join the madness.

Writer and director Scafaria is best known for her work on Hustlers, a 2019 film fronted by Jennifer Lopez about a crew of strippers in New York City. 

Carpenter has recently been nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the coveted album of the year prize for her seventh album, Man's Best Friend. 

She is currently on the last leg of her Short n' Sweet Tour, which included two headline shows at London's BST Festival this summer. 

The upcoming film will not be the first time she's gone down the rabbit hole of acting. 

Carpenter started out as a child actor on Disney Channel playing a recurring role as Maya Hart on the comedy series Girl Meets World.

Since then, she's appeared in Netflix films Work It and Tall Girl, as well as 20th Century Fox's The Hate U Give.

More recently, she's been announced as a "guest star" in a one-off Muppet Show special for Disney+, which will premiere in 2026.

Previous Alice in Wonderland versions include the 1951 animated movie by Disney and Tim Burton's 2010 take with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. 

The story comes from Victorian author Lewis Carroll, who first published Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a children's novel in 1865.

It tells the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands in a fantasy world of talking animals and creatures.

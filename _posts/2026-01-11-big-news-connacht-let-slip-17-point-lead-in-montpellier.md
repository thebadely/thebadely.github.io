Montpellier scored three tries in the final 15 minutes to claim a thrilling 33-31 victory over Connacht in Pool One in the Challenge Cup. 

Connacht let a 17-point lead slip and Stuart Hogg converted Valentin Welsch's 74th-minute try to book Montpellier's place in the knockout stages.

Despite a fourth consecutive defeat in all competitions, Connacht can still reach the last 16 if they overcome bottom side US Montauban in their final pool fixture on Saturday.

Thomas Darmon's converted try gave the hosts an early lead at the Septeo Stadium but Connacht hit back through scrum-half Ben Murphy. 

Montpellier regained the lead as hooker Lyam Akrab crossed from a rolling maul, but opposite number Dylan Tierney-Martin responded and Sam Gilbert's second conversion levelled the game once again. 

Finn Treacy's try put the Irish province ahead for the first time, and a conversion and penalty from Gilbert handed Connacht a deserved 24-14 lead at the break. 

Gilbert's superb afternoon continued as he crossed and converted his own try, which secured the four-try bonus-point and Connacht looked to be in a strong position going into the final quarter of the game.

However, a late flurry from Montpellier meant the hosts would end the game in style. After earlier being denied by Gilbert's try-saving tackle, wing Melvyn Rates' try was converted by Hogg, but the former Scotland international missed from the tee after Alexis Bernadet touched down out wide with 11 minutes to play.

But there was late drama as replacement prop Welsch scored under the posts to level the game, and Hogg slotted the conversion for what would be the winning kick. 

Connacht still leave France with two bonus-points and victory on Saturday over US Monatuban, who are without a win in three matches, will confirm a place in the knockout stages.

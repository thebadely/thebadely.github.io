Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Bethany Firth claimed two of her five World Championship gold medals at Manchester 2023

Bethany Firth will compete at her fifth World Para-Swimming Championships at September's competition in Singapore from 21-27 September.

The six-time Paralympic champion gave birth to her daughter Charlotte last August before setting her sights on a return to the pool, with her selection to the 22-strong GB team confirmed.

Firth will compete in the S14/SB14/SM14 category and joins team-mate Alice Tai with the most appearances at the World Championships with five.

The 29-year-old Ards SC athlete has won five golds between the 2022 and 2023 World Championships and is also the 2022 Commonwealth Games' S14 200m freestyle champion.

Her inclusion in the GB team is viewed as a major boost considering her wealth of experience in top level competition.

"Following the amazing and inspiring success of the team at Paris 2024 I am excited to see both our seasoned international athletes, and a number of athletes new to the senior team compete against the world's best in Singapore in September," said Aquatics GB lead for para-swimming, Adam Clarke.

"This first World Championships of the post Paris period is a great opportunity to assess where we are in our journey towards the 2028 Los Angeles Paralympics. 

"It promises to be a fantastic showcase of our sport in what is an iconic location."

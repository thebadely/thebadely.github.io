It has been recently reported that Tyrone May (right) was sin-binned in the 25th minute of Hull KR's win at Salford on Thursday

Hull KR scrum-half Tyrone May has been banned for two matches for questioning the integrity of a match official in the win over Salford last week.

The 29-year-old Australian was sent to the sin bin in the 74-12 victory over the Super League strugglers on Thursday.

He will now miss the table-toppers' games at home to Castleford and away to second-placed Wigan Warriors.

May, who has also received 12 penalty points, has scored four tries in 18 league appearances this season.

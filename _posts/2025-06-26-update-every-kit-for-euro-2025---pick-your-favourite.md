According to new developments, A major tournament means new kits and we are in for a treat at Euro 2025.

There are some bold new designs and other shirts we have seen before, but which is your favourite?

BBC Sport looks at the home and away kits for all 16 teams. Take a look through and vote at the bottom of this page.

Both Belgium kits feature geometric patterns "inspired by the abstract art that emerged in the nation from the 1920s".

Two instant classics from Denmark, with a retro collar on the home shirt and a vintage round neck on the away number.

A nod to the past for England's home shirt with a vibrant red and blue print across the chest, while the away jersey features a more modern design.

Designer Klaus Haapaniemi collaborated on Finland's new kits, which pay homage to "national romanticism, nature, and the curved lines of Art Nouveau architecture".

Two crisp new designs from France, with a tweed-like texture on the home shirt and diagonal stitching across the chest of the away shirt.

Germany celebrate 125 years of the national team with their retro home shirt, with a modern away kit celebrating "the rich street art scene found across the country".

A home kit "inspired by the flow of the glaciers of Iceland" and an away shirt "channelling the fluid movement of the northern lights".

Norway's knitwear pattern features on the sleeves of their home shirt, while the away jersey aims to evoke morning light over snowy landscapes.

Portugal's home shirt features a symbol found on the Portugal coat of arms and team emblem, with futuristic graphics seen on their away number.

Sweden's classic yellow home shirt is inspired by the skies of Midsummer's Day, while the away shirt fades out from dark to light.

Hosts Switzerland's classy home design features traditional Swiss textile monograms, while their away shirt "nods to the Jungfraujoch railway station in the Alps, famously the highest in Europe - bright white with a mountainous design".

Wales will arrive at their first major tournament in style with a classic scarlet colourway for the home shirt and an away kit featuring intersecting wavy lines which mimic the shape of the traditional Welsh love spoon - an ancient symbol of loyalty and togetherness.

England's Wyatt-Hodge and Bell lead Brave to win over Phoenix

The Hundred women's competition, Southampton

Southern Brave 139-7 (100 balls): Wyatt-Hodge 59 (39); Arlott 2-19

Birmingham Phoenix 124 (99 balls): Kalis 44 (34); Bell 3-17

Southern Brave won by 15 runs

Scorecard. Table

England batter Danni Wyatt-Hodge's 59 from 39 balls and a fine all-round display from Sophie Devine led Southern Brave to a 15-run win against Birmingham Phoenix in the women's Hundred. 

Phoenix slipped to 22-3 in pursuit of 140 to win, but captain Ellyse Perry led a revival with stands of 37 with England's Amy Jones and 36 with Sterre Kalis. 

The visitors were in a strong position with 45 needed from the last 30 balls, but New Zealand all-rounder Devine crucially dismissed Perry for 26 to spark a collapse from 95-4 to 124 all out. 

Devine also held on to the catch to dismiss Jones for 20, removed Ailsa Lister for one and executed a brilliant run out in her follow-through to get rid of Megan Schutt for seven as Phoenix's lower order buckled under the pressure, with nobody able to support Kalis' 44 from 34 balls.

England seamer Lauren Bell also impressed for Brave, with 3-17 to continue her fine form after a three-wicket haul in their opening win against Manchester Originals on Wednesday.

Earlier, Wyatt-Hodge added 52 for the third wicket with Devine, who made 27, after Maia Bouchier fell cheaply for six and South Africa's Laura Wolvaardt made a fluent 28. 

The opener's half-century was the ninth of her Hundred career, the most for any batter in the women's competition as she surpassed Nat Sciver-Brunt's eight, while Bell overtook Amanda-Jade Wellington as the tournament's all-time leading wicket-taker with 47. 

Brave had a solid platform at 120-2 with 15 balls remaining, but Phoenix fought back with a flurry of wickets and the hosts were pegged back to 139-7. 

Australia seamer Megan Schutt and England's Em Arlott were the standout bowlers with 2-23 and 2-19 respectively. 

The attendance of 11,167 set a new record for a women's Hundred match at the Utilita Bowl, surpassing the previous best of 10,911 from 2024.

Cross and Perrin star as Superchargers beat Rockets

The Hundred women's competition, Trent Bridge

Trent Rockets 128-8 (100 balls): Gardner 61 (32); Cross 3-31

Northern Superchargers 129-2 (79 balls): Perrin 72* (40); Graham 1-22

Superchargers won by eight wickets

Scorecard. Table

Teenager opening batter Davina Perrin hit a superb unbeaten 72 as Northern Superchargers thrashed Trent Rockets on Sunday to made it two wins from two.

After a fantastic bowling effort kept the Rockets to 128-8, Perrin thumped 12 boundaries in her 40-ball knock to take the Superchargers to an eight-wicket win with 21 balls to spare.

It could have been worse for the home side were it not for captain Ash Gardner, who made an enterprising 61 from 32 balls to rescue Rockets from 5-3 early in the match.

England seamer Kate Cross was the pick of the Superchargers attack, taking 3-31, while left-arm spinner Linsey Smith also impressed with 1-19 from her 20 balls.

A miserable day for the Rockets began with an early run out as Georgia Wareham, with just one stump to aim at, got the direct hit to remove Bryony Smith and, Gardner's counter-attacking innings aside, things only got worse for the hosts.

They offered precious little with the bat either side of Gardner's knock and were given the run-around by Perrin in the field.

The 18-year-old made a flying start as she hit seven boundaries in the powerplay to take Superchargers to 40-0 and they could have afforded to cruise from there.

Perrin got to her maiden Hundred fifty from 28 balls and was able to have a brief breather as Phoebe Litchfield came in and took the lead, smashing 22 from 10 balls.

Once Litchfield went, it was back over to Perrin and, alongside Annabel Sutherland, she got the Superchargers over the line after just 79 balls.

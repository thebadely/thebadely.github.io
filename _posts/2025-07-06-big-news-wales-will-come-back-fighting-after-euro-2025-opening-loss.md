Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Lily Woodham spent a loan spell at Crystal Palace from Seattle Reign last season

Defender Lily Woodham insists Wales will not be "too down" and "come back fighting" following defeat by the Netherlands in their opening game of Euro 2025.

Wales, making their debut at a major finals, were beaten 3-0 by the 2017 European champions in Lucerne.

Rhian Wilkinson's side face another tough game on Wednesday in St Gallen against France, who beat reigning champions England 2-1.

"We can't get too down about it," Seattle Reign's Woodham said of the defeat by the Dutch.

"It was a big occasion for us, and not to make excuses at all, we were a bit shaky

"We know in ourselves what we need to do better and that's something we'll definitely work on as a group.

"We'll look at it, review it and try and be positive for the next one. We'll come back fighting.

"Now we know the reality of these major tournaments and what you've got to give and the work rate you have to put in.

"The teams that we are playing against are top level and have been here before."

Hayley Ladd said defeat against the Netherlands was a "harsh reminder" of playing at a major finals.

"It was a nervy opening game," the Everton player said.

"Obviously a difficult scoreline in the end but it's the start to our journey here and we know we've got lots to improve on and still really positive as well.

"At least we've got a foundation now to build and grow with these next two games.

"We obviously know the standards of this level of football now and that's probably a harsh reminder as well that we've really got to be at our very best to compete with these teams.

"I feel we're capable of that - we just need to go up a few levels."

Let's dive into the details: Robert Vilahamn joined Tottenham in July 2023

Tottenham have sacked head coach Robert Vilahamn after two years in charge.

The Swede led Spurs to their first Women's FA Cup final in May 2024 but his side finished second-bottom in this season's Women's Super League.

Relegated Crystal Palace were the only side to concede more goals than Tottenham and the club's points tally of 20 was 11 fewer than they recorded in the 2023-24 campaign.

"There have been some special moments during Robert's tenure," said women's managing director Andy Rogers.

"However, results and performances this season have not been to the level we would expect and now is the right time to make a change."

Vilahamn follows senior assistant coach Vicky Jepson, who had already left Spurs to take up a role with the United States women's youth teams.

His departure comes two days after Tottenham's men's side sacked head coach Ange Postecoglou, despite winning the Europa League last month.

Here’s what you need to know: Twenty-nine people have been arrested in London after police said they were responding to a protest in support of the banned group Palestine Action.

The Metropolitan Police said those arrested were being held on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act 2000 and had been taken into custody. 

Pictures from the Westminster demonstration showed a small group holding placards reading "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action". 

As of Saturday, the group is proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000, after lawyers acting on its behalf failed with a court bid to block the ban on Friday.

The designation means being a member of, or showing support for Palestine Action, is a criminal offence and could lead to up to 14 years in prison.

In an earlier statement, the Met said: "Officers are responding to a protest in support of Palestine Action in Parliament Square.

"The group is now proscribed and expressing support for them is a criminal offence."

Protesters holding home-made, cardboard placards gathered near the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Parliament Square on Saturday. 

Pictures emerged showing police surrounding the group and detaining people, with one woman seen being taken away in handcuffs by officers. 

The protest group Defend Our Juries wrote to Met Police commissioner Mark Rowley on Friday to inform the force a demonstration where placards expressing support of Palestine Action would be displayed was to go ahead on Saturday.

In a statement released after the arrests, the group said: "It's a relief to know that Counter Terrorism police have nothing better to do."

The government moved to ban Palestine Action after an estimated £7m of damage was caused to planes at RAF Brize Norton last month during a protest the group said it was behind.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to proscribe the group last month, calling damage to two military aircraft "disgraceful" and claiming the group had a "long history of unacceptable criminal damage".

Palestine Action has engaged in activities that have predominantly targeted arms companies since the start of the current war in Gaza.

The group's ban came into effect on Saturday after High Court judge Mr Justice Chamberlain refused its request to temporarily block the move, saying the claim was "insufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in maintaining the order in force".

Raza Husain KC, barrister for Palestine Action's co-founder Huda Ammori, who brought the complaint, told the court banning the group would be "ill-considered" and an "authoritarian abuse" of power.

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The death toll in Gaza has since risen to more than 57,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel has strongly denied allegations of genocide, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.

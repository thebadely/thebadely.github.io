It has been recently reported that More than two million people have attended a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, city officials say. 

The pop star's biggest ever concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy. They expect it could bring in $100m (Â£75m) to the local economy. 

Saturday's performance was part of a promotional tour for Lady Gaga's eighth album, Mayhem, whose songs include Abracadabra and Die With a Smile. She last performed in Brazil in 2012.

Some fans - known as Gaga's "Little Monsters" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.

A massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event. 

Lady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.

"You waited for me, you waited for more than 10 years for me," an emotional Lady Gaga told the crowds as she unfurled a Brazilian flag.  

"Brazil, I'm ready. I'm going to give it my all."

The pop star appeared in Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team. 

Thousands sang along with her best known hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra, creating an electric atmosphere as many waved rainbow-themed fans and watched on huge screens along the beach. 

Fans travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance.  

One man, 28-year-old Luan Messias, said he spent all night on a bus from Itanhaem in neighbouring Sao Paulo state.

Alisha Duarte, 22, told AFP news agency she started queuing at 0740 in the morning. "Lady Gaga is worth it! It's going to get super crowded, but we'll survive," she said. 

Another fan, Paulo Oliveira, explained why people were so excited about the concert. She "tells us that we can be who we are, that we can be different and that being different is cool," he told Reuters. 

It's going to be an "unforgettable show", concert attendee Lai Borges told Reuters on her way in. "It's going to be emotional and I'm going to cry a lot," she said. 

As the event drew to a close, Lady Gaga told the audience - in a reference to the nickname for Lady Gaga fans - "we are monsters and monsters never die," and she brought the concert to a close with Bad Romance, perhaps her most famous song.

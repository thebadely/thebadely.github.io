Let's dive into the details: Two tries from Sarah Beckett helped Gloucester-Hartpury continue their winning run

Defending champions Gloucester-Hartpury maintained their perfect start to the Premiership Women's Rugby season with a 29-28 victory over Trailfinders.

A late fightback saw Trailfinders come back from being 29-14 down in the 62nd minute, but they were unable to fully turn the result around.

Alana Borland's early try had given the visitors the lead before tries from Jade Shekells, Neve Jones and Kate Williams gave Gloucester-Hartpury a 19-7 advantage at the break.

Two tries from Sarah Beckett, either side of one from Trailfinders' Vicky Laflin, proved the difference, though. Borland and Niamh Gallagher hit back as Trailfinders made a late surge, but two tries with conversions were not enough.

Victory means Gloucester-Hartpury have now won 17 PWR games in a row, going back to last season, with their winning streak stretching for more than a year.

Second-placed Exeter Chiefs kept up the pressure with a 41-10 success at home to Bristol Bears earlier in the day.

Leicester Tigers, meanwhile, remain bottom of the table and are yet to pick up any points following a 56-28 defeat at home to Harlequins.

It has been recently reported that Olivia Mathias helped Wales win a mixed relay silver at the 2022 Commonwealth Games

Great Britain's Olivia Mathias finished third as Cassandre Beaugrand claimed victory in the World Triathlon Championship Series in Alghero.

Beaugrand crashed out on the bike leg of the previous race in Yokohama but the Frenchwoman bounced back to win the third race of the series in Italy.

The reigning Olympic and world champion was chasing Wales' Mathias and Bianca Seregni of Italy on the second lap of the swim before bridging the gap on the bike.

The leaders then distanced themselves from the likes of Lisa Tertsch and GB's Beth Potter in the chase pack and built an unassailable lead on the 10km run.

Beaugrand, 28, clinched victory in 1 hour 55 minutes 55 seconds - 38 seconds before Seregni in second, with Mathias 31 seconds further back in third.

It was a first series win of the year for the 2024 champion while both Seregni and Mathias, 26, earned a spot on the series podium for the first time, with Potter in eighth.

Brazil's Miguel Hidalgo won the men's race in 1:44:05, crossing 28 seconds ahead of Australia's Matt Hauser, who was the winner in Yokohama.

Leo Bergere of France came in 64 seconds after Hidalgo in third, with Hugo Milner the best-placed Briton in eighth.

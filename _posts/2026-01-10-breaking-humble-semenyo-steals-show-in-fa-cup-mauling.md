Antoine Semenyo scores on his debut as Manchester City beat Exeter in style

Having signed off at Bournemouth in fairytale fashion, Antoine Semenyo started life at Manchester City in a similarly dreamy manner just four days later by stealing the show in a record-equalling win for the club.

The forward completed a transfer from the Cherries on Friday and, although it was Exeter City in front of him for his debut, the 26-year-old duly impressed in a 10-1 FA Cup third-round mauling of the League One side.

Semenyo showed early signs of why City decided to spend Â£65m to bring him to Etihad Stadium.

He became a fans' favourite during his three years on the south coast and a goal and assist on his first start will go a long way to ensuring supporters at his new club take to him in the same way.

The Ghanaian was named man of the match in a contest where City racked up double figures for the first time under Pep Guardiola.

It was City's biggest victory since a 10-1 Second Division thrashing of Huddersfield in 1987, and biggest in the FA Cup since a 12-0 qualifying round win over Liverpool Stanley while playing as Ardwick in 1890-91.

It was also the biggest FA Cup win from a top-flight side since Tottenham Hotspur beat Crewe 13-2 in a fourth-round replay in 1960.

With boss Guardiola serving a one-game touchline ban for receiving three yellow cards, assistant Pep Lijnders stood in for duties during the game and post-match.

"I think a lot of good performances today," said Lijnders. "A lot of good individual performances. I think when the team plays like that it becomes easier for the individual, but Antoine is settling well.

"He is a humble guy and we have followed him for a long time, but he brings something to the frontline - what we really want and what we need.

"He can attack quick, he wants to chase, he is a guy who doesn't stop. I think you see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style. It's nice to have him with us."

Semenyo scores as Man City hit 10 past Exeter

Antoine Semenyo became the first player to both score and assist a goal on his Manchester City debut since Sergio Aguero against Swansea in August 2011

Semenyo's beaming smile at full-time was as bright as the stadium floodlights after playing a major part in his side's rampant and ruthless success.

Star striker Erling Haaland played only the first 45 minutes, missing Semenyo's goal contributions, but will be licking his lips at the service he may well receive from City's new recruit.

A delightful ball into the box from the left flank was finished off by Rico Lewis for their fifth goal, before he showed class and composure to make it 6-0.

"It's not a surprise for us because everyone has seen how good of a player he is in the Premier League," said Lewis.

"Everybody wanted him, there's a reason for that and he's shown that today. It feels like a seamless transition into the team.

"He's a really good person as well which is another positive."

Having scored 10 Premier League goals this season for Bournemouth, Semenyo's first for City saw him run on to Rayan Cherki's pass and slipping a finish under Exeter goalkeeper Joe Whitworth.

In turn, he became the first player to both score and assist a goal on his City debut since Sergio Aguero against Swansea in August 2011. 

That is some player to emulate, given the Argentine striker went on to become City's record goalscorer during a decade with them, lifting five Premier League titles, six League Cups and an FA Cup triumph in 2019.

Semenyo has started in perfect fashion as victory over Exeter made it 12 unbeaten games in all competitions for City as they continue to fight on all fronts. 

Three consecutive Premier League draws has left them six points behind leaders Arsenal, while their next game is the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final at Newcastle on Tuesday.

Lijnders said: "The last three games we wanted, of course, we created the chances to score more goals and to win the game. That would have already created a different position in the league.

"But overall, I think we have a really special group. The amount of experienced players who take lead of the team, the way they guide all the others, the way new players are settling in and the energy. I'm not only talking about the games, but especially training. In the training centre it's special and we are on our way.

"We now play the semi-final for the League Cup, we go further here in the FA Cup and we are in a good position in the Champions League. We want to build on that."

The scoreline ticked to 9-0 on 86 minutes when impressive debutant Ryan McAidoo drilled in and the 17-year-old's finish was greeted with chants of "we want 10" from the home supporters.

Although 19-year-old George Birch pulled a stunning goal back for the Grecians, Lewis smashed home as City became the first top-flight side to score 10 or more goals in any English competition since Liverpool beat Fulham 10-0 in the League Cup in September 1986.

Exeter boss Gary Caldwell, who was part of the Wigan Athletic squad that upset City in the 2013 FA Cup final, said: "When the team sheet came in, it was an experience we didn't envisage.

"I think my players were excited for two or three minutes, but then they got on the pitch and realised he [Haaland] is the best number nine in the world.

"It's a lesson that when one of the best managers of all time needs to win a game he picks a team to win it. The respect they showed was outstanding - they did what Man City should have done to us.

"It was a really humbling experience. Our season will not be defined by this - it will be defined on the remaining league games."

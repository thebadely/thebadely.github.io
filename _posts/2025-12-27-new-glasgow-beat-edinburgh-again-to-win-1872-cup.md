Glasgow Warriors made it back-to-back wins over Edinburgh with victory in a largely drab affair at Murrayfield to win the 1872 Cup for the fourth successive season.

Holding a 24-12 aggregate lead from last weekend's first leg, Jamie Dobie's first-half try gave Glasgow a 7-3 half-time advantage, with Cammy Scott kicking Edinburgh's only points of the half.

The second period was largely a non-event until George Horne burrowed over from close range and Dobie scored a wonderful second to seal the win.

After a blunt attacking performance at Hampden in the first leg, Edinburgh had stated their aim to fire more shots this time around, but although Scott knocked over a penalty to put the home side into an early lead, they once again failed to offer any meaningful threat.

There was no shortage of desire and physicality on show but the match struggled to get in to any sort of flow, not least because of a host of injury stoppages throughout.

The first real moment of quality came from Glasgow fly-half Adam Hastings, who  collected a pass from Horne, stepped inside a defender and delivered a precise cross-field kick for Dobie to score in the corner. 

Edinburgh's attack was again failing to offer much, though they did get a bit of encouragement with half an hour to go when Glasgow flanker Angus Fraser was sent to the sin-bin for a high shot on Scott.

Even the numerical advantage could not spark Edinburgh into life and the action near either try-line was almost non-existent.

Warriors eventually roused themselves for one last push and despite some desperate defence, Edinburgh were breached when Horne sniped near the line to go over for the game-clinching try.

Dobie added the icing by scoring his second in lovely fashion, deftly kicking ahead and winning the sprint to the line as Glasgow ended an uninspiring affair in fine style.

Let's dive into the details: The Daily Telegraph leads with the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's comments saying the prime minister's plan to recognise a Palestinian state amounts to a reward for terrorism. In an essay for the paper - focusing on her foreign policy plans - Badenoch says Sir Keir Starmer is "incapable of leading Britain on the world stage". She also criticises what she calls the reckless surrender of the Chagos islands.

The Daily Mail focuses on the Russian fighter jets that flew into Estonian airspace on Friday. The paper says two more jets breached the safety zone of a Polish oil rig in the Baltic sea in what it calls a "show of force".

The Financial Times reports that the prime minister is to press ahead with the introduction of digital IDs to curb illegal migration. The paper notes an announcement could happen as early as this month's Labour party conference. The Daily Express ridicules Sir Keir's migrants return deal with France, after three people were sent back in the first five days while - it says - packed Channel boats continue to arrive. "So how is the one-in, one-out scheme going Keir?" reads its headline.

Sir Lindsay Hoyle's warning that China has been given a licence to spy on Parliament leads the Times. The paper says the speaker of the Commons has written to the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, about his concerns after the decision to drop charges against two men accused of espionage on behalf of Beijing. Speaking to the Times, Sir Lindsay says the decision leaves the door open to foreign actors trying to spy on the Commons.

The Guardian says Education Secretary Bridget Philipson - whom the paper describes as "Number 10's preferred choice" to become Labour's next deputy leader - has strongly hinted that the two-child benefit cap could be scrapped. Ms Philipson has described the cap introduced by the Conservatives as "a spiteful attack on children".

It has been recently reported that Ioan Cunningham led Fiji to victory over Wales at the 2025 Rugby World Cup

Former Wales and Fiji head coach Ioan Cunningham has joined Scotland women's backroom staff.

Cunningham takes up a new assistant role and will work closely with Sione Fukofuka who was appointed head coach in December.

Cunningham led Fiji to last summer's Rugby World Cup, where they impressed in the same pool as Scotland and Wales.

During a three-year stint with his native Wales, he helped them achieve their highest ever World Rugby ranking of sixth before leaving by mutual agreement in November 2024 amid a player contract row.

Prior to his move to the women's game, Cunningham worked as a forwards coach for Scarlets and Wales Under-20s head coach.

"I am really honoured and excited to have the opportunity to work with Scottish Rugby, especially working with the Scotland senior women's team," said Cunningham.

"I'm really looking forward to working with such talented players and staff, adding to the continued growth and development of women's rugby in Scotland.

"I have a personal connection to Scotland as my grandfather was from Kilmarnock, which makes having this opportunity a proud moment for me and my family."

Experts revealed that Lennart Karl, 17, scored Bayern Munich's opener against Club Brugge

Youth took centre stage in the Champions League this week, with six teenagers lighting up the scoresheet - the joint-most in a single round of the competition.

Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly were among those that dazzled, but those names need little introduction by now.

Instead, BBC Sport looks at the emerging wonderkids who announced themselves among Europe's brightest stars.

This article could be made up entirely of Chelsea players given the success their youngsters had in a 5-1 demolition of Ajax.

The Blues gave minutes to 10 players aged 21 or younger, while they became the first team in Champions League history to have three teenage scorers.

Marc Guiu was first on the scoresheet, with the 19-year-old Spaniard - known as a powerful, quick number nine - poking home to briefly become the club's youngest goalscorer in the competition.

His record on Wednesday night lasted for just 33 minutes with Estevao Willian, who is one year, three months and 20 days younger, netting a penalty.

Already a Brazil international with nine caps, Estevao was described as a "special talent" by ex-England striker Wayne Rooney when he scored a late winner against Liverpool earlier this month, while his Chelsea team-mate Jorrel Hato - another teenager who started against Ajax - said Barca sensation Yamal is the only player of comparison.

English winger Tyrique George scored Chelsea's fifth goal, and the 19-year-old is already a familiar name after a breakthrough season with the Blues last term when he played 750 minutes in their run to the Europa Conference League title.

Reggie Walsh, a technical, deep-lying playmaker who turned 17 on Monday, broke another record for the club by becoming their youngest player in Europe's top tier competition, while Jamie Gittens, 21, became the youngest Chelsea player to create five or more chances in a Champions League match - a record previously held by Eden Hazard.

Viktor Dadason came on in the 75th minute of Copenhagen's defeat

Age: 17. Position: Striker. Nationality: Icelandic.

At just 17 years and 113 days old, Viktor Dadason became the third youngest player to score in the modern Champions League era when he netted a consolation goal for Copenhagen in the 90th minute of their 4-2 defeat by Borussia Dortmund.

It was his first goal for the side, having made his debut in the Danish Superliga on Friday.

Dadason has represented Iceland at various youth levels and his headed goal on Tuesday showed he has the skill and potential to become a physically dominant centre-forward.

Age: 17. Position: Attacking midfielder. Nationality: German.

Lennart Karl wasted no time in showcasing why he is one of Germany's brightest prospects on his first start for Bayern Munich.

The 17-year-old waltzed effortlessly past two defenders before rifling a left-footed shot into the top corner from the edge of the box to score Bayern's opener after five minutes in their 4-0 win over Club Brugge.

His confidence should come as no surprise. Karl, who normally plays in the number 10 role, scored 27 goals and made 11 assists in just 18 matches while playing for Bayern's under-17s last season.

Fernandez joined Barcelona from Val Minor Nigran in 2022

Age: 17. Position: Midfielder. Nationality: Spanish.

The latest talent from the famed La Masia academy production line, Dro Fernandez made his first senior competitive start last month after taking part in Barcelona's pre-season tour of Japan.

The 17-year-old Spaniard showcased his vision with an assist in Tuesday's 6-1 win over Olympiacos, receiving the ball on the half-turn before driving into space and threading a perfectly weighted pass into the path of Fermin Lopez.

Fernandez is a forward-thinking midfielder with superb ball control in tight spaces - attributes which have earned him comparisons to Barcelona legends Andreas Iniesta and Thiago Alcantara by his youth coaches.

In 2021, Bardghji, at the age of 16, became Copenhagen's youngest player and youngest goalscorer

Age: 19. Position: Winger. Nationality: Swedish.

Roony Bardghji, who joined Barcelona from Copenhagen in the summer, is another teenager who provided an assist for Lopez, who scored a hat-trick.

The 19-year-old showed off his quick feet and flair by beating an Olympiacos defender with the 'elastico' skill before fizzing in a cross from which Lopez fired home.

Born in Kuwait to Syrian parents, Bardghji - said to have "similar characteristics to Mohamed Salah" - moved to Sweden at the age of six and made his international debut for Sweden earlier this month.

In 2023, he scored an 87th-minute winner against Manchester United in the Champions League group stage - a result that helped Copenhagen qualify for the knockout rounds and condemned United to a bottom-place finish.

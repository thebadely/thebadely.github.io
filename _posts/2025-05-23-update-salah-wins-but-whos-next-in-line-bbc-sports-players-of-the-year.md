'Oh my goodness!' - Salah's best Premier League Liverpool goals

Mohamed Salah is expected to win a clean sweep of end of season awards this summer after starring as Liverpool cantered to the Premier League title.

The Egyptian is way out on his own for goals scored (28) and assists (18) and has set  the record for the most goal involvements in a 38-game season.

When asked for their player of the season, a host of BBC Sport pundits, reporters and commentators were in agreement - Salah has been the standout player.

BBC Radio 5 Live pundit, and Premier League-winning striker, Chris Sutton, said: "His numbers are outrageous, he has scored or assisted 46 Premier League goals this season - that's more than Manchester United have managed. 

"How can you not vote for Mo Salah as your player of the year? Anyone not voting for Salah is a buffoon."

So, to mix things up, we asked for their other leading players of the campaign - but only allowed them to pick one more player from Liverpool.

Here are the picks and you can vote for who has impressed you most with their selections at the bottom of the page.

1: Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)

He's my 'other' Liverpool player because he is their leader at the back and he's been as good for them this season as he was before his cruciate ligament injury in 2020.

2: Murillo (Nottingham Forest)

I'd definitely have a Forest player in my three and Chris Wood has obviously scored a lot of their goals. They have dried up a bit recently, but after all the ups and downs of his career it is still a great story.

I am going to go with Murillo over Wood, though. No-one had really heard of him before Forest signed him in 2023 but he's been such an integral part of their superb season. 

I could have easily picked his centre-half partner Nikola Milenkovic because he has been phenomenal as well, and a lot of Forest's success has been based on the solid foundation they give the team.

3: Declan Rice (Arsenal)

He is just a phenomenal footballer whether he is playing as a number six or number eight. The drive he gives this Arsenal side is incredible and I just really love watching him play. He has been excellent throughout.

1: Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)

No longer potential. Isak transitioned into a genuinely world-class striker this season in full living colour.

2: Declan Rice (Arsenal)

Consistently excellent in Arsenal's midfield... and his two free-kicks versus Real Madrid were among the season's highlights.

3: Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)

If Mohamed Salah supplies the stardust, then Van Dijk brings the glue. Poetry in motion.

Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd)

In a season, Europa League apart - although even that ended in defeat in the final - of complete mediocrity for Manchester United, captain Bruno Fernandes has been a shining light. 

Often questioned about his suitability for leadership, Fernandes has at least tried to set standards of quality and resilience several levels above most of his team-mates. 

It may be strange to offer up a Footballer Of The Year candidate for a team so low in the Premier League, but Fernandes is a deserving candidate.

Declan Rice (Arsenal)

Arsenal's season has fallen short when it comes to winning trophies, but the consistent excellence of Declan Rice has been a stand-out. 

He scored those two sensational free-kicks in the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid at Emirates Stadium, then scored the winner against Newcastle United that confirmed Arsenal will be in Europe's elite competition next season. When Harry Kane finally steps off the international stage, he should be England's next captain.

Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)

No-one can argue Van Dijk's Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah doesn't deserve the accolade of player of the year, but plenty might argue that Liverpool's captain would also have been a worthy winner. 

He was the leader and defensive kingpin as fellow Dutchman Arne Slot won the Premier League in his first season as manager, with the defender showing no signs of reduced powers. Everyone at Anfield was elated when he signed a new two-year contract, even though he is 34 in July.

Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)

Virgil van Dijk might have played the most minutes (at the time of writing) in Liverpool's title campaign but his fellow Dutchman, another ever present, has excelled. He has become such a key player under Arne Slot as a midfield lynchpin and has been a model of high consistency.

Declan Rice (Arsenal)

His two memorable free-kick strikes against Real Madrid will live long in the memory but his all-action performances saw stand out in Arsenal's run to the Champions League semi-finals. I recall him making a lung-bursting run in Eindhoven even when Arsenal were comfortably ahead during their 7-1 win at PSV. Those energy levels and desire were also evident in a majestic display in Madrid.

Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)

His goal ratio is highly impressive but he's a quality footballer. His instinctive finish in the League Cup final highlights his prowess in front of goal but his movement, awareness and technical ability allow him to combine his skills with speed, meaning he's a constant threat.

He is a world-class talent and Champions League qualification will be crucial for Newcastle United to ward off potential suitors.

Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool)

Has bonded the Liverpool defence and attack together brilliantly and made the massive step up from Brighton.

Alexander Isak (Newcastle)

Has developed into a top-class striker. Am not sure about the Thierry Henry comparisons but he's been as good as any this season.

Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace)

A stellar end to the season capped with an FA Cup final match-winner that looked easy but few could pull off.

Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd)

No player in the Premier League has created more chances than Bruno Fernandes and doing that in a struggling Manchester United team is all the more impressive.

Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)

Probably Liverpool's most important player, bar Mohamed Salah, given he helps build attacks at the base of Arne Slot's midfield in their possession-based system.

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea)

Most people considered Cole Palmer to be Chelsea's most important player but the British transfer record midfielder has been the star for Enzo Maresca's team this season.

Alexander Isak (Newcastle)

The Sweden striker has spearheaded Newcastle's Champions League challenge and helped them end their 56-year trophy drought by winning the Carabao Cup. He has also become the first Magpies player since Alan Shearer in 2003-04 to score more than 22 league goals.

Virgil Van Dijk (Liverpool)

While team-mate Mohamed Salah will take the individual awards, defender Van Dijk has also been central to their success. He has made the most touches in the Premier League, the most passes, the fourth most interceptions and is also in the top 10 for clearances.

Murillo (Nottingham Forest)

The defender has been integral to Nottingham Forest's exceptional season, his partnership with Nikola Milenkovic crucial at the back. He has made the most clearances in the Premier League this season, including three off the line.

Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)

The Cameroon international has had a superb campaign for Brentford, netting 19 Premier League goals to keep the Bees in the hunt for a European place next season. Some of the top-flight's 'bigger' clubs may come circling this summer.

Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace)

The Crystal Palace winger will go down in Eagles history as the player who scored the winning goal for the club's first major trophy, stunning Manchester City in the FA Cup final.

The brilliant Eze has scored a total of 15 goals this season, timing his run to perfection with seven in his last six games for Oliver Glasner's side.

Nikola Milenkovic (Nottingham Forest)

The bargain signing of the season. Forest paid just Â£12m to sign the Serb from Fiorentina and he has marshalled the backline superbly.

Milenkovic's performances in defence guarantee European football for Nuno Espirito Santo's side next season, but will it be the Champions League or Europa League?

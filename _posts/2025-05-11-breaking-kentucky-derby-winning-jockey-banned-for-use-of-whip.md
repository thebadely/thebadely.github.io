Let's dive into the details: The jockey who won the Kentucky Derby has been fined and suspended for using the riding crop too much during the race.

Jockey Junior Alvarado struck Sovereignty, the three-year-old colt that won the crown, eight times during the race, officials say.

Regulations say a rider may strike a horse a maximum of six times with a crop.

Alvarado was fined $62,000 (Â£46,600) and suspended for two upcoming racing days at Churchill Downs by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority.

The fine is usually 10% of the jockey's winnings, which was $31,000 from his $310,000 prize - but because it was his second offence the fine was doubled, per the rules.

Sovereignty beat favourite Journalism to win the 151st Kentucky Derby on 3 May.

It was Alvarado's first Derby crown, and the first for Sovereignty's owner, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The horse was trained by veteran William Mott.

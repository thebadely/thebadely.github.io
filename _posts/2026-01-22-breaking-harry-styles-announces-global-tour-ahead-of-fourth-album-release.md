Let's dive into the details: Harry Styles has announced a 50-show global tour ahead of the release of his highly-anticipated fourth album, Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally.

The Together, Together tour will take place across seven cities, including a whopping 30 shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. 

Shows are also scheduled in Amsterdam, London, São Paulo, Mexico City, Melbourne and Sydney between May and December.

Among those set to appear as special guests during the tour are Shania Twain, Robyn, Jorja Smith and Jamie XX.

Styles's seven month-long tour will include nights at London's Wembley Stadium between 12 and 23 June, where Twain is scheduled to appear.

Pre-sale and general tickets for the tour go on sale later this month. 

The tour will follow the release of Kiss All The time. Disco, Occasionally, set to be released on 6 March.

The three-time Grammy award-winner has been teasing fans since December with cryptic messages, mysterious websites and voice notes, all carrying the same message: "We belong together."

A single from the album, Aperture, was released on Thursday, coinciding with the tour's announcement.

The star has kept a low profile since his Love On Tour run of gigs came to an end in 2023.

Styles has been one of the UK's most recognisable musicians since he auditioned on The X Factor when he was 16 and became part of boyband One Direction.

The Worcestershire-born star started releasing his own music in 2017 after the band went on an indefinite hiatus, becoming a successful solo artist.

His first album, Harry Styles, shot to number one in the UK charts, as did the single, Sign of the Times.

His subsequent albums, Fine Line, released in 2019, and Harry's House, released in 2022, were both critically acclaimed. 

The latter sold four million copies and won Styles best album at both the Grammys and the Brit Awards.

Singles As It Was, which also reached number one in the UK charts, and Watermelon Sugar, are among his top hits.

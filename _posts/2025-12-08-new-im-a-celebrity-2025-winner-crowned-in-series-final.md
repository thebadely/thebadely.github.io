According to new developments, Spoiler warning: This article reveals details about the final of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

Social media star Angry Ginge has been crowned king of the jungle in this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

The 24-year-old Mancunian content creator, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, emerged victorious in the ITV reality show's final on Sunday after three weeks in the Australian camp.

He became the winner of the show's 25th regular series, beating fellow contestants including ex-EastEnders star Shona McGarty, Celebs Go Dating receptionist Tom Read Wilson and rapper Aitch.

The 12 celebrities completing bushtucker trials and competing on the show also included Jack Osbourne, son of Ozzy; Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley; Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp; and comedian Ruby Wax.

Sunday's final saw three contestants each complete their bushtucker trial, earning them their dream three-course meal and drink in the jungle.

McGarty's jungle journey then came to an end after she received the fewest public votes.

Ginge and Tom then joined hosts Ant and Dec, as well as the other contestants, for the announcement of the winner. 

"I feel amazing. Honestly, (it is a) dream come true," Ginge said.

"I did not think I'd go all this way, never mind win, so thank you to everyone who voted."

Deputy Labour leader and Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell congratulated the 24-year-old winner.

"It was a Mancunian series and Manchester prevailed. Well done Ginge (and Aitch and co)," Powell wrote in a social media post.

The show has included the usual mix of potentially terrifying or revolting trials for the celebrities, including parachuting into the jungle, crawling through stinky slime and encountering creatures including crocodiles. 

The launch show in November attracted more than 10 million viewers, which ITV said was its biggest audience since Euro 2024.

This year's series also included a new rule, meaning individual contestants could not be voted to do every bushtucker trial for numerous days in a row.

Show bosses decided celebrities would only be able to do "two in a row and you miss a go" in order to "give all campmates the opportunity to shine".

Ahead of the final, Ginge's sister Tasha Burtwistle revealed getting on I'm a Celebrity had been one of his "bucket list" items.

Ginge has become known for his rants about football and his team Manchester United. 

In 2021, he exploded in popularity when he uploaded a fictional outburst about struggling to get chips on a night out.

He has turned into one of the most popular streamers in the UK with 1.4 million followers.

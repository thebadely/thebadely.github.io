Let's dive into the details: Dan Ndoye has made 22 appearances for Switzerland

Nottingham Forest have signed Switzerland winger Dan Ndoye from Bologna. 

Ndoye has signed a five-year deal at the City Ground to bring his two-year stint in Italy to an end.

The 24-year-old scored nine times in 41 appearances for the Serie A side last season.

He scored the only goal in the Coppa Italia final win against AC Milan in May, helping Bologna to their first major trophy in over 50 years.

"It is a really exciting time at Forest and I knew straight away that I wanted to be a part of the project," said Ndoye.

"It's a really ambitious team with a fantastic history and I can't wait to get started."

The winger made his international debut for Switzerland in 2022 and has gone on to earn 22 caps for his country, scoring three times. 

Ndoye is Forest's third major signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Igor Jesus and Jair Cunha from Botafogo. 

Having sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United, Forest managed to convince Morgan Gibbs-White to sign a new deal at the club.

The England midfielder had looked set to join Tottenham after the club activated a Â£60m release clause in his previous deal.

Here’s what you need to know: Many of Saturday's papers feature the implications of Sir Keir Starmer's U-turn on welfare reform.

This together with the winter fuel reversal means he'll face a £4.25bn fiscal hit, according to the Financial Times. 

The Daily Telegraph says the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will need to extend a stealth tax to fill the black hole, predicting that income tax thresholds will be frozen in the autumn budget.

The Guardian warns that now the chancellor and prime minister have developed a reputation for changing course, they are likely to come under pressure on other issues, such as the two-child benefit cap.

Writing in the Daily Mail, Andrew Pierce says the latest U-turn threatens to destroy the remnants of the chancellor's political and economic credibility.

The Sun observes that Sir Keir was elected on his promise to put country before party, but has this week done the complete opposite.

A tribute to the murdered 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin by his father features prominently, with the Daily Mirror saying he showed "love and dignity in the face of such evil".

The Daily Express notes that Dr Ebenezer Anjorin wanted to honour his son's memory "not in the shadow of this tragedy but through the love and happiness that he brought".

The Times says hospitals will be paid according to how satisfied their patients are. The paper says what it calls Labour's "make or break" 10-year plan for the NHS, to be announced next week, will link doctors' pay to their success in reducing waiting lists.

The Telegraph says the founder of the Glastonbury Festival, Sir Michael Eavis, has told people to "go somewhere else" if they don't like the politics of the event.

His comments came after calls for Irish rap trio Kneecap be banned from the event. One of the band's members, Liam Og O hAnnaidh, 27, was charged with allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed terrorist organisation Hezbollah, while saying "up Hamas, up Hezbollah" at a gig in November last year.

Kneecap say they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual.

The BBC yet to confirm how much of the band's set it will televise - with the corporation adding it would be screened within its editorial guidelines.

The Mirror looks back on the first day of the festival, saying "Oh Lorde, it's a hot one," picturing the New Zealand singer, removing her T-shirt during her surprise performance.

The Guardian speaks to a couple who got married at Worthy Farm and handed out slices of their chocolate and pistachio wedding cake to other festival goers.

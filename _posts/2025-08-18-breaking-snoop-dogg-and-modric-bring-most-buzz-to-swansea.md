Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Swansea City captain Ben Cabango has won 12 caps for Wales

Swansea City captain Ben Cabango says the investment of Luka Modric and Snoop Dogg into the club has generated the "most buzz for a long time".

Former Ballon d'Or winner Modric became an investor and co-owner at Championship club Swansea in April, with rapper Snoop Dogg following suit last month.

Cabango, 25, who has been at the club 11 years, says the increased media attention has brought welcome higher expectations.

"This is the most buzz we've had around Swansea for a long time," said Cabango.

"There's a bit of expectation on us now, which is really good. 

"Hopefully we can make good things out of this season. Everyone's positive around this place."

After losing to Middlesbrough on the opening day of the season, the Swans have bounced back with home wins in the Carabao Cup and Championship.

Their midweek cup success over League Two Crawley Town was followed up by an even more impressive 1-0 victory against Sheffield United.

The wins continue head coach Alan Sheehan's impressive run of form at the Swansea.com Stadium.

"Our home games we've had since he has been in charge... six wins and one draw in the eight games," added Cabango.

"It's been solid defensively and we're always looking like we're going to score.

"It's obviously a good balance and we're always on the front foot, aggressive and I bet we're a hard team to play against."

Cameron Burgess made 18 appearances in the Premier League last season with Ipswich Town

After the departure of Harry Darling, Cabango is in the early stages of forming a new centre-back partnership with summer signing Cameron Burgess.

The 29-year-old Australia international agreed a three-year contract with Sheehan's side back in June after seeing out his contract with Ipswich Town.

Saturday's win over Sheffield United brought with it a first clean sheet of the season, and Cabango says the relationship between the two is "really improving".

"It takes quite a while to get connections," said Cabango.

"Every day we're just learning about each other and it's really improving.

"Saturday was our second game together and already we're starting to learn about each other, how he plays, how I play.

"Obviously the longer we start playing together the more we're going to learn about each other and the better it's going to be."

We've recieved no formal offer for Isak - Howe

Newcastle have not yet received a bid for their top scorer Alexander Isak, says manager Eddie Howe.

The Sweden striker is exploring his options for a potential summer move and has not travelled on the team's pre-season tour of Asia, although Newcastle initially said he has a "minor thigh injury".

A source has told BBC Sport that Liverpool are still interested in the 25-year-old, despite signing Hugo Ekitike for an initial Â£69m.

The Magpies had maintained that Isak is not for sale and although Howe admits he is not in "full control" of the player's future, he says that no offer has been submitted yet.

"He is still our player. He's contracted to us," Howe said at a news conference in Seoul.

"We, to a degree, control what is next for him. I would love to believe all possibilities are still available to us.

"My wish is that he stays, but that's not in my full control. We have not received a formal offer for Alex, from any club."

Isak joined Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022 in a deal worth about Â£60m and still has three years left on his contract.

He has scored 62 goals in 109 appearances for the Magpies, including 27 in all competitions last season.

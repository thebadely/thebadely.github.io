Let's dive into the details: Tom Christie finished his final season in New Zealand as a champion with Canterbury and Crusaders

Tom Christie says powering Newcastle Red Bulls into a glorious new era would be full compensation for missing out on an All Blacks call-up.

The 27-year-old flanker will make his debut for Newcastle against Leicester at Kingston Park on Friday night and is arguably the most significant signing since the energy drink giant took over the club in August.

Christie scored a try in New Zealand's World Under-20 Championship final win over England in 2017, before captaining the Baby Blacks in their title defence a year later.

Despite never managing to follow former age-grade team-mates Tom Jordan, Caleb Clarke and Dalton Papali'i into the All Blacks, Christie has been one of Super Rugby's most reliable and respected performers, winning three titles with Canterbury-based Crusaders and featuring for New Zealand's second-string side.

New Zealand's policy of not selecting overseas-based players means he is ineligible while playing in the north east.

"When I look back and reflect on that first half of my career back in New Zealand I am really proud of what we did achieve, albeit falling short of the black jersey," Christie told BBC Look North.

"But now we're here, we're present with this and ready to rip in and turn this club around.

"I think that will be equally as rewarding if we can, along with the other guys here, get this club into the top of the Prem or winning the Prem and then the same in Europe.

"That's going to be extremely satisfying as well."

Newcastle's last top-flight victory - a 17-12 win over Saracens - was almost exactly a year ago.

They are bottom of the Prem table after five games, and have finished the past three campaigns in the same position.

Christie said that reversing that rotten run of results is his and the club's sole focus.

"Simply, winning," he said when asked what the future holds.

"Red Bull has come on board and that's where they see this club going and I'm aligned with that.

"They're going to put the resources in place, make sure the team's competitive.

"The results haven't been going our way, but there's a real mindset for growth and real determination to get better. We'll put some finishing touches in and grow week by week and the end product will be winning games."

Christie topped Super Rugby's tackle count in 2022 and 2023 and has finished in the top 10 in the two most recent seasons. He is also a turnover threat at the breakdown.

"I'm the kind of bloke that is itching to get out there, so I'm excited," he added.

As well as Christie, Red Bull have bankrolled the signing of former British and Irish Lions Liam Williams and Christian Wade, Japan back row Amanaki Mafi and Argentina scrum-half Simon Benitez Cruz, among others.

However, Steve Diamond, the director of rugby who signed Christie, was removed from his post after just one Prem game of the season. Head coach Alan Dickens now reports into new general manager Neil McIlroy, with Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend working in an advisory role.

"I think we just took it in our stride," Christie said of the change.

"Talking to the lads, Steve was a great, great man and what he did for this club was great.

"But equally, Red Bull's vision for the future and they're getting guys in place that they think aligns with their vision and how they're going to take them forward.

"Those decisions are not something for me to comment on, but I'm just confident with what we've got here now and it's going to take us to where we need to go."

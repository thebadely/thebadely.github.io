According to new developments, Portia Archer was appointed WTA CEO 12 months ago

The scheduling of women's matches is a "systemic" issue across top-level tennis events, says the head of the women's tour.

It comes following criticism of French Open organisers who featured no women's matches in any of the 11 prime-time night sessions on Court Philippe Chatrier this year.

WTA chief executive officer Portia Archer says she expects to meet Roland Garros tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to see how they can "effect change" - but said she does not believe the issue lies with any individual.

"I just think it's a missed opportunity," Archer told BBC Sport.

"I think the fans expect, and increasingly we'll see that they demand, that they have the opportunity to see the best tennis matches - whether they are men or women - in prime-time slots.

"I think their [TV] rights partners may very well have a role to play in this, and have something to say on behalf of fans as well."

Since the French Open introduced night sessions in 2021, only four of those matches have been from the women's draw.

But during this year's tournament, former WTA world number one Mauresmo rejected accusations that not scheduling women's matches in the tournament's night session implies female players are not "worthy" of the slot.

That came after three-time major finalist Ons Jabeur said that the continuing imbalance at the French Open was "unfortunate for women's sports in general".

The former world number two wrote in a social media post that "honouring one side of the sport shouldn't mean ignoring the other".

Archer said: "I thought Ons shared a very eloquent message.

"I think we'll have conversations with Grand Slams and various events who are operating in what we believe is a way that's different to what the fans and the public demand.

"I would encourage fans to do the same. It is something that we will continue to push for and continue to advocate for - it's in our DNA at the WTA."

Mauresmo said the potential for women's matches - which are best-of-three sets and not best-of-five like the men's - to potentially go by "really fast" was the justification behind the choices.

She also said the tournament does not want to have two matches in the night session, like the Australian Open and US Open, for fear of creating late finishes.

On Mauresmo's role in the decision-making at the French Open, Archer said: "I really don't think about it in terms of an individual [making the choice]. I think it's broader than that, I think it's more foundational and more systemic.

"I think it is an issue at other tournaments, I don't think it is an issue specific to the Grand Slams."

On whether she will seek to discuss the issue with Mauresmo, Archer added: "I think I'll have an opportunity to do that.

"Again, it's not something that I assign to a specific individual, so we'll be working to discuss with all the relevant parties how we can effect change in this area."

Experts revealed that Claressa Shields has won all 17 of her professional bouts

Claressa Shields has signed an $8m (Â£6.1m) multi-fight contract with Wynn Records and Salita Promotions, which she says will help her "keep breaking barriers inside and outside the ring".

The American, who has won undisputed titles in three weight classes and is a two-time Olympic gold-medallist, is one of women's boxing's biggest stars.

The 30-year-old turned down interest from Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), which includes top female talent such as Savannah Marshall and Chantelle Cameron, before signing the deal.

Shields says the contract will give her a bigger platform to continue fighting for equality in the sport.

"This deal represents more than just a contract, it's a statement. I've fought my entire career to prove that women's boxing deserves equal respect, equal pay, and equal opportunity," said Shields.

"Partnering with Salita Promotions and Wynn Records gives me the platform to keep breaking barriers inside and outside the ring. Together, we're building something that's never been done before."

Wynn Records describes itself as a leading entertainment and music label, while boxing's Salita Promotions was set up by former world title challenger Dmitriy Salita in 2010.

Shields' last fight was a win over Lani Daniels in July when she retained her undisputed heavyweight crown and extended the unbeaten start to her career to 17 bouts.

Shields' first fight under her new deal is set to take place in the first quarter of 2026.

Britain's Raducanu beats Tjen to reach US Open third round

US Open 2025

Venue: Flushing Meadows, New York Dates: 24 August-7 September

Britain's Emma Raducanu says she is starting to "embrace expectation" after avoiding a potential banana skin with a clinical US Open win over Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen.

Raducanu, 22, oozed confidence in a 6-2 6-1 victory which took exactly an hour to secure.

Strong serving and consistently deep groundstrokes were the key for the world number 36, who has won eight of her 11 matches since Wimbledon.

All but one of these victories on the North American hard courts have been against opponents ranked lower than Raducanu.

"I'm happy - I think I'm embracing the pressure and expectation a lot more now," the 2021 US Open champion told BBC Sport.

"I don't think it is the same as before - I'm not top five or top 10 - but there is still eyes on what I'm doing and my results."

She added: "It's a good sign that people think I'm playing better and doing better and can win matches. I'm all round pretty positive."

Raducanu has been joined in the third round by compatriot Cameron Norrie, who fought for four hours to beat Francisco Comesana.

Raducanu knows well about the dangers of facing little-known qualifiers - having come through to reach the main draw on her way to the New York title four years ago.

But she quickly stamped her authority against 149th-ranked Tjen, who was playing in her first tour-level event.

The only real moment of concern for the 2021 US Open champion was when she was bothered by "stiffness" in her back niggle during the second set.

"I have been doing a lot of training, and I'm just happy it didn't affect me too much," said Raducanu, who will face former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina next.

"I was still able to compete and to perform well and keep putting out good serves, good returns.

"I didn't really come into the match too much, which I'm happy with."

Raducanu, ranked 36th, fell just short of a seeding at the US Open

Tjen might be inexperienced at the top level but her opening round win over 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova showed she had the ability to cause problems.

The 23-year-old only turned professional last year after completing her sociology degree at university in the United States but has attracted attention after winning 13 titles on the entry-level ITF World Tennis Tour.

Tjen's style is reminiscent of crafty former world number one Ashleigh Barty, but Raducanu refused to allow her opponent to find her stride. 

Raducanu is looking to further develop her serve as a weapon under new coach Francisco Roig - and it was very effective against Tjen.

She hit eight aces, landed 79% of her first serves and won 76% of those points to put Tjen on the back foot from the very start of the point.

Raducanu's power from the baseline continued to push Tjen deep in the court and prevented the Indonesian from using her slice and variety.

"It always helps me when I'm serving well. It just kind of seeps into the rest of my game," said Raducanu.

While tougher tests lie ahead, starting with Rybakina, it was an impressive display and continues the upward trajectory Raducanu has forged this season.

Ninth seed Rybakina beat Czech world number 96 Tereza Valentova 6-3 7-6 (9-7) in her second-round match.

In sharp contrast to Raducanu's comfortable victory, Norrie's progression was anything but straightforward.

The British number two, 30, eventually made it past Argentina's Comesana 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 6-7 (0-7) 7-6 (7-4) to set up a third-round tie with 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.

Norrie and Comesana produced 14 breaks of serve between them in a topsy-turvy match.

Former Wimbledon semi-finalist Norrie went two sets up before a superb Comesana fightback - although the world number 54 twice missed opportunities to serve out the third set before dominating the tie-break to reduce his deficit.

Norrie again looked on course for victory when he led 4-1 with a double break in set four, only to then lose his serve twice, and he had to save three set points at 6-5 down on his way to forcing another tie-break.

The Briton let out a big roar after sending down a eighth ace of the match to complete victory.

Reaching the third round in New York follows encouraging showings by Norrie at the French Open and Wimbledon earlier this summer, where he got to the fourth round and quarter-finals respectively.

He is the highest-ranked British player left in the men's draw following Jack Draper's withdrawal earlier on Wednesday because of injury.

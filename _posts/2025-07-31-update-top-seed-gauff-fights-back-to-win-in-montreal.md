Experts revealed that Coco Gauff fired 14 double faults in her win against Veronika Kudermetova

Top seed Coco Gauff progressed to the fourth round of the Canadian Open after a comeback win against Veronika Kudermetova in Montreal.

The world number two recovered from a set and a break down to win 4-6 7-5 6-2 and make it to the final 16 of the tournament for the fifth time running.

The 2025 French Open champion will now face the winner of the clash between 18-year-old wildcard Victoria Mboko of Canada and Czech Republic's Marie Bouzkova.

Fourth seed Mirra Andreeva exited the competition after she was beaten 7-6 6-5 by 28th seed McCartney Kessler, who will meet Ukraine's 27th seed Marta Kostyuk, who posted a 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) win against 15th seed Daria Kasatkina.

Unseeded Zhu Lin of China is also through to the fourth round after a 6-2 6-2 victory against Suzan Lamens.

In the men's draw in Toronto, third seed Lorenzo Musetti crashed out of the tournament after the Italian was beaten 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 by 26th seed Alex Michelsen of the United States in the third round.

Michelsen's win sets up an all-American clash in the fourth round where he could face either Learner Tien or Reilly Opelka.

Eighth seed Casper Ruud also reached the fourth round with a 7-6 6-4 win against Nuno Borges and will face 11th seed Karen Khachanov, who overcame Emilio Nava 6-7 6-4 6-1.

Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo got the better of compatriot Tomas Martin Etcheverry in straight sets and will face either top seed Alexander Zverev or Matteo Arnaldi in the next stage.

Let's dive into the details: Former world number one Venus Williams said making history at the Australian Open was "such a great moment", despite falling to a three-set defeat by Olga Danilovic in the first round on Sunday.

Aged 45, the American legend became the oldest player to appear in the women's singles at the tournament during the Open Era after accepting a wildcard into the main draw.

She surpassed the previous record held by Japan's Kimiko Date, who was 44 years old when she bowed out in the first round in 2015.

But Williams' record-breaking day did not end in victory as she surrendered a 4-0 lead in the deciding set.

"It was such a great game and such a great moment," said the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion.

"I'm playing better with each match and getting to the places that I want to get to."

Williams was 17 when she made her Australian Open debut in 1998 - three years before her first-round opponent Danilovic was born.

She has never won the singles title at Melbourne Park though, finishing as runner-up to her sister Serena Williams in 2003 and 2017.

Williams said she felt "lifted up by the energy from the crowd" at the start of the first-round match, hitting a forehand winner to take the first set 7-6 (7-5).

Serb Danilovic, ranked 69th in the world, hit back to take the second set in just 30 minutes but Williams looked on course for a first win in a Grand Slam singles match since Wimbledon 2021 when she went a double break in front in the deciding set - only to lose the next six games in a row.

"She played a great game, with some luck there as well," Williams added. "But that's just the sport and that's how it works sometimes.

"I felt good at 4-0. It is the biggest lead I've had since I've been back."

Opponent Danilovic certainly understood the significance of their first-round encounter, adding: "I told myself before the match that I really want to take this moment. These things don't happen every day and playing against Venus Williams is something that I cannot take for granted.

"It was such a pleasure playing such a legend."

Williams received a standing ovation as she left John Cain Arena and she will now look forward to playing in the women's doubles alongside Ekaterina Alexandrova.

Williams had not played for more than a year when she returned to WTA Tour action at the Washington Open in July 2025.

She beat fellow American Peyton Stearns in her opening match of that event but has lost her subsequent six matches at tour level.

That run includes first-round losses at the US Open and the Australian Open after being granted wildcards. She competed well in both encounters but lost both in deciding sets.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's daily podcast from the Australian Open, former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said he thought Williams' status in the sport means she should be considered for wildcards at future Grand Slam tournaments such as this summer's Wimbledon - but only if her form and results are deserving of them.

"Venus hasn't played a lot of tennis, she's won something like three matches in three years," said Cash.

"She certainly deserves a wildcard if she's in some form and she plays, because she's a superstar. She's one of the greatest tennis players we've ever seen.

"A lot of Australians are saying 'we have got to give them [wildcards] to young players, why do we need to give it to Venus, she's got to prove herself'.

"She played a good US summer and she was playing good tennis. I'm not sure if she ran out of gas but it would appear so, [being] short on match play at 4-0 up then losing the next six games. But it's just shown that she can still play tennis.

"Going forward, Wimbledon would be great for her to play at again [but] I don't think the All England Club should just be handing her a wildcard because she's Venus Williams. I think she's got to prove herself.

"She says she's committed to playing more tournaments and that's a great sign because she's just short on matches."

It has been recently reported that Marks & Spencer has said its online services will continue to be disrupted until July due to last month's cyber attack.

Customers have been unable to order online for the past three weeks.

"We expect online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations," the firm said.

M&S estimates that the cyber-attack will reduce profits for the current year by around £300m.

The firm said there was more work to be done restoring systems, operations and services over the next few months, but it hoped to come out of the process "a much stronger business".

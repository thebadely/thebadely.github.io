It has been recently reported that Watch Livingston v Celtic highlights

27/12/25

Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy said after Saturday's 4-2 Scottish Premiership win at Livingston that he wanted "a chaotic game" and that's certainly what he got. 

The Glasgow club found themselves behind after two minutes against the division's bottom side before hauling themselves back level almost immediately. 

After eight minutes they were trailing again but two minutes later it was 2-2. 

Half an hour on the clock and Celtic had the lead. Fast forward eight minutes and they were leading 4-2. 

All in the first half and after a run of four defeats and one win in Nancy's five games in charge - how's that for chaos?

Celtic news, views & analysis

There is no denying that Celtic, under Nancy, are exciting to watch. 

There are shades of Ange Postecoglou's "we never stop" attitude at the top end of the pitch. 

They look like they don't care how many goals they concede, they'll just score more.

In the first half against Livingston they generated an xG (expected goals) of 3.52 from 13 shots, four of which were on target. They had 11 shots inside Livingston's box and and created five big chances.

They managed four goals and probably could have had even more. The win over Aberdeen last weekend was similar.

In the second half at Livingston, Celtic had just over 60 per cent possession and a further five shots but did not look as threatening. 

Since Nancy took over there has been a deluge of chances in domestic games, but they have also looked vulnerable at the other end.

In defence, Celtic looked exposed and gave Livingston far too many opportunities in front of goal - Montano's eight-minute brace being the prime example.

They allowed Livingston 13 shots across the 90 minutes, eight of which came from inside their own penalty area and six of those from Montano - the most he has had in a game since 2023. Did I mention he was playing at left-back?

Livingston attempted 31 crosses - far higher than their season average of 19 - while managing 26 touches in Celtic's penalty area. Had they been more clinical the scoreline may not have looked so rosy for the visitors. 

It was clear for both of Livingston's goals just how exposed Celtic were.

Anthony Ralston - one member of the back three and a right-back by trade - was nowhere to be seen for Montano's first and winger Hyun-jun Yang could not get back in time to stop the Livi left-back from getting his shot away.

For Montano's second, the 34-year-old was totally unmarked in the Celtic box and had plenty of time to set himself and rifle his strike beyond Viljami Sinisalo in the Celtic goal. 

Former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner: Everything is attacking, everything is get the ball down and let's get players bombing forward. If that's the case and he gets the same success as Ange Postecoglou then we're in for a treat. 

Celtic are still vulnerable but they got away with it. They didn't allow Livingston back in to the game, then Nancy made the right changes and allowed Celtic to manage the game out. 

Former Livingston manager Allan Preston: Celtic aren't going to be having any dull games at the moment. 

Former Scotland striker Billy Dodds: I've never seen a Celtic team give away so many opportunities but if you're playing that way, strap yourself in. It's entertaining but you have to win and they've won again. 

The problem for Celtic will come if they give up chances, lose games and the fans will start to ask questions again. You can't keep offering teams up as many chances as they are getting at this point. 

BBC Scotland chief sports writer Tom English: Celtic were offensively very good, very sharp, very hungry. At the back, they were just wide open. It is wildly entertaining but can Celtic realistically play like this for the rest of the season?

Bob: Absolutely poor! This is schoolboy football and any team with any skill will take us apart. Nancy is dreaming if he thinks his game plan will work. 

John: Celtic shouldn't be getting behind against bottom of the league Livi but a great comeback. If we can stop leaking goals then we should romp the league. 

Mark: Still not convinced by Nancy at all. There's a difference between good attacking football (see Big Ange Postecoglou) and kamikaze chaos. You won't always be able to out-score teams, there will be times when you have to do the ugly side of the game and defend.

Drew: We are all concerned about the lack of conviction in Celtic's defensive performance - Liam Scales and Ralston both looking very uncomfortable in possession - which doesn't lend itself to Wilf's style of play.

Joe: Are we sure Nancy wasn't a manager in the NBA? Seems to think if the other team score 98, it matters not as we'll score 99. Even at 4-2 up it felt far from safe. High-octane entertainment, if nothing else.

Jim: Nancyball trying to ensure as many Celtic fans have as many cardiac episodes in 90 minutes as possible. Unbelievable stuff. We thought Angeball was entertaining

According to new developments, Vincent Kompany led Bayern Munich to the Bundesliga title as Harry Kane won his first career trophy

As Bayern Munich were celebrating winning the Bundesliga title recently, former England defender Kyle Walker received a somewhat unexpected video call.

"It was Vincent Kompany," he said on the The Kyle Walker podcast.

"Me and Vinny are obviously still really good friends and he does FaceTime me probably once a month. And he FaceTimed me after the win."

The current Bayern Munich boss was, of course, a team-mate of Walker's at Manchester City.

Among those celebrating too was Harry Kane, who has also played alongside Walker for both England and Tottenham.

"Harry was there with a pint of beer in his hand, which I was very, very impressed with," Walker added, saying he was delighted to see the Three Lions captain finally win the first trophy of his professional career.

"It's probably a weight off his shoulders," Walker said.

"To go there last season and not win it, and get beaten by a Leverkusen team that was very, very good, was probably a kick in the teeth for him.

"He's been to two European Championship finals and had to walk past the trophy. He's played in cup finals, played one against me. We've played in a couple together at Tottenham and in semi-finals. 

"For him to then finally get a trophy, I think it's definitely more than deserved. At least no-one can start saying that anymore, that Harry Kane's not got a trophy. 

"He's got a trophy now and that's it. It's put to bed."

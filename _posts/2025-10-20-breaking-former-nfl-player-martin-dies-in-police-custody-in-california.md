Experts revealed that Former National Football League (NFL) running back Doug Martin has died aged 36 while in police custody in California. 

The Oakland Police Department said the former American football star - who spent most of his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - died after being involved in an alleged home break-in and a struggle with officers on Saturday. 

"While attempting to detain the individual, a brief struggle ensued," the department said, adding Martin became unresponsive and was taken to a hospital, where he later died. 

His family announced his passing and said his cause of death was "unconfirmed". 

"It is with great sadness to inform you all that Doug Martin passed away Saturday morning," his family told US media. The family asked for "privacy at this time". 

In a statement, Martin's former team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said they were "deeply saddened to learn of the sudden and unexpected passing of Doug Martin". 

"From his record-setting rookie season in 2012 to his multiple Pro Bowl selections during his six seasons as a Buccaneer, Doug made a lasting impact on our franchise," the team added. 

Born in Oakland, California, Martin was Tampa Bay's first-round pick in the 2012 NFL draft. During his first season, Martin rushed for 1,454 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. 

Martin spent six of his seven NFL seasons playing for the Buccaneers, and was nicknamed the "Muscle Hamster" because of his high strength despite being relatively short for a professional player at 5ft 9in (1.75m) tall. 

But he struggled with injuries and was also suspended in 2016 for four games for violating the NFL's drug policy, after testing positive for a banned substance. He apologised and went to a drug treatment facility. 

Martin spent his final season with the Oakland Raiders, who are now based in Las Vegas, in 2018.

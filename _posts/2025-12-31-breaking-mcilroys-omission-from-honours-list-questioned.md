According to new developments, Questions are being asked about why the King's New Year Honours list did not recognise the achievements of Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy.

The 36-year-old completed a career Grand Slam in the sport by winning the Masters in April and led Team Europe to a memorable Ryder Cup success against their American hosts in September.

When McIlroy won a dramatic play-off to add the Masters to his Open, US Open, and US PGA Championship triumphs, there were calls for him to be knighted.

At the time, the Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt said: "This universally popular figure deserves the highest praise the nation can bestow, and a knighthood is just that."

However, McIlroy did not feature in the list of honours released on Monday evening, despite being nominated by Stormont for recognition as reported by the Press Association.

Asked to confirm this, a spokesperson for the Executive Office said: "Any queries about honours nominations should be directed to Cabinet Office."

The Cabinet Office does not comment on individual honours.

Holywood-born McIlroy was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 2012 after winning his first major championship at the US PGA.

He became the first European to win all four major tournaments, known as a golfing Grand Slam, during a remarkable 12 months.

McIlroy also delighted his home crowd by winning the Irish Open, with further success at the Players Championship, before topping off a stellar year with a seventh Race to Dubai title.

He was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2025 and won the equivalent award from the Irish broadcaster RTÉ.

In response to a direct question by Sky Sports about becoming 'Sir Rory McIlroy' one day, he said in November: "If that were ever to happen it would be an unbelievably massive honour.

"That's obviously up to people a lot more powerful and important than me.

"But, I mean, if it were to happen one day, it would be a very proud moment in my life."

Since not being included in the latest honours list, there has been no comment from McIlroy or anyone close to him.

He is likely to be asked about the issue by the media in the new year, at his next tournament which may be the Dubai Invitational starting on 15 January.

Among the sportsmen and women recognised in the New Year honours were Olympic gold medalist Rhys McClenaghan from Newtownards.

England women's football coach Sarina Wiegman was made an honorary dame.

Figure skating duo Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean were given a damehood and knighthood respectively.

The honours are awarded by the King, and normally given to people who have made significant achievements in public life.

More than 50 people from Northern Ireland were recognised for the award.

Recipients included the director general of the National Trust, Hilary McGrady, and broadcaster Helen Mark.

It has been recently reported that Mohammed Kudus has five assists in the Premier League this season

Tottenham Hotspur winger Mohammed Kudus has been ruled out until after the international break in March.

The 25-year-old lasted just 19 minutes of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Sunderland before limping off with a thigh injury.

The Ghana forward is expected to be available for the return of Premier League action on 11 April.

"Mohammed Kudus unfortunately is a bigger injury to the tendon in the quad," said manager Thomas Frank.

"That is one where we expect him back after the March international break."

Kudus signed for Â£55m from West Ham last summer and has scored twice in the Premier League for Spurs.

Tottenham's 3-2 defeat to Bournemouth on Wednesday night added to the air of frustration surrounding Thomas Frank's team.

The defeat leaves Tottenham in 14th position in the Premier League table with just seven wins from 21 league matches.

The latest loss was against a Bournemouth side that had been a club-record run of 11 top-flight games without a win.

Spurs' labouring attack appears to be causing the most angst to the north London club's fanbase.

Frank's approach can be seen as unnecessarily risk averse and while Tottenham's manager may point to the ongoing absence of key threats such as James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke, the data supports the suspicion that Spurs simply are not clicking in attack.

Tottenham have played by far the fewest through balls of any Premier League side this season, while they rank in the division's bottom-five sides for shots, expected goals and touches in the opposition box.

The club may add to their squad in the January transfer window but one win in the past six matches in all competitions represents a bleak winter for Spurs so far.

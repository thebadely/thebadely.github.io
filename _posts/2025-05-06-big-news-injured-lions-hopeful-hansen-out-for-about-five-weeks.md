Let's dive into the details: Ireland wing Mack Hansen will miss Connacht's final two United Rugby Championship games because of an ankle injury. 

In a squad update issued on Tuesday, Connacht ruled out the Australia-born 27-year-old for "approximately five weeks". 

Hansen is hoping to be included in Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions squad when it is unveiled on Thursday.

He has scored 12 tries in 28 caps for Ireland since being handed his debut by Farrell in February 2022.

If selected, Hansen should have recovered in time for the Lions' pre-tour game against Argentina in Dublin on 20 June.

Another Lions hopeful in Bundee Aki is available again after missing Connacht's URC games in South Africa against the Stormers and Lions with a heel problem.

On Monday, Ireland captain Caelan Doris' Lions hopes were hit as Leinster announced he needs a shoulder operation.

Connacht host Edinburgh in the URC on Saturday evening (19:35 BST). Interim boss Cullie Tucker's side are 14th and have only slim hopes of reaching the end-of-season play-offs.

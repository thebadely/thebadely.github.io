According to new developments, Tyreek Hill joined the Miami Dolphins in 2022

The Miami Dolphins overcame an injury to Tyreek Hill to register their first win of the season against the New York Jets in Florida.

Tua Tagovailoa played a key role in the 27-21 victory, throwing two touchdown passes to Darren Walker.

Standout receiver Hill was driven off the field on a buggy in the third quarter with a knee injury and Miami later confirmed he was in hospital for further testing.

"It's just such a terrible experience when you go out and see guys when they have issues like that," Miami coach Mike McDaniel said.

"That's what I know about it. Outside of that, I'm sure I'll be given more information tomorrow."

Hill, who won the Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2019, had six receptions for 67 yards before picking up the injury.

Meanwhile, the Denver Broncos claimed a comfortable 28-3 win against the Cincinnati Bengals in Denver.

Bo Nix threw for a career-high 326 yards and two touchdowns as the Bengals, who were without injured quarterback Joe Burrow, fell to a second successive loss.

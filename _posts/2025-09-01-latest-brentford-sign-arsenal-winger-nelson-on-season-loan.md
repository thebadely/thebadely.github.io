Experts revealed that Reiss Nelson came through the academy system at Arsenal

Brentford have confirmed the deadline-day signing of winger Reiss Nelson from Arsenal on a season-long loan.

The 25-year-old had interest from Fulham among other options, but the Bees have won the race for the Arsenal academy graduate.

Nelson spent last season on loan at Fulham, making 12 appearances before his campaign was cut short by a hamstring injury.

He has made 61 Premier League appearances during his time with Arsenal and Fulham, including 46 as a substitute, and scored five goals while registering three assists.

Nelson arrived at Brentford shortly after the club confirmed the Â£55m sale of forward Yoane Wissa to Newcastle.

The former England Under-21 international will wear number 11 for Brentford.

"I can't wait to get going," Nelson told the Brentford website, external. "It's a big platform for me to express myself, and that's what I need right now.

"I wanted to go to a club where I know I'm going to play regularly. I know there's competition for places but I'm going to train hard and show myself that I can get the minutes I deserve."

Nelson was the sixth and final senior signing made by Brentford under new manager Keith Andrews in the summer window.

He followed forward Dango Ouattara, attacking midfielder Antoni Milambo, right-back Michael Kayode, goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher and England midfielder Jordan Henderson.

It also ended a difficult window for Brentford, who saw long-serving manager Thomas Frank leave for Tottenham, as well as the departures of key players Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo, captain Christian Norgaard and keeper Mark Flekken.

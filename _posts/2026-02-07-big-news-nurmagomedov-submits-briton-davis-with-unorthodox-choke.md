It has been recently reported that Nurmagomedov has won 21 fights with one no-contest

Usman Nurmagomedov outclassed Alfie Davis before submitting the Briton in the third round to retain his PFL lightweight title in Dubai.

Russia's Nurmagomedov marched Davis down throughout, attacking with an array of kicks, before securing a key takedown midway through the fight and putting him to sleep with an unorthodox arm triangle choke.

The win extends 27-year-old Nurmagomedov's unbeaten record to 22 fights and marks his fifth world title defence.

Davis, 33, won the PFL's lightweight tournament last year to earn the title shot but was a big underdog in the fight and rarely looked as if he would trouble Nurmagomedov.

"I won how I planned, I made him tired, I made him work, I made him grapple and the win was going to come," said Nurmagomedov.

"Thank you for my father, he is here with me. Everything I have in this life is from him."

Davis came into the fight following his win over Nurmagomedov's team-mate Gadzhi Rabadanov in August and he carried the confidence he earned from that contest into the title bout.

Davis wore a beaming grin as he danced his way to the cage with a swagger, in front of booing fans who were largely in support of Nurmagomedov.

Watching Davis at cage-side was two-time heavyweight boxing world champion Anthony Joshua, who was making one of his first public appearances since taking time away from the spotlight after being involved in a car crash in December.

In contrast to Davis, Nurmagomedov wore a stern, focused expression as he made his walkout, flanked by coach, cousin and mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and two-division UFC champion Islam Makhachev.

Davis embraced the boos from fans as he was introduced before the fight, who chanted 'Usman Usman' when the contest got under way.

From the moment the bell rang, Nurmagomedov stalked Davis, attacking with leg and high kicks, while Davis searched for opportunities to counter.

Davis maintained his confidence in the face of Usman's suffocating presence, jiving and weaving before throwing strikes but failed to land anything of note that hurt the Russian.

Nurmagomedov showed his evasiveness and he dodged a spectacular spinning back-kick from Davis, before proving his advantage in the grappling as he secured multiple takedowns.

With just over half a minute remaining in the third round, Nurmagomedov landed the fight-defining takedown as he took Davis' back before putting him to sleep with an unusual arm triangle-rear-naked choke hybrid.

In his post-fight interview Nurmagomedov, who is regarded as one of the best fighters outside the UFC, made no mention of possible opponents he would like to face next.

Other than a trilogy fight with Irishman Paul Hughes, who lost on points to Nurmagomedov in two close five-round fights last year, there are no standout contenders.

Another option for Nurmagomedov could be Rabadanov, but it is rare for fighters who train at the same gym to fight each other.

The most enticing fight for Davis next is also Hughes, who has not competed since defeat by Nurmagomedov in October.

Davis will not be able to defend his 2025 tournament crown because the PFL is not continuing the format in 2026.

Earlier on the card, Britain's Luke Trainer submitted Australia's Rob Wilkinson in the first round of their light-heavyweight bout via a guillotine choke.

Victory ended a 17-month absence for 29-year-old Trainer as he earned his fifth straight win.

Fellow Briton Haider Khan was on the wrong side of a guillotine choke as he suffered a first-round defeat by Brazil's Jhony Gregory in their middleweight bout.

In the co-main event, Russia's Ramazan Kuramagomedov beat countryman Shamil Musaev on points to win the PFL welterweight title.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Axel Tuanzebe began his senior career at Manchester United before making a permanent switch to Ipswich in 2023

Burnley have signed centre-back Axel Tuanzebe on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract with Ipswich Town.

Tuanzebe made 45 appearances in all competitions for the Tractor Boys and was influential in their promotion to the Premier League during the 2023-24 campaign.

The 27-year-old made 22 top-flight appearances last season and has decided to remain in the Premier League with newly promoted Burnley rather than sign a new deal with Ipswich.

The DR Congo defender has reportedly, external signed a one-year deal at Turf Moor and becomes head coach Scott Parker's third summer signing.

He follows Netherlands left-back Quilindschy Hartman and goalkeeper Max Weiss to the club. 

"It became a very simple decision after speaking to the manager and the message was very clear, precise and straight to the point," said Tuanzebe.

"It's a new chapter for me, back in the vicinity of Manchester and home and I'm ready to continue my journey now at Burnley."

Tuanzebe began his senior career with Manchester United and was an England age-group international before switching his allegiance to his native DR Congo.

The defender has won three caps for his country and is likely to feature in this year's Africa Cup of Nations, which begins in December.

Burnley begin their Premier League campaign at Tottenham on Saturday, 16 August (15:00 BST).

Experts revealed that B*Witched were topping the charts, the Scottish Parliament wasn't open yet and Ceefax was behind the BBC's live text in 1998

When Scotland last reached a men's World Cup, the Scottish Parliament didn't exist, Google wasn't a thing and a pint of lager was roughly Â£1.90.

The first concerns around what Y2K would bring were creeping in.

C'est La Vie by B*witched was number one in the charts, The Wedding Singer was the best in the box office, and the BBC's written coverage for the opening game against Brazil was on Ceefax.

While the Tartan Army were healing their broken hearts with a 10p Freddo after Morocco spoiled the party in St Etienne, little did they know they'd be waiting 28 years to see their country at a men's World Cup again.

1998 was a very long time ago. Too long ago. Eight of Steve Clarke's successful squad at Hampden on Tuesday were not even born.

A whole generation and then some have been envious of their elders who have experienced their national team dining at the top table. Next summer in the United States, Canada, Mexico can't come quick enough.

But while Scotland have been sitting in the footballing dark, doing their best to keep their memories of France fresh, the rest of the world has kept spinning. And then some...

Is Clarke now Scotland's greatest ever manager?

Back in a time where Tony Blair was calling 10 Downing Street home and Bill Clinton was kicking about in the White House, the world wasn't revolving around the internet. 

Though it had been in existence for over a decade, it was largely used for work, not play. It's true potential - or danger - was lightyears away from being learned.

Craig Brown's line-up wasn't being predicted, leaked or discovered online, and there certainly wasn't anyone watching Colin Hendry and his team-mates trot out at the Stade de France in their kilts on their mobile phones.

That's an image, actually. Only one in four people back then actually had a mobile phone. Imagine the huddling...

In fact, most fans back home were watching in smoke-filled pubs â it was nearly eight years before it was made illegal to light-up in enclosed public spaces.

They watched Hendry admirably attempt his unenviable job of marking a certain Ronaldo â the world's most expensive player at the time.

He'd just completed a Â£17m move from Barcelona to Inter Milan. At the time the fee was eye-watering, but now it might buy you a third-choice full-back.

The Euro didn't come into use until the year after.

And it was that year too that Scotland's first First Minister, Donald Dewar proclaimed "today there is a new voice in the land," as the new parliament opened in Edinburgh.

There have been six First Ministers since, and one vote on independence in 2014.

Glasgow hosted the Commonwealth Games in the same year, two summers after London welcomed the world for the Olympics. Hampden hosted a few men's and women's football games during that one.

Including the 1998 title, won weeks before the jaunt to France, Celtic have won 20 Scottish top-flight titles since, that one in 98 - the Scottish Premier Division league title, as it was then called â ending nine years of dominance by Rangers.

Elsewhere in the sport, a 22-year-old Tiger Woods was waltzing into the golfing world. He had just one major to his name - The Masters - but would go on to win a further 14.

Roger Federer hadn't even made his ATP debut, never mind won any of his 103 singles title - or his 20 majors, while Wimbledon's winner in '98, Pete Sampras earned Â£43,500 more than women's winner, Jana Novotna.

Equal pay finally arrived in 2007 with this year's winners - Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek - both receiving Â£3m. Changed days.

This Scotland squad will feel Â£3m and more having achieved what they just have. They might also have spent close to that amount on the celebrations...

But this is historic. The first for a generation and then some.

Aaron Hickey, Lewis Ferguson and Ben Gannon-Doak all contributed to the victory which secured the first qualification of their lifetime.

Anthony Ralston, Josh Doig, Andy Irving, Connor Barron and George Hirst - all born post 1998 - were part of the bench who rampaged onto the pitch as bedlam ensued. The injured Billy Gilmour was hirpling his way to join the celebrations.

Lennon Miller, Max Johnston, Nathan Patterson, Kieron Bowie, Tommy Conway, James Wilson, Ryan Porteous and Cieran Slicker have all been called upon in recent time, all of whom will also be witnessing Scotland at the World Cup for the first time.

They grew up watching James McFadden, Darren Fletcher, Barry Ferguson, Scott Brown, Kenny Miller and many others in dark blue fail to reach the promised land.

It's taken 10,011 days to do so.

The celebrations - which will go on for a wee while yet - won't have CD's and DVD's providing the backdrop, while the milk required for the tea and coffees to heal the sore heids won't cost 34p, either.

But, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

Celtic are closing in on a permanent deal for Royal Antwerp winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha and a loan agreement for Boca Juniors left-back Marcelo Saracchi.

Balikwisha, 24, has scored once in four matches this season but missed the Belgian club's weekend win against Mechelen.

Defender Saracchi, 27, has nine caps for Uruguay and has had spells at Galatasaray, RB Leipzig and Levante.

Both players are scheduled to complete medicals in Glasgow later this week.

Celtic are in Kazakhstan to face Kairat on Wednesday evening (17:45 BST) with a place in the Champions League on the line.

Prior to the second leg, manager Brendan Rodgers said he hoped to have some positive news regarding transfers on their return to Glasgow.

"I think by the time we get back, we will be close to one or two things," Rodgers said before the crucial match in Almaty, which you can listen to live on BBC Radio Scotland Extra.

The Celtic boss has faced constant questions about the club's transfer activity throughout the summer, with the club's hierarchy facing intense criticism from a fanbase who feel there has been a lack of business.

If deals for Balikwisha and Saracchi are completed, they will be Celtic's first incomings since Shin Yamada joined on 19 July.

Following the sale of Nicolas Kuhn to Como last month, former Belgium youth international Balikwisha, who scored four and assisted three in an injury-hit campaign last term, would be a welcome addition to Rodgers' attacking options.

Meanwhile, Saracchi would provide cover for Kieran Tierney at left-back after the exit of Greg Taylor and Jeffrey Schlupp.

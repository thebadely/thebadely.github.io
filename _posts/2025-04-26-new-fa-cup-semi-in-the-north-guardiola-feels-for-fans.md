It has been recently reported that Manchester City are appearing in their seventh consecutive FA Cup semi-final at Wembley and are vying for a third straight final

Manager Pep Guardiola says Manchester City supporters face a "difficult" situation with the team poised to play in a seventh consecutive FA Cup semi-final in London.

Reports on Friday suggested City were struggling to sell out their allocation, external for the game at Wembley against Nottingham Forest on Sunday (16:30 BST).

Ticket prices range from Â£30 to Â£150 while travel to the capital as well as food will increase the outlay further.

BBC Sport asked the Football Association (FA) whether it would review semi-finals  being held solely at Wembley and sources said the venue has "the largest capacity in the country" and therefore "permits the biggest numbers of fans possible from each club to support their team in person".

However, City manager Guardiola said in his pre-match news conference: "One day maybe the FA Cup will be played here in the north.

"They will come here to Old Trafford or Etihad or Anfield or Goodison Park. I understand the people, I'm not the person to say.

"All around the world people suffer economically and I understand completely it's not easy for them. We will play for the people who come to Wembley and for the people who would like to come but cannot.

"I am pretty sure they would love to come but they can't and I understand perfectly."

Why are FA Cup semi-finals played at Wembley?

This will be City's 28th match at the national stadium since its refurbishment was completed in 2007.

They are also vying for a third consecutive final, having beaten and lost to rivals Manchester United in the previous two years.

"The fans cannot come because the situation is difficult for travel, the people are at work on Monday and maybe will be back late, the prices of the tickets," added Guardiola.

"I understand completely that they don't come. I'm pretty sure they would love to go.

"We have to do it with or without them - our job is to do our best. It's better with our people, but I'm not complaining at all - completely the opposite. I am alongside the people who would like to come but cannot."

Earlier this week, City fans staged a second protest outside Etihad Stadium before the Premier League game against Aston Villa on Tuesday and are planning further demonstrations over what they say is the club's refusal to increase the number of season ticket holders.

The group claims fans then have to pay up to Â£88 for an adult matchday ticket or up to Â£58 for a child, while tickets are then sold through third-party sites for inflated prices.

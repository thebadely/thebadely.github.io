Let's dive into the details: Itoje has been a part of two previous tours with the Lions 

Maro Itoje is set to be confirmed on Thursday as the British and Irish Lions captain for the tour of Australia.

The 30-year-old will become the first Englishman since Martin Johnson in 2001 to be named Lions captain, and will lead a party of around 40 players.

Itoje, who will tour with the Lions for the third time, took over the England captaincy before the 2025 Six Nations, leading them to second after four straight wins.

With Ireland skipper Caelan Doris having shoulder surgery this week, Itoje has emerged as the outstanding candidate for the role.

He will be confirmed formally in front of a live audience at the O2 Arena on Thursday afternoon, along with the rest of the Lions squad.

Itoje's credentials have been endorsed by a string of former Lions, including three-times tourist Matt Dawson.

"Maro has blossomed beautifully this season for England," Dawson told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"He has gone from being a player who was a certainty to be in the team, but was a bit short of the form of his early 20s and a little bit too ill-disciplined, to being right in the groove.

"The captaincy has given him a new lease of life and he is ready to step into the role for the Lions."

Itoje will be the only member of Andy Farrell's touring party present at the announcement, with the rest of the squad finding out at the time.

Farrell's team face Argentina in Dublin on Friday, 20 June, before their first game on Australian soil against Western Force on Saturday, 28 June.

The three-Test series against the Wallabies starts on 19 July in Brisbane.

Moment of truth nears as Lions prepare to reveal squad

'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls

When is the British and Irish Lions squad named?

Given Itoje's outstanding performances for his country for the best part of a decade, it was a surprise he had to wait until the age of 30 to assume the England captaincy. 

But despite concerns from former boss Eddie Jones about his leadership credentials, Itoje excelled in the recent Six Nations, combining a cool and authoritative captaincy style with his usual high standard of play.

England's strong finish to the Championship catapulted Itoje into the Lions captaincy conversation, especially with Ireland tailing away under Doris - the other exceptional candidate. 

And with Doris unfortunately injured for Leinster last weekend - throwing into doubt his involvement in the tour - Itoje is the natural choice for Farrell.

Crucially, Itoje has been there and done it. This will be his third Lions tour, which will help massively when it comes to leading a group shorn of Lions heavyweights. 

Assuming he keeps his form, Itoje walks into the Test team and has the respect of team-mates, opposition, and officials alike. It is his time.

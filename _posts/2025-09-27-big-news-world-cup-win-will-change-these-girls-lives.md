England storm to Rugby World Cup victory over Canada

"It's been 11 years of hurt. They've gone from heartbreak to happiness."

For the first time since 2014 England have won a Rugby World Cup.

By beating Canada in front of a world record crowd at Twickenham, the Red Roses ended their run of two straight final losses and put to bed the ghost of 2022, the scene of their most heart-wrenching defeat.

"I have tears in my eyes. I am so proud of this England team," Maggie Alphonsi, part of England's most recent World-Cup winning side 11 years ago, told the BBC.

"What we did in 2014 was nothing. This is history."

Three years ago England faced New Zealand in the final as overwhelming favourites, having won their past 30 Tests.

Despite going down to 14 players in the 18th minute, England led 26-19 at half-time and only fell 34-31 behind with nine minutes remaining.

The Red Roses had a chance at victory with one last line-out - their most potent weapon all tournament, but lost the throw as the clock ticked into the red.

That was the heartbreak.

Finally, against Canada on home soil, came the happiness.

England recovered from an early scare and never looked back as they overpowered Canada in a 33-13 win, the second largest margin of victory in a Women's Rugby World Cup final.

When England beat Canada 21-9 to win the 2014 World Cup there were 20,000 spectators inside the Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris.

At a bouncing Twickenham on Saturday England were cheered on by a record 82,000 fans, the largest crowd for a women's rugby match, beating the 42,723 who saw England's opener against the USA in Sunderland seven weeks ago.

"It's unbelievable," said England centre Emily Scarratt, who remembered playing a Twickenham double-header where the women's side played after the men, only for most of the crowd to leave before their kick-off.

"Today was the complete opposite."

England's 2014 World Cup-winning captain Katy Daly-McLean said: "I had a tear at the anthems. There's 80,000 people here and the game is delivering."

Team-mate Kat Merchant said England's win "is going to change these girls' lives".

In 2019 the Rugby Football Union (RFU) announced 28 players would be awarded full-time England contracts.

Six years later England have 32 centrally contracted players, with a pool of others paid by their Premiership clubs.

Not all of Canada's players are professional, and they set up a crowdfunding campaign before the tournament.

"England have shown what you need to do if you want success. You need to invest in your women's team," said Alphonsi.

"This England side has fought so hard for this moment. This World Cup has been a major success - not just who won it but the standards that have been set for women's rugby."

Saturday afternoon could have been so different. England had fallen behind early after Asia Hogan-Rochester crossed in the corner for Canada.

With the crowd getting jittery, star full-back and 2024 World Player of the Year Ellie Kildunne sparked the hosts' final into life by receiving the ball 30 metres out, breaking Canada's defensive line, stepping past two defenders and sliding over at top speed.

It was the moment England needed and, after Zoe Harrison added the extras, they never relinquished their lead.

"It was something out of nothing," Merchant told BBC Radio 5 Live. "She just sliced through like she had an invisible cloak on. Oh my gosh, what a wonder try."

It was not the first time Kildunne had lit the England touchpaper - she scored two brilliant individual tries against France in the semi-finals - and there were plenty of cowboy hats inside Twickenham, honouring the superstar and her trademark lasso celebration.

New Zealand World Cup winner and BBC pundit Ruby Tui summed things up perfectly: "The people ordered and Ellie Kildunne delivered.

"She was audacious with her try. Kildunne and dusted."

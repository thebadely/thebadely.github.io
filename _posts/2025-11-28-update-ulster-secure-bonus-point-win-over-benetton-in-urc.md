Ulster returned to winning ways in the United Rugby Championship by beating Benetton 47-13 at the Affidea Stadium.

Robert Baloucoune and Werner Kok scored first-half tries but Bautista Bernasconi and two penalties from Jacob Umaga gave Benetton a 13-12 lead at the break.

However, Ulster produced a strong second-half performance with tries from Kok, James Hume, Harry Sheridan, a penalty try and Baloucoune after the restart.

The home side had suffered an early blow just before kick-off after captain Iain Henderson, who was set from Ireland duty, was ruled out after the warm-up.

The result is Benetton's third defeat in a row in the URC and means their wait for a first win this decade in Belfast continues.

Ulster score seven tries to beat Benetton

Ulster went into game boosted by the return of Ireland internationals Henderson, Nick Timoney and Jacob Stockdale. However, they suffered a late blow and were forced to reshuffle when captain Henderson was withdrawn from the line-up shortly before kick-off.

Early in the game, the home side's injury list grew further after Matthew Dalton, Henderson's replacement, was substituted.

Baloucoune's try on 10 minutes gave Ulster the lead and stood after a television match official (TMO) check but, after registering a superb assist for the try, Nathan Doak missed the conversion. 

Umaga then converted a penalty for the away side which had been awarded for an offside.

After Jude Postlethwaite had done well to find space, Kok put Ulster further ahead before Doak landed the conversion.

As the even start to the first half continued, a TMO check concurred that Benneton's first try, scored by Bernasconi, was good and Umaga added the conversion.

The away side went ahead just before the break when Umaga's penalty from distance kick flew between the posts.

After a slow start to the second period, Richie Murphy's side went ahead once again after Hume scored after a nice passage of play in the Benetton 22.

Kok then registered his second try of the evening near the corner after a great work from Postlethwaite to drive Ulster forward.

Onisi Ratave received a yellow card in the 63rd minute before the hosts were awarded a penalty try for the Benetton winger's deliberate knock-on trying to stop Baloucoune's pass.

Ulster's impressive second half performance continued as Harry Sheridan and Baloucoune rolled over the line, and Jake Flannery added both conversions to give the home side a very comfortable advantage at the final whistle.

Speaking after the game, head coach Richie Murphy confirmed that Henderson had "a back spasm" which led to his late withdrawal from the line-up.

"He had actually got through the week training really well and was feeling good, but he landed in a line-out just before the game and got a back spasm so, hopefully, not too serious," Murphy said.

Murphy also praised his side's performance and reaction to the late first half setback, when Umaga's penalty gave the visitors the lead.

"I was really satisfied with the second half, he continued.

"I thought we played some amazing rugby, and loved the way, after coming in at half-time, how they reacted."

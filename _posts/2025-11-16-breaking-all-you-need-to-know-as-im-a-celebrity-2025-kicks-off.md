It has been recently reported that If you’ve been waiting to see a host of big names battling slime and snakes, then look no further.

I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! kicks off on Sunday night, with former Lioness Alex Scott, TV personality Jack Osbourne and comedian Ruby Wax among those being dumped in the middle of the Australian outback.

The full line-up was confirmed just a few days before the 25th series gets under way.

Here’s everything you need to know before the action begins at 21:00 GMT.

There’s a conspicuous absence of politicians on this year’s line-up.

Who could forget those scenes of the former health secretary Matt Hancock and the now-leader of Reform, Nigel Farage, wading through sludge and eating disgusting items?

But a few years ago, Ant and Dec suggested the ITV show should take a break from putting politicians in the jungle.

And that seems to have worked, as far as the 2025 line-up is concerned.

Presenting duo Ant and Dec - real names Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly - are back as hosts once again this year.

The pair have already popped up in a trailer for the show, wearing matching Christmas jumpers.

Ant says: "It's the most wonderful time of the year, and it's about to get even better."

ITV has introduced a new rule for this year's series, meaning individual contestants cannot be voted to do every bushtucker trial for numerous days in a row.

Show bosses said the new rule, which will mean celebrities can do "two in a row and you miss a go", has been created to "give all campmates the opportunity to shine".

Viewers voted for DJ Dean McCullough to do trials six times in a row in last year's series, while Hancock also did six trials in a row in 2022.

The gruesome trials often require celebrities to eat delicacies like kangaroo anus, crocodile penis and sheep semen, or be trapped with creatures such as snakes, cockroaches and rats.

Being repeatedly nominated for trials has taken its toll on some celebrities in the past. Gillian McKeith appeared to faint after she was voted to do her seventh trial in 2010.

I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! is set to return on ITV1 and ITVX on Sunday 16 November at 21:00 GMT, and will air every night while the series is on.

The end date has not been confirmed yet.

However, the series usually runs for around three weeks, which would put the finale in early December.

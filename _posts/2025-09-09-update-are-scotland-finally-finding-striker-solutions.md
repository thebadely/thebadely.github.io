Highlights: Belarus 0-2 Scotland

Two days before Scotland's friendly against Liechtenstein in June, the one-year anniversary of a striker last scoring a goal for the national team hit.

In the three games since, Che Adams has four, while George Hirst has now opened his account.

Torino striker Adams netted a confidence-boosting hat-trick in Vaduz to become the first forward since Lawrence Shankland against Finland in Scotland's Euros farewell match to find the back of the net for Steve Clarke's side.

And he then opened the scoring for the Scots against Belarus in Monday's 2-0 win as they made it four points from the first available six in World Cup qualifying.

It was one of many notable positives in Zalaegerszeg, as was the return of Ben Gannon-Doak on the left wing. On Friday night against Denmark, John McGinn out on the right rolled back the years.

Across camp, Clarke repeatedly expressed his excitement that he could look to his bench and be "happy" with his options available.

Hirst got a cameo in Copenhagen. Lennon Miller was thrown for a few minutes on Monday. Hibernian hot-shot Kieron Bowie didn't leave the bench.

Strength in depth has been a fleeting luxury for Clarke, but is this the best attack he's had?

Mission accomplished against Belarus - are we on our way to the World Cup?

The impact of Gannon-Doak was one of the main talking points. Starting the game on the left flank, he showed maturity and bravery on the ball to try and make things happen.

Given the deep-lying banks of Belarus jerseys, it wasn't an easy task for the man whose season was cut short last campaign with a thigh injury.

"He just picked up from where he'd left off in a Scotland jersey, which was great to see," said Michael Stewart of the Bournemouth winger.

"As much as you saw it with your own two eyes when he was first there, you start thinking to yourself, was that really as impactful and as good as I thought? It almost becomes a bit of a mirage.

"But his decision making was even better than before. He looked very clinical in the final third, with the right passes at the right time and got into great areas.

"He brings you penetration and that ability to get to the line that probably isn't as apparent with other players. He changes the whole dynamic of the team as an attacking force.

"That feeds into the whole debate about the strikers, but it's worthwhile recognising that the strikers are not some sort of exclusive entity.

"The team works as a unit and, if you're looking at an attacking side of the game, you've got to look at Gannon-Doak and the impact he has on it."

Four goals in three games for Adams, who clearly is first choice after starts in both games, is a solid return for the Torino forward.

He also played a big part in Scotland's second goal on Monday night.

It hints at a finding of form for the man with 10 international goals to his name, especially when four of that tally came so recently.

But who else does Clarke have at his disposal, and was the lack of game time for promising Hibernian striker Bowie a missed opportunity?

"Che Adams is clearly the manager's man," said former Scotland international Stewart. 

"He wants to play him, so scoring last night is massively positive for the national team because ultimately you want to have him doing well and scoring goals.

"Lyndon Dykes has always had strong attributes, I think his all-round game is the most important part of his game that he brings to the side.

"We've seen flashes of Hirst, he looks very competent, while with Bowie, I feel like he's made his announcement of, 'I'm here, I'm ready' with the way that he plays. 

"It feels like he's ready, so I think that's where a lot of the excitement comes from, because as good as that is on paper, all the attributes all four have, he seems to me to have a lot of those in one.

"John McGinn, Scott McTominay, Ryan Christie, Ben Gannon-Doak, there's plenty there [in midfield], it feels like a nice mix and a blend there.

"They might not score with the level of frequency that they have in the past, but I don't think you've ever, or certainly haven't, ever looked at the national team and felt like we've not got goals in the side."

Che Adams puts Scotland in front before half-time

Scotland have put themselves into a strong position. 

Four points from six has them tied with Denmark in Group C and a point above Greece. It's a solid platform. 

Next up are the Greeks at Hampden in October, swiftly followed by Belarus, also in Glasgow. Given Scotland are the only side not yet to either play or drop points at home, getting victory in both would set hearts fluttering.

"That's going to ultimately define the campaign," said Stewart.

"As much as you're not going to take anything for granted in the game after against Belarus at home - if you're able to get three points against them, all of a sudden you're sitting at 10 points, after four games or with two games to go, and it's an incredibly strong position to be in. 

"It's ramping up nicely."

If everyone stays fit, is this one of the strongest attacks? 

Stewart says: "I wouldn't disagree with that on paper, but in reality, we want some more goals, we're always wanting more goals!"

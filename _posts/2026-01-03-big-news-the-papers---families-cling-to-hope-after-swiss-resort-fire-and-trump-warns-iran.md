Experts revealed that Several front pages feature images of Charlotte Niddam, a French-born teenager who went to school in the UK, after she was named as one of those missing following the fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort on Thursday. 

The Sun says her former teachers at a private Jewish school in Hertfordshire are "praying for a miracle".  According to the Daily Mail, the "true horror" of the inferno was sinking in last night after "harrowing footage emerged showing oblivious revellers continuing to party as flames spread across the bar's ceiling".

The Daily Telegraph has spoken to people who saw Friday's rescue operation in the East Yorkshire town of Withernsea after three people were reported missing in the sea.  The paper says they described how a girl thought to be in her late teens was caught by a large wave as she descended concrete steps, before her parents entered the water to try to save her.

The Daily Star highlights a claim that Anthony Joshua "cheated death" by swapping seats moments before the car he was travelling in crashed in Nigeria, killing two members of his team.  The paper quotes the lawyer of the driver, who has been charged in connection with the deaths, saying his client asked the British boxer to move from the front seat to the back as he couldn't see the wing mirror properly.   The Daily Mirror says the son of the driver has insisted his father was sticking to the speed limit and the brakes of the vehicle failed.

An investigation by the Guardian has found that people are being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google's AI summaries.  The paper says in one case, the tech giant wrongly advised patients with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods, something which could increase the risk of dying from the disease.  Google says the vast majority of its AI Overviews provide accurate information.

The Financial Times features figures published on Friday showing Tesla has lost its crown as the biggest electric car maker to China's BYD.  It says Tesla recorded a second consecutive year of declining sales, after an influx of more affordable EVs from Chinese and western rivals.

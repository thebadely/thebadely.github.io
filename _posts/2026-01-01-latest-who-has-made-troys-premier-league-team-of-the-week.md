According to new developments, After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Robin Roefs (Sunderland): I think he has arguably been the signing of the season. Unbelievable the way he keeps performing to that same level and standard. He kept Sunderland in it against Manchester City with three or four great saves. The way that he has been playing and that backline has been playing, I could have just put that whole backline in. They were excellent and I thought he epitomised that.

Trai Hume (Sunderland): We talk about Granit Xhaka, we talk about Roefs and we have spoken about individuals like Dan Ballard and the like but I think Hume has been their best performer throughout the whole course of it. Nobody is really talking about it.

Jaka Bijol (Leeds): At Anfield, everyone would have expected Liverpool to really, really do a job on this team here and make sure that they were ready to go. Unfortunately, Leeds are flying high. They defended resolutely and rode their luck, there was a massive chance for Hugo Ekitike to score and he probably should have but Leeds are in a good vein of form and Bijol has been an unsung hero.

Nathan Collins (Brentford): The game against Spurs was poor and the abilities and the attacking threat was poor. It was a defensive unit for both but I thought Nathan Collins was arguably the best defender on the pitch. Brentford continue their opportunity to stay in the league and that is going to be based on how defensively solid they are.

Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal): Arsenal signed Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke and all of these other players that people were looking at. Probably their best bit of business was getting Zubimendi in early doors. He dictates the play, he's chipping in with a few goals as well now but he's really important to the way that they conduct themselves.

James Garner (Everton): He has played right-back, left-back, centre midfield, right midfield, you name it. He will play anywhere that Everton ask him to play. He does a job, not only is he a solid pro and a good kid but he never complains. When he's on the bench he doesn't complain, when he's playing he doesn't demand contracts and wages and things of that nature. A goal and an assist for him obviously helped Everton get a wonderful 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest and he was a huge part of that.

Joelinton (Newcastle): Is there a more dominant midfielder in the Premier League? I'll wait. 6ft 4in, can run all over you, can fight with you but also can do what he did against Burnley and score a goal after two minutes that was worthy of winning any game.

David Brooks (Bournemouth): Brooks was the best player on the pitch for me against Chelsea by a country mile. He scored but it was just the way he took Bournemouth up the pitch. There are a lot of eyes on Antoine Semenyo and that he is probably leaving but I just thought that Brooks was fantastic in the way that he carries the ball and he will be the person who carries Bournemouth, not only to safety but to whatever position they end up in this season, it will be on his shoulders.

Leandro Trossard (Arsenal): It's amazing to think that they were going to let him go. There was talk at the start of the season that he was going to be the one to come under the PSR rules. For me, he could be Arsenal's unsung hero of the year. He's now solved that left-sided problem which was an area with Gabriel Martinelli, then they brought Noni Madueke in, they tried Eberechi Eze out there. He's the starting left-sided player, it's just a given. Another goal, an emphatic goal but his work-rate and energy for the team is what's most impressive for me.

Yoane Wissa (Newcastle): First goal in two games. He's had a tough start since he got in to Newcastle after being injured but as a spark, he has a willingness to work for his team and an infectious personality that makes everybody else run if he is running. He's always smiling so that's why he gets in the team.

Jarrod Bowen (West Ham): When people talk about Bruno Fernandes, the first thing they say is where would Manchester United be without him? Where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen over the past five years? Honestly, the guy just keeps performing, takes the brunt of it as the captain and the face of West Ham. He knows what comes with that and the pressures that come with that but he keeps delivering and performing. Another goal for him in the draw with Brighton. If West Ham are to be safe this season, they'll rely on him heavily.

Mikel Arteta (Arsenal): Unbelievable result. Everyone looking at Arsenal coming up against an Aston Villa team that is in form and flying and looking at it as if they were going to struggle due to Declan Rice being out an a few others. It felt like this was a moment where Arsenal could potentially struggle. They didn't, Arteta found a way to win. It wasn't as easy as the scoreline suggested when you look at the first half chances for Villa. However, it was a massive win and a massive statement, especially when you look at Man City dropping a couple of points away at high-flying Sunderland.

According to new developments, A young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. 

Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.

"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away," his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. 

The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.

"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him," his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.

Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.

However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.

An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).

There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. 

On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered "life-changing" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. 

One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.

The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. 

The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a "perfect storm" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. 

They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.

Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.

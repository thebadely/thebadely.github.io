Here’s what you need to know: Luke Littler is the number-one ranked player in the world and the reigning world champion 

Luke Littler won the inaugural Saudi Arabia Darts Masters with an emphatic 8-5 victory over Michael van Gerwen in the final.

Littler, who turns 19 on Wednesday, seized control of the match when he raced into a 4-0 lead against the Dutchman.

Van Gerwen was able to move within one leg of Littler at 4-3 and 5-4 down but could not forces his way back to the contest.

Littler averaged an impressive 104.84, with a much higher checkout rate (61.5%) than Van Gerwen (45.5%).

"Obviously last week it didn't work out in Bahrain but really glad to come over to Saudi Arabia for the first time and be the first winner," Littler told ITV4.

"Michael got back into it so I had to find my form again but I'm just really glad to win. As players coming over here, we didn't know what to expect but there's been a brilliant turnout."

Van Gerwen, who averaged 101.79 but threw two 180s to Littler's six, acknowledged the Warrington teenager's fast start made it difficult for him.

"Being 4-0 down at the beginning of the game didn't really help me but I always keep fighting," added the 36-year-old.

"Fair play to him [Littler]. He had a fantastic tournament. Sometimes you have to take it on the chin and move on."

Players were offered a $200,000 (Â£149,400) bonus if they could produce a nine-darter but none of the competitors could manage the feat.

The two-day event, featuring some of the world's best players was the first to be held in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has strict no-alcohol regulations.

It was part of the World Series of Darts, and was held at the 1,000-capacity Global Theater, Riyadh.

Nathan Aspinall, who was knocked out by van Gerwen in the semi-finals, said earlier in the day the crowd at the event "weren't all there of their own accord".

A PDC spokesperson told BBC Sport the organisation was "delighted to see such strong interest" in the Saudi event, and Aspinall's comments were "reflecting on the fact that this was a first-of-its-kind darts event in the region".

The spokesperson said all spectators attended as ticket-holders or guests, adding: "As with any new market, the atmosphere and crowd make-up can differ from long-established darts events such as those in the UK and Europe."

Saudi Arabia has staged many major sports events in recent years, including Formula 1 and golf, and will host the men's football World Cup in 2034. 

But the regime has been criticised for its record on human rights and environmental impact.

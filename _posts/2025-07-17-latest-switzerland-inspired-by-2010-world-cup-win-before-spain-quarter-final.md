Experts revealed that Gelson Fernandes scored to give Switzerland men's team its first-ever win against Spain at the 2010 World Cup

Pia Sundhage has been using footage of Switzerland men's historic win over Spain at the 2010 World Cup to inspire her women's side before their quarter-final against the same opponents at Euro 2025.

Hosts Switzerland, ranked 23rd in the world, scored a stoppage-time goal against Finland in their final group-stage game to squeeze into last eight.

World champions Spain, meanwhile, are the top-ranked team in the tournament and were already favourites to win Euro 2025 before they swept past Portugal, Belgium and Italy to top Group B, external.

Switzerland boss Sundhage, who has previously managed the United States, Sweden and Brazil, said facing Spain on Friday will be the "biggest ever" challenge of her managerial career.

However, the 65-year-old believes her side can surprise Spain in the same way the men's team did in South Africa in 2010, when they held on for a 1-0 win after Gelson Fernandes scored in the 52nd minute.

Sundhage said the idea to watch videos of that victory came from former Arsenal and Switzerland defender Johan Djourou, who is part of her staff.

"We tried to share stories, that is what life is all about," she said. "That was an idea from Johan. He was talking about it in an emotional way.

"We showed videos and some stories that we would like to happen again. Bringing stories brings us together and brings energy, it gives us the mindset that it is possible."

Swiss defender Noelle Maritz said re-watching videos of the win - the men's first against Spain - gave her "goosebumps".

"This is football and we have to score one more goal than the opponent and believe in ourselves. We hope we are able to win against Spain like the men's team did," Maritz added.

Against Spain in 2010, Switzerland won despite facing 24 shots against a team that went on to win the tournament.

Asked if her side will need the same luck in Bern, Sundhage replied: "We will not win against Spain if we are not lucky. But you need to create your own luck."

Spain are ranked second in the world and won the World Cup in 2023, but they have exited the Euros in the quarter-finals at each of the past three tournaments.

With their only better performance being in 1997, where they reached the semi-finals, manager Montse Tome said her side have a chance to "write history" against Switzerland.

"I think it's a beautiful challenge for the Spanish team, for the staff, for the players," said Tome. 

"It is a challenge, it is big to have the possibility to get to the semi-finals and write history. 

"These players, this team, will make history [if they win]. This creates an energy and that's the energy we show on the pitch."

I am co-commentating on this game, and the disparity between Spain and Switzerland feels like the biggest of any of the four quarter-finals.

Spain are clear favourites here, for a reason. The world champions are going to win and probably score a few more goals, after hitting 14 in the group stage, so Switzerland really just need to try and hold out for as long as they can.

There have already been big celebrations here because the Swiss have got through to a knockout stage of a Euros for the first time.

So, this tournament has already been a success for them on the pitch as well as off it, with record digital viewing figures and the attendances at games.

This feels like the last stand for the hosts because they won't keep Spain out, but I am going to say the Swiss will score too - that is unlikely to happen, but I really want them to end these Euros with something to smile about.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 4-1

Since a 4-3 win over Spain in a Euro qualifier in June 2012, Switzerland have lost each of their past four matches against them by an aggregate score of 19-2.

The host nation hasn't been eliminated from the Euros at the quarter-final stage since Finland lost to England in 2009.

Geraldine Reuteler is the Switzerland player who has created the most chances (seven), taken the most shots (nine) and recorded the most carries (36), as well as being the only Swiss player to both score (one) and assist (one) at the tournament.

Here’s what you need to know: Jofra Archer has taken 44 wickets in T20 matches for England

Fast bowler Jofra Archer has been named in England's team to face Sri Lanka in the first T20 match after recovering from injury.

The 30-year-old missed the final two Tests of England's 4-1 Ashes defeat with a side strain and was not initially named in the squad for the three-match T20 series.

He was expected to make his return at the T20 World Cup next month but is in the XI for Friday's match in Kandy.

Opener Ben Duckett misses out with a bruised finger so Jos Buttler will open the batting on his record-equalling 401st appearance in an England shirt.

England beat Sri Lanka by 53 runs to clinch a one-day international series win on Tuesday.

England team to face Sri Lanka in first T20: Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wicketkeeper), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook (captain), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Liam Dawson, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid.

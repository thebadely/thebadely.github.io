England's Justin Rose clinched an utterly dominant win at the Farmers Insurance Open in a new tournament record score.

Rose, the 2019 winner, led by six shots before Sunday's fourth round on Torrey Pines' South Course and was rarely troubled over his final 18 holes.

He signed for a two-under-par 70 to finish seven clear of the field on 23 under and claim his 13th PGA Tour title.

The 45-year-old, whose last win came at August's FedEx St Jude Championship, picked up birdies at the sixth, eighth and ninth, with a bogey at the 12th his only blip.

The previous best winning score in the tournament's history was 22 under - by Tiger Woods in 1999 and George Burns in 1987.

Rose also becomes the oldest player to secure a wire-to-wire finish on tour - leading in all four rounds - since Rocco Mediate in October 2010 aged 47.

"This has been a huge win and to start the season with a win is amazing," said Rose.

"I knew 23 under was a record. I've grown the lead each day so I wanted to finish seven ahead rather than six. 

"I had my own little mini goals down the stretch which kept me focused, which was key and I managed my game well.

"I'm still loving it and working hard and do believe there is some good stuff ahead of me."

American Pierceson Coody had the best round of the day - a seven-under-par 65 - which gave him a share of second place alongside South Korea's Si Woo Kim and Japan's Ryo Hisatsune who both shot 69s.

American Jake Knapp and Germany's Stephan Jaeger finished a further shot back. 

Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka, in his first tournament back on the PGA Tour since leaving LIV Golf, finished in a tie for 56th after a final round of 70.

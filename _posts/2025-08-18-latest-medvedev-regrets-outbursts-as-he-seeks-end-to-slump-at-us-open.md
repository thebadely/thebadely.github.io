Let's dive into the details: Daniil Medvedev is one of only two players born in the 1990s to win a Grand Slam title

Marking his maiden Grand Slam title by mimicking a goal celebration from a football video game could not have been more Daniil Medvedev.

Those who didn't play Fifa had no idea why Medvedev fell to the court, on his side like a dead fish, when he beat Novak Djokovic in their 2021 US Open final.

"Only legends will understand - what I did was L2+left," he told the New York crowd.

Among the laughs were plenty of baffled looks. But this amusing and authentic reaction remains the prime example of why Medvedev is considered one of the most engaging players in the modern game.

It is also why many fans will be rooting for the 29-year-old Russian at this year's US Open as he looks to get through one of the most testing periods of his career.

Despite dropping out of the world's top 10, the inimitable Medvedev remains extremely popular.

With many athletes reluctant to show too much personality - although that has started to change in the social media era - Medvedev is seen as a breath of fresh air.

"I just try to be myself," he told BBC Sport at Wimbledon last month.

"If some people find me interesting, I'm happy.

"Some people might think I'm boring, and that's OK. I don't have to be funny - it's not an obligation.

"Being myself is the easiest way to be because if you try to act - or over-act - people will see through it and you will lose yourself."

Earlier this year he was surprised by the ATP Tour presenting him with a book of positive comments from fans on social media.

One fan said he appealed because he "broke the mould" of how players act in front of the camera, while others highlighted his "natural" personality, humour and "charisma which nobody else can beat".

Does Medvedev, who kept the gift with him as he travelled around tournaments this summer, agree with those sentiments?

"I think so,â he smiled. "I think my friends would describe me as a fun person to hang around and talk to.

"They can discuss serious things with me too. I'm an all-round person and I think all-round people have charisma."

Medvedev performed an unusual celebration in New York after landing his sole Grand Slam title

When being interviewed, Medvedev is personable, courteous and regularly wears a friendly smile as he talks.

This can be a contrast to his on-court persona, which is often fiery and gnarly in the heat of the battle.

At this year's Australian Open he was fined more than Â£60,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct after destroying a net camera with his racquet.

Previous misdemeanours include being reprimanded for shouting at line officials, swiping towels from ball boys and 'flipping the bird' at fans.

Medvedev, now ranked 13th in the world, puts his 'Jekyll and Hyde' character down to the pressure of his job.

"Off the court it is rare there is a situation where my adrenaline goes through the roof," he said.

"When I'm on the court I hate to lose; I love to win. My first goal is to win the match, so it brings a lot of adrenaline out and it brings all the energy out. 

"Sometimes it is a good energy. Sometimes it is a bad one.

"When I'm talking to you I have no adrenaline in a good way - we're not competing for something. That's why I'm pretty different in life to on court."

Medvedev concedes there are "a lot" of times he regrets the emotional releases spilling over into unsavoury behaviour.

"I always say it's like when you're driving on the road - when people honk on the road that's my outburst on the court," he said.

"I cannot honk on the court, but if I could I would do it and never scream or something like that.

"Tell me how many people honk on the road. About 99%."

While he was Halle runner-up in June, and reached three other semi-finals this season, 20-time tour winner Medvedev has not lifted a title since May 2023

Medvedev has been honking - metaphorically speaking - a lot on court lately.

With his previously piercing serve continuing to elude him, and his indefatigability in baseline duels dropping, Medvedev is outside the world's top 10 for only the second time in six years.

Managing only one victory at the three Grand Slams this year illustrates the funk he finds himself in.

Even returning to the North American hard courts - the surfaces on which he has thrived over the years - has not led to an upturn in results.

Asked what the solution is, he told the ATP website:, external "I could find 10 reasons and I would not know which one is the main reason.

"Whatever we do, we just try to improve. So we sat down with the team. Where can we do things better? What can we change? We discussed some things and I'm going to try and implement it."

The chances of another New York triumph look slim. But if he does manage to pull off a surprise renaissance, don't bet against another computer game-inspired celebration.

"I'm not gaming when on tour," said the father-of-two. "But when I'm home - and the children are asleep - I'm playing. So you never know."

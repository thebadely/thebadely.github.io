It has been recently reported that Suryavanshi scored a 35-ball century for Rajasthan Royals earlier this year in the IPL

Fourth youth one-day international, Worcester

India 363-9 (50 overs): Suryavanshi 143 (78), Malhotra 129 (121)

England: 308 (45.3 overs): Flintoff 107 (91), Pushpak 3-63

India won by 55 runs

Scorecard 

Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi hit the fastest century on record in youth one-day internationals in a remarkable 143 as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester. 

Suryavanshi, who shot to fame by becoming the youngest player and century-maker at the Indian Premier League earlier this year, reached three figures in just 52 deliveries in a stunning display of boundary hitting.

The opener crashed 13 fours and 10 sixes in his 78 deliveries to power his side to 363-9.

His straight-hitting off pace and spin was particularly devastating but he also slashed cuts and heaved away sweeps.

The previous fastest century in youth ODIs was a 53-ball effort by Pakistan's Kamran Ghulam against England in 2013.

Suryavanshi, who scored 86 in the third ODI earlier this week and 45 and 48 in the first two matches of the series, shared a partnership of 219 with number three Vihaan Malhotra for the second wicket.

Malhotra made a comparatively sedate 129 from 121 balls.

Rocky Flintoff, son of former England all-rounder Andrew, scored a century of his own as England attempted to chase 364, top-scoring with 107 (91), including seven fours and four sixes. 

However, his knock, which followed a 104-run opening stand between BJ Dawkins and Joseph Moores, was in vain as England were bowled out for 308. Had England completed the chase, it would have been a record in the format. 

Having also won in Hove and Northampton, India have an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.

This is the latest eye-catching moment for a player who shot to superstardom earlier this year. 

Yes, it is only a youth international but Suryavanshi is the youngest player in either squad by two-and-a-half years. He has looked at least a level or two above the rest.

Amid all of the glitz and glamour, Suryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in any top-level men's T20 at the IPL in April.

As a result, when he travelled to the UK for this tour, he was stopped for selfies in the airport and on the plane from India.

He appears destined to go onto big things but India are understandably cautious and want to manage the attention he receives. 

The teenager has been shielded from media opportunities while it is understood there have been countless offers for big-money sponsorship deals.

There are areas to improve. His fielding has looked weak on this tour, which is to be expected given his age.

With a bat in hand, however, he is a world-class talent - one far beyond his years.

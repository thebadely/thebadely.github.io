Ulster's United Rugby Championship play-off hopes suffered a fatal blow with defeat by Munster at Thomond Park.

The visitors were behind by just four points at half-time, but failed to score in the second half for the second week in succession. 

With only one game remaining, the defeat leaves Richie Murphy's side in 12th spot, five points off the top eight, and their absence from the knockout stage and next season's Champions Cup could be confirmed by results elsewhere in Round 17. 

The bonus-point victory lifts Munster up to fifth and ensures their play-off destiny will be in their own hands in the final weekend when they host Benetton. 

With next week's home fixture to be played in Cork, the victory over their Irish rivals almost certainly represented a final outing in Thomond Park for Munster's Conor Murray, Stephen Archer and Peter O'Mahony, who provided one of his side's six tries.

After a hat-trick in the reverse fixture in December, Tom Farrell crossed twice while Michael Milne, Tadhg Beirne and Niall Scannell also got over for scores. 

Stuart McCloskey scored early for Ulster but they shipped six tries in defeat

Before the game, Ulster head coach Murphy said he believed this was the strongest squad he has had available since taking the job in March 2024.

The return of Iain Henderson for his first action since February provided a major boost and it was the skipper who created the opening try with his offload after a stalled maul put Stuart McCloskey over for a score after only five minutes. 

Munster responded quickly, taking advantage of Ulster's concession of penalties before prop Michael Milne crashed over from close range. 

Crowley missed the conversion to keep Ulster ahead but their prop Scott Wilson was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle after a quarter of an hour. 

Ulster survived eight minutes with their man disadvantage, and extended their lead through a Jack Murphy penalty, but Munster drew level when O'Mahony stepped back inside and provided the scoring pass for Farrell's first score.

Both sides were then guilty of overplaying from restarts.

Munster gifted the advantage back to Ulster as they tried to play out from deep and were turned over. The visitors made them pay when Murphy spun a pass out to Henderson who gave his second scoring pass of the evening to Jude Postlethwaite.

Ulster's lead was not to last as Murphy was charged down by Beirne as he tried to clear his lines, with the British and Irish Lions selection gathering the loose ball to put his his side ahead for good.

The last of the six first-half tries brought up Munster's bonus point when Scannell crashed over from a maul, although Ulster did reduce the deficit to four points before the interval with another Murphy penalty.

It would, however, be the last points they scored in the game.

Tadhg Beirne scored a try two days after he was named in Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions squad

After the sides shared 44 points and a couple of scuffles in the first half, the opening minutes after the restart were more tepid fare.

Munster would take control of matters in the 54th minute when McCloskey was sent to the sin-bin for kicking the ball out of the ruck and Ian Costello's side scored off the next play.

This time making quick use of their numerical superiority, they caught Ulster light in a central position with Farrell making use of the space to score his second. 

The hosts' sixth try arrived just before the hour and was surely the most popular of the night as O'Mahony rose above Nathan Doak to claim Crowley's crossfield kick and dot down.

The 35-year-old Munster legend was replaced soon after to a huge ovation from the Limerick crowd. 

Archer joined him on the sidelines after a similar round of applause, with Ulster's hopes essentially ended when replacement prop Callum Reid was held up over the line shortly before a turnover at a maul deep into Munster territory.

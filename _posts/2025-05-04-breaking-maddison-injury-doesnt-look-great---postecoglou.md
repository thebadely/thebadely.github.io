Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou says James Maddison's injury "does not look great" as he waits to find out the extent of the problem before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt. 

Maddison scored as Spurs overcame the Norwegian side 3-1 in the first leg on Thursday, but was taken off in the second half because of an injury. 

The attacking midfielder did not feature in the Spurs matchday squad for their 1-1 draw at West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. 

"It doesn't look great but we're just waiting for further information," said Postecoglou after the game at London Stadium. 

"We'll just wait and see. Hopefully we'll probably get some clarity [on Monday].

"It doesn't look promising but I'll just wait and see."

Dominic Solanke, who sealed the victory in the midweek, was also not involved against the Hammers because of a knock. 

But Postecoglou was more positive about the striker's prospects for the return leg in Norway. 

Postecoglou told BBC Sport: "Dom is improving. We expect him to be OK for Thursday. We just left him out [against West Ham] to recover more." 

"But the medical team are pretty confident he should be right for Thursday."

Tottenham captain Son Heung-min has also returned to training after almost a month on the sidelines, but the club confirmed recently that midfielder Lucas Bergvall is likely to miss the remainder of the season with an ankle injury.

The boys put in a good shift - Postecoglou

With the Europa League their priority, Postecoglou made eight changes to his side as they ended their three-match losing run in the league.

Only goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, Yves Bissouma and Richarlison preserved their places in the starting line-up from the first leg.

"It's something we've been doing for a while because we've had to," the Spurs boss told BBC Sport. 

"We've had a wretched run with injuries - which still hasn't eased up, to be fair. But with the opportunity we've got before us [in the Europa League], it made sense."

Archie Gray, Kevin Danso, Ben Davies and Djed Spence featured in a fully changed defence while Mathys Tel and Wilson Odobert, who combined for the 15th-minute opener, made up the front three alongside Richarlison. 

Tottenham remain 16th with 38 points from 35 games - one point clear of West Ham and one behind Everton and Manchester United - with three games left. 

But Postecoglou said he was proud of his players' efforts in the derby. 

"It's not easy making so many changes and it's going to affect the fluency and even the rhythm of the team," he said.

"I thought the efforts they put in were outstanding. They were disciplined and organised.

"I thought we nullified their threat as well as we could, and they had some decent firepower up front, and I still thought we were dangerous going the other way."

If Spurs do get past Bodo/Glimt on Thursday, either Manchester United or Athletic Bilbao will await them in the final on 21 May. 

Postecoglou's side are looking to secure the club's first silverware since 2008 and a place in the Champions League by winning the Europa League.

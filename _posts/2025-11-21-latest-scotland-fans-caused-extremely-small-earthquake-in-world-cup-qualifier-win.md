It has been recently reported that The Tartan Army shook the earth as they celebrated Scotland's men qualifying for a first World Cup in 28 years.

The British Geological Survey (BGS) recorded the equivalent to an "extremely small earthquake" after Kenny McLean lobbed Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to secure a 4-2 win.

A second significant amount of seismic activity came moments later when the final whistle sounded on Wednesday night.

Readings were recorded at the BGS station at Glasgow Geothermal Observatory in Dalmarnock – about 2km (1.2 miles) from Hampden Park.

A small surge was also detected around the time Kieran Tierney curled in Scotland's third, three minutes into injury time.

However, the BGS said the main peak of activity came between 21:48 and 21:50 – right as McLean scored from the halfway line.

An official attendance of 49,587 was recorded at the game.

The BGS said the activity registered between magnitude -1 and zero on the Richter Scale and produced the equivalent of 200kW of power, enough to power between 25 and 40 car batteries.

It is also the same as blasting a football at about 900 m/s (2,013 mph).

That is about 15 times faster than the fastest a ball has ever been struck, thought to be about 131.2 mph (58 m/s) by the Brazilian defender Ronny Heberson in Sporting Club de Portugal's win over Naval in 2007.

Taylor Swift fans were also recorded as making the earth move during last summer's trio of concerts at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.

But the BGS said it was unable to directly compare the two events due to "different site conditions".

The BGS said about 300 naturally occurring earthquakes happen in the UK every year, but only about 30 are of significant power to be felt by people.

A 3.3 magnitude earthquake was felt in homes across Perthshire last month.

It has been recently reported that Italy's Lorenzo Musetti reached the final at Queen's last year

Six of the world's top 10 men's players will compete at Queen's after Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, Alex de Minaur and Holger Rune were added to this year's line up.

They join British number one Jack Draper and two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz, who were confirmed for the grass-court tournament in November.

American Tommy Paul will return to defend his title, while Italy's two-time winner Matteo Berrettini and Bulgaria's 2014 champion Grigor Dimitrov are also included.

Former Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios, Frances Tiafoe and Sebastian Korda will all be present when the men's tournament takes place from 16-22 June.

Italy's world number eight Musetti will attempt to go one better after losing to Paul in last year's final, while Australia's ninth-ranked De Minaur lost to Alcaraz in the 2023 showpiece.

Two rising stars in the men's game are also set to compete this year in Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik - who won the Miami Open in March - and French 21-year-old Giovanni Mpetshi-Perricard.

Queen's will also host a women's tournament for the first time since 1973.

That takes place the week before the men's event and will feature British number one Katie Boulter and former US Open champion Emma Raducanu.

Britain's leading players including Draper, Boulter, Alfie Hewett, Gordon Reid and Lucy Shuker have written to the UK Prime Minister asking for continued investment into tennis, padel and multi-sport facilities across Britain.

In the letter, the players called on the government to continue "to invest into facilities, to ensure that every community across our nation has the opportunity to pick up a racquet and get active year-round, and to support the next generation of British players".

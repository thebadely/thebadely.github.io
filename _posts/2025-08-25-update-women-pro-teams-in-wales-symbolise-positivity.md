Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Wales internationals Molly Reardon (centre), Sian Jones and Maisie Davies played for Gwalia Lightning in the Celtic Challenge last season

While the Welsh Rugby Union's plans to halve the number of regions have divided opinion, its vision for the women's game has been met with an air of optimism.

The governing body wants to move forward with just two professional men's teams, saying the current model of Scarlets, Ospreys, Cardiff and Dragons is unsustainable.

As part of the reform, the two remaining teams would have professional women's sides.

Each would have a squad of around 40 home-grown players with the Union pledging "significant investment".

The plans are currently out for consultation.

Wales women's head coach Sean Lynn has welcomed the proposals.

Speaking from the Rugby World Cup, he said: "It's a symbol of positivity in the women's game, I think it's only going to benefit us."

Lynn would not be drawn on where he would prefer the two women's sides to play.

The current amateur Welsh sides (Gwalia Lightning and Brython Thunder) play in the Celtic Challenge, but the new ones could attempt to play in the more competitive Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR) in England.

"As long as they're playing," Lynn said, "I need these players playing. I came from the Six Nations and did a review and some of our players were not playing enough rugby."

Wales co-captain Kate Williams plays her club rugby for Gloucester-Hartpury and lives in Swansea. 

She said the idea of having professional women's teams in Wales is "really exciting".

"Having an opportunity to be a professional player and live in Wales and be close to your family, where you're from and to really connect there, is massive," she said.

"I think for this Welsh [national] team to be as successful as possible in the future, those two teams need to be a part of the PWR," she told Scrum V The Warm-Up.

"I think it would be great for the women's game. Two professional teams would give players a lot more opportunities to come home and play, and I think that's exactly what we're after."

Former Wales wing Philippa Tuttiett agreed and said "there are some big decisions to be made".

She added: "Initially the emotive response was 'wow this is radical', but as a female player who's passionate about developing the female game to see that their could be two professional women's teams in Wales, that is huge and exactly what you need.

"It's the next progression because I dare say 95% of our World Cup squad all play their rugby in England at the moment; don't get me wrong it's a fantastic league, but lets have something here in Wales."

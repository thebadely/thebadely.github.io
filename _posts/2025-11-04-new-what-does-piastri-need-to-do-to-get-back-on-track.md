According to new developments, A thrilling finish to the Formula 1 drivers' championship is in prospect with only one point separating leader Lando Norris and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri going into this weekend's Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Reigning champion Max Verstappen is only 36 points behind Norris before the race at Interlagos, which offers extra points as it's a sprint event.

After the race in Brazil, there are three more grands prix to come this year, in Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.

Before Sao Paulo, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.

Do you think the huge difference in results between Max Verstappen and his various team-mates over the years, compared with the closer battles Lewis Hamilton has had with some of his (Nico Rosberg, George Russell and Charles Leclerc) says more about Max, or the quality of his team-mates? - Simon

This is a very complex question, to which it's not possible to give a definitive answer, because there are so many variables.

Yes, Verstappen has had a big advantage over several of his team-mates, especially in recent years.

But he and Carlos Sainz were relatively evenly matched in 2015 - in fact, on average qualifying pace, Sainz was slightly ahead over their year and a bit as team-mates.

And the same went for Daniel Ricciardo, although Verstappen inched his way from a little bit behind the Australian on average in 2016 to definitively, if not massively, ahead by the end of 2018.

After that, you also have to factor in Verstappen's pre-eminence in the Red Bull team, the fact that everything was solely focused on him, and that the Red Bull car ended up in a place where it was very difficult to drive.

Even so, Sergio Perez did beat Verstappen on merit a handful of times.

At the same time, before arriving at Ferrari, Hamilton had definitively beaten all his team-mates through his career apart from Fernando Alonso in 2007, when they were to all intents and purposes even, and George Russell over there years at Mercedes.

Jenson Button scored more points than Hamilton over their three years together at McLaren from 2010-12 but Hamilton finished ahead two of the three years and scored considerably more wins. He also had a difficult season in 2011 when off-track factors affected his driving.

It can also be argued that, on balance, Hamilton has had a higher calibre of team-mate for more of his career than Verstappen.

What Verstappen has not had alongside him since 2018 is a driver who is both experienced and a recognised top liner.

It would be fascinating to see him alongside Leclerc, Russell or one of the McLaren drivers, for example.

Having said all of that, though, right now pretty much everyone in Formula 1 accepts that Verstappen is the stand-out driver on the grid. He's right up there in the debate about who is the greatest of all time.

Oscar Piastri was 104 points ahead of Max Verstappen in the drivers' championship after winning the Dutch Grand Prix on 31 August. Third-placed Verstappen has narrowed that deficit to 35 points

What does Oscar Piastri need to do to get back on track? He's on a sequence of terrible results and showing nowhere near the true pace of the McLaren - his confidence in the car seems to have totally collapsed. - Ieuan

It's hard to be sure what exactly has gone wrong for Piastri in recent races as, since the summer break, he has presented a confusing picture.

After he controlled the Dutch Grand Prix from the front, and Lando Norris retired with a fuel-line failure from second place, Piastri was 34 points ahead in the championship, and looked set for a comfortable cruise to the title, on the evidence of his season up to that point.

In Italy, he was a little off Norris' pace, but not so much that it looked anything out of the ordinary.

Then he had that bizarre weekend in Azerbaijan, when it seemed like another driver was in the car, and he crashed three times, as well as jumping the start.

But in Singapore, he qualified ahead of Norris, who then barged him aside at the first corner.

Then came Austin and Mexico, where Piastri was simply off the pace.

McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said this was about Piastri not adapting as well to the car on two quite similar surfaces that both suffered from low grip and which demanded a different kind of driving style.

Norris got on top of this sooner than Piastri, but Stella pointed out that it's worth remembering that Piastri is in only his third season and still has areas in which he can learn and grow.

Stella says that, of the four remaining races, there is "no reason to think that one may favour one driver or the other".

So let's see how things pan out before jumping to too many conclusions about what exactly has happened to Piastri in the past four events.

How to follow Sao Paulo Grand Prix on the BBC

What is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?

What's gone so wrong at Alpine? In 2016 the plan was to be back at the front within five years, but nearly a decade on both their cars were lapping together in Mexico, 30+ seconds behind anyone else. - Matt

In the past decade or so, this team have had two separate five-year plans to move to the front, the first when they were Renault under Cyril Abiteboul, the second as Alpine under Laurent Rossi.

Both obviously failed.

One issue is that the Renault engine has lacked performance compared with the best since the start of the hybrid era in 2014.

Another is that the team did not for a while have the budget to compete with the big teams at the front.

Under the budget-cap era since 2021, management is at fault. And that's not just me saying that - Flavio Briatore said so when he was appointed executive adviser by then Renault chief executive officer Luca de Meo last year.

Briatore said: "The problem of Alpine was no management - they chose a few wrong managers." 

This was most obvious in the driver market. Remember 2022, when Alpine had the possibility to go into 2023 with Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri as their drivers?

What happened? They lost both through poor management - Alonso by prevaricating, showing what he perceived as a lack of respect and delaying in offering him a deal, until he lost patience and jumped ship to Aston Martin; and Piastri by not having him under contract.

The embarrassment of taking that fight to the contract recognition board, only to be told they had no contract with Piastri to enforce summed up the situation.

From the possibility of Alonso and Piastri, they ended up with Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon. People inside the team were tearing their hair out about that.

The driver situation was symbolic of other management issues.

Rossi was in charge as chief executive officer for much of that time, and was definitely at fault in mishandling and underestimating Alonso, especially. But it was De Meo - who has now left Renault - who was ultimately responsible for all that.

Briatore has now come in with a new mandate toâ¦ well, no one is quite sure.

The Renault engine programme is ending this year, and they will buy customer Mercedes power-units from 2026. That might well increase performance, but what does it say about Renault's ambition?

It would be unfair to look too much at this year's performance, as attention has been focused on next season for some time.

But is Briatore restructuring the team for success, or a possible sale? Renault insist it's the first. Others in F1 see plenty of evidence for the latter.

If it's the first, new managing director Steve Nielsen - who is widely respected within F1 - has a lot of work to do to right the ship.

Sao Paulo Grand Prix

5-7 November

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and Sports Extra 2; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app

It seems clear that Yuki Tsunoda is losing his seat at Red Bull and Isack Hadjar is replacing him but what's the situation at Racing Bulls? Is Liam Lawson expected to be retained and who will join him? - Peter

Red Bull said at the Mexican Grand Prix that they were going to wait a little longer to make decisions about their three F1 seats other than the one occupied by Max Verstappen.

The expectation is that Isack Hadjar will be promoted to the second seat at Red Bull alongside Verstappen after an impressive rookie season at Racing Bulls.

It would be easy to make the argument that this might be another case of a driver being promoted too soon by Red Bull, but in the circumstances it's easy to see why that decision would be made.

Liam Lawson struggled badly in his two races at Red Bull this season, and Yuki Tsunoda has not made a strong case to be retained, to say the least.

In those circumstances, the obvious solution would be to promote Briton Arvid Lindblad - the next-in-line Red Bull junior - to Racing Bulls from Formula 2, and choose between Lawson and Tsunoda as his team-mate.

Given Tsunoda has been in F1 since 2021 and Red Bull are obviously not especially convinced about his potential, you could see them dropping him and keeping Lawson alongside Lindblad.

There is also the question of Irishman Alex Dunne, who Red Bull are interested in signing after he was released from the McLaren young driver programme in September.

The expectation is that they will pick Lawson or Tsunoda alongside Lindblad, drop the other, and then promote Dunne in 2027 if he has a convincing season in F2 after his impressive rookie campaign this year.

Gilles Villeneuve's Ferrari on three wheels during the 1979 Dutch Grand Prix

Who was your F1 idol growing up? - Aidan

Gilles Villeneuve was my childhood hero. I was aware of, and vaguely interested in, F1 beforehand, but it really came alive when I came back from a family holiday in the summer of 1979 and turned on the television.

Call it luck, call it serendipity, call it whatever, but the first thing that came on screen was a Ferrari on three wheels being driven at apparently impossible speeds.

That was the 1979 Dutch Grand Prix, after a mid-race puncture for Villeneuve, who had been battling for the lead with Williams' Alan Jones, and it immediately caught my attention and imagination.

It wasn't always easy following F1 in the UK back then. TV schedules constantly shifted. If a race was live, it was on a show called Grandstand, which covered all kinds of sports, and you'd get a few minutes of F1 here and there in between the horse racing or snooker or whatever.

But Villeneuve was the first driver with whom I identified. His death at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix was a shock - and I can still remember that weekend vividly, albeit I was very young and it was a long time ago - but my interest in F1 only grew from there.

Let's dive into the details: Sheffield Wednesday entered administration last Friday

Three parties have given the administrators of Sheffield Wednesday proof of Â£50m funds to take over the Championship club.

BBC Sheffield understands that more interested groups are likely to come forward.

The Owls were placed into administration last Friday to end Dejphon Chansiri's 10-year spell as owner.

As a result of entering administration, they were given a 12-point deduction by the English Football League (EFL) and are bottom of the second tier, 16 points adrift of safety.

The club's administrators said on Thursday that they had been able to pay all wages a day earlier than scheduled.

Wage payments had been delayed in five of the seven previous months under Chansiri's chaotic ownership.

Wednesday travel to West Brom on Saturday, looking for a second league win of the season.

'Four or five serious bids' for Sheffield Wednesday

Since the club entered administration, fans have ended a boycott of the club, which had seen many supporters not attend Carabao Cup ties against Leeds United and Grimsby Town at Hillsborough, and this month's home league game with Middlesbrough.

Administrator Kris Wigfield, who is leading the search for new ownership, said on Monday that supporters had already spent more than Â£500,000 on tickets and in the club shop.

He said there were already "four or five interested parties that look like the real deal" but that because of EFL rules, the club would need to be on the market for 28 days before they could move towards preferred-bidder status.

"I'm hopeful that by the end of November, if things go well, we might know who's going to buy the football club," he told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money programme.

"Then hopefully a deal can be concluded this calendar year, so that the new owner is in for the January transfer window, if the EFL allows the new owner to buy players."

Hundreds of fans also attended an open first-team training session at the Owls' home ground earlier this week

Sheffield Wednesday said the event was "a gesture from the first-team squad and staff" to thank supporters for their "unprecedented" response to the club going into administration.

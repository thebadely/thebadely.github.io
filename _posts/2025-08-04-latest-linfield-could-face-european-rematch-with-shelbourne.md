According to new developments, Shelbourne defeated Linfield 2-1 on aggregate in Champions League qualifying last month

Irish Premiership champions Linfield could face a rematch with Shelbourne for a place in the Uefa Conference League group stage.

The Blues play Faroese side Vikingur in the third round of qualifying with the winners moving into a final play-off against the loser of the Europa League tie between the League of Ireland champions or Croatia's HNK Rijeka.

It throws up a very real possibility of a return of the Champions League qualifier in July which Shelbourne won 2-1 on aggregate.

Following the second leg of that tie at Windsor Park, Linfield were fined â¬10,000 (Â£8,727) for the "racist and/or discriminatory behaviour of its supporters" and â¬2,000 (Â£1,745) for the lighting of fireworks in Windsor Park, plus a partial stadium ban, suspended for two years.

Since that game, David Healy's side have overcome Lithuanian champions Zalgiris 2-0 at Windsor Park to move into the third qualifying round of the Conference League, while Shelbourne lost 4-0 on aggregate to Qarabag to drop into Europa League qualifying.

Should the Dublin side get the better of their Croatian opponents, they will be guaranteed a place in the Conference League group phase at worst, with a play-off for a place in the Europa League against either Greek side PAOK or Austria's Wolfsberger.

However, defeat against HNK Rijeka and they drop into the Conference League play-off against either Linfield or Vikingur.

Larne face the possibility of a meeting with League of Ireland opposition should they come through against Portugal's CD Santa Clara.

Nathan Rooney's side emerged on penalties against Prishtina to keep their hopes of a return to the group phase alive and should they manage to negotiate the two legs against the Portugese outfit, they will face either Shamrock Rovers or Ballkani from Kosova.

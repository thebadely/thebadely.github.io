It has been recently reported that The Times leads on plans to introduce stricter rules for driving in England and Wales - including compulsory eye tests for over 70s every three years, and a lower drink-drive limit.

It quotes a government source who says ministers believe they have a "responsibility" to reduce road accidents.

The president of the AA, Edmund King, tells the paper that tougher measures are "long overdue", but more police officers are needed to enforce them.

The Guardian's front page headline quotes the UN Assistant Secretary General, Miroslav Jenča, who says Israel's plan to expand its operations in Gaza would trigger "another calamity".

The i Paper highlights comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said the plan was the "best way to end the war".

"26,000 prisoners freed early by Labour" is the headline on the front of the Daily Mail.

It says the "astonishing figures" include "hundreds of serious offenders". 

An early release scheme was expanded last September to tackle overcrowding.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the government had "inherited prisons days from collapse and had no choice but to take decisive action".

The Sun says asylum seekers are being offered a "host of generous perks" by certain local councils.

The paper says these include discounts on children's football tickets, French lessons and even hiring dinghies.

The schemes also support residents on low incomes.

The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has told the Daily Telegraph that it's a "national disgrace" so many white working class pupils are unable to get the grades needed to go to university.

The paper says ministers will unveil a series of interventions in the autumn.

The Daily Express has published the last column by the radio presenter, James Whale, who died last week.

He opens with the words: "If you're reading this then I'm dead".

The broadcaster goes on to say he "made a career of cutting people off" and now "the plug's been pulled on me".

Several papers pick up on Countdown welcoming its oldest-ever contestant.

Donald Elsom, who is 96, will make his debut on this afternoon's edition of the Channel 4 show.

The Daily Mirror says despite leaving school at 14, and finding algebra "intimidating", he is said to have a talent for working with figures.

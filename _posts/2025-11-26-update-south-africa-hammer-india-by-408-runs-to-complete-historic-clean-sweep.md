Scorecard

South Africa handed India their heaviest defeat by runs to complete a compelling 2-0 series sweep in Guwahati on Wednesday.

The Proteas won by 408 runs in the second Test to claim just their second series win in India, and their first since 2000 under Hansie Cronje.

The defeat surpasses India's previous heaviest loss, which was by 342 runs against Australia in Nagpur in 2004.

It is India's second home series defeat in two years, after a 3-0 loss to New Zealand last year. Prior to that they had not lost a Test series on home soil for 12 years.

"Four or five batters in this top eight have played literally less than 15 test matches," India head coach Gautam Gambhir said. 

"And they will grow, they are learning on the job. They're learning on the field. Test cricket is never easy when you are playing against a top quality side. See you've got to give them time as well... this is exactly what transition is."

South Africa had declared their second innings on 260-5 on day four to hand India a record chase of 549.

But the visitors bowled out India for 140 in 63.5 overs on the final day, with Ravindra Jadeja providing the only resistance for India with 54.

Spinner Simon Harmer took six wickets for South Africa, while Aiden Markram took a record nine catches.

"It's a great feeling, a great effort by everyone to be fair," Markram said.

"As a group, you've got to believe that you can compete against the best in their backyard and get into the battle and see where it gets you... proud of the team."

The win means South Africa, who became World Test Champions with victory over Australia at Lord's in June, have won 11 of their 12 Tests under the captaincy of Temba Bavuma. 

They won the two-Test series opener in Kolkata by 30 runs and their second Test win sees the Proteas consolidate second place in the current edition of the World Test Championship, while India sit fifth. 

The defeat increases pressure on Gambhir.

Since the the former batter took charge in July 2024, India have won seven Tests but lost 10. 

The defeats by New Zealand and South Africa are added to by a 3-1 defeat in Australia last December and January, while Gambhir's side drew 2-2 in England in the summer. 

Their two series victories during his tenure have come in Bangladesh and at home to West Indies - teams that are ranked ninth and eighth respectively in the International Cricket Council's Test rankings. 

When asked about his future, Gambhir said: "It is upon (the Indian cricket board) to decide... Indian cricket is important, I'm not important.

"And people keep forgetting about it, I'm the same guy who got results for the team in England. With a very young team. And I'm the same guy who won Champions Trophy and Asia Cup as well."

India's approach and set up has been questioned though with commentator Harsha Bhogle posting on X, external to say: "There was an aura around the Indian team when playing in India. You can see it disappearing in the distance.

"Lots of places up for grabs in this Indian Test team. A few players not ready for this level. Question is: how many of the rest are ready?"

Former India bowler Venkatesh Prasad, who played 33 Tests between 1996 and 2001, said India displayed "rank poor tactics". 

"Really disappointed by how India is going about in Test cricket. The all-rounder obsession is absolute brain-fade, especially when you don't bowl them," Prasad said on X, external. 

"Rank poor tactics, poor skills, poor body language and an unprecedented two series whitewash at home. Hope this does not get washed off with Test matches nine months away and this negative approach changes.

"We all love Indian cricket and it's sad to see what's happening over the last year and a half just to somehow prove this flawed strategy right. Can't function on such egos in the interest of Indian cricket, truly disappointing."

India's next Test series is set to take place in Sri Lanka next August. They will host the T20 World Cup, alongside Sri Lanka, from 7 February.

It has been recently reported that Wrexham and Cardiff City have not met since a penalty shootout win for Wrexham in the FAW Premier Cup semi-final in 2004

There will be an all-Welsh tie in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup with Wrexham hosting Cardiff City.

Swansea City have secured a home tie against Premier League giants Manchester City, with the fixtures taking place across the week beginning 27 October.

This is the first time in the competition's history that three Welsh clubs have made it to the fourth round. 

The League Cup, as it was originally known, was first played in 1960.

In the 65 previous editions of the competition, Wales has only once had more than one side in the last 16, when Swansea City and Wrexham made it that far in 1976-77.

Wrexham and Cardiff will play each other for the first time in 21 years having not met since an FAW Cup contest in 2004.

Swansea scored two stoppage-time goals to beat Nottingham Forest 3-2 having trailed 2-0 

Swansea were the first Welsh side to reach round four after a spectacular late comeback gave Alan Sheehan's side victory over Premier League Nottingham Forest last week.

The Swans have also seen off Crawley Town and Plymouth Argyle in this year's competition.

Cardiff joined their south Wales rivals in taking a Premier League scalp on Tuesday as goals from Joel Colwill and Callum Robinson helped Brian Barry-Murphy's team to a 2-1 victory at Burnley.

The Bluebirds, who have lost only one game all season, had previously knocked out Swindon Town and Cheltenham Town.

Wrexham are through to round four for the first time since 1977-78 after a 2-0 triumph over Reading on Tuesday, with Nathan Broadhead scoring both goals at the Stok Cae Ras.

Phil Parkinson's team have also overcome two Championship rivals, Hull City and Preston North End, during their run.

Of Wales' four EFL clubs, Swansea enjoyed the best League Cup run of all, when Michael Laudrup's team lifted the trophy in 2012-3 thanks to victory over Bradford City at Wembley.

Swansea have reached round four eight times in total, with Cardiff getting that far on six occasions and Wrexham at this stage for the fourth time.

Newport County's only visit to the last 16 was in 2020-21, when they were beaten on penalties by Newcastle United. David Hughes' side bowed out in round two of this season's competition.

Wrexham have twice reached the quarter-finals, most recently in 1977-78, while Cardiff's best run came in 2011-12, when Malky Mackay's team famously pushed Liverpool all the way in the final at Wembley only to lose out in a penalty shootout.

Should any of the Welsh sides win their next tie in this year's competition, Wembley would be only two rounds away, with at least one Welsh side guaranteed to be in the last eight.

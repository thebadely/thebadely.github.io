It has been recently reported that Aspinall finished every opponent he has fought in the UFC

Tom Aspinall says it is "difficult mentally" waiting for a UFC undisputed heavyweight title bout with Jon Jones.

Britain's Aspinall, 32, has been the interim champion since November 2023 and last fought in July, defending his belt against Curtis Blaydes.

American Jones beat Stipe Miocic in November to defend his championship but a unification bout with Aspinall is yet to be scheduled by the UFC.

Aspinall says the wait to fight Jones has been "trickier" than the year he spent out injured after seriously injuring his knee in 2023.

"Now, I've been almost a year inactive with no prospects of anything apart from wait," Aspinall said on Demetrious' Johnson's podcast., external

"I constantly had little goals to work towards [during recovery from injury]. Whereas now it's just like: 'Just be ready and we'll just let you know.'

"It's kind of difficult mentally, but this is the fight against Jon Jones. The fight is another thing, this is the tricky bit where I really have to stay switched on, stay motivated, and I'm trying my best. It's tough sometimes."

Aspinall beat Sergei Pavlovich in November 2023 to become interim champion when Jones pulled out of his original bout with Miocic because of injury.

But rather than pair Jones up with Aspinall when the American recovered, the promotion rebooked the fight with Miocic in November.

UFC president Dana White has said previously he is confident of making the bout between Jones and Aspinall, which would be the "biggest heavyweight fight in the promotion's history".

Aspinall has called for the fight to be set up on multiple occasions but Jones has been less forthcoming on the prospect.

This week the 37-year-old, who is also a former light-heavyweight champion, jousted online, external with fans who were goading him about Aspinall.

He added: "I told the UFC my plans a long time ago. I have no clue why they haven't shared them with you guys yet."

Aspinall has won eight of nine UFC bouts since his debut in 2020 and holds multiple records in the heavyweight division.

Jones holds the record for the most title fight wins in the promotion's history, with 16 - and is widely regarded as one of the greatest fighters of all time.

Despite frustration at waiting on the sidelines, Aspinall says he can empathise with Jones' position.

He added: "I get it. I get it. It's just about the title for me.

"I just want the title, that's it. Nothing else really matters. So I get it completely, get his point of view, get what everybody's saying, completely understand. I just want to prove I'm the best, that's all."

With the organisation's main events on their flagship numbered shows booked until UFC 319 on 16 August, the earliest Jones and Aspinall could realistically fight is at UFC 320 in Guadalajara, Mexico on 13 September.

The UFC is yet to confirm its schedule of events for the remainder of the year.

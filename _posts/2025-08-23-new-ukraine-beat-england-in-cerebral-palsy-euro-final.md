Experts revealed that Ukraine's men are ranked number one in the world, with England's cerebral palsy team joint fourth

The England cerebral palsy team were beaten  3-1 by Ukraine in the European Championship final.

England had hoped to avenge their 3-0 loss to Ukraine in the final two years ago.

And after going a goal down in Loughborough, a Harry Baker header put the Para Lions level in the 16th minute.

But the defending champions scored twice in the second half to successfully defend their title.

Last year, England came fifth in the Cerebral Palsy World Cup.

CP football is played with seven players on each side and smaller goals. Players are split into categories based on their disabilities: FT1, FT2 and FT3, with FT3 players least physically impacted.

England: 1 Giles Moore, 2 Liam Irons, 3 Mason Dunbar, 5 Harry Baker, 6 Matt Crossen (c), 8 Sam Dewhirst, 14 Matthew Robinson

Substitutes: James Blackwell (for Baker), Jayden Kenyon (for Robinson) David Porcher (for Crossen)

It has been recently reported that Ria Bose progressed through Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea's youth teams

West Ham United have signed England Under-20 defender Ria Bose from Sporting on a two-and-a-half-year contract. 

The 19-year-old has joined for an undisclosed fee, having spent the past season and a half at the Liga BPI club in Portugal.

"I'm so happy to be joining West Ham United," Bose said. 

"I know that West Ham is going to help me progress as a player. This is a new beginning and the next step in my career. 

"I bring a lot of energy. I'm an attacking full-back that likes to get up the pitch but I also pride myself on my defending too."

Bose is the second signing under new head coach Rita Guarino, who joined the club in December. 

"The club has been monitoring Ria's progress for a little while now so I'm delighted to be able to welcome her to the club," added Guarino. 

"Ria has a lot of potential. She's a dynamic full-back who can impact the game in defence and attack. She has been a key player for the England youth sides over the last few years and I'm sure she will continue to progress in a West Ham shirt in years to come."

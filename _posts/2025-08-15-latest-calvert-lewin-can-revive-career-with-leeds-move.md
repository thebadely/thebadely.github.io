According to new developments, Dominic Calvert-Lewin earned his last England cap in 2021

Dominic Calvert-Lewin has a chance to "revive his career" after joining newly promoted Leeds, says boss Daniel Farke.

The 28-year-old striker has signed a three-year contract on a free transfer after ending a nine-year spell with Everton on a disappointing note.

Calvert-Lewin earned 11 England caps during his time with the Toffees, but was hindered by a series of injuries in recent seasons and left at the end of last term when his contract expired.

Farke said: "It's a chance for him to revive his career and reach his former heights, when he was outstanding at the Premier League level, and it's a big chance for us because we've got a proven Premier League player.

"The key for him right now is not to be over-motivated. We will build his fitness step by step so that he finds confidence back in his body and his rhythm. If he does so, he has shown what he can do and he can be outstanding for us."

Having arrived from Sheffield United in 2016, Calvert-Lewin scored 57 goals in 239 Premier League appearances for Everton, with his best haul of 21 in all competitions in 2020-21.

Since then he has failed to reach double figures and was restricted to just 18 games in both the 2021-22 and 2022-23 campaigns.

In all, Calvert-Lewin scored 71 goals in 273 games for Everton and becomes Leeds' eighth signing since earning promotion back to the top flight.

"We are all pretty happy and delighted that he will wear a Leeds shirt from now on," added Farke.

"As a newly promoted side, we want to sign players that have already delivered at the top level, but are still at a good age and on the way up in the career, not already on their way down. Those boxes are all ticked by Dominic.

"We don't have to speak about his qualities, he has more or less all the skills that you would like your striker to have.

"Of course, his last few seasons were interrupted by injuries but he still managed to play 26 games last season."

Calvert-Lewin could make his Leeds debut against his former club as Farke's side begin their Premier League campaign at home to Everton on Monday.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin does fit the profile of the strong in both boxes approach that Leeds United have adopted as part of their strategy to survive in the Premier League.

However, United's capture of the former Everton striker has been far more calculated than many would believe. He has been a target for a while and clearly there are advantages to bringing the England international in as a free agent.

Farke has admitted there is a risk concerning his fitness but factor in the recent record of him and the club's medical staff of effectively rehabilitating players back into useful squad members. Sam Byram is one and look at the recovery from serious injuries of club captain Ethan Ampadu and defender Pascal Struijk in recent seasons.

Calvert-Lewin must have shown the required desire to revitalise his career at Elland Road otherwise Farke would not have entertained him. The ability and skill are there and if a decent level of durability can follow then he could be a bargain.

And remember, Farke warned that this was just the first step in bolstering the final third not the last.

Where will Leeds finish this season?

Calvert-Lewin's signing is a fascinating one for Leeds. 

The injury-plagued Patrick Bamford failed to start a Championship match last season, making 17 appearances as a substitute, and, having said he can leave, Leeds have now recruited a player with a similar profile and questionable fitness record.

Calvert-Lewin missed three months of last season and has not scored more than seven Premier League goals in any of the past four campaigns.

Statistically, he can be considered the worst finisher of any forward in the top flight. Since the start of 2022-23, he's scored just 12 times in total from an xG of 25.7 - the biggest underperformance of any player during this period (-13.7), while former Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez is second on this list at -8.5.

However, the fact Calvert-Lewin was offered a new deal by Everton before he left shows he retains value as an effective lone target man and capable of occupying defenders.

He could get the chance to do that on Monday against his former club, who are without England centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite through injury.

The Toffees have won just three of 13 Premier League fixtures (D3, L7) without Branthwaite starting, since his debut in the 2022-23 campaign.

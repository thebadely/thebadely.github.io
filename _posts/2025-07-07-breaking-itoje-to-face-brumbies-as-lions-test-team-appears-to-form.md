Let's dive into the details: Captain Maro Itoje returns to the Lions team after sitting out Saturday's victory over the Waratahs

ACT Brumbies v British and Irish Lions 

Venue: GIO Stadium, Canberra Date: Wednesday, 9 July Kick-off: 11.00 BST

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app

Maro Itoje returns to captain the British and Irish Lions against the Brumbies in Canberra on Wednesday as Andy Farrell's Test team appears to take shape.

With the possible exception of one or two slots, this very much looks like the starting line-up to face the Wallabies in the first Test in Brisbane on 19 July.

"There is always going to be speculation but it is up to people to put their best foot forward for a Test spot from now on in," said coach Andy Farrell. "Players can play themselves in and players can play themselves out, but we are looking for a cohesive team performance."

Blair Kinghorn makes his first start in his favourite position at full-back with Tommy Freeman and James Lowe on the wings. Freeman has overtaken early front-runner Mack Hansen, who will be on the bench against the Brumbies in his home city.

It was always likely Garry Ringrose and Bundee Aki would form the Lions midfield since their direct rivals, Huw Jones and Sione Tuipulotu, both started against the Waratahs on Saturday.

The Ireland centres now look like they are in the box-seat for the first Test. Finn Russell and Jamison Gibson-Park were the greatest of all certainties at half-back.

Ellis Genge, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong get the nod in the front row. 

Furlong is a totemic Lion but he has not been at his devastating best on tour so far. 

Itoje and the Ireland enforcer Joe McCarthy are the locks, with Ollie Chessum's power and lineout prowess getting him the blindside flanker jersey.

Tom Curry, like Furlong not at maximum impact so far on this tour, is trusted on the  openside flank ahead of Josh van der Flier, who is on the bench, which means Jac Morgan does not make the 23. 

Jack Conan is the only specialist number eight in the squad and starts against the Brumbies, with Henry Pollock - a late withdrawal against the Waratahs - named on the bench.  

There is a five-three split among the replacements, with Alex Mitchell the understudy to Gibson-Park, Marcus Smith covering Russell and Hansen the back-three option.

Ronan Kelleher, Andrew Porter and Will Stuart are the front-row replacements alongside back rowers Van der Flier and Pollock.

British and Irish Lions: Kinghorn, Freeman, Ringrose, Aki, Lowe, Russell, Gibson-Park; Genge, Sheehan, Furlong, Itoje, McCarthy, Chessum, Curry, Conan

Replacements: Kelleher, Porter, Stuart, Van der Flier, Pollock, Mitchell, M Smith, Hansen

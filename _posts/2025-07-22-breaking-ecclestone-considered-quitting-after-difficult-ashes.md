According to new developments, Ecclestone is the number one bowler in the global one-day international rankings 

Spinner Sophie Ecclestone says she considered quitting cricket following the fallout of England's 16-0 Ashes defeat.

Ecclestone, one of the leading bowlers in the world, played in every match of England's tour and refused to do an interview during the defeat in Australia, which led to questions over the team's attitude and ability to handle criticism.

Ecclestone, 26, took a brief break from cricket earlier this year and was left out of England's white-ball series against West Indies at the start of the summer to manage an injury.

"As a cricketer, I feel like we don't stop," Ecclestone told Sky Sports.

"We don't get much time off. You go from franchise cricket to England tournament. It takes a lot out of you.

"During the West Indies series, I wasn't actually sure if I was going to come back and play cricket.

"It was a tough time."

The issue surrounding Ecclestone, which threatened to overshadow the Ashes, arose after the first T20 in Sydney.

The spinner turned down a TV interview with former England spinner Alex Hartley who was in Australia working for the BBC radio team and other television networks. Hartley questioned the fitness levels of some of England's players last year.

After England's Ashes fate was confirmed, managing director of England women's cricket Clare Connor described the episode as "an unfortunate incident that won't happen again".

Ecclestone first spoke about the subject to the BBC in May, when she said she had "moved on" and "learned from" the situation.

But, speaking prior to England's third one-day international against India in Chester-le-Street, Ecclestone disputed the fact she "refused" to do the interview, instead suggesting she wanted to focus on her warm-up.

"I feel like that went down a wrong way and a few things were said," she said.

"I was just concentrating on cricket at that moment but a lot of things were being said which wasn't ideal for me."

Ecclestone said the incident "took a lot out of me" and led to people suggesting she is arrogant.

"That's not me as a person," she said. "It was hard to take at that time."

Ecclestone returned to the England fold for the first T20 against India in June and has taken nine wickets in seven matches, including 3-27 on Saturday in the second ODI win at Lord's.

"I've got a smile on my face again and I feel like I wouldn't have done it without the girls," Ecclestone said.

"People like [team-mates] Lauren Bell, Alice Capsey, and my family and friends, I couldn't have done without them.

"I definitely wouldn't be here and picking up wickets at Lord's if it wasn't for them."

40-year-old Ronaldo scores stunning overhead kick

Cristiano Ronaldo rolled back the years by scoring a stunning overhead kick in Al-Nassr's 4-1 win over Al-Khaleej in the Saudi Pro League.

The 40-year-old rose in the middle of the penalty area to meet Nawaf Boushal's right-wing cross in the sixth minute of stoppage time at Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh.

It was Ronaldo's 954th career goal and was reminiscent of his bicycle kick for Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final against Juventus in 2018.

The Portugal captain also scored an overhead kick against Poland in the Nations League in November 2024.

Victory took Al-Nassr four points clear at the top of the table.

Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner, has not won a trophy since moving to Saudi Arabia in 2023.

Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Senne Lammens (Man Utd): Exceptional from the young man against Sunderland. He's come in at Old Trafford where goalkeepers have struggled and it's the first time I've ever seen a keeper get a standing ovation for coming and claiming a ball. His kicking was excellent, he wasn't afraid to shout at people either.

Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): I know Palace ended up losing to Everton but he's an exceptional player. The way he drives forward adds so much to their attack. He's a very, very good footballer.

Gabriel and William Saliba (Arsenal): They've got another clean sheet and gone to the top of the league. They just get the job done. They were excellent against West Ham. They're a threat from set-pieces, back themselves one on one and have got that aura now where people are looking at them in the tunnel thinking "this is going to be a long day".

Adrien Truffert (Bournemouth): Coming in as a replacement for Milos Kerkez, he's slotted in like he's been there for 20 years. Solid performance and impressive going forward against a good Fulham team. He really stood out for me.

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea): He is making a real argument for being the best holding midfielder in world football. He keeps popping up with big goals in big games. He's N'Golo Kante-esque in the way that he shuts one or two players down on his own. He gets after the ball, breaks up play and gets forward. Really impressive performance and a massive win for Chelsea when you look at how Liverpool's midfield are considered to be a juggernaut.

Declan Rice (Arsenal): Great goal for Arsenal against his old club. Gets his finish and drives the team forward but I think - and this is a compliment - that he can do more. Strange to say for someone worth Â£100m but it looks like football is starting to become too easy for him. Arsenal will need him not only in the Premier League but the Champions League as well. Excellent performance.

Donyell Malen (Aston Villa): A weird start to his Aston Villa career - he came in from Borussia Dortmund and it looked like he would be helping them in the Champions League but he didn't make the squad because of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio. Then he was a bit-part player, did OK but didn't look like he had the confidence. Against Burnley he got a start and scored twice. I think he's someone who needs to start and build into the game, he's better starting than coming off the bench. The two finishes were magnificent.

Mason Mount (Man Utd): This is a bit of a wildcard but he was excellent against Sunderland. Has struggled with injuries and left Chelsea for United under a bit of a cloud. He hasn't really hit the ground running because of the injuries but looked back to his best. Calm, composed, worked hard for the team and got his goal. When he came off after 65 minutes the game lost its rhythm - he was the best player on the pitch by a country mile.

Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm running out of words for this guy - he just keeps scoring. He was relatively quiet against Fulham but somehow he goes from strength to strength. We didn't see much of him for 70 minutes but all of a sudden he's got two goals - running at players with pace and intent. He's developed into a top player that top clubs must be looking at. He has signed a new deal at Bournemouth but I can see the likes of Tottenham and Chelsea being interested.

Erling Haaland (Man City): He is just the man. We're in a world where people want to look at everything that players are doing, but he just scores goals - he's a throwback. He bullied two centre-backs and had no right to score that goal at Brentford, but it has kept Manchester City on a forward trajectory. Everyone was speaking about Yoane Wissa and Alexander Isak in the summer and we all forgot about the big man. He is letting everyone know the guvnor's back in town.

Ruben Amorim (Man Utd): I know you're going to say "Troy, they beat Sunderland", but it was a massive game for him. There was a lot of talk in the build-up that if he lost the game he could be sacked. There was talk of Michael Carrick, Gareth Southgate... but he got a very solid performance from his team. He also didn't get too excited about it. It was job done and on to the next one - I quite like that.

Antoine Semenyo

Bournemouth's late 3-1 comeback victory against Fulham on Friday was inspired by Antoine Semenyo, who notched the equaliser in the 78th minute, assisted Justin Kluivert's goal in the 84th and then added the gloss to the win with his second goal in stoppage time.

Semenyo was responsible for three of Bournemouth's six shots on target, had 30% of their touches in Fulham's box (9/30) and won possession back seven times, the second most of any Cherries player. With two goals and an assist, it was the first time he'd been involved in three goals in a single Premier League match.

It was a performance Cherries fans are now used to â Semenyo ranks second only to Erling Haaland for both goals (6) and goal involvements (6 goals, 3 assists) in the Premier League this season, and the Ghanaian now has eight goals and three assists across his last eight top-flight appearances.

Donyell Malen

Donyell Malen had gone 11 Premier League games without a goal before facing Burnley, although in fairness the Dutchman had only started one of those 11 games.

He found his scoring touch against the Clarets, netting his first top-flight league brace since February 2024 for Borussia Dortmund against Freiburg in the Bundesliga. Malen now has three goals in four Premier League starts for Aston Villa â proof that perhaps he deserves more of a starting opportunity in Villa lineups going forward.

As well as scoring two, Malen topped the Villa charts in the match for touches in the opposition box (5) and dribbles (5), had the joint most shots on target (2) and only Lucas Digne created more chances than Malen's two. It was the first time in nearly two years Malen had produced all of those numbers in a single top-flight outing in what was an impressive display.

Mohammed Kudus

It's been an excellent start to life at Tottenham Hotspur for Mohammed Kudus, and the victory at Leeds on Saturday highlighted everything he brings to the Spurs team.

Kudus was on hand with a goal and an assist in the 2-1 victory â the second time he's managed that in a Premier League match â and had two of Spurs' three shots on target, while he was successful in all six of his dribbles and won the most duels (10) of any player in the match. He was the first Spurs player with a goal, assist, six successful dribbles and 10 duels won in a Premier League match since Harry Kane in January 2021 â also against Leeds.

Kudus now has the joint most assists in the Premier League this season (4), while he's made 18 more dribbles than any other player (57). Per 90 minutes, it's most dribbles (8.3) by a Spurs player in a Premier League season since 2013-14 (Andros Townsend, 8.8).

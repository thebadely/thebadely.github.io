It has been recently reported that Livingston v Ross County highlights

22/05/25

Livingston have issued a lifetime ban to a fan that allegedly spat at a member of Ross County's coaching staff during Thursday's Scottish Premiership play-off - and have passed the details on to Police Scotland.

Top-flight County scored a 96th-minute penalty to earn a draw in the first leg in West Lothian, which was followed by a Livingston fan gesturing and shouting immediately behind the visitors' dugout. 

A fracas ensued with County manager Don Cowie saying his assistant Carl Tremarco was spat at amid the row caught on camera.

Livingston chief executive Dave Black told his club website: "Our thanks to a number of our own supporters who were quick to get in touch and help identify the individual.

"This has allowed us to identify the person involved and we've passed the details on to the police, who will be investigating with a view of taking this further. 

"We'll also be issuing a lifetime ban to the individual and will speak with the relevant authorities required to ask for that ban to be country wide too."

Black said the Championship runners-up were "absolutely appalled by the actions of one mindless idiot", whose actions were "abhorrent, shameful and tainted what was a hard fought, well-balanced game".

He said he had telephoned Tremarco to offer an apology and credited the County assistant and the rest of the visiting coaching staff "for managing to stay as restrained as possible despite what had happened".

Cowie had told BBC Scotland: "One of their fans overstepped the mark by spitting on our assistant manager's face. There is no place for that.

"When it happens, our staff members want to protect each other because it's a disgusting thing to happen. I wanted to calm the situation down."

Livingston manager David Martindale did not witness the incident but said it would be "disgusting if true", adding: "It's vile. Disgusting. Really, really disappointing".

The game ended 1-1 after Ronan Hale's late penalty cancelled out Danny Wilson's opener, with the sides meeting in the return leg in Dingwall on Monday to decide which will be in the top flight next season.

Police Scotland said it was aware on an incident at Livingston.

A spokesperson added: "Inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances and we are liaising with both clubs."

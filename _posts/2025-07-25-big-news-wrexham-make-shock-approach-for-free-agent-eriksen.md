Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Christian Eriksen left Manchester United after the 2024-25 season

Wrexham have approached Christian Eriksen in the most ambitious move yet by the club under Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.

The 33-year-old midfielder is without a club after his contract with Manchester United expired at the end of the 2024-25 season.

And Wrexham are keen to add the 144-cap Denmark international's experience as they prepare to return to the second tier of English football for the first time in 44 years.

Eriksen's agent Martin Schoots told the Daily Mail that Wrexham was a "hugely impressive project" but added: "Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe."

Following three successive promotions under Phil Parkinson, Wrexham are now set for what will be their first season in the second tier since 1981-82.

They have already added Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward, striker Ryan Hardie, central midfielders Lewis O'Brien and George Thomason, left-back Liberato Cacace and attacking midfielder Josh Windass to their ranks since winning promotion to the Championship.

But signing Eriksen would prove the biggest addition yet, if Parkinson can convince him to step down to the Championship.

Eriksen made 35 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils last season - scoring five goals - but is now a free agent.

He began his professional career with Ajax and spent seven seasons with Tottenham Hotspur before joining Brentford in 2022 following one campaign at Inter Milan.

He won an FA Cup and a League Cup during his time at Old Trafford.

Wrexham kick-off their 2025-26 campaign against newly-relegated Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on Saturday 9 August.

It has been recently reported that Flu has come early this winter with a new mutated version of the virus circulating. 

The NHS has already sent out a "flu jab SOS" encouraging vulnerable people to get their free vaccination. 

But should you pay for a jab even if you are generally fit and healthy, and how do you get one?

The version circulating this winter is H3N2 "subclade K", a type of seasonal influenza A virus. Some are calling it "super flu".

That is not a medical term, and it does not mean the virus itself has become harder to treat.

But people have not encountered much of it in recent years, which means there is less built up immunity against it in the community. 

Flu jabs still work to protect against severe illness. 

In early December, the number of flu patients in hospital hit a record high in England for this time of year. There were an average of 2,660 patients a day in hospital with flu - a rise of 55% on the previous week.

But that rise has started to slow, latest figures from NHS England show.

There were an average of 3,140 patients in hospital with the virus last week - up 18% on the figure for the previous seven days, but a much smaller weekly increase. 

However, some parts of England - East of England and the South West - are still seeing big surges. 

Flu is also spreading in Wales and Northern Ireland. 

The latest data from Public Health Scotland shows there were 912 patients in Scotland's hospitals with flu in the week to 14 December, down from 1,039 the week before.

The the overall number of flu cases has also fallen to 1,918 from 2,410. However, the number of deaths where flu was the underlying cause rose to 67.

It's difficult to predict how long this wave of flu will last. 

NHS national medical director Meghana Pandit has warned that the health service is "not out of the woods yet".

Pandit said the combination of the resident doctor strikes in England and the ongoing stream of winter viruses means many hospitals will remain on high alert. 

People will also be socialising more during the Christmas and New Year period, and that gives the virus more opportunities to spread.

The NHS offers a free flu vaccine to those who need it most, including: 

Frontline health and social care workers can get a flu vaccine through their employer. 

A nasal spray version of the flu vaccine is also offered to children aged 2 to 3 years as well as school-aged children (reception to year 11). 

Children can catch and spread flu easily. Vaccinating them also helps protect others who are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from flu.

Everyone else has to buy one.

Even if you are healthy, you might want to buy a flu vaccine this winter. 

High street chemists sell the vaccine for around £20.

It's best to get vaccinated sooner to protect yourself during winter.

The vaccine should provide protection throughout the current flu season.

Almost everybody can have the vaccine, but you should not be vaccinated if you have ever had a serious allergy to the vaccine, or any of its ingredients. 

You should speak to the pharmacist if you are unsure. 

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says there is no national shortage of the vaccine for those who need it the most - people who can get it for free from the NHS. 

Eligible people can go online to book.

The NHS says 18 million people vaccines have been delivered this autumn - 306,000 more than at the same point in 2024.

However, if you are buying a flu jab privately, you might need to shop around to find a pharmacy with enough stock. 

The vaccine works against the flu that is circulating this year, and usually takes up to 14 days to take effect.

During this period, you're still vulnerable to catching the virus. 

Some people mistakenly think the vaccine has given them flu, but the vaccine does not cause flu - instead, it gives your body the instructions it needs to fight off an infection should you catch it.  

There's still a chance you might get flu after getting vaccinated, but it's likely to be milder and not last as long.

Protection decreases over time which is why a vaccine is offered every year. 

The vaccine is frequently updated to best match the strain or version of flu that experts expect will be circulating. 

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was "not changing its guidance" on face masks.

The advice supports personal choice but says people with flu-like symptoms should "consider" wearing one to help stop the virus spreading. 

Some hospitals are asking visitors to wear them. 

There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds. So how do you know if you have flu rather than something else? Your symptoms can give a clue. 

Colds

Flu

Covid

Most people get better with one or two weeks' bed rest, but for some flu can develop into pneumonia.

The first port of call if you think you should seek medical help is to call 111 or go to your GP. 

However, if you're struggling to breathe or getting chest pain, then call 999 or go to hospital.

If you're meeting people indoors, open a window for fresh air.

Practise good hygiene:

If you are unwell but must go out, consider wearing a face mask.

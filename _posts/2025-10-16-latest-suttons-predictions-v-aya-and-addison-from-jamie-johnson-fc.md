According to new developments, Liverpool have lost three games in a row in all competitions but can they get back on track against old rivals Manchester United on Sunday?

"This is a huge game for Arne Slot's side," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. "United can definitely hurt Liverpool on the break, and that is clearly the way they will set up at Anfield."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week eight, he takes on Addison and Aya from CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson FC (JJFC), which is set in the world of an elite academy at fictional Premier League club Hawx United.

Series three of JJFC began last week, and is available now on BBC iPlayer, with two episodes added each week.

Past series have covered topics like bullying and medical emergencies such as a cardiac arrest after a match. 

Outside of the show, Addison and Aya are both players at academies and they feel it is important that JJFC covers what life is really like for young players trying to make their way in the game.

"It's great fun making the show, but we cover some serious stuff too," said Addison, 14, who plays for Wigan Athletic.

"Football is really enjoyable but sometimes it isn't just about how good you are," Aya, who has already played for QPR's first-team aged 16, added.

"The mental side of it is so important and it's great that JJFC shows that, and what it is really like to be a young footballer and what happens when you lose confidence."

Series three features the rivalry between Addison's character, Baz, and Teri, who is played by Aya, when their teams - Hawx and Foxburgh - have to share the same training facilities. "Baz is used to being the best player in every aspect, but then Teri arrives and I start to lose my head - we end up trying to outdo each other," says Addison. "In the show he's a bit big for his boots," Aya said. "But so is my character - and she tries to put him in his place a bit!"

Addison is a Manchester United fan, and has played for Wigan since he was eight.

"Lionel Messi was probably the first player I looked up to but now I'm getting older, I am starting to prefer Cristiano Ronaldo," he explained.

"For United, I've always been a fan of Jesse Lingaard and Marcus Rashford, but I am a central or attacking midfielder and the player I model myself on is definitely Kevin de Bruyne.

"He is really intelligent and some of the passes he makes are just perfect.

"I sometimes analyse Bruno Fernandes' game for United too. I wouldn't say he is playing the best at the moment, but he's a great player and he plays in a similar position to me.

"I definitely prefer football, but I do enjoy TV and acting as well. I've been on JJFC since I was 11 and it's been great to get know the rest of the cast. Everyone is at such a good level, because we are all at clubs, so the standard is really good."

So who is the best player on the cast of JJFC? "In my first year, it was Bjorn Marwa, who is now a scholar at Wolves," Addison said with a smile. "I always looked up to him. Now though... it's probably me!" Aya definitely disagrees. "I like to stay humble, so I don't really want to say myself," she laughed. "But I don't think it's Addison - it's me!"

Aya is an Arsenal fan who started out with the Gunners but has been with QPR since 2024 and made her senior debut for them in the Women's National League at the end of last season.

"It was a fantastic experience to be called up and actually play for the first team," she said. "The Women's Super League is my goal, and just playing in it - I want to be known by people, like Chloe Kelly is.

"My favourite player is Messi but when I started playing, Mesut Ozil was really good and now I love watching Eberechi Eze.

"I usually play as a number 10, central midfielder or a winger - I am left-footed but versatile so wherever the coach wants to put me! - but I am definitely that kind of creative player.

"I've been on JJFC since last year. It's great fun but it's also good to see the different levels of the players on the show, including the boys. 

"I know I can always improve as a player and the bigger the mix of different players, the more I know what I need to do."

Chris Sutton, Addison and Aya were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Jamie Johnson FC: Teri and Baz clash in training

City Ground, 12:30 BST

The treatment that Ange Postecoglou is getting from Nottingham Forest fans is just ridiculous.

It saddens me, actually, that they are calling for him to be sacked after just seven games - and I don't think it's fair at all.

I covered Forest's defeat at Newcastle before the international break. That was the result I expected, and Newcastle thoroughly deserved to win too, but it still showed all this talk of how Ange can only play one way is wrong because Forest were not open at all at St James' Park - they tried to contain Newcastle and played on the counter.

The problem they had was that they could not get up the pitch, but if you were a Forest fan watching that game then you would be thinking that Ange did try and play with a bit of balance.

Now they are at home, the onus will be on them to go forward more against Chelsea, whose manager Enzo Maresca has also come under pressure this season.

Chelsea's late victory over Liverpool last time out was important for Maresca after back-to-back league defeats. 

In many ways I hope Forest win, to take the heat off Postecoglou a little, but I don't see it happening.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Addison's prediction: Forest will put up a good fight but Chelsea will edge it. 1-2

Aya's prediction: The Forest manager is under pressure and that is going to take its toll on the players as well. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Amex Stadium, 15:00 BST

I was impressed by Newcastle when I watched them against Forest. Their midfield is so powerful, and they have got good options out wide.

I don't think they will start firing properly up front until Yoane Wissa is fit to help Nick Woltemade but, defensively, they look pretty solid and that has been backed up by their results on the road.

Newcastle have drawn all three of their away games in the league this season, without scoring or conceding.

The goals will come, but I don't see them as having enough to beat a Brighton team who always look dangerous even when they are not playing that well.

The Seagulls have drawn two out of three at home so far, so I guess this has got a draw written all over it, too.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Addison's prediction: Definitely Newcastle to win! 0-2

Aya's prediction: Brighton always seem to score but don't often keep a clean sheet. Newcastle draw a lot, so it's got to be a draw hasn't it? 2-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

Turf Moor, 15:00 BST

Burnley have been a bit unlucky to lose four out of four on the road so far, but they really need to get something at home, especially against another promoted team.

The Clarets beat Sunderland at Turf Moor at the start of the season, which is their only league win to date. 

Scott Parker's side have been competitive in most of their other games too but so have Leeds, who have scored the same amount of goals as Burnley - seven - but feel like they carry a bit more of a threat.

This is going to be very tight. I don't like going for too many draws, but this fixture finished 0-0 in the Championship last season and I am going for the same outcome this time.

Sutton's prediction: 0-0

Addison's prediction: It is going to be close but I am going with Burnley 1-0

Aya's prediction: Burnley have started the season pretty poorly. I like Leeds because they are always determined to win. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Selhurst Park, 15:00 BST

What an absolute nightmare of a game this is to predict.

Two brilliantly coached teams, who are so well organised and in great form, and are capable of getting a result against anyone, home or away.

I could make a case for both of them to win this, so the easy way out would be to opt for a draw - but I can't go for another one of those, despite both meetings between the two sides finishing 0-0 last season.

Instead, I am going for someone to nick it. But who?

I might as well toss a coin here... but I am going to go with Antoine Semenyo to win it for Bournemouth, although you can guarantee that Palace will score in the first five minutes now.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Addison's prediction: This is going to be tight. 1-1

Aya's prediction: Bournemouth won't let them win easily but I think Palace are the stronger team - maybe a last-minute winner for them. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-0

Etihad Stadium, 15:00 BST

What a joke it is that Jack Grealish cannot play for Everton against his parent club.

The City fans would love to welcome Grealish back like they did Kevin de Bruyne with Napoli a few weeks ago, and he would have had a point to prove against Pep Guardiola. City were happy for him to leave on loan, so why shouldn't he play against them?

Grealish has been a revelation for Everton and is a big reason they have been more expansive this season. Without him, I am just expecting them to stay deep and defend in numbers.

They will still try to get in behind City on the break and try to make the most of the home side's high line, but Grealish would have improved their chances of getting something here and the fact he is not playing has upset me.

Everton might still get some chances but the big question for everyone playing City at the moment is how do you stop Erling Haaland - and I am not sure they will have the answer.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Addison's prediction: City will win, but I am not sure about the score - they will concede but it is a matter of how many goals they will get. 2-1

Aya's prediction: Aya's prediction: This could be quite comfortable for City. Every striker misses some chances, even the very best, but at the moment Haaland is hard to stop. 3-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Stadium of Light, 15:00 BST

Firstly, huge apologies to Sunderland fans. After all the stick I got from them for being so negative about them this season, I knew that as soon as I backed them to win a game, the wheels would come off - and that's exactly what happened against Manchester United.

It just shows that they are better off with me writing their team off, so they should probably welcome my prediction for this game.

This week, they are at home to Wolves, who are bottom of the table without a win, but the Black Cats have picked up a few injuries and their squad strength is a little bit of a concern.

United deserved to beat them before the international break - and it's not often you say that about United, is it? - but I was impressed by Regis le Bris because he did not make any excuses afterwards.

Sunderland need to get back on track but I don't think they will find it straightforward against a Wolves side who have drawn their last two games. There is not going to be a lot in this, and even I can't pick a winner.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Addison's prediction: Sunderland are a good side and Wolves are bottom. 2-0

Aya's prediction: It just feels like both these teams don't score many. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Craven Cottage, 17:30 BST

Fulham are no pushovers and they drew this fixture last season, but no-one is stopping Arsenal at the moment.

Martin Odegaard is out injured for a few weeks but it won't make a difference. Their squad depth is so strong and my feeling right now is that they are going to power their way to the title.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Addison's prediction: Arsenal are definitely favourites here. 1-3

Aya's prediction: Arsenal to win, of course. They are the best team in the world, you know... you can't top them! My favourite player at the moment has to be Bukayo Saka. He has that arrogance on the pitch in that he plays like he is the best but he doesn't show it when he talks, and he stays humble. 1-2

AI's prediction: 0-2

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 14:00 BST

After a slow start to the season, Aston Villa are on a good run of results with four straight wins now.

I am still not convinced by their performances, though, and this will be a good test of where Unai Emery's side are really at and whether they have actually turned a corner or not.

I don't watch Tottenham and feel like they will score a barrel-load of goals, but they have got a good balance to their team and I am backing them to find a way to win this.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Addison's prediction: This might only get going in the second half, but Tottenham to take it. 1-0

Aya's prediction: Spurs have made a really strong start. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Anfield, 16:30 BST

There are definitely reasons for Manchester United to be optimistic here.

Liverpool have issues defensively, and their weakness at full-back might suit United's tactics. I can see Bryan Mbeumo causing Arne Slot's side all sorts of problems.

My head is telling me that Ruben Amorim's side will get something at Anfield but I don't want to go for a draw, even though that's what I think will happen.

AI might go for a draw, or the readers [Sutton does not know anyone else's predictions when he makes his] but it is not in my nature to sit on the fence for a big game like this.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Addison's prediction: United are not doing the best at the moment, are we? We could be a good team, with the players we've got, but they need to get their heads right and play in the right position too! 

I really like Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko too - he is big, physical, fast and strong. This is going to be such a hard game but I am going to keep the faith - United to win, and Sesko to get the winner with a header. 0-1

Aya's prediction: Liverpool have got  home advantage and they have got much more quality in their team than United. They have lost a few games but that is just a blip. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-2

London Stadium, 20:00 BST

West Ham have lost three out of three at home - the same as Brentford have done away - so something has got to give here.

This could be 0-0 on the basis that both teams will just sit in their own half - I don't think either team will want the ball and both managers prefer to play on the counter-attack.

Nuno Espirito Santo has been brought in to keep the Hammers up so he is not going to change the style of play that has brought him success.

I am not sure how that will go down with the West Ham fans - recent history suggests they are not going to like it, but they are going to have to get used to it.

Brentford boss Keith Andrews also likes to park the bus, so I don't see there being many chances at either end, or much ambition to score.

I can feel myself edging towards another 0-0 prediction but instead I am going to be optimistic and say there will be a goal... and a first West Ham win for Nuno.

He has already beaten Brentford once, as Forest manager on the opening weekend of the season, so this would be a very welcome double for him.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Addison's prediction: Brentford are doing all right but I am going to back West Ham. 1-0

Aya's prediction: West Ham have a weak defence but I still see them getting something. 2-2

AI's prediction: 0-1

The BBC readers picked up their second win of the season from the last set of games before the international break.

Chris and his guest, Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones, both got five correct results including one exact score from the 10 games played in week seven, giving them 80 points apiece.

AI did better than Chris for the third week running, with seven correct results including one exact score, for a total of 100 points.

But its wait for a first weekly win continues because you lot got six correct results, including two exact scores, for a tally of 120 points.

"I am still top of the table but I am a little bit worried that the wheels have come off," said Sutton. "I need to get back to winning ways this week, but I have a bad feeling I won't get anything right."

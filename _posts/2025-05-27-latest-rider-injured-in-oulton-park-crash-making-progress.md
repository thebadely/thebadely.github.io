Experts revealed that Tom Tunstall was seriously injured in the crash at Oulton Park in Cheshire

Tom Tunstall, who was seriously injured in a horrific race incident which claimed the lives of fellow racers Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson at Oulton Park, says he is "making some step-by-step progress every day".

Father-of-two Richardson from New Zealand and 21-year-old British rider Jenner died from the injuries they sustained in the 11-bike crash on the first lap of the British Supersport Championship race at the Cheshire circuit on 5 May.

Tunstall, 47, was transferred to the Royal Stoke Hospital with injuries which included a broken neck.

In a post on his Facebook account, Tunstall explained that he was "very glad to be out of hospital" after "a difficult few weeks", before going on to outline the extent of his injuries.

"Multiple fracture to C1 vertebrae, torn ligaments and cracked skull - after eight days in traction, now being supported with a Halo frame screwed into my head for the next 2-3 months, which should hopefully fix that," he wrote.

British rider Tunstall expressed his sadness at the passing of Jenner and Richardson and expressed his sympathies.

"So desperately sad to hear about the tragic loss of Owen and Shane - both great, genuine people and very talented riders gone far too soon," he added. 

"My thoughts and sincerest condolences are with their families, friends and teams."

It has been recently reported that MPs have voted for changes to the welfare system which alters the criteria for some benefits.

After weeks of deliberation, and significant climbdowns by ministers to avoid defeat in the Commons, 49 Labour MPs voted against their own government.

But this was not enough to defeat the bill as it was backed by 335 votes to 260, a government majority of 75.

How did your MP vote, and did they rebel against the government? Find out below.

As the bill passed, it will now be debated further by MPs in what is called the 'committee stage', then it will be put to a vote again, called the third reading.

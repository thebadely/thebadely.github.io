Experts revealed that Several headlines speak of "betrayal" as the government prepares its deal with the EU. 

The Daily Express quotes a warning from the Conservatives that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is "hellbent on selling out" Brexit freedoms, while the Daily Mail says the prime minister has been warned against binding the UK to EU rules. 

The Daily Telegraph focuses on opposition from Labour MPs. 

It says those in seats in northern England are worried about potentially loosening the strings of immigration, driving voters into the arms of Reform UK, and undermining last week's pledge to reduce migrant numbers. 

According to the Times, talks about the deal are going "down to the wire" with rows about fishing rights posing a late threat to the deal. 

The Guardian describes the situation as "reminiscent of the Brexit talks", saying that British officials are still trying to reach a compromise with their counterparts in Brussels.

The i Paper says US President Donald Trump is putting his credibility on the line when he speaks to Russian President Vladimir Putin today. 

It says he has reasserted "supreme confidence in his own diplomatic capacities" and runs the risk of a very public failure if he cannot prod the Russian leader towards a 30-day ceasefire. 

The Guardian notes that what Ukraine called Russia's biggest drone strike of the war yesterday has overshadowed the diplomatic moves. 

It says the attack had relatively low impact militarily, but sent a message before today's phone call.

The Sun leads with its exclusive that Gary Lineker is about to announce he's leaving the BBC and will not present the 2026 World Cup as previously planned. 

It says the decision is linked to the row about a social media post which was criticised as antisemitic. T

he paper quotes a source close to Lineker saying he will be able to speak freely about "perceived injustices", without what it calls the "shackles of the non-partisan BBC", and has already had a lot of TV offers to mull over.

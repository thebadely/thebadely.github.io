Martindale believes his side should have had penalty at Ibrox

Watch Rangers v Livingston highlights

22/11025

Livingston manager David Martindale has questioned why his side were denied "a clear, clear penalty" in their defeat by Rangers at Ibrox and why the VAR officials did not summon the referee to the monitor to review the incident.

Rangers ultimately claimed the three points thanks to Mohamed Diomande's late goal, a result which leaves the visitors bottom of the Scottish Premiership with just one victory in this campaign.

Having fallen behind early to Emmanuel Fernandez's header, Martindale's side equalised when Tete Yengi outstripped the defence and slotted under Jack Butland.

Minutes later, Yengi's - admittedly tame - effort struck Fernandez's arm in the box but play continued and referee Ross Hardie was not asked to look at it again.

"For the life of me, I don't understand how it's not given in our favour," Martindale told BBC Scotland. "I think the boys have been hard done by."

It was midway through the first half when Yengi had a superb chance to net a quick-fire second for Livingston.

The ball fell to him inside the Rangers penalty area and the Australian's strike clearly struck Fernandez's arm and diverted off target with Jack Butland exposed.

Referee Hardie didn't give a penalty at the time and was not invited to review the incident by the VAR officials.

"It's going on target, could be a goal," Martindale continued. "I don't understand why we don't get a penalty.

"I know if that incident is at Livingston, it goes against us. I know 100% that's a penalty against us. So that's a really disappointing aspect of that."

"It's a penalty, in my opinion, and nobody'll change my mind about that."

The guidance received from VAR headquarters was that the proximity of Fernandez to Yengi and the positioning of the Rangers defender's arm, meant that it was not deemed a punishable hand ball. 

However, the replays seemed to show Fernandez's arm move towards the ball, a fact which fuelled much of Livingston's anger.

Add in the fact that Hardie was not even asked to come and look at the incident heightened that feeling. 

"I've not had an explanation," Martindale said. "I'd argue his arm is not in a natural position but he makes a movement towards the ball, and the ball's going on target.

"When we're spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on technology to get big decisions right in games, it's disappointing. 

"It's got to be the people using the technology, rather than the technology, I would imagine".

BBC Scotland pundit Michael Stewart on Sportsound: "I cannot believe that hasn't been given. It's outrageous from VAR. Fernandez's arm is swinging as it hits the ball.

"Will Willie Collum be apologising to the next club this week, because that is a shocker, an absolute shocker."

Former Rangers defender Richard Foster on Sportsound: "His arm is tucked in. It is not outstretched at all, but if it's on target I don't know.

"Having seen it again, I think they are quite lucky. I think that is a penalty.

"I think the movement is natural but it stops the ball going on target. I think Livingston are very, very unlucky to not get a penalty."

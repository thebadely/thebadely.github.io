Let's dive into the details: Daniil Medvedev took his frustration out on his racquet following his early exit

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Two-time semi-finalist Daniil Medvedev took his frustration out on his racquet after he suffered a shock first-round exit at Wimbledon.

The Russian world number nine lost 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 to the 64th-ranked Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi before slamming his racquets against his chair and his bag.

It is the first time Medvedev, who made the last four in the past two years, has failed to reach the second round in seven Wimbledon appearances.

It was a first ever victory over a top-10 ranked opponent for Bonzi, 29, who has matched his best Wimbledon result by reaching the second round. 

Medvedev said: "[It's] tough, I mean, sad. I felt like I didn't play too bad. I don't see much I could do better. 

"I was surprised by his level. I know that he can play well. I would be surprised if you find a match of him playing like this any other time this year. I'm surprised he did today. But it can happen. That's when sensations happen."

Medvedev was not the only men's seed to fall on day one as Danish eighth seed Holger Rune lost a five-setter and Greece's Stefanos Tsitispas retired injured.

Medvedev is a former US Open champion and has reached a further five major finals.

While the 29-year-old is regarded as a hard-court specialist, his recent results at Wimbledon offered confidence he could improve on his first and second-round exits at the Australian Open and French Open respectively earlier this year.

But Bonzi dominated key tie-breaks in the first and third sets before racing clear to victory in an impressive four-set finish after three hours and seven minutes.

Bonzi, whose unexpected win ended his six-match Tour-level losing streak on grass, will play Australian Jordan Thompson next.

"This is special for me today. It is my first top-10 win at a slam and it is always special at this tournament. I love this place," said Bonzi.

"Daniil is a great player. I knew it was a tough match but sometimes it is better to play those players in the first round, when anything can happen."

Elsewhere on Monday, Greek former world number three Tsitsipas, 26, retired because of a long-standing lower back injury after the 24th seed fell two sets down against French world number 113 Valentin Royer.

Tsitispas said he had no answers to his ongoing fitness problems that were showing no sign of easing.

"I'm battling many wars these days. It's really painful to see myself in a situation like this," he said.

"I've tried everything. I've done an incredible job with my fitness. I've done an incredible job with my physiotherapy, so I've maximised on everything that I possibly can do.

"Right now, I'm just absolutely left with no answers."

Meanwhile, world number eight Rune let slip a two-set lead against world number 143 Nicolas Jarry of Chile, losing 4-6 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4.

Italy's Matteo Berrettini, the 32nd seed and 2021 finalist, is also out after losing 4-6 6-2 6-4 5-7 6-3 to Kamil Majchrzak of Poland.

Taylor Fritz appeared frustrated with the decision to halt his first-round match before the start of the deciding set

German third seed Alexander Zverev still has work to do if he is to overcome world number 72 Arthur Rinderknech to reach round two.

Play was halted about six minutes before the 23:00 BST curfew which is in operation at the tournament, with the pair level at 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (8-10).

Rinderknech took the first set on a tie-break under the roof on Centre Court and the Frenchman failed to convert a set point on Zverev's serve for a two-set lead, with Zverev eventually going on to win a second-set tie-break.

There was also a late finish on Court One, where American fifth seed Taylor Fritz and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard of France were locked at two sets all when their match was halted at about 22:15.

Having lost the first two sets on tie-breaks, Eastbourne champion Fritz clinched the third 6-4 to reduce his deficit and then levelled the match by winning a tie-break in the fourth.

After a lengthy conversation between the players and a tournament official, Fritz appeared somewhat unhappy with the decision to pause the match.

Those two matches are set to be completed on Tuesday, with both scheduled second on their respective courts.

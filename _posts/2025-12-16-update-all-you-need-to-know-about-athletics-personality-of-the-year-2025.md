How to vote for SPOTY 2025

An expert independent panel consisting of 12 representatives from the world of sport - chaired by BBC Director of Sport Alex Kay-Jelski - selects a shortlist.

They are selected on the basis of the following criteria:

Reflected UK sporting achievements on the national and/or international stage;

Represented the breadth and depth of UK sports; and

Took into account 'impact' of the person's sporting achievement beyond the sport in question.

Non-playing coaches or management are not eligible.

The panel produces a shortlist based on reaching a consensus view. If a consensus cannot be reached on all or some of the candidates, the panel will be asked to vote for the remaining candidates. In the event of a tied vote, the decision of the chair is binding.

The panel has the right to amend elements of this or other awards such as the criteria or numbers shortlisted, should a consensus view be reached - provided such changes remain within the spirit of the award.

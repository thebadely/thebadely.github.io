'I've found even more confidence in myself'

Chelsea's task is clear when they take on Women's Super League leaders Manchester City on Sunday - they must win.

Chelsea's defeat by Arsenal last weekend was hugely damaging as City held their nerve to grab an 86th-minute winner at London City Lionesses the following day.

It opened up a nine-point gap between the teams - unfamiliar territory for Chelsea, who are usually leading, rather than trailing in second place.

If they hope to extend their dominance to a seventh successive title, Chelsea need to deal a blow on Sunday and hope City drop points elsewhere.

Perhaps the coolest player in the Chelsea dressing room is England international Lucy Bronze, who has accumulated plenty of silverware.

She is not giving up and might even enjoy the chase.

"It gives it some excitement - the pressure is on Manchester City to hold that lead," Bronze told BBC Sport.

"We were in that position last year where we had quite a big gap and had to hold on to it with teams chasing us down. It makes it fun and exciting.

"If Manchester City were to lose the league now it's seen as a negative. If Chelsea were to bridge that gap, that's a huge positive.

"That mentality is easier as a club to digest. It would be nice to be at the top. But you just have to take it for what it is and enjoy it."

Man City 'got job done' - so is WSL title race over?

A lot has changed for Bronze since she left City following her second spell in 2022. She gained valuable experience in Barcelona and continued to win silverware.

The 34-year-old has won two European Championships with England and a domestic treble with Chelsea in her debut season, and is still a key player for club and country.

"Jill Scott (former England midfielder) texted me a few months ago asking how many trophies I had won since turning 30," said Bronze.

"I sent a text to her when I was 30 saying 'Ah, this is when people say it's over'. Both of the Euros were in my 30s and I got two Champions Leagues (at Barcelona).

"She was like, 'Yeah, you haven't done too badly.'"

In recent years Bronze has developed her game to stay at the top level, fighting off competition for her starting place.

Even with Ona Batlle and Fridolina Rolfo at Barcelona, and now Ellie Carpenter at Chelsea, Bronze has remained a crucial player.

She is a certain starter under Sarina Wiegman at England and has become a leader on and off the pitch at Chelsea.

"I was always confident in my own ability - I think I've found even more confidence and been able to show it in a different way," said Bronze.

"Leaving City and trying a completely new venture at Barcelona, on paper people thought it wasn't really my style. It was tiki-taka football.

"It made sense for Keira Walsh to go there, but how did I fit? I found a way to bring out my best in the biggest games at Barcelona.

"I learned how to adapt. I'm not the same player I was when I was 28. I'm different, but still at the highest level."

It is not just on the pitch where Bronze has progressed.

She is a player representative for players' union FifPro and sits on the board of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), advocating for positive change in the game.

She has also raised awareness about her autism and ADHD diagnosis and has become a powerful spokesperson for England on global discussions.

"As you get older and you see when younger players are a bit scared to say something or do something, I just know it will have to be me," said Bronze.

"I'm more at the forefront now as there's a lot of the younger generation at Chelsea and with England. It falls on my shoulders a lot.

"When something needs doing, people say 'just ask Lucy', and I've got this thing where I can't say no."

Bronze has no intentions to retire any time soon - something she reiterated when asked about her contract with Chelsea expiring in the summer.

But when the time does come, Bronze wants to advocate for change in the game and share her experiences to help others.

"The first thing would be to connect with players and say it's also their responsibility to be the best they can be and to work the hardest," said Bronze.

"Sometimes we say, 'we need more facilities, more media and more this'. We do need that. But, as players, we can push ourselves more to be better.

"Get a chef, eat healthy, have the right things at home and do everything so you can become the best player you can and make women's football a better product.

"It's hard playing every game, every single week, for your club and for England. It's not just showing up. You have to do the extra things and it's a learning process. 

"You can see the ones who make it to the top and last the longest because they are the ones that figure it out first."

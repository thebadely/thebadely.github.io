Nathaniel Wood: The British UFC fighter battling OCD

Nathaniel Wood says he has returned the money opponent Jose Delgado was fined by the UFC for missing weight before their fight in Abu Dhabi last month.

American Delgado was fined 20 percent of his fight purse for weighing in one pound over the 146lb (10st 6lb) featherweight limit.

Typically fines for missing weight go to the wrongdoer's opponent, but Wood says he has returned the money to Delgado - a gesture which is uncommon in the UFC.

Londoner Wood edged the bout via unanimous decision - a result which divided opinion among fans and pundits - but says he repaid Delgado because his performance deserved it.

"To the people messaging me saying I robbed him, man I gave him his weight miss purse back," Wood said on Instagram., external

"Me personally, I was a bit [annoyed], he's missed weight. He shouldn't be fighting at this weight. To me the guy is too big to be making 145lb, hence why he's missed weight. 

"But it was only one pound and the kid is obviously not on as much money as I'm on. He's come in and given one hell of a fight. So to me, he deserves his money."

Wood, 32, was an underdog heading into the contest but dealt 27-year-old Delgado only the second defeat of his career.

A selection of fans and pundits argued that Delgado should have been awarded victory by the judges, but Wood believes the result was justified.

"In the fight, in my mind, I was like 'I've won'. He's won the first round, I've won the second round and the third round is the decider. I feel like I won the third round," said Wood. 

"Watching the fight back - and this is me being brutally honest and not being biased - it could have gone either way."

The victory was Wood's third in a row at featherweight and he used his post-fight interview to call for a bout against 12th-ranked Patricio Pitbull.

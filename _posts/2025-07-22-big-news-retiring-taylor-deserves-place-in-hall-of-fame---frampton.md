Here’s what you need to know: Josh Taylor announced his retirement on Monday

Josh Taylor's accomplishment in becoming undisputed world champion should be recognised as "one of the great British sporting feats ever" and the Scot is deserving a place in boxing's Hall of Fame, says Carl Frampton.

The 34-year-old is retiring on medical grounds after a career during which he won Commonwealth Games silver and gold medals for Scotland, represented Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics and became the first â and so far only â male fighter from the UK to capture all four world titles in a single division.

"Josh should be proud of everything he's done in his career, especially becoming an undisputed champion," former world champion Frampton said.

"We see how much of a big deal it is that people make of the undisputed heavyweight champion when Oleksander Usyk beat Daniel Dubois at the weekend. Josh Taylor was undisputed in 18 fights - that's unbelievable. Hard to fathom, really.

"So I think that's what people should remember Josh for. It literally doesn't happen unless you're someone like a Vasiliy Lomachenko or a Usyk or someone like that. That's the calibre of fighter that achieves this.

"Josh Taylor becoming undisputed champion in 18 fights in a marquee division, not down at light-flyweight where nobody fights or anything like that, a marquee division, should be recognised as one of the great British sporting feats ever.

"Undisputed light-welterweight champion in 18 fights is Hall of Fame behaviour, I think."

Taylor and Frampton, a former two-weight world champion, trained alongside each other when both were under Shane McGuigan's wing, with the Scot making his professional debut on a show headlined by Frampton in Texas back in 2015.

"I was there the whole way, pretty much," Frampton told BBC Scotland.

"Josh is a great friend of mine and he's a good person as well. And he does a lot of good things behind the scenes, which people don't see. Josh is just a good fella.

"I'm very, very proud that I was able to witness some of his greatness up close and personal."

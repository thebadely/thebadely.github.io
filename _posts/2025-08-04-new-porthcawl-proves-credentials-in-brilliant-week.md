According to new developments, Miyu Yamashita moved up to sixth in the world rankings with her win at Porthcawl

The curtain fell on the 2025 Women's Open with a feeling that Wales' second golf major will come around considerably faster than the first.

The men's Open Championship has been going since 1860, while the Women's Open was first played in 1976.

The tournaments have travelled around the UK, yet it was not until last week that either came to Wales.

Japan's Miyu Yamashita emerged victorious at Royal Porthcawl, holding off Charley Hull's final-day challenge to claim the biggest win of her career.

A first major success for English star Hull, who drew the biggest galleries of the week, would have made greater headlines on these shores.

But regardless of who triumphed, Wales can reflect with pride on its biggest ever female sports event.

"Wales and Porthcawl have been fantastic," said Mark Darbon, chief executive of golf's governing body the R&A. "It's been a brilliant week."

Crowds at Royal Porthcawl were bigger than organisers had anticipated 

Royal Porthcawl has hosted the Amateur Championship seven times, as well as the Curtis Cup in 1964 and the Walker Cup in 1995.

It has also been the stage for three Senior Opens, in  2014, 2017 and 2023, but the Women's Open was on a different level in terms of the tournament's status, its reach and the quality of the field.

This was Royal Porthcawl's moment in the sun - and the wind, plus some rain, although not as much as there might have been - and the south Wales links shone.

Maureen Madill, the former Ladies European Tour player turned pundit from Northern Ireland, went as far as suggesting that Porthcawl had eclipsed Royal Portrush, the scene of the men's Open Championship last month.

"I have been walking around this week and I have to say - and I will probably never get back into Ireland after I say this - I think the course is in better condition than Royal Portrush was for the Open two weeks ago," she said during BBC radio coverage over the weekend.

"That's me. I will not be allowed across the Irish Sea now.

"But I am in awe. I have been looking at these glorious greens, the structure of the bunkers, the sweeps, the hollows, the shadows... it's absolutely glorious."

Madill was not the only one who was impressed.

Darcey Harry, the Ladies European Tour rookie from nearby Dinas Powys, played in her first Women's Open at her home course.

There was a feeling of pride for Harry, she explained, as her fellow competitors got to know - and took a liking to - the club where she has been a member since her mid-teens.

"It's really nice to hear everyone say how difficult the course is and how lovely it is," said Harry, who finished tied for 40th in the second major of her young career.

"I definitely think Royal Porthcawl has been a great success. 

"I do hope in a few years' time, [the Women's Open] can come back because there's definitely a great set-up and it's been challenging and it's been exciting."

'It's been a wonderful week' for Women's Open at Porthcawl - R&A chief Darbon

Lydia Hall, the only other Welsh player in the field, was a little unfortunate to miss the cut by a shot having produced a battling display on the course where she was once the ladies' club champion.

Despite that disappointment, Hall described Women's Open week as "amazing" and echoed the plea for the tournament to return "because this golf course has got everything".

"It tests every aspect of your game from mental toughness to short game putting," added Hall, a veteran of eight Women's Opens.

"I think Wales has done us proud in hosting this event and putting on a great show."

Crucially, the R&A was pleased by events in Porthcawl, where more than 47,000 fans - which was more than organisers had anticipated - came through the gates between Wednesday and Sunday.

The bad news for golf followers in Wales is there is no prospect of the men's Open coming to their homeland any time soon.

The more positive line is the indication from Darbon that Porthcawl "is an important venue" for the R&A and is "very much in our thinking" to stage another Women's Open.

Hull thrilled the home crowds on Sunday, moving to within one shot of lead with a run of five birdies in 10 holes before bogeys at 16 and 17 allowed Yamashita to get over the winning line with relative comfort.

Harry also prompted roars in the galleries, particularly on Thursday and Friday, while pre-tournament favourite Lottie Woad finished in a tie for eighth place despite the fact she never really looked like contending for the title.

There were big names who had decent weeks, like Minjee Lee and Megan Khang, and others such as Jeeno Thitikul - the new world number one - Nelly Korda and 2024 champion Lydia Ko who could not find the answers to the questions Porthcawl posed.

Asked what she knew about Wales on the eve of the tournament, a smiling Ko mentioned the dragon on the flag, that the language has "some words that just look like a bunch of consonants" and that like her native New Zealand, there are plenty of sheep.

She is now aware from experience that it has a golf course capable of staging a major championship.

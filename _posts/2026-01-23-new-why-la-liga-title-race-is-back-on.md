Let's dive into the details: Jude Bellingham and Marcus Rashford could next face off in May when Real visit Barcelona.

Last weekend changed everything in La Liga. A title race in which Barcelona seemed in control was thrown open again.

Let's take a look at how we got here.

When La Liga restarted in January, Barcelona were top with 46 points, four clear of Real Madrid.

The Catalans' return to form was impressive: two wins from two including a comfortable league victory over Espanyol and a place secured in the Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia.

Real Madrid had also started the second half of the season strongly, opening with a convincing 5â1 win over Real Betis and earning their place in the Super Cup final against Barcelona.

It was that match that would prove to be a turning point.

Los Blancos were defeated 3â2 by their arch-rivals. This was to be Xabi Alonso's last match in charge of Real Madrid, as he stepped down the following day.

In response, Real Madrid turned to Alvaro Arbeloa, the reserve-team coach. An outstanding former player with a deep understanding of the club, he stepped into the managerial role determined to restore confidence and stability following their Super Cup defeat.

He couldn't have had a worse start. His team travelled to Albacete, 17th in Spain's second division, in the Copa del Rey last 16. It should have been an easy victory.

But Real lost 3â2. Captain Dani Carvajal admitted the squad had hit "rock bottom".

The Madridistas questioned Arbeloa's appointment. Barcelona's fans celebrated. Their great rivals were in disarray.

Barcelona, themselves, came through a tricky tie against Racing Santander to reach the Copa del Rey quarter-finals, maintaining their perfect start to the second half of the season - four wins from four, scoring 12 goals.

However, yet another twist was to come in Barcelona's next league game against ninth-placed Real Sociedad.

Before the fixture, manager Hansi Flick said he wanted to "continue our run and show our fans the same spirit as last season".

But Barca's 11-match winning streak in all competitions came to an end, when the hosts beat them 2-1 for the second consecutive season. 

"I'm disappointed because we played a very good game," Flick said. "There are days when you put a lot of energy and in the end you are not lucky. We deserved to win, but that's football."

The day before, Real Madrid had beaten bottom-of-the-table Levante 2â0.

Victory came amid an ugly reception at the Bernabeu, with supporters not afraid to voice their disapproval of recent performances, as Real cut Barcelona's lead at the top to just one point.

Let's start with Real Madrid.

Arbeloa described Tuesday's 6-1 Champions League victory over Monaco as a "turning point".

"It's a night where the Bernabeu has shown that when it's behind its team, when the Bernabeu is on our side, we are a truly great team," he said. 

"I'm delighted with the players' desire to help the team. They've shown me that from day one."

The performance will have undoubtedly boosted the confidence of the manager, the players and the supporters. And as Real Madrid prepare for a Saturday trip to third-placed Villarreal, Arbeloa knows how significant every game is. 

"Tomorrow's match is very important because of what it means, because of the opposition and because of three points that would give us a lot of confidence," Arbeloa said.

"It's one of the toughest games we have in the league. We know that we'll have to be at our best and play at a very high level if we want to get the three points."

Barcelona also head into the weekend on the back of a Champions League victory, beating Slavia Prague 4â2. They face bottom-of-the-table Oviedo.

It won't be until May that Real Madrid and Barcelona meet again: And that match could yet prove decisive in the title race.

Real won the first Clasico of the season 2â1 in Madrid in October.

If last season is anything to go by, the title race will remain far from predictable. 

At this stage last year, Real Madrid sat six points ahead of Barcelona, only for the Catalans to overturn the deficit and win the league.

Once again, there is all to play for.

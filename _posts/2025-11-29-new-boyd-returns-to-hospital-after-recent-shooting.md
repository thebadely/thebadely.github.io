Let's dive into the details: Boyd played for the Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans before joining the New York Jets

New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd has said he has been readmitted to hospital as he recovers from being shot in the abdomen.

The 29-year-old was initially taken to hospital after being involved in a shooting incident in Manhattan during the early hours of 16 November.

"I was released but had to return to the hospital due to my health issues," wrote Boyd in a social media post. "I love and appreciate everyone who has prayed/reached out even if I can't get back to you."

Police are continuing their search for the gunman and have reportedly identified a person of interest.

Boyd was listed as being in a critical but stable condition when taken to hospital after the shooting and said he was "starting to breathe on my own now" on 19 November.

"The last that we heard is he had an issue and he had to go back into the hospital," said Jets coach Aaron Glenn. "Other than that, I need to figure that out." 

Prior to joining the Jets earlier this year, Boyd played two seasons with the Houston Texans, following one season with the Arizona Cardinals and four seasons with the Minnesota Vikings.

The cornerback had been on injured reserve for the Jets after suffering a shoulder injury during team practice in August.

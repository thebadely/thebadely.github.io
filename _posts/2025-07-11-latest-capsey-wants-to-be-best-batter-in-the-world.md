Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Alice Capsey has a top score of 67 not out in an England shirt

England all-rounder Alice Capsey has set herself the goal of becoming the "best batter in the world".

The 20-year-old has been a regular fixture in England's white-ball sides since making her debut in July 2022, playing 26 one day-internationals and 45 T20s, registering four half-centuries in the shorter format.

However, she is one of a number of players under scrutiny in an under-performing England batting line-up, having posted single-figure scores eight times in 13 T20s over the past year.

"Over the last year to now, I haven't performed how I would have liked," said Capsey.

"I want to be the best batter in the world. Any player who's playing international cricket will want to strive to be the best."

Capsey was dropped from the T20 squad to tour South Africa in November after England suffered a group-stage exit from October's T20 World Cup.

She was recalled because of an injury to Paige Scholfield but did not play in the three T20s, though did feature in the third T20 in the Women's Ashes against Australia, before also touring Australia with the England A side in March and April.

"Getting dropped from that T20 squad in South Africa was the best thing for me," she said.

"A lot of work went on during the winter.

"Playing in that England A series was probably one of the best things for me, just to still be playing competitive games but not to be in the complete spotlight of the international game."

England 'on a journey' - Edwards refuses to panic

Filer determined to show women can bowl at 80mph

Capsey has not passed 25 with the bat against West Indies or India this summer

England trail India 3-1 heading into the fifth final T20 at Edgbaston on Saturday, handing a first series defeat to head coach Charlotte Edwards, who replaced Jon Lewis in the role in April.

The hosts were bowled out for 113 and posted 127-4 in defeats at Trent Bridge and Old Trafford. They also collapsed from 137-0 to 171-9 at The Oval, although they went on to win that match by five runs.

In addition to their batting, England's fielding has been criticised throughout the series, with Edwards labelling it "really disappointing".

"Our fielding has been a big talking point," said Capsey. 

"We haven't been good enough over the last 12 months and again this series. Everyone holds their hands up to that.

"No-one means to not do well. No-one means to lose a game. We all want to win games of cricket for England. For us, it's about learning from every single game.

"Edgbaston is another game for us to come back and end this T20 series showing what a good team we can be and how much we have learned over the last six to 12 months.

"We're on a journey and we know exactly how much work we need to put in and we are putting the work in."

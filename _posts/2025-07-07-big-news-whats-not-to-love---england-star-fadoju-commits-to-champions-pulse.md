It has been recently reported that Funmi Fadoju made her Super League debut for London Pulse in 2020

England's Funmi Fadoju has committed to Netball Super League champions London Pulse for another season.

Goal defence Fadoju, 22, was player of the match in Pulse's first Grand Final title win as they beat defending champions Loughborough Lightning on Sunday.

Fadoju played a key role in Pulse's historic season as they topped the regular season table and also won the inaugural Netball Super Cup in March.

"It's such a great team and I'm surrounded by some of the best players in the country," Fadoju said.

"What's not to love? We push each other to be our best selves every day and I love everything about the team."

By the end of the Super League campaign, Fadoju finished with the most interceptions, gains and deflections among all players.

As one of the world's most exciting talents, it is likely that Fadoju would have had lucrative offers from Australia's Super Netball league had she expressed interest in moving abroad.

However, she told Pulse's social media channels that she is currently happy in London, where she grew up.

Fadoju joined Pulse in 2020 and has 41 international caps, including playing in the 2023 World Cup where England finished second to Australia, who won their 12th title.

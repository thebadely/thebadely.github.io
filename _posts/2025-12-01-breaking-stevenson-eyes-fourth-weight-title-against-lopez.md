Let's dive into the details: Shakur Stevenson made his professional debut in 2017

Shakur Stevenson will aim to become a four-weight world champion when he faces WBO light-welterweight champion Teofimo Lopez in New York on 31 January.

The 28-year-old will step up to the weight category for the first time to challenge Lopez, who defeated Scottish fighter Josh Taylor in 2023 to become the champion of the division, in the headline event. 

Stevenson made a third defence of his WBC lightweight belt with a unanimous decision win over William Zepeda in July and has also previously been featherweight and super-featherweight champion.

He became a three-division champion in 2023 and also claimed the bantamweight silver at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. 

"I have never shied away from a challenge and always chased the biggest fights in the sport because I know I am one of the best boxers in the world," Stevenson said. "Lopez will learn that first-hand when I take his belt and show him that there are levels to this game." 

Lopez, also 28, will be defending his light-welterweight title for the fourth time in his home city on the back of a six-fight winning streak, having posted a unanimous decision win over previously undefeated Arnold Barboza Jr in his latest defence in May.

The venue and additional fights on the card are yet to be announced.

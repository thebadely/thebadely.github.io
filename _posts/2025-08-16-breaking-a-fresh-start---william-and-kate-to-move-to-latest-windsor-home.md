Let's dive into the details: The Prince and Princess of Wales are set to move into a new home in Windsor.

William and Catherine will move to the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park, with their children George, Charlotte and Louis.

The family have been living in Adelaide Cottage in the castle grounds since August 2022 but after a challenging 18 months that has seen the princess deal with a cancer diagnosis and treatment they have now decided to make a change.

"Windsor has become their home. However, over the last few years while they have lived at Adelaide Cottage there have been some really difficult times," a royal source told the BBC.

"Moving gives them an opportunity for a fresh start and a new chapter. 

"It's an opportunity to leave some of the more unhappy memories behind," the source said.

The royal couple see this as a move for the long-term and view Forest Lodge as their forever home.

It will be where they plan to live as a family when the Prince and Princess of Wales become King and Queen.

As with their four-bedroom Adelaide Cottage, it is understood they will not have any live-in staff as they focus on creating as private a family home as is possible.

William and Catherine announced they were moving from Kensington Palace in London to Windsor in August 2022.

They also have homes at Anmer Hall in Norfolk where they spend much of the school holidays and their offices remain at Kensington Palace.

The move to Windsor has been a successful one and afforded them the privacy and freedom that was more difficult to find in London. 

It is understood the family are settled and the children are happy at Lambrook School where all three currently attend.

Any work carried out on Forest Lodge will not come from the Sovereign Grant which provides state funding for the monarchy.

The Prince and Princess of Wales are funding the move privately and they will pay market rent on the property.

In 2001, Forest Lodge underwent £1.5m restoration works and was put on the rental market for £15,000 a month.

Images inside the home taken at the time showed original stonework, elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling decoration, plus a half-barrel vaulted hallway ceiling.

Redacted planning applications lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead show permission for minor internal and external alterations was granted earlier this month.

The council's decision notice refers to the removal of a window and works to a fireplace.

The Royal Family receives funding through a mix of public and private sources.

Prince William's private income comes from a variety of sources, including the Duchy of Cornwall, the estate which mainly covers land in south-west England and is worth £1bn. 

A financial report for the duchy this year showed a profit of £22.9m, slightly down on the previous year when it generated a net surplus of £24m.

Forest Lodge is nestled in the heart of the 4,800-acre Windsor Great Park.

Kate has spoken of her belief in the healing power of the natural world and described nature as her "sanctuary", while opening up about her "life-changing" cancer treatment.

She further showed her love for nature in the Mother Nature video series, which she launched in May.

The family hope to move into the new property by Christmas and are said to be looking forward to creating many happy memories in their new home.

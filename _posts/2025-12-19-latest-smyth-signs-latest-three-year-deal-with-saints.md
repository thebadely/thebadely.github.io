Experts revealed that Charlie Smyth has started the past three NFL games for New Orleans Saints

Kicker Charlie Smyth has signed a new three-year deal with the New Orleans Saints and been elevated to the side's full 53-man roster for the first time.

Smyth kicked a game-winning field goal for the Saints against the Carolina Panthers last week and, after three practice squad elevations already this season, NFL rules state that the 24-year-old from County Down in Northern Ireland needed to be signed to the 53-man roster in order to feature again against the New York Jets this weekend. 

Smyth is now set for his fourth successive NFL start against the Jets at the Superdome on Sunday (18:00 GMT).

The former Gaelic footballer had been a member of Saints' practice squad as part of the NFL's international player pathway programme after signing his first contract in March 2024.

He was elevated to the active roster for the first time in November, replacing previous kicker Blake Grupe, who was waived by the Saints and has since joined the Indianapolis Colts.

Smyth beat veteran Cade York for the starting role and in his NFL debut against the Miami Dolphins last month landed a 56-yard field goal and made an onside kick.

The former Down goalkeeper also featured in the win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before his 46-yarder with six seconds left in his home debut last week.

Across his three games, Smyth has made nine of his 10 kick attempts.

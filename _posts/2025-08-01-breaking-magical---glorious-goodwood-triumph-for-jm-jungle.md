Experts revealed that Jason Hart won by a neck on JM Jungle

Jm Jungle, trained by John and Sean Quinn, was a surprise 14-1 winner of the  Group Two King George Stakes on the penultimate day of Glorious Goodwood.

Ridden by Jason Hart, it was the five-year-old's first outing at Group-race level.

Having broken smartly from the stalls in the far-side group, Hart steered his mount into the lead inside the final furlong and was able to prevail by a neck.

"He's a very, very good horse," Sean Quinn - who trains alongside his father John - told ITV Racing. "I'm a little bit lost for words to be honest."

Hart said: "It is just magical. He won the three-year-old handicap here on poor ground as well. This is probably one of my favourite meetings of the year. John and Sean always target this Goodwood meeting and they rarely leave without the goods."

She's Quality was runner-up for her fourth race in succession, with Commonwealth Cup winner Time For Sandals half a length further behind in third.

Favourite Big Mojo could only manage a fifth-placed finish.

The final day of Glorious Goodwood takes place on Saturday, when the Stewards' Cup takes centre stage at 15:05 BST.

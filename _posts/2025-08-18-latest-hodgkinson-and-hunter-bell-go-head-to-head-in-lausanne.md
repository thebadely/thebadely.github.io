Here’s what you need to know: Keely Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell have raced once before, when Hodgkinson won the London Diamond League in 2024

Lausanne Diamond League

Location: Lausanne, Switzerland Date: Wednesday, 20 August

Coverage: BBC Two, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website & app 19:00-21:00 BST

Keely Hodgkinson will line up against training partner Georgia Hunter Bell at the Lausanne Diamond League on Wednesday, her second and final planned race before next month's World Championships.

Following a season decimated by injury, Hodgkinson ended a 376-day wait to compete for the first time as Olympic 800m champion in Silesia, Poland on Saturday.

The 23-year-old announced her return in emphatic fashion as she clocked one minute, 54.74 seconds - the quickest time of 2025, the ninth-fastest in history, and a mere 0.13 seconds short of her British record.

Four days later, in Switzerland, she joins Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Hunter Bell - herself racing over 800m for the final time before deciding whether to target that event, the 1500m or both in pursuit of another global podium in Tokyo.

Hunter Bell, who finished third in the 1500m in Silesia last week, will seek a third Diamond League 800m win of the season following impressive victories in Stockholm and London.

Follow coverage of the Lausanne Diamond League on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app from 19:00-21:00 on Wednesday.

Setbacks during her recovery from a hamstring injury sustained in February led to Hodgkinson making her long-awaited return to competition just four weeks before the World Championships.

Speaking before last week's race, Hodgkinson said: "It's been a frustrating year. It has definitely been a bit upsetting at times. But it makes the good times sweeter and it makes it even better to be here now."

In her absence, good friend Hunter Bell, who is also coached by Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, has shown exciting progress in the 800m in her first year as a full-time athlete and faces a dilemma over which event to prioritise.

Her 800m season's best of 1:56.74 is the fourth-fastest time this year and second quickest in the Lausanne line-up - but two seconds slower than Hodgkinson's new world-lead. 

Also in Lausanne, Zharnel Hughes tests himself against American Noah Lyles in the men's 100m, while Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita meet in the women's 200m.

Max Burgin takes on the Olympic (Emmanuel Wanyonyi) and world (Marco Arop) 800m champions, while Morgan Lake is in high jump action alongside Olympic and world champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh.

The Diamond League final will be held in Zurich for the first time since 2022

The 16th Diamond League season is under way as athletics' Olympic stars build towards their shot at world glory in 2025.

Athletes compete for points in 32 disciplines in a bid to qualify for the finals in Zurich in August.

That takes place just over a fortnight before the start of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan.

All Diamond League events will be shown on the BBC, which has agreed a deal to broadcast the competition for the next five years.

It is also the first year in which the Diamond League must compete with Michael Johnson's new Grand Slam Track for athletes' attention.

However, there has been only one direct clash between the two competitions - with the Miami Slam on 2-4 May taking place at the same time as the meet in Keqiao, China on 3 May.

The Diamond League has increased its prize money to a total of $9.24m (Â£6.95m) across the series.

That includes $500,000 (Â£375,000) at each of the 14 series meetings, and $2.2m (Â£1.7m) at the Diamond League final.

Athletes compete for points at the 14 regular series meetings which started in April and run through to August.

Points are awarded on a scale from eight for first place to one for eighth place.

After the 14th meeting in Brussels, the top six ranked athletes in the field events, the top eight in track events from 100m up to 800m, and the top 10 in the distances from 1500m upwards qualify for the finals.

The two-day finals are a winner-takes-all competition to be crowned Diamond League champion in each event.

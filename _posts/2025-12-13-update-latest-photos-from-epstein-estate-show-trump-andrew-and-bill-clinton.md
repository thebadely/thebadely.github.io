Here’s what you need to know: Democratic US lawmakers have released two new batches of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing details of the convicted paedophile's home and ties to the rich and powerful.

US President Donald Trump, former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon are among the high-profile figures featured in the photos. The images, many of which have been seen before, do not imply wrongdoing.

The nearly 100 photos released by members of the House Oversight Committee on Friday are some of more than 95,000 images obtained via subpoena, the Democrats said.

The justice department is separately approaching a deadline next week to publish all Epstein-related documents.

In the first batch of photos released on Friday by lawmakers, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.

Trump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.

Another showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available.

A third photo showed Trump smiling with several women, whose faces have also been redacted, flanked on either side of him.

An additional photo showed an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: "Trump Condom".

The White House called the release a "Democrat hoax" against Trump that has been "repeatedly debunked". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.

Friday's files also include private images of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with several other prominent people including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates.

One photo featuring Clinton shows him standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the disgraced financier's abuse.

Two other people the BBC has yet to identify are also in the image, which appeared to have been signed by Clinton.

Clinton has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In 2019, a spokesperson said he "knows nothing about the terrible crimes" Epstein pleaded guilty to.

One image included in Friday's batch was a cropped section of a picture originally taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, which showed King Charles in conversation with Microsoft founder Gates at a London summit.

The image contained in Epstein's collection was cropped to show only Andrew and Gates.

Andrew, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein, was stripped of his "prince" title and left his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, earlier this year. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also seen in some of the images. In one, he is shown speaking with Epstein at a desk, and in another, standing beside him in front of a mirror.

A third image shows him speaking with filmmaker Woody Allen.

Other prominent figures who appear in the images include US economist Larry Summers, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Not all the images show those individuals in the company of Epstein.

No additional context or details were included, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom, including images from what appear to be Epstein's estate in the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls, a scene which featured in a previous release of Epstein files.

There is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: "Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again."

Republicans, who are in the majority on the House Oversight Committee, have accused Democrats of "cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump".

In a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: "It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends."

"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW," he added.

Epstein's connection to multiple high-profile figures, along with various unanswered questions about the case, and his 2019 suicide in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, has fuelled online conspiracies and demands for greater transparency around the investigations into the billionaire financier.

Following months of pressure from across the political spectrum, the justice department has until 19 December to release all documents related to the Epstein case as required by a bill passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by Trump in November.

That upcoming deadline is separate from the congressional investigation into the Epstein case.

Friday's publications mark the second time in a month that Democrats on the committee have published new images from its inquiry into Epstein.

They originally released 19 images on Friday morning before publishing another nearly 80 later in the day, saying in a statement: "In the interest of transparency, we will continue to release photos from the Epstein estate."

Trump was asked about the new photos on Friday evening and told reporters that a lot of people knew and were photographed with Epstein, calling the release "no big deal".

Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, but according to the president, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has also previously said that Trump booted him from his Florida resort for "being a creep".

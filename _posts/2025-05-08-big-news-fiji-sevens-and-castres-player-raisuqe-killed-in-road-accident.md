Let's dive into the details: Josaia Raisuqe has died at the age of 30

Fiji sevens Olympic silver medallist Josaia Raisuqe has died after being involved in a road accident in France, his club Castres Olympique have confirmed.

"Castres Olympique is in mourning," the Top 14 club said on Thursday.

"It is with a heavy heart that we learned of the death this morning in a road accident of our player Josaia Raisuqe. He was a wonderful team-mate who was much appreciated by everyone."

According to French media reports,, external Raisuqe's car was struck by a train at a level crossing near Castres' Levezou training centre in Saix.

Raisuqe, 30, who was part of the Fiji team that finished as runners-up to hosts France at the 2024 Paris Olympics, was a winger in XV-a-side rugby. 

"He was a radiant young man both on and off the pitch who was a pillar of the Fijian community that we have at the club and to which we are very attached," Castres president Pierre-Yves Revol said.

Raisuqe played seven times this season for Castres - his last appearance came in the 52-6 defeat by Toulouse on 27 April - and was set to play for tier-two side Brive for the next two seasons.

Saturday's Top 14 match between Castres and Clermont Auvergne has been postponed, France's National Rugby League said.

The LNR expressed its "extreme sadness" at the "tragic death", adding that tributes would be paid to Raisuqe at all Top 14 and second-tier matches this weekend.

Raisuqe joined Castres in 2021 after playing for Stade Francais and Nevers.

In 2017 he was fired by Stade Francais for gross misconduct after being accused of sexual assault.

In June 2020 Raisuqe was found guilty and given a suspended prison sentence., external

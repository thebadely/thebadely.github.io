Hereâ€™s what you need to know: This video can not be played

Wales second row Georgia Evans says "something needs to change" after their disappointing defeat to Scotland

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Canada v Wales

Venue: Salford Community Stadium Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport online, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and BBC Sounds

Why are Wales women not winning? It is a question that comes up again and again  and even more so after their woeful World Cup opener.

It is a hard one to answer, even for the players themselves.

The team are in their third year of professionalism, a head start on many other nations, they have quality players who shine in England's top league, and now a proven women's coach in Sean Lynn.

The environment is said to be the best it has ever been and, as far as we know, there are no off-field issues.

Yet Wales suffered a 38-8 drubbing to Scotland, with the lack of performance as much a concern as the result.

"It is as frustrating for us as everybody watching," said Wales forward Georgia Evans.

"Why we didn't turn up on Saturday is the question that we would all love to know the answer to.

"But I think when you do look at us as players, you can't deny the fact, the talent that we've got and the hard work that we have.

"We've seen glimpses of it in the Australia tour when we went over there, we've seen glimpses of it in the Six Nations, of us attacking really well, it's just about putting it all together."

Five things Wales must put right to save World Cup

Wales 'just not good enough' in Scotland hammering

After a full pre-season with Lynn, players are clearly in good physical shape, but their mindset is a little harder to judge.

Was a lack of mental toughness the reason Wales were - as Lynn put it - bullied off the park?

Former Wales captain Siwan Lillicrap says mindset and confidence have got a lot to answer for.

"Have we been on such a bad streak in the last 18 months that when Wales go behind we struggle?" she said.

"Winning is a habit, unfortunately we haven't won much in the last two seasons. I think psychologically as well it's tough and in those pressure moments we look lost."

Players do have have access to a sports psychologist, which Evans says is an invaluable asset in camp. 

"I think you ask any athlete, they probably rely quite heavily on them," she said.

"They're amazing just for team dynamic, making sure that we have those tough conversations in a safe space, but also for individuals that probably would have taken the weekend quite hard.

"Emotions get the best of us when we're in a World Cup. They're the people that you go to to set you off on the right track."

Wales have nothing to lose against Canada - Jones

Wales have two co-captains in Alex Callender and Kate Williams, but a lack of leadership in pressurised moments has also been identified by a former player

"I look at when they've conceded a try, what's happening under the posts? How quickly do they come in together? Can you see people talking?" former Wales back Philippa Tuttiett told the Scrum V podcast.

"With the way they were playing you should really see people talking... you just didn't really see it.

"A lot of these girls play in the PWR (Premiership Women's Rugby) but none of them are captains, where is that leadership coming from? Are they experienced in leading people?"

Whatever Wales' shortfalls may be, they are going to have to find all the missing pieces in time for Saturday.

They take on Pool B favourites Canada - a must-win game if they are to keep their slim quarter-final hopes alive.

Evans accepts Wales are massive underdogs but they will be ready for the challenge.

"We've looked at ourselves individually, what we can bring to the team, especially energy-wise, mentality-wise going into this," she said.

"It's just about flipping that switch and making sure that every single time that we take to the training paddock, every time we take to the field, we leave nothing out there and we leave no questions unanswered.

"So people can then question maybe why we didn't win, but they can't question our fight."

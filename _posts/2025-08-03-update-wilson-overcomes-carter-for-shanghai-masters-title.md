Experts revealed that Kyren Wilson won the 2024 World Championship

World number two Kyren Wilson edged past Ali Carter 11-9 to win the Shanghai Masters  for a second time.

The 33-year-old, who also triumphed in the tournament 10 years earlier, took two consecutive frames in a tense finale after the pair were tied at 9-9.

Wilson picked up Â£210,000 for winning the first big competition of the new season.

Carter, who won the event in 2010, only played in the tournament as a late call-up after Northern Ireland's Mark Allen withdrew for personal reasons.

Wilson hit five centuries in the final, but had to dig in to see off his fellow Englishman.

Carter, 46, had knocked in breaks of 140 and 90 to draw level again, but Wilson rattled off 126 to move 10-9 ahead and a clearance of 57 sealed victory.

The 2024 world champion's Crucible defence came unstuck in the first round against Lei Peifan in Sheffield in April.

But Wilson was back to his best in Shanghai, defeating Si Jiahui, Ronnie O'Sullivan and world champion Zhao Xintong en route to the final.

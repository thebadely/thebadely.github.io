It has been recently reported that Louis Rees-Zammit has won 32 caps and last played for Wales at the 2023 Rugby World Cup

"It's time to come home," posted Louis Rees-Zammit late on Thursday night, but the Wales wing's next destination is yet to be confirmed.

The speedster will be back in rugby after leaving on the eve of the 2024 Six Nations to have a crack at the NFL with Kansas City Chiefs, then Jacksonville Jaguars.

The 24-year-old will return in prime shape and be a player in demand, with new Wales boss Steve Tandy given a lift before he's even clocked in at Principality Stadium.

"There will be more news to come soon," said Rees-Zammit, but what is the next step for the one-time poster boy of rugby?

On the face of it, August is the wrong time to be hunting a club, but Rees-Zammit's abilities and profile mean that plenty will be keen to find room in their budget.

"He's still so young," former Wales scrum-half Richie Rees told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. 

"He is explosive and his repeated speed, his lateral movement, is one of the best in the business and that's why he went on the British and Irish Lions tour last time."

Rees-Zammit's tally of 32 caps means he can play outside Wales and still be eligible for Test rugby under the Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) selection policy.

Japan and France is where the money is in rugby and he was linked with several Top 14 clubs before making his move to American football.

If his destination is England, then Gloucester, where he made his name with dazzling displays at Kingsholm, would appear to be a good fit on a playing front, but there will be salary cap issues.

If Rees-Zammit fancies being part of an exciting project then the news Red Bull are poised to invest in Newcastle might have made his ears prick up.

The Falcons could be keen for a poster boy and there is a fast track at Kingston Park.

Then there is R360, a potential breakaway franchise league that wants to attract superstars with a view to a first season between September and December 2026.

However, there are still questions about what that ambitious competition will look like and Rees-Zammit has surely had enough inactivity in the NFL and will not be short of suitors.

Ospreys, Cardiff, Dragons and Scarlets face an uncertain future under WRU changes

Rees-Zammit has announced his return to rugby at a time when the WRU is considering cutting from four professional teams down to three or two.

Money is tight and Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets and WRU-owned Cardiff will not be able to compete with other clubs unless there is special help from a governing body that has its own financial challenges.

The Arms Park would be the natural fit after Rees-Zammit came through the pathway in the capital before heading to Hartpury College, while his uncle Paul Rees played for the Blue and Blacks.

Dragons chairman David Wright initially promised at least one marquee signing to supporters at a Q&A at the start of the year, but the position has changed at Rodney Parade.

At this early stage, a return for a Welsh club would seem to be a long shot unless it's what Rees-Zammit really wants for personal reasons.

"Not in a million years is he going to come to Wales," said former Ospreys and Wales winger Alex Cuthbert told the Radio Wales phone-in programme.

"It's bad to say because we'd love to have him back, he's going to bring people to stadiums, but there is so much uncertainty. 

"It's a shame because he would be a real asset and a catalyst in Welsh rugby."

It didn't go wrong as such, it's just that the NFL is extremely tough to crack.

Rees-Zammit deserves credit for having a go at making it in a new sport and he will hope that exposure to a different environment and serious media scrutiny takes him to new levels in rugby.

He was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway and started as a running back â a position where former elusive Wasps, Gloucester and England winger Christian Wade tried to make it with Buffalo Bills â before shifting to wide receiver.

He initially signed with the Chiefs, but was cut after struggling in pre-season games in 2024 and then linked up with the Jaguars as part of their practice squad.

The Welshman didn't make the step up to their active roster and has opted to return to rugby to get back out in the middle.

It's a new era for Wales under Tandy and Rees-Zammit provides another option as they look to turn around their fortunes after ending an 18-Test losing streak in Japan.

Whether the he is ready for an immediate comeback in the autumn series against Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa will become clearer when his club destination â and planned return to action â is announced.

"We know what he can do on the field and he won't have lost his speed," said former Wales flanker Josh Navidi.

"Maybe conditioning is completely different to NFL, but a month or two of work and he's back to where he is. I'm sure he's hungry to get stuck in and prove people wrong."

Wales went with Josh Adams, Tom Rogers and Keelan Giles out wide on their summer tour, while Rio Dyer, Ellis Mee, Josh Hathaway and Mason Grady will have aspirations of forcing their way back in for November.

However, Rees-Zammit's commercial clout means the WRU would welcome a swift return as they try to boost the coffers in tough financial times.

His departure on the eve of the 2024 Six Nations came as a shock to former Wales head coach Warren Gatland and his return will have been a pleasant surprise for Tandy.

Here’s what you need to know: Phil Parkinson's Wrexham have lost just one of their past 10 Championship matches

Phil Parkinson says Wrexham "are always looking" when it comes to recruiting new players but he does not anticipate making "too many changes" to his squad in January.

Having made 13 signings after securing promotion from League One last season, the Red Dragons have made a solid start to life in the Championship.

With 15 matches played, Wrexham sit 13th in the table and are just four points adrift of the play-off places going into Saturday's trip to Ipswich Town (15:00 GMT).

With the winter transfer window set to open on Thursday, 1 January, Parkinson says he does not want to disrupt his much-changed squad by making too many additions in the new year.

"We'll monitor the injury situation, but we made a lot of changes in the summer and I feel we're only just getting a settled feel in the building," the Wrexham manager told BBC Sport Wales.

"We won't be making too many changes in the January window. 

"We want to continue to work with the players we've got. When you bring in 13 players, that's a big turnaround."

The extent of any January business could hinge on Wrexham's top-six prospects, with EFL pundit Don Goodman suggesting Wrexham may have "a real go" in the mid-season transfer window.

"What you are seeing at the minute is loads of teams that are evenly matched and that gives a real opportunity," Goodman told JeffBet.

"And it could be that Wrexham might not get a better opportunity. So, with that in mind, I think there probably will be money available in January, if necessary."

He added: "If they go and spend money in January, I would expect it to be quality over quantity.

"I would expect maybe it would be a couple of players brought in that would go straight into the starting 11 and improve them rather than players brought in for the squad."

Injuries could alter Wrexham's transfer plans, with right wing-back Issa Kabore joining the likes of Jay Rodriguez, Danny Ward, Elliot Lee and Andy Cannon on the sidelines through injury.

But given the hefty squad turnover during the summer, Parkinson echoed Goodman's view that it would be a case of quality over quantity should Wrexham look to bolster their ranks in January.

"I don't think we'll need a lot," added Parkinson.

"We're always looking and, of course, you never rest on your laurels as a manager or as a group of staff, but equally, I don't want to disrupt the group too much."

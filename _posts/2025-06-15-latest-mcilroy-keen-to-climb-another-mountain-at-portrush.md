Watch: Rory McIlroy looking forward to Portrush homecoming

Rory McIlroy says he is looking forward to climbing "another mountain" by winning an Open Championship on home soil after ending a frustrating US Open on a positive note.

The Northern Irishman has struggled since his career Grand Slam-clinching victory at the Masters in April, but carded an encouraging three-under 67 to close out his week at Oakmont on seven over. 

The 36-year-old says he will play in next week's Travelers Championship before taking a couple of weeks off to "get myself in the right frame of mind" for July's Open Championship at Royal Portrush, where he missed the cut in 2019. 

"I climbed my Everest in April, and I think after you do something like that, you've got to make your way back down, and you've got to look for another mountain to climb," said the world number two. 

"An Open at Portrush is certainly one of those."

The five-time major champion added: "If I can't get motivated to get up for an Open Championship at home, then I don't know what can motivate me. 

"I just need to get myself in the right frame of mind. I probably haven't been there the past few weeks.

"But getting home and having a couple weeks off, hopefully feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, will get me in the right place again."

I've earned the right to do whatever I want to do - McIlroy

Despite a late rally in the second round, McIlroy was reduced to tears after failing to make the cut when The Open returned to Portrush for the first time in 68 years in 2019. 

"I didn't realise how emotional I was going to be at Portrush. I think that was a thing I was unprepared for more than anything else," he recalled.

"I remember I hit a shot into 12 or 13 on Friday, obviously trying to make the cut. I remember the roar I got when the ball hit the green, and I felt like I was about to burst into tears. 

"That support and that love from your own people, I was unprepared for that. I need to get myself in the right frame of mind to feel those feelings again."

McIlroy cut a dejected figure when he spoke to reporters after Saturday's third round and outlined his "frustration" with the media after a leaked story surrounding his 'non-conforming' driver at last month's US PGA Championship.

He did not speak to reporters after each of his four rounds at Quail Hollow and the opening two days of the US Open. 

The five-time major winner has struggled off the tee in recent weeks, but he appeared in better spirits after hitting 11 of 14 fairways at Oakmont on Sunday. 

"I feel like I've driven the ball well all week. After the way I drove it today, I'd say I finished in the top five in strokes gained off the tee," he said. 

"[I'm] really encouraged with the driver and how I drove it as well. It's not necessarily the driver, it's more me and sort of where my swing was. 

"I feel like I got a really good feeling in my swing with the driver, which was great. Hopefully I can continue that on into next week. It's close. 

"Physically I feel like my game's there. It's just mentally getting myself in the right frame of mind to get the best out of myself."

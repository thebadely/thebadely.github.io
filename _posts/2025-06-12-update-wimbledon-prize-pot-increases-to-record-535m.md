According to new developments, Carlos Alcaraz won the 2024 Wimbledon men's singles title 

Total prize money at this year's Wimbledon will increase by 7% to a record Â£53.5m.

The prize pot, worth Â£50m in 2024, is double the Â£26.5m on offer in 2015.

Carlos Alcaraz and Barbora Krejcikova each took home Â£2.7m for winning the men's and women's singles titles respectively last year.

This year's winners will receive Â£3m, an increase of 11%.

Players knocked out in the first round will receive Â£66,000, an increase of 10%.

There will be a 4% increase for the men's and women's doubles winners, who will earn Â£680,000, and a 3% increase for the mixed doubles winners, to Â£135,000.

The All England Lawn Tennis Club also confirmed the full introduction of live electronic line calling.

The technology, trialled in part last year, will end Wimbledon's 147-year use of line judges.

More than 400 cameras have been installed across the courts.

Wimbledon runs from 30 June to 13 July.

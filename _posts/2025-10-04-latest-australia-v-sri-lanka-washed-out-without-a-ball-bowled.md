The Women's World Cup match between Australia and Sri Lanka was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to persistent rain in Colombo.

Defending champions Australia would have been heavy favourites for the match but  they and tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka take a point each following the washout.

That point was confirmed when the umpires called the match off at 13:00 BST and is enough to take Australia, who beat New Zealand in their opening match, to the top of the table.

India have the chance to replace them at the summit on Sunday by beating fierce rivals Pakistan.

However, that game is also taking place in Colombo and the forecast suggests the weather may intervene again.

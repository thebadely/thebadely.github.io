Let's dive into the details: The front pages are dominated by Labour's conference announcements, especially its drive to counter Reform. 

The Times says moves by the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood to tighten immigration policy are an attempt to stymie the popularity of Nigel Farage's party, Reform UK. 

The paper reports that Mahmood will tell her party's conference that if Labour does not toughen its policy it risks voters seeking solace in what she calls the false promises of Farage.

Farage tells the Daily Mail that the prime minister's criticism of Reform's immigration policy as "racist" is an insult to millions of voters worried about mass migration to Britain. 

Reform UK want people granted leave to remain to have to apply again with stringent conditions attached. Sir Keir has insisted he is not painting Reform supporters themselves as racists.

According to the Financial Times, the chancellor will use her speech at the Labour conference to urge business leaders to focus on the threat, as she sees it, posed by Reform. The papers suggests that Reeves's allies are frustrated that businesses have failed to speak out against Farage and his economic policies.

The Daily Mirror emphasises there will be sanctions for anyone who does not take up Rachel Reeves's offer of a paid work placement for the long-term youth unemployed. 

"Take a job... or lose benefits" is the headline inside. The paper says it is economically in the chancellor's interests to have more people in work because, in its words, Labour's botched efforts to cut disability benefits have left Reeves scrambling to balance the books in the upcoming Budget.

The Daily Telegraph reports on its front page that councils are spending up to £950 a day to transport a single pupil with special needs to school. The paper, which has carried out a freedom of information request, said pupils were being sent on round trips of as much as 368 miles in specialist ambulances and taxis. 

The paper points out that cost of such journeys across all councils in England has doubled to more than £2bn over the past decade. The government says it will address the issue.

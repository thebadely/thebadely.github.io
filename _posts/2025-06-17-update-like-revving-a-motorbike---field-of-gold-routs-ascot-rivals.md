Experts revealed that Field Of Gold was following in the footsteps of his sire Kingman

Field Of Gold surged to a spectacular victory in the St James's Palace Stakes at Ascot.

The 8-11 favourite, under Colin Keane for trainers John and Thady Gosden, won by three and a half lengths from Henri Matisse, with Ruling Court third.

Field Of Gold had been runner-up to Ruling Court in the 2,000 Guineas, but then went on to win the Irish version and was a decisive victor here.

"Good horses make it look easy," said Keane, who replaced Kieran Shoemark on the horse after his Guineas defeat at Newmarket, and was recently appointed retained rider for owners Juddmonte.

"It's similar to revving a motorbike - when you ask him, it's instant."

Victory came 11 years after Field Of Gold's father Kingman won the same race.

Docklands landed the Queen Anne Stakes, while American Affair won the King Charles III Stakes.

King Charles and Queen Camilla watched their runner Reaching High finish ninth

King Charles and Queen Camilla were in attendance, but out of luck with their runner Reaching High in the Ascot Stakes.

Alphonse Le Grande and Reaching High both found trouble before finishing eighth and ninth behind 20-1 winner Ascending, ridden by Billy Lee for Henry de Bromhead.

"Ryan [jockey Moore] just said he got no run. He's finished full of running, but just got no luck in running, so it's disappointing," said Reaching High's trainer Willie Mullins.

Irish-trained horses filled the first four places, with Nurburgring, Comfort Zone and Leinster second, third and fourth for Joseph O'Brien.

After Rosallion's near miss, there was some comfort for trainer Richard Hannon with victory in the Wolferton Stakes as James Doyle guided home Haatem (8-1) for owners Wathnan Racing.

Doyle followed up in the same colours aboard 7-2 favourite French Master for the Gosdens in the Copper Horse Stakes.

Meanwhile, jockey Frankie Dettori hinted at a future Royal Ascot return as he made his most high-profile public appearance in the UK since filing for bankruptcy.

"Never say never," said the 54-year-old, who moved to the United States last year.

"I didn't think it was appropriate to do it, but who knows in the future. It's nice to be here and it's amazing racing through the week."

Docklands was a dramatic winner of the opening Queen Anne Stakes as the 14-1 shot beat favourite Rosallion by a nose.

The winner, trained by Harry Eustace, just gained victory in the Queen Anne Stakes in a photo finish, after Australian jockey Mark Zahra dropped his whip in the closing stages.

"Everyone kept scaring me with the whip rules so I thought it was just as easy to throw it away at the 200-metre mark," said Zahra.

The 100-1 shot Cairo was third, with Notable Speech fourth after rider William Buick also lost his whip and struggled to find a clear passage.

Docklands won the Britannia Stakes at the 2023 meeting before finishing second in the Queen Anne last year.

American Affair secured the King Charles III Stakes for Scottish trainer Jim Goldie's first Group One triumph.

Ridden by Paul Mulrennan, the 11-1 victor edged out Frost At Dawn by a neck.

"Funnily enough, I was pretty confident he would do it today. It's great - it means a lot," said Goldie, who has trained since 1994.

The 7-2 favourite Gstaad was an impressive three-length winner of the Coventry Stakes, with outsiders Do Or Do Not (80-1) and Coppull (66-1) second and third.

Moore led his mount down the middle of the track to give trainer Aidan O'Brien an 11th winner in the race.

Albert Einstein would have been favourite but for a joint injury ruling him out, and O'Brien paid a huge compliment to Gstaad's stablemate, saying he is "the most different horse we've ever seen. He's so quick".

Around 270,000 spectators are expected at the Berkshire track over the five days.

Ascot is confident it can cope with a week of warm weather, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 29C by Saturday.

"Thoroughbred racehorses are able to run in very hot temperatures, including in countries such as Dubai," said a course spokesperson.

"To ensure their welfare here at Royal Ascot we provide them with lots of water and ice if necessary.

"We've had days at Royal Ascot over 30C and we have a dedicated team of people to help cool the horses after they've raced."

Going conditions are described as good to to firm, with the ground watered to help with safety for runners and riders.

The course's dress code was relaxed for the first time during a heatwave three years ago, but the same is not expected to happen this week.

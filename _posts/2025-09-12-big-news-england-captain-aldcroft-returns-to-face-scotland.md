Let's dive into the details: Zoe Aldcroft (carrying the ball) has not featured for England since the first game of the Women's Rugby World Cup

England captain Zoe Aldcroft has recovered from injury to start the Women's World Cup quarter-final against Scotland on Sunday.

The 28-year-old, who is named at blind-slide flanker, has not played since the opening game of the tournament against the United States on 22 August because of a knee injury sustained in that match.

Fly-half Holly Aitchison starts her first game of the World Cup in place of Zoe Harrison, who drops to the bench.

World Player of the Year Ellie Kildunne had already been ruled out of the quarter-final after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's win over Australia.

The star full-back is replaced by Helena Rowland, who impressed off the bench in place of Kildunne against the Wallaroos.

Prop Hannah Botterman, who has been a standout performer so far, is not named in the matchday squad after leaving the field early against the Wallaroos because of back spasms.

Kelsey Clifford, who came on for Botterman and scored two second-half tries, is rewarded with a start in the front row alongside Amy Cokayne and Maud Muir, with Mackenzie Carson moving to the bench.

England to face Scotland in quarter-finals after win over Australia

While Morwenna Talling performed well against Australia on Saturday to help seal top spot in Pool A, former World Player of the Year Aldcroft completes a balanced and experienced first-choice back row alongside Sadia Kabeya and Alex Matthews.

Talling, 22, moves back into the second row to partner Rosie Galligan, with Abbie Ward named on the bench.

Mitchell's side have proven they can cope without Aldcroft, but getting the Gloucester-Hartpury forward back for harder tests in the knockout stage could prove vital.

England, who won this fixture 59-7 in April, are strong favourites to progress to the semi-finals, having last lost to Scotland in 1999.

Scotland are playing in their first Women's World Cup quarter-final since 2002 after wins over Wales and Fiji, but come into the game off the back of a 40-19 defeat by tournament contenders Canada.

"We are adapting well to different situations, and while we recognise Scotland have improved, we will still believe we can build pressure on them," head coach John Mitchell said. "This is an exciting challenge that we're ready for.

"We trust our girls to be consistent, take ownership of their roles, embrace the occasion, and earn the right to another week in this competition.

"The enthusiasm surrounding the tournament has been incredible, with support growing across the country. We know Bristol will be no different, and the girls are relishing the opportunity to rise to the occasion."

Victory for England will ensure they break their own record for a winning streak across both men's and women's international rugby union (30), which was ended by New Zealand at the World Cup final in 2022.

Covering multiple backline positions on the bench has been Rowland's regular role under Mitchell.

The 25-year-old was the Red Roses' starting full-back at the World Cup in 2022 before an injury ruled her out of the final.

A good tactical kicker from playing at fly-half, where she scored a record 27 points against Samoa, and her exciting running game make Rowland a natural fit.

Aitchison's return also provides extra fly-half cover behind Harrison that Rowland had been covering, freeing up the Loughborough Lightning player to push for a back-three spot.

Gloucester-Hartpury full-back Emma Sing, who is named on the bench, filled in for Kildunne during this year's Women's Six Nations Grand Slam decider against France, scoring twice in a thrilling 43-42 win.

However, Sing remains inexperienced at Test level with only 12 caps compared to Rowland's 43, as Mitchell opts for proven experience.

Completing the back three are lethal finishers Jess Breach, who is the joint top try-scorer in the tournament with six, and Abby Dow.

Breach and centre Megan Jones are the only England players to have started every game of the World Cup.

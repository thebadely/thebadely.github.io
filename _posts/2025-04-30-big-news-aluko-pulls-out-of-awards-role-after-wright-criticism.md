Experts revealed that Eni Aluko was capped 105 times for England 

Former England striker Eni Aluko has pulled out of a presenting role at this week's Women's Football Awards following her criticism of fellow pundit Ian Wright.

The 38-year-old criticised Wright last week, saying he should be aware there were "only a finite amount of opportunities" for female pundits working in women's football. 

Former Chelsea striker Aluko has since apologised for her comments, but Wright said he "cannot accept" the apology and was "very disappointed" by what was said.

The Arsenal icon and former England forward has been a long-term advocate of the women's game, working regularly as a pundit with a focus on Lionesses matches, and received widespread support following the criticism.

Against this backdrop, Aluko will not co-present the awards, alongside Gabby Logan and Jamie Carragher, to not "deflect" attention away from the nominees in London on 1 May. 

"I've decided to take a step back from being part of the hosting line-up this year," she said.

"I don't want to deflect from the joy, recognition, and celebration that this event is all about. This event belongs to the players, coaches, fans and everyone who has worked tirelessly to elevate the women's game."

Wright's Instagram post in response to Aluko's comments has been liked more than 137,000 times, including by England women's players Mary Earps, Alessia Russo and Alex Greenwood.

The 61-year-old said he will "always" try to give back to the game of football after a 15-year professional career that started at Crystal Palace in 1985.

"Because of the past, where men blocked the women's game for 50 years, the game has serious systemic challenges and it is going to take everyone to help fix it," added Wright, who has worked alongside Aluko.

"We are the country that invented modern football so we have a responsibility to lead the way in women's football.

"For me, I will always give back to the game. It has given me so much."

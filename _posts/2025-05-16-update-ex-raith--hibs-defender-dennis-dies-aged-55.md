According to new developments, Shaun Dennis playing for Raith Rovers in the early 2000s

Former Raith Rovers and Hibernian defender Shaun Dennis has died at the age of 55.

Raith announced the loss of their ex-player "with great sadness" and said he "had passed away peacefully" on Friday morning.

"All at Raith Rovers would like to send his wife Tracy and family our deepest condolences," the club said.

Dennis played at Stark's Park from 1988-97 and returned to Raith on loan from Hibs in 2000, formalising that return the following year. He also had a loan spell at Brechin City in 2004, the same year he had a stint as Rovers' caretaker manager.

He surpassed 400 appearances for the Kirkcaldy club and was capped once by Scotland Under-21s in 1991.

As well as twice helping Raith secure promotion to the top flight, he contributed to a promotion to the second tier on one occasion and was part of Jimmy Nicholl's 1994 Scottish League Cup-winning side that beat Celtic on penalties in the final at Ibrox.

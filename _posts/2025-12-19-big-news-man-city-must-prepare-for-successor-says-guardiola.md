Let's dive into the details: Enzo Maresca (left) was a former assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City

Pep Guardiola says Manchester City "must be prepared" to plan for his departure and eventual successor - but insists he is far from finished at the club.

It is understood City have started the process of identifying candidates to replace the Spaniard amid uncertainty over whether he will remain at the club next season.

Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, who was previously assistant to Guardiola at City, has said reports describing him as a potential successor to the Spaniard are "100% speculation". 

In November 2024, Guardiola signed a new contract which runs until the end of 2026-27.

Speaking on Friday, he said: "I'm happy here, I want to stay here. What can I say? Always results decide.

"When it is the [end of the] chapter the club will choose the best one to continue this incredible period in Man City.

"There have been rumours in the last years many, many times but I want to stay here. At the end of the season, we'll see."

City, who are two points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, host West Ham on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

City endured an underwhelming 2024-25 campaign, in which they failed to win any major domestic silverware for the first time since 2016â17. 

However, this term Guardiola appears to be relishing the challenge of competing on all fronts after a summer rebuild.  

"I'm excited because there is a margin to improve, to do it better. That is what I like," he said.

"Last season was a really, really tough season and I didn't give up and I was there. This season is much better in terms of many things I'm seeing and still I'm here.

"It depends on my feelings and my feeling right now is good. That's why I want to continue.

"It's going to change? Maybe, I don't know. But what I'm feeling now is not [that]. What I'm feeling now is with the players I want to continue as much, and as long, as possible."

Excluding the Community Shield, Guardiola has led City to 15 major honours since joining the club in 2016 having previously enjoyed trophy-laden spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

Rather than putting a definitive timescale to a possible departure, he indicated it was about maintaining competitiveness at the top level.

"In the Champions League we are fourth with two games left, in the Premier League we are [up] there and [we have] the Carabao Cup semi-final. That is what motivated me to wake up early this morning," Guardiola said.

"I have to visualise the team being better. When we're more solid, creating more chances and conceding less - and winning games, winning games, winning games. That is the business. That is the main reason.

"The moment I feel that it is done and with the players I cannot squeeze more - or I can't visualise how we could do better - then I will go home. Still I have the feeling."

Pressed on whether he will be at City next season, Guardiola added: "I answered that question before. I am here. What's going to happen, who knows, but if I have 10 years on my contract or six months, football changes a lot.

"There are no discussions - end of the subject. There are no discussions. I will not be here eternally, but I've said before I will not be here forever."

Maresca became Chelsea boss in June 2024 and has a contract running until 2029, with an option to extend by a further season.

When asked whether there was any truth to the reports linking him with a role at City, the Italian said: "It doesn't affect me at all because I know that is 100% speculation. And at this moment, there is no time for these kind of things. 

"First of all, because I have a contract here until 2029 probably. And my focus, I said many times, is just about this club and I'm very proud to be here. But again, it's speculation. One week ago I was in Italy, the same with Juventus. So I don't pay attention because I know that is not true.

"It's important to understand why this news was there but it is just speculation."

Fourth-placed Chelsea play Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday at 12:30.

Maresca's comments come after he said "many people" caused his "worst 48 hours" since joining Chelsea following a 2-0 win at home to Everton last weekend.

Those remarks sparked talk of a rift between the manager and controlling owner Behdad Eghbali, along with sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart.

When asked if he had spoken to those key figures, Maresca said: "We are in the same building, so we speak about different things. But about the Everton press conference, no."

Maresca then replied "absolutely, yes" when asked if he would remain at the club next season, and he also urged fans to "continue to support the team".

There was some positive news for Chelsea when Maresca revealed forwards Liam Delap (shoulder) and Estevao Willian (muscle) could return earlier than expected to face Aston Villa on 27 December.

'I will not be eternal here'

The sense of a potential change at City has seen the club begin to look at possible successors to Guardiola.

It is believed that at least two candidates have already been identified, though there has been no confirmation of any names as things stand.

BBC Sport understands that potential new signings are also aware of the possibility of Guardiola leaving at the end of the season.

The club's sporting director Hugo Viana, who arrived earlier this year, is playing a key role in compiling the shortlist of managers in the event of Guardiola departing.

A final decision on whether he sees out the contract is not expected until towards the end of this season.

While clubs will generally have succession and contingency plans in place for the event of managerial changes, the uncertainty over Guardiola's future has put City's due diligence into sharper focus.

The rift between Maresca and his superiors is an open wound and continues to cause pain.

There has been no escalation of the Italian's original comments, but there are also no apologies and no resolution.

The mood at these news conferences has become awkward and jarring, and there is a fear it could undermine what has been a reasonable start to the season.

Chelsea are fourth in the Premier League, into the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and could avoid the play-off round of the Champions League by winning their last two league-phase matches.

But could this uncertainty begin to affect a squad that was just starting to look settled?

For now, it is only Maresca who is obliged to speak as a Premier League manager. There is no requirement for the ownership or senior figures at Stamford Bridge to comment. That leaves much unsaid publicly and space for speculation to grow.

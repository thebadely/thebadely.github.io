According to new developments, Head coach Brendon McCullum says he wants to remain in charge of England but admits a decision on his future will be out of his hands.

McCullum has presided over an Ashes defeat in Australia inside three Tests, a series he previously said would "define" his team.

The New Zealander is contracted to England through to the end of the 50-over World Cup in 2027, a period that includes the next home Ashes in the same year.

"It's a pretty good gig. It's good fun," said McCullum. "You travel the world with the lads and try to play some exciting cricket and try to achieve some things.

"You want to try to get the best out of people. I don't do anything to protect the job. It's a matter of trying to just get the very best out of the people and try to achieve what you can with them."

In the aftermath of defeat in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide, Ben Stokes said he "absolutely" wants to remain England captain.

Like McCullum, Stokes has a deal with England until 2027 after signing a new central contract in November.

The futures of both men would possibly be decided by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) men's managing director Rob Key, whose position will also come under scrutiny. Key is due to address the media on Tuesday in Melbourne, the venue for the fourth Test on Boxing Day.

Asked if he believes he will be in charge for the home summer next year, McCullum said: "I don't know. It's not really up to me, is it?

"I'll just keep trying to do the job, trying to learn the lessons I haven't quite got right here and try to make some adjustments. Those questions are for someone else, not for me."

Former New Zealand captain McCullum was appointed by Key in 2022 in the aftermath of the previous Ashes tour, a 4-0 defeat.

Alongside Stokes, McCullum revitalised England's Test cricket, presiding over 10 wins from his first 11 games in charge.

But England's form has since stagnated. They have not won any of their marquee five-match series against Australia or India. Following the initial run of success, England have won 15 and lost 16 out of 33 Tests.

Any decision over McCullum's future is complicated by the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year.

Initially appointed solely as Test coach, McCullum also assumed responsibility for the England white-ball teams at the beginning of this year.

"I'm enjoying the time that I've got with these guys and we've made some progress from when I took over to where we are," he said.

"We're not the finished article, but we've definitely improved as a cricket team. We've had an identity about us.

"Now's the time for us in the last two Tests to really show that identity and try to salvage something from it."

The defeat in Adelaide extended England's winless run in Tests in Australia to 18 matches. They have not won a series in this country since 2010-11.

In once again going 3-0 down after three matches, they are left to battle against the indignity of a 5-0 clean sweep. Three previous England teams have lost Ashes series 5-0 in Australia.

England could drop batter Ollie Pope for the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where a crowd touching 100,000 is expected. Jacob Bethell is the reserve batter in the tourists' squad.

If England freshen up their pace attack, Brydon Carse seems the most likely candidate to be left out.

The visitors also have a decision to make over Shoaib Bashir, who arrived in Australia as their first-choice spinner but has not featured in the first three Tests.

Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed is in Australia playing T20 cricket in the Big Bash, but McCullum said he will not look outside his 16-man squad for reinforcements.

"I can't imagine we'll bring anyone in from the outside," he said. "We'll have to have a look at what the conditions are in Melbourne and work out what we think is going to be our best team for those conditions and that contest."

Following defeat in the second Test in Brisbane, McCullum said his team could not have a "glass jaw", while captain Stokes said Australia is "no place for weak men".

Then, in the run-up to the third Test in Adelaide, Stokes admitted to having "raw" conversations with the England players about his message.

But opener Zak Crawley later claimed to not be aware of the "weak men" comments.

When McCullum was asked if the players still have faith in his method, he replied: "I hope so. You'll have to ask them.

"I'll always have the back of my players, and always support them, and I'll always make sure that I'm protective of them as well in a public forum.

"That doesn't mean you don't challenge privately, but in a public forum, you're always protective. I guess you'll have to ask those questions elsewhere, but I wouldn't imagine anything would change in the coming days as we look to try and salvage something from this."

Stokes wants to remain captain despite Ashes defeat

Former England skipper Sir Andrew Strauss says sacking coaches and captains in the aftermath of Ashes defeats down under is not enough to change a "depressingly one-sided story" in Australia.

Strass led England to a 3-1 win in 2010-11 - their first series victory in Australia since 1986-87 - under coach Andy Flower.

"Just like so many previous tours, England have been badly beaten by a better team, exploiting their home conditions to good effect and now the blood letting will begin," said Strauss in a post on LinkedIn., external

England, still under Flower but with Sir Alastair Cook then as captain, were swept 5-0 in 2013-14, lost 4-0 under Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss in 2017-18 and 4-0 again in 2021-22 under Root and Chris Silverwood.

Flower, Silverwood and former director of cricket Ashley Giles all stood down in the aftermath of heavy defeats in Australia.

Strauss, who was Giles' predecessor as ECB managing director of men's cricket, said McCullum and Stokes will "come under extreme scrutiny for the decisions that they took in preparation for this tour".

However, he said none of those former captains, coaches and directors are solely responsible for England "losing so incredibly consistently" in Australia since 1986-87.

"We have been badly mauled time after time over there because Australia are a better team, served by a better high-performance system," he added.

"If we are genuinely serious about changing this depressingly one-sided story, then we need to look beyond sacking England coaches and captains and ask whether we are genuinely willing to make the changes necessary to break the trend."

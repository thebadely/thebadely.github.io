Experts revealed that The Daily Telegraph describes the UK's purchase of twelve jets, which will carry US tactical nuclear weapons, as a "landmark deal". The Guardian says their acquisition will "substantially expand" Britain's nuclear deterrent, and says it is bound to provoke alarm among arms control experts. 

"The world has changed" reads the Daily Mirror editorial, adding: "peace feels more precarious than ever". 

Reflecting on the ceasefire in the Middle East, The Daily Express says "each country must pursue a lasting peace with serious-minded ambition for the sake of the millions of people whose lives would be endangered by an all-out war". 

The Telegraph's cartoon shows a group of people gathered around a circular table at Nato, agreeing that defence spending should amount to five per cent of the bill for Amazon boss Jeff Bezos's wedding.

President Trump's foul-mouthed denunciation of Israel and Iran makes the front pages of the Financial Times and Metro. The FT says Trump's words amounted to "a rare rebuke for the Israeli government". Metro says the President "dropped the four-letter F-bomb".

According to The Times, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has personally warned backbenchers who are considering voting down Labour's welfare reforms that they will "devastate" the government. 

One minister is quoted saying the mood inside the government ahead of Tuesday's vote is "panic". The Daily Mail leads on the potential benefit rebellion, calling it a "humiliating threat" to the prime minister's authority.

"Any government u-turn would be embarrassing for Sir Keir", The Sun's editorial says, "for taxpayers, it would be a tragedy". Labour MPs have been told they will not be considered for promotion or ministerial roles if they choose to rebel, The i Paper reports.

The Guardian reports that police destroyed two boxes of evidence relating to the Battle of Orgreave, a notorious clash during the miner's strike. 

The files were shredded last April, shortly before the general election was won by Labour, which had a long-standing manifesto pledge to investigate the event. Police said they were destroyed because they were "outside of the retention period".

The Telegraph reports a long-running advertising study which has found, for the first time, that British adults now spend more time on their mobiles that watching TV. The paper headlines the story "viral videos killed the television star".

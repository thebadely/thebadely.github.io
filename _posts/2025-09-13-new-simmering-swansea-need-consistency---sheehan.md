It has been recently reported that Alan Sheehan has lost only one home league game since taking over at Swansea in February

Alan Sheehan says Swansea City are "simmering" rather than playing to their full potential after they were denied victory against Hull City by a 97th-minute equaliser.

Swansea looked set to claim a third win in four league games after goals from Zan Vipotnik and Ronald came either side of an Oli McBurnie strike for Hull.

But Sergej Jakirovic's team piled the pressure on in the closing stages and deservedly levelled through John Egan.

Sheehan was left frustrated by aspects of Swansea's performance â and says his side are not yet firing on all cylinders despite being unbeaten since the opening day.

"We work on a lot of different things and I still think as a team we are simmering," said Sheehan.

"We were really good in patches today but I don't think we did enough to blow them away which is the disappointing thing.

"At times, especially how we started, I thought we looked really good but then it became a bit passive, a bit of a slower game and we didn't battle against that slow tempo."

Sheehan's starting side included four of Swansea's 12 summer recruits, with five more new faces on the bench.

Striker Adam Idah was among those to come on following his deadline-day move from Celtic, though the Republic of Ireland had little opportunity to impress in the final third with Swansea on the backfoot by the time he entered the fray.

Asked how Swansea can reach their top level, Sheehan added: "We have had a lot of change in the summer. I think it's foundations and building and consistency.

"Ultimately we are 2-1 up after 96 minutes â I don't know where that time came from â but to concede in that manner is disappointing.

"When you are ahead after 96 minutes, no matter what happens we should see out the game. If we do it's a wonderful battling win. If not, it's obviously disappointing to concede like that."

Sheehan, meanwhile, declined to comment on this week's departure of director of football Richard Montague.

"I think I just focus on the game," he said.

"I think ultimately it's a question for ownership and everything like that.

"I think with how I work, with the emotions of the game, all of my attention has just gone on there. 

"I just think it's something to speak about later on."

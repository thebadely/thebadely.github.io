Let's dive into the details: Puka Nacua joined the Los Angeles Rams in 2023

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua has apologised for performing an antisemitic gesture during a livestream appearance. 

Nacua, 24, was encouraged to perform the move as a potential new touchdown celebration while appearing with internet personalities Adin Ross and Mikyle Rafi. 

"When I appeared the other day on a social media livestream, it was suggested to me to perform a specific movement as part of my next touchdown celebration," Nacua posted in a statement on Instagram. , external

"At the time, I had no idea this act was antisemitic in nature and perpetuated harmful stereotypes against Jewish people.

"I deeply apologise to anyone who was offended by my actions as I do not stand for any form of racism, bigotry or hate of another group of people."

On the livestream, Ross, who is Jewish, suggested that Nacua use a touchdown celebration in which he rubs his hands together - a gesture used as an antisemitic stereotype to portray Jewish people as greedy. 

Nacua then enacted the celebration multiple times and when asked by Ross if he would perform the celebration in a game, said: "I promise, I got you, man."

The NFL said it "strongly condemns all forms of discrimination and derogatory behavior directed towards any group or individual".

Its statement added: "The continuing rise of antisemitism must be addressed across the world. The NFL will continue to stand with our partners in this fight. Hatred has no place in our sport or society."

Eric Swalwell, a member of the US House of Representatives from California, condemned Nacua's behaviour in a post on social media, saying the Rams wide receiver should "apologise or be dropped".

Nacua, who is in his third season with the Rams, also criticised referees during the livestream.

NFL players are subject to fines for publicly criticising officials.

He is expected to further address his comments after the Rams take on the Seahawks in Seattle on Thursday night.

It has been recently reported that A retired silversmith has spent 18 months supplying thousands of candles to war damaged areas of Ukraine. 

Mark Stevens from Ludlow, Shropshire, collects the candles from churches and shops and uses the candle wax to make temporary stoves for the military and civilians.

He said many communities in the country had electricity and heating cut off so the candles played an important role and could be used in shelters. 

"It's the idea of being in a cold dark space with no light, no heat and it's something very simple," he said.

"People are throwing away candles every day so it's good recycling."

Stevens has collected an estimated thousand kilos of used candles from cathedrals, churches and charity shops, so he can personally deliver them to the frontline.

He has travelled to Ukraine four times so far and also sends the candles and cookers to the country via a charity. 

"This would heat a room," he said of one of the candles. 

"It could be used in a shelter somewhere."

Stephens also supplies generators and even vehicles to the Ukrainians.

"It's easy to ignore what's going on on our doorstep and the destruction and the waste and the environmental hazard that is being created by a war," he said.

Church warden Lesley Harling said: "I think it's amazing. Apart from anything else, the sheer amount of work that goes into it."

Many Ukrainian refugees live in Ludlow, with three of them working at the cafe at St Laurence's Church.

"I really appreciate his work," said Yuliia Shapoval.

"People need to feel like... somebody wants to help them."

Here’s what you need to know: A fifth person has been charged by counter-terrorism police in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in which two military aircraft were damaged.

Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, has been accused of offences under the Criminal Law Act of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and conspiracy to enter a prohibited place knowingly for purposes prejudicial to the safety or interests of the United Kingdom.

The incident in June saw activists break into the Oxfordshire air base and spray paint two RAF Voyager planes, causing £7m damage.

The Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed by the government, said it was behind the incident.

Khalid, of no fixed abode, was remanded in custody and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Four people were charged with the same offences last month. Two other people were arrested - a woman remains under investigation on police bail while a man has been released without charge.

Palestine Action has engaged in activities that have predominantly targeted arms companies since the start of the war in Gaza.

The government moved to proscribe the group under anti-terror laws after the group claimed responsibility for the June incident. It has since won permission to challenge the ban.

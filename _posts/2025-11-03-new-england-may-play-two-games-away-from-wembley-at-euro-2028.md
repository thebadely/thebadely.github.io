According to new developments, England played six of their seven matches at Euro 2020 at Wembley

Co-hosts England may play two games away from Wembley at Euro 2028.

BBC Sport has been told the Three Lions, who will have to qualify for the tournament, would play one of their three group matches at one of the other five English stadiums hosting games - Manchester City's Etihad Stadium, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Villa Park, Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium and St James' Park in Newcastle.

Wembley will not host any last-16 games, meaning England would also face a match away from the national stadium if they reached the first knockout round.

England are joint hosts alongside Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland.

And as first reported by the Times, Cardiff's Principality Stadium is set to host the opening game.

The full schedule will be unveiled on 12 November at the official launch of Euro 2028 in London.

The Football Association (FA) and Europe's governing body Uefa have declined to comment.

England played all their matches at Wembley at Euro 1996 as they reached the semi-finals of their own tournament.

They also hosted games at Euro 2020, which was split across several countries, and played all their games at Wembley apart from the quarter-final victory over Ukraine in Rome.

Uefa has said England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland will have to qualify for Euro 2028 - but two places will be reserved at the finals should any of those host nations fail to qualify.

Dublin's Aviva Stadium and Hampden Park in Glasgow will also host games.

Northern Ireland was originally due to, but has since pulled out after Belfast's Casement Park was removed as an option because of funding issues.

One senior source told BBC Sport the number of recently developed and expanded stadiums in England had been a major factor in the decision to take the national team away from their traditional home.

In recent years, England's men's and women's sides have played select matches across the country.

In September the men's team played Andorra at Villa Park in Birmingham because of Coldplay's concerts at Wembley. England's friendly against Senegal in June also clashed with concert season, so the match was hosted at Nottingham Forest's City Ground.

Since 2018, England have also played home matches at the City Ground, St James' Park, Manchester United's Old Trafford and Wolverhampton Wanderers' Molineux.

Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium, Southampton's St Mary's, Leicester City's King Power Stadium and Leeds United's Elland Road have hosted games too.

England manager Thomas Tuchel criticised the atmosphere at Wembley after a friendly against Wales last month.

Experts revealed that The editor of BBC Breakfast, Richard Frediani, is taking an extended period of leave after allegations about his behaviour were reported in the media.

An HR adviser from consultancy firm PwC is also supporting the corporation as it looks into the culture of the BBC One morning programme.

It comes after the Sun and Deadline reported that an internal investigation is being carried out into allegations of bullying.

The BBC said it did not comment on individual cases but takes "all complaints about conduct at work extremely seriously and will not tolerate behaviour that is not in line with our values".

A BBC statement added: "We have robust processes in place and would encourage any staff with concerns to raise them directly with us so they can be addressed."

He has been in charge of the programme, which is broadcast daily from Salford, since 2019, and is also editor of the News at One.

Last month, he accepted a Bafta Award when Breakfast won best TV news coverage for a special episode about the Post Office scandal.

Separately, in April the BBC published the findings of a review into its workplace culture, which found that some stars and managers "behave unacceptably" at work, and bosses often fail to tackle them.

In another development, the Sun is also reporting some detail of two alleged incidents which it says caused BBC bosses to speak to one of Breakfast's presenters, Naga Munchetty. The BBC said it would not comment on individual cases but took all complaints about conduct at work extremely seriously.

BBC News has approached Mr Frediani and Ms Munchetty for comment.

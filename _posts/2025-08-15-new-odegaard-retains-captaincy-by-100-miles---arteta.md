Experts revealed that Martin Odegaard was named Arsenal captain in July 2022

Manager Mikel Arteta says Martin Odegaard was the overwhelming choice of players and staff to remain Arsenal captain this season, despite criticism from club legend Tony Adams.

Former skipper Adams led the Gunners to four top-flight titles during his 19-year career.

And he insisted England midfielder Declan Rice, 26, should take the armband this season to give them a better chance of winning the Premier League for the first time since 2004.

However, Arteta revealed Norwegian Odegaard, 26, was the unanimous choice after he held a vote on the captaincy.

"Well my opinion is clear and it's not just my opinion, it's all the staff and especially the players." said the Arsenal boss.

"I asked them to vote the captain and I got the result yesterday. And by a mile, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody choosing the same person, which is Martin Odegaard, and which is the most clear sign that you can have.

"It's how they feel about who has to be their captain to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win. So I think there's no question about that."

Midfielder Odegaard has been Arsenal captain since 2022, but his side have not managed to win a trophy during that time, finishing second in the last three league campaigns.

The Gunners have spent around Â£190m this summer as they look to land a major trophy for the first time since they lifted the FA Cup in 2020 during Arteta's first season in charge.

One of the key signings was Â£64m striker Viktor Gyokeres. 

The Gunners hope his goals will make the crucial difference this term and Arteta said they are working hard to bring out the best in the 27-year-old Swede following his protracted arrival from Sporting.

"Well, we're going to do everything," added the Spaniard, who will also have Â£60m midfielder Martin Zubimendi fit for Arsenal's visit to Manchester United on Sunday in their first game of the season.

"First of all, understanding the player and exposing the player to the conditions that he can fulfil his incredible potential.

"That's going to be the key and the good thing is that there have been many players, many strikers, they have come from different leagues, they have come to the Premier League and been successful.

"And it's for us creating the right context for Viktor to do what he does the best, which is to score goals."

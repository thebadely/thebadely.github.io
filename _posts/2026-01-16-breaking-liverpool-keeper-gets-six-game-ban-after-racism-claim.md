Let's dive into the details: Rafaela Borggrafe started Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Manchester City at Anfield in October

Liverpool goalkeeper Rafaela Borggrafe has received a six-game ban for using discriminatory language towards a team-mate, it was revealed on Friday.

Reds manager Gareth Taylor explained Borggrafe accepted the sanction, following an investigation by the Football Association that began in September, and has served five of the six games already.

The incident, believed to involve Borggrafe making an allegedly racist remark, took place during Liverpool's pre-season training camp.

The 25-year-old German joined Liverpool from SC Freiburg in the summer and has made three first-team appearances.

She will serve the final match of her ban when she misses Sunday's Women's FA Cup fourth-round tie against London Bees (13:00 GMT).

Borggrafe has also been enrolled in an education programme by the FA.

Liverpool followed FA protocols by reporting the incident and awaited details of the investigation, with Borggrafe's punishment initially undecided, but the club have now been told the duration of her ban.

"The situation is the situation. The team and the club acted in the appropriate way," said Taylor in a pre-match news conference.

"We supported the FA. It has dragged on a bit, which has been frustrating for everyone involved, particularly Rafaela.

"We're happy now that it is completed and happy we have got some details on what it looks like. We all can move on."

Scotland "can't let go" of the opportunity they have to reach a first men's World Cup since 1998, says midfielder John McGinn.

McGinn set up Ben Gannon-Doak's goal as the Scots fought back from three down but ultimately lost 3-2 in Greece on Saturday.

However, Belarus' 2-2 draw in Denmark meant the Danes are only a point above Steve Clarke's side going into Tuesday's final round of qualifiers, when Scotland and Denmark go head to head at Hampden.

Win and Scotland will finish top and qualify for next summer's finals. Draw and defeat, and it's the play-offs.

"The aim of tonight was to make sure we had a cup final on Tuesday and we have it, in strange circumstances," McGinn told BBC Scotland.

"So this opportunity, we can't let it go."

He said it "shouldn't have taken us to 3-0 down" to produce the performance they mustered in the final 25 minutes.

"The manager said the last 20, 30 minutes was everything that we've shown as a group over the past five, six years which got us some success, which got us to tournaments - direct, full of energy, brave, creating chances," the Aston Villa captain explained.

"What an effort we put in towards the end. It feels a bit weird, the feeling of relief that Denmark didn't win gives us an opportunity for a cup final on Tuesday night.

"We've showed signs of a better performance, but there's still a lot to learn, we know that.

"It did baffle me a wee bit, there was only four minutes added, but you can't really expect this when you're away from home. You don't really get the rub of the green. For us, we can see the three poor goals, but what we showed tonight is character and abundance to come back to 3-2."

Aaron Hickey was replaced by Anthony Ralston at right-back for the final 15 minutes and said it was "for sure" harder being "off the pitch" than on it.

"Just having to wait and see," said the Brentford defender, 23. "But when you're on the pitch, you're just focusing on the game.

"It was chaos and just waiting on the pitch at the end of the match to hear the fans go mental was a good feeling for us. But we know we have to keep our heads on the ground and full focus for Tuesday. A massive chance, so we just need to keep our heads up.

"We need to start the match better, right from the first whistle to the end. Just give it everything. Hopefully, the Tartan Army can get behind us and go with that full momentum into the game and just put the pressure on them."

Goalkeeper Craig Gordon believed the game in Piraeus "could have ended any score", with Greek attacker Tasos Bakasetas sent off for a second booking hear the end.

"You heard the noise there from the Tartan Army," said the 42-year-old. "They've got a cup final on Tuesday night.

"That's the best we've played for a few games now. We kind of rediscovered that in the last 20 minutes, which was nice to know that's still in there.

"We're still a really good team when we play like that. So, yeah, the feeling from that point of view is good that we can take that into Tuesday."

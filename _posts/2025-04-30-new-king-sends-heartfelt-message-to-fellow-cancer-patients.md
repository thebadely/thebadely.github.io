Experts revealed that King Charles has sent a personal message to fellow cancer patients, speaking of the "daunting and at times frightening experience" for cancer sufferers and their loved ones.

In a heartfelt message to guests at a Buckingham Palace reception for cancer charities, the King spoke about becoming a cancer "statistic" - referencing the more than 1,000 new cases recorded in the UK every day.

He said his experience of living with cancer had shown that "the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion".

The message doesn't provide an update on the progress of the King's own cancer treatment, but royal sources say he is continuing in a positive direction.

The King was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024 and continues to receive regular treatment, which is said to be successful and that he is getting better.

There was a brief hospital stay for the King in March after he suffered side effects, but he was well enough in April for a state visit to Italy with a busy schedule and is said to have plans for further overseas trips.

There has been an attempt to be more open about his health problems - and this latest message reflects his sense of a shared experience with the many other families affected by cancer.

The King's statement continued: "But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity."

He praised the "community of care" of those who helped cancer patients, for their humanity as well as their expertise.

The King highlighted "the profound impact of human connection - whether in the careful explanation from a specialist nurse, the hand held by a hospice volunteer, or the shared experience in a support group". 

"While every patient's journey may be different, together you are ensuring that a cancer diagnosis need never mean facing the future without hope and support," said the King.

He quoted Dame Deborah James, who died of bowel cancer in 2022 and whose parents are guests at the reception, who said: "Have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope."

The reception at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening, attended by the King and Queen Camilla, is in honour of community projects helping people who are living with cancer and for health groups trying to prevent cancer.

Among the guests will be representatives of cancer charities including Macmillan Cancer Support, Breast Cancer Now, Maggie's and Children's Hospice South West.

The reception includes displays showing the work of groups helping people affected by cancer, including Wigs for Heroes and Move Dance Feel, which uses dance to support women with cancer.

At the Palace there are also champions of cancer charities, people living with cancer and people who lost relatives, including radio presenter Adele Roberts, former footballer Ashley Cain and actor Richard E Grant.

"Every day we see the impact that cancer is having on people's lives and that experience is even worse for some people because of who they are or where they live, which is entirely unacceptable. We are on a mission to transform cancer care, but we cannot do it on our own," said Gemma Peters, chief executive officer at Macmillan Cancer Support.

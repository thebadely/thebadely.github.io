Experts revealed that The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was first held at Longchamp in 1920

Daryz came through with a pulsating late run to beat favourite Minnie Hauk in a photo finish to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. 

The Francis-Henri Graffard trained three-year-old had only made six starts before stepping up to the 1.5 mile distance for the first time. 

But jockey Mickael Barzalona timed the run to the line perfectly to bring home Europe's richest Group One race at 12-1. 

Aidan O'Brien's Minnie Hauk, ridden by Christophe Soumillon, was heavily backed at 9-4, and the winner of the Oaks and Irish Oaks made light of a tricky draw in stall one to make it to the head of the 17-strong field from two furlongs out. 

Esteemed trainer Andre Fabre, who was aiming for a record-extending ninth win, saw his highest-place runner Sosie come home third at 16-1, while 40-1 shot Giavellotto was fourth. 

Victory in the Arc completes an amazing transformation for Daryz, who finished last in the Juddmonte International at York in August.

"I think the defeat at York helped us to win today because my horse was, for the first time, very professional and mature," said Graffard, who won the race for the first time in the colours of the late Aga Khan.

"This race has an amazing reputation and it's true that when you win it, it's very, very special. I've experienced some big wins, but this one is very, very special, especially this year."

Winning jockey Barzalona, 34, won the Derby on Pour Moi in 2011 as a 19-year-old and the Frenchman said it was a proud moment to join the list of jockeys to have also triumphed in the Arc. 

"This kind of race you have been watching since you were very young and for sure to go into the circle of people who have won this race, and especially in these colours as well, is a big privilege," he told Sky Sports.  

Byzantine Dream, Alohi Alii and Croix Du Nord had been tipped to end a 56-year wait for a first Japanese winner in the Arc, but heavy rain meant the going was not in their favour and they were never in the running.

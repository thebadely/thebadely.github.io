Experts revealed that Steps star Ian 'H' Watkins has been honoured at the British LGBT Awards.

Best known for being in the pop band, the singer was recognised for his work organising pride events and his advocacy for same-sex parents. 

Watkins is the founder of Cowbridge Pride in Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, and puts on the annual event to raise funds for local causes related to the LGBTQ+ community. 

He told the BBC receiving the honour was an "emotional" moment. 

He said: "Tonight is a really important night, all nights like this, because it's a celebration and there's lots of heart. There's real people, there are real stories.

"I think people have to remember that when everybody goes home and they take their glam rags off, that's when the real work starts."

Actor Billy Porter, best known for his role as Pray Tell in Pose, also received an award on the night in recognition of his work on stage and screen and for raising awareness of HIV prevention.

Accepting it via video message, he said he was "humbled" and called on the LGBTQ+ community to "come together and remember love always wins."

Speaking in 2021, when Porter confirmed he was living with HIV, he said he had kept it a secret for 14 years but that speaking about it helped him stop feeling ashamed of his diagnosis. 

He made his name on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for his role in the musical Kinky Boots in 2013.

The British LGBT awards are considered one of the most significant events for the LGBTQ+ community and have been held annually since 2014.

Hundreds of celebrities, campaigners and LGBTQ+ allies attended this year's event.

Other honours given out on the night included an award for the transgender community and one for being a celebrity ally.

BBC presenter Scott Mills, who won the LGBT+ advocacy award at last year's ceremony, was a co-host of the night.

He told BBC News it was important the event also reflected the work of business leaders and companies promoting inclusion.

He said: "It's about creating a more inclusive society where people are respected and they feel empowered at work and valued.

"It's not all about which celebrity is here, it's about everyday places making change for the better."

Sarah Garrett MBE, founder of the awards, said they were about "celebrating our community and those who uplift it".

Previous winners include: Adele Roberts, for her work promoting awareness of bowel cancer; Tom Daley, who won the sports personality of the year category, and Doctor Who actor David Tennant.

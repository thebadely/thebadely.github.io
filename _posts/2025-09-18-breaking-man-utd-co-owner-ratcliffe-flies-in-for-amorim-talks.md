According to new developments, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe consoles Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May

Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe met head coach Ruben Amorim at the club's Carrington training ground on Thursday.

As first reported by The Athletic, Ratcliffe flew into Manchester for talks, which were said to be pre-planned.

Ratcliffe had other meetings in addition to the one with Amorim. However, it is understood the 72-year-old is keen to help Amorim work through his current issues.

Ratcliffe did not accompany chief executive Omar Berrada to Leigh this evening to watch the club's women's side reach the Champions League main draw for the first time.

Amorim has come under huge pressure following a dismal start to the season.

Despite spending more than Â£200m on new players, United have won once - thanks to a stoppage-time penalty against Burnley last month - and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby.

While sources close to Ratcliffe have insisted he remains supportive of the former Sporting coach and point to massively improved data as a reason for their continued belief in the 40-year-old, others argue the statistics mask chronic underperformance.

United have privately dismissed a report Amorim has three games to save his job, although it is clear defeats by Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the October international break would test their faith to the maximum.

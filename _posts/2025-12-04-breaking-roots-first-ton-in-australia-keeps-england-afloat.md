Root hits his first century in Australia as England end day one on top

Second Ashes Test, the Gabba, Brisbane (day-night, day one of five)

England 325-9: Root 135*, Crawley 76; Starc 6-71

Australia: yet to bat

England won the toss

Scorecard

Joe Root finally made a century in Australia to keep England afloat on a riveting first day of the second Ashes Test in Brisbane.

With the day-night conditions fuelling the theatre, Root, who was dropped on two, tickled Scott Boland for four to reach three figures in Australia at the 30th attempt.

It sparked delirious celebrations in the rowdy corner of English support at the Gabba, while Root simply removed his helmet and shrugged his shoulders in the direction of the visitors' dugout.

Despite Mitchell Starc ripping through England once more with 6-71, Root reached 135 not out - adding an unbroken 61 in a riotous last-wicket stand with Jofra Archer - to lift the tourists to 325-9.

Root arrived in the daylight, only 15 balls into the match, as England threatened an implosion to equal their first-Test defeat at 5-2.

Starc was electric, taking both wickets with his first nine balls. The left-armer remained a menace throughout the day, leading the attack as Australia again went without captain Pat Cummins and left out off-spinner Nathan Lyon in a home Test for the first time since 2012.

Root rebuilt in a stand of 117 with Zak Crawley, the opener impressive for his much-needed 76. Root also added 54 with Harry Brook, whose inexplicably loose drive at Starc's second ball in the twilight made so much of England's day a struggle.

England had to grind under the lights. Ben Stokes took 49 balls over 19 before he was run out asking Root for a non-existent single. When Jamie Smith was bowled by Boland for England's third of four ducks, the tourists were teetering again at 211-6.

Will Jacks steadied with Root, only to chase an edge off Starc when Root had 98. In the next over, amid almost unbearable tension, Root had his Australian moment at last.

There was still time for Root and Archer to flay the weary Australia attack in 44 balls of mayhem before the close. Archer is 32 not out from 26 deliveries.

Archer clubbed two sixes, while Root celebrated his ton with a trademark reverse-scoop off Boland for a maximum of his own. It was tremendous fun at the end of a nerve-shredding day.

Starc removes Duckett and Pope as England fall to 5-2

How have there only been three days of cricket in this series? There has been enough drama to fill more than five Tests.

If England's crushing defeat in the first Test was a white-knuckle helter-skelter, this opening day in Brisbane was a titanic struggle and not for the faint-hearted.

In making the shock call to omit Lyon, Australia fielded one of their most inexperienced Test attacks in more than a decade.

Yet, despite having the advantage of winning the toss on a flat pitch, England felt under pressure for most of the day. Perhaps it is because the stakes are so high - defeat here would surely end their hopes of regaining the Ashes.

If England were rightly criticised for their reckless batting in Perth, they must be praised for their willingness to graft here. Still, the shots played by Brook, Jacks and Ollie Pope, and the needless run out of Stokes, were gifts to Australia.

In the maelstrom, Root stood tall to notch one of the few milestones missing from a glittering career. This was his 40th Test ton. Few, if any, will have been sweeter.

Its value in the context of the match is unknown, though the stand with Archer - England's highest for the 10th wicket in Australia for 43 years - is priceless.

The pitch could become uneven and Australia will eventually have to bat under lights. Thanks to Root, England have Ashes hope. For now.

'He's done it!' - Root hits maiden century in Australia

Root is England's all-time leading batter and may end his career as the greatest run-scorer in Test cricket. Still, his numbers came with the asterisk of no century on three previous tours of Australia. When he arrived in Perth last month, the West Australian newspaper dubbed him 'Average Joe'.

This innings was anything but average. When England needed him the most, Root drew on all his experience, composure and class to deliver a memorable Ashes moment in the thick Brisbane night.

Root's effort was even more impressive given the chaos of the first four overs of the day. Ben Duckett edged Starc for a golden duck, Pope chopped on, Root was dropped by diving second-slip Steve Smith off Starc and Crawley could have been caught behind off Michael Neser had Australia appealed.

Crawley, off the back of a pair in Perth, counter-attacked with classy drives until he under-edged off Neser. Brook made 31, but did not read the match situation. The vice-captain's edge off Starc was irresponsible.

If only Brook had Root's ability to adapt. Root had 61 from 94 balls, yet identified the threat of the twilight. Showing sound defence, patience and character, the Yorkshireman took another 88 balls to inch to his century.

When it came, it was glorious, a rare modern moment of joy for English Test cricket in this country. Root would no doubt give it all away for a series-levelling win.

Starc takes six wickets in another superb bowling performance

Starc was man of the match in Perth for his 10 wickets and the best pink-ball bowler in the world once against carried the Australian attack at the Gabba. He is putting together a body of work that has echoes of Mitchell Johsnon's destruction in 2013-14.

Just like Johnson, Starc changes the game when he enters the attack. Every delivery is potent with danger. He carries a threat far beyond his team-mates - four right-arm fast-medium bowlers lacking variety.

Starc extended his record in day-night Tests to 87 wickets in 15 matches. For the 26th time in his career, Starc took a wicket in the first over of an innings. In ending on 418 wickets he went past Pakistan great Wasim Akram as the most successful left-arm pace bowler in Test cricket.

The wisdom of Australia's decision to omit Lyon after 71 consecutive home Tests will only be revealed in time. Without him, if Starc is taken out of the equation, the combined figures of Australia's other seamers were 2-249.

To make matters worse, stand-in captain Smith had a poor day. He burned two reviews against Root and Australia wilted in the face of the Root-Archer assault.

Starc was at least backed up by some sensational work in the field. Josh Inglis' direct hit to run out Stokes shifted the momentum, but even that was outshone by the wicketkeeping of Alex Carey.

Carey was magnificent, often standing up to Neser, almost stumping Brook when he attempted a scoop. The gloveman's turn, chase, and flying dive to hold Gus Atkinson's top edge was spectacular.

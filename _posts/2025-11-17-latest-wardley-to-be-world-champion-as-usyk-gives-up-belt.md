Let's dive into the details: Ipswich fighter Fabio Wardley only began boxing at the age of 20

Britain's Fabio Wardley is expected to be elevated to WBO heavyweight champion after Oleksandr Usyk decided to relinquish his title.

It comes after Ukrainian fighter Usyk informed the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) he would not proceed with a mandatory title defence against Wardley.

The WBO said Usyk had "elected to relinquish his title after thoughtful consideration".

Usyk still holds the WBA, WBC and IBF heavyweight titles, having beaten Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in July to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion.

He first became the four-belt undisputed champion in May 2024 by beating Tyson Fury, before giving up the IBF title five weeks later and deciding not to fight the mandatory challenger. 

WBO president Gustavo Olivieri called Usyk "a champion of champions" in a statement. 

"The WBO extends its profound respect, admiration and gratitude to Oleksandr Usyk, an undefeated, two-division WBO undisputed world champion," Olivieri said.

"His career stands as one of the most extraordinary and historic of the modern boxing era."

The WBO added that its doors "will always remain open to Usyk and his team".

Oleksandr Usyk is an Olympic gold medallist and unbeaten in 24 professional fights

Usyk won the WBO belt in 2021 by defeating Anthony Joshua and went on to defend it four times.

In July, the WBO had ordered negotiations for a mandatory defence against interim champion Joseph Parker of New Zealand, only for a back injury sustained by Usyk to force the postponement of the fight.

But Wardley, 30, took the interim title from Parker with a huge upset in the 11th round at London's O2 Arena last month and was mandated to face Usyk before the end of September.

The WBO is yet to officially confirm Wardley's promotion but his promoter Frank Warren believes it is a formality.

"Britain has a new heavyweight world champion and a new star of the sport," Warren posted on X.

"One of the most incredible stories I've seen in my 45 years as a promoter and I could not be prouder of Fabio Wardley.

"Some huge fights ahead for 2026 as he defends his WBO belt and creates a true legacy in the sport."

Wardley only began boxing aged 20, coming through the unlicensed white-collar scene and has had just 21 professional fights.

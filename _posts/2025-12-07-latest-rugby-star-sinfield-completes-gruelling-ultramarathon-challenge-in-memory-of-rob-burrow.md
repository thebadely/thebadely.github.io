Let's dive into the details: Kevin Sinfield has completed seven ultramarathons in seven days to raise money and awareness for motor neurone disease (MND).

The rugby league legend ran about 300km (185 miles) throughout the week, starting at Bury St Edmunds Rugby Club and ending at Leeds Rhinos home ground, Headingley Stadium.

The 45-year-old completed an ultramarathon of at least 45km (27.9 miles) each day of his challenge, in bursts of 7km (4.3 miles).

On Sunday he crossed the finish line in front of hundreds of supporters, who had gathered in the stadium's North and West stands to cheer him on.

On Saturday Prince William praised Sinfield's commitment to his late friend and ex-Leeds Rhinos teammate Rob Burrow and everyone affected by MND as "truly inspiring".

After finishing earlier Sinfield said: "To the MND community and the people we've met on route, all through the last week, all through the past five years, to everybody we've met – it's an absolutely beautiful community.

"We've got to keep fighting for the MND community."

For the final few kilometres, Sinfield was joined by thousands of Santas completing the Leeds Santa Dash - including triathlete Jonny Brownlee and boxer Josh Warrington.

Sinfield and his team raised more than £1.15m during this week's challenge, beating the target of £777,777.

The money will go towards Motor Neurone Disease Association, Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, MND Scotland, Leeds Hospitals Charity and The Darby Rimmer MND Foundation.

Sinfield and Burrow first met at the Leeds Rhinos academy aged 14 and 12, before playing professionally together at the club.

Burrow was first diagnosed with motor neurone disease in December 2019 and died in June 2024.

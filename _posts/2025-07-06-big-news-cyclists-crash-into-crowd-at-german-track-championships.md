It has been recently reported that The incident happened on the fifth and final day of the Championships

The final day of the German Track Cycling Championships was abandoned after several spectators were injured when two cyclists crashed into the crowd.

The incident happened on the final bend of the men's keirin semi-finals as the two riders careered over the barriers at a speed of about 35mph at the track in Dudenhofen, western Germany.

Seven spectators were injured, some seriously, with two needing to be airlifted to hospital. The two cyclists escaped with minor injuries.

Two helicopters, six ambulances and an emergency doctor attended the incident.

"The health of athletes and spectators always comes first. Cancelling the event was therefore unavoidable. Best wishes for a speedy recovery go out to all those injured," said German Cycling marketing and communications officer Oliver Streich.

Chairman of Dudenhofen Cycling Club, Jens Hartwig, said: "I'm shocked by the accident. We've had a cycling festival here in Dudenhofen for five days. Of course, no-one wanted the event to end like this. I wish everyone involved a speedy and full recovery."

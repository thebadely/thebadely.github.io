British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski missed three championship points as they suffered a heartbreaking loss to Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos in the US Open men's doubles final.

Salisbury and Skupski were aiming to become the first all-British pair to win the Flushing Meadows title since 1903, as well as claim their first major together.

But they lost 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 to Spain's Granollers and Argentine Zeballos, who also beat them in the French Open final earlier this year.

"I am starting to dislike you guys!" Skupski said to the winning team.

"We seem to be bumping into each other all the time. Why not make it Australia? We will go again."

The Englishmen, who only teamed up at the start of 2025, were the better pair in the opening set.

A poor service game from Zeballos handed Salisbury and Skupski a break at 5-3 before Liverpudlian Skupski served it out.

They looked on track to get the job done in two sets and exact some revenge for July's defeat in Paris when leading 0-40 at 3-3 in the second - but Granollers stood firm and went on to hold.

After winning 15 successive points on serve, Salisbury faltered in the second set tie-break - dropping serve twice - to send the match to a decider.

Salisbury and Skupski did not have to defend a break point until the third set and showed resilience to stave them off initially.

Salisbury and Skupski led 5-4 when they found themselves with three championship points on their opponents' serve, but a series of poor returns cost them.

Roles were reversed in the next game as Skupski was broken before Granollers served out victory.

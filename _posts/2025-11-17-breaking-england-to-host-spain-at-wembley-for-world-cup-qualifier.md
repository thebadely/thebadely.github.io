According to new developments, England beat Spain 3-1 on penalties in the final of Euro 2025 to retain their European crown

Euro 2025 winners England will host world champions Spain at Wembley in April for a 2027 Women's World Cup qualifier.

Spain beat the Lionesses in the 2023 World Cup final, but England gained revenge when they beat them on penalties in the Euro 2025 final in July to retain their European title.

The two sides will meet again in Group A3 on Tuesday, 14 April, with an evening kick-off time to be announced in due course.

"Spain are of course one of the best teams in the world and to play them at Wembley again is exciting," said Lionesses boss Sarina Wiegman.

"We know from the Euro final just how tough they are to play against, and there's a great deal of mutual respect between the two teams."

Alongside Spain, England have been drawn against Iceland and Ukraine.

Qualifying for the next World Cup, which will be held in Brazil, follows the same format as the Nations League and is split into three tiers.

Only the four group winners in League A will automatically qualify for the finals, with the remaining teams having to go through the play-offs for the remaining eight places.

"It's a challenging group but our objective is to qualify for the World Cup, that is what we are fully focused on from now. We hope our fans can help us take one step closer to Brazil at Wembley in April," Wiegman added.

Information around venues and tickets for England's other two home games will be announced in due course.

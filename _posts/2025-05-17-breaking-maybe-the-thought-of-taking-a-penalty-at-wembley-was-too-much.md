Henderson denies Marmoush from the penalty spot with brilliant save

Erling Haaland will be sick at the sight of Wembley Stadium.

The Norway striker had the chance to end his goalscoring curse at the national stadium on Saturday, but opted to pass on the opportunity during Manchester City's FA Cup final loss against Crystal Palace.

With ball tucked firmly under his arm and with the chance to equalise from the penalty spot, Haaland astounded spectators inside the arena and those watching at home by kissing it and handing it over to Omar Marmoush, who saw his spot-kick saved by Dean Henderson.

"I thought he would want to take it but they didn't speak," said City manager Pep Guardiola.

"That moment for the penalty, it's the feeling and how they feel. They decided Omar was ready to take it.

"Omar took a lot of time when the ball was stopped, so it put more pressure on him, and Henderson made a good save."

Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested the occasion may have got to Haaland, saying: "Erling Haaland is a world-class forward, but when we are talking about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, there is no way they are giving that ball away.

"That is what separates them two players from Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe and these players. They are selfish and they want to score every game.

"When he misses chances I think you can see it gets to him and it does affect him.

"Maybe the thought of taking a penalty at Wembley might have been too much for him. You never know, he is a human being."

Palace shock Man City to win first major trophy in their history

Haaland swept all before him in his first season in England, plundering 52 goals in 53 games as City claimed a Treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup.

But he and his side have now lost in back-to-back finals at Wembley after being beaten by Manchester United last year.

In an interview with BBC Sport this week, Haaland described this season as "horrific" but said City had the chance to make amends by lifting silverware against Palace.

They failed to do so.

Haaland's goalscoring exploits since arriving on these shores have been unmatched and, despite missing chunks of this season through injury, he has still managed to score 30 goals.

But he has now failed to score in eight finals with City, extending his barren run to six games without finding the net at Wembley.

Missing three of his past seven penalty was maybe on his mind.

Shearer 'can't believe' Haaland gave penalty to Marmoush

Former England captain Alan Shearer said: "There is no way anyone is saying to me 'you're not taking a penalty today if we get a penalty'.

"Whether he has missed three in a season or whether he's been out injured, you're fit you're out on the pitch and you should be game for taking the penalty.

"I cannot believe he's turned around and said to someone else 'you take the penalty because I don't really fancy it'."

Former City defender Micah Richards said: "I know Erling Haaland's record at Wembley is not very good, but for him not to take the penalty... he is usually so confident and arrogant."

Henderson said: "Haaland might have stepped up - I wasn't sure which way to go.

"He gave it to Marmoush and I knew which way he was going. I knew I would save it."

City dominated the opening stages and Haaland had a hooked effort clawed out by the inspired Henderson, but Palace hit them on the break as Eberechi Eze swept home the goal in the 16th minute that ultimately won Palace the match.

The defeated opposition players paid due respect to Palace by waiting for the opposition to lift the trophy before slipping off with their heads bowed down the tunnel.

Haaland, though, hung about on the pitch with his runners-up medal weighing heavily around his neck, probably contemplating how this season had gone so wrong.

Palace players revelled in winning the first major trophy in the club's history and Haaland's compatriots celebrated the national day of Norway, but the striker himself had little to cheer.

There was also a changing of the guard in City's midfield as the departing Kevin de Bruyne was unable to end his illustrious career at the club on a high with a trophy, while 19-year-old Argentine Claudio Echeverri was given his debut in the second half.

"This season has been a massive disappointment for Manchester City," Richards said.

"Pep Guardiola has talked about that throughout the season. The players have not met the levels they've set in recent years.

"For City, we are looking at a rebuild - it's obvious for everyone to see - although at times today they did really well."

Guardiola said: "We didn't score so congratulations to Crystal Palace for the victory - we did everything.

"Today we were more aggressive. If you're not going to score goals, you're not going to win."

As the ticker tape rained down, the Bee Gees' classic 'Stayin Alive' pumped out over the speakers.

Haaland and his team-mates will need to do just that in their remaining two Premier League games if they are to finish in the top five in what is turning into a forgettable campaign.

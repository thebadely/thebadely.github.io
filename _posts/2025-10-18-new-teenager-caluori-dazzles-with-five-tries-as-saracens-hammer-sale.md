It has been recently reported that Saracens academy graduate Noah Caluori scored five tries on his first league start

A terrific performance from 19-year-old Noah Caluori helped Saracens sweep aside Sale Sharks at the StoneX Stadium to go second in the Prem.

Caluori ran in five tries on his first Prem start for the hosts, who scored 10 tries in total, to bounce back from last weekend's derby defeat to Harlequins impressively.

Further tries from Juan Martin Gonzalez, Hugh Tizard, Fergus Burke, Ben Earl and a penalty try - as well as 13 points kicked by the boot of Owen Farrell - saw the hosts comfortably claim a third bonus-point victory of the season.

First-half scores from Bevan Rodd and Rob du Preez proved to be in vain for Sale who were reduced to 13 men early in the second-half when Luke Cowan-Dickie was shown a red card after Tom O'Flaherty had been sin-binned shortly before the break.

It was the visitors who opened the scoring in the sixth minute when Sale prop Rodd dived over in the right corner from the back of a ruck following good work from Cowan-Dickie, although there was a suspicion of a forward pass in the build-up.

Saracens - who also celebrated captain Maro Itoje's 200th appearance for the club - responded and, on his first start of the season, Argentina international Gonzalez's pick and drive saw him crash over and get the hosts on the board.

Midway through the first period, a cohesive move resulted in Sale centre Du Preez dummying Caluori before diving over to the left of the sticks.

That was as good as it got for Sale, however, and after Farrell kicked a penalty from 30 yards out, Saracens hit the front when Caluori's wonderful line-break left Arron Reed grasping at thin air to dive over with style for a terrific score.

Following a TMO review right on half-time - O'Flaherty was adjudged to have taken out Caluori in mid-air which resulted in the Sale winger being sent to the sin-bin and a penalty try being awarded as Sarries went eight points clear at the break.

Just over 60 seconds into the second half, Sarries lock Tizard secured a bonus-point when he dived over in the left corner, while Cowan-Dickie received a red card for a high tackle while defending the try-line.

That proved to be fatal to Sale's hopes of finding a way back into the match and, with two extra men, Jamie George found the right pass before Caluori went over for his second of the game.

The academy graduate claimed his hat-trick inside 50 minutes stepping past three Sale defenders - including George Ford - to run in under the posts.

Lucio Cinti then went clear down the left wing before unselfishly setting up Burke to run in Saracens' seventh try with ease before a perfectly judged kick from Caluori set up Nick Tompkins who in turn found Earl to dot down his first try of the season.

Finding himself on the left wing, Caluori then ran in his fourth before he perfectly put the seal on a magnificent individual display, weaving around the Sharks backline to dive over under the posts with the final play of the evening.

Saracens travel to Northampton Saints on Friday (19:45 BST), while Sale take on a buoyant Leicester Tigers at Mattioli Woods Welford Road on Saturday evening (17:30).

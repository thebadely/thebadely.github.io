Let's dive into the details: Toy sales have risen for the first time since the pandemic, analysts say, as brands aim to appeal to children and adults.

The value of sales rose by 6% in the year to September compared with the same period last year, according to research company Circana.

Film releases such as Stitch, sports like Formula 1 and the popularity of brands such as Lego have driven sales.

With so-called "kidults" responsible for a third of sales, many manufacturers and sellers are targeting a sweet spot of products that different generations want to play and collect.

"The products that are doing really well at the moment, such as Lego and Pokemon, are the ones that have that cross-generational appeal," said Melissa Symonds, UK toys director at Circana, which tracks toy sales.

"It is a really difficult balance to hit, and some won't be able to make it. Some will focus on just the pre-school market, and some on adults - but the real trick is getting the balance between the two age groups."

Sales of toys and games saw a big lift during Covid as more families spent time at home during lockdowns, but sales had fallen since 2021 until this year.

The kidult market - which is toys and games for those aged over 12 - has been growing, particularly as adults buy toys for themselves.

The Toy Retailers Association, which represents sellers, has launched the latest of its annual DreamToys series, which lists what it anticipates to be some of the big sellers this Christmas.

Some of this year's picks clearly target more than one generation.

The Hot Wheels F1 racing circuit has a higher-priced set for older collectors, with more accurate livery on the cars.

However, nostalgia also plays a part. Emma Bunce, from Pokemon, said that many parents collected the cards when they were children up to 30 years ago.

They now wanted to introduce something similar to their own children, she said, while having some lighthearted relief from the world around them.

The list includes an interactive dinosaur that breaks out of an egg, selling for £65, dolls from the stage and screen show Wicked, and a game in which players have to feed themselves mini marshmallows with tiny hands.

The manufacturers of that game said it was deliberately analogue, with no batteries or internet connectivity required. However, they are encouraging players to post videos of the game on social media - an example of the line the toy industry is navigating between physical and online play.

Price is another issue for parents, many of whom are still struggling with the cost of living. Ms Symonds said that the average price of a toy last December was £13.43, with the £10 to £20 price range the most dominant in the sector.

Overall, annual sales in the UK toy sector have reached nearly £4bn, she said.

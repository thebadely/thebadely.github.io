Let's dive into the details: Djed Spence began his career at Middlesbrough before joining Tottenham in 2022

Djed Spence hopes to inspire future generations if he becomes the first Muslim player to represent the senior England men's team.

The Tottenham full-back, who has six caps for England Under-21s, has been included in the senior squad for the first time for World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.

It marks a turnaround in fortunes for the former Middlesbrough player, who was sent out on loan three times by Spurs - to Rennes, Leeds and Genoa - before establishing himself in the first team last season.

Although the Football Association does not keep a record of a player's religion, it is understood Spence could become the first Muslim man to play for the England team.

"It's a blessing - it's just amazing. I don't have the words really," said the 25-year-old.

"I pray a lot, I give gratitude to God. In the toughest moments of my life, the darkest moments, I've always believed that God has always been by my side. It's a big thing for me, my faith."

England play Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday, before travelling to face Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday.

Spence says he does not feel any additional weight on his shoulders because of his religion but hopes his story can lift others.

"I don't really feel the pressure for certain things. I just play football with a smile on my face, be happy, and the rest will take care of yourself," he added.

"If I can do it, you can do it. Not just Muslim kids, any child of any faith. Put your mind to something and you can do it."

Before 15 December last year, Spence had played just 64 minutes of Premier League football in the 2024-25 season.

After that date, he completed 90 minutes in 19 of Spurs' subsequent 22 league games.

The transformation was stark. Spence was so far down then Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou's pecking order he was not even included in the squad for the Europa League group stage.

He only came in for the knockout stage but played 180 minutes of the last-16 win against AZ Alkmaar.

He was then introduced as a substitute as Spurs beat Manchester United in the final for their first major trophy in 17 years, qualifying for the Champions League in the process.

Such was his progress last season, there was talk of Spence featuring in Thomas Tuchel's first England squad last March.

Spence missed out, with Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly called up as the new left-back face instead, despite the Spurs man making more Premier League tackles, interceptions, clearances, blocks and defensive headers at that point in the campaign.

But Spence stayed in the picture, and after playing every minute for Spurs in the new Premier League season to date he has got his call-up to the senior squad.

"It's definitely a big deal to play for England, 100%," Spence said.

"The manager has made me feel comfortable, everyone here has made me comfortable. Also I've played at under-21s, so I know a bit more. But senior level, I haven't done it before. The boys have made me feel welcome and taken me in."

He was given his England Under-21 debut by Lee Carsley in March 2022 against Albania.

Carsley wanted to take Spence to the European Under-21 Championship in 2023, where England triumphed by beating Spain in the final, but injury ruled the defender out of the tournament.

To Carsley, Spence's rise to prominence is no surprise.

"I love Djed. I think he's such a good player," Carsley told BBC Sport earlier this year. "So exciting, so attacking, athletic, a quiet guy but humble.

"He's got so many attributes, the way he can drive and dribble with the ball, score, create, defend. He's a player that there's no ceiling where he could go."

Smith scores screamer in Arsenal debut

On her Women's Super League debut for Arsenal, Olivia Smith needed just one moment of brilliance to show why she was the world's first Â£1m women's footballer. 

With the European champions trailing 1-0 to newly promoted London City Lionesses in their WSL opener, Smith unleashed a stunning strike from distance which beat goalkeeper Elene Lete on its way into the top corner. 

It was a goal that silenced any talk of pressure following the 21-year-old Canada international's high-profile switch from Liverpool in the summer and sparked the Gunners' comeback at the Emirates Stadium. 

She was only the world's most expensive women's footballer for 35 days - as Orlando Pride then signed Lizbeth Ovalle for Â£1.1m - but the question remained whether Smith would justify the fee paid for her after just one season in the English top division with Liverpool. 

But Smith was unfazed in pre-season - saying "the price tag's a price tag" - and her 29th-minute equaliser suggested she can handle the pressure.

"That's the kind of goals I want to score," Smith told BBC Sport after the 4-1 victory. 

"Any time I see an inch of space, I want to go for goal. It was a very special moment for me."

In just over an hour on the pitch, Smith registered four shots, nine touches inside the opposition box and four attempted dribbles - all higher numbers than anyone else on the pitch - and could have finished with more goals. 

"Smith has only got one thing on her mind when the ball comes to her feet - create half a yard, fire a shot on goal and force the goalkeeper into a save," said former England and Arsenal midfielder Fara Williams on BBC One. 

"She did exactly that with the goal. It was a phenomenal goal and she completely lived up to that Â£1m price tag." 

Former England and Arsenal goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis added: "Eyes, microscope, everything on her. But what a debut.

"What an absolute Canadian cannonball of a shot, a wonder strike and a contender for the goal of the season already." 

Humble & sweet, but a lion - the story of the first female Â£1m player

Arsenal come from behind to beat London City Lionesses

Smith, who made her senior international debut for Canada aged 15 years and 94 days in 2019, has long been tipped for stardom. 

She joined North Toronto Nitros in League 1 Ontario in 2022, winning the golden boot in her debut campaign with 18 goals in 11 games.

But it was only in 2023 that she turned professional, signing for Sporting, who fought off competition from Chelsea and Paris St-Germain. 

Registering 13 goals and nine assists in her first season in Europe as Sporting finished second in Portugal, Smith moved to Liverpool for a club record fee of just over Â£200,000.

She scored seven goals in 20 games for Reds in her debut WSL season before the big-money move to north London. 

"She played with such confidence last season with Liverpool under Matt Beard. Their player of the year last season," Brown-Finnis said. 

"Liverpool would have loved to keep her but with that price tag and when Arsenal come calling, it's too difficult." 

And it was tricky outing for Smith in her first Arsenal game; big-spending newcomers London City led through a penalty from captain Kosovare Asllani. 

But momentum swung when Smith produced her superb equaliser, thrilling more than 38,000 fans.

Arsenal boss Renee Slegers was also pleased. 

"It's very special," Slegers said about Smith's strike. 

"It was a fantastic individual action, and a lot of players had good actions, but of course, people come to the stands to watch good goals. 

"We're very happy to have Olivia with us. It was a fantastic goal." 

Smith added: "Just before the game, [Slegers] told me to be me and just to enjoy it. They brought me here for a reason and that's what I did today."

Olivia Smith - how she made impact on Arsenal debut

They won the Champions League last season by defeating Barcelona 1-0 in the final, but the WSL title has eluded Arsenal since 2019.

An unbeaten Chelsea emerged as the domestic champions for the sixth consecutive time last season and the Gunners - their closest challengers - were 12 points behind. 

Slegers was asked whether her side's priority this season would be winning the league title. 

"If you are Arsenal, you want to compete for all trophies," the Dutch coach told BBC Sport. 

"The game [against London City] is what's on my mind right now. But if you look bigger, if you play and work for Arsenal, you want to go for trophies."

And Slegers will hope Smith's arrival would be a factor that aids in achieving her targets for the new season. 

"We have such a good squad," the Arsenal manager said. 

"We have so many talented players who all bring their own qualities to the team and that together consistently brings a really strong Arsenal on the pitch every single game. 

"What Olivia brings is something new to what we did last year, so she adds a new layer to our game."

After completing her move to the Gunners, Smith said: "I'm hungry, I'm driven, I want to learn, I want to grow, and I want to win things, ultimately."

And if her debut is anything to go by, Smith's drive and hunger could mean Arsenal finally have the spark they need to end their long wait for the WSL crown.

Let's dive into the details: Crystal Palace have not lost a match since 16 April

Just a year ago Crystal Palace were 18th in the Premier League and worryingly without a win.

Now they are FA Cup winners and on the longest stretch of games without defeat in their 120-year history, after claiming a memorable first away victory in Europe against Dynamo Kyiv in the Conference League.

Oliver Glasner's high-flying Eagles have not lost in 19 games.

They sit third in the top flight with the only unbeaten record - three wins and three draws - having ended leaders Liverpool's 100% start.

Palace last lost a match on 16 April when they were thrashed 5-0 at Newcastle.

But they have not looked back since then, with perhaps a measure of how far they have come highlighted on Thursday, when Dynamo Kyiv - a club steeped in European history - deployed a system and tactics specifically geared to try to nullify Palace's threat.

Not that it worked.

Glasner's side beat Liverpool on Saturday to equal the 18-match unbeaten streak last achieved between February and August 1969, with Bert Head as their manager.

And they surpassed that mark with a polished performance in their maiden appearance at the group stage of a major European competition, despite having Borna Sosa sent off after earlier goals from Daniel Munoz and Eddie Nketiah.

"They are so hungry to succeed, and so ambitious, and of course we want to keep them pushing, and it is really easy to keep the focus high," said Glasner.

"We have huge respect for Dynamo Kyiv, so playing away, starting with a win with three points in the Conference League, is very positive.

"Every single competition is the same, it is as important as the other one, and this is how we want to continue, game by game, and doing the best every single game."

Palace claim historic European win despite red card

How uncertainty over Glasner future weighs heavy on Palace

Palace's form is all the more remarkable given the opposition they have faced.

Their run includes two wins and a draw against Liverpool, an FA Cup final victory over Manchester City, and draws at both Arsenal and Chelsea.

Speaking on TNT Sports, former England midfielder Owen Hargreaves, echoed the feeling that Palace - joint favourites to win the Conference League - are in a golden period of their history.

"Nineteen games unbeaten, that is truly remarkable. Credit to them, a first away win in Europe," he said.

"This team are going places. They are going up and up."

Only Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City have won more Premier League points than Palace in 2025. The Eagles' defence has also conceded just three goals in their opening six league matches this season, despite four of those coming against teams who finished in the top seven in 2024-25.

It is an incredible reversal of fortunes for a team that lost five of their first eight top-flight games last season and took until 27 October to register a league win.

Their record also compares favourably against teams on the continent. 

When it comes to unbeaten runs, European giants Bayern Munich are next on the list across Europe's big five leagues at nine games.

"I'm proud that we could start the Conference League away against a very good opponent," added Glasner. 

"I don't think about this [unbeaten] run, because it has already happened, so for me it is important what comes next."

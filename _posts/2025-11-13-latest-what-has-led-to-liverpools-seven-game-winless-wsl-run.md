Experts revealed that Liverpool won back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014

With just one point from seven Women's Super League matches this season, Liverpool are not where they want to be.

The two-time WSL champions have yet to win under new manager Gareth Taylor and find themselves second bottom of the table - ahead of West Ham only on goal difference.

They picked up their first point of the season in a 1-1 draw with Brighton last Sunday, but with defending WSL champions Chelsea and Champions League holders Arsenal their next two opponents, things could look even worse before Christmas.

So what has led to a challenging campaign and can Liverpool bounce back?

When Liverpool were relegated from the WSL in 2020, criticism over a lack of investment in the women's team was rife. 

Since then, the club have moved the women into the Melwood training centre - formerly used by the men's team - and switched to playing games at a revamped St Helens Stadium.

They have also broken their club transfer record at least three times in the last five years, showing progression in the market.

But has it been enough? 

Their budget is still well below WSL big-hitters Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City, and they have been surpassed by other teams around them in the table.

Under owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Liverpool have adopted a business model which has paid off immeasurably for the men's team, earning 11 major trophies, including two Premier League titles and a Champions League.

Their philosophy is a sell-to-buy model, where they generate profit over time and spend big when the team needs a refresh. 

This summer, the club spent Â£415m on transfers for Arne Slot's side, having received Â£187m from selling players. They also earned Â£174.9m in prize money for winning the league. 

The club's intention is to run the women's team in an equally sustainable way, but it has not worked so far and the gap to the top has grown bigger each season as Premier League-owned WSL teams have benefited from ambitious investment.

Liverpool sold key player Olivia Smith to Arsenal for a record Â£1m this summer, having bought the Canadian forward for a club-record Â£200,000 in 2024. It followed vice-captain Taylor Hinds' exit, also to the Gunners.

Liverpool will receive payment from Arsenal in instalments and have vowed to spend in January as a result. But the majority of their summer budget went on compensation to appoint Taylor following an issue with a clause in his contract at Manchester City, who sacked him in March.

By the time Taylor arrived, just four weeks before the start of the season, Liverpool were behind in their recruitment and scrambled to bring in players before their opener against Everton, including three signings on deadline day.

They also hired new managing director Andy O'Boyle, head of recruitment Rob Clarkson and technical co-ordinator Niamh Fahey this summer - all of whom will play a crucial role in their January business.

Adding quality is a must and the club cannot afford another poor transfer window.

"It's something which has been fed back in an appropriate way. This team needs help, we lost players from last season and we've not replaced them," admitted Taylor last week.

Liverpool's thin squad has been harmed further by anterior cruciate ligament injuries to key striker Sophie Roman Haug and playmaker Marie Hobinger.

They have also had to deal with tragedy off the pitch following the sudden deaths of former manager Matt Beard and kit man Jonathan Humble.

All-in-all, it's been a tough start to Taylor's managerial tenure with the Reds.

"No course that you do in your career can ever really prepare you for some of the things we have faced recently," he said.

"But I always believe the tough times make you stronger as a group. It makes things clear for us as well in terms of what we have to do, and where we have to improve.

"Worrying is certainly not worth it. When you think about some of the things we've seen happen to families involved off the pitch, it's nothing compared to the trauma they are going through.

"Of course, we care so much about what we do. We are giving everything. The supporters have been fantastic for us and we want to give something back."

Liverpool season ticket holder Philippa Smallwood said it has been a hard time for everyone at the club, including supporters.

"It feels like there has been a lack of empathy from outside the club. We know how hard it's been on a matchday to get through it," she told BBC Sport.

"Matt was a mentor to many of the players and then they lose the kit man, which adds to that emotion. It's been a really difficult time for the club."

On the pitch, Liverpool are going through a transition too.

Taylor was brought in to provide a new identity, focusing on a possession-based style and moving away from the direct, well-drilled approach they had previously.

Fan Smallwood has seen patches of progression and is encouraged by what she has seen - but understands it will take time to make an impact.

"The biggest thing for me was that we missed out on a pre-season with Taylor when there has been so much change to the style," she added.

"But I can see how it's going to work and there can be success in the future. I just think there has to be an awful lot of patience.

"The passing has been some of the best I've seen in recent years. I definitely feel like Taylor's style will suit players like Fuka Nagano. 

"The injuries just haven't helped. We need to get more numbers and better quality in January."

Liverpool have also dropped 11 points from winning positions, but defender Jenna Clark hopes Sunday's home draw with Brighton can spark a turnaround. 

"We have shown it in spells in every game that we have played so far, it just hasn't clicked for us," she told Sky Sports on Saturday.

"There's more to come from us. It is still a step in the right direction."

Taylor has vowed the club will do everything to pick up points - but not at the expense of abandoning their philosophy.

"We need to trust that it will get better, but going away from what we are trying to doâ¦ that's not what I was brought to the club to do," he added. 

"The club identified that they wanted to bring in a new way of working. We have done that. We'll continue to do that while also trying to scrap and fight for every single point we can get."

British defending champion Alfie Hewett is into the men's Wimbledon wheelchair singles final after beating Martin de la Puente in straight sets.

The two met in last year's final, where Hewett came out on top to win the title for the first time.

Hewett once again got the better of his Spanish opponent, sweeping through the opening set before coming through a closer second to win 6-0 7-5.

The 27-year-old broke De la Puente in the very first game and never let go of his control of the match from then on.

He will next face top seed Tokito Oda after the Japanese player defeated Gustavo Fernandez 7-5 6-1.

Hewett is looking to add to his 10 singles titles and could win both that and the doubles at Wimbledon for the second year in a row.

He and Gordon Reid will compete in the doubles final on Saturday, taking on second seeds De la Puente and Ruben Spaargaren.

But fellow Briton Gregory Slade missed out on a place in the quad wheelchair final as he lost 6-1 6-3 to second seed Sam Schroder.

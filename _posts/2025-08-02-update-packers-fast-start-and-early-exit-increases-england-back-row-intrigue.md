Watch all 15 tries as England ease to 97-7 win against Spain

As she wandered back into the home dressing room, her young son leading the way, her new fiancee by her side and the evening sun on her back, Marlie Packer had a smile on her face.

But it was perhaps not quite as broad as it might have been.

For an hour of England's 97-7 win over Spain, Packer was everywhere. Hitting lines and opponents, cantering in the open and grinding hard in the tight.

After the match, head coach John Mitchell described her performance as "outstanding", adding: "That's the way that she plays the game and when you see her play it like that, she's on fire."

Packer had said on the eve of the match that this game meant a lot.

It wasn't necessarily the opponents or the stage. 

England will play against better teams than an outclassed Spain and in front of bigger crowds than the 5,286 who filled one stand at Welford Road.

But being restored to the captaincy, albeit for one afternoon in Zoe Aldcroft's absence, on the brink of a home World Cup, was a big moment for one of only four survivors - along with Emily Scarratt, Alex Matthews and Natasha Hunt - from England's success at the 2014 tournament.

The clearout of Claudia Pena that spelt an early end to Packer's afternoon was clumsy, rather than malicious. 

However, the big-screen sight of her shoulder folding the Spanish full-back's leg was a video nasty that referee Aurelie Groizelau ultimately couldn't ignore. She showed red.

If Packer is suspended - a panel will meet and decide in the next few days - other back-row contenders for the World Cup starting XV can put distance between themselves and her.

Mitchell added: "It's unfortunate for Marlie because you can see the intent wasn't there.

"Unfortunately the game sets high standards in that area and I guess ultimately we're trying to protect players, so we'll take whatever we get on the chin and get on with it."

Elsewhere in the back row, number eight Maddie Feaunati, an X-factor runner of raw pace and power, had another impressive showing, scattering Spain defenders like skittles at times.

Abi Burton, the third member of the starting back row, was not as obvious, but got through a mountain of unseen work.

Also in the squad, Aldcroft is a certain starter. Alex Matthews' enduring quality and enormous engine has made her a go-to pick for Mitchell.  

And Sadia Kabeya's fetching ability is something that Packer, with considerably more miles on the clock and a different game in the first place, can't match.

There is never a good time to get a red card. But this felt like a particularly bad time.

Harrison landed seven conversions in England's win over Spain

Outside the Six Nations, Spain are the best of the rest in Europe. But that still places them several streets away from England, who are the dominant force in the world game.

Against such underpowered opponents Mitchell's concerns were for the form and fitness of his squad, rather than the outcome of the match.

Zoe Harrison gave him a scare on the injury front as she went down with a first-half knee knock, but recovered to pull strings and pick passes well at 10.

Megan Jones was a forceful presence in midfield, even if her partnership with Jade Shekells did not quite click as it might.

The versatile Helena Rowland will need to face stiffer opposition before it is clear whether a hat-trick shows that wing could be her home in England's backline.

On the other side of the pitch, Jess Breach's top-end pace - an edge she would have over Rowland - was in full evidence as she took her try, but there were errors as well.

Prop Sarah Bern was excellent, Abbie Ward mixed deft hands with heavy spadework in the second row and full-back Emma Sing grew into the game, zipping over for a good try and kicking superbly for the posts once Harrison had headed off.

There is plenty of Mitchell to muse over as he crosses the Channel for England's second warm-up match against France next weekend.

Packer too will be wondering what this afternoon all adds up to.

Let's dive into the details: A further two inquests have been opened into the deaths of former patients of jailed surgeon Ian Paterson.

Judge Richard Foster opened the inquests of Pauline Brown, who died aged 62, and Jennifer Fox, who died aged 47, at Birmingham Coroners' Court on Tuesday.

There are now 65 inquests ongoing into the deaths of patients of Ian Paterson, who was convicted of wounding patients with botched and unnecessary operations in 2017 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Mr Foster said: "I have reason to believe Mrs Brown and Ms Fox's deaths were caused by or contributed to by substandard care provided by Ian Paterson and have reason to suspect their deaths were unnatural."

The court heard that next of kin had been traced for both women but they were not present at the opening on Tuesday.

Pauline Margaret Brown - maiden name Doyle - was born in Birmingham and lived in Water Orton, Warwickshire.

A retired dressmaker, she was married to a former service engineer.

She died on 9 June 2006 at George Elliot Hospital in Nuneaton, with her cause of death recorded as metastatic carcinoma of the breast.

Jennifer Alison Fox was born in Cardiff but lived in Birmingham and had worked as bar staff.

She died on 22 August 2012 at the Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff.

Her cause of death was recorded as metastatic breast cancer.

After both inquests were opened and then adjourned to a later day, Judge Foster offered his condolences to both families and said he understood the inquests might cause further distress, which he would try to minimise.

"But it is only right a full investigation takes place," he said.

Ian Paterson worked for both Heart of England NHS Trust and private practice at Heartlands Hospital, Solihull Hospital, Good Hope Hospital, Spire Hospital Parkway and Spire Hospital Little Aston."

The majority of his patients lived in Birmingham, Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

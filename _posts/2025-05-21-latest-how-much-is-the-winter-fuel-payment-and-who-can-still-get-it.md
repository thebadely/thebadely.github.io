According to new developments, Millions of pensioners are not getting the winter fuel payment, after the government changed the rules.

Payments are only going to those who already receive pension credit or other means-tested financial support.

Pension credit tops up the state pension for those on low incomes, and is a gateway to other benefits like the winter fuel payment.

After criticism of the government's limit on the payment, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signalled a partial reversal of the changes but did not provide details.

The winter fuel payment was previously paid to all pensioners to help with energy costs during the coldest period of the year. 

But in July 2024, the government said future payments in England and Wales would go only to those on low incomes who received specified benefits such as pension credit.

The changes mean that more than 10 million pensioners did not receive a payment in winter 2024.

Several charities, unions, and MPs criticised the decision to means-test the payment.

They expressed concern about the number of older people living on a relatively small income who will miss out, and those who do not currently claim pension credit despite qualifying for it. 

It was also signalled as a source of voters' anger with the government at recent elections.

The winter fuel payment is worth £200 for those on certain benefits and born between 23 September 1944 and 22 September 1958. 

For those born before 23 September 1944, and on certain benefits, it is worth £300.

If you live with someone, and jointly claim benefits, only one of the couple receives the payment. 

Although the winter fuel payment is paid automatically, without a direct claim, the vast majority of those eligible will only receive the money if they have first registered to receive pension credit.

This is a state pension top-up, which itself is worth thousands of pounds a year, and can be a gateway to other financial support, including a reduction in council tax, a free TV licence for those aged over 75, or help with NHS costs. 

However, an estimated 760,000 eligible pensioners fail to claim it.

You could be eligible for pension credit if you are above state pension age and have an income of less that £218.15 a week, or less than £332.95 as a joint weekly income with your partner. Savings are also taken into account.

Anyone entitled to pension credit for at least one day between 16 and 22 September 2024 received the winter fuel payment last winter.

Disabled people, those caring for someone, or those with housing costs could still be eligible even if they have additional income or savings.

You can check your eligibility for pension credit via the government's online calculator.

Information is also available on how to make a claim online.

The winter fuel payment is usually paid automatically in November or December. Those eligible receive a letter confirming their entitlement.

Owing to the extra applications, some people had to wait for their claim to be processed. The Department for Work and Pensions said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.

The government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - about 15% - already live in relative poverty.

This means their income is less than 60% of the median. 

The median income is the amount of money that divides a population into two, with half earning more, and half less. 

In November, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall confirmed the government expected significantly more pensioners to be in relative poverty due to the new rules:

The annual figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000 and do not take into account any increase in the take-up of pension credit. 

Writing to MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee, Kendall said means-testing winter fuel payments "was not a decision this government wanted or expected to take" but it was "right that we target support to those who need it most".

Asked about the figures, Starmer said many pensioners would be better off from April 2025, when both the state pension and pension credit increased by 4.1%, under "the triple lock" arrangement.

Meanwhile the Committee has launched its own inquiry into pensioner poverty – partly prompted by the winter fuel cut. 

Northern Ireland Communities Minister Gordon Lyons said funding constraints meant the Stormont government would have to change the rules as well. 

He later said affected pensioners would receive of one-off payment of £100 to help with heating costs. 

The Scottish Government has announced plans for a new winter heating payment  "for every single Scottish pensioner" to be introduced ahead of winter 2025. 

Pensioners in Scotland in receipt of qualifying benefits, such as Pension Credit, will receive payments of £200 or £300 depending on their age, while other households will receive £100. 

The Holyrood government had already planned to introduce a replacement universal benefit north of the border, but said the financial implications of Labour’s decision had forced it to delay this until late 2025.

It has also announced some extra welfare funding for councils in the current financial year, as well as additional money for the Warmer Homes Scotland Scheme.

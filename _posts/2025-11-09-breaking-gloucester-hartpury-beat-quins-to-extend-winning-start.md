Here’s what you need to know: Harlequins had a 12-point lead but fell short

Reigning champions Gloucester-Hartpury continued their 100% start to the Premiership Women's Rugby season as they fought back to win 33-26 at Harlequins.

Gloucester-Hartpury have now won 14 PWR games in a row, going back to last season, thanks to Mia Venner's match-winning try at The Stoop.

Harlequins were on top for large periods and had a 26-14 lead early in the second half, but scores from Sam Monaghan, Alex Matthews and Venner turned the game.

Gloucester-Hartpury are closing in on a 12-month winning run in the league - with Bristol the last team to beat them on 30 November 2024.

Saracens were also winners on the road, beating Bristol 33-12, while Loughborough and Exeter played out a 33-33 thriller.

World Cup winner Sadia Kabeya put Loughborough in front early on, but Exeter went ahead with Claudia Moloney-MacDonald involved in two tries within three minutes.

Exeter looked set for the win, but Meg Davey crossed in the 79th minute and Helen Nelson added the extras to earn Loughborough a share of the points.

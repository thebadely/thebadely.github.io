Let's dive into the details: Lindsey Vonn had a titanium prosthesis fitted to her right knee during her time away from the sport

American Lindsey Vonn claimed a podium spot for the third time in four World Cup races by finishing third in the downhill in Val d'Isere on Saturday.

The 41-year-old, who last week became the oldest downhill World Cup winner, clinched her 141st World Cup podium finish.

Vonn, who had not raced at the French Alps resort in eight years, crossed the line in one minute 41.89 seconds - 0.35secs behind winner Cornelia Huetter of Austria, with Kira Weidle-Winkelmann of Germany in second.

"I thought it was actually not bad," Vonn said. "I skied well in the middle and then on the bottom I was carrying a lot of speed.

"With the light, I didn't quite see the terrain and I lost my balance. It cost me probably half a second or more, so I'm disappointed in myself for that mistake."

Vonn retired from the sport in February 2019 because of injury and made her competitive return in December 2024 following a partial knee replacement.

With 48 days to go until the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, which run from 6-22 February, Vonn will be hoping to add to the four World Cup titles she has gathered over a career that has spanned 20 years.

"I'm just happy that I hung on to the podium and the red [leader's] bib," added Vonn, who is now 69 points clear at the top of the overall downhill standings.

She already has one gold and two bronze Olympic medals to her name and is on track to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.

Saturday's event was part of this season's World Cup campaign, with a total of nine races taking place before the Finals at Kvitfjell in Norway on 21 March 2026. The Val d'Isere leg concludes on Sunday with a super-G.

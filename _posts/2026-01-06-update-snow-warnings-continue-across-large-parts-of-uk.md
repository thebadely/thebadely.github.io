Experts revealed that Snow and ice warnings remain in place across many parts of the UK, after an Arctic blast forced hundreds of schools to close on Monday.

Yellow alerts stretch from Penzance to the Shetland Islands, while central and northern Scotland are under more severe amber warnings.

Parts of northern and eastern England face snow and ice warnings for Tuesday, while the Met Office has warned that "disruptive" snow, wind and rain could fall in the south later in the week.

The continued stretches of temperatures at zero or below have caused travel disruption around the country and triggered cold weather payment for hundreds of thousands of households. 

Most yellow alerts across the UK will expire at 11:00 GMT with the warnings for Scotland stretching into Tuesday night.

Heavy snow of 5-10cm is widely expected across its central and northern regions, with some areas set to see up to 15cm.

The Met Office has advised those in the area not to drive and to prepare for possible power cuts.

Schools across the country continue to face closures.

"It's as bad as I've seen it," principal of St Patrick and St Brigid's College in Claudy, Phillip McCullagh, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. 

More than 150 schools in Northern Ireland will be closed on Tuesday. 

Aberdeenshire, Orkney and Shetland councils also announced that their schools would remain closed.

In Wales, some schools in Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend will be shut.

On Monday, travel both across and outside of the country was impacted by the snow and ice.

Eurostar trains were unable to reach the Netherlands and Network Rail Scotland warned of "exceptionally deep snow" limiting the progress of snow ploughs.

LNER advised anyone travelling between Edinburgh and Aberdeen not to travel until 14:00 GMT Tuesday.

Flights were grounded at Liverpool John Lennon Airport after its runway had to be closed due to snow and ice. The airport reopened later in the day.

The wintry conditions have triggered cold weather payments across 451 postcodes.

Under the scheme, households on certain benefits receive £25 automatically if the temperature is their local area is recorded or forecast as 0C or below for seven consecutive days.

Further snow is expected across the country on Thursday and Friday. The Met Office has said it could fall across England, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland.

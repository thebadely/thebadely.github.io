Bethell and Archer star as England beat South Africa by record ODI margin

Jacob Bethell can now add another bullet point to the notebook he uses to scribble down reminders before going out to bat.

He has always written notes about the bowlers he has faced - and previously taken tips from the great West Indies all-rounder Sir Garfield Sobers, who is a family friend back home in Barbados.

Now, after the 110 in the third one-day international against South Africa, he can store another in the memory bank; what it feels like to score your first professional century.

"I wouldn't say relief," the 21-year-old told BBC Sport. "It was nothing to do with other people - I wanted it for myself and the team.

"It was a great feeling, and quite an addictive feeling, so hopefully there's a few more of them to come."

'As straight as straight can be' - Bethell hits Brevis down the ground for six

Ever since he was picked, based on his undeniable talent, for a T20 against Australia almost a year ago, Bethell has been living out one of the stranger international careers.

An all-format batter, one tipped for the very top, but without a professional century to his name. Not in Tests or T20s. Not for England, Warwickshire or Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Not for anyone.

This was, of course, not the first statement innings.

There was the 50 not out on his Test debut against New Zealand last year, 96 a week later in Wellington, and 82 from just 53 balls against West Indies at Edgbaston in May.

But what would the Australian public have said had England touched down in Perth for the first Ashes Test in November with a batter yet to make a professional ton?

That has now been put to bed.

For much of this summer, Bethell and Chloe Kelly were England's most talked about substitutes.

Staying at the Indian Premier League meant he gave up a Test place that may never have been his, and he barely played afterwards.

Bethell was scratchy when he did return against India at The Oval but his flowing hands were back on show here. He flashed pulls from in front of his face and eased the ball straight with a flourish.

On his return to the dressing room, captain Harry Brook told Bethell "this is just the beginning of your career".

Brook was similarly highly rated as a youth international and when he scored his first international century in his 22nd match against Pakistan in 2022, his second and third immediately followed.

"He's just a phenomenal player, everyone knows how good he is, and I'm glad he's got that first century out of the way and hopefully now the floodgates open," said England's white-ball captain.

That England kept Bethell with them throughout the summer, rather than releasing him to Warwickshire after they opted to retain vice-captain Ollie Pope, was a mistake but also in many ways a compliment.

England keep the players they rate highest close. It is those with something to prove that get sent away.

When Bethell was struggling to regain form during The Hundred, some thought it wiser to give the 21-year-old a month in the County Championship to learn the rhythm of red-ball batting before heading down under. Not England.

They picked him to play against South Africa and doubled down by naming him the youngest man to captain for this month's tour of Ireland.

"We have identified him as someone who is going to be a really strong player and leader for us in the future," coach Brendon McCullum told Sky Sports.

"He is incredibly well planned and prepared - as much as he is a flair player, he has got a very calm head on his shoulders and he's obviously an incredible talent."

The question now is what England will do next with their "incredible talent".

First he will play South Africa and Ireland in T20s and then New Zealand across six white-ball matches before heading to Australia.

Bethell scored a century in an under-19 Test in Brisbane in 2023, averages 75 against deliveries registered as back-of-a-length (the Australian staple) across his full international career and scores freely behind square against the quicks, seemingly making him ideal for batting down under.

Such a style helped Yashasvi Jaiswal score 161 in his first Test in Australia last winter. 

The frequency Bethell is attacking spin is also only matched by Travis Head - and England need no reminding how the Australian left-hander goes on the pitches they will face.

Despite his inconsistencies, England are loyal to Pope, and Bethell himself seems to have accepted his fate.

"I don't know if these runs mean anything, but I don't think they can hurt," he admitted. "If the opportunity arises, I'll hopefully be there to take it."

There are doubters too - those yet to be convinced he is unequivocally the future of the team.

"He hasn't played enough for me to see in both first-class and Test cricket to say 100% he is going to be the next red-ball cricketer," said former England captain Alastair Cook.

"I don't think he knows how to play red-ball cricket as well as he knows how to play white-ball cricket."

Ex-England spinner Vic Marks added: "The technique is there but what you want, to have for more confidence in him, is to witness him batting for four or five hours, which you need to do in Test cricket to have a really big impact on a game.

"We sort of assume he can but it would be reassuring for him to have the opportunity to bat for a day, or even two sessions."

England dropped Graham Thorpe for Kevin Pietersen for a highly anticipated Ashes series in 2005, but a repeat still appears far off. 

More runs for Bethell will certainly mean more note-making and just maybe a decision made that bit harder...

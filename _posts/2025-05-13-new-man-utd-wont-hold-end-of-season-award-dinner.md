Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes received the 2024 Sir Matt Busby player of the year award

Manchester United have decided not to hold an end of year players' awards night for the second season running.

United cancelled their plans 12 months ago as the senior men's team finishing eighth in the Premier League, even though they won the FA Cup.

This year, the club have opted not to arrange anything.

The awards night usually involved prizes for players from across the men's, women's and youth teams. 

Although the men's side are heading for their worst league finish since the 1973-74 relegation campaign, they could still qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League. 

As was the case 12 months ago, United's women's team could win the FA Cup. They play Chelsea in the final at Wembley on Sunday. United have already qualified for next season's Women's Champions League thanks to their third-place league finish.

United have ruled out a parade if the men's side beat Tottenham in Bilbao on 21 May and instead will host a barbecue at their Carrington training ground the day after the game.

Many of the previous awards nights, which have been covered by MUTV, have been memorable, particularly in 2015 when then boss Louis van Gaal delivered an amusing eight-minute speech when he demanded those present: "I want to say something - pay attention to the manager."

Bruno Fernandes and Ella Toone won their respective player of the year awards last season.

United called on fans to vote for the men's and women's player of the season, and both teams' goals of the season, in the match programme for Sunday's home defeat by West Ham.

The awards will be presented on the pitch at Old Trafford before the men's final home game of the season against Aston Villa on 25 May.

British qualifier Tarvet 'overjoyed' to make Wimbledon second round

Wimbledon 2025

British qualifier Oliver Tarvet says he backs himself against anyone after his reward for winning on his Wimbledon debut was a second-round match with world number two and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. 

Tarvet, 21, is ranked 733rd in the world but enjoyed a comfortable opening day of the tournament as he saw off Switzerland's Leandro Riedi 6-4 6-4 6-4.

It will be a significantly tougher test against Alcaraz, who is looking to win Wimbledon for the third year in a row.

However, the Spanish player was on court for almost five hours in the sweltering heat on Monday as he avoided an upset by beating Italian Fabio Fognini 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 7-5 2-6 6-1.

"I feel like nothing has changed," said Tarvet of the challenge ahead of him.

"I've come here and not really set myself any expectations. I'm quietly confident I can win against anyone. Alcaraz isn't an exception to that. 

"He's done an incredible amount in the tennis world. He's a difficult guy not to respect. I will just go out there and try and treat it like another match. 

"At the end of the day, for me, I try and play the ball, not the player."

Tarvet's underdog story ensured there was plenty of interest in his match on court four as spectators crowded around the edges for the match against fellow qualifier Riedi, who is ranked 506th in the world but was 117th as recently as August last year.

There was little to separate the two in a tight opening few games but Tarvet got the crucial break in the ninth before holding his serve to take the first set.

Tarvet's momentum continued as he broke Riedi early in the second, with his opponent growing increasingly frustrated as he struggled to find a way through the Briton's serve on his way to losing the second set.

Then, after more than two hours of tennis played in temperatures in excess of 30C, Riedi sent a shot long at 30-40 down on his serve to hand Tarvet the decisive break in the third set.

He then closed out the match to seal a superb victory and a place in round two.

Alcaraz avoids Fognini shock after fan taken ill

Tarvet is among 23 British players featuring in the men's and women's main draw at Wimbledon - the most in 41 years.

But while it has been a fairytale run at the tournament for Tarvet, there will be some frustration for the 21-year-old, as it appears he will be entitled to significantly less than the Â£99,000 prize money awarded for reaching round two.

The Englishman studies at the University of San Diego and has developed his game in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) system.

Under NCAA rules, players are restricted in how much they can claim from professional tournaments, with Tarvet saying before the tournament that players are allowed $10,000 (Â£7,290) in profit every year, as well as any expenses incurred during the events.

Tarvet joked the rule means he will have to file a hefty expenses claim.

"I've got to find Â£60,000, Â£70,000 of expenses, tennis is an expensive sport," he said.

"Hopefully, I can make that happen. As I said, just pay my coaches a little bit extra. I don't know. We'll figure something out. Fly business class. Obviously, no, I'll keep humble."

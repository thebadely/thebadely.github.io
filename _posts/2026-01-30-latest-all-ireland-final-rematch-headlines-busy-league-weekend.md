Experts revealed that Kerry were 10-point winners over Donegal in the 2025 All-Ireland final

Outside opinions mean little to Donegal manager Jim McGuinness and his single-minded approach will continue into Sunday's All-Ireland final rematch against Kerry in Ballyshannon [13:30 GMT].

The Kingdom romped to a 39th Sam Maguire success last summer, defeating Donegal 1-26 to 0-19 in the final as Jack O'Connor's side exploded into life on their run to the title.

Some queried Donegal's zonal approach in that game but McGuinness insists "we'll decide what's right and won't be listening to anybody else" in terms of his team's tactical approach.

"There's loads of opinions out there and loads of people saying loads of things but that doesn't have any impact on my thinking whatsoever - I don't listen to those people," he said following Saturday's opening win over Dublin.

"Most of them have never coached at inter-county level, most have never stood on a sideline, most have never won anything as a coach. I only take counsel from people who have been there and done that."

Sunday's Division One game may not have the same high stakes, but for McGuinness, this will be another step along the road to where they want to be in 2026.

Donegal opened their campaign with a 1-20 to 0-20 win over the Dubs in Croke Park, while Kerry left it late against Roscommon in Killarney as Tomas Kennedy's buzzer-beater snatched victory.

Naturally, there will be a keen interest on how this weekend's game pans out and whether there will be tweaks in approach, but it is anything but a revenge mission for the Ulster champions according to their coach whose focus is on developing his squad for this year's championship.

"That game is long gone," he said of last year's All-Ireland final.

"We're heading for 2026 now and focusing on that. There's no residue there, we're back on the horse, won our first game and will see what happens next weekend."

Wins for Donegal and Down, Tyrone draw but Derry lose

Armagh impress in league win over Monaghan

There's also a repeat  of the 2024 All-Ireland final this weekend as Armagh welcome Galway to the Athletic Grounds on Saturday [17:00].

Kieran McGeeney's side were impressive in their opening win over Monaghan, while Galway head to the Orchard County seeking to bounce back from their home defeat by Mayo, who entertain Dublin on Sunday [13:30].

Monaghan are seeking a response from that 12-point reverse to Armagh when they travel to Roscommon  [Sunday, 14:00]  who are smarting from their last-gasp loss to Kerry.

The Rossies were furious Kennedy's score stood, insisting the hooter to end the game had sounded before the ball was release, but it was counted as a fine performance went unrewarded.

It was a different scenario for Monaghan who were second best against their neighbours and manager Gabriel Bannigan has challenged his side to find a response.

Cavan lost despite being in a healthy position against the Leesiders last weekend 

In Division Two, Saturday [18:00, live on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport NI website] sees the big Ulster derby as Derry welcome Tyrone to Celtic Park with both bidding for a first win, while that's also the objective for Cavan on Sunday [15:45] who host Meath.

Dermot McCabe's side seemed on course for a victory over Cork but a seven-point advantage in the closing stages finished in a one-point win for the Leesiders as Steven Sherlock's last-gasp two-point free completed the turnaround.

Meath enjoyed a much happier start as they were 0-19 to 1-13 winners over Derry with seven points from Jack Flynn helping last year's All-Ireland semi-finalists home.

Elsewhere in the Division, Kildare host Offaly on Saturday [18:00] while on Sunday, Louth welcome Cork [13:30].

Down made a winning start in Division Three, overturning a five-point deficit at the break against Clare to run out winners by the same margin at Pairc Esler.

Conor Laverty's men are on the road this weekend with Limerick their destination on Saturday [14:00] as they bid to grab another two points against the Treaty side who opened with a draw away to Laois.

It was a disappointing start to the campaign for new Fermanagh boss Declan Bonner as the Ernesiders were beaten 1-13 to 0-12 by Wexford in Brewster Park and they will make the long trek to Clare on Sunday [14:00] aiming to get their campaign on track.

New Antrim manager Mark Doran is also seeking his first league win as his side fell to a 2-16 to 1-15 home defeat by Carlow in Division Four.

The Saffrons will seek to make amends on Sunday [14:00) as they make the trip to a Tipperary side that rescued a draw away to London thanks to Cian Smith's two-pointer.

Like Antrim who host Clare on Sunday [13:00, live on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport NI website], Down's hurlers came up empty-handed in their opening Division 1B fixture and will seek to bounce back when hosting Wexford in Ballycran on Sunday [14:00].

Ronan Sheehan's men led by four at the break against Carlow at Dr Cullen Park, but a Barrowsiders' blitz early in the second half before Down lost Ruairi McCrickard to a red card turned the tables as Carlow went on to record a 2-18 to 1-11 win.

Their visitors on Sunday were 1-13 to 1-12 winners over Antrim in their opener, but had goalkeeper Mark Fanning to thank as his last gasp-free found the net to rescue the situation.

Derry endured a tough start in Division Two when falling to a heavy home defeat by Kerry and it doesn't get any easier for the Oak Leafers this week as they travel to face Laois [Sunday, 13:00] who romped to an opening win against Mayo.

In hurling's Division Three, Donegal got off to a good start with victory over Tyrone and they will seek another win over Ulster rivals when hosting Fermanagh - who had the bye last week - in Letterkenny on Saturday [14:30].

Tyrone travel to face Louth [Saturday, 14:00] who opened with an away win at Armagh, with the Orchard men away to Wicklow on Sunday [14:00].

Cavan opened their Division Four campaign with a home win over Warwickshire last week and travel to Longford on Saturday [14:00] while Monaghan - beaten by Sligo in their opener - take on Lancashire at Abbottstown on Saturday [13:00].

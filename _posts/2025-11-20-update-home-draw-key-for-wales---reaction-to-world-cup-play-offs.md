It has been recently reported that Manager Craig Bellamy led Wales to a 7-1 victory over North Macedonia which confirmed their place in the World Cup play-offs

Wales now know who stands in their way of qualifying for a second successive World Cup.

Craig Bellamy's side will face Bosnia-Herzegovina at home in the play-off semi-finals on 26 March.

The winner will then have home advantage against either Northern Ireland or Italy in the final on 31 March, with both matches played over one leg. 

Here is what Wales' pundits think of their route to next summer's finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

What is Wales' record against Bosnia and Herzegovina?

Danny Gabbidon played in Wales' famous 2-1 victory against Italy in 2002

"I think the key for Wales was getting the home draw, I feel that with that they won't be too bothered with who they got, they'll feel like at the Cardiff City Stadium they can beat anyone," said former defender Danny Gabbidon.

"Bosnia-Herzegovina is going to be a tough game. Last time we ran into them was for the Euro qualifiers and I remember that being a tough game. They're a good side and an experienced team.

"You look at the final if we get through that, it's two really tough games with Northern Ireland and Italy. It's always difficult playing against the home nations, they just bring a different vibe, different pressure, a different feel.

"Italy are a quality outfit who will be looking to qualify. It will be three World Cups they've missed out on if they don't qualify for this one, so they'll be desperate to get to the World Cup.

"We just wish the game was next month off the back of what we did on Tuesday. With the momentum we have, it's a bit weird to have to wait until March now."

"Bosnia-Herzegovina are a good team but they're beatable - we're playing home too," said ex-striker Robert Earnshaw.

"The big one is the potential of Italy or Northern Ireland, that's going to be huge.

"If it is Italy, it will take something big for us to qualify. They're probably the hardest team. I don't think anybody would've wanted Italy, but I still fancy us.

"Only two games between us and the World Cup, we have a great opportunity."

Former defender Nia Jones won 30 caps for Wales

"Wales will still be on cloud nine after their recent 7-1 victory, so they'll be confident they can comfortably beat Bosnia-Herzegovina at home, who are ranked 29 places below them," said former defender Nia Jones. 

"The final, however, would be a trickier affair, a home nations derby will be tight and edgy. But the prospect of Wales v Italy brings back fond memories of that magical night in Cardiff back in 2002, where a certain Mr Bellamy scored to help Cymru earn a shock win versus the Azzurri.

"Italy, however, have missed out on the last two World Cups, so that desperation makes them a team I'd like to avoid."

'Close to perfect' - Bellamy revels in Wales masterclass

Joe Ledley featured in Wales' 1-0 win over Northern Ireland which secured their place in the Euro 2016 quarter-finals

"Bosnia-Herzegovina are the highest-ranked team we could've played in the first round," said Joe Ledley, who won 77 caps for his country.

"Going into the final, if we do win, being home is a massive advantage whether it's Northern Ireland or Italy. Italy aren't the same team they used to be before, they lost to Norway 4-1.

"Two home ties, I don't think we can complain about that. Anything can happen at the Cardiff City Stadium."

Former striker Iwan Roberts made 15 appearances for Wales

"So it's Bosnia-Herzegovina, a team we've played four times and have never beaten in those four games," said ex-striker Iwan Roberts.

"We haven't scored in three of the four. The one game that stands out in my mind was 10 October, 2015, in Bosnia when we lost 2-0.

"But it was a great night because we qualified for Euro 2016.

"Defensively, they were solid. They only conceded seven [goals] in their eight games, and they didn't lose away from home - winning eight points from their four games.

"So it will be a tough challenge for us, but we are the favourites.

"And if we beat Bosnia, we now know that we will face either Italy or Northern Ireland in the final, in the same stadium, that's a massive bonus for us.

"Possibly two home games in the play-offs, semi-final and in the final, we could not have asked for more."

Sam Vokes was one of Wales' heroes at Euro 2016

"I was looking at location over opposition, to be honest, because I know how important that is for us," said Sam Vokes, who played at Euro 2016.

"We've seen that on Tuesday night, and that's huge for us. I agree we don't want to take it a step too far and look to the final yet, but I think all things considered, it is a good draw for us. 

"We haven't got a great record against them [Bosnia-Herzegovina)  in the past but, look, none of that group were really part of that before. 

"We've got great memories of Bosnia in the past, not for losing 2-0, but for the for the outcome."

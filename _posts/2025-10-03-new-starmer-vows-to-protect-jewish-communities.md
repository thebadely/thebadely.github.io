Experts revealed that Sir Keir Starmer has promised to do "everything" in his power to protect Jewish people as he said Britain must defeat antisemitic hate.

The prime minister was speaking after two people were killed in a car and stabbing attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, on Thursday.

Condemning the "vile individual" who carried out the "horrific" attack, on the holiest Jewish day of Yom Kippur, Sir Keir offered his condolences to the victims and their families and thanked the first responders.

Greater Manchester Police said four other people remain in hospital. 

The attacker, who has been named as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police at the scene.

Police say three suspects are currently in custody and have been arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s.

In a recorded message to Jewish people, Sir Keir said: "I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do... Nobody should have to do that. Nobody.

"And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.

"I promise you that over the coming days, you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love."

He added that hatred against Jews "is rising once again, and Britain must defeat it once again", as he reflected on the history of Jews seeking refuge in the UK.

The prime minister flew back to the UK early from the European Political Community summit in Denmark on Thursday to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee and respond to the attack.

Many national figures and community leaders have issued statements as the gravity of what happened becomes clear.

King Charles III said in a statement that he and Queen Camilla were "deeply shocked and saddened" to hear about the attack, "especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community".

"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services," the statement added.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the "barbaric terror attack".

"Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded.

"As I warned at the UN: weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and unity can defeat it."

Israel's foreign minister accused the UK government of failing to curb "rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement in Britain".

Gideon Sa'ar said Israel expects "more than words from the Starmer government" and demanded a "change of course" on tackling anti-Jewish hatred.

The Israeli embassy in the UK said it was "in close contact" with the Manchester Jewish community, the authorities and Jewish charity the Community Security Trust (CST) to "ensure that the necessary support is provided".

Thanking the police and synagogue security for their response, the CST said it was an "appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year" and it was working with the police and local Jewish community.

President of the Conference of European Rabbis, Pinchas Goldschmidt, called for more to be done to "stamp out murderous ideologies" following the attack.

"Jews in Manchester, England, woke up this morning to pray, and were murdered in their own synagogue," he said in a statement to PA.

Yom Kippur is a day of fasting and atonement and is believed to be the day God seals the fate of each person for the coming years. It is a day set aside for prayer and reflection, when work is forbidden and many attend synagogue services even if they do not do so regularly.

The Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the incident was "the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come".

He said the attack was the "tragic result" of an "unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, campuses, on social media and elsewhere".

"Our hearts are shattered," he said in a statement shared with the BBC.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said: "We are devastated at the loss of two members of our Jewish community, and our thoughts are with their families, those who are injured and receiving treatment, and all those who have been affected by this act of antisemitic terror."

It was a sentiment echoed by Imam Qari Asim, co-chairman of the British Muslim Network, who said the scenes in Manchester had "no place in our society" and "antisemitism in all its forms is totally unacceptable".

"The bloodshed and violence in the Middle East - which is excruciatingly painful to witness for all of us - must not be allowed to poison our streets in Britain," he said. 

And Allama Qamaruzzaman AzmI, chief imam of Anwaar ul Haramain Jam√© Masjid in north Manchester, said "we stand in solidarity with our Jewish neighbours and community" and he was "committed" to strengthening the bond between them.

Meanwhile, the Church of England's leader, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, said he was praying that "all may live alongside each other in harmony and respect".

The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev Dr David Walker, said he feared an increase in divisive rhetoric recently in the UK and elsewhere in the world which should not be allowed "to get ahead of our humanity".

He said "short-term political gain is no excuse for long-term damage to the fabric of our communities".

Figures from across the political spectrum have condemned the attack.

Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said on X: "We condemn whoever is responsible and will do everything within our power to keep people safe. We stand with GM's Jewish community at this time and will work through the day to support them."

Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, told BBC News: "Many Jews understood it was never 'if' an attack like this was going to happen, it was 'when', because attacks against Jews have spiralled out of control and some mass attacks have already been foiled by the security services."

But he said there was "a lot of anger" about what he said was "very little action" over anti-Jewish hate being allowed to "flourish" and "take root in institutions". He said synagogues and Jewish schools, including primary schools, have needed security "for a long time".

Asked about the synagogue attack in Manchester, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC it looks like "an outrageous attack on the Jewish community on their holiest day" - calling it "vile and disgusting".

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was "horrified and appalled" and that his "thoughts are with the victims".

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he was "horrified" and thinking of the Jewish community "who will be suffering at this time".

Green Party leader Zack Polanski said "so many of us are feeling the horrific scenes today that all come at a time of rising antisemitism", having himself "grew up and attended a synagogue in north Manchester".

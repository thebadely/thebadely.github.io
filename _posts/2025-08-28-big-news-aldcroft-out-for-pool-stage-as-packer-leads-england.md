It has been recently reported that Marlie Packer (right) will lead England in the absence of captain Zoe Aldcroft

Women's Rugby World Cup: England v Samoa

Venue: Franklin's Gardens, Northampton Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 17:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app.

England captain Zoe Aldcroft has been ruled out of the rest of the pool stage of the Women's Rugby World Cup with a knee injury.

The 28-year-old, who started the Red Roses' opening win over the United States, is one of 13 changes made by coach John Mitchell for Saturday's game against Samoa.

It is the first time since Aldcroft was appointed captain in January that she will be absent from the matchday 23, having sustained the injury in the USA match.

Former captain Marlie Packer takes over as skipper from Aldcroft, while Mitchell also opts to rest a number of his regular starters in Northampton.

Packer, the 111-cap flanker, has not played since being sent off in the emphatic World Cup warm-up win over Spain, where she again captained the side in Aldcroft's absence.

The Red Roses are on a 28-game winning run after thrashing the US 69-7 in the opening game of the tournament.

"To captain your country at a World Cup is a complete honour," said Packer, who was replaced by Aldcroft after two seasons as captain.

"Three years ago [at the World Cup in New Zealand] it was the first time I captained my country when we played South Africa, to do it again at a World Cup is very special.

"We don't want to rush Zoe [Aldcroft] and she knows the whole squad back her and want her back with us."

Utility back Helena Rowland and Claudia Moloney-MacDonald return from injury to start at fly-half and left wing respectively.

Fly-half Holly Aitchison again misses out as she continues to recover from an ankle injury, while centre Emily Scarratt was due to start but was withdrawn from the team because of a shoulder-related nerve issue.

Rowland started the opening game of this year's Women's Six Nations against Italy at fly-half, but it is not a position she has played regularly.

"It has been in our planning to give everyone game time over the first two pool matches and, bar Holly, we've been able to execute that with this selection," Mitchell said.

"Our new combination want to make each other proud and build on our performance against the USA in our opening match.

"It will be a great atmosphere for them at one of the most traditional rugby grounds in the country. They're all excited to get out there."

Record viewing figures for Women's Rugby World Cup

Jess Breach, who is one score away from 50 international tries, retains her spot after two tries against the USA, as does impressive outside centre Megan Jones.

Jones is joined by Gloucester-Hartpury's Jade Shekells in the midfield, with Emma Sing named at full-back.

In the forwards, lock Lilli Ives Campion and flanker Abi Burton, who in 2022 spent 25 days in an induced coma after being diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, are set for World Cup debuts after being named to start.

Maddie Feaunati starts at number eight against the nation her father Zak played for 13 times.

Prop Mackenzie Carson could make her first appearance from the bench after being injured in this year's Six Nations.

World Rugby women's player of the year Ellie Kildunne, who starred with two tries against the United States, is included on a strong bench that includes last week's starting half-backs Natasha Hunt and Zoe Harrison.

Samoa, who are fully amateur and ranked 15th in the world, lost their opening game 73-0 to Australia.

Head coach Ramsey Tomokino, like Mitchell, has opted to use his squad over the first two games.

Twin locks Christabelle and Demielle Onesemo-Tuilaepa start in the second row as two of eight new World Cup debutants.

Given England played two different teams across this year's Women's Six Nations and still won a fourth consecutive Grand Slam, they are likely to record a big scoreline against Samoa despite the wholesale changes.

England's record World Cup winning margin is the 82-0 victory over Kazakhstan in 2010, with their highest number of points in a World Cup game (84) coming against Fiji in 2022.

That 84-19 win over Fiji also brought the Red Roses' most tries scored in a World Cup match (14).

A bonus-point victory against Samoa would put Mitchell's side in a strong position to qualify for the knockout stages.

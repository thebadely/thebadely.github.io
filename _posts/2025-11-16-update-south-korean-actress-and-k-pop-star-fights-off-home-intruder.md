Experts revealed that South Korean actor and K-pop singer Nana managed to fight off a home intruder alongside her mother, local media reported. 

A man in his 30s reportedly broke into the star's property in Guri with a weapon and threatened the two women.

But the 34-year-old singer's agency told South Korean media that Nana - whose real name is Im Jin-ah - and her mother managed to subdue the intruder until police arrived.

The actor's mother lost consciousness during the disturbance, and both she and Nana required medical attention, the Yonhap news agency reported.

A local detective told AFP news agency that the intruder was attempting to steal valuables and had been detained on charges of aggravated robbery.

The suspect reportedly threatened both women and demanded money after breaking into the house.

Nana and her mother called the police after restraining the man, who was also taken to hospital for treatment, local media said.

Nana rose to fame in 2009 as part of the girl group After School, a popular K-pop outfit. 

The group is no longer active but she has since gained popularity over the past decade as an actor. 

She has starred in several TV series, including Kill It and Justice, both crime dramas which first aired in 2019.

Nana released her first solo album in September.

Hat-trick hero McGhie helps Scotland to big win over rivals Wales

Scotland (17) 38

Tries: McGhie 3, Brebner-Holden, Gallagher, Orr Cons: Nelson 4 

Wales (8) 8

Try: Callender Pen: Bevan

Scotland cast aside their off-field issues to condemn Wales to a record six-try defeat in their World Cup opener.

Scotland's preparations had been beset by player contract uncertainty, but they were united in a dominant performance in front of 10,054 fans in Salford, a record for a game between the nations.

Francesca McGhie celebrated a hat-trick as Wales were outclassed in almost every facet, with Leia Brebner-Holden, Evie Gallagher and Emma Orr also crossing for the host team.

Alex Callender's try had kept Wales in touch in the first half, but after that it was all about the team in blue as they recorded a record 30-point winning margin against their fellow Celts.

The victory was sweet revenge for Scotland who were devastated by a last minute Welsh penalty in their World Cup opener three years ago.

It also puts them in a commanding position to claim a spot in the quarter-finals, while Wales must realistically beat Canada - ranked second in the world - to keep their knockout hopes alive.

There was a lot of speculation in the build-up over which Scotland side would show up given the emotional turmoil players have been through this summer, but that was soon put to bed as they found themselves on the scoreboard inside the opening minute.

The ball was worked out wide to player of the match McGhie, who took full advantage of missed tackles to run in on her wing.

Wales' poor start continued with a line-out going astray, conceding a scrum penalty while full-back Nel Metcalfe looked shaky under the high ball as the Scots showed a willingness to kick.

They eventually got a foothold when Lleucu George's superb touch finder earned a five metre line-out, which Wales mauled over the line for Callender to score.

No sooner had Wales finished celebrating and Scotland were straight back in their 22. Some powerful carries in the midfield left the defence desperately exposed with players lining up to score out wide and former ballet dancer McGhie glided over.

Wales looked predictable in attack and settled for a Keira Bevan penalty to reduce the deficit after a breathless opening quarter.

Jasmine Joyce-Butchers injected some much needed fire into Welsh bellies with a meandering 40m break, but Scotland scrambled well and won a timely turnover.

McGhie then broke from Scotland's half to set up Scotland's third, the forwards trucked it up to the line allowing Brebner-Holden the opportunity to snipe as all good scrum halves do.

Wales pressed to get one back as the half drew to a close and had a promising five metre line-out, but they were penalised for an illegal maul and the chance went begging.

Wales desperately needed to find something after the break, but George looked a little casual in gathering the restart and her kick was charged down to give Scotland another attacking platform.

The backs showed slick hands to get the ball out wide to dangerwoman McGhie, who was always going to beat the last defender.

Meanwhile Wales continued to fluff their set-piece and five minutes into the half, coach Sean Lynn had seen enough and made five changes, including an all-new front row.

But the impact of big hitters like Sisilia Tuipulotu and Carys Phillips was not felt as Scotland continued to dominate, while Gwen Crabb's yellow card for a high tackle added to Welsh woes.

Scotland's scrum dominance set up their fifth try, a huge shove won a penalty which was taken quickly to allow Gallagher over on her World Cup debut.

As the clock ran down, Wales looked like they had narrowly avoided a record defeat to their Six Nations rivals, but Orr crossed on the 78th minute.

Wales were given a temporary reprieve as the final pass from Caity Mattinson looked forward, but on replay it was deemed flat to rub salt into Welsh wounds.

Some of Lynn's players left the field in tears following a result that few saw coming.

Despite all the hype and build-up surrounding Wales, they will be desperately disappointed with their showing and have a week to regroup before taking on Canada.

Scotland meanwhile will fancy their chances against Fiji to make it two wins from two.

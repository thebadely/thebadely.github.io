It has been recently reported that Sebastiaan Bornauw made his debut for Belgium in 2020

Leeds have signed Wolfsburg defender Sebastiaan Bornauw on a four-year deal for a fee of Â£5.1m.

The 26-year-old is the third signing made by Leeds since their return to the Premier League following the arrivals of Lukas Nmecha and Jaka Bijol.

Earlier on Tuesday, Leeds announced that left-back Junior Firpo has left the club following the end of his contract, with the 28-year-old set to sign for Real Betis.

Bornauw, who has four Belgium caps, moved from Anderlecht to Cologne in Germany in 2019 before joining Wolfsburg where he played Champions League football.

The 6ft 3in centre-back made 15 Bundesliga appearances during an injury-hit 2024-25 season, scoring twice.

Daniel Farke's side start their Premier League campaign at home to Everton on Monday, 18 August.

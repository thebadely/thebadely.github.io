Experts revealed that An investigation by the Sunday Times reveals that China has been buying homes across London, the majority of which have "no clear use". It reports that Beijing is also "increasing its diplomatic presence as it prepares to build a new embassy" in the capital.

What's described as a government "crackdown on parking spaces" is the lead story in the Sunday Telegraph. It says new guidance is being published, requiring councils in England to limit the number of spaces on new housing developments. The Ministry of Housing says drivers will continue to have enough parking options under the changes.

The health secretary, Wes Streeting, addresses speculation about a potential Labour leadership bid in an interview with the Observer. He tells the paper a "bizarre drive-by", in which he was accused of plotting to challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, is now "water under the bridge". When pressed on his ambitions, he says he is "diplomatically ducking" the question. "This is not a pitch or a job application", he says. "The prime minister has got my absolute support".

"You're barred, Rachel" is the headline in the Mail on Sunday, which reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been banned from her local pub in her constituency in Leeds.

And the front page of the Sunday Mirror features a photo of Prince George helping out at a homeless shelter in London, more than 30 years after it was visited by Princess Diana and an 11-year-old Prince William. The paper says George is "following in his gran's footsteps", while the Sun quotes the shelter's boss as saying that "it was a lovely moment in terms of coming full circle from 1993 to 2025".

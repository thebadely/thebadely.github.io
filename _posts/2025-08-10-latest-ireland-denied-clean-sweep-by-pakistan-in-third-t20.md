Scorecard

Ireland failed in their quest to complete a T20 international series clean sweep against Pakistan as they lost the third and final match by eight wickets at the Clontarf Cricket Club in Dublin.

Lloyd Tennant's side won the first two games to clinch the series, but Muneeba Ali's unbeaten century helped Pakistan on their way to victory on Sunday.

Ireland won the toss and decided to bat first as Amy Hunter and Gaby Lewis put on a strong 52-run partnership from 37 deliveries.

After they were both dismissed, Orla Prendergast passed a half century as she registered 64 with Ireland setting a target of 155 for four.

Ireland then claimed two early wickets as Shawaal Zulfiqar and Natalia Pervaiz fell, but Ali came to the fore for Pakistan alongside Aliya Riaz as the visitors responded well.

Their partnership brought 101 runs from 70 balls with Ali finishing with a century from 68 deliveries as Pakistan claimed the win with 14 balls left.

Next up for Ireland are their T20 World Cup qualifiers later this month as they face Germany, Netherlands and Italy.

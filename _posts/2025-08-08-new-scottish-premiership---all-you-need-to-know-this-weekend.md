Hereâ€™s what you need to know: We're only a week in and we've had chat of board ultimatums, leaked teams, the Old Firm being split, a European revolution from our Scottish teams and a Dundee United fan falling down a flight of stairs three times.

Scottish football has delivered already, but what will week two have in store?

Let's take a gander at the weekend's Premiership talking points.

Listen: Weekend Premiership preview and Euro look-back

The day Scottish football could feel good about itself

Celtic started their title defence last week against St Mirren - the team who held them to a draw in the final game of the last Premiership campaign.

Having this time overcome the stubborn Buddies thanks to a late goal, Brendan Rodgers' side will next hope to also gain some kind of revenge over the team who denied them a domestic treble in the season's finale at Hampden.

Like Celtic, the Scottish Cup winners are playing only their second match of the season. The first ended in a 2-0 defeat by Heart of Midlothian.

Aberdeen had headed to Edinburgh with their fans believing they had strengthened thanks to Jimmy Thelin's summer rebuild. Celtic, on the other hand, arrive at Pittodrie with some among their support suggesting their squad is, if anything, weaker than the one which lost in that Scottish Cup final.

However, the Hampden penalty shoot-out win apart, Aberdeen's record against Celtic is fairly horrendous and they had not beaten the Glasgow side in their 30 previous meetings.

Rodgers' team were ruthless at Pittodrie on their last visit in May - their second 5-1  scoreline against the Dons in a row and their second win there in succession.

Indeed, Celtic have not lost in 17 visits to Aberdeen since a 2-1 defeat in February 2016 and, despite the cup final setback and questions about summer recruitment, will be favourites to win their opening away league game for a fourth successive season.

Martin Boyle grabbed most of the headlines, the Australia forward bagging both goals in Hibernian's excellent 2-0 win away to Partizan Belgrade in Thursday's Conference League qualifier.

But, while the Aberdeen-born 32-year-old was the star man as he notched goals 100 and 101 for the Leith outfit, team-mate Kieron Bowie was enhancing his growing reputation further in a team full of heroes.

The 22-year-old's physicality troubled the Serb side's defence throughout and it was fouls on the striker that led to Vukasin Durdevic's 34th-minute sending off and the 70th-minute spot-kick that puts Hibs in pole position to reach the play-off round.

That came on the back of Bowie scoring both goals in Saturday's 2-1 win away to Dundee in their Premiership opener, with Kilmarnock, who have lost in their latest five visits to Easter Road, next in his sights on Sunday. 

He has come a long way in a short time since his three years with Fulham came to an end last summer after a loan spell in League One with Northampton Town and having had to wait until February to make his first Premiership start.

Six goals in 23 games for Hibs last season may not seem like a prolific total for a striker, but since that first start, he has the best minutes per goal rate of any player to score more than twice in the Scottish top-flight.

His seven goals at an average of one every 83 minutes helped earn him a first Scotland cap in June's 4-0 friendly victory over Liechtenstein and Bowie's swift rise to fame will have the former Raith Rovers trainees' family dancing in the streets of hometown Kirkcaldy. 

On the face of it, albeit on the evidence of only four unbeaten games, little has changed at Ibrox since Barry Ferguson was replaced with Russell Martin as head coach this summer.

Despite summer comings and goings, Rangers remain stubborn and clinical in European competition, while less than convincing domestically.

Having been fortunate to even escape Fir Park with a 1-1 draw in their Premiership opener against Motherwell, Martin's side already trail reigning champions Celtic by two points in what he has stated is his priority competition this season.

They can little afford to drop any more, even at this early stage, but return to domestic action on a high after establishing what looks like a winning 3-0 lead over Viktoria Plzen in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier on Tuesday.

Strong words about egos, followed by the dropping of four players, including captain James Tavernier and the much-lauded Nicolas Raskin, seemed to do the trick, but it is in the Premiership where Rangers' mentality has been most under scrutiny and where Martin must earn his managerial spurs.

Dundee would appear to be ideal opposition for their home league opener given Steven Pressley's own troubles in his first months as their head coach.

On top of their failure to qualify from their League Cup group and some fan disappointment at his appointment, the former Rangers centre-half's side lost their opening-weekend game 2-1 to Hibernian.

Dundee managed just two attempts on goal - their fewest in a Premiership home game since October 2018 against Celtic - and that came amid Pressley's admission that summer recruitment has proved equally troublesome. 

History does not provide much promise for the visitors either given Rangers are unbeaten in their last 17 meetings with Dundee, winning 14 of them, since a 2-1 defeat at Dens Park in November 2017.

The Dark Blues have not beaten the Light Blues in 19 visits to Ibrox since 2001, and a failure to win either of their two opening games for the first time since 1989-90 under Graeme Souness would again dampen enthusiasm early in Martin's tenure despite that European resilience.

All three league matches between Dundee United and Hearts last season finished as 1-0 wins to the away side, with the Tangerines winning two of those and the Jam Tarts the other.

Will Hearts make it six straight wins to start the season under new head coach Derek McInnes on Sunday?

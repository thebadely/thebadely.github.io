It has been recently reported that The Sunday Times leads on the protests in Iran, with an anonymous resident of the capital, Tehran, calling the situation "horrific". The paper says "overwhelmed" medical facilities are "filling with victims". The Sunday Telegraph carries similar claims, saying protesters have described seeing "hundreds dead". The paper has been told by a former Pentagon official that the US could launch strikes on arms supplies belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The Sun on Sunday urges the UK to offer more support to Iranian protesters, if it truly backs freedom, democracy and liberty.

The Observer says we are seeing a "world without rules", dedicating its front page to a series of cartoons depicting recent events. One shows an Iranian woman who has removed her hijab, lighting a cigarette from a burning photo of the country's Supreme Leader. It's captioned "the Ayatollah's last stand". The Telegraph also says Downing Street and European allies are discussing deploying troops to Greenland. It says European nations hope stepping up their presence in the Arctic would persuade Donald Trump to abandon his attempts to acquire the island.

The Mail on Sunday takes its lead from an article by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - who accuses Sir Keir Starmer of being "spineless" and turning the UK into a military pygmy". Farage describes as "terrifying" a reported £28bn shortfall in defence spending - at a time when, the Mail says, the "world teeters on the edge of multiple conflicts". The government has previously said it inherited an "underfunded defence system" from the Conservatives.

The Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, lends her voice to the Sunday Express, with a claim to "save high streets and kick start Britain". She accuses the chancellor of treating small businesses like "cash cows". Badenoch says the Conservatives want to reduce energy bills and remove business rates from the smallest high street shops.

Under the headline "we're healing together", the Sunday Mirror says survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing are mentoring the teachers of children caught up in the Southport stabbings - to tell them how they can help their pupils. The survivors of the 2017 attack say their schools were not given enough information about their experiences or how to support them. One Southport headteacher tells the Mirror, those who have been affected by the tragedies "share a passion to make things better".

Experts revealed that Los Angeles has a large Hispanic community and has been targeted by ICE raids

Los Angeles FC striker Jeremy Ebobisse has voiced his support for a fan protest against US president Donald Trump's deportation policies.

The 28-year-old American said the situation in Los Angeles is "not normal and we can't treat it as normal".

Protests began in Los Angeles on Friday after it emerged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were carrying out immigration raids in the city as part of Trump's aim to enact the "biggest deportation operation" in US history. 

On Saturday, 2,000 National Guard troops were deployed to the city to uphold "very strong law and order" in response to the protests.

More than 100 immigrants have been arrested in operations across the city over the past week. 

In his post-match interview, Ebobisse, who has one US cap, said: "This has been a difficult moment for the city of LA. I live downtown and I've been seeing and hearing everything that's going on. It breaks the heart to see the callous movements that we're seeing in our streets."

At Sunday's Major League Soccer match, LAFC independent supporters union 'the 3252' unfurled an "Abolish ICE" banner in the stands prior to kick-off and sat in silence throughout their side's 3-1 victory over Sporting Kansas City.

Elsewhere in the BMO Stadium, fans held handmade signs with slogans including "When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty" and "Immigrants make America".

"We're a community, we stand by each other," Ebobisse added. "It's important that in these difficult moments, we reaffirm that and don't back into our corners and be scared because solidarity is the only way through this. 

"It's not normal and we can't treat it as normal. I fear it's only going to continue to escalate. I'm with the 3252 and anyone who's affected."

Pasadena, a city located about 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles, is scheduled to host six matches at its Rose Bowl stadium during the upcoming Club World Cup, beginning with Paris St-Germain against Atletico Madrid on Sunday.

Los Angeles will also host matches during the 2026 World Cup, which is being held across the US, Canada and Mexico, before staging the 2028 Olympic Games.

LAFC defender Eddie Segura called for unity in the city, saying: "We are united and we are giving this victory to those who are suddenly having a hard time because of this situation."

A pre-match statement from LAFC, released on social media in English and Spanish, hailed the city's diversity: "LAFC believes that the true strength of our community comes from the people and cultures that make up the tapestry of this beautiful and diverse city.

"Today, when so many in our city are feeling fear and uncertainty, LAFC stands shoulder to shoulder with all members of our community. We are with you Los Angeles."

Experts revealed that Jonny Evans has enjoyed a distinguished club career

Former Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans has retired as a player and will take up a role with Manchester United as their head of loans and pathways.

As well as two spells with the Old Trafford giants, the 37-year-old also played in the Premier League for West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City, and had two periods on loan at Sunderland.

Evans, who made 241 appearances for United, came through their academy and won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, Club World Cup, FA Cup and two League Cups with the club.

"I want to officially announce my retirement from my playing career, not with sadness, but with pride, gratitude and excitement for the next chapter ahead," Evans told the club's website.

"I'll be forever indebted to the managers, coaches, staff and, of course, my team-mates, that I have had the privilege of working alongside throughout my 20 years in professional football."

Manchester United say his new role will involve him leading on loan moves for the club's young players, working with director of football Jason Wilcox to maximise player development and prepare young talent for the first team.

"Having had experience of loans myself, I know the crucial role that they can play within a player's development. I am excited to help further develop the pathway to our first team and continue the legacy of young players thriving at Manchester United," Evans added.

Jason Wilcox, United's director of football, said: "Jonny is the perfect role model for our young players.

"His knowledge of what it takes to succeed at Manchester United will be of great benefit to each of them as we continue to develop world-class talent capable of performing in our first team."

As a player, Evans left Old Trafford in 2015 but returned eight years later when Erik ten Hag was manager.

Evans played a key role as Leicester won the FA Cup in 2021 before returning on a one-year deal in 2023, winning the 2024 FA Cup before extending his deal for a further season.

He earned 107 international caps between 2006 and 2024, scoring six goals and captaining his country 15 times.

His first Northern Ireland appearance came as an 18-year-old in a memorable 3-2 win over Spain in Belfast, in September 2006, with his last against the same opposition in a 5-1 friendly defeat in Mallorca in June 2024.

Two months later he announced his retirement from international football.

Evans was a member of Michael O'Neill's squad which took part in the Euro 2016 finals in France.

He was awarded an MBE in 2023 for services to football in Northern Ireland.

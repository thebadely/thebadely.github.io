Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The 2026 World Cup will take place in Canada, Mexico and the United States from 11 June to 19 July

Cape Verde are the 22nd team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup - and at least five more of the 48 places will be decided this week.

Asia and Africa are where all of the latest guaranteed spots will come from, with two from Asia and four more from Africa up for grabs.

Cape Verde, who will be the second-smallest World Cup country ever, Ghana, Egypt and Algeria all sealed their spot during this international break.

Two European nations could book their place this week - England and Portugal.

Thomas Tuchel's men will qualify with victory over Latvia on Tuesday.

Each of Fifa's six confederations use different methods of qualification to determine which nations out of each continent qualify for the World Cup.

Oceania is currently the only continent to have completed its direct qualification process for next year's World Cup.

Of the 48 teams at the tournament, three places are given to the host nations and 43 of them are earned via direct qualification from the six confederations.

The other two spots are determined via the results of the intercontinental play-offs.

Brazil are the only nation to have featured at every World Cup in the competition's history

Qualifying places: Six, plus one into intercontinental play-offs.

Teams already through: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay. 

Intercontinental play-offs: Bolivia. 

South American qualifying comprises a big group involving all 10 teams playing 18 games each, which started in September 2023.

The top six all reach the World Cup, with seventh place going into the intercontinental play-offs.

With their qualifying now over, Bolivia beat Brazil 1-0 in the final round of games to reach the intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying places: Eight, plus one into intercontinental play-offs.

Teams already through: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, South Korea, Uzbekistan.   

Asian qualifying started in October 2023 with the lower-ranked teams in action.

In the third round, the top two teams in three different groups qualified automatically.

Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan and Australia have secured their spots.

UAE, Qatar, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia are in a fourth round of qualifying and two of those will also qualify automatically this month. One other side will progress via the intercontinental play-offs following a Asia play-off in November.

Qualifying places: Nine, plus one into intercontinental play-offs

Teams already through: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Tunisia. 

There are nine African groups of World Cup qualifying, each with six teams, which started in November 2023.

The top team in each group go through automatically - with Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana and Cape Verde guaranteeing their places. 

The other current leaders are Senegal, Benin and Ivory Coast.

The final rounds of group fixtures are taking place during October's international break.

The best four runners-up go into play-offs in November for the chance to earn a spot into the intercontinental play-offs.

Mauricio Pochettino will lead the United States in their first World Cup as a host nation since 1994

Qualifying places: Six (including three hosts), plus two into intercontinental play-offs.

Teams already through: None through qualifying - Canada, Mexico and United States automatically as co-hosts.

The Concacaf qualifying takes a different look, with three of their biggest hitters not involved as they have qualified as hosts - but still plenty of spots up for grabs.

Twelve teams are involved in a third round of qualifying which started this month.

The winners of each group go to the World Cup and the two best-ranked runners-up going into the intercontinental play-offs.

Suriname, Curacao and Haiti currently lead the three groups.

Qualifying places: 16.

Teams already through: None.

There are 12 groups - with the winners of each group qualifying for the World Cup and the 12 runners-up going into play-offs with the four best-ranked Uefa Nations League group winners that have not already qualified - for four extra places.

Europe is the only continent that does not have a team in the intercontinental play-offs.

Qualifying started in March - with some teams not even playing their first qualifiers until this month because of the Nations League.

The groups end in November, with the play-offs in March 2026.

Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Belgium, England and Croatia are the current group-stage leaders.

Qualifying places: One, plus one nation into intercontinental play-offs.

Teams already through: New Zealand.

Oceania qualifying has already ended - with New Zealand beating New Caledonia 3-0 in the final.

New Zealand go through to the World Cup automatically, as a result of the expanded World Cup. Oceania usually only gets a play-off spot.

New Caledonia, a French overseas territory, will take part in intercontinental play-offs in March 2026 - featuring teams from Africa, Asia, South America and North America - with two out of six teams going through.

Asia's next two places will be confirmed in October, with the winners of the two fourth-round groups qualifying.

Four European nations could book their place this week - England, Portugal, Switzerland and France.

The Three Lions will qualify with a win over Latvia on Tuesday, while the other three must rely on other results too.

Croatia are all but there, sitting three points above the Czech Republic with a far superior goal difference.

In Africa, three more places will be decided this month from the final rounds of qualification matches.

Senegal need to beat Mauritania on Tuesday or hope Democratic Republic of Congo fail to beat Sudan in their Group B ties.

Leaders Benin, who hold a two-point lead in Group C, must beat second-placed Nigeria to ensure qualification. Third-placed South Africa, who were docked three points for fielding an ineligible player earlier in the campaign, could still catch them.

A point separates Ivory Coast and Gabon going into the final match of Group F, but victory over Kenya would seal a spot for the Elephants.

Two places will go to the six teams in the intercontinental play-offs that are played in March 2026. Bolivia and New Caledonia are the confirmed entrants so far.

Let's dive into the details: The list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.

There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.

Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. 

The documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. 

In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: "What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?"

In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  "I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose", adding that a "peaceful island experience" is the opposite of what he's wanting.

Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to "smear my name", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of "those who committed serious crimes with Epstein". 

Two emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. 

One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates "to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls".

In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.

"I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?" she said.

"At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women."

Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: "These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false."

The US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. 

Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.

The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.

Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.

Photographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.

In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.

No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.

Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Richard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. 

In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was "really nice" seeing him, adding: "Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!"

Virgin Group has clarified that "harem" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. 

Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was "only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event".

The statement added: "When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.

"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims."

Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.

An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: "I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo."

In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a "quick cup of tea", that includes the lines: "My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you." 

Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.

Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. 

The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.

In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting "anything you can help me with". 

Epstein replied: "I will wire your loan amount immediately".

A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, "thrilled to host and sad I'm not there".

Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for "ever having known Epstein" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he "was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.

The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.

Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.

One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting "first we need to push back on the lies" and "rebuild your image as philanthropist". 

Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.

An October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. 

After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: "Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl."

"Who wouldn't," Epstein texts back. "You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters."

Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Billionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release.

In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: "We are looking forward to visiting you", and, "We would love to join you for lunch". 

Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that "Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing".

Larry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.

In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. 

"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is," Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.

Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took "full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. 

Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.

In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a "civilian".

In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a "present" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as "tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic".

Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein "had a brief association", adding that he "did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island".

The director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files.

Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.

Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.

The anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. 

In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.

He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.

Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was "involved in any criminal activity", adding that " I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties".

The chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.

Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: "I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?"

Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.

Response: Wasserman said in a statement: "I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light." 

Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.

He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: "Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed", and, "Look forward to seeing you". 

Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.

One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. 

Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. 

Noam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. 

In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should "defend myself" or "try to ignore".

A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments "the horrible way" Epstein was treated and the "hysteria that has developed about abuse of women".

"It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it," the email said.

Response: The appearance of Chomsky's name in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Chomsky's wife Valeria, who is his spokesperson, for comment.

Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.

In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: "The draft motion is in great shape." 

Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal.

Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: "Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm." The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.

In the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.

Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.

Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. "They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be," he said.

"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first," he said.

In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. 

"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know," he said. "And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee."

Clinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee later this month, and has called for the hearing to be public.

The files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.

In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.

"Come to Israel with us," Chopra says. "Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love"

In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: "Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise."

Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: "God is a construct. Cute girls are real."

Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: "Did you find me a cute Israeli?"

Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was "deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case" and denied his involvement in "any criminal or exploitative conduct."

"Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors."

The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.

Here’s what you need to know: Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City are among the WSL clubs involved in the trial

Trials providing supporters with the option to consume alcohol in the stands at Women's Super League games have received positive feedback on fan safety.

This weekend marks 100 fixtures since WSL Football's latest scheme began, with 15 of 26 clubs across England's top two tiers involved.

Another three clubs - Tottenham, Leicester City and Nottingham Forest - will join for the rest of the season.

A survey involving 4,270 fans was conducted by WSL Football and rated experiences on a scale of 1-10.

The average number for fan safety was 9.4 out of 10, while 70% of fans were in favour of alcohol at games.

That figure is up from 58% last summer, when WSL 2 clubs Southampton, Birmingham, Newcastle and Bristol City were involved.

WSL fans were also asked about the family-friendly environment at games, with an average score of 9.1, while a sense of atmosphere was rated 8.6.

"We got some initial feedback from fans (last summer) that was really positive, so we invited remaining clubs across the WSL and WSL 2 to expand it," Hannah Buckley, head of infrastructure, safety and sustainability at WSL Football, told BBC Sport.

"One of the main things we learned throughout this process is that it is about giving our fans the choice.

"It is a great example of the women's game being different to the men's game - both from a legislation point of view but also a chance to innovate and do some really cool stuff.

"It was putting the choice back in the fans' hands and letting them tell us what they think. You don't know unless you have tried these things."

Extra: Hannah Buckley on WSL stadium changes

WSL and WSL 2 clubs are not prohibited by the Control of Alcohol Act, which prevents the consumption of alcohol in view of the pitch in the men's game. 

However, competition rules implemented by WSL Football currently mean it can only trial it. That is under review by shareholders and could change soon.

"We will get to the end of the season and survey again. We have our own League Cup final, so we can see the appetite from our fans then," said Buckley. 

"We will share those findings with clubs and go through our regulatory processes and make a decision on how the shareholders would like to vote.

"It's looking positive at this moment in time but you never know with these things. We have had good engagement from clubs all over the country."

There are still 'drinking free' zones in stadiums, but clubs are using innovation to grow fanbases and increase attendances in the WSL.

Supporters can experience a bottomless brunch at Saturday's match between Chelsea and Arsenal at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea also offered half-price drinks before kick-off for their opening game of the season against Manchester City.

Fans can buy strawberry Daiquiri cocktails at Goodison Park and Arsenal have held workshops this season to design the perfect matchday experience for fans.

"Every club has a different relationship with their food and beverage provider. It's testing and learning to find out what our fans want," said Buckley.

"Clubs have been brave enough to try it, the shareholders are listening to what we're doing, but, most importantly, we are being driven by fans' opinions.

"We're not saying to people to go to women's football and have a drink. We're saying if you want to have a drink, you can."

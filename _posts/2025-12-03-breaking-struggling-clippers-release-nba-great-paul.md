Here’s what you need to know: Chris Paul rejoined the Clippers in July after a spell with the San Antonio Spurs

The Los Angeles Clippers have released 12-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul following the side's dreadful start to the season.

The Clippers, who have lost 14 of their past 16 matches, announced Paul's departure before their match against the Atlanta Hawks.

Paul, 40, is regarded as one of the best players in NBA history and is competing in his 21st and final season in the league.

"We are parting ways with Chris and he will no longer be with the team," Clippers chief Lawrence Frank told ESPN.

"Chris is a legendary Clipper who has had a historic career. I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our under-performance. 

"I accept responsibility for the record we have right now. There are a lot of reasons why we've struggled. We're grateful for the impact Chris has made on the franchise."

In a post on Instagram, Paul confirmed his departure, writing "just found out I'm being sent home".

Paul and Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue had not been on speaking terms for "several weeks" before his departure, according to ESPN.

Paul spent six seasons at the Clippers from 2011 to 2017, before rejoining the franchise on a one-year deal in July.

Paul is second on the NBA all-time list for assists with 12,552, behind John Stockton's 15,806.

He is also second in steals with 2,728, trailing only Stockton's 3,265.

Paul has not won an NBA title, getting to the NBA Finals only once with the Phoenix Suns in 2021, when they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks.

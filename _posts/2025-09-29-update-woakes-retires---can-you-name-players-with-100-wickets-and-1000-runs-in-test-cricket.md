Experts revealed that All-rounder Chris Woakes has retired from international cricket following his omission from England's Ashes squad.

It brings to an end a fantastic 12-year Test career, so we thought we'd mark it with a delightfully difficult quiz.

Woakes is one of 72 players to have scored 1,000 runs and taken 100 wickets in men's Tests since World War Two. Can you name the other 71?

We've given you each player's nationality, Test career span, total Test wickets and total Test runs as a hint. You've got 30 minutes, good luck!

Stats correct as of 26 September, 2025

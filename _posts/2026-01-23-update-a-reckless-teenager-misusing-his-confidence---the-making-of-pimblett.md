Paddy Pimblett: The five moments that changed everything!

Paul Rimmer does not need to think long when he is asked about the day he met Paddy Pimblett.

On 20 January 2010 a 15-year-old Pimblett turned up at Rimmer's Next Generation Gym in Liverpool for the first time.

"I can remember the day I met him because he couldn't find the entrance to the gym and I gave him a bit of stick for it," Rimmer tells BBC Sport.

Sixteen years later Pimblett is drenched in sweat as he warms down from a training session among dozens of fellow fighters at that same gym.

Youngsters nudge each other in excitement as cameras are set up for Pimblett's interview with BBC Sport, while team-mate Luke Riley describes him as the "captain of the team".

Pimblett is no longer the kid who does not know his way around the gym - he is the figurehead among his peers and on the cusp of realising a career-long dream.

On Saturday at UFC 324 he faces American Justin Gaethje for the interim lightweight title at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

From unwavering confidence to an unselfish drive to coach and inspire others, BBC Sport analyses what has made Pimblett so successful.

After a floppy-haired Pimblett knocked out Luigi Vendramini on his UFC debut in 2021, he said during a charismatic post-fight interview: "I'm here to take over, lad. I'm the new cash cow."

Many UFC fans were seeing his unshakeable confidence and vibrant personality for the first time but, for the people who knew Pimblett best, it was nothing new.

"He's always been a good kid and very confident in himself. From day one he asserted what his goals were going to be," says Rimmer.

"He said 'I'm going to be the best ever. I'm going to be a world champion. I'm going to be the number one superstar in the sport.' He said that from day one."

Pimblett has always carried impenetrable self-belief, but it is only through years of hard work and guidance under Rimmer that he has been able to weaponise it.

"Teenage Paddy the Baddy was reckless," Pimblett tells BBC Sport.

"He did whatever he wanted to do. He didn't listen to anyone else - no-one else knew better than him."

'I'm a harder puzzle for Gaethje than Khabib'

I couldn't see, taste or smell for years - Gaethje

In 2017 Pimblett had suffered defeat by Nad Narimani for the Cage Warriors featherweight title, before losing to Soren Bak the following year when fighting for lightweight gold.

"It shaped me - made me who I am. Without them I probably wouldn't be where I am today," adds Pimblett.

Rimmer says Pimblett's confidence was at one point his "main weakness" because he would ignore coaching instructions, but by learning to be more attentive he has turned it into his biggest strength.

Since joining the UFC in 2021 Pimblett has won all seven fights to set up an interim title bout with 37-year-old Gaethje.

"If I say to Paddy, 'I'm the best at snakes and ladders', he's going to be playing snakes and ladders for eight hours until he beats me," says Rimmer.

"He's got a great mind and fight IQ, but his self-belief and confidence sets him apart.

"I have met people that confident before, but not someone who has that drive and work ethic. I can count on one hand the amount of days he's had off."

'Everyone underestimates me' - Pimblett

Just down the road from Pimblett's gym is a mural of former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson holding the Premier League and Champions League trophies he won during his distinguished career at the club.

Henderson is known for his leadership, work ethic and ability to lead by example - all traits which Pimblett has developed as a fighter.

Rimmer refers to Pimblett as a "fourth coach" at the gym, alongside himself, Ellis Hampson and Adam Cullen.

"A lot of gyms aren't teams. They're not all there for the benefit of each other. Some of them are just there for themselves," says Rimmer.

"But Paddy isn't one of them guys. He's coaching youths who have their first fight coming up while he's got his big fight coming up against Gaethje."

Pimblett is a star attraction at Next Generation, with Rimmer noting "we've had kids coming in with his haircut for years", but leaves his ego at the door.

It mirrors Pimblett's fight-night routine, where as soon as he steps inside the octagon, the showmanship and charisma disappear to be replaced by focus and maturity.

Pimblett sets an example for team-mates such as Riley, who knocked out Bogdan Grad on his UFC debut in November.

"He's been very important to me," Riley tells BBC Sport.

"I'm in the gym with him every day being one of his main sparring partners.

"It would be inspirational if he walked back in here a champion - it would motivate the gym even more. To see the captain with the gold is what we need."

The interim title bout with Gaethje was set up by the UFC after champion Ilia Topuria announced he would not be fighting early this year while he deals with personal issues following his divorce.

Some fans and pundits have questioned whether Pimblett deserves a title shot, but to him and the people closest to him, it was inevitable.

He has been manifesting it for years through his self-confidence, hard work and leadership.

"I have a saying - there's no point being nervous when you know you're going to win. So what's pressure?" says Pimblett.

"Keep doubting because it's people like you who push me forward. I love the people that doubt; I love the haters. So keep hating and I will keep proving you wrong."

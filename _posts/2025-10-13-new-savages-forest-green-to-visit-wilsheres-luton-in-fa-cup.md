Experts revealed that Eighty teams will compete in the first round of the FA Cup

Robbie Savage's Forest Green Rovers will visit Jack Wilshere's Luton Town in the FA Cup first round.

Former Arsenal and England midfielder Wilshere, 33, was named as Matt Bloomfield's successor at Kenilworth Road earlier on Monday.

Eighth-tier Maldon & Tiptree will travel to League One Port Vale, while 2013 winners Wigan Athletic host Hemel Hempstead Town of the National League South.

Essex-based side Maldon & Tiptree are the lowest-ranked team remaining in the competition.

The Jammers currently lead the Isthmian League North Division - 103 places below third-tier Port Vale in the English football pyramid. 

Elsewhere, Tom Cleverley's Plymouth Argyle will take on Wycombe Wanderers at Home Park, with Huddersfield Town travelling to Bolton Wanderers in three all-League One ties.

Vertu Trophy holders Peterborough United are at home to Cardiff City, while Oldham Athletic host Northampton Town and Crewe Alexandra will face Doncaster Rovers.

Should seventh-tier Gainsborough Trinity beat Hartlepool United in their fourth qualifying round replay, the Lincolnshire side will welcome League Two Accrington Stanley to The Northolme.

The ties will be played across the weekend of Saturday, 1 and Sunday, 2 November.

Holders Crystal Palace and the rest of the clubs playing in the Premier League and Championship will enter the competition in the third round.

"That's what we did. We threw enough punches tonight to get a 'W'."

Gilgeous-Alexander, the NBA's Most Valuable Player, added five rebounds and  eight assists.

The Thunder's Jalen Williams scored 19 points, Aaron Wiggins had 18 and Chet Holmgren recovered from a disappointing six points in game one to score 15 points with six rebounds.

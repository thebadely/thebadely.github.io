India win the final ODI by 13 runs at Chester-le-Street to seal 2-1 series win

Legendary former bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt questioned the mindset of some of England's players during their defeat by India, suggesting sometimes they look "lazy".

After India piled up 318-5, England slid to a 13-run defeat at Chester-le-Street as the tourists clinched the series 2-1.

Sciver-Brunt, England's record wicket-taker, was a notoriously vocal player on the field and suggested the team were lacking similar characters.

"I wouldn't say that nobody in this team wants it, they all want it and to do their best," she told BBC Test Match Special.

"There is a lot of timid people and not many front-footed people who are willing to do anything."

There were a number of misfields in India's innings - a regular problem for the current England team.

Sciver-Brunt, wife of England captain Nat, said players "don't want the ball because they are scared to fail".

"I played with a lot of passion and it certainly wasn't on the inside - you can see what I felt a lot of the time," she said. "I put a lot of pride into what I did, everything was life and death.

"It's hard for me to understand some people sometimes and their attitudes because to me it looks lazy and they are not trying and don't care as much."

While Sciver-Brunt did not name any players, she said she "sometimes" sees such attitudes in the current set-up.

"I don't think everyone is doing everything they possibly can," Sciver-Brunt added.

"And the key to that question is why? I don't think there is anything malicious in that - it is a mental thing. We just need to be stronger internally and be more outwards with our fight."

Asked about the comments afterwards, Nat Sciver-Brunt said "everyone on that pitch is committed to doing the best they can for England".

"I have actually been in that situation before when I was a lot younger - 'oh she is so relaxed, doesn't look like she is that interested'.

"On the inside that is not what is true. From the outside people might look in different ways but you never know what it going on on the inside."

Playing for the first time under Nat Sciver-Brunt and new coach Charlotte Edwards, England swept aside West Indies at the start of the summer but the defeat by India follows the loss in the T20 series this month.

Asked about her former team-mate's comments, Edwards added: "I couldn't be happier with where the squad is at in terms of their attitude and effort and professionalism.

"That was something I made very clear when I came into this role and I couldn't be happier."

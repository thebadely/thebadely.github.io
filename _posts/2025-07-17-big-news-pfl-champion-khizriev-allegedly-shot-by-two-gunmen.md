The Professional Fighters League says it is "aware of the situation concerning Timur Khizriev" after a video posted online appears to show the Russian featherweight champion being shot multiple times.

The footage shows Khizriev, 29, being attacked by two gunmen as he exited his car in Makhachkala, Russia.

Despite being shot, Khizriev grapples with one while the other fires at close range, before escaping further harm by fleeing the scene.

Khizriev is in stable condition, according to Russian media reports, but suffered numerous injuries to the shoulder, hand, and chest, and is undergoing surgery.

"PFL is aware of the situation concerning Timur Khizriev, and remain in close touch with his representatives," the mixed-martial arts promotion said in a statement.

"Our thoughts are with him and his family during this time."

Khizriev has won the first 18 fights of his career and beat Britain's Brendan Loughnane in November to win the PFL's featherweight tournament.

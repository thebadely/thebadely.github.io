Experts revealed that Ciara Mageean announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer in July

Ciara Mageean has expressed her gratitude for the "kind words of support" she received during chemotherapy treatment.

The European champion and two-time Olympian from Portaferry in Northern Ireland revealed in July that she had been diagnosed with cancer. 

Mageean, 33, posted on Instagram on Thursday to share what she called "a little life update" accompanied with pictures of family and friends over the festive period.

"I finished my 12th round of chemo just before Christmas, which meant I had a lovely chemo free Christmas with my family," she said.

"The past few months have been a mixed bag of cuddling Sam our wee springer spaniel on the sofa, and spending time with my nearest and dearest when my energy returned. Without them I would be lost."

The middle-distance runner added that she had "shed so many tears" reading the messages of support since the news of her diagnosis. 

"I want to say thank you to everyone who has sent me such kind words of support over the past few months," she added.

"I've shed so many tears reading your beautiful messages, on those tough days they really gave me a lift so thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

"I still have a long road ahead but for now I'm continuing to find the joy in everyday."

Mageean has won gold, silver and bronze medals in the 1500m at the European Championships.

After recovering from a serious ankle injury, she came third in 2016 and was a runner-up in 2022 before topping the podium in Rome for Ireland in 2024.

Mageean made her Olympic debut in Rio in 2016 and competed at the delayed 2021 Games in Tokyo, where her preparations were hampered by a calf issue.

She was set to race at the Paris Olympics in 2024 as a reigning European champion but an Achilles injury ruled her out on the eve of her 1500m heat.

Mageean's stellar career has also included a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, fourth place at the World Championships in 2023, and Irish records in the 800m, 1,000m, 1500m and mile.

She was named the 2023 BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality of the Year after an impressive year, in which she broke national records and was fourth in a competitive World Championships final.

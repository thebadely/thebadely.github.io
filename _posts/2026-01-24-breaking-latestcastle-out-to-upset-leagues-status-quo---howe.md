It has been recently reported that Newcastle United have not lost at home against Aston Villa since 2005

Head coach Eddie Howe believes Newcastle United can still achieve "great things" despite the constraints of financial rules as his side look to upset the Premier League's status quo.

Clubs who spend the most on wages have traditionally picked up the most points per game.

But both Newcastle and Sunday's opponents Aston Villa have bucked that trend in recent years with the eighth and sixth-biggest salary bills in the top flight respectively.

Newcastle qualified for the Champions League in 2023 and 2025, while Aston Villa followed suit in 2024.

Both are bidding to do so again this season and Howe's men could move up to fourth with a victory against third-placed Villa if results elsewhere go their way.

"People much cleverer than me will say that the wage bill follows the league position, but I can't think that way," said the Newcastle boss.

"We have got to think differently and find ways to still win games to upset the status quo and finish as high as we can.

"That will always be my belief, and that was my belief from day one in management. Football is played on the pitch - not with the money."

It is worth noting Newcastle's net spend on new signings last summer was Â£100m-plus, but they sold star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British transfer record fee of Â£125m.

Targets such as Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko also opted to join Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United respectively rather than move to St James' Park.

Although Newcastle are majority owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, legacy clubs - also including Arsenal and Tottenham - have the ability to spend more within the rules on account of their superior income streams.

Analysis from financial firm Deloitte revealed Liverpool generated Â£367m more in revenue than Newcastle last season, and Howe recognised his side have "a long way to go" on that front.

"I know people are bored of us talking about it, but it's factual," he added. "Building our revenues will be so important, and I know there's a lot of work behind the scenes to do that.

"I have always had the belief that, whatever situation you have, you have to try to outperform your resources. You have to try to overachieve. You have to stretch every ounce of energy and effort from the squad that you have.

"We believe we can still achieve great things - regardless of what financial restrictions there are on us."

Overall squad costs from the 2026-27 league campaign will be limited to 85% of a club's revenue, while teams competing in Europe will have to adhere to Uefa's maximum of 70%.

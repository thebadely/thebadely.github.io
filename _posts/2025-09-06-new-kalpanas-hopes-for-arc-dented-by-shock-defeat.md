According to new developments, Kalpana finished second to Calandagan in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July

Kalpana is no longer the favourite for next month's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe after an odds-on defeat by Giavellotto at Kempton.

Andrew Balding's four-year-old was around 6-1 favourite for Europe's richest race  on 5 October but is now out to 12-1.

King George runner-up Kalpana, ridden by Colin Keane, was beaten by a length and a half by Giavellotto in the September stakes.

The winner was guided home by Oisin Murphy on his 30th birthday for trainer Marco Botti.

Balding indicated afterwards that a decision on whether Kalpana would run in the Arc at Longchamp in Paris has yet to be made.

Big Mojo ran out a 16-1 winner in the Sprint Cup at Haydock.

Trained by Mick Appleby and ridden by William Buick, Big Mojo had finished a narrow second in the July Cup on his penultimate run but came with a late burst to triumph this time.

Last year's second, Kind Of Blue, filled the runner-up spot again.

Fellow Wathnan Racing-owned runner Flora Of Bermuda was third while favourite Lazzat finished unplaced in the same colours.

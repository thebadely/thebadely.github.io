Scotland missed the chance to seal their place at this summer's Women's T20 World Cup by emphatically losing to Bangladesh in their penultimate Super Six qualification game in Nepal.

Bangladesh, who have already qualified, won by 90 runs in Kirtipur but Scotland have their destiny in their hands and will reach the tournament proper if they beat the United States on Sunday.

The winner of Friday's late game between the US and Thailand will still have a chance to finish ahead of Scotland on net run rate if they also win their final match on Sunday.

Thailand face Ireland - who are level with Scotland on four points but with a better run rate in the Super Six table after beating the Netherlands - on Sunday.

The top four in the Super Six table qualify for the tournament - which is being held in England from 12 June - with Bangladesh and the Netherlands already assured of their place.

In Kirtipur, Dilara Aktar and Juairiya Ferdous put on 67 for the first wicket off seven overs and that foundation was added to in explosive fashion by Bangladesh's middle  order.

Captain Nigar Sultana made an unbeaten 56 off 35 balls while Sobhana Mostary smashed 47 off 23 as Bangladesh racked up 191-5 off their 20 overs.

Scotland's bowling figures did not make pretty reading but captain Kathryn Bryce conceded only 20 from her four overs amid the Bangladesh blitz. 

In reply, Darcey Carter was dismissed from the first ball of the innings and Scotland then slumped to 35-5.

Megan McColl (20) and Pippa Sproul (27no) added some respectability to the scorecard as the Scots limped to 101-9 from their full allocation.

Scotland finished second in Pool B in the initial group phase - losing only to the Netherlands - to qualify for the Super Six and Ireland did likewise from Pool A, with their only defeat against Bangladesh.

In the Super Six phase, countries play the teams they did not face in the group stage.

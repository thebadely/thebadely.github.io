Here’s what you need to know: Dozens of protesters have been arrested under the Terrorism Act at a series of pro-Palestine demonstrations held across England.

Campaign group Defend Our Juries organised demonstrations in 10 locations on Saturday, including Bristol, Manchester and Birmingham. 

The organisers said they were protesting "against our Government's complicity in genocide and against the ban on [direct action group] Palestine Action". Palestine Action was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 in July.

In Bristol city centre, 31 people were arrested, while in Manchester, 34 were held at a rally attended by 200.

In Birmingham, 25 protesters carrying placards expressing support for Palestine Action were arrested at a rally in Chamberlain Square in the city centre, West Midlands Police said.

Ch Insp James Littlehales said: "We fully recognise people's right to demonstrate peacefully, and many people continue to protest in support of Palestine without breaking the law.

"But we will take appropriate action where people are breaching the law by showing support for proscribed organisations."

Greater Manchester Police said it had detained 34 protesters in St Peter's Square for suspected terror offences.

In Bristol, demonstrators congregated at College Green and 30 people were arrested on suspicion of displaying articles in support of a proscribed organisation.

One woman was held on suspicion of failing to provide details under the Police Reform Act, Avon and Somerset Police said.

Insp Ben Spence said: "The protest has now safely concluded and the police operation has been stood down."

Officers also arrested 10 protesters in Norwich. Norfolk Police said a group of people were being held under the Terrorism Act on suspicion of holding placards that showed support for Palestine Action.

A separate protest in London organised by the Palestine Coalition attracted about 100,000 demonstrators, the group said. 

Five arrests were made for suspected affray and Public Order Act offences, according to the Met Police.

Many of those gathered in the capital carried Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel slogans as they walked from Green Park to Whitehall.

Some set off green and red fireworks as they walked down Piccadilly in central London.

Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after Hamas-led militants based in the Palestinian territory attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251.

At least 70,100 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire was called on 10 October.

Here’s what you need to know: The Sunday Times says Nato allies were left "blind-sided" by US President Donlad Trump's threat of tariffs on governments opposing an American takeover of Greenland. The paper understands the the UK "was not warned" about the announcement. The Sunday Telegraph says Trump has declared trade war on Britain and describes the issue as the "biggest crisis" in US-UK relations Sir Keir Starmer has faced since becoming prime minister. The Observer calls the potential  tariffs a "humiliating blow" for the prime minister who has "risked political capital in trying to shore up the UK's special relationship with the US".

The Mail on Sunday claims to have obtained a private media plan for the former shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, while he was plotting to join Reform UK. The memo reportedly says he should be styled as "the new sheriff in town" adding his defection would be "the biggest" Reform has ever had. The Sunday Times is also said to have seen the documents. It says they include "handwritten annotations and tweaks that appear to have been penned by Jenrick himself". His team has told the paper he had no involvement in drafting the original document.

In an interview with the Sunday Express, the leader of Reform Nigel Farage describes Robert Jenrick's defection as an "historic moment" and something that marks "the coming together of the right". But "the danger", the Sun on Sunday says, is that instead of "attacking the failing government" Reform and the Conservatives are "too busy attacking one another".

Two royal relationships make the front pages. According to the Sunday Mirror, Prince Harry's return to the UK this week will not involve a meeting with the King. Sources insist the monarch's week is "packed with engagements". The Mail on Sunday reports that Princess Eugenie has "cut off all contact" with her father, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The Princess is said to be taking a dim view of his refusal to apologise to victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Mountbatten Windsor is reportedly "devastated" at the estrangement.

The Sun on Sunday leads on a race row surrounding the BBC programme The Apprentice. One of the contestants, 33-year-old Levi Hague, has apologised for anti-Muslim comments on social media. The BBC has described the remarks as "totally unacceptable". The production company behind The Apprentice says it will be reviewing the process of background checks.

The Sunday Times joins more than 100 people at a cinema in Reading to watch the Lords of the Rings films in a back-to-back viewing. The screening which lasts just over twelve hours had been arranged to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the trilogy. While viewers were not "venturing to the fires of Mount Doom", the Sunday Times warns that sitting down for the equivalent of a half a day meant fans may get headaches, eye complaints and some aches and pains.

Here’s what you need to know: Brighton currently sit eighth in the Women's Super League table

Brighton manager Dario Vidosic will take a period of leave for family reasons, the club have confirmed.

As a result, he will miss Brighton's Women's FA Cup fourth-round tie with Nottingham Forest on Sunday (13:00 GMT).

Assistant head coach Chris Roberts, supported by first-team coach Arthur Brammer, will take interim charge for the foreseeable future.

Roberts has previous experience as interim manager, fulfilling the role while at Everton at the end of the 2021-22 season.

Vidosic joined Brighton in 2024 and led them to a fifth-place finish in the Women's Super League in his first season at the club.

"As a club, our priority is to support Dario at this difficult time. We ask that his and his family's privacy is respected," Brighton's women's and girls' managing director Zoe Johnson said in a statement.

"Chris and Arthur will have the full backing of the players, staff and the wider club during this interim period."

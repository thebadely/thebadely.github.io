Experts revealed that Jorgen Strand Larsen signed a five-year deal at Wolves in September

Wolves have rejected a Â£33m bid from Leeds United for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.

The offer, with a further Â£6m in potential add-ons, came a number of days ago.

Wolves value Strand Larsen at about Â£40m and are willing to sell the Norway international, who has struggled in the Premier League this season, if they receive an acceptable offer before the transfer window closes on 2 February.

However, they are not pushing to sell, and as it stands the 25-year-old will be part of the squad to face Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday.

Wolves head coach Rob Edwards said: "He's been great, he's trained really well. He'll be part of the squad tomorrow, so no change.

"That's just all I'm looking at the moment, so seeing a player with a focus and a really good attitude.

"We're not under any pressure to sell at all. We want to try and be as strong as we can throughout this period now, so unless we feel it's the right thing for the football club, no-one will go.

"No-one's been knocking on my door. They've all shown a really good attitude and a desire to be here and train. But as long as that continues then it's pretty straightforward."

Bottom of the Premier League, Wolves are looking to reshape their squad before an expected relegation. Given Strand Larsen's poor form and deteriorating relationship with fans, he is expected to leave Molineux.

Strand Larsen signed from Celta Vigo, initially on loan, in 2024 and scored 14 goals last season before making the move permanent in the summer for Â£23m.

A hat-trick in the FA Cup against Shrewsbury this month took his tally to six goals for the season, but only one of those has come in the league.

Newcastle failed with bids of Â£50m and Â£55m for Strand Larsen in August.

Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Crystal Palace are among other clubs who have shown an interest in the player this month.

Wolves are also willing to let defender Emmanuel Agbadou leave Molineux and are in talks with Besiktas.

The Turkish side's latest offer is Â£13m, with Wolves looking for Â£17m for the Ivory Coast international who joined from Reims for Â£16.6m last January.

Midfielder Joao Gomes has attracted interest from Napoli and Atletico Madrid but could still stay at Molineux until the end of the season.

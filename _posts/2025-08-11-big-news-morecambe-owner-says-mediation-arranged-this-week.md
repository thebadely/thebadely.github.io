It has been recently reported that Morecambe had been due to start their National League campaign against Boston United on Saturday

Morecambe owner Jason Whittingham has said a mediation session with potential buyers Panjab Warriors is planned for Wednesday.

A session had been set to take place last week according to Panjab Warriors, who alleged Whittingham cancelled the meeting the day before it was due to happen.

In a statement, Whittingham said that the club were continuing to work with "a number of potential buyers" and that he expected to complete the process later this week.

"Key stakeholders of the club are regularly updated, as we along with our advisory team engage with buyers and remain fully supportive of the process," the statement added., external

"We will be appointing an interim board imminently to facilitate the final stages of the sale process."

Morecambe buyers claim owners cancelled mediation

Panjab Warriors have been attempting to buy the club for more than a year and have previously said they have put in significant funding in order to help finance the Shrimps last season.

Culture secretary Lisa Nandy wrote an open letter to Whittingham this summer urging him to sell amid a chaotic off-season, during which a separate bid was made for the club, but a deal has yet to go through.

Her letter came after the club were suspended by the National League for failing to comply with their rules, while Panjab Warriors also said in a joint statement that the club would shut last week if a takeover did not go through.

Morecambe, who were relegated from the English Football League (EFL) last season, were due to face Boston United on Saturday to kick off their 2025-26 National League campaign.

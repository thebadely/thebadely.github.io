Here’s what you need to know: The price of willow has forced the MCC to adapt its stance to batmaking

Changes are to be made to the Laws of Cricket to permit bats previously deemed illegal in an effort to make the game affordable for amateur players amid the rising cost of English willow.

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced an amendment, external to Law 5.8 entitled 'categories of bat' as one of 73 changes which will come into effect on 1 October 2026 as part of a new edition of Laws being published.

From that date the MCC will allow laminated bats - known as Type D bats - made with up to three wooden pieces to be used in open age recreational cricket.

Type D bats were only previously allowed in junior cricket but the MCC said it has taken the step in an attempt to slow the rising costs of bats around the world.

Lamination is typically where the English willow face is backed by cheaper and lesser-performing willow, such as Kashmir. 

Types A, B, and C bats are solid single-piece blades made from one piece of willow and it is expected that, at the top level of the game, bats will remain thus.

Bat manufacturers will also be allowed to use woods other than willow behind the face of the bat as part of the law change.

MCC Laws manager Fraser Stewart said the move comes following considerable time testing the bats in conjunction with manufacturers and any performance advantage from Type D bats will be "marginal at best".

"We felt if anything can be done for the lower levels of the sport that will help make it more affordable without changing the dynamics of the game then it's a sensible move to make," Stewart told BBC Sport.

Last year the MCC held a conference at Lord's which brought together key stakeholders to debate the future of bat making.

Central to discussions has been the reliance on English willow and the scarcity in availability of it, which has led to price rises in recent years.

Bat prices are said to have trebled following increased demand from countries in South Asia, with some top-end models costing close to Â£1,000.

"There's not really enough willow to go round," added Stewart.

"So it's about being as sustainable as we can, too. Let's try and use as much of the tree as possible. Let's try and be as sustainable as we can.

"Manufacturers have been very supportive of this. They don't want to be charging huge amounts for the bats."

BBC Sport understands the MCC are exploring bats made from alternative materials but are conscious of upsetting the balance of the game along with the possibility of increased risk of injury.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have previously suggested bamboo could be used instead of willow to make bats. 

Graphite-backed bats - banned in 2006 and withdrawn by manufacturers - have also be proposed as a solution.

The MCC said the "removal of gendered language" will be  "concluded" in the latest edition of the Laws along with "simplification" where possible given many readers will not speak English as a first language.

One interesting change which will become noticeable in multi-day matches is to Law 12.5.2 which is altered so that the final over of a day's play will not end if there is a wicket but will continue until the last over has been completed.

"This doesn't save time, which is the case at lunch and tea, as the remaining balls need to be made up the next day, and it takes the drama out of the game," the MCC said.

Under Law 4.1 junior and women's cricket balls now have tighter, standardized size and weight limits with three overall categories for the sport - sizes 1, 2, and 3 - ensuring consistency across all levels.

Other changes to the Laws include:

The change to Law 19.5.2 law removes 'bunny hop' catches by allowing a fielder only one airborne touch after coming from outside the boundary, after which they must stay completely inside the boundary for the rest of the delivery or a boundary is scored.

Law 27.3.1 now states the wicketkeeper's gloves can be in front of the stumps during the bowler's run-up, but they must be fully behind the stumps once the ball is released.

A captain cannot declare the final innings of a match as per an addition to the wording in Laws 15.1 and 15.2.

Clarification of a short run in Law 18.5.1 and 18.5.2 means batters can abandon a run without penalty if they simply change their mind and it's only illegal if the short run is deliberately deceptive. If it is deliberate, the fielding side is disadvantaged, and gets to choose which batter faces the next ball, removing any advantage for the batting side.

Law 19.8 now clearly defines overthrows as intentional throws at the stumps, distinguishing them from ordinary misfields, which are not counted as overthrows.

Law 20.1.1.1 now lets the umpire decide a ball is finally settled when it's stationary or in any fielder's hands - not just the bowler or wicket-keeper's hands - giving more flexibility in calling it dead.

The MCC has been the sole guardian and custodian of the Laws of Cricket since its formation in 1787.

Let's dive into the details: A number of Tuesday's papers carry photos of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with the Ukrainian, French and German leaders after their talks in Downing Street on Monday. The Times reports that a deal to release up to £100bn of frozen Russian assets in Europe - which could be used to help Ukraine with the war or with reconstruction - is only "days" away. The paper says the money is one of the few "cards" the Europeans have to use in negotiations with Washington.

The Daily Telegraph reports that Donald Trump's peace deal could be "on the brink of collapse" because of President Volodymyr Zelensky's insistence that Ukraine has no obligation to cede territory to Russia. It says that Kyiv will send a Europe-backed counter proposal to the US president later on Tuesday.

The Financial Times claims that former prime minister Sir Tony Blair is no longer being considered for Trump's so-called "board of peace" in Gaza after objections from Arab and Muslim states. The paper says the opposition is in part because of his support for the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. But a source close to Sir Tony has told the BBC that the board will be made up of "serving world leaders", so he does not qualify - but he will sit on a smaller, executive, committee.

Migrants crossing the Channel in small boats are bringing heroin into Britain on behalf of people smugglers, according to an investigation carried out by the Telegraph. It says asylum seekers are being offered free or "cut-price" crossings from northern France if they swallow packets of Class A drugs and deliver them to organised criminal gangs. The paper says it's shared its findings with the Home Office.

Most of the papers carry photos of the Queen visiting the studios in Bristol where the second series of the Disney+ hit Rivals is being filmed. Camilla was famously good friends with the late Dame Jilly Cooper, who wrote the book it's based on. The Mirror reports the Queen told the cast she "binge-watched" the first series while she was recovering from pneumonia. The Express says Dame Jilly herself had confirmed that the book's lothario, Rupert Campbell-Black, was inspired by her friend Andrew Parker-Bowles, the Queen's ex-husband.

Experts revealed that Littler repeated his win over Van Veen in the 2023 World Youth Championship final

Luke Littler produced a stunning display to thrash Gian van Veen 7-1 and win the PDC World Championship for the second year running.

The 18-year-old Englishman becomes just the fourth player to win the title in back-to-back years, joining Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson in that elite group.

His second victory in only his third appearance at Alexandra Palace also means that only Taylor, with 14, and Michael van Gerwen, on three, have more PDC world titles than Littler.

And while Littler may still be 12 shy of Taylor's PDC record, the kind of masterclass he put on against Van Veen is only going to increase talk that 'The Nuke' might just chase down what had seemed an insurmountable  achievement.

"It's very special," Littler told Sky Sports. "We've got to keep going, we've got to keep adding more titles. We can't stop here. We're still on this rollercoaster."

Littler averaged in excess of 107 for much of the match, eventually coming in at 106.02, to leave Van Veen - at fractionally shy of 100 - trailing helplessly behind.

Having moved into such a dominant position, Littler finished in style with a 147 checkout before letting out a roar as he turned to a crowd that had backed him throughout the final.

With the Â£1m prize money secured, tears flowed as he was congratulated by Van Veen before he was handed the Sid Waddell Trophy by Olympic cycling great Sir Chris Hoy.

Littler had a tournament-high 73 180s, with 16 in the final

Van Veen, who will rise to number three in the PDC world rankings and feature in the Premier League for the first time after his run to the final, began well in the biggest match of his life.

The 23-year-old Dutchman took out 116 for a 12-darter to win the first leg on his way to taking the opening set.

But that was as good as it got for him as Littler turned it on. Checkouts of 145 and 127 to start the second set were not enough for Van Veen as his teenage opponent came back and levelled up with a 116 out of his own.

It got better for the champion as he clinched the third set by reeling in the big fish - a maximum 170 checkout - and then swept the fourth set to go up 3-1 having won nine of the previous 10 legs.

Van Veen tried to get himself going with a 137 to start the fifth, but the only thing that threatened to knock Littler off his stride was the return of the Ally Pally wasp.

Even that could not help Van Veen as Littler powered mercilessly on, with a final big finish to seal his latest success.

"The scoring maybe tonight wasn't my greatest game in the whole tournament," Van Veen told Sky Sports.

"Luke wasn't in the mood to give me any more chances. He played phenomenally.

"I missed too many chances to make it an even game. That's why he's world number one by a margin now and back-to-back world champion."

Retaining his world title caps a remarkable year for Littler in which he has completely dominated darts.

He has won five major titles, including the World Matchplay to complete darts' triple crown, as well as the UK Open, Grand Slam of Darts and World Grand Prix.

"He just keeps improving and getting better and I still don't think we've seen the best of Luke Littler yet," former PDC professional Matt Edgar told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I think we're playing him down, I think he's better than what everyone says."

Speaking on Sky Sports, five-time World Championship semi-finalist Wayne Mardle said: "There's nothing he can't do on a dartboard.

"It was like Phil Taylor, when he played well, he won. When he plays well, he's winning. It really is about him at the moment.

"The format doesn't matter any more. He's just the best."

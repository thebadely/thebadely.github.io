It has been recently reported that Owen Farrell has made 17 appearances for Racing 92 since moving to the French club last summer

Saracens have held talks with Racing 92 about a possible return for former club captain Owen Farrell, Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall says.

Former England skipper Farrell moved to the French club last summer, having spent his career to that point in north London.

"I think there are some discussions with Racing as to whether or not they would release him from his contract," McCall told TNT Sports after his side's final day win over Bath.

Saracens are looking to recruit cover with Alex Lozowski set to be out long term due to an Achilles injury suffered at the end of March.

The club ended an inconsistent season sixth in the Premiership with their 36-26 victory over an under-strength Bath side at StoneX Stadium on Saturday.

It was just the third time Saracens have finished outside the top four since 2009.

Farrell, who has 112 England caps and has represented his country in three World Cups, was one of a number of senior players to depart the club last year including Mako and Billy Vunipola.

Saracens miss out on play-offs despite Bath win

Farrell won six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups with Saracens

Farrell made 256 appearances in a trophy-laden career in north London, winning six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups - including the double in 2015-16 and 2018-19.

His last match for the club was a 22-20 defeat to eventual champions Northampton Saints in last season's semi-final.

He has made 17 appearances for Racing this season as he has dealt with injuries and form.

"When Alex [Lozowski] got his injury up at Leicester, you are allowed to bring in an injury dispensation for that player because he's [going to be] out for such a long time," McCall said.

"We need to bring someone in in his position and someone who we can afford in this position, who's going to get a smaller salary than that player.

"We compile a list and as far as I know Owen's contracted to Racing, so he can only join that list if they are prepared to let him go."

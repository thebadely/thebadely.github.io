Here’s what you need to know: The Daily Telegraph leads on comments from the head of Britain's armed forces, ahead of the talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said "the West must not be cowed by Putin" when discussing peace in Ukraine. "Putin ready to make deal, says Trump", reads the Guardian's headline. The paper notes that the US president's suggestion that Moscow and Kyiv would "divvy things up" could concern Western allies.

The Financial Times says a feared "mass exodus" of non-doms has been allayed by the latest HMRC tax figures, which suggest the numbers leaving are in line with, or below, official forecasts.

The Sun's front page says shadow home secretary Chris Philp has called for the deportation of an Afghan migrant accused of making a social media video telling viewers how to kill their wives. According to the paper, the video has been reported to the police, and was filmed a few weeks before the man arrived in Dover.

"Cost of fat jabs to triple" reads the Metro's headline. The US pharmaceutical firm behind the weightloss drug Mounjaro is increasing the price of the jabs, according to the report. It says what is known as a "kwikpen", which contains four weekly shots of the highest dose, will go from £122 to £330. That would bring the annual cost for users to around £4330.

Experts revealed that Manchester City last won the WSL title in 2016

Manchester City's performance against Chelsea was so ruthless and so impressive it left manager Andree Jeglertz speechless in the team huddle afterwards.

With an 11-point lead at the top of the Women's Super League table, having dispatched their biggest rivals Chelsea 5-1 at the Etihad, it was barely believable. 

"That was the first time I said to the players - 'actually I don't know what to say'," said Jeglertz.

"I am proud of the performance and what they were able to do, and seeing the players enjoying the game. 

"There is this feeling that a lot of people were expecting us to perform and they managed it. It's amazing."

Chelsea, winners of the past six WSL seasons and the current holders of all three domestic titles, looked like a team in headlights, completed overawed by City.

It was confirmation that City are the best team in the country this season, that they are the champions in waiting, and only have to seal it mathematically.

'Sweet Kerolin' steals show as Man City move closer to title

Kerolin hits hat-trick as Man City end Chelsea title hopes

Brazilian international Kerolin netted a hat-trick, while Vivianne Miedema and Khadija Shaw added to the tally on an entertaining afternoon in Manchester.

Confidence oozing from every player, and Kerolin a bag of tricks and flair, it was a showcase of everything that has helped City carve out such a commanding lead.

They are chasing a first WSL trophy in a decade but Jeglertz could only laugh when asked if they had one hand on it already.

"I think that is very difficult to say. We showed today that we are definitely a team with great confidence," he added. 

"The pressure is there from [the media], saying that we've won the league, and the team is coming out and handling it marvellously.

"This belief the team has at the moment, that we will find a way to win, is a thing we can use in the future also. We have a couple of games left of the season."

The word 'consistency' is a favourite of Jeglertz's and it's been the key ingredient to their success this season.

His consistently calm demeanour - whether they win or lose - is one of the many positive traits of his management, and his side have mirrored it in their performances.

When the hype was dialled up to the maximum on Sunday, and City's supporters coming out in their numbers to prepare for an early celebration, the players kept to their routine, stuck to the gameplan, and embarrassed the defending champions. 

Jeglertz has given them flexibility in their playing style, urged his players to show personality and creativity, and made them feel like they are the world's best.

"I came to the club because I want to win something. I haven't done that yet even though we have done a lot of good things. We are only on our way," he said earlier this week.

In the past, City's title challenge has come undone due to inconsistency or injures to key players such as Khadija Shaw, Alex Greenwood and Lauren Hemp.

Shock defeats, or too many draws against teams in the lower half of the table have proven costly, but not this season.

Their 5-1 victory over Chelsea was their 13th WSL win in a row, they have scored in their last 28 games, and they inflicted the joint-largest defeat the Blues have ever suffered in the competition. 

Their star players have made the desired impact with Shaw leading the goalscoring charts again and Kerstin Casparij and Vivienne Miedema providing the most assists.

City could only have dreamed of being in this position when they finished 17 points adrift of Chelsea last season, missing out on Champions League football in fourth. 

And yet Jeglertz, as usual, is remaining calm. 

"We have a long way still to go. At the moment, winning creates confidence and we have been winning a lot. But this group still feels they can be a little bit better," he added.

"If you have that drive all the time you will always have good training sessions and challenge your team-mates. That is one thing. 

"I believe in people that feel involved in developing the game model - if they are part of that - they take a bigger responsibility on the field."

This is the furthest Chelsea have been from the top in the WSL since the final day of the 2018-19 season when they were 12 points behind Arsenal

When the full-time whistle went on Sunday, City's celebrations began. A roar erupted from the Etihad stands and players hugged each other.

It was a different story for Chelsea with the players' heads already bowed when Kerolin's third goal went in minutes after half-time.

It was a unique sight, seeing the champions on their knees and empty of emotion.

"I'm not worried [by the body language]. You just need to understand that when the team isn't in a good place with the dynamics, it reflects in the body language," said Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor.

"Right now we are not in the best place in terms of confidence because that's normal, we are losing games. That's not where we want to be. 

"It's always easier as a team to stay together when you are winning games. But you have to have the same mentality when you are in tough moments."

The drop-off at Chelsea has been immeasurable. From winning everything domestically last season without losing a game, to being 12 points off the WSL leaders and now in a battle for a Champions League spot on the 1 February, is calamitous.

Bompastor has never faced a scenario like this before. She came from Lyon, where she had led them to Champions League glory and consistent league titles.

In her debut season at Chelsea, she surpassed expectations and clinched the treble.

But now there are some questioning her position.

Asked if she was confident she will remain in charge, she said: "Really confident. I'm really honest. In the club, if people think I'm not the right person to stay in this job, then I'll be happy to go if they think that's the right thing. 

"But I will never give up. In football, I know sometimes it happens and you can be in this situation. I will always fight but the institution at Chelsea is a lot more important than myself."

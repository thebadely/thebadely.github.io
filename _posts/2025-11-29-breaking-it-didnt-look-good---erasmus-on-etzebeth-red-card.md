Experts revealed that Eben Etzebeth has won two World Cups with South Africa

South Africa head coach Rassie Erasmus admitted "the optics weren't great" after legendary lock Eben Etzebeth was sent off for an eye gouge against Wales.

The Springboks completed an autumn clean sweep by going on the rampage in Cardiff to score 11 tries in a 73-0 win.

Yet almost the final act of the international year was Etzebeth, who went over for the final score, being dismissed by referee Luc Ramos.

The 34-year-old was shown a red card for making contact with the left eye of Wales flanker Alex Mann with his thumb in a 79th-minute scuffle.

"I don't know what I can say that won't be controversial. It didn't look good and it was a justified red card," said Erasmus.

"How it happened and why it happened, and if he was provoked, I am not sure, but it's definitely not the way that we would have liked to end the game. I don't think that the optics were great."

Etzebeth, who extended his Springboks record when winning a 141st cap in Cardiff, looks certain to be given a lengthy ban.

His Sharks team start their Champions Cup campaign at Toulouse on Sunday, 7 December before a home game against Saracens and South African derbies over the festive period.

The world champions overpowered Wales in a fixture that was one-sided from the off.

Steve Tandy's reign has started with three heavy autumn defeats to South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina and a last-gasp win against Japan.

Wales have lost 21 of their last 23 Test matches yet Erasmus tried to offer some comfort.

"I feel that we have been building and building up, this was a controlled performance," he said.

"The Welsh are not guys that just roll over and take the shots, they fight until the end. This was one of the really clinical performances and us putting our soul out on the game.

"Wales have a great coach and will come back. We know it can change and in 1998 we beat them (96-13) and then lost in 1999."

South Africa finish the year as the number one side in the world after winning back-to-back Rugby Championship titles.

The Springboks have showcased their formidable depth and power yet Erasmus pointed to when they were ranked sixth.

"We were in that situation and people were burning jerseys, but the Welsh people are here," he said.

"There is the support and the players have the fight. Get one or two wins, get on a roll and things will change.

"I know that things changed from 2016, when we were nowhere, to 2019 when we won the World Cup. Anything is possible."

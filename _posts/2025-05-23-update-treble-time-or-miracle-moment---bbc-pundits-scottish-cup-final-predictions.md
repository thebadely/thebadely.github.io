Experts revealed that Scottish Cup final: Aberdeen v Celtic

Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Saturday, 24 May Time: 15:00 BST

Coverage: Watch on BBC One Scotland, listen on BBC Radio Scotland & Sounds, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app

It's almost time for the talking to stop.

But until Saturday at 15:00 BST, we can all still have a say on how the Scottish Cup final is going to play out.

Most favour holders and treble hunters Celtic, who could add to their record tally in the competition with a 43rd title

Aberdeen are aiming to in the tournament for the 10th time and for the first time since 1990, when they beat Celtic on penalties.

So, how do the pundits believe the Hampden showpiece will go?

How to follow Scottish Cup final on the BBC

Shaun Maloney and Scott Brown were rivals then team-mates

Scott Brown, former Aberdeen & Celtic player 

I think Celtic from an attacking point of view will have too much for Aberdeen. It's difficult to look beyond a Celtic win because of that threat. 

Prediction: Aberdeen 0-2 Celtic

Shaun Maloney, former Celtic player

I anticipate that this game could be tighter than recent meetings, depending on how aggressively Aberdeen choose to defend without the ball. 

In past matches, Celtic's full-backs have been crucial in initiating attacks, and given the one v one skill of their wingers, I expect them to create numerous big opportunities.

Aberdeen have quality players like Kevin Nisbet, Shayden Morris and Jamie McGrath, who can capitalise on spaces left if Celtic are not at their best without the ball. However, if the match unfolds similarly to previous encounters between these teams, Celtic are likely to score enough goals to secure the trophy and the treble.

Prediction: Aberdeen 1-3 Celtic

Inevitably there has to be goals. While it's hard to see any other outcome beyond Celtic winning against Aberdeen, especially when in Glasgow, there is always a tiny bit of optimism when it comes to fandom!

That said, making it through extra-time and enjoying a couple of goals is the best I could manage.

For a team that knows finding success on cup final day so well, Aberdeen will need to be ready to lay bodies on the line and hope that fortune favours them for any other likely outcome.

Prediction: Celtic win on penalties, 2-2 AET

Leanne Crichton, former Scotland midfielder

I anticipate a fiercely contested Scottish Cup clash between Celtic and Aberdeen, with both sides bringing high intensity and emotion to the occasion.

Aberdeen will no doubt be determined to end their season on a high and I expect them to throw everything at the game in search of a statement victory. However, Celtic's experience and quality, particularly in big matches under Brendan Rodgers, should ultimately shine through. 

With their attacking depth and composure in key moments, I'm backing Celtic to deliver another trademark Hampden performance and lift the trophy once again.

Prediction: Aberdeen 1-3 Celtic

Willie Miller, former Aberdeen captain & manager

Everything would have to go the Dons' way, though Celtic will be the biggest Scottish final favourites for some time and with a treble at stake everything to play for. 

However, it's a one-off game and the champions might be over confident!

If the Dons pull it off, it will be a major shock, but in football shocks do happen.

Prediction: Aberdeen 2-1 Celtic, Kevin Nisbet and Pape Gueye to score - they have shown in the past that they can produce special strikes

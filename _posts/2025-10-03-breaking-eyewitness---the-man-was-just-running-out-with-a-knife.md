Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Shocked eyewitnesses have described the "horrendous" scene as a car and stabbing attack left two people dead and three others injured outside a synagogue in Manchester.

Police said a car was driven at members of the public during the incident in Crumpsall and a man, named by police as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by firearms officers.

A delivery driver said he saw what first appeared to be a car crash before realising there was a man with a knife.

"We thought we could see a car that had crashed, so we just thought it was a normal collision, but when we got a bit closer we saw a guy bleeding out on the floor," he said.

"And then there was a guy in front of the car, he was lying on the floor, and there were a few people standing in the road."

The man, who gave his name as Gareth, told BBC Radio Manchester: "Somebody shouted 'he's in the school or the synagogue' and then as we looked over the guy had a knife and he was just stabbing the window, trying to get in [the building], and within seconds the police arrived. 

"They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen, so they opened fire. He went down on the floor and then he started getting back up and then they shot him again."

The attack took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, in a part of the city with a large Jewish community.

Police said a large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the immediate area was made safe before being evacuated.

A bomb disposal team was also sent to the scene due to fears the suspect was wearing an explosive device. 

Greater Manchester Police later confirmed that a suspicious device worn by the attacker during the incident had been assessed and found not to be a viable explosive.

Video shared on social media appeared to show police officers pointing guns at someone lying on the ground outside the front of the synagogue.

The armed officers shouted at onlookers to "get back" and "move on".

The man on the ground is seen starting to get up before there is the sound of a gunshot and he falls to the ground.

Another person was shown lying motionless on the ground outside the synagogue gates with blood near their head.

Another witness, Shah, who lives behind the synagogue, described seeing a vehicle "just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public". 

"After that I had seen a man jump out and sort of running towards the people," he said. 

"It was a little bit traumatising to be fair. And then after that I slowed down a little bit just to see what was going on and to try and call emergency services. 

"And the man was just running out with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage.

"It's quite terrifying to be completely honest."

Local resident Olivia Gold said she had friends who attend the synagogue.

She told the PA news agency: "It would have been very, very busy. I live around the corner, but I've walked around to give support. It's now just police doing what they do.

"I came out to see what was happening because I heard three helicopters.

"It's just horrendous. We're a quiet community, just leave us alone. We don't want any of this.

"I think the response by police has been absolutely brilliant. They got here really, really quickly."

A security guard standing outside a synagogue on nearby Bury Old Road, just minutes from the synagogue where the incident happened, said worshippers there had been locked inside for their own safety.

Chava Lewin, who described herself as a religious Jew, lives next door to the synagogue.

She said: "I was outside and heard a banging sound and I thought it might be a firework.

"I spoke to someone who said she was driving and saw a car driving erratically and it crashed into the gates [of the synagogue].

"The second he got out of the car he started stabbing anyone near him. He went for the security guard and tried to break into the synagogue. He was in the courtyard.

"Someone barricaded the door. Everyone is in utter shock."

Another man said prayers had started when the attack happened but Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading the service, remained calm and he and others led the congregation to safety.

He added: "They are true heroes."

A shop worker in the area said: "There was a lot of confusion at first, people just didn't really know what was happening. 

"There was a lot of misinformation flying around over what it was. And since then it's been pretty quiet today because I think a lot of people are just staying away, staying indoors.

"News seems to be getting around now about what's happened but yeah, I think I think a lot of people are just in shock.

"We do get a lot of Jewish customers that come in. It's obviously going to affect them."

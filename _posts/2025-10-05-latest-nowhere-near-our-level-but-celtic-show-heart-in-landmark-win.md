According to new developments, Daizen Maeda's stoppage-time winner sparked wild celebrations at Celtic Park - but manager Brendan Rodgers wants more from his team

In the aftermath of his 200th win as Celtic manager, Brendan Rodgers was unequivocal about the unconvincing standard of his team's displays during their start to the season.

"We're nowhere near our level, I can be clear on that," he told BBC Scotland after his side came from behind to beat Motherwell in stoppage time to settle a five-goal Scottish Premiership thriller.

A disgruntled home crowd watched as Celtic were ahead, level and then behind before a gift from visiting goalkeeper Calum Ward allowed Benjamin Nygren to equalise.

But, with the Parkhead club heading for a third straight game without victory, Daizen Maeda's 92nd-minute header changed the mood.

Despite failing to reach the level Rodgers demands, the manager hailed his players' mentality as they extended their unbeaten league start and moved back to within two points of leaders Hearts.

"Clearly it's a very important win for us," he said. "The players showed an unbelievable amount of heart.

"We showed a real strong mentality and real competitive grit. Even though we're not at our levels we've shown in the past, you still have to win."

Rodgers praised the impact of his substitutions, with Nygren slamming in the 69th-minute equaliser that was gifted to him and Michel-Ange Balikwisha setting up Maeda for the decisive goal.

But the Celtic boss was keen to single out the match-winner for individual praise.

Japan forward Maeda has been a shadow of the player that netted 33 goals and provided 12 assists last term, scoring just twice in 12 games prior to this weekend.

Rodgers revealed transfer speculation has impacted the 27-year-old, who wanted to leave Glasgow in the summer.

A potential departure was seemingly blocked by the club hierarchy in a transfer window that sparked fury among the support.

The Celtic boss suggested the mood around the club is still not quite right but hailed Maeda's commitment following Sunday's win.

His hope now will be that the dramatic winner, and the wild celebrations that followed, can ignite another stellar run of form for the forward.

"For him and his family it's huge," Rodgers said of Maeda's winning moment. "There's no doubt everything in the summer would have had an effect on him. 

"For four years he's given everything, his heart and soul to this club. Naturally there was disappointment for him [in the summer] and I totally respect that.

"He's still turned up and he's working hard every single game. That there is a special feeling for him."

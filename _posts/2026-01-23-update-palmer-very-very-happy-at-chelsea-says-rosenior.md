According to new developments, Cole Palmer has scored five goals in all competitions for Chelsea this season

Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior says Cole Palmer is "very, very happy" at Stamford Bridge despite reports the England forward is homesick.

The 23-year-old grew up in Manchester and has been described as missing life in the north, external amid links to Manchester United.

Palmer is known to have been a boyhood United fan, despite coming through Manchester City's academy before joining Chelsea for Â£42.5m in 2023.

He signed a two-year contract extension in August 2024, which could keep him at the club until 2033.

Rosenior said: "I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems, and is, very, very happy to be here.

"He is a huge part of our longâterm plans, he's an outstanding player. Every player goes through difficult moments in their career with injuries, but that is no indication of his quality."

Palmer has cut a frustrated figure this season, having had to manage a troublesome groin injury.

Speculation intensified about his future after he barely celebrated scoring a secondâhalf penalty against Brentford and went straight down the tunnel following Chelsea's 2â0 Premier League win last weekend.

"There was frustration in the Brentford game - not because he isn't happy here, but because he couldn't perform at the level he wants to for the club," added Rosenior.

"My job, and the club's job, is to get him performing consistently at the level he wants to."

Palmer missed Chelsea's 1â0 Champions League win over Pafos in midweek with a minor thigh injury, but the Blues boss said they "will assess his reaction to training" before Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace.

Rosenior also confirmed number two goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen will miss out, although his injury is "not as bad" as first feared and he could be available for Wednesday's Champions League game at Napoli.

Midfielder Dario Essugo will be sidelined "for over a month" after "slipping in training".

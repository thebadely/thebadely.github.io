Here’s what you need to know: Hitman finished second in The Old Roan Chase in 2024 and 2022

Hitman, named after Ricky Hatton, won his first race since the boxer's death - and his first in three years - in the Old Roan Chase at Aintree.

The Paul Nicholls-trained nine-year-old finished two lengths clear of Master Chewy and co-owner Ged Mason said the Â£45,560 prize money will be donated to the Ricky Hatton Foundation.

"Absolutely delighted that we can help in some ways in Ricky's memory and legacy. The family have set up the foundation and the proceeds kick it off today," Mason told Racing TV.

Hatton was found dead at his home in Manchester in September, aged 46.

The two-weight world champion was nicknamed 'The Hitman' throughout his boxing career.

Hatton's long-term manager and friend Paul Speak watched on as jockey Freddie Gingell rode Hitman to victory at Aintree.

"Hopefully he's up there looking down and smiling at us," Speak said.

Hitman was bought by Hatton's friends Mason and former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2021 because of the name - though Hatton himself had an allergy to horses.

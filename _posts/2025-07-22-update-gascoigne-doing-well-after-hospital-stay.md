Experts revealed that Gascoigne helped England to a World Cup semi-final in 1990

Former England and Spurs midfielder Paul Gascoigne is "doing well" after a short stay in hospital, his representatives have said.

The 58-year-old was admitted to hospital after visiting the accident and emergency department on Friday.

His agency, MNT, said in a statement: "Paul voluntarily went to A&E on Friday (not via ambulance) after struggling with a throat condition he has had for a while. He went home yesterday after a short stay and is resting up and doing well."

The Sun, external had claimed on Sunday that Gascoigne had been "rushed" to an intensive care unit after he was found by a friend.

Gascoigne was capped 57 times by his country and is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers England has ever produced.

He began his career playing for boyhood club Newcastle United, before a move to Spurs in 1988 - where he won the FA Cup in 1991.

Gascoigne then signed for Lazio before returning to the UK where he played for Rangers, Middlesbrough and Everton.

Away from the pitch, Gascoigne has had well-documented struggles with alcohol addiction and depression since retiring in 2004.

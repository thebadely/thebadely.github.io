It has been recently reported that Andy Flower won The Hundred with Trent Rockets in 2022 and guided the Nottingham-based team to second this summer

Ex-England head coach Andy Flower has left Trent Rockets to take charge at London Spirit.

Zimbabwean Flower, 57, has signed a multi-year contract and replaces Australian Justin Langer at Spirit, who finished second-bottom of the eight-team table last summer.

It is the second high-profile appointment at the Lord's-based franchise since a 49% stake was sold to the Tech Titans for about Â£295m.

Earlier this summer, they named former England performance director Mo Bobat as their new director of cricket.

Bobat, who started in his new role on 1 October, holds the same role at Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and, together with Flower, helped them to their first title earlier this year.

Flower, who led England to their last Ashes win in Australia in 2010-11, has also worked in franchise competitions in Pakistan, the West Indies and the UAE.

What will The Hundred look like in 2026?

And so the revamp of The Hundred begins, the sign of what the competition may be like following more than Â£500m of investment.

The consortium that paid most for a stake in any of the eight teams, the Tech Titans, have poached the most sought-after coach on the franchise circuit. In doing so, they reunite Andy Flower with Spirit director Mo Bobat, the pair that finally delivered the Indian Premier League title to Royal Challengers Bangalore.

The last two of the eight investment deals were due to be completed this week and an announcement is thought to be imminent.

The Ambani Family, owners of IPL outfit Mumbai Indians, have paid around Â£60m for a 49% stake in Oval Invincibles. Cain International, co-founded by Chelsea owner Todd Boehly, is spending about Â£40m for the same share in Trent Rockets.

Flower's move could be the tip of the iceberg for players and coaches. The man he is replacing at Spirit, Justin Langer, would seem a natural fit for Manchester Originals, who have sold a majority stake to the owners of Lucknow Super Giants, Langer's IPL team.

In the men's competition in particular there is expected to be a huge shake-up of playing squads, with an auction then used to select players.

Franchises might be allowed to retain as few as four of their current playing group, possibly adding a limited number of direct signings before the auction. This would particularly impact the Invincibles, who have won the past three men's Hundred competitions.

Greater investment in The Hundred is expected to attract big name men's overseas players and one star attraction who could be involved in 2026 is Ravichandran Ashwin.

Whereas Indian men are barred from overseas leagues so long as they are playing international cricket or the IPL, legendary off-spinner Ashwin has retired from both. The 39-year-old is due to play in Australia's Big Bash this winter.

Ashwin's arrival could signal the arrival of other Indian megastars. Rohit Sharma is another who could be coming to the end of his time in international cricket and the IPL. Virat Kohli has a home in London, and London Spirit have just strengthened ties to his RCB.

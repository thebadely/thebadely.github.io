According to new developments, Premier Tech had sponsored the team for four seasons

The title sponsor of the beleaguered Israel-Premier Tech has ended its association, despite the team agreeing to remove Israel from its name.

The team had pledged to the change in October after public pressure from the Canadian company, citing pro-Palestinian protests during the Vuelta a Espana in September, many of which were directed towards Israel-Premier Tech.

Canadian rider Derek Gee had also cancelled his contract with the team days before the Vuelta, citing "serious concerns".

In a statement, agricultural products company Premier Tech said: "Although we took notice of the team's decision to change its name for the 2026 season, the core reason for Premier Tech to sponsor the team has been overshadowed to a point where it has become untenable for us to continue as a sponsor.

"Premier Tech has decided to step down as co-title sponsor of the team taking effect immediately."

Premier Tech had said in September it "expects the team to evolve towards a new name excluding 'Israel', leading to a new identity and branding for the team".

And whilst the team had been in the process of reorganising after owner Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams decided to step back from day-to-day operations, a new lead figure and structure was still set to be announced.

In response to Premier Tech's decision, the team told BBC Sport on Friday it was "unable to comment on the announcement made by Premier Tech".

The team added: "However, as sponsor discussions continue to take place, with existing and potential partners, the team is as motivated as ever for the coming season.

"An announcement regarding the new team identity and its sponsors is expected in the coming weeks."

Israel-Premier Tech have been targeted by pro-Palestinian protestors relating to the Israel-Gaza war, which was sparked by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed.

Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Although not directly referenced in statements, Gee said riding for the team "weighed heavily on his conscience", and said he is the subject of a 30m euros (Â£26m) damages claim for breach of contract from the team.

Gee, a popular figure in the sport, was considered one of the team's best riders, having finished fourth in May's Giro d'Italia.

Adams' involvement in Israeli politics is well known, telling BBC Sport in 2020 he is a "self-appointed ambassador to Israel".

He supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on a trip to the White House to oversee the signing of an accord between arab nations and Israel during US President Donald Trump's first term in 2020.

The protests during the Vuelta affected several of the 21 stages across the three-week Grand Tour, including the cancellation of the final stage in Madrid, when protestors blocked the course with barriers and some riders were pushed from their bikes.

On stage five during the team time trial, a banner was unfurled in front of Israel-Premier Tech as they approached at speed, taking four of eight riders out of the stage.

Alongside the concerns of Premier Tech, team bike supplier Factor also asked for changes to be made for them to continue their association with the team in 2026.

Lyon goes off injured after making a diving stop in the field

Injured spinner Nathan Lyon is a doubt for the remainder of the Ashes series while Australia captain Pat Cummins is unlikely to play in the fourth Test following the hosts' victory in Adelaide.

Lyon, 38, injured his hamstring while fielding on the fifth day of the third Test but Australia still completed a series-sealing victory.

Captain Cummins, 32, only returned to the line-up in Adelaide after missing the first two Tests as he recovered from a back injury. 

The fourth Test in Melbourne begins on 26 December (23:30 GMT, 25 December) and the fifth follows five days later in Sydney.

"Now that the series has been won, there might be a sense of the job being done, and let's reassess the risk," Cummins said of his own fitness.

"We'll work it out over the next couple of days. I doubt I'll be playing Melbourne, then we'll have a chat about Sydney."

Despite not having bowled since July, Cummins was excellent - taking three wickets in both of England's innings, including the scalp of the tourists' key man Joe Root twice.

If Cummins does rest during the fourth Test, he is likely to be replaced as captain by Steve Smith, who the hosts expect to be fit after he missed Adelaide with illness.

Lyon, who became Australia's second highest Test wicket-taker in Adelaide, immediately clutched his right hamstring and left the field and did not play any further part before returning on crutches to take part in Australia's celebrations.

"It doesn't look great," said Cummins.

"I don't know yet, but seeing someone on crutches doesn't really bode well for a Test a week away."

The 10 moments that decided the Ashes

The off-spinner took two wickets in the first innings in Adelaide and three in the second, having played a bit-part in the first two Tests of the series.

After bowling only two overs in the first Test of this series, he said he felt "filthy" after being left out of the second in Brisbane.

Lyon, one of the greatest spinners of all time, suffered a calf injury during the second Test of the 2023 Ashes, which was a significant factor in England recovering to draw the series 2-2.

There is no threat of an equivalent England comeback this time but Lyon's absence, which would likely mean an inexperienced spinner being called up in his place, would hurt their chances of securing a 5-0 scoreline.

"Gaz is pretty close to irreplaceable - the ability to take breakthroughs, but also control an innings is really important," Cummins said.

Cummins said the team had not spoken about going on to seal a series whitewash.

"It would be good," he said.

"I'll take 3-0. I'll take 3-2. The goal is to win the Ashes. 

"You don't go into a Test not wanting to win, so we'll go to Melbourne desperate to win that one, then Sydney. 

"If you get 5-0 it's amazing. I can't say that has been spoken about at all, just how we navigate to three wins."

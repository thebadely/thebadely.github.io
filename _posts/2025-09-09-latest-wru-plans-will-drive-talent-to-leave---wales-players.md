It has been recently reported that Wales ended an 18-Test losing streak against Japan in July

The Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) has told the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) that its proposals for the elite game would "drive talent to leave Wales".

The governing body is in a consultation period for its plans that threaten to cut the number of professional men's teams from the current four of Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets to two.

The WRU intends to announce a final decision at the end of October and that means the first block of the United Rugby Championship (URC) will be played amid uncertainty.

The WRPA met with the governing body on Monday evening and made it clear that it did not agree with what the WRU has termed its "optimal solution".

"The collective view of the players is clear: the proposed two-club model does not have their support," said WRPA chief executive Gareth Lewis.

Lewis says players believe it would:

Reduce professional playing opportunities in Wales, particularly for younger players.

Shrink the player pool available for the national team.

Risk alienating supporters and damaging the historic culture and rivalries that define Welsh rugby.

Limit development pathways and drive talent to leave Wales.

Dragons last week urged the WRU to rethink its plans, with chairman David Wright declaring "Welsh rugby deserves better".

The WRPA has followed that by encouraging the Union to come up with another plan.

"We feel it is important at this stage of the consultation that the strength of feeling among players is visible to all stakeholders and the wider rugby community," said Lewis.

"With continued interest from the media and supporters, we want to ensure the players' voice is clearly understood and contributes constructively to the ongoing discussions about the future of our game.

"Looking forward, players believe the future of Welsh rugby must be built on a model that protects playing opportunities, nurtures pathways, preserves identity, and strengthens the game for generations to come.

"We recognise the WRU's position that all options remain under consideration until the consultation with every stakeholder has been completed.

"The WRPA will continue to engage openly and constructively, working alongside the WRU, clubs, and wider rugby community to help shape a sustainable and successful future for Welsh rugby."

'This is about taking Wales back to the top' - Reddin

The URC gets under way on 26 September and the WRU aims to present its final decision to the board at the end of October.

Wales then play autumn internationals at Cardiff's Principality Stadium against Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.

WRU director of rugby and elite performance  Dave Reddin said in August that the governing body was hopeful there would be no repeat of the 2023 crisis that saw Wales' Test players threaten to go on strike for the Six Nations fixture against England.

"We want to closely engage with the players so that they understand the perspective and the opportunity," said Reddin when unveiling the plans.

"I would hope, and early indications are positive, that people really want to listen and be engaged in what a great Welsh system can look like.

"We want to work really closely and communicate with them because a strike would be a disaster for everybody. I experienced that with England rugby many years ago, and I don't think it would take our agenda forward."

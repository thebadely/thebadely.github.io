Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sir Keir Starmer's former chief of staff Baroness Sue Gray has challenged the government's plan to limit a civil service internship scheme to working-class students.

The Labour peer questioned the "evidence base" behind last month's decision to restrict a Whitehall internship to students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds".

The government argued the change will bring in "more working-class young people" widening the talent pool for a civil service that will "truly reflect the country".

But Baroness Gray told peers she was "from the most working class of backgrounds" but had "learned a lot from being around people from different walks of life".

From October 2026, Whitehall's main internship scheme designed to attract university students to the civil service will now only be available for students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds" - judged by what jobs their parents did when they were 14.

Those who are successful on the internship will then be prioritised for entry to the Fast Stream, the main graduate programme for entry to the civil service.

But Baroness Gray said: "As a former civil servant from the most working class of backgrounds, and I'm sure there are very good intentions here, I would have found it really difficult when I joined the civil service to not have a wider group that I actually was exposed to, and I learned so much from that.

"I would like to know what the evidence base is for actually reaching this conclusion, because I do think it's good intentioned, but I think there are other ways that the civil service can be opened up as well."

Labour minister Baroness Anderson of Stoke-on-Trent said this was one of the "rare" occasions she "disagreed" with Baroness Gray.

"This is not about stopping the civil service being a meritocracy. It is ensuring that the meritocracy is available to everyone, regardless of where you were born," she said

Earlier, Tory shadow Cabinet Office minister Baroness Finn pointed out that the current rules made clear a person's selection for work in the civil service "must be on merit on the basis of fair and open competition".

She said: "The changes proposed by the government to the summer internship programme would allow the child of a mechanic, an electrician or even possibly a toolmaker to apply, but discriminate against the child of a roofer, a taxi driver or a nurse, who would be deemed ineligible.

"Quite apart from dramatically reducing the range of talent, does she really believe that this is still a fair and open and indeed a sensible process?"

Baroness Gray, the daughter of Irish immigrants in 1950s Tottenham, grew up with a salesman father and a barmaid mother.

She joined the civil service straight from school after her father died when she was a teenager.

She became a household name as the Partygate investigator, and her critical report into Downing Street lockdown gatherings contributed to Boris Johnson's downfall in 2022.

She was poached from the civil service by Labour to lead Sir Keir Starmer's office as the party prepared for government ahead of the 2024 election, but infighting forced her out within 100 days of victory.

Since joining the House of Lords she has used her speeches to warn about proposed cuts to the civil service, criticising those who call public servants "pen pushers".

Making her maiden speech in the House of Lords, Baroness Gray said that the UK needs "public servants to succeed".

Here’s what you need to know: Cold Arctic air is set to sweep across the UK this week as communities in Wales recover from severe flooding that inundated properties and disrupted transport at the weekend.

Temperatures are set to drop, with yellow cold health alerts in place until Friday in northern and central parts of England. Snow is possible on higher ground in Scotland and northern England by Tuesday.

The cold snap comes as Storm Claudia moved away on Sunday after delivering more than a month's worth of rain in parts of England and Wales. 

People have rallied together to help residents and business owners recover from unprecedented flooding in Monmouth, Wales.

A major incident which had been declared in the area was rescinded on Sunday and four severe flood warnings - which warned of a "danger to life" - also ended.

The River Monnow reached record levels after the storm, exceeding those recorded during Storm Dennis in 2020 and Storm Bert in 2024. 

While that low pressure system has been replaced by mostly calm and dry weather, Monday could bring a few wintry showers on exposed eastern coasts. 

Highs of 5–10°C are expected across much of the UK in the coming days.

By Tuesday, low pressure brings rain and sleet, with snow possible in the northern half of the UK, particularly in mountainous areas.

England's yellow cold health alerts, issued by the UK Health Security Agency, warn of the potential for "significant impacts" across health and social care services. They are in place from 08:00 on Monday to 08:00 on Friday.

Midweek stays cold with brisk northerly winds, and sleet and snow showers are likely, mainly along northern and eastern coasts, as well as Northern Ireland, west Wales, and possibly the moors of south-west England.

The significant drop in temperature is due to a change in wind direction.

Since the start of this month, there has generally been a southerly wind bringing a very mild, but cloudy, tropical maritime airmass all the way from the Canary Islands.

This pattern will change. After being on the warmer side of the jet stream, the UK will be on the colder side of it.

Major flooding in Monmouth saw people rescued from their homes, with some evacuated to a library and a leisure centre. Hundreds of homes were left without power. 

As the waters receded, many buildings were left covered in a thick layer of sludge.

"It's dreadful," county councillor Martin Newell told the BBC. He said he had spoken to a resident who had "lost everything, all of his possessions", and that businesses would not recover before Christmas.

Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes said it was a "really worrying time" and that flood defences would need to be reviewed while the clear-up was under way.

Flooding has been less severe in England, but an ongoing risk remains, with 24 flood warnings still in place.

The weather also triggered major disruption on rail networks over the weekend. Most lines have since returned to normal, but disruption is expected to continue on some Great Western Railway and Transport for Wales services.

National Rail has warned passengers to check before they travel and the AA told drivers to avoid travelling in "hazardous weather".

Let's dive into the details: Christian Eriksen has won 144 caps for Denmark

Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen has signed for Wolfsburg after leaving Manchester United at the end of last season. 

The 33-year-old joins the Bundesliga club on a contract that runs until the summer of 2027. 

Eriksen made 107 appearances and scored eight goals across three seasons at Old Trafford, helping United win the Carabao Cup in 2023 and FA Cup in 2024. 

"Wolfsburg is my first club in the Bundesliga - I'm really looking forward to this new adventure. I'm convinced we can achieve something together," said Eriksen.

"I immediately sensed that [Wolfsburg manager] Paul Simonis has a clear vision for the team and for me personally.

"The fact that there are several familiar faces in the squad from the Danish national team makes Wolfsburg a particularly attractive proposition for me."

The playmaker, who suffered cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 and has also played for Brentford, Inter Milan, Tottenham and Ajax, had recently been training with Malmo after becoming a free agent.

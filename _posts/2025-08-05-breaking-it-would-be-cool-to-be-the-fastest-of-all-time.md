Let's dive into the details: Matthew Richardson will have to cycle more than 80km/hr to break nine seconds in the 200m flying lap

British sprinter Matthew Richardson wants to become the "fastest track cyclist of all time" as he aims to break the 200m flying start time trial world record in Turkey next week.

Richardson, who switched his allegiance to Great Britain from Australia after the Paris Olympics last summer, is attempting to break the record that stands at 9.088 seconds.

He is one of three British cyclists bidding to break records on the same track on 14 August, with Charlie Tanfield attempting the elite hour mark and para-cyclist Will Bjergfelt taking on the C5 category hour milestone.

"It has a nice ring to it, being the fastest track discipline," Richardson said. 

"There's no extra caveats to it afterwards - it's in a flat 200 [metres], you reached the highest peak speed possible on the track. It'd be cool, if I do it, to call myself the fastest of all time,"

Richardson, who was born in Maidstone, Kent and moved to Western Australia aged nine, won two silver medals and a bronze for Australia last summer before switching his nationality.

He won a trio of sprint titles at the British Track Championships at the start of the year, and followed it with two golds on his Great Britain debut at the Nations Cup in March, on the Konya track in Turkey where the new attempts will all take place.

Richardson briefly set a new flying 200m record at the Olympics of 9.091 seconds, before Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen broke it minutes later.

The 26-year-old said he was "confident" going into next week and that the record would fall below nine seconds soon - a feat that requires speeds of more than 80km/hr.

"I'm pretty confident that I'm in a really good place to get the job done," he said.

"It's a bit of a race between Harrie and I to be the first person to do it [break nine seconds]. It's been on my radar for the last couple of years as the world's got a bit closer and closer to going below nine."

Tanfield is aiming to become the fourth British man to break the hour record, registering the biggest distance cycled around a track in 60 minutes - since the UCI (International Cycling Union) changed the rules in 2014 - following Alex Dowsett, Bradley Wiggins and Dan Bigham.

The current record stands at 56.792km set by Italy's Filippo Ganna in 2022.

"I identified this year after the Games as a time when I'd have the freedom to give it a go," Tanfield said.

"I've been preparing for this since I started training again after the Games, so there's been months of training and learning to get to this point. On the day my goal is to execute the perfect ride for my ability, if can do that and put it all together I'll be happy."

Will Bjergfelt wants to be the first para-cyclist to break 50km distance in the hour record

Bjergfelt said the C5 hour record of 47.569km, set in 2014 by Italy's Andrea Tarlao, had been something he had wanted to attempt for a long time. 

The 46-year-old believes the advancements in technology over the past 11 years make not only breaking it achievable but also adding considerably to the distance.

"Aerodynamics have evolved massively, I feel I'll be in a very, very good place to forward the record on and push it on and make it something big again," Bjergfelt said.

"I definitely want to see if I can crack 50km, if so I'll be the first C5 para-cyclist to break that barrier. That would be something that's pretty special. 

"I want to put out there that if you do have an impairment or a slight disability there's so many amazing things that you can do that it shouldn't hold anyone back."

Bjergfelt made history in 2021 as the first para-cyclist to race in the men's Tour of Britain and he is back juggling full-time work as an engineer alongside racing after taking two years off to focus on cycling.

The hour record is known for being one of the most gruelling tests in cycling and Bjergfelt said the challenge is managing your effort to perfection.

"With the hour record you have to be really conservative in the first 40-45 minutes. You still want to be on a pace to beat the record but you have to be really within yourself, because it's an effort that comes back to bite you," he said. 

"In that last 10, 15 minutes that's where hopefully I'll be on pace to have broken the record and at the same time I'll still have enough in the tank to really extend myself in the last five minutes."

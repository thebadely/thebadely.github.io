According to new developments, Another recall notice has been issued in the UK for some baby formula products over potential contamination, with food safety experts asking parents to check batches they have at home.  

Food manufacturer Danone has recalled 14 more batches of Aptamil and Cow & Gate first infant and follow-on milks because a toxin called cereulide may make them unsafe for babies to drink.

The toxin can cause vomiting and stomach cramps, and 36 children in the UK are already suspected to have been affected by food poisoning.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says parents should check the batches listed on their website and stop using them.

Several manufacturers, including Nestle and Danone, have issued recalls of infant formula that could be contaminated in more than 60 countries since December.

These include batches of SMA, made by Nestle, and Aptamil and Cow & Gate, made by Danone. A total of 28 batches of baby formula products have now been recalled. Traces of the toxin were found in one batch of Aptamil First Infant Formula in January.

Danone and Nestle have given assurances to the FSA that recalled batches were produced some time ago and are unlikely still to be on UK shop shelves. However, they may be in cupboards at home, which is why parents and caregivers are being asked to check their supplies.

Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed by cooking, or when making the infant milk. If it's consumed it can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.

The FSA has already said the toxin was linked to an ingredient called arachidonic acid (ARA) oil in infant formula, which gives it some of the growth properties of breast milk.

A third-party supplier is the source of the contamination, the FSA said last week, which the companies are now no longer using.

FSA chief executive Katie Pettifer said investigations were ongoing.

"Food businesses have a legal responsibility to sell safe food, including checking ingredients from suppliers are safe.

"We are working with international food safety authorities on this global recall and expect manufacturers to explain what went wrong and provide assurances this will not happen again," she said.

A spokesperson for Danone North Europe said it "never compromises on food safety, and we want to reassure all parents that we take this responsibility seriously".

"All our baby formulas are produced under strict food safety and quality standards and undergo rigorous checks before leaving our factories."

They added that "low levels of cereulide" were detected in specific products, which have now been replaced.

The FSA said big supermarkets including Tesco and Co-op were still stocking unaffected products, so parents could buy formula safely at those retailers. 

"The affected batches are unlikely to still be on shop shelves but may be in your cupboard," Pettifer said.

"If you have an affected batch, do not use it. You can return it to the store and exchange it for an unaffected batch."

UK health officials say none of the children who had suspected food poisoning from contaminated baby formula are seriously ill. The infants had all consumed the specific brands of formula affected.

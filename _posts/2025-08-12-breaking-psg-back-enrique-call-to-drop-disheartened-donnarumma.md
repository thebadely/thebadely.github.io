Experts revealed that Gianluigi Donnarumma has been at Paris St-Germain since 2021

Paris St-Germain manager Luis Enrique says the club have backed his decision to drop goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma for the Uefa Super Cup.

The Italian was left out of the squad that travelled to Udine for Wednesday's match against Tottenham, with Lucas Chevalier and Renato Marin selected instead.

In a social media post, Donnarumma said he was "disappointed and disheartened" at his omission.

The 26-year-old was one of the stars of PSG's triumphant run to last season's Champions League title and the decision has come as a shock given his standing and profile.

Enrique said his decision was down to looking for a "different profile" of goalkeeper.

"I am supported by my club and we are trying to find the best solution," he told a news conference on Tuesday.

"It is a difficult decision. I only have praise for Donnarumma. He is one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man.

"But we were looking for a different profile. It's very difficult to take these types of decisions."

In a social media post later on Tuesday, Donnarumma said he was unsure he would  play for the Ligue 1 club again.

"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done," he said.

"If that doesn't happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me and I will never forget it."

PSG captain Marquinhos heaped praise on Donnarumma, adding: "It's always difficult, I've been here 12 or 13 years and I've seen other players leave.

"Unfortunately that's part and parcel of football. Only thing we can say is to give everything to the players until the last minute they are at the club.

"Players come and go but the history will always be here. Gigi is part of the history and we are proud of him.

"What he pulled off last season was incredible, we owe him a lot. If he goes, a huge thanks to him."

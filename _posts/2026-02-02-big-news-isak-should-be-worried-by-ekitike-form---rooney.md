Here’s what you need to know: Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike have combined for six goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Premier League duo

Hugo Ekitike's form gives Liverpool a dilemma when Alexander Isak returns from injury, says former Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney.

Ekitike, 23, scored twice as Liverpool came from behind to beat Newcastle at Anfield on Saturday, taking his tally to 15 goals from 32 games in all competitions this season.

It was an electric display from the France forward, who joined for an initial Â£69m from Eintracht Frankfurt and has struck up a good understanding with another of Liverpool's big-money summer signings, Florian Wirtz - a Â£116m acquisition from Bayer Leverkusen.

Rooney said their blossoming partnership leaves questions over where Isak - who completed a Â£125m British record transfer to Liverpool from Newcastle - fits in when he returns from his broken leg.

The Sweden international, 26, had scored three goals in 16 appearances for Liverpool before being sidelined in December.

"I'd be more worried if I was Isak, sat there watching," Rooney said on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, which you can now listen to on BBC Sounds.

"His Liverpool career just hasn't got up and going yet. Obviously they paid a lot of money for him and these two [Wirtz and Ekitike] seem to have a real good understanding of each other's game and they look like a real threat.

"Ekitike's second goal in particular was brilliant, it reminds me of Romario. A little toe-poke goal but it's instinctive.

"He is the type of player I like to watch. He's not a number nine, he's not a number 10. He drifts out wide, he gets on the ball, brings players into the game and he can score goals. So he's got a bit of everything really."

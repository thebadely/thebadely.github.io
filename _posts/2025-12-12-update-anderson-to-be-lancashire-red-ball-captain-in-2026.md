According to new developments, Sir James Anderson took 17 wickets in six Championship games in 2025

Lancashire have appointed Sir James Anderson as captain of their Championship side for 2026.

Anderson led the team in five games last summer and had a winning record but he has now been given the job full-time after signing a new one-year contract.

Now 43, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has taken 1,143 wickets in 304 first-class matches since his debut in 2002.

Josh Bohannon has been named as vice-captain while Keaton Jennings remains captain of Lancashire's T20 Blast team.

Despite playing his 188th and final Test for England in 2024 at the age of 41 in July 2024, Anderson has carried on his county career.

After a turbulent summer at Emirates Old Trafford in which head coach Dale Benkenstein left mid-season and Jennings stepped down as red-ball captain, Anderson found himself standing in as skipper when chosen replacement Marcus Harris returned to Australia.

He led the team to two wins, two draws and a defeat in his five games in charge and lifted the mood after a dismal start.

Now he will work alongside new permanent head coach Steven Croft, who was in interim charge for the second half of last season and a former Red Rose team-mate of Anderson, as they aim to lead Lancashire back to Division One after relegation from the top flight in 2024.

"Captaining Lancashire for the first time last season was a huge privilege, and I'm honoured to take on the role full-time heading into the new season," Anderson told the club's website., external

"We've got a fantastic group of players, a great blend of youth and experience, and I'm excited about what we can achieve together with promotion back to Division One our number one priority."

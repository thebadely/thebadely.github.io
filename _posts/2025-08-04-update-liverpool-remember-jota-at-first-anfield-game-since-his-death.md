Let's dive into the details: Liverpool legend Phil Thompson and Athletic president Jon Uriarte laid wreaths on the pitch before the first Anfield game since Jota's death

Liverpool paid tribute to Diogo Jota in their first match at Anfield since the late forward's death.

The 28-year-old Portugal international died in a car crash in Spain along with his brother Andre Silva, 25, in July.

The Reds played Athletic Bilbao in a double header of pre-season friendlies on Monday, with games at 17:00 and 20:00 BST.

Liverpool legend Phil Thompson and Athletic president Jon Uriarte brought wreaths out on to the pitch and laid them on the edge of the six-yard box before the opening game.

The billboards around Anfield read 'Rest in Peace Diogo Jota and Andre Silva - You'll Never Walk Alone', while fans sang about Jota.

Reds supporters also held up flags and banners remembering their number 20 - a number that has been retired by the club this summer.

Both sets of players, coaches and fans applauded as both games were stopped in the 20th minute.

Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the Reds, helping them win the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup, following his arrival from Wolves in 2020.

"I know that you will want to pay your tributes before, during and after the games, and I know that we will hear his song ringing out throughout the evening," said Reds boss Arne Slot in his match programme notes.

"It has been a tough time for everyone connected with the club, but especially for Diogo's family, his wife, his children and friends.

"We cannot imagine the pain that they have been going through, and the club will continue to give them all the support they can going forward. We will always carry him with us in our hearts, in our thoughts, wherever we go.

"Diogo's passing has had a big impact on us all, but what has been so important has been the love and care shown from the football world, and in particular of course the Liverpool FC community."

The Reds play Crystal Palace in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday and open the Premier League season at Anfield against Bournemouth on Friday, 15 August.

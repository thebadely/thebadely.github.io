Foden stars in Man City win over Leeds United

A move to force teams to temporarily remove an outfield player if a goalkeeper goes down injured is being discussed by football's lawmakers in an effort to combat sides using a loophole to create a "tactical timeout".

Leeds United manager Daniel Farke accused Manchester City's Gianluigi Donnarumma of feigning injury to "bend the rules" on Saturday so coach Pep Guardiola could get new instructions to his side. 

City, who won the match 3-2, were leading 2-1 at the time but Leeds were in the ascendancy. Leeds believe City were the latest to use an increasingly common tactic to get messages on to the pitch when under pressure. 

Outfield players used to go down injured to create this timeout but, in an attempt to combat this, from the start of the 2023/24 season they were ordered to stay off the field for 30 seconds.

The tactic has since switched to the goalkeeper, as they cannot be forced to leave the pitch after treatment. 

At a meeting of the International Football Association Board's Football and Technical Advisory Panels in October, various measures to improve the flow of play and minimise interruptions were discussed.

The tactic of using a supposed goalkeeper injury so the coach can speak to players was talked about at length. 

There was support for the idea that if a goalkeeper has treatment the team must nominate another player to go off for 30 seconds in their place, making it consistent with the regulation for other players.

There was an acceptance that often goalkeepers can genuinely be injured. 

Another idea discussed is for players to be banned from going to the touchline during a stoppage. 

Pep Guardiola's team were struggling to cope with Leeds United but the stoppage to allow Gianluigi Donnarumma to get treatment gave the coach the chance to talk to his players

The matter will be up for further debate at Ifab's annual business meeting on 20 January, and replacing an outfield player is getting increasing support. 

Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy suggested that lawmakers could act to close the loophole in this exact way.

"I think they can change it really quickly," Murphy said.

"If a keeper goes down injured, instead of him having to go off, one of the outfield players should go off then it's fair all round. It's a little change that makes a world of difference."

Just before the hour mark, Donnarumma went down to receive treatment, allowing Guardiola to call his players to the touchline and issue fresh instructions during the two minutes play was stopped.

"Everyone knows why he went down," Farke said.

"It is not the elephant in the room. Why he went down it was obvious. It is within the rules. It is smart. If I like it? If it's within the sense of fair play? If it should be like this I will keep to myself. It is up to the authorities to find a solution.

"I ask the fourth official at this point if you want to do something. Our hands are tied.

"If we don't educate our players in football what to do in terms of fair play and sportsmanship and whatever and if we just try to bend the rules and even do a fake injury in order to do an additional team talk, it is not what I like personally. But if it is within the rules I can't complain.

"It is for the authorities to find a solution. Is it in the sense of the game or fair play? I would have my doubts."

Earlier this year, Bolton Wanderers manager Steven Schumacher openly admitted it was being used at all levels of the game.

"It's a ploy, a tactic that kills the momentum of the game when the opposition is on top and if you time it right you can really affect the game and there's a chance to get your team in," Schumacher said.

"It happens pretty much in every game now, even in the Champions League. I was laughing last week watching one of the Champions League games and thinking 'we'll it's not just in England then,' so it's just part of the game now."

According to football's lawmakers Ifab, a player who is assessed and/or receives treatment on the pitch must then leave the pitch, except when:

The injured player is a goalkeeper

A goalkeeper and an outfield player collide with each other and need attention

Players from the same team collide and need attention

A player is injured by a foul for which the offender is shown a yellow or red card

A penalty has been awarded and the injured player will take the kick

According to new developments, A drum salesman said he is "heartbroken and devastated" by the closure of a city music shop. 

Professional Music Technology (PMT) went into administration in June. It first opened it's Norfolk store in Anglia Square, Norwich, in 2008, before moving to Botolph Street in 2012.

Administrators Interpath said rising costs, dwindling margins, and the cost of living had led to "challenges too difficult to overcome" in keeping it open.

Dan Moss, who worked as the store's percussion expert, said that the music store industry was "definitely and gradually dying."

Mr Moss first heard the news on the day the store went into administration. 

"It was pretty heavy, it completely came out of the blue. We had no idea it was going to happen," he said. 

He added that the closure created a "void" for musicians in the county. 

"Youngsters would come in and get inspired. The whole community could come in and see instruments in person," he said.

"It's going to have a massive impact on Norfolk."

Norwich-based sound engineer and tour manager, Dylan Barber, said music stores like PMT were "paramount" in helping him get into the music industry. 

The 24-year-old bought his first guitar from the store and said he was worried about the impact music shop closures will have on the music industry.

"There's nothing quite like the physical element of picking up an instrument and feeling connected to it," he said.

"The fact that there's less of that available presents as a bit of a stark warning that we need to do something if we want to keep the industry flowing."

Interpath said: "Our immediate priority is to provide support to those employees who have been made redundant."

Mark Hedges of Cookes Band Instruments in St Benedicts St said while his own business was thriving, he was "sorry" to see PMT close. 

"They're all passionate people who love music and want to pass on their knowledge," he said.

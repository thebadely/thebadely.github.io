Here’s what you need to know: A couple who saved the lives of four children and two adults have been praised for their "heroic bravery" after a boat exploded on the River Thames. 

Josh Hobbs, 35, and Hannah Lloyd-Hobbs, 34, from Rhayader, Powys, leapt into the water to save six people after the boat burst into flames. 

The couple were walking along the Thames with their dog near Lechlade while on holiday on the Wiltshire-Oxfordshire border on Saturday 31 May when the incident took place. 

Det Supt Joe Garrity, of Wiltshire Police, said it was a "miracle" there were no fatalities, adding much of that was down to the response of the couple. 

Mr Hobbs said the couple were less than 10 minutes into their walk when they heard an "almighty bang – the kind where the air pressure around your head goes".

The couple said they looked round and instantly heard screaming on the boat. 

Mr Hobbs said those on the boat were shouting that they could not swim but the pair reassured them to jump in the river.

"I think my voice tone changed and people ended up in the water. One of them was an 18-month-old – Hannah instantly dived in to grab the baby. I had my foot on the dog's lead and was screaming for the others to get off the boat," he said. 

Ms Lloyd-Hobbs rescued the baby and returned to the river bank, while Mr Hobbs entered the water and grabbed the two young children, taking them to the bank.

"There was a three-year-old being held up by a family member. He was in desperation as he couldn't swim and was trying to keep the child above the water," he said. 

"This lady had been underwater for quite some time, and I think she was in a worse place in terms of her condition so I grabbed her. At the same time I think her husband, in panic, also jumped on me as well."

Mr Hobbs, who managed to get the three-year-old to safety, said at one point his partner looked back and there were four people hanging off him. 

The explosion was heard for miles around bringing other members of the public to the scene. 

They helped Mr Hobbs get the rest of the party out of the water and stepped in to administer first aid, relaxing only when the air ambulance crews arrived.

Wiltshire Police said five adults and four children aged from 18 months to seven years old ended up in the water. 

Nine people were taken to hospital where three remain in a stable condition. Two people, including the 18-month-old child, suffered potentially life-changing injuries.

Det Supt Garrity said it was a "miracle that there were no fatalities".

"Much of that must be put down to the response of two holidaymakers from Wales who happened to be passing.

"With no thought for their own safety they jumped into the Thames to help save the lives of those involved – some of whom couldn't swim," he said.

According to new developments, Who will be on the move before deadline day?

Premier League clubs have already spent more than Â£2bn this summer but there are more deals to be done before the window shuts on Monday, 1 September.

BBC Sport looks at the business each club needs - or wants - to do before the deadline passes.

Bournemouth have been quietly getting on with the job of rebuilding after losing three of their first-choice defence last season with Milos Kerkez going to Liverpool, Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Illia Zabarnyi to Paris St-Germain.

And despite bringing in new faces, coach Andoni Iraola is still looking for more strength in defence and attack before the transfer window closes.

Adrien Truffert from Rennes looks a smart addition at left-back and Bafode Diakite has joined from Lille, but they still need an additional defender.

Ben Gannon-Doak from Liverpool offers real potential, and Amine Adli from Bayer Leverkusen is another addition in the wide positions after Dango Ouattara left for Brentford, but Bournemouth may look to add competition for striker Evanilson, particularly someone with aerial strength.

Arsenal addressed their need for a number nine with Viktor Gyokeres

Arsenal's main business looked to have been concluded with the additions of Martin Zubimendi in midfield and â finally â a recognised striker in Viktor Gyokeres, but the landscape changed dramatically with the knee injury to forward Kai Havertz, prompting the move for Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze.

There had been suggestions Arsenal would have moved for a left-sided player with speculation around the future of Gabriel Martinelli, but it looked all quiet until Havertz's injury.

If the Eze deal goes ahead, which looks certain, then any further activity is likely to be restricted to sales.

Unai Emery's summer business has been restricted by ensuring they stay within financial regulations, and it was with a heavy heart that talented local product Jacob Ramsey was sold to Newcastle United.

Emery still needs reinforcements in attack, hence talk of an interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson, while recruits could arrive in midfield. Whether Villa would meet the suggested Â£60m price tag for the striker is another matter.

Marco Asensio made an impact on loan at Villa from Paris St-Germain last season, and even though he returned to France, there may be a resurrection of a deal before the deadline.

Brighton are another club who did business early in the market as they prepared to sell Joao Pedro to Chelsea. Teenage Greek striker Charalampos Kostoulas arrived, along with defenders Olivier Boscagli and Diego Coppola.

Brighton, however, are always across late opportunities so do not rule out deals â more out than in.

Much depends on the fitness of Danny Welbeck and Georginio Rutter in attack. Any problems there would place a heavy load on Kostoulas, so Fabian Hurzeler may look at his attack with Evan Ferguson out on loan at Roma and Joao Pedro gone.

Yoane Wissa's so-far unfulfilled desire to join Newcastle United is complicating matters for Brentford, although they have brought in Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth as they also look to compensate for the loss of Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United.

If Wissa gets his wish, which is not yet guaranteed, the Bees will surely need to move on a replacement for such a key player.

Aaron Hickey's brief return at Nottingham Forest after almost two years out with injury was great news, but Brentford may still look to strengthen at full-back.

Jordan Henderson adds experience in midfield, while Antoni Milambo gives energy, but with the influential Christian Norgaard now at Arsenal, Brentford may feel the need to add more creativity before the window shuts.

What we do know is that Brentford will do their business shrewdly.

Burnley have secured 13 permanent transfers this summer in a bid to survive in the Premier League, with sources suggesting that will be that unless a deal appears that they cannot resist.

Key defender Maxime Esteve has been the subject of interest, so if any late offers come in manager Scott Parker is likely to seek out a replacement.

The Clarets have also been dealt a blow in that area after Jordan Beyer, suffered a setback following 19 months out with a knee injury, so Parker will be weighing up that option carefully.

Chelsea hold an interest in RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons

History tells us anything could happen with Chelsea before the deadline, but it looks like Enzo Maresca is intent on strengthening the forward positions, with Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Dutch player Xavi Simons well-known targets.

Much will depend on outgoings, with striker Nicolas Jackson one potential departure, along with another forward Christopher Nkunku, and academy winger Tyrique George.

Chelsea will also look to trim their so-called "Bomb Squad" - including Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell - before deadline.

Maresca would also like to strengthen in defence after Levi Colwill was ruled out for most of the season with a serious knee injury, but he has given the impression he had been told to look internally to solve that problem.

Things have been quiet at Selhurst Park so far, but expect it to heat up in the next period as manager Oliver Glasner sets his sights on a defender and a forward.

This all centres around the futures of captain and defensive lynchpin Marc Guehi and forward Eberechi Eze.

Liverpool are hopeful of luring Guehi, who has only one year left on his contract, to Anfield, while Eze now looks on his way to Arsenal after they hijacked his move to Tottenham.

These would leave big boots to fill.

Palace have been linked with Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet, while Leicester City playmaker Bilal El Khannouss is a transfer target.

Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis has also been touted but the Belgian club have every chance of progressing in the Champions League and want to keep their best players.

There are busy days ahead for Palace before the window shuts.

David Moyes has been left frustrated by Everton's lack of signings

Where to start? David Moyes has expressed his frustration at the lack of signings this summer and his mood would not have been helped by an awful display in the defeat at Leeds United.

Moyes has prioritised a right-sided attacker all summer. Negotiations for Southampton's talented teenager Tyler Dibling are dragging on, while a move for Lyon's Malick Fofana was placed on ice as he weighs up his options.

Leicester City's Abdul Fatawu is another of interest, but Moyes simply has to get a deal over the line in that position to inject pace and creation.

Everton will also look at right-back - where they thought they had Fulham's Kenny Tete only for him to decide to stay at Craven Cottage â and Leicester City's James Justin is of interest, although Leeds United also want the talented defender.

Norwich City's Kellen Fisher has also caught the eye. A defensive midfielder will also be on the agenda to give help to 36-year-old Idrissa Gueye.

A fairly full "in tray" for Moyes.

It has been very quiet at Craven Cottage this summer but all the indications are there will be movement before the close of the window, with wide positions the area manager Marco Silva will be focusing on.

Silva will certainly hope for incomings after expressing concern about Fulham's "passive" window and insisting he wants to strengthen in three or four positions. He wants better attacking options.

Fulham have been in negotiations for Shakhtar Donetsk's 22-year-old Brazilian winger Kevin, along with Arsenal's Reiss Nelson - could there even be a wildcard to come?

Raheem Sterling will need to get his career going again somewhere after he failed to make an impact at Arsenal.

Fulham need a winger. Sterling is available, looking for a club and keen to stay in London. Chelsea want him out.

Is that deal out of the question? Just a thought.

It has been a busy summer for Leeds United but there is still time for more and manager Daniel Farke is expected to try to beef up the final third of his team and also at full-back.

Leicester City's James Justin is a target at right-back while a deal to bring in AC Milan's Swiss forward Noah Okafor is imminent.

Leeds will hope the injury to captain Ethan Ampadu, sustained against Everton, will not prove serious and with both Lukas Nmecha and Dominic Calvert-Lewin having mixed injury records Farke may still feel he needs another number nine - although it could constitute selling to do another deal.

Hugo Ekitike marked his first Premier League start with a goal and assist

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has been backed with huge funds this summer to sign Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, Hugo Ekitike and teenage Italian defender Giovanni Leoni.

He has clawed plenty back through sales but expect Liverpool to try to be active again before the window closes, with central defence a priority after the departure of Jarell Quansah and with cover needed for captain Virgil van Dijk.

Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi is the prime target there, while the ongoing saga of the pursuit of Alexander Isak - with Liverpool having a Â£110m offer rejected - is still clouded in controversy. That one could run on even further.

Liverpool may yet look to add strength on the left side of their attack, but for now a central defender and perhaps another effort to sign Isak top the agenda.

Manchester City did the bulk of their business, aside from signing goalkeeper James Trafford, before the Club World Cup. And sources have told BBC Sport their business is done, unless a deal appears which is too good to turn down.

There has been speculation about a move for Paris St-Germain's exiled keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, but this will surely hinge on outgoings, with Galatasaray interested in long-serving Ederson.

Spurs have shown an interest in Savinho, which City have so far resisted. Should they relent and sell, this may yet open the door to an ambitious move for Real Madrid's Rodrygo, but at present Pep Guardiola seems satisfied with the summer's work.

Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim focused attention on the sharp end of his team by spending Â£200m on a new attack of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.

United, however, clearly have a problem in the goalkeeping position, with Andre Onana falling short and Altay Bayindir showing his frailty with an expensive mistake against Arsenal.

Gianluigi Donnarumma has been linked with United, but is there time to get such a big deal done before the deadline?

Amorim has also looked to central midfield, but interest in Carlos Baleba has been shelved as Brighton insist he will not be leaving them. One for next summer perhaps?

There is still time for a deal, though, and the potential departures of Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, as well as Rasmus Hojlund, could open that particular door a bit further.

Alexander Isak's future has dominated this window for Newcastle

What a summer it has been on Tyneside, with the future of rebel striker Alexander Isak overshadowing all of Eddie Howe's attempts to strengthen.

Newcastle have done good work bringing in Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest to end the search for a right-winger, while Jacob Ramsey's arrival from Aston Villa strengthens midfield. Malick Thiaw's signing from AC Milan does the same in defence.

It's all about a striker, though, in the closing days of the window, with Newcastle needing reinforcements even before the Isak saga after Callum Wilson's departure.

Yoane Wissa is the prime target but Brentford are holding firm in the face of his obvious desire to join Newcastle, having rejected an improved bid of Â£40m for the 28-year-old on Wednesday.

Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson is a possibility, although a move for PSG's Goncalo Ramos looks complicated and Wolves are unlikely to consider selling Jorgen Strand Larsen having only made his loan move from Celta Vigo permanent in July.

Irrespective of Isak's future, Newcastle will be going all in on signing a striker - or strikers.

Nottingham Forest have spent Â£140m on seven players this summer in readiness for their return to Europe, but it seems certain there will further ventures into the market fuelled by the ambition of owner Evangelos Marinakis.

Forest want more strength in midfield and are close to adding Juventus' former Aston Villa man Douglas Luiz.

Goalkeeper Matz Sels had a fine season but Forest could look to increase competition there, while options are being explored on either side at full-back, with strong links to right-sided defender Jose Angel Carmona from Sevilla.

Sunderland have signed 11 players so far this summer, a strong statement of intent that they have no intention of timidly returning to the Championship - but they are not done yet.

They still want to strengthen in the wide attacking positions and have a strong interest in Leicester City's Abdul Fatawu, as well as in central defence, where they have long pursued Bologna's Colombian defender Jhon Lucumi.

The Black Cats have really gone for it this summer, so expect them to be exploring deals right up to the close of the window.

Tottenham had hoped to bring in Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace

Spurs are guaranteed to keep everyone busy right up to deal sheet time in the transfer window but it is clear they are intent on strengthening new manager Thomas Frank's hand further.

The departure of Son Heung-min and the serious injury to James Maddison has opened up attacking vacancies, but hopes that one of those would be filled by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze now appear to have been dashed by Arsenal's late move.

Spurs, it seems, will be forced to explore alternatives. 

There have been suggestions of an interest in Brentford's Yoane Wissa, who manager Frank knows so well, but all indications so far are that he wants to move to Newcastle United.

Spurs are are also looking at the wide areas, hence the interest in Manchester City's Savinho. This potential deal has stalled for the moment but it would not be a huge surprise if it was revisited before the deadline passes.

Savinho played primarily on the right for City but has a versatility Frank admires. If that does not materialise, Spurs will still explore alternatives and have been linked with Monaco's Â£47.5m-rated French attacking midfielder Maghnes Akliouche, 23.

They may also look to add in the central defensive positions with Radu Dragusin a long-term injury absentee. Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi would be their ideal candidate but he appears to only have eyes for Liverpool.

One simple priority. Midfield.

West Ham have been pursuing midfield reinforcements to add energy and creation all summer - and the search was given added urgency when they lost 3-0 at promoted Sunderland.

Manager Graham Potter needs results and new recruits quickly, with that midfield area a serious source of concern, leading to interest in Southampton's Mateus Fernandes and Barcelona's Marc Casado.

West Ham's alarming lack of pace in that area was brutally exposed at the Stadium of Light.

And at least two midfielders are required, one who can act as a defensive shield in a holding role and another who can give the team greater creativity.

Wolves have stepped up the pace in the transfer market, quite literally in the case of new signing from Hellas Verona, Jackson Tchatchoua, who was named the fastest player in Serie A last season with a top speed of 36.3km/h.

He has fulfilled head coach Vitor Pereira's need for a player who can play right-back or wing back, but the Portuguese is on the hunt for more.

Pereira is likely to focus on an attacking midfield player â Getafe's Christantus Uche is a name doing the rounds - and may take the opportunity to sign a striker to provide support and cover for Jorgen Strand Larsen.

Wolves are sure to be active in the next couple of weeks, with central defence another area Pereira might want to bolster.

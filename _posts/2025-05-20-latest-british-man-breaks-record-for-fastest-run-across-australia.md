It has been recently reported that A British ultra-endurance athlete has broken the world record for running across the width of Australia, after a gruelling 35-day journey.

William Goodge, 31, started the 3,800km (2,361 miles) run from Cottesloe Beach in Perth on 15 April, and finished on Monday afternoon at Australia's iconic Bondi Beach, his father by his side.

Originally from Bedfordshire in England, Goodge ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons - about 100km - every day. 

He started running marathons after his mother, Amanda, died from cancer in 2018, with this journey raising money for cancer charities in the UK, US and Australia.

The previous world record for running across Australia was held by Chris Turnbull, who managed the feat in 39 days in 2023. The year before, Australian electrician Nedd Brockmann ran the same route in 47 days, raising millions for charity.

Speaking to local media after he crossed the finish line, Goodge said the run was "like a revolving nightmare that wouldn't end". 

"The first nine days were extremely challenging...but you have to tell your body and mind that even though you're struggling, you're going to persevere, and you're going to get through it," he told the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH).

Moments after crossing the finish line, Goodge placed a bunch of flowers on Bondi's famous shoreline in memory of his late mother. 

"She was the most special person in my life," he told the Guardian Australia, adding, "she would be proud of everything I've done - she'd also be concerned". 

Along the way toenails have fallen off, his feet began rotting and he sometimes hallucinated due to broken sleep caused by pain in his bones.

Goodge said thinking about how his mother battled cancer was crucial during his journey, and helped him overlook his own suffering.

"So in the moments where it's tough, I'll think back to those times, I think about the woman she was, and how she handled herself, and how she supported me," he told the SMH.

"I feel like she's there with me a lot of the time."

During the race, he says he saw almost all of Australia's famous animals - though most were dead on the road - and much of its unique countryside.

On Goodge's website about the run, he also thanked Turnbull for sharing his knowledge and experience on how to tackle the journey. 

Goodge also holds the record for the fastest British man to run across the US, crossing from Los Angeles to New York in 55 days.

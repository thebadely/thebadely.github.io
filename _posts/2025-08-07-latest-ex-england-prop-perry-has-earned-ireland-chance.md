Women's Rugby World Cup warm-up: Ireland v Canada

Venue: Affidea Stadium, Belfast Date: Saturday 9 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand says former England prop Ellena Perry has "more than earned" her place in his matchday squad for the team's final World Cup warm-up game.

Perry, who qualifies for Ireland through her maternal grandfather and was eligible to switch nations after last having played for England in November 2020, is set to make her debut off the bench against Canada.

Under World Rugby's regulations, players are allowed to represent a second nation after a three-year stand-down period if they, a parent or a grandparent were born in that second nation.

The 28-year-old Gloucester-Hartpury player's inclusion for Saturday's game follows a try-scoring debut from centre Nancy McGillivray - who was formerly on a transition contract with England - against Scotland last week. 

"She's hit the ground running," Bemand said of Perry, who plays alongside Ireland internationals Neve Jones and Sam Monaghan for the Premiership Women's Rugby champions. 

"So she's more than earned her place in and around the area, in and around the group. 

"She's known to some of the players anyway, so in terms of the fit, there's been quite a seamless transition."

When asked if handing debuts to Perry and McGillivray undermines some of Ireland's longer-serving players, Bemand said: "If done incorrectly.

"But with Christy [Haney] picking up the hamstring niggle we needed to bring in and supplement the front row. 

"So actually, everything has been done well, in my opinion. In terms of the playing group, she's known to a good few of our group. So actually transitioning in, in terms of the block that we've gone through, it's been a pre-season block. 

"So people coming in and getting touch points within pre-season blocks is actually a really healthy point to enter. And it gives people time to acclimatise. 

"It gives people time to understand what the culture is of the group. It's not just an on-pitch piece. There's an off-piece culture where people like to be themselves, and add to our wave. She's been able to do that."

Bemand added that Exeter's McGillivray, who grew up in Hong Kong and has an Irish father, has added an "enormous amount" since coming into the squad. 

"She's played with a good few of the players, other players have got to know her, and it's brought just a little bit of energy when you sort of get through your pre-season bits," he said.

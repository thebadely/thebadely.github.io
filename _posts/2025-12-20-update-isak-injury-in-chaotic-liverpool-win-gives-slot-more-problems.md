Liverpool hold on to beat nine-man Spurs

It was meant to be the moment that finally kick-started the season for Alexander Isak.

Liverpool's Â£125m signing had come off the bench and finished wonderfully past Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to give Arne Slot's side the lead.

On the touchline, Slot was ecstatic after seeing Isak combine with Florian Wirtz, who got his first Premier League assist after signing for Â£116m in the summer.

With Mohamed Salah in Morocco on Africa Cup of Nations duty and Cody Gakpo out with injury, here was a glimpse of Liverpool's future. And the first sign of a connection between Liverpool's two record signings.

Yet within seconds, that joy turned to concern as Isak lay on the floor in agony after Micky van de Ven's tackle. As his team-mates gathered around him, it became clear that Isak would be unable to continue.

"We'll have to wait and see," said Slot. "But if a player scores and then gets injured and doesn't try to come back on the pitch, that's usually not a good thing." 

It looks ominous indeed.

For Liverpool, who have seemingly turned a corner and are now unbeaten in six, the problems continue to mount though with Isak and Conor Bradley both facing a spell on the sidelines.

To sum up their misfortune in a nutshell, Bradley was taken off at half-time after a knock for Isak. On the hour mark, Isak came off for Jeremie Frimpong, who was playing his first game since October.

Frimpong then failed to finish the game as he was replaced by Federico Chiesa in the 90th minute, though Slot insisted that the full-back would be fine and that he simply didn't want to take the risk of playing for 30 seconds with 10 men. Either way, two players that Slot subbed on failed to finish the game.

In the end, Hugo Ekitike's goal ensured Liverpool held on to yet another crucial victory but they almost blew it against the nine men of Tottenham, who had both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero sent off.

"A masterclass on how not to manage the final 10 minutes" was the verdict of Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports. Slot himself admitted that it was far from ideal.

"It's unbelievable if you play against nine men that I would not be surprised if for the nine minutes of added time, they had the ball for eight and a half. That is not what you expect and maybe that tells you where we are in this season," Slot told BBC Match of the Day. 

"We need a few more wins to get a bit more comfortable with setbacks. The thing that keeps in your mind is the last 10 minutes, but there was a lot more to like in the first 80 to 90 minutes."

Alexander Isak became just the second player to be subbed on, score and then be subbed off for Liverpool in a Premier League game after Yossi Benayoun in 2009

Liverpool hold on for chaotic win at nine-man Spurs

Slot delighted with 'unbelievable' win against nine-man Tottenham

It was only a fortnight ago when Liverpool threw away a two-goal lead at Leeds in the second half then conceded an injury-time equaliser after they retook the lead. 

Here in London, they just about survived as Spurs threw the kitchen sink at the visitors, with the introduction of Richarlison in particular making a difference.

It would not be an understatement to say that during the latter stages, it was Liverpool who looked like they had two fewer players on the pitch. 

A far cry from the control they showed during the majority of last season.

"We didn't keep the ball when we had the ball. We kicked it away, they got a few free-kicks, a few throw-ins, corners. It became very chaotic and hectic," added Slot.

Chaotic and hectic has very much been the way for Liverpool this season but the title holders can take some satisfaction from the fact that after a torrid run of nine defeats in 12, they will go into Christmas level with Chelsea, who are 4th.

"Overall, we had good control over the game," Slot said. 

"Six games unbeaten, four wins and two draws. We are definitely not perfect yet but both of our number nines scored. Again, positives to take from the game."

Positives to take no doubt as Liverpool made it three wins in three but this was a day that once again showed that this side currently has far more questions than answers.

And right now, the biggest question of them all is how long Isak will be out for?

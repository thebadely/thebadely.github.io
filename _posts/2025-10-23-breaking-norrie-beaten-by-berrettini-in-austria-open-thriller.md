According to new developments, Cameron Norrie reached a career-high of world number eight in 2022

British number two Cameron Norrie was knocked out of the Austria Open by Italy's Matteo Berrettini in a dramatic last-16 match. 

The world number 59 overcame Norrie in three hours and 16 minutes with a 7-6 (8-6) 6-7 (9-11) 6-4 victory in Vienna.

Norrie let a 4-1 lead slip in the first set, and was punished in the tie-break as Berretini edged ahead. 

The second set was even tighter, with both players keeping serve throughout.

The Italian squandered a match point in the tie-break, with Norrie taking his fourth set-point opportunity to level the match. 

But the 30-year-old could not build on his momentum in the deciding set and Berrettini sealed a crucial break in the ninth game to swing the match in his favour. 

Berrettini, 29, will face third seed and world number seven Alex de Minaur in the next round following the Australian's 6-4 6-4 victory over Filip Misolic. 

Italian world number two Jannik Sinner defeated compatriot Flavio Cobolli 6-2 7-6 (7-4).

Germany's world number three Alexander Zverev also progressed, winning 6-4 6-4 against Italy's Matteo Arnaldi.

But, four days after ending his 882-day wait to win a title, Russian Daniil Medvedev was beaten 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 by Frenchman Corentin Moutet - his opponent in Sunday's Almaty Open final.

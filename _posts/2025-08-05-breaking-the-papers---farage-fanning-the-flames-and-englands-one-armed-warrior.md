Let's dive into the details: The Sun reports that Jay Blades, former presenter of the BBC's Repair Shop programme, has been charged with two counts of rape. He fronted the programme for seven years before stepping back last year.

The Times says there is a "growing row" after Reform UK leader Nigel Farage accused Warwickshire Police of a "cover-up" over the identity of two men involved in a child rape case, because the force did not confirm their immigration status. It reports that the issue has put the prime minister and the police "at odds" and says Sir Keir Starmer has put pressure on police chiefs to release more information about offenders charged with crimes such as rape and sexual assault. The paper says Number Ten has asked that all authorities be "as transparent as possible".

The story is also the lead for the Daily Mirror, but it quotes Labour MP Mike Tapp as saying that Farage is "fanning the flames of hate" with his comments, and is a "fake patriot".

The Guardian says the Metropolitan police is warning that there could be mass detentions if a rally in support of the banned group Palestine Action goes ahead at the weekend.  The paper also reports that 300 left-leaning Jewish figures, including the director Mike Leigh and poet Michael Rosen, have written a letter to the prime minister in which they say the ban on the group is "illegitimate" and "unethical".

According to the Daily Telegraph, many parents with children at Britain's top private schools have managed to avoid Labour's new 20% VAT on fees by paying them in advance. The paper says its own analysis has shown the most expensive schools received hundreds of millions of pounds upfront last year, before the tax was introduced. The Treasury said the use of prepayment schemes had been factored into forecasts for how much money would be raised by the tax.

Many of the front pages carry a photo of the England cricketer Chris Woakes, who was forced to bat with his arm in a sling yesterday after dislocating his left shoulder. England lost the final test to India, leaving  the series drawn. "Pain in vain for England's one-armed warrior", was how the Telegraph summed it up.

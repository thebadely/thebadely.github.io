Winter Olympic Federations against summer sports proposal

Proposals to include summer sports in the Winter Olympics would "dilute" the Games, according to the body which represents existing disciplines.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has established working groups to review the aspects of both the summer and winter Games as part of its 'Fit For The Future', external consultation under new president Kirsty Coventry.

World Athletics chief Lord Coe previously indicated cross-country running and cyclo-cross could be added to the programme for the Winter Olympics.

However, Winter Olympic Federations secretary general Colin Grahamslaw told BBC Sport there are reservations about introducing sports which are "visually" summer sports.

"We think the Winter Games has a really good strong visual identity of snow and ice. And we think that is unique and is worth preserving," Grahamslaw said.

"I think the concerns are, by bringing in some summer sports that maybe happen in the winter but not on snow and ice, you dilute that brand. 

"You dilute that identity. And it's not visually very different from what you can see at the summer Games."

BBC Sport has approached the IOC for comment.

The Olympics Charter currently states that "only those sports which are practised on snow or ice are considered as winter sports".

In 2023, the IOC said research showed only 10 countries will be able to host snow sports by 2040 because of the impact of climate change, and accepted "a need to adapt the Olympic Winter Games".

Grahamslaw, who is also secretary of the World Curling Federation, said if there was a desire from the IOC to increase the number of sports in the Winter Olympics then the Winter Olympic Federations should be consulted.

The Winter Olympic Federations collectively represents the governing bodies of biathlon, bobsleigh and skeleton, ice hockey, luge, skating, ski and snowboard and curling.

"If there's capacity within the Winter games for more sports, more action, more dynamics, then we can provide that from within the snow and ice community," the Briton added.

"You're going to see ski mountaineering for the first time in Milan Cortina 2026, as part of the Winter Olympic Games. That's a new dynamic sport that I think people can get behind and enjoy. 

"If you look at ice hockey, they have a shortened version of three on three."

The Winter Olympic Federations said in a statement earlier this week it was "fully committed" to "innovation, universality, and strengthening the special and clearly differentiated appeal" of the Olympic Winter Games.

However, they said the Games are "not better served by piecemeal proposals" such as the inclusion of summer disciplines.

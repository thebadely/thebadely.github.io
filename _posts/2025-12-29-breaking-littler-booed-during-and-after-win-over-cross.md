Let's dive into the details: Luke Littler has reached the final in his two previous PDC World Championships

Defending champion Luke Littler thanked a booing crowd for "paying for my prize money" as he battled past previous winner Rob Cross to reach the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championship.

Littler won 4-2 and averaged 106.58 - the third-highest at this year's tournament - but it was an uncomfortable evening for the 18-year-old. 

The Alexandra Palace crowd were more on the side of Cross, who won the event in 2018, in the hope of a spectacle and match for the ages.

Littler, who was a beaten finalist on debut two years ago, was agitated throughout the game and visibly raised his level to devastating effect in set three after Cross levelled at 1-1. 

He averaged a stunning 125.25 in that set, taking out three of four checkouts, as he regained the lead with 13, 11 and 12-dart legs. 

The world number one also claimed the fourth set to be in control before Cross extended the match by taking the fifth set, including a brilliant bullseye finish to take out 126. 

Cross, who entered this tournament as 17th seed and whose level has dropped recently, broke Littler in the third leg of the sixth set, but was immediately broken back as Littler found another level to average 117 and claim victory.

"I'm not bothered [by the booing]. Really not bothered. You guys pay for tickets and you pay for my prize so thanks for booing me," Littler told Sky Sports. 

"No-one wanted me to win but I proved them wrong yet again.

"It's not in reach just yet. You've got to get to the final. I'll enjoy two days off then I'll be back on New Year's Day. I spend New Year's Eve and New Year's Day in London so we'll be doing that again."

Littler will face 25th seed Luke Woodhouse or Poland's Krzysztof Ratajski in the last eight on New Year's Day. 

Ryan Searle continued his impressive tournament and reached the quarter-finals for the first time with a 4-0 win over Ryan Hurrell.

The 20th seed, who is yet to drop a set in this year's competition and has only dropped 11 legs, and will face fifth seed Jonny Clayton or Swede Andreas Harrysson in the last eight.

Nathan Aspinall's run to the quarter-finals last year was his only time past the third round since 2020

Nathan Aspinall became the latest seed to fall at the PDC World Championship, but 20-year-old Charlie Manby continued his dream run by reaching the last 16. 

Aspinall, who reached the semi-finals in 2019 and 2020, lost 4-3 in a final-set thriller against the Netherlands' Kevin Doets.

The 15th seed won the first and third sets, but was pegged back on both occasions, only to seize control again with a stunning 170 checkout to claim the fifth set.

However, from there, Doets took over, reeling off sixth consecutive legs to seal a sixth straight win over Aspinall and set up a last-16 tie against world number two Luke Humphries on Tuesday. 

Manby, who is playing in the tournament for the first time, overcame Ricky Evans 4-2. 

The bricklayer from Huddersfield struggled on his doubles early on, taking out just four of 30 attempts in the first three sets as he went 2-1 down.

Scoring was never an issue though and his accuracy on the checkouts improved, alongside a drop-off from Evans, as he sealed a place in round four and a minimum Â£60,000 in prize money. 

He will face the Netherlands' Gian van Veen in the next round in what will be his toughest test so far, with the 10th seed having the tournament-high match average of 108.28 in his second-round win. 

After the match, Evans posted on Facebook that he had received death threats as well as hate and fat jokes. 

Another debutant also progressed with Somerset's Justin Hood beating Ryan Meikle 4-1.

He raced into a 3-0 lead before Meikle pulled a set back but Hood sealed his place and said afterwards that he would not have to work in 2026 after also confirming at least Â£60,000 in prize money.

He has climbed to a provisional 63rd in the world rankings already and said post-match he still has aspirations to open a Chinese restaurant one day.

He will face 11th seed Josh Rock in the last 16, after the Northern Irishman overcame Callan Rydz 4-2 in the final third-round tie. 

Rydz was emotional throughout following the death of his grandfather since his previous match.

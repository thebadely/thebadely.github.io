Experts revealed that Prosecutors in Los Angeles have filed murder charges against Nick Reiner over the deaths of his parents, Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.

Nick Reiner is facing two counts of first-degree murder with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders, District Attorney Nathan Hochman said.

He could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if found guilty. He will be brought to court to formally face charges and enter a plea after he is medically cleared by prison officials, Mr Hochman said.

The charges came two days after the couple were found dead in their home in Brentwood, California, with multiple stab wounds.

The charges also include a "special allegation" that Reiner used a knife.

During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Hochman said no decision had been made about whether prosecutors would seek the death penalty.

The suspect, 32, was also accused of using a "dangerous and deadly weapon, that being a knife".

He was expected to appear before a judge later on Tuesday for an arraignment hearing, where he would have been formally charged. The district attorney later said it would be scheduled for a later date.

Rob Reiner directed several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.

Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.

LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told the news conference: "This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city."

"We extend our deepest condolences to everyone affected by this tragedy."

Asked whether the murder weapon was recovered, Mr Hochman said that would be revealed in court.

Officials said autopsies, which have to be completed, would determine the precise cause, manner and times of death.

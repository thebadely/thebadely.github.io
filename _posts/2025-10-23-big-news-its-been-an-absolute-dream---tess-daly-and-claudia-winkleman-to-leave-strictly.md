Here’s what you need to know: Strictly Come Dancing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman are to leave the show.

"We have loved working as a duo and hosting Strictly has been an absolute dream. We were always going to leave together and now feels like the right time," the pair wrote in a joint statement on Instagram.

"We will have the greatest rest of this amazing series and we just want to say an enormous thank you to the BBC and to every single person who works on the show."

The BBC said their final appearance would come on this year's Christmas special show on 25 December. 

Daly has presented since the first series 21 years ago. Winkleman joined in 2014, having hosted Strictly's sister show It Takes Two since 2004. 

"We will cry when we say the last 'keep dancing' but we will continue to say it to each other," said the duo.

"Just possibly in tracksuit bottoms at home while holding some pizza."

Commenting on the announcement, judge Craig Revel Horwood simply said: "It will never be the same."

His fellow judge Motsi Mabuse wrote underneath Winkleman's instagram post: "Going to miss you so much! 

"You're an icon and inspiration. Still in shock, but wishing you love and best wishes."

Former It Takes Two presenter and Strictly contestant Zoe Ball added: "Absolute class act. Bravo ladies. Huge love."

One of the BBC's highest-rated shows, Strictly Come Dancing launched in 2004. It was originally hosted by Daly and Sir Bruce Forsyth, who stepped down in 2014. 

Describing her 21 years on the show, Daly said it was "hard to put into words" what the experience had meant to her. 

"Strictly has been more than just a television programme. It's felt like having a third child, a second family, and a huge part of my life since that very first show. 

"I knew then it was something special, but I could never have imagined the magic it would bring."

She also paid tribute to "the incomparable Sir Bruce Forsyth", saying: "Brucie set the tone for everything that Strictly became: warmth, wit, connection, and pure showbiz magic."

Winkleman, who also hosts Celebrity Traitors, added: "Strictly is a magical, glittery, fake-tanned train and it's been a privilege to be a tiny part of it.

"It has been my everything, the show I will be eternally grateful for. 

"I will never forget Len Goodman trying to teach me what a cucaracha is (I still don't know) and the complete thrill and honour it was to work with Tess on the results show to co-hosting on Saturday nights."

Winkleman and Daly were prime-time Saturday night TV's first female presenting duo. 

Motsi Mabuse's sister Oti, who was a dancer on the show for seven years until 2022, called their departure "devastating".

She thanked them for "all the beautiful memories, for representing female presenters, being iconic, the laughs and years of family you've given all us". 

DJ, broadcaster and former contestant Clara Amfo added: "This is quite surreal. Salute to you both, [it] shouldn't be radical for two women to present prime TV together, you two do it with such genuine joy towards each other. Big respect!"

Presenter Rylan Clarke simply said "adore you both", while presenter and former contestant Angela Scanlon posted on Winkleman's Instagram: "Claud - an absolute legend, effortless, hilarious, quick as a whip and beautifully tender when legs are flailing xx you will be SO MISSED."

Winkleman and Daly also referenced the off-screen friendship they've built up over the last two decades. 

"Tess - I'm so so lucky I got to stand next to you. You're funny, kind, whip smart and a true friend and I love you," Winkleman said. 

Daly added: "To my beloved Claud - what an absolute joy and pleasure it has been sharing this adventure with you. 

"You're one of a kind, and I'll treasure every giggle, every live show, and every backstage moment we've shared. I'm so grateful to have you as my friend for life."

The pair also completed an "agonising" 24-hour danceathon in 2019 for comic Relief, raising more than £1m by dancing non-stop for 24 hours and five minutes.

Speaking about her decision to leave, Winkleman said she had always believed "it's best to leave a party before you're fully ready to go". 

"I know the new hosts will be magnificent, I look forward to watching them take Strictly to new heights."

Daly added: "This isn't a goodbye to glitter, sequins, or Saturday night sparkle (I could never say goodbye to those!). Strictly will forever hold a special place in my heart - but it does feel like the right time to hand over the reins."

Calling Strictly "one of the greatest joys and privileges of my career", she thanked the show's audience, saying: "Your love, loyalty, and unwavering support have meant the world. 

"You've carried us through every series, and that has never, ever been taken for granted. 

"You are the heart of this show, and I feel so lucky to have shared it with you."

Two years ago Winkleman also announced she was leaving her Saturday mid-morning show on BBC Radio 2 in 2024, to spend more time with her daughter, who was getting ready to leave home. 

BBC chief content officer Kate Phillips paid tribute to both presenters, saying: "They've both been such incredible hosts at the very heart of the show, their passion and dedication has gone above and beyond. 

"They've been integral to Strictly's success over the last 20 years, but I understand why they've decided it's time to hang up the glitter ball and get their weekends back."

In a statement released two hours after Daly and Winkleman's announcement, the BBC said it would announce plans for the 2026 series of Strictly "in due course".

Let's dive into the details: Newcastle United are closing in on the signing of Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade

Newcastle United are closing in on the signing of Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade in a move that could have a huge impact on Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak.

The Germany international, 23, is understood to be en route to Tyneside after a deal was struck with the Bundesliga side.

Woltemade, who has also attracted interest from Bayern Munich this summer, will undergo a medical ahead of completing a move to St James' Park.

There is no confirmation of the fee, but a source suggested it would constitute a club record after Newcastle previously spent Â£63m to make Isak the most expensive player in their history three years ago when he arrived from Real Sociedad.

Isak, of course, remains determined to join Liverpool and Woltemade's move could yet give the champions encouragement to return to the table in the final days of the window after having a Â£110m bid rejected last month.

In a statement last week, Newcastle did not foresee the conditions of sale being met for the Swede - namely securing two quality strikers - as well as receiving an offer from Liverpool that actually gave the club a decision to make.

However, the Magpies have since struck a deal for Woltemade, who would be viewed as a centre-forward capable of leading the line right now, as well as a player with immense potential to develop further, which feels like a significant first step.

The move caps a remarkable 12 months for the Bremen-born frontman, who has two caps for his country.

Woltemade was not even a regular starter at first for Stuttgart after joining the club on a free transfer from Werder Bremen last summer. But the 6ft 6in striker went on to score 17 goals in 33 games, including the opener in the German Cup final as he won the first major trophy of his career.

He then lit up the Under-21 Euros last month and finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals as Germany reached the final, where they lost 3-2 to England.

With qualities likened to Jamal Musiala and Lionel Messi, the towering Woltemade was called a "two-metre Messi-Musiala" by Stuttgart captain Atakan Karazor in an interview back in February, external

"He can control the ball, but at the same time he can also dribble like a 1.6 metre dribbler," he said of his club team-mate. "He's a player who is two metres tall but he has technique like Messi."

Newcastle had previously been frustrated in their efforts to sign a striker this summer after Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko and Joao Pedro moved elsewhere.

These setbacks highlighted the challenge they have faced to compete with Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea for top targets, given the superior revenues, wage bills and legacy of these clubs.

Newcastle have also had bids rejected for Wolves forward Jorgen Strand Larsen and Brentford's Yoane Wissa, who were viewed as replacements for Callum Wilson following the ex-England international's departure on a free transfer.

However, staff have continued to work tirelessly in the background to try to make a breakthrough.

Unlike the moves for Ekitike, Sesko and Pedro, the pursuit of Woltemade was crucially kept under wraps by all parties until a deal was concluded.

It represents a huge boost for head coach Eddie Howe who, in Isak's absence, has fielded winger Anthony Gordon up front as the Swede continues to train away from the rest of his team-mates.

A red card in their 3-2 Premier League defeat against Liverpool in midweek will also rule Gordon out for three games, starting with the trip to Leeds United on Saturday.

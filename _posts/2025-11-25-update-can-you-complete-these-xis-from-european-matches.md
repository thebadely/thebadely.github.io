It has been recently reported that The Champions League returns this week with all six Premier League teams in action.

There are repeats of some classic European match-ups too, including Chelsea against Barcelona and Arsenal versus Bayern Munich.

So to mark the occasion, we're testing your knowledge with six different quizzes. Good luck!

Fernando Torres' late goal at the Nou Camp gave Chelsea 3-2 aggregate semi-final aggregate win over Barcelona back in 2011-12.

The Blues, who would beat Bayern Munich on penalties in that season's final, face Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT).

Newcastle's Uefa Cup dream was ended at semi-final stage in 2003-04 when Didier Drogba scored twice in the south of France following the Toon and Marseille's 0-0 first-leg draw in the North East.

Marseille host Newcastle in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT).

Manchester City and Bayer Leverkusen meet at Etihad Stadium on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) for the first time in a competitive fixture.

As we can't give you a line-up to fill, how about guessing which of these players have played for both clubs? 

Arsenal's last victory over Bayern Munich was a 2-0 win in a Champions League group-stage match at Emirates Stadium in 2015. Since then, Bayern Munich have recorded four wins and there's been one draw between the pair.

Arsenal will hope to end that run at home to the German giants on Wednesday (20:00 GMT).

Back in the 2006-07 season Liverpool backed up a 3-0 win on the road with a 1-0 victory at Anfield to cruise past PSV Eindhoven in their Champions League quarter-final.

Liverpool, who were eventually beaten by AC Milan in that season's Champions League final, host PSV again on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). 

Tottenham and Paris St-Germain's only competitive meeting came in August's Super Cup final, which PSG won 4-3 on penalties following a 2-2 draw.

Spurs are away to PSG on Wednesday night (20:00 GMT) for round two.

Let's dive into the details: The Daily Mail says Sir Keir Starmer will be hit with the biggest rebellion of his premiership today, in a vote on the government's welfare bill. 

According to the Guardian, brinkmanship is continuing over the scale of concessions, with Downing Street's plans to see off the rebels thrown into "chaos". 

The Financial Times reports that the revised measures will save half as much money as first planned, but still push 150,000 people into poverty. The paper's editorial says the prime minister's authority has been badly damaged after an extraordinary lapse in party management.

Several papers report that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is planning to announce a cut to the annual tax-free allowance, for cash ISAs. The Daily Telegraph says the move would force millions of people to choose between moving their money into taxable savings accounts or investing in riskier stocks. The Treasury says it is looking at options to get the balance right.

The government is planning to give priority to British doctors, for jobs in the NHS, according to the front page of the Times. An internal document seen by the paper says the health service will commit to hiring no more than one in 10 recruits from overseas. The move is part of a 10-year blueprint for the NHS which is due to be published this week.

The Daily Mirror leads on the Covid inquiry, which heard yesterday that policy failures had caused needless deaths in care homes during the early days of the pandemic. The paper's headline is "Generational Slaughter".

The Daily Telegraph reports that the BBC Director General, Tim Davie, was at Glastonbury on Saturday, when the band Bob Vylan chanted "Death to the IDF". The paper says that after being "personally consulted" about how to respond, he made it clear the performance should not be made available on demand. The Telegraph points out that the chant remained on a live stream for a further five hours. In a statement the BBC said the director general was clear it should not feature on any other Glastonbury coverage. The Express leads on a call from Israel's deputy foreign minister for Tim Davie to either sack those responsible or resign himself.

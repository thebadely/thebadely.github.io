Experts revealed that Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall has married Russell Thomas, almost a decade after they met when she was a guest on a radio show at the BBC, where he worked.

The actress shared an image of them kissing on Instagram, after People reported that they had tied the knot at London's Chelsea Old Town Hall.

People said the ceremony was attended by 12 family members and close friends, reflecting their "preference for intimacy and authenticity".

Liverpool-born Cattrall, who is most famous for playing Samantha Jones in the popular HBO comedy-drama, met Thomas in 2016 when she appeared on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

She recently told the Times: "We've been together almost 10 years now. And we've had a blast. We've just had so much fun."

The newspaper said they met in April 2016 when she appeared on Woman's Hour to read diary entries written during a bout of "crippling insomnia", which had forced her to pull out of a play at London's Royal Court.

She said Thomas has been "erroneously reported" as being a sound engineer.

While she did not expand on his exact role, she said: "He was an actor originally. He's had an incredibly interesting life and really done it on his terms. He's a bit of a rebel, which I love," she said.

Sex and the City ran for six series from 1998 to 2004 and generated two spin-off films. It co-starred Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.

Cattrall won a Golden Globe for her role in 2003, and received three other nominations for the show, along with five primetime Emmy nominations. 

Parker, Nixon and Davis appeared in spin-off series And Just Like That from 2021, while Cattrall just made a brief appearance in the final episode of season two in 2023.

She reportedly did not play a greater part in the spin-off because of a strained relationship with the show and her cast-mates.

Her other acting work includes the BBC's Bafta-nominated series The Witness for the Prosecution in 2016, the 2022 revival of Queer as Folk, 1987 film Mannequin and the original Police Academy film in 1984. 

Her stage work includes Sweet Bird of Youth in 2013 at London's Old Vic and Private Lives on Broadway in 2011.

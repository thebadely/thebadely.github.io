'Serious blow' for England as Atkinson goes off with hamstring injury

England pace bowler Gus Atkinson will have a scan on Saturday to determine the extent of a hamstring injury sustained in the astonishing defeat of Australia in the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne.

Pace bowler Atkinson added to England's injury problems when he left the field on what turned out to be the second and final morning of England's four-wicket win.

The 27-year-old grabbed his left hamstring after the final ball of the fourth over he bowled on Saturday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

England said Atkinson felt some "soreness" and he played no further part as the tourists ended an 18-match winless run in this country.

"It's disappointing to see him go off the field," said captain Ben Stokes, following England's win inside two days.  

"I'm not part of the medical team, so I'll leave that up to them. I'm sure, as always when a player leaves the field, there will be all the scans, then we'll have to wait and see."

The final Test of the series in Sydney begins on Sunday, 4 January (23:30 GMT on 3 January).

England have already lost fast bowlers Mark Wood to a knee injury and Jofra Archer to a side strain on this Ashes tour.

Matthew Fisher was called up as cover for Wood. Fisher and Matthew Potts are the two England seamers yet to feature in the series.

Atkinson struggled in the opening two Tests of the tour, managing only three wickets.

He was left out of the third Test in Adelaide, then recalled for the Boxing Day match in Melbourne as Archer's replacement.

Surrey's Atkinson improved at the MCG, taking two wickets in Australia's first innings, then making 28 with the bat as one of just three England players to reach double figures.

After bowling one over in Australia's second innings at the end of the first day, he returned on Saturday morning and had nightwatchman Scott Boland caught behind.

However, at the end of the fifth over of his spell, he bowled a slower ball to Travis Head and immediately felt for his hamstring.

Atkinson spent two months out of action earlier this year after injuring his right hamstring in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May.

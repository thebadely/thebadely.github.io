Experts revealed that A judge has quashed a private prosecution brought by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) against comedian Reginald D Hunter, saying it was intended to get him "cancelled".

The CAA's prosecution accused the US stand-up comic, 56, of sending offensive messages on three occasions in August and September 2024.

On Tuesday, District Judge Michael Snow quashed a summons for Hunter, ruling that the CAA was seeking to use the criminal justice system for "improper reasons".

"The CAA have demonstrated by the misleading and partial way in which it summarised its application and its wilful, repeated, failure to meet its disclosure obligations, that its true and sole motive in seeking to prosecute Reginald Hunter is to have him cancelled," he wrote.

"I have no doubt that the prosecution is abusive," Judge Snow added at the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

"My view of the conduct of the CAA is consistent with them as an organisation which is not 'playing it straight' but is seeking to use the criminal justice system, in this case for improper reasons."

Hunter, who is known for his appearances on TV shows like Have I Got News For You and 8 Out of 10 Cats, wrote on Instagram "I sure hope I'm employable again!" and thanked his legal team.

He was accused of sending an offensive communication on three occasions to Heidi Bachram on X on 24 August and 10 and 11 September last year.

However, the judge said the CAA's application for a private prosecution had been "wholly inadequate" when it came to disclosing her social media activity towards him.

"It did not reveal the extent of her tweets directed against Reginald Hunter in the period immediately preceding the complaints (her tweets were sent between 15 August and 11 September 2024)," he said.

"The summary misled me into believing that his comments were addressed to her involvement with the Jewish faith as opposed to his response to attempts that were being made to have him 'cancelled'."

The judge added that the CAA had failed to inform him of a compliance investigation by the Charity Commission into the organisation in November 2024.

Hunter's lawyer, Rebecca Chalkley KC, told a hearing on Tuesday: "The CAA are weaponising and using the courts for their own political agenda and not just in this case."

The CAA's prosecutor Donal Lawler told the hearing that the charity had complied with its duty of candour.

In a statement, a CAA spokesperson said: "We are of course deeply disappointed by the District Judge's decision.

"Our mission is, and always has been, to stand up for British Jews and their allies, particularly at a time when levels of antisemitism and antisemitic violence are rising at an alarming rate.

"Our lawyers are examining the ruling and considering our next steps."

Private prosecutions are cases brought to criminal courts without the involvement of the police or CPS.

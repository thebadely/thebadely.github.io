According to new developments, Arthur Ashe Stadium was built in 1997 and the roof was added in 2016

Arthur Ashe Stadium - the US Open's showcase court - is set to be expanded as part of an $800m renovation project at Flushing Meadows, the United States Tennis Association has announced.

The USTA has described the proposed work at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre as the "largest single investment in US Open history".

It includes a plan to increase by about 2,000 the capacity of Arthur Ashe Stadium - which currently holds 23,771, and is the largest tennis arena in the world.

The stadium is set to get a new main entrance, with facilities inside for fans to be modernised.

Further plans include a new player performance centre at Flushing Meadows, with expanded indoor and outdoor warm-up areas for players.

The USTA intends to fund the renovation project itself - with work to be done in phases between tournaments to minimise disruption - and hopes to get it completed by 2027.

Lew Sherr, CEO and executive director of the USTA, said: "This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis - Arthur Ashe Stadium - which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years."

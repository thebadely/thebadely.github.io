It has been recently reported that For Sarah Ferguson and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, this latest drop of Epstein emails will only add to their embarrassment.

Not only will they be reeling from the photo of the former Prince Andrew, appearing to kneel on all fours over a female lying on the ground. But Andrew's ex-wife and daughters are also repeatedly mentioned in the files themselves.

The former Duchess of York - who has faced her own Epstein controversies - is seen praising the late convicted sex offender as the "brother I have always wished for".

There is also more insight into her financial dealings with Epstein, and her requests for money from him.

Her daughters are also dragged into the scandal, including with one extraordinary exchange where an unnamed person mentions Eugenie's "shagging weekend" in an email to Epstein.

The exchanges are all dated after Epstein was convicted in 2008 for prostituting minors.

The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. 

Andrew has consistently and strenuously always denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment. Ferguson's representatives have also been approached.

Here are some of the findings from the latest batch of documents.

Several of the emails underscore the depth of Ferguson's friendship with Epstein.

In one email exchange from 2009, the then-Duchess of York enthusiastically updates Epstein on potential opportunities for her business brands and books that have opened up.

She goes on to write: "In just one week, after your lunch, it seems the energy has lifted.

"I have never been more touched by a friends [sic] kindness than your compliment to me infront of my girls.

"Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for."

The following year, another email from "Sarah" to Epstein is overflowing in affection.

"You are a legend. I really don't have the words to describe, my love, gratitude for your generosity and kindness," she writes.

"Xx I am at your service . Just marry me."

The newly-released emails also suggest Epstein wanted Ferguson to help clear his name.

At the time, Epstein had been accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls between 1999 and 2007. He reached a plea deal to avoid federal sex trafficking charges and instead pleaded guilty to lesser state charges in 2008 and served 13 months in jail.

One of the email exchanges in the files is believed to be from Epstein to three others, including his publicist, in March 2011.

In it, Epstein reportedly says: “I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.”

It adds: "She was DUPED into believing false stories."

The email from Epstein suggests Ferguson could say she was "told horrible things and she reacted".

In reply, Epstein's publicist Mike Sitrick said they have a strategy - to "get newspapers to stop calling you a pedophile and get the truth out", and one of the tactics was "get Fergie to retract".

The following month, a "Sarah" emailed Epstein saying she "did not" and "would not" call him a "P", and that she had acted to "protect my own brand".

In 2009, after the crash of a business venture, Ferguson appears to write to Epstein: "I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today.

"The landlord has threatened to go to the newspapers if I don't pay. Any brainwaves?"

The email exchange where Ferguson requests money started between Epstein and David Stern, a lawyer and former commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the US.  

Stern sent copy and pasted text of an ABC News article dated 2 October 2009 to Epstein titled Duchess of Debt? Closure of Sarah Ferguson's Business.

The article questions whether or not the then-Duchess of York's finances were "in jeopardy." 

"You have a rat," Epstein replies, and copies "ferg" into the chain. 

He suggests the leak could have come from "disgruntled investors... or others that are owed money." He suggested the recipient "be careful how you spin the answers to these things."

"Correct," she replies, and names an investor who she says has "broken a confidentiality agreement". 

"ABC and all this is being handled by my lawyer," she adds. 

It's at this point in the conversation she says she needs the money for rent. The chain of conversation appears to end here.   

Elsewhere, there are lawyers' letters about deals to pay off her creditors and an email from Epstein claiming to have helped her financially for 15 years.

At various points in the emails, both Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are named.

One email from Epstein to a redacted address, sent on 21 March 2010, simply reads "ny?" (sic).

The reply, also from a redacted address says "Not sure yet. Just waiting for Eugenie to come back from a shagging weekend!!"

No further context to the exchange is provided in this file.

Due to the redaction of the email address belonging to the author of the reply, we cannot confirm whether it was written by Sarah Ferguson. 

Princess Eugenie is the youngest daughter of Ferguson and Andrew-Mountbatten Windsor and she is currently 12th in the line of succession to the throne.

The princess met her now husband, Jack Brooksbank, on a skiing trip in Switzerland in 2010.

In another email a few months later, Epstein contacted Ferguson on 1 July 2010 saying he would be in London that week, asking if there was any chance of her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie - then aged 21 and 20 - "saying h=llo" (sic). 

Ferguson replies two days later saying Beatrice is in London with Andrew, and "Eugie is away with cool boyfri=d." (sic). 

Elsewhere, the emails indicate a lunch was held between Ferguson, her daughters and Epstein.

In July 2009, Epstein sent an email to the "ferg" address asking "where are you? .. "

Just under an hour and a half later, a reply comes from a contact listed as "Sarah", who says: "In Miami. What number shall I call you on now" (sic).  

She goes on to say that she stayed at "Phillip Levine house with the girls. I am aiming to get to you for 12:30 for lunch. Does that suit?" 

Epstein then replies offering "a ride," an offer which is declined. 

"I made Phillip give us his car and a back up one for the policeman," she says, and confirms it will be "myself, Beatrice and Eugenie".

The latest emails once again lay bare Jeffrey Epstein's access to the heart of British high society.

Often, it appears Ferguson was the one facilitating that access.

On 8 February 2010, the then-Prince Andrew’s private secretary Amanda Thirsk wrote to Epstein on behalf of Ferguson, to invite him to Andrew's 50th birthday party later that month at St James's Palace in London. 

"It will be suits and cocktail dresses, and you know me, mysterious mischief, so bring your presents, your presence and your humour!"

Epstein is informed he will need to show his passport on arrival at the Palace. 

This file doesn't contain a response from Epstein. A follow-up is sent from the Duke of York's office asking whether Epstein will be attending, but there is no response to this either.

Another email from Epstein to hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin in 2009 claims "fergie said she could organize tea in the buckingham palace apts.. or windsor castle" (sic). 

He goes on to say that Dubin should call her directly.

Despite her loyalty, Epstein seems to have been far from complimentary about Ferguson behind her back on at least one occasion. 

In an email from September 2011, Epstein sends a link to the Daily Mail's coverage of Princess Beatrice's graduation from university. 

"Pic of F from Friday. not the prettiest site...."(sic). 

No response to the email is included in this file.

But set against Ferguson’s gushing praise for Epstein elsewhere in the emails, this can only be seen as deeply humiliating for the former duchess.

As a reminder, being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Many of those identified in other releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.

Representatives of Sarah Ferguson have been approached for comment.

But there can be no doubt that the York brand is now tainted beyond repair.

Mr Mountbatten-Windsor will shortly move out of Royal Lodge. His titles, his honours, all have already been stripped away.

His ex-wife will also have to move home - although it's unclear where she will move to. Multiple charities have already dropped her over her Epstein links, so it's hard to see where she goes after these further damaging revelations.

As for Princesses Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, they have retained their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign.

But these latest emails will once again raise questions over whether they can disentangle themselves from their parents' mess.

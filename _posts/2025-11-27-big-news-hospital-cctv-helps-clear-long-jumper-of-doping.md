Here’s what you need to know: Wang Jianan won gold at the World Championships in Oregon in 2022

China's world champion long jumper Wang Jianan has been cleared of doping after a review of hospital CCTV footage.

Wang, 29, became the first Asian man to win world long jump gold with his 8.36m leap in Oregon in 2022.

He failed an out-of-competition doping test in November 2024, which showed traces of terbutaline - a drug primarily used to treat and prevent breathing problems in patients with asthma.

The China Anti-Doping Agency (Chinada) said the presence of the drug had been caused by passive inhalation while Wang was accompanying a relative to hospital for nebuliser treatment.

Chinada decided Wang bore no fault or negligence for the violation and would not be banned.

The decision was reviewed by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which used hospital security footage and patient records to investigate Wang's movements before his drug test.

The AIU's investigation sought opinion from an independent scientific expert, who concluded "a passive transfer of the substance to the athlete could not be excluded".

The AIU also said there was "nothing suspicious" about the documents and CCTV files shared by Chinada.

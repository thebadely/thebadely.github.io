According to new developments, Watch Rangers v Aberdeen highlights

06/01/26

Rangers have made a "statement" by moving to within three points of Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts - but head coach Danny Rohl says moving above Celtic into second place is "still not what we want".

The Ibrox side eased past Aberdeen 2-0 at Ibrox to record their 10th win in 13 league games since Rohl took charge in October.

Rangers were 13 points adrift of the surprise league leaders at that time and sat sixth in the division, having won just once in eight games.

Since then, though, only Hearts have beaten them in the Premiership, with the Glasgow side's under-the-radar run propelling them into title contention with almost half of the campaign to unfold.

And while Rohl was wary of making grand statements about what his side may or may not do over the next 17 games - starting with a rematch with Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Sunday - he refused to rule out just a second title in 15 years.

"I'm very proud of the group at the moment," the former Sheffield Wednesday boss told BBC Sport Scotland.

"We close the gap to just three points from 13 when I arrived. It's a statement but still not what we want. We're on a journey. It's about the next game on Sunday.

"When I took over two years ago at Sheffield Wednesday, we were 12, 13 points under the line. In the end we survived. In football everything is possible.

"It's about small steps, belief, bringing confidence back and trusting the players. At the moment we're in a good way but have a lot of things to do."

Rangers have earned four points more than any other Premiership team since Danny Rohl took charge

Most noteworthy perhaps is that Rohl has built that run with the same group who were widely condemned during the wretched reign of Russell Martin.

The German spoke about infusing those players with "belief and self confidence" and how they had been "outstanding" in recent weeks.

But Rangers will still strengthen this month, with the head coach suggesting that midfield is a priority area. It seems unfathomable that the German will not want to upholster his defence and attack, too, though.

The success or otherwise of that - and similar manoeuvres at Hearts and Celtic over the next few weeks - will go a long way to deciding the destination of the title. 

"Rohl is very aware where the team is at the moment and where it needs to improve," former Scotland international Michael Stewart said on Sportsound.

"They're not controlling and dominating games as much as he'd want. He's a good manager with a keen eye for what's on the park."

That same description could be applied to Derek McInnes at Hearts and Martin O'Neil, back for a third tour of duty at Celtic.

So with that in mind, which of the three teams is favourite to win the title?

"I think Hearts at this moment in time," said former Celtic striker Chris Sutton on Sky Sports. "But it depends who gets the best of the January transfer window." 

Former Rangers striker Kris Boyd concurred.

"Hearts are still top, three points clear. And Celtic, for 45 minutes, absolutely battered Rangers on Saturday, and you'd expect them to get a lift. 

"Rangers are winning games and deserve a lot of credit for doing that from where they've came from, but I'm not getting carried away.

"Danny Rohl knows there is still a long, long way to go, but Rangers have dragged themselves back into this title race."

Robbie: Rangers are creating some momentum now, I'd argue they're favourites for the title as things stand.

Al: Been said many times but what a job Danny Rohl has done. If you'd have said back in October this Rangers team would be three points off the top, your sanity would quite rightly have been questioned. 

Holly: So very good to see Rangers scoring from corners, it's been years! Focus on set pieces for Rohl paying off.

Peter: Young Connor Barron is turning into something special bags of energy and belief in his style of play future captain if we can hold onto him.

Peggy: Looks like the team which Russell Martin built is coming good at last.

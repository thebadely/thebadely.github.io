Experts revealed that The Financial Times says speculation is growing that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce an income tax increase in the Budget, because she is likely to be hit by a bigger-than-expected downgrade to official productivity forecasts. The paper says there is also a silver lining for Reeves, as economic growth has been better than forecast.

Rumours about another possible announcement in the Budget - a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2m - is the main story for the Daily Mail. It has been told by the head of an estate agency that the possibility of the new tax is hanging like a sword of Damocles over the housing market.

The Daily Mirror highlights a report by the Fairness Foundation calling on the chancellor to increase taxes for the wealthy. The charity says the gap between the richest and poorest in Britain has widened dramatically - the richest 10% of families own just over 50% of total wealth, while the poorest 10% of households have a total net worth of just £15,400 or less.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has told the Guardian that humanity has failed to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and must change course immediately. Speaking ahead of next month's COP30 climate summit in Brazil, he warns leaders that the longer they delay cutting carbon emissions the greater the danger of passing catastrophic "tipping points".

Under the headline "Costmore cottage", the Sun reports that workmen have been seen at Frogmore cottage in Windsor preparing it for Prince Andrew, who is under pressure to move out of the nearby Royal Lodge. The paper says he is willing to move to the cottage and the building work is underway, even though the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spent £2.4m renovating it just six years ago.

On its front page, the Daily Telegraph highlights the trial of a new system for rapid diagnosis of prostate cancer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. The paper says the service will use artificial intelligence to interpret scans within seconds, with those at high risk being sent to a radiologist and having a biopsy on the same day.

And finally the Times says scientists from King's College London have found that appreciating works of art immediately reduces stress levels and can even boost the immune system. The research involved two groups of people - one viewing paintings in a gallery while the other looked at copies of the works in a normal environment. In the first group the levels of the stress hormone cortisol fell by 22%, while in the second they dropped by 8%.

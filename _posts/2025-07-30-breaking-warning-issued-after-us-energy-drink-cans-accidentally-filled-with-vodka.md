According to new developments, US authorities are warning consumers of Celsius energy drinks to check their cans after some were accidently filled with vodka. 

The US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) issued the warning for the Astro Vibe Blue Razz edition of the drink.

The mix-up came about after a packaging supplier mistakenly shipped empty Celsius cans to the vodka seltzer company High Noon, which filled them with alcohol.

High Noon is also recalling some of its Beach Variety packs which came from the same production line. No illnesses or adverse events have been reported for the impacted products, the USFDA added.

The recall affects two production lots, which the USFDA published on its website. The products were shipped to retailers in Florida, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin, between 21 July and 23 July.

The recalled High Noon packs include the retail code UPC 085000040065 along with the following lot codes:

The Celsius cans include the retail code UPC 8 89392 00134 1 along with lot codes:

The lot codes are lasered on the bottom of cans.

"Consumers are advised to dispose of the Celsius Astro Vibe energy drink, Sparkling Blue Razz Edition cans with the impacted lot codes, and not consume the liquid" the USFDA said.

High Noon Beach Variety packs with different lot codes are not affected by the recall and are safe to consume, it added.

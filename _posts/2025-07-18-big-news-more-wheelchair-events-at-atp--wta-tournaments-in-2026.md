Experts revealed that Great Britain's Alfie Hewett said the support for wheelchair tennis at Wimbledon was "incredible"

More professional wheelchair tennis events will take place at ATP and WTA tournaments next year following the approval of a new calendar structure by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).

While the specific events have not yet been confirmed, the ITF said a "significant number" of new ones will take place at ATP and WTA tournaments, creating a calendar including "higher standards" and "elevated prize money".

BBC Sport understands there will be at least seven extra integrated events in 2026.

The four Grand Slams currently have both wheelchair and non-wheelchair events, in addition to six ATP and and WTA tournaments.

Great Britain's Alfie Hewett - a 33-time Grand Slam champion across singles and doubles - said the expansion presents a "great opportunity for players to take their careers to the next level".

World number two Hewett, who was beaten by Tokito Oda in the Wimbledon wheelchair singles final, added: "Now is the time to take the chance to grow our sport even further and make integrated events the norm rather than the exception."

The ITF's president, David Haggerty, said the governing body was "building on the success of the small number of existing integrated events to create a tour that is even more effective in enhancing the careers of professional and aspiring players."

From 2026, the wheelchair tennis tour will be split into three tiers: Premier, International and Development.

The Premier Tier is the highest level, with tournaments to be graded as Grand Slam or Masters events, or 1000, 500 and 250 as per ATP and WTA events.

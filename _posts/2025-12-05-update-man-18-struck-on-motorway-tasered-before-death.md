According to new developments, An 18-year-old who got out of an ambulance on a motorway was Tasered by police before he was hit by a car and died, the police watchdog has said.

Logan Smith, from Weston-super-Mare, died on the M5 in North Somerset late on Sunday evening. 

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said he was being taken to hospital when concerned paramedics stopped the ambulance on the hard shoulder of the northbound carriageway of the M5. 

Police were called when Mr Smith walked onto the carriageway, and the officer was captured on bodycam footage discharging their Taser, causing him to fall to the ground where he was hit by a car. 

Mr Smith was given emergency first aid, but died at the scene. A post-mortem examination has since been carried out ahead of a future inquest.

Investigators at the IOPC are now looking into the actions and decisions made by Avon and Somerset Police prior to Mr Smith's death. 

The watchdog's director Derrick Campbell said his thoughts were with Mr Smith's family and friends, as well as "everyone affected by this shocking and tragic incident".

"We want to reassure everyone that we will independently investigate all the circumstances surrounding this incident, including the use of a Taser," he added, explaining that initial accounts had been taken from the officer and ambulance staff involved.

He said the IOPC met with Mr Smith's family on Tuesday to give their condolences and explain the investigation, including the matter of the Taser being discharged. 

In a statement given after the incident, Avon and Somerset Police Assistant Chief Constable Joanne Hall said: "This incident has had a significant effect on our officers and ambulance crews who are understandably incredibly upset by what happened.

"As well as providing support to the man's family, we are also making sure that the appropriate welfare arrangements are in place for our staff and also for those members of the public who were either directly involved or who witnessed the incident."

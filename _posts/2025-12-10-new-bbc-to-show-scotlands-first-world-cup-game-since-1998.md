Experts revealed that Scotland are in Group C alongside Brazil, Haiti and Morocco

The BBC will broadcast Scotland's first men's World Cup match since 1998, when they take on Haiti on 14 June, as well as their final group match against Brazil.

England's second group match - against Ghana on 23 June - will also be shown on BBC, as well as their knockout fixtures in the last 32, last 16, and semi-final provided they reach those stages.

England's other Group L matches - against Croatia and Panama - and Scotland's meeting with Morocco will be shown on ITV.

If Wales or Northern Ireland qualify via March's play-offs - both are in a section of four competing for one place- their group match against Canada on 12 June will be broadcast on the BBC.

Two group fixtures for the Republic of Ireland will also be shown if they come through the play-offs.

The BBC will have three of the top four picks in the round of 16 and three of the top five picks in the round of 32.

Both broadcasters will show the final.

Defending champions Argentina will have their group meetings with Austria and Jordan shown live on the BBC.

The BBC will also show two group matches apiece for 2022 finalists France, five-time champions Brazil, the Netherlands and Portugal.

"We can't wait to bring you the Fifa Men's World Cup," said director of BBC Sport Alex Kay-Jelski.

"From (hopefully) England knockout games live on BBC1 and iPlayer to Scotland's crunch matches with Haiti and Brazil to glamour games featuring Messi, Mbappe, Ronaldo, Yamal, Salah, Haaland, and more, we will bring you the drama and analysis of the moments that matter.

"And the ones you can't stay up for, we will have you covered the next morning too."

Niall Sloane, ITV director of sport, said: "We are proud to broadcast the FIFA World Cup here at ITV and ensure it stays free-to-air for the UK audience to enjoy all summer."

The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, the first time the tournament will be staged by three different nations.

The opening match will take place on 11 June 2026 in Mexico City, with the final on 19 July in New Jersey.

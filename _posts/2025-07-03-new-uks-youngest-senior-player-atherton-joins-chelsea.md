Let's dive into the details: Christopher Atherton played for Glenavon at 13 years and 329 days old

Glenavon's 16-year-old forward Chris Atherton has left Mourneview Park to join Chelsea.

The Northern Ireland Under-17 international made headlines in September 2022 when he became the youngest senior footballer in the United Kingdom at 13 years and 329 days old.

The teenager, who joined the Glenavon academy at four years old, broke the senior record when he came on as a second-half substitute for the Lurgan Blues during a 6-0 win over Dollingstown in the BetMcLean Cup.

Atherton beat the record set by Jordan Allan, who played for Airdrie aged 14 years and 191 days.

He was a first-team regular for Glenavon throughout the 2024-25 season, scoring his first Irish Premiership goal against Loughgall in March, as Paddy McLaughlin's side finished 10th in the table.

Glenavon announced his exit on X, with a post stating: "Chris Atherton - blue still the colour.

"We can confirm that academy product Chris Atherton has left the club to sign for Chelsea We wish him the best in his career & hope he and his family won't be strangers at MVP."

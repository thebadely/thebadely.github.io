Experts revealed that Satellite imagery shared with BBC Verify has provided a clearer picture of damage inflicted on two of Iran's key nuclear sites as well as other military targets.

Imagery from two different providers shows damage to the Natanz nuclear facility as well as a missile site south of the city of Tabriz - hit in the first round of strikes against Iran on Friday.

Other images show damage to other known missile bases.

Israel is continuing to target numerous sites across Iran, which has prompted retaliatory strikes.

Newly released optical satellite imagery from Maxar shows the clearest picture yet of what happened at key Iranian nuclear sites at Natanz and Isfahan.

At Natanz, we can see damage to the pilot fuel enrichment plant and an electrical substation, according to analysis by the Institute for Space and International Security (ISIS).

This follows on from earlier analysis of radar imagery that first showed the damage.

On Friday the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, told the UN Security Council that "the above-ground part of the pilot fuel enrichment plant, where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% U-235, has been destroyed".

Uranium-235 is essential both for nuclear power stations and also for nuclear weapons.

Verified footage taken shortly after the strikes show several plumes of smoke rising from the site.

Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told BBC Verify that, while inconclusive, the pattern of explosions "would fit with penetrating bombs being used. Probably GBU-31(V)3s or even possibly more specialised penetrating GBU-28s".

These munitions, known as "bunker busters", have been used by Israel in the past to target underground facilities in both Gaza and Lebanon.

However, Mr Grossi said there is "no indication of a physical attack on the underground cascade hall containing part of the pilot fuel enrichment plant and the main fuel enrichment plant".

On Saturday, the IAEA confirmed that four "critical buildings" had been damaged in Isfahan, including the Uranium conversion facility and the fuel plate fabrication plant.

BBC Verify analysis of the latest images from Maxar found visible damage to at least two structures at Isfahan and an apparent scorch mark near the periphery of the site.

The IAEA has said that "no increase in off-site radiation" has been recorded at either Natanz or Isfahan.

Maxar also provided imagery from two other key Iranian nuclear sites which showed no visible evidence of damage, specifically the Arak heavy water reactor or the Fordow enrichment facility.

Iranian media had reported the latter site was targeted, but the IDF have since denied this.

Imagery and analysis captured on Friday by Umbra Space reveals damage to several parts of a missile complex near the city of Tabriz in north-western Iran.

The damaged sites include weapon storage areas, missile shelters and silos, according to the annotated graphic provided by Umbra with analysis by geospatial intelligence consultant Chris Biggers.

In Kermanshah, low resolution imagery from Planet Labs shows what appears to be extensive burn marks to an area near a known missile base, and possible damage to two buildings.

Footage we verified from the same site on Friday showed at least three large plumes of smoke rising from the base.

Maxar also provided imagery showing significant damage to one structure at Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Ghadir ballistic missile base near Tehran,  and considerable damage to the IRGC radar site in Piranshahr in West Azerbaijan Province.

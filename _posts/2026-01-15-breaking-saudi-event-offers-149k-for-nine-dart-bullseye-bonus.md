According to new developments, Luke Littler has hit four televised nine-dart legs in his career so far

The Saudi Arabia Darts Masters is offering a $200,000 (Â£149,400) bonus to players if they produce a special nine-darter at this month's event.

Players will bank $100,000 (Â£74,700) for a nine-darter - which could then be doubled if they hit the bullseye with one extra dart.

The total is the biggest prize pot for a nine-darter in PDC history.

World champion Luke Littler will be joined by Luke Humphries, World Championship runner-up Gian van Veen and three-time World Champion Michael van Gerwen at the World Series of Darts event in Riyadh which starts on 19 January

Gerwyn Price, Stephen Bunting and Nathan Aspinall are all also in the field.

Former World Championship semi-finalist Mark Webster said on ITV 4: "If a player hits a nine-darter they will get $100,000. Not bad, is it?

"Then one single dart at the bullseye, if they can hit that with their next dart, they will receive an extra  $100,000.

"So 10 perfect darts is $200,000. If they did that in the first leg, it would be job done."

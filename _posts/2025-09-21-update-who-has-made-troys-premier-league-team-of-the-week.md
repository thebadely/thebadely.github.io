Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Martin Dubravka (Burnley): He's really coming into his own. If Burnley are to stay up it will be because of him. Made four or five excellent good saves to keep them in the game against Nottingham Forest and help them earn what could be an important point. 

Tyrick Mitchell (Crystal Palace): He was excellent in the win over West Ham, not only his goal - which was a wonderful finish - but also his ability to go up and down the pitch for 90 minutes and never stop, never complain. Arguably one of the best one-on-one defenders in the country. Really impressive. 

Marcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Both of my centre-backs get in because they are from the only teams who kept clean sheets this week. Senesi is developing into a wonderful player, especially when we look at who Bournemouth sold this summer. There was a lot of talk about their defenders who moved on to Real Madrid, PSG and Liverpool for Â£150m-odd combined - and then Senesi who was there last season steps up and is a massively important player for them.

Sven Botman (Newcastle): I was at Newcastle's game against Barcelona and Botman looked frustrated and a bit disenfranchised when he didn't come on. However, to get a start in the next game, play 90 minutes, and get a clean sheet with the amount of injuries he's had was a massive show of character. He's Newcastle's best centre-half, he just struggles to stay fit.

Neco Williams (Nottingham Forest): Yes he scored but I also think under Ange Postecoglou - with a more attacking style and flair - we're going to see another level to his game. He had a couple of shots that Dubravka saved. He could be one to keep an eye on going forward.

Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool): He scored against Everton, Liverpool won and they are five from five. He could be the best holding midfielder in the league right now. I remember speaking to Graeme Souness about 18 months ago and he wasn't sure because nobody normally leaves Bayern Munich if they're that good. Well he'd better be thankful they let Gravenberch go because he is that good for Liverpool. 

Alex Iwobi (Fulham): Great goal and great assist in their win over Brentford. I love Alex's approach to football. You know you're going to get a 7.5 or eight out of 10 every single week - effort and endeavour. His goal was a wonderful finish, on the half-volley through the defender's legs. And the weight of pass on his assist for Harry Wilson's goal was fantastic. If that pass was too hard Wilson would have had to take a touch and the chance was gone. 

Anton Stach (Leeds): He gets in because Leeds have been flying and I've struggled to put anyone else in. He scored a worldie against Wolves which helps. Stach has been impressive since coming in at Leeds. I've watched a couple of their games - high energy, high tempo. He's a very physical, very demanding player. 

Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): I'm going to give him some love. I'm aware Chelsea were down to 10 men early on but this was a must-win game for Manchester United and Captain Fantastic stepped up to score his 100th goal for the club. Where would they be without this man? Relegated. That's the answer. He deserves to be in for the first time this campaign. Hopefully this is a catalyst for United to have a really good go at this season. 

Wilson Isidor (Sunderland): I must admit I didn't know if this kid would be good enough to make it at the next level. I saw him in the Championship last year, he was good - very long and rangy - but he only got 13 goals. I wasn't sure if he had the quality. He's taken to the Premier League like a duck to water. Working hard for his team. His goal against Aston Villa was a great finish.

Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool): He's the only striker I know who has been brought in for a massive amount of money and people think will be sitting on the bench. But he goes from strength to strength, week to week. There is a lot of talk about Alexander Isak and that's normal because he's unbelievable - but this guy just seems to get the job done time and time again. Every time you see him play it feels like he should score. He carries the line well. He's a different option for Liverpool. He's been brilliant. Five straight wins for Liverpool and he's been at the heart of it all.

Daniel Farke (Leeds): Probably the only time I'm going to give it to him. I put him up as one of those managers that might get the sack because of the way it ended last year. I have to say I 100% got it wrong. Wonderful win against Wolves away from home after going a goal down. He's got his Leeds side fighting and trying to stay up.

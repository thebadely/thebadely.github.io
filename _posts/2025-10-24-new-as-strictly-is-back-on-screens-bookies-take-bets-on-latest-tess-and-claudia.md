According to new developments, Strictly stars are gearing up for the contest's annual Icons Week, days after presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman shocked fans by announcing they'll be leaving the show.

In a joint statement on Thursday, the pair said they were "always going to leave together and now feels like the right time".

The duo will step down at the end of the current series, with the Christmas special set to be their last show.

Some have speculated the pair may say more about their departure during Saturday's live show. Earlier this week, Winkleman said: "It's best to leave a party before you're fully ready to go." 

On Friday, Deadline reported that Winkleman is in advanced talks to host her own chat show. The BBC has not commented.

There's also no hint yet from the BBC on who might take over from Winkleman and Daly on Strictly, and it could be several months before replacements are signed up.

Commentators have been speculating about who would be the right fit for the show and whether it should be a well-established presenter or an up-and-coming star.

Producers could perhaps look to bring in a current or former presenter from sister show, Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two.

The show is currently hosted by singer Fleur East, who participated in Strictly Come Dancing in 2022, and professional dancer Janette Manrara.

Broadcaster Rylan Clark also hosted the spin-off for four years and Radio 2 presenter Zoe Ball hosted it for 10 years.

Some bookmakers have named The One Show's Roman Kemp as their favourite for the Strictly job - with Coral cutting their odds.

Actress Hannah Waddingham, Big Brother co-host AJ Odudu, former Strictly winner Stacey Dooley and Celebrity Traitors' breakout star Alan Carr are among the other names being mooted.

Ladbrokes is also offering odds on Holly Willoughby as a surprise frontrunner, with another ITV star, Alison Hammond also on their list.

Whether BBC bosses want to recruit from within the organisation or look to poach stars from rivals remains to be seen.

Caroline Frost, TV editor of the Radio Times, described Daly and Winkleman as "a formidable presenting duo".

Asked if their departure could potentially mean an end to the show, the TV critic told BBC Breakfast there was no need to "throw the baby out with the bath water" and that "a rebrand" was more likely.

"It still draws in millions of viewers," she said of Strictly. "It's only bad compared with those extraordinary, phenomenal ratings earlier in its reign.

"But certainly it will be like other programmes we've seen before, Doctor Who, Match of the Day, MasterChef; they've all had opportunities for a rebrand... so this could be one of those shows."

On Saturday evening's show, the 11 remaining couples will take to the ballroom floor to honour music icons from across the decades, with songs by Beyoncé, Harry Styles and Ariana Grande in the mix.

On Sunday night, Hollywood actress Rachel Zegler will also make a guest appearance, performing Don't Cry For Me Argentina in the results show.

But Neighbours star Stefan Dennis will no longer appear after he withdrew from the contest due to injury.

Tess Daly began presenting Strictly alongside Sir Bruce Forsyth 21 years ago, while Winkleman joined as a main presenter in 2014.

In a joint statement on Thursday, they said: "We have loved working as a duo and hosting Strictly has been an absolute dream."

Daly and Winkleman have fronted the hit BBC show as it has faced a string of controversies in recent years, relating to the behaviour of some of its professional dancers and celebrity guests.

The BBC's chief content officer, Kate Phillips, called it "the end of an era", and described the pair as "incredible hosts".

Away from the Tess and Claudia news, the show goes on - with the couples performing routines to songs from their favourite music heroes on Saturday night.

Icons week was introduced last year, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Strictly. The other special weeks in Strictly are: Movies, Halloween, Blackpool and Musicals.

The judges will also be in costume as different icons, but fans will have to watch to find out exactly who they're dressed as.

They will provide their scores before audiences get to vote and have their say.

Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston topped the leaderboard last week with 36 points and, more importantly, was dubbed a "queen" by head judge Shirley Ballas who awarded her a perfect 10 for her Rumba.

Earlier this week, Dennis - who was partnered with professional Dianne Buswell, issued a statement saying he had torn his calf "so significantly" that he had been forced to pull out of the competition.

When I met the Australian actor backstage ahead of the first live show, he told me his main reason for taking part was so he could take his wife out dancing.

And in his statement, he insisted he would still be able to do that.

"I owe both the Strictly family and Dianne a massive debt of gratitude for giving me the opportunity to fulfil my dream of being able to dance with my wife (when my leg is better)," Dennis said.

Dennis won't be replaced in the contest. The series will continue with the pairs who are already in it, putting this year's series on course for three couples in the final.

On Sunday night, the professional dancers will perform a dance paying tribute to pop star Britney Spears.

US actress and singer Zegler, 24, who starred in Jamie Lloyd's revival of Evita in the West End this summer, will sail into the results show to perform the play’s famous song.

But it's not all fun and games. On Sunday night, the two bottom placed couples will go head-to-head in the dreaded dance-off, with both competing for a place in the annual Halloween spectacular next weekend.

Strictly Come Dancing is broadcast live at 18:25 BST on BBC One and on BBC iPlayer.

According to new developments, Amanda Serrano (right) could not force a stoppage but inflicted the first defeat of Reina Tellez's 15-fight career

Amanda Serrano marked her Puerto Rico homecoming with a hard-earned but dominant points win over Reina Tellez to retain her WBA, WBO and Ring Magazine featherweight titles.

The 37-year-old, fighting in her home country for the first time since 2021, imposed herself on Tellez with sharp combinations and showcased her ring intelligence at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente in San Juan.

The American challenger, who accepted the bout on just 15 days' notice, caused swelling under Serrano's right eye with an overhand left in the fifth. 

Serrano's experience ultimately told, however, as the seven-division world champion controlled the latter stages to earn scores of 98-92, 97-93 and 97-93.

"I'm super thankful and grateful to Reina for coming on short notice and coming to fight," Serrano said. "She's a warrior."

The bout was contested over 10 three-minute rounds - under men's boxing rules - and victory extends Serrano's professional record to 48 wins, with four defeats - three of them against undisputed light-welterweight champion Katie Taylor - and one draw.

"It's been two years since I fought at this weight. I feel the next fights are going to be much better and I'm glad I could give the fans a show," Serrano added. 

In the chief support, combat sports great Holly Holm fell short in her bid to become a four-division boxing champion as she was outpointed by WBA lightweight title-holder Stephanie Han.

The fight was stopped in the seventh round after the ringside doctor deemed Han unable to continue because of a cut to her forehead caused by an accidental clash of heads, with the champion retaining her title by unanimous decision.

Holm, 44, returned to professional boxing in 2025 after a 12-year absence, having spent more than a decade competing in mixed martial arts with the UFC.

Heavy favourite Serrano had promised a ferocious performance but was met by a spirited challenge from the 22-year-old Tellez.

The bout had originally been scheduled as a rematch with Erika Cruz, who withdrew following an atypical finding in a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association test.

Serrano started strongly with sharp body work and accurate left hands from her southpaw stance, before the contest developed into a scrappier affair than expected.

Tellez, who missed the featherweight limit and was therefore ineligible to win the titles - though Serrano's belts would have been vacated had she lost - fought largely on the back foot but grew in confidence through the middle rounds.

Despite being hampered by the damage to her eye, Serrano remained the aggressor, using her experience to manage distance, cut off the ring and protect her vision.

She steadily reasserted control in the closing rounds, increasing the pressure and unloading sustained combinations in the 10th as she searched in vain for a late stoppage.

Promoted by Most Valuable Promotions, founded by Jake Paul, the event paid tribute to Sina Ghami and Latif "Latz" Ayodele, with their names displayed on the ring canvas. 

The two men, close friends of former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, died in a car crash on Monday and were part of the Briton's team during his victory over Paul in December.

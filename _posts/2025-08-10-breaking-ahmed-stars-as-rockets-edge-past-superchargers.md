Ahmed contributes with bat & ball as Rockets beat Superchargers

The Hundred men's competition, Nottingham

Northern Superchargers 124-9 (100 balls): Brook 45 (30), Stoinis 2-0

Trent Rockets 128-5 (96 balls): Banton 37 (25), Wasim 3-19

Trent Rockets won by five wickets

Scorecard. Table

England's Rehan Ahmed produced an all-round performance as Trent Rockets beat Northern Superchargers by five wickets to maintain their unbeaten start in the men's Hundred.

The 20-year-old collected 2-23 as the Superchargers were restricted to 124-9, before scoring 31 (26) as the Rockets completed their chase with four balls to spare. 

The hosts had looked in control of a routine chase with Tom Banton (37) and Joe Root (20) sharing a 57-run opening stand. 

However, they came unstuck against the Superchargers' spinners, Imad Wasim (3-19) removing both openers in quick succession before Adil Rashid had Max Holden caught in the deep for a laborious 8 (11). 

With 41 needed from the final 30 balls, Ahmed and Tom Alsop smacked 31 off 15 for the fourth wicket and while the pair were removed by Rashid and Wasim, respectively, Marcus Stoinis and Adam Hose saw the Rockets safely over the line. 

Earlier, Northern Superchargers slumped to 18-3 inside the powerplay, Akeal Hosein striking twice in three balls to remove openers Dawid Malan and Zak Crawley before Michael Pepper slashed a routine catch to Root.

Dan Lawrence became the fourth member of the Superchargers' top five to depart without reaching double figures when he was bowled by Ahmed.

Captain Harry Brook, who top-scored with 45 (30), and Graham Clark (36 off 22) looked to have dragged their side back into the match with a 56-run fifth-wicket stand but when Stoinis removed Brook and Wasim with consecutive deliveries, their innings faltered.

They slipped from 90-4 to 110-9, with Ahmed, Cook, and Lockie Ferguson, sharing the final three wickets to fall, and needed a four-ball cameo from Mohammad Amir (11) to get beyond 120.

Archer takes two wickets as Brave dominate Phoenix

The Hundred men's competition, Southampton

Birmingham Phoenix 106-7 (100 balls): Clarke 36 (27); Bracewell 3-10

Southern Brave 109-1 (81 balls): Du Plooy 48* (39); Howell 1-17

Southern Brave won by nine wickets

Scorecard. Table

England's Jofra Archer took 2-16 as Southern Brave comfortably beat struggling Birmingham Phoenix by nine wickets in the men's Hundred.

Archer and New Zealand spinner Michael Bracewell, who took 3-10, restricted Phoenix to 106-7, with Joe Clarke's 36 and Ben Duckett's 20 the only contributions of note. 

It was a formidable performance from Brave's bowling attack, led by the pace of Archer and Chris Jordan, as they were in control throughout after winning the toss.

Duckett was caught behind off Jordan, Jacob Bethell was bowled by Bracewell for one before Archer removed Liam Livingstone for 12 and had Clarke caught at mid-off with eight balls remaining to end Phoenix's hopes of posting a competitive total. 

Brave started their chase cautiously, reaching 28-0 after the 25-ball powerplay, but increased their run-rate before James Vince was dismissed for 41 from 30 having added 75 for the first wicket with Leus du Plooy. 

Du Plooy finished unbeaten on 48 from 39 balls with former England opener Jason Roy adding 18 as they cruised to their below-par target with 19 balls to spare. 

Brave join defending champions Oval Invincibles at the top of the table with two wins from two, while Phoenix have lost both of their opening matches. 

Defending champions of the women's competition London Spirit look to continue their winning run as they take on Manchester Originals at Old Trafford, starting at 15:00 BST.

The men's game follows at 18:30 with Originals searching for their first win of the campaign.

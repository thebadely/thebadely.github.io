According to new developments, Josh Kelly (right) has rebuilt his career since defeat by David Avanesyan in 2021

Sunderland fighter Josh Kelly called out Conor Benn after making light work of Flavius Biea at Newcastle Arena.

Kelly, 31, bulldozed Biea in one round of their light-middleweight bout, dropping the Romanian with a left hook.

With just over a minute of the round left, 35-year-old Romanian Biea was slow to rise to beat the referee's count, prompting the official to wave off the contest.

Asked about who he wanted to fight next, Kelly called out domestic rival Benn.

"If it's a big domestic fight, [I want] Benn," Kelly replied.

"If it's not Benn, if he doesn't want to take that fight, then it'll be a big world-title fight.

"In every governing body I'm ranked number four or number three, two in some governing bodies.

"I'm there. I've been knocking on the door for some time. I'm in my prime now. Let me run, let me run."

Benn is still considering his next move after suffering the first defeat of his career by Chris Eubank Jr in April.

The Englishman usually fights at welterweight, but moved up to middleweight to face Eubank.

Kelly improved his record to 17 wins, one loss and one draw, collecting just his ninth stoppage victory.

After a derailing loss to David Avanesyan in 2021, Kelly has rebuilt his career with seven wins in a row.

Kelly returned to action with a knockout after an underwhelming win over Ishmael Davis last September

Biea had just one loss on his record before fighting Kelly, a stoppage defeat in 2017

Kelly collected his ninth stoppage win overall, his second in his past three bouts

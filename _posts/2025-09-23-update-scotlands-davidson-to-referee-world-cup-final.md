According to new developments, Hollie Davidson refereed the World Cup quarter-final between Canada and Australia in September

Saturday's Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada will be refereed by Scotland's Hollie Davidson.

Davidson was also in the middle for the 2021 title decider as New Zealand beat England 34-31 at Eden Park.

She is only the second person to take charge of two World Cup finals after South Africa's Andre Watson officiated the men's finals in 1999 and 2003.

"To do it once was unbelievable, but to be doing it again a second time in what has been the biggest Women's Rugby World Cup is very special," Davidson said. 

"We have seen what this tournament has been able to do in terms of inspiring and engaging. To be a part of that on Saturday will be so special."

Davidson added: "You never know when these games will come around again, so what I've learned across my career is to be very focused but enjoy the moment. That's when I referee my best, is when I'm present.

"I don't take the job lightly and I want to go out and do my job to the best of my ability."

South Africa's Aimee Barrett-Theron and Italy's Clara Munarini will be Davidson's assistant referees, with Ireland's Leo Colgan the television match official and Italy's Matteo Liperini the foul play review officer.

"Rugby World Cups are the pinnacle in our sport and to referee two finals is an outstanding achievement that should not be underestimated," World Rugby women's high-performance referee manager Alhambra Nievas said.

"Hollie is a top referee, a trailblazer and a role model, setting a standard to which the match officials' group aspires to. I hope that all those selected cherish what will be a very special finals day."

Simons scores first Premier League goal as Spurs beat Brentford

Thomas Frank was finally able to stride on to the turf without facing hostility after his most important victory as Tottenham head coach.

The pressure valve has been released by the manner in which Spurs fought back to earn a point at Newcastle United on Tuesday, before securing a fully-deserved win against his former club Brentford.

It was only seven days ago that relations between the Dane and supporters questioning his credentials hit a low when he claimed those who jeered goalkeeper Gugliemo Vicario after his mistake in the defeat against Fulham were not "true Tottenham fans".

Criticising your own support is a hazardous strategy and often ends very badly, which is why this Spurs' win carried more significance for Frank and his players.

This was a banana skin of a fixture, with the danger that the club where Frank was idolised - the one he established in the Premier League - might turn up on his new doorstep to pile on the agony.

Frank may only be 15 league games into his Spurs reign, but serious doubts have been posed about his suitability for the job by a demanding fanbase.

It is premature to suggest the tide has turned for Frank, but it may have at least stopped coming in. This victory will calm nerves.

Frank has, at times, looked like a man struggling to adapt to the size of the Spurs task after working in a lower-profile role at Brentford. But the club's hierarchy are keen to back him, though they are also aware of the disconnect that has existed with supporters.

If Frank averts further crises, Spurs are in a position to provide spending power in the January window, while chief executive Vinai Venkatesham is a renowned cool head, who importantly offered support to Mikel Arteta during his early struggles as Arsenal manager.

It should be remembered that Frank took over a squad that, despite winning the Europa League last season, had finished 17th in the Premier League after losing 22 games out of 38.

As always, however, results dictate events and more specifically Frank's future, so Spurs' response to last Saturday's defeat by Fulham at least offers encouragement.

Thomas Frank is 15 matches into his Tottenham reign

Frank's approach has been condemned as negative by his detractors - one more suited to Brentford than Spurs. That criticism was cranked up in November after the home defeat by Chelsea and the 4-1 loss at Arsenal in the north London derby, but the signs were positive here.

He has been hit over the head with poor expected goals (xG) statistics. So he can point to the fact that against Brentford, Spurs produced their second-highest xG total in a league game this season (2.15), their highest number of shots on target (seven), plus their lowest number of shots faced (four), shots on target (one) and lowest xG against total (0.29).

The statistic that mattered most, though, is the one that always does.

It should have been more than 2-0, but it gave Spurs only their second league win at home this season, and their first since Burnley were beaten on the opening weekend of the season.

On Spurs looking more threatening, Frank said: "I think it's because of a few things. I like the look of the team in general. It's a little bit of everything."

He added: "I think it was a very good performance overall. A quite complete performance. Offensively we looked a big threat going forward. We were much more dynamic and producing good chances and good moments. I really like that.

"Also on the defensive side of things, we kept them to four shots throughout the game. It was a really good performance. The fans were amazing from the off and the players were thriving off them. To have that complete collaboration together, I really loved that. It was a great win.

"We felt we needed a top performance for all of us and if we can do more of this together, then this can be the fortress we dream of. It is one step forward, there are a lot of steps to be there every week consistently but I loved it. I think the fans were very good."

It was also the day when Xavi Simons, who has struggled to make a consistent impact since his Â£51.8m summer move from RB Leipzig, finally showed what all the fuss was about.

Simons' run and cross put Richarlison's opener on a plate after 25 minutes. Then two minutes before the interval, he recovered from losing possession to run from just inside his own half and accelerate away from Brentford's defence, scoring his first goal for Spurs.

The Netherlands forward revelled in his free role, pulling the strings behind a front trio of Mohammed Kudus, Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani.

It was a performance that delighted his manager, who said: "I am really so pleased for him because he has been working so hard on the training pitch and in the gym. 

"He is a 24/7 pro and wants it so badly. I think he has been on a good run and close to being decisive. Today with an assist and a goal, very good."

In 2025, before this win, Spurs had played 16 league games at home, winning only three and losing 10. This is the pattern Frank has to change.

The toxicity of last week had gone in line with the improved performance, with gallows humour returning as one fan responded to the applause at half-time by cupping an ear then asking: "What's that strange noise?"

It will have been music to the ears of Frank â but he will know Spurs must continue the upward curve at home to Slavia Prague in the Champions League on Tuesday.

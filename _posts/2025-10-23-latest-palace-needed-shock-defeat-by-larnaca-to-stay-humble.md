According to new developments, Crystal Palace's first home game in a major European competition didn't go to plan as they were beaten by AEK Larnaca, but manager Oliver Glasner said "maybe the whole environment needed it to stay humble".

Thursday was supposed to be Palace's big night as Selhurst Park hosted a match in Europe for the first time in its 101-year history.

There was an extra buzz at Selhurst station and inside the ground a sell-out crowd was chanting Glasner's name and singing songs about last season's FA Cup win.

Right before kick-off a stunning Dad's Army-inspired tifo plotting out Palace's path from south London to May's Conference League final in Leipzig was unfurled, with a banner underneath saying "we are the boys who will win your little game".

The stadium has become a fortress for Palace, who went into the game against the Cypriots unbeaten at home since February in all competitions.

But the Eagles' play never reflected the hype. Yes they created plenty of chances, 15 in total, but just one was on target.

Jean-Philippe Mateta hit the crossbar with a hooked volley from close range in the first half and substitute Eddie Nketiah should have levelled in a late rally from the hosts, but completely missed a loose ball from five yards out.

Does Glasner have a point?

"You are always told when you play in the Premier League you win the Conference League," said the Palace boss.  

"Stay humble. I don't know if any debutant [is able] to win the competition. I don't think so. 

"We will learn from it, the players will learn. It's disappointing, a frustrating night, but maybe the whole environment needed it to stay humble."

The Palace fans unfurled a tifo at kick-off

Glasner also said the match felt "a little bit deja vu" adding that his team didn't "score when we should and we get punished".

They are winless across their past three games having also lost to Everton in October - a match that ended their club record 19-match unbeaten run - and drawing 3-3 with Bournemouth last weekend.

In each of their past three matches Palace have had spells of dominance over their opponents.

They would have fancied themselves against Larnaca, who had only played an English side twice before, a 6-0 aggregate loss to West Ham in 2023.

The goal came from an error. The Cypriot Cup winners struck in the 51st minute when Eagles defender Jaydee Canvot gave the ball straight to Marcus Rohden who teed up Riad Bajic to find the net with a powerful finish.

Palace captain Marc Guehi told TNT Sports: "They scored, we didn't, it's that simple. 

"Every team comes with a different type of gameplan. Today it was a team that sat back. They did well, they frustrated us.

"It is good opportunity to learn and understand that these European games are tough no matter who you play against."

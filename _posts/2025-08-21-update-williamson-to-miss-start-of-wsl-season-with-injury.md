Experts revealed that Leah Williamson became the first England captain to lift a major European trophy overseas when the Lionesses beat Spain at the Euros this summer

England captain Leah Williamson is set to miss the start of the Women's Super League season because of a knee injury she suffered in the Euro 2025 final.

The 28-year-old Arsenal centre-back missed the Gunners' pre-season training camp in Germany this month after reporting back to the club with swelling in her right knee.

She has had a small clean-up operation, which was a success, and has started her rehabilitation, but she is expected to be out for several weeks.

Arsenal, who won the Champions League last season, begin their WSL campaign against London City Lionesses on 6 September.

Williamson suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in the same knee during a WSL game against Manchester United in April 2023, although her latest injury is not directly linked to that one.

After guiding England to their first European Championship title in 2022, she was then forced to miss the World Cup a year later because of the ACL setback. Williamson spent nearly 10 months on the sidelines before returning to Arsenal and the Lionesses in early 2024.

She played the full 90 minutes plus extra time of the Euros final last month, which ended 1-1 before England beat world champions Spain 3-1 on penalties.

England team-mate Lauren James is also set to miss the start of the season for Chelsea with an ankle injury sustained while winning the Euros.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Alisha Joyce-Butchers (left) married Jasmine Joyce-Butchers in December 2023

Wales flanker Alisha Joyce-Butchers has announced that she is expecting a baby with wife and team-mate Jasmine Joyce-Butchers.

The 27-year-old was a notable absentee in the 2025 Women's Six Nations and has now revealed: "We've been keeping a little secret."

The baby is due in November, meaning Alisha Joyce-Butchers will miss the Rugby World Cup which kicks off in August.

"At the start of this year Jasmine and I started our IVF journey. Today I am so happy to say that I am 12 weeks pregnant, and so excited for what's to come," she wrote on social media, alongside an ultrasound photo.

"We appreciate there has been interest and speculation around my absence from the Wales Six Nations campaign but now you know why," said Alisha Joyce-Butchers.

"We wanted to let all our family, friends and the Wales squad know before we went public and am sure everybody can relate to that.

"The morning sickness has been a new experience, especially while Jaz has been off playing rugby, but we are both delighted with our special news."

Jasmine Joyce-Butchers said: "To say we are excited would be an understatement.

"It hasn't been easy keeping it a secret, but once we got married we always planned on starting a family, and we both know this is a new chapter in our lives and it does put everything - including rugby - into perspective."

Wales trio sign new Bears deals

The couple are both professionally contracted players with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and play their club rugby with Bristol Bears.

They recently signed new two-year deals with the Premiership Women's Rugby club.

Wing Jasmine is also a three-time Olympian with Great Britain Sevens.

The WRU said Alisha Joyce-Butchers will return to the squad in a controlled manner under its new performance maternity policy.

"On behalf of the Wales women's squad, the players, coaches and staff, the WRU and everybody in the Welsh rugby family, we send our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to both Alisha and Jaz," said WRU head of women's rugby Belinda Moore.

"The WRU offers them our full support, and we look forward to welcoming a new Wales supporter to the family."

It has been recently reported that Keely Hodgkinson will be looking to add world gold to her Olympic title in the 800m

Sunday is the ninth and final day of the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

Keely Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell will go head to head in the women's 800m final - can they make it a British one-two in the event?

Morgan Lake will target gold in the women's high jump, while George Mills has a good chance of a medal in the men's 5,000m.

Great Britain's teams in the women's 4x100m and men's 4x400m relays will be looking to secure places on the podium.

Silver - 2:

Jake Wightman, the 2022 world champion, claimed silver in the men's 1500m.

Amy Hunt won women's 200m silver in her first major final.

Bronze - 1: 

Two-time world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson shared the bronze medal position in the heptathlon after finishing on the same number of points as Taliyah Brooks of the United States.

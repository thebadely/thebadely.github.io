Let's dive into the details: Rhys Edwards signed a long-term deal with promoter Boxxer in February 2025

Welshman Rhys Edwards will fight for a British title when he faces Gully Powar on the undercard of Lauren Price's world title defence against Stephanie Aquino on 4 April in Cardiff.

Edwards will challenge for the featherweight title at the Utilita Arena, which will be shown live on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer from 20:00 GMT.

Edwards, 25, says the opportunity is a career culmination for him.

"Winning the British title has been a dream since I first started boxing," he said. 

"I've worked my whole career for this moment, and now it's time to make it count. To get this opportunity at home in Wales is a special feeling."

Edwards has just one defeat on his record, coming against Peter McGrail in 2024, but bounced back with a routine win over Thomas Essomba last June.

Wolverhampton fighter Powar, 23, is still making a name for himself in the division after catching the eye while competing in the WBC Boxing Grand Prix last year.

Powar has 13 wins and one loss in his career.

"This is my time to shine. I've been putting in the work behind the scenes and now everyone gets to see what I'm about," Powar said.

"I respect Rhys, but I'm coming to Cardiff to take that British title home."

Ben Shalom, who promotes Edwards, described the contest as "a fantastic British title fight between two young, hungry fighters".

Shields calls out Price for a blockbuster fight

The Boxxer fight night will be the fourth shown on the BBC, with Francesca Hennessy's win over Ellie Bouttell last Saturday the most recent instalment of the partnership.

Unbeaten unified champion Price will defend her WBA, WBC and IBF welterweight titles against Puerto Rican challenger Pineiro.

A tenth win in a row for Price could set up an undisputed bout with American WBO champion Mikaela Mayer later this year.

But the Olympic champion is also eyeing a fight with Irishwoman Katie Taylor.

"To share a ring with Katie Taylor would be phenomenal," Price told BBC Sport Wales.

"Ireland and Wales, stadium fight - that would be a dream come true really."

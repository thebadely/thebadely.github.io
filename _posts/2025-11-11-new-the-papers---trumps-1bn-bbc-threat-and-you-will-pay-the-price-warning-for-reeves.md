Experts revealed that President Donald Trump's threat of legal action against the BBC features on most of the front pages, including the Sun which describes Panorama's edit of his speech as the "Beeb's Billion Dollar Bungle".

"Trump Tells BBC: Grovel - Or I'll Sue", says the Daily Mail's headline.

The Daily Telegraph says the "extraordinary" move by the US president has "turned the screw" on a corporation that's "reeling" from the resignations of the director general and the head of news.

While the i Paper says the future of the licence fee is now in jeopardy, with the BBC "left weakened" ahead of negotiations with the government.

The Guardian claims a BBC board member with links to the Conservatives "led the charge" in pressuring the corporation's leadership over claims of systemic bias, before Tim Davie and Deborah Turness announced they were stepping down.

Sources have told the paper that Theresa May's former director of communications, Sir Robbie Gibb, "amplified the criticism" in key meetings.  Writing in the Guardian, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says Sir Robbie should be removed from the BBC board before the search begins for a new director general.

Comments to the BBC by the chancellor - signalling she could scrap the two-child benefit cap - are highlighted by the Times. It says Rachel Reeves appeared confident of funding the move - thought to cost more than £3bn - despite Treasury concerns that levies on gambling will not be enough.

The Guardian says Reeves is hoping that removing the cap will placate many Labour MPs who are concerned about the political consequences of raising income tax.

The main news for the Daily Mirror is a new interview by the Prince of Wales - given to a TV channel in Brazil - in which the heir to the throne revealed that he and the Princess of Wales were honest with their children about her cancer diagnosis. 

"Hiding stuff doesn't work. We chose to communicate a lot more", he says.  The paper's leader column applauds the "openness" of the royal couple, noting honesty is the "best policy", allowing love, patience and clarity to steady even the stormiest seas.

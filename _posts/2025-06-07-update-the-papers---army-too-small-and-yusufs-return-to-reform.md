Let's dive into the details: The Sunday Times reports that the White House has warned Downing Street against approving the construction of China's proposed new embassy at a former Royal Mint site in London. The paper says Washington has expressed concern because the location is near communications cables which could be attacked or targeted for espionage. A member of the US House of Representatives' China committee is quoted in the article as saying that even considering the construction of the embassy could be considered a "curious error in judgement in London".

The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has told the Sunday Telegraph that bosses should have the right to ban the burka and other face coverings in the workplace. She also describes sharia courts and marriages between first-cousins as "insidious" and "nonsense sectarianism".

The Observer reports on the extra money that schools in England will receive in this week's spending review. The paper calls the increase "surprisingly generous" and says it will take funding for each pupil in England to its highest ever level.

The Mail on Sunday carries an allegation from an anonymous woman that her son was refused an NHS appointment with occupational health therapists because - she claims - he goes to a fee-paying school in south-west London. The paper claims to have found evidence of similar cases in Norfolk and Somerset. A health service spokesperson has declined to address the claims but apologised if the wording in the correspondence received by the family in London caused upset.

Young people could have their access to social media capped at two hours per app a day, according to the Sunday Mirror. It says ministers are also considering a ban during school hours, and a 10pm curfew. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, tells the paper he wants to deliver a "much healthier life for children online"

The Sunday Express carries warnings from farming groups that Britain's harvest this year is "on a knife edge", because of the driest spring since Victorian times. Crops are showing signs of stress and variable growth, the article says.

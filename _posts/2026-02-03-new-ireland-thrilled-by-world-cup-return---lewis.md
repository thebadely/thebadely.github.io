According to new developments, Ireland won five of seven matches at the T20 World Cup qualifiers in Nepal this month

Ireland captain Gaby Lewis says qualifying for the 2026 T20 World Cup means "so much" to the side after missing out on the tournament two years ago.

Lloyd Tennant's side booked their place at the global qualifiers in Nepal on Sunday thanks to their 62-run win over Thailand. 

"We're all absolutely thrilled. Obviously there were some scars there from not qualifying for the last one," said Lewis

"That was tough for the girls, so there were a lot of nerves coming into the competition, but we felt really prepared. It obviously means so much."

Lewis was named batter of the tournament in Nepal after averaging 39 across Ireland's seven matches with her best knock 73 in a loss to Bangladesh. 

While much of Ireland's T20 successes in recent seasons have been anchored by the batting of the so-called 'Big Three' of Lewis, Orla Prendergast and Amy Hunter, World Cup qualification owed plenty to a bowling attack that limited the Netherlands and Thailand to 45 and 59 runs respectively in their Super Six wins. 

"It was brilliant. You've got some great bowlers in our squad," added Lewis.

"It was brilliant to see different bowlers stand up in different games, it wasn't just the same bowler all through the tournament. It was a brilliant, all-round squad performance."

Lewis scored 276 runs across Ireland's seven games at the qualifiers

While Ireland do not yet know their opponents at the tournament to be staged in England from 12 June, Lewis says it would be "massive" to have the opportunity to play at Lords.

Wherever they play, the 24-year-old believes the proximity of the tournament will be beneficial for both players and fans alike. 

"I think cricket's definitely up and coming in Ireland, and I think the more that we can be seen on the world stage, the better and hopefully young girls will come over and watch.

"We had great support out in Nepal, and no doubt it'll be even more in England. I think it'll probably be the closest we'll get to a home World Cup so we're hugely excited.

"Usually in World Cups and these big tournaments, you have to go to a prep camp and stuff to acclimatise, so obviously it's an advantage for us to be playing in similar conditions to Ireland."

Ireland will use a tri-series with Pakistan and West Indies as preparation for the tournament at the start of what will be a busy summer for Lewis in particular. 

When not on international duty, she will again represent Lancashire as their overseas player in this year's One-Day Cup.

Linking up with the side in April, Lewis will return to Old Trafford after helping the side to last season's title with an unbeaten 141 not out against Hampshire in the final.

"I think looking at the last few years, it's something that I really wanted to get involved in, just playing at higher standards consistently," she said.

"It was just about getting that opportunity, so I was delighted to get the opportunity last September and I was so happy being able to take it.

"I'm delighted for the girls to sign me again and I can't wait for the summer ahead."

According to new developments, Sarah Ferguson's charity, Sarah's Trust, has announced it will close "for the foreseeable future" just days after new details emerged about the former Duchess of York's friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

A spokesman for the foundation said the decision comes after "some months" of discussion. 

Among the more than three million documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) last week were emails appearing to show Ferguson was in contact with Epstein while he was in prison for soliciting sex from a minor.

The BBC has contacted Ferguson for comment on the latest release. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.

The charity Sarah's Trust was established in 2020 and is "dedicated to supporting frontline, grassroots work to address the humanitarian and environmental crisis, the hunger crisis and issues perpetuating cycles of extreme poverty", according to its website.

"Our chair Sarah Ferguson and the board of trustees have agreed that with regret the charity will shortly close for the foreseeable future," a spokesman said on Monday evening.

"This has been under discussion and in train for some months," he added.

The foundation did not provide further details behind its decision to close.

Previous revelations surrounding the former duchess' ties to Epstein led to her being dropped as a patron or ambassador from a series of charities last year.

Julia's House, a children's hospice, was the first to remove her, saying it was "inappropriate" for her to continue in the role.

The Teenage Cancer Trust, Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, Children's Literacy Charity, National Foundation for Retired Service Animals and Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped Ferguson as patron.

The British Heart Foundation said she would no longer be its ambassador.

The latest release of files related to the late Epstein included pictures of Ferguson's ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a female lying on the floor.

Mountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment.

In the latest tranche of files released by the DoJ, the former duchess is seen praising Epstein as the "brother I have always wished for".

In another email, Ferguson appears to congratulate Epstein on the arrival of a "baby boy".

Other emails revolve around Ferguson's business, Mothers Army, where she asks the paedophile financier for advice on how to get it off the ground.

Epstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a "Sarah" says: "I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?"

Then on the 26 June 2009, "Sarah" writes to Epstein saying: "I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you".

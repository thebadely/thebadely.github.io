Let's dive into the details: As a footballer, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas seemed destined for greatness. But a drug-smuggling conviction has left his career and reputation in tatters. How did things unravel so dramatically for a player once tipped for the top?

Hailed by legendary Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as a footballer who could "play anywhere", Emmanuel-Thomas was marked out early on as having elite potential.

Imposing, technically gifted and surprisingly agile, the striker appeared to have the world at his feet.

But a career that promised so much at Arsenal faltered and saw him spend years  flitting between the second and third tiers of English football.

In 2020 he moved to play in Scotland and was still plying his trade north of the border when, on 18 September, he was arrested at his home in Gourock, near Glasgow.

Sixteen days earlier, Border Force officers had stopped two women at London Stansted Airport and found drugs in their cases.

It was not a minor haul; they were staring at cannabis with a street value of £600,000.

How did it get there? The evidence soon led detectives to Emmanuel-Thomas.

Wind back a decade and a half, and things were very different.

It is 26 May 2009, and Arsenal's latest batch of academy talents can barely contain their excitement.

The young prospects, including Jack Wilshere and Francis Coquelin, have just won the FA Youth Cup.

One player in particular has stood out: their 16-year-old captain, Emmanuel-Thomas, who has scored in every round of the competition.

"These young men have a very bright future indeed," remarked one commentator.

But despite going on to make five first-team appearances, it was not quite to be for Emmanuel-Thomas.

He was shipped out on several loans before leaving the north London club for Ipswich Town.

It was a move that excited supporters in Suffolk, who were keen to see what the former Arsenal starlet could produce.

However, 71 games and eight goals later, Emmanuel-Thomas had not quite made the mark fans hoped for, and he moved to Bristol City in a player exchange deal.

Here, he helped the Robins secure promotion to the Championship and became something of a cult hero, scoring 21 goals in his first season.

A move to Queens Park Rangers followed, with subsequent loan spells at MK Dons and Gillingham.

But in 2019, Emmanuel-Thomas accepted a transfer to a Thai-based team that would alter the course of his life.

It is believed he was tempted into the country's drugs underworld while playing for PTT Rayong, a club that folded in the same year.

Despite later moves to an Indian side and several Scottish outfits, including Aberdeen, Emmanuel-Thomas never shook off the criminal connections he made.

By the time he took a six-month contract at Greenock Morton, a 40-minute drive from Glasgow, the game was almost up.

As he lined up for them against Queens Park on 14 September, he would have surely known the law was about to catch up with him.

The women arrested at Stansted were his 33-year-old girlfriend, Yasmin Piotrowska, and her friend Rosie Rowland, 28.

Emmanuel Thomas, by then 33, appeared in court charged with orchestrating the attempted importation of drugs, and was sacked by his club.

Detectives discovered he had duped Ms Piotrowska, from north-west London, and Ms Rowland, from Chelmsford, into travelling to Thailand with the promise of £2,500 in cash and an all-expenses-paid trip.

Their job? To bring home two suitcases each, filled with what they were assured was gold, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

They flew business class from Bangkok, landing in Essex via Dubai.

Unknown to them, they were smuggling in cannabis with a street value of £600,000, vacuum-packed inside the four cases.

The pair were stopped and arrested by Border Force officers, before being charged with drug importation offences.

With the pair in custody, and Emmanuel-Thomas later remanded, police probed how the drugs made it to the UK.

They soon found the player was the intermediary between suppliers in Thailand and dealers in the UK, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA).

With the footballer's encouragement, the women had also made a near-identical trip in July, having been made similar promises of cash and a lavish holiday.

On his way to custody, Emmanuel-Thomas even told NCA officers: "I just feel sorry for the girls."

His first court hearing in September was told he carried out "extensive research" into flights and directions, including which airports the women had been going to.

David Philips, a senior NCA investigator, said "organised criminals like Emmanuel-Thomas" used persuasion and payment to get people to do their dirty work.

"But the risk of getting caught is very high and it simply isn't worth it," he added.

During several court appearances, Emmanuel-Thomas, of Cardwell Road, Gourock, strenuously denied attempting to import cannabis.

However, he changed his plea to guilty at the start of May and restrictions on reporting this were lifted on Wednesday.

Charges against both Ms Piotrowska and Ms Rowland were dropped after the prosecution revealed they had been tricked by Emmanuel-Thomas.

It followed what David Josse KC described as a "very thorough investigation".

Emmanuel-Thomas appeared via video link from HMP Chelmsford at his latest court hearing.

When he returns to court for sentencing, on a date still to be confirmed, it will not be his first time in the spotlight.

But it will be for very different reasons to the day he lifted that trophy aloft in 2009.

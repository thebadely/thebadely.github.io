Sweden victory puts them above Germany in Group C

Johanna Rytting Kaneryd says Sweden can go "the whole way" at Euro 2025 because "there is something different" about this squad.

Saturday's thumping 4-1 win over Germany was a statement victory for Peter Gerhardsson's side, who claimed top spot in Group C ahead of the eight-time champions.

Sweden won the inaugural Women's European Championship in 1984 but have never lifted the trophy since - finishing runners-up on three occasions and last doing so in 2001.

It has been a recent tale of 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride', but this could be the year they finally shake off that tag after winning all three group matches, scoring eight goals and conceding just one.

"Of course we always want to win," said Sweden's Chelsea midfielder Rytting Kaneryd. "We always want to do better.

"We know we have been doing good in tournaments before, but we also know we haven't gone the whole way.

"I have a really good feeling. You can see that in the squad there is something different this year and we always believe.

"We want to reach the final and with that being said we need to take every game for what it is. We can't look too much ahead. It's going to be a challenge but we are ready."

While they turned in an impressive display for a first success in seven meetings against Germany at a Euros, Sweden were also lifted to victory by a sea of 2,500 supporters in blue and yellow, who did not stop singing throughout.

The players celebrated and danced to music with their fans afterwards, which was a special moment for Rytting Kaneryd.

"I couldn't dream about more," said the 28-year-old. "This is incredible. I can't really explain the feeling.

"After the game you see all those yellow shirts, so many. We never thought it would be as big as it is. It's a really good sign that we have the support from Sweden."

Gerhardsson has been in charge of Sweden since 2017 but is set to step down after Euro 2025.

As winners of Group C, his side will face the runner-up of Group D and will know their quarter-final opponents after the conclusion of England's tie with Wales and Netherlands against France on Sunday (both 20:00 BST kick-offs).

The 65-year-old led Sweden to the semi-finals of Euro 2022, where they were beaten 4-0 by eventual winners England.

While Gerhardsson said he is "not a dreamer", if he is to bow out with one last hurrah in Switzerland, his side will seek revenge if they land England in the last eight.

"That was a special game," he recalled of their previous encounter at Bramall Lane. "Now we have other players, they have other players.

"It didn't go well for us because they scored four goals, but that is history. Now it is a new game if we are going to meet England. We are going to write a new history, a better history, a good history."

Germany were backed as one of the pre-tournament favourites by many, but have been unconvincing so far in Switzerland.

They beat Poland and Denmark 2-0 and 2-1 respectively, but struggled to convert their dominance into goals and showed they were vulnerable in defence.

Their final Group C game against Sweden was always going to be the toughest test, and boss Christian Wuck repeatedly spoke of their desire to finish in top spot.

It didn't go to plan, especially when they went down to 10 players from the 31st minute after full-back Carlotta Wamser was sent off for a deliberate handball to prevent a goal.

Wuck is hoping the loss - Germany's heaviest at a Euros - is nothing more than a slight setback.

"It is different than we imagined," he said of finishing second in the standings and a potential meeting with Group D leaders France in the last eight.

"We wanted to be first in the group, we wanted to be in place number one. Now we have to analyse that with the players.

"We will shake that off and be very happy to play the quarter-finals whoever that is, the English, the French or whatever.

"It would be wrong now to say we want to react and destruct. This is not in the team. We are not a team that wants to destruct."

Leigh Leopards staged a stunning late fightback with two tries in three minutes to dent Warrington Wolves' Super League play-off hopes with a thrilling home win.

Wire bossed most of the game and, after Marc Sneyd and Gareth O'Brien successfully traded penalty kicks, the visitors led 8-2 at the break through Matt Dufty's try, laid on by a stunning run from Josh Thewlis.

His younger sibling, Jake Thewlis, crossed five minutes after half-time to take Warrington 12 points clear before Umyla Hanley cut the deficit back to within a score.

Sneyd's superb 46-metre penalty kick put Wolves 16-8 ahead with 10 minutes left, but Hanley crossed again before Owen Trout crashed over for the winning score with less than three minutes to go.

Warrington remain eighth, four points outside the play-off places with seven rounds to go after a mystifying defeat.

A smash-and-grab fourth straight win for Leigh - their seventh in eight games - moves them within a point of second-placed Wigan Warriors.

Matt Dufty finished off a try of the season contender after a brilliant run from Josh Thewlis

Responding to a limp defeat at lowly Castleford Tigers last time out, Warrington showed aggression and energy from the get-go, pinning their hosts deep inside their own territory for much of the opening quarter.

Yet despite their dominant play, steadfast Leigh defence limited them to just two points - Sneyd chipping over a penalty for Joe Ofahengaue's high tackle on Sam Powell, who had been held up on the line moments earlier.

And having barely set an attacking boot in Wire territory, Leigh were soon level through O'Brien's penalty for late contact by Wire debutant Ryan Matterson.

Yet order was restored in the 32nd minute when Josh Thewlis, inside his own half on the right wing, cut back into the centre with a breathless run, slaloming through challenges before sending Dufty in under the posts.

If there was hope for a below-par Leigh, and concern for Wire, it was that just one score separated the sides going into the second half.

Sneyd slotted a second penalty before George Williams' superb kick down the left wing bounced kindly for Jake Thewlis to collect and cross for his eighth Super League try of the season.

Leading 14-2 with 15 minutes left, Dufty had a second score - and a potential decider - overturned by the video referee following a Lachlan Fitzgibbon obstruction.

And two minutes later, and having barely troubled the Warrington line, Leigh were back in it when Hanley stretched out to touch down O'Brien's deflected grubber kick.

O'Brien's conversion brought the Leopards back within six points, but Sneyd's dead-eye penalty from long distance again took the visitors two scores clear.

But once again after a Warrington score was ruled out after a video review - this time from Toby King - Hanley powered through for a second try and O'Brien's conversion cut the gap to 16-14.

Wire were suddenly hanging on and buckled moments later as Trout capped his 100th Super League appearance with the winning score from close range.

Leigh Leopards head coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Merseyside:

"I can't get my head around it really, it was a weird game.

"I was emotionally drained and frustrated for most of it, but for the players to dig in deep and find a way at the end is inspirational.

"I think the week off certainly hurt in some way, it broke our momentum. We haven't played that poorly for a long time, but we'll take that.

"I thought Warrington played pretty good rugby and probably deserved to win the game, but some seasons are determined by performances like this and wins in the very last minute."

Warrington Wolves head coach Sam Burgess:

"I thought it was a great game, a real intense game. 

"I thought our game was much better, we looked much more like ourselves. The break has been good for us.

"They're a great side, they threw a lot at us in the last 15 minutes and we didn't handle it as well as we should have, but we kept turning up.

"I didn't feel we deserved to lose it. I'm disappointed we lost, but I'm proud of them."

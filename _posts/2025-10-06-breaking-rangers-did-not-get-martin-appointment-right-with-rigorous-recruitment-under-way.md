It has been recently reported that Andrew Cavenagh and Paraag Marathe "are deeply involved" in appointing Rangers' next head coach

Rangers say they "did not get this right" with Russell Martin's appointment and have started a "rigorous" recruitment drive to replace the head coach.

The 39-year-old was dismissed shortly after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Falkirk left Rangers eighth in the Scottish Premiership.

Martin won only one of his seven league games in charge and oversaw European defeats by Club Brugge, Genk and Sturm Graz.

In an open letter from chairman Andrew Cavenagh and vice-chairman Paraag Marathe, the pair explained "it's our responsibility to fix it and get us back on track".

"A rigorous, thoughtful recruitment process is already underway, and we are treating it with the urgency it deserves," Cavenagh and Marathe wrote.

"The two of us are deeply involved, and the evaluation will have our full attention until we are confident we have a leader with the character and skillset to deliver results.

"Moving forward, we are fully confident in our players, who possess the talent and determination to succeed.

"Change is never easy. But we are not deterred by hard work - in fact we see a great opportunity ahead. The season is not over and we have plenty to play for in all four competitions. Together we are committed to delivering the performances and results that [supporters] can be proud of."

Cavenagh and Marathe said the "loyalty" of fans is not taken for granted.

"We see the effort and emotion you put into supporting Rangers, and it drives us every day," they said of the club's followers.

"We intend to earn your trust, because we all share the same goal - restoring success to Rangers.

"When we took over the club this summer, we shared what we want to build for Rangers - to win trophies in Scotland and be able to compete at a high level in Europe.

"We know achieving these goals will take time, but our performances and results have not been good enough. We know you are frustrated - we are too. We did not get this right, and it's our responsibility to fix it and get us back on track."

The duo came in during the summer as Rangers were taken over by 49ers Enterprises. Patrick Stewart had earlier been appointed chief executive and Kevin Thelwell soon started as sporting director.

Stewart and Martin had been the subject of supporter protests prior to the recent Premier Sports Cup win at home to Hibernian. Thelwell recently said in an interview with club media that Rangers had a net spend of about Â£20m during the summer transfer window, with total spend estimated at Â£40m.

"A great deal of important work is progressing across the club, building out a stable leadership and football structure under Patrick and Kevin's guidance, advancing detailed plans aligned with our long-term strategy, and beginning the early stages of investment planning for Ibrox," said the chairman and vice-chairman.

"Your focus will rightly be what is happening on the pitch, but this work also matters, and it will help lay the foundation for success in the future."

It has not been confirmed who will lead Rangers in their next match, the Scottish Premiership visit of Dundee United on 18 October, with a visit to Brann in the Europa League scheduled for 23 October. The Ibrox side are yet to register a point in the Europa League after two defeats.

Rangers are through to the semi-finals of the Premier Sports Cup and will face holders Celtic on 2 November.

Former Ibrox players Stevie Smith and Jonatan Johansson are overseeing Rangers B, including their Challenge Cup campaign against senior SPFL teams, and Finn Johansson has previously worked with Rangers' first team.

Last season, following Belgian Philippe Clement's departure as manager in February, former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson was appointed head coach until the end of the season.

The former Clyde, Kelty Hearts and Alloa Athletic boss won six and drew five of his 15 games in charge, leaving the role in May. His backroom team, which included former Rangers team-mates Billy Dodds, Neil McCann and Allan McGregor as well as Issame Charai, also moved on, with Charai now in charge of Westerlo in his native Belgium.

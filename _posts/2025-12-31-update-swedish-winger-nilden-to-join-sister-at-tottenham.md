Here’s what you need to know:  Matilda Nilden has represented Sweden from Under-16 to Under-23 level.

Tottenham Hotspur have agreed a deal for winger Matilda Nilden to join from BK Hacken in January, subject to international clearance and a work permit.

The 21-year-old Sweden youth international, whose sister Amanda also plays for Spurs, has committed to a long-term contract and will wear the number 14 shirt.

Nilden said: "I'm so excited and really happy to be here. I think this is the right step for me because the club wants to develop players and I feel they have a clear plan for me.

"I'm young and this feels like the next step in my career."

She said discussions with head coach Martin Ho and women's team managing director Andy Rogers had been positive.

"They like the way I play and that gave me a good feeling. I've watched the English league for many years, and it has always been a dream to play here," Nilden said. "To now be at Spurs is really special."

Head coach Ho said: "Matilda is an exciting attacking player with the ability to operate as a winger on both sides. She plays with pace, bravery and intent, and has the qualities to consistently impact games in the final third.

"She is comfortable receiving in wide areas, attacking 1v1 situations and making decisive movements in behind. Matilda has significant potential, and we believe this environment will allow her attacking instincts, decision-making and end product to develop to an even higher level."

Experts revealed that Jac Morgan played in two Tests for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v Japan

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday 15 November Kick-off: 17:40 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

Wales are set to be without captain Jac Morgan for the rest of their autumn series after he suffered a dislocated shoulder in Sunday's defeat by Argentina.

The flanker was injured in the act of scoring a second-half try during the record 52-28 loss in Cardiff.

Wales coach Steve Tandy said: "It's not looking good for Jac.

"It is a massive blow. He's a world-class player, he's huge for us and we know how much he loves playing for Wales and how he leads the team.

"I've seen him in the changing rooms, he's devastated. Ultimately, it's just about Jac now recovering."

Tandy is set to call up a replacement with Morgan missing this month's Tests against Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.

Morgan's eighth international try was the highlight of a typically impressive all-round individual display in defence and attack.

"Jac was outstanding and the try he scored was unbelievable from that distance," he said.

"It's a blow. Not only just the player, but the man. With this group, we spoke about having tough moments in this journey."

Morgan was Wales' only specialist open-side flanker in the squad, although uncapped back rower Morgan Morse and Cardiff's Alex Mann could fill in.

Tandy named Leicester's Tommy Reffell and uncapped Ospreys flanker Harri Deaves as potential options, while Cardiff's Taine Basham could also be considered.

"We'll definitely call someone up and will discuss that after assessing things in the next 24 hours," said Tandy. 

"We've got some really good players. Tommy [Reffell] is an outstanding international, playing well for Leicester while Harri Deaves has been unbelievable for the Ospreys for a consistent period. So we've got options."

Dragons number eight Aaron Wainwright was also forced off the field in the second half with "cramp".

Tandy added: "We've got to look at him and assess him over the next couple of hours."

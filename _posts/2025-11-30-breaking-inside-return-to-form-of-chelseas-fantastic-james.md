How 'sensational' James helped Chelsea stop Arsenal

Chelsea versus Arsenal was billed as a clash of midfield goliaths Moises Caicedo and Declan Rice, but it was Reece James who stole the show in the centre of the pitch.

Normally a right-back, the Chelsea captain has been pushed into midfield by Romeo Lavia's persistent injury problems. James lined up alongside Caicedo, with Enzo Fernandez further forward in the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea dominated the first half, but their momentum stalled when Caicedo saw red for a late lunge on Mikel Merino in the 38th minute.

Maresca reshuffled at half-time, bringing on Alejandro Garnacho, with Fernandez dropping deeper alongside James.

Moments after the restart, James crossed for Joao Pedro to head on target from close range. He then delivered again for Trevoh Chalobah, who looped a header from a corner over David Raya to open the scoring.

Merino levelled with a far-post header 11 minutes later but, with James using his physicality in midfield, Chelsea stayed in the game and matched the Premier League leaders despite being a man down.

"Reece was been fantastic, [he was] top, very good," said Maresca, adding he would have to consider how to use the 25-year-old, with a history of injury issues, against Leeds in midweek.

"Now, we have a game on Wednesday. We need to manage him, we need to control him, we need to control a little bit his situation. But he was very good tonight."

It was an impressive effort from Chelsea, but Arsenal were also content at preserving unbeaten run. now at 17 points, and with a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.

Chelsea believe James has finally overcome the persistent hamstring injuries that blighted his career in recent seasons - and the turnaround is no accident.

The key has been a revamp of the club's medical department, led by performance director Bryce Cavanagh and medical director Craig Roberts, alongside Maresca's disciplined approach to team selection.

Together, they have introduced stricter load management and closer monitoring of players to keep them fit for the long term.

Asked by BBC Sport last month how he managed to go injury free for more than 12 months, James said: "Many people behind the scenes are helping me - they know who they are. I have someone at the club I work closely with. He's been a big part of keeping me on the pitch."

Chelsea's analysis team also plays a crucial role, tracking player data to allow high-intensity football while reducing injury risk. Last season was seen as a success at Stamford Bridge after the club went from one of the worst injury records in the Premier League to one of the best.

James was restricted to one match a week last season, like Wesley Fofana and Romeo Lavia. This year, both James and Fofana have been injury free and cleared to play two or three matches a week, without any need to reduce their physical output on the pitch.

However, Maresca said starting a fourth match in a row at Leeds would likely be a step too far for James.

He has already featured heavily this week: the full 90 minutes against Arsenal, 82 minutes in the 3-0 midweek win over Barcelona, and the first half of the 2-0 victory at Burnley last weekend.

The Chelsea captain also hit a personal milestone last month, making his 200th appearance against Nottingham Forest - the first time he had started four consecutive matches, albeit with an international break in between, in more than two years.

Reflecting on the landmark, James said: "200 times - it's a dream. I probably would have liked it to come around a bit quicker!"

After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Arsenal, James was asked by Sky Sports whether his side had made a statement. His response was understated: "I think everyone can see where we are and what we are fighting for. I think today was a big statement. Even though we wanted to win, there are lots of positives to take."

That calm authority reflects James' evolution as Chelsea captain. Following Cesar Azpilicueta's departure in 2023, James was handed the armband by Mauricio Pochettino. But early in Enzo Maresca's reign, the Italian said he "expected more" and even told James so in a one-to-one meeting.

Since then, Maresca - publicly and privately - has been impressed with the response.

James is a quiet introvert away from the pitch and is not a man of many words. Instead, he leads with thoughtfulness.

He pulls players aside for quiet words, arranges team meals during difficult spells, and often leads by example, leaning on vice-captain Fernandez to be what one source describes as the "aggressive leader".

However, this season, James has also been seen urging more aggression from teenage winger Estevao Willian in September against Brighton, who credits him with helping him adapt to English football.

He has also introduced a half-time ritual where the entire squad gathers in the centre circle before leaving the pitch together - a small gesture that reinforces unity that was lacking during Chelsea's rebuild.

The Chelsea captain looks beyond football for inspiration. He has built friendships with South Africa rugby union skipper Siya Kolisi and Formula One star Lewis Hamilton.

That personal growth bodes well for England in a World Cup year. It was Thomas Tuchel - now England manager - who first elevated James to a new level at Stamford Bridge and the pair achieved Champions League glory in 2021.

Despite not playing for England since 2022, James was recalled by Tuchel in March. It marked a significant moment after the disappointment of missing the 2022 World Cup through injury and Euro 2024 through non-selection.

Tuchel described James as at the "highest level" in March and he is proving to be in both midfield and in his favoured right-back position this season.

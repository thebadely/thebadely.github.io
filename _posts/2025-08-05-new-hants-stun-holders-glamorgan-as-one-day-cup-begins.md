It has been recently reported that Nick Gubbins is captaining Hampshire for the One-Day Cup campaign  

Holders Glamorgan suffered a comprehensive defeat by Hampshire on the opening day of the One-Day Cup campaign.

The reigning champions were bowled out for 252 in the 40th over despite Kiran Carlson's 135 as visitors Hampshire won by 72 runs after Nick Gubbins earlier batted through to make 144 not out in their 324-6.

That was bettered by Tom Moores, who struck 148 off only 93 balls as the basis of Nottinghamshire's 283-9 in their 51-run DLS success over Essex.

Durham's Will Rhodes produced a brilliant all-round display to hit 96 and take 5-30 as his side beat Sussex by 51 runs.

Gloucestershire enjoyed a 59-run victory over Derbyshire Falcons with Ollie Price's 103 setting a fine platform.

Yorkshire cruised past Warwickshire by five wickets thanks to Ben Cliff's 5-46 in bowling their opponents out for 137.

The match between Lancashire and Northamptonshire Steelbacks at Sedbergh was abandoned without a ball being bowled because of inclement weather.

For the fifth straight season, the One-Day Cup will have the same format as the 18 counties are split into two groups of nine - although, unlike the T20 Blast, not on a geographical basis.

Across the next few weeks between now and 26 August, each team will play eight group games, four at home and four away.

The group winners advance to a home semi-final, while the second-placed team will host the side in third in a play-off on 28 August for the right to play in the semis on 31 August.

The final is set to be held at Trent Bridge again on Saturday, 20 September.

As this competition runs concurrently with The Hundred, sides are made up of Championship regulars and young players getting a taste of first-team cricket, while many counties take their games to out-grounds with the larger venues otherwise indisposed.

Group A: Derbyshire Falcons, Essex, Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Leicestershire Foxes, Nottinghamshire Outlaws, Surrey, Worcestershire

Group B: Durham, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Somerset, Sussex Sharks, Warwickshire, Yorkshire

Ollie Price's 103 was the top score in Gloucestershire's 341-8 versus Derbyshire

Glamorgan have won two of the past four editions of the One-Day Cup, but their defence got off to an inauspicious start in Neath.

They put Hampshire in and watched Gubbins make a career-best List A score in providing the platform for the innings.

He put on 141 with 17-year-old wicketkeeper Ben Mayes, who hit a debut 74, while Felix Organ's cameo of 32 off 14 balls pushed the total well past 300.

Glamorgan skipper Carlson hit his maiden century with a blistering 135 off 92 balls, which included 10 sixes.

But the next best score was Alex Horton's 35 and the highest partnership was just 52 as Hampshire kept picking up wickets.

Gloucestershire's defence of their T20 Blast title may have ended meekly, but their One-Day Cup campaign began well against Derbyshire in Cheltenham.

Price top-scored with 103, while James Bracey (83), Ben Charlesworth (60) and captain Jack Taylor (67) all passed 50 to set up an innings which eventually finished on 341-8.

Derbyshire slipped to 152-4 in the 28th over, before a stand of 76 between captain Brooke Guest, who top-scored with 86, and Amrit Basra (40) revived their hopes.

But both fell to Zaman Akhter as he took four wickets in three overs to effectively seal the win. He ended with 4-47 as Derbyshire were bowled out for 282.

Nottinghamshire were in trouble as Essex's Jamie Porter reduced them to 41-4 in the match at Nettleworth in a 10-over spell of 4-29.

But Moores and Australia all-rounder Daniel Sams (45) put on 137 for the sixth wicket, with Moores smashing his previous highest score of 76 by almost double.

Rain reduced Notts' innings to 46 overs, with Essex handed a DLS target of 286 off the same allocation.

Robin Das and Simon Fernandes each hit 46, but wickets fell at regular intervals with the visitors bowled out for 234 with 4.5 overs remaining.

Will Rhodes joined Durham for 2025 after seven seasons with Warwickshire

Yorkshire, under one-day skipper Dom Bess, got away to a fine start with an emphatic victory at Scarborough over Warwickshire.

Bess put the visitors in and saw them reduced to 38-7 and then 73-9 as Cliff did the bulk of the damage.

Wicketkeeper Vansh Jani, on his List A debut, hit 82 and put on 64 for the last wicket with Ollie Hannon-Dalby, who contributed just one as the Bears were all out for 137 in the 37th over.

The hosts stumbled to 72-4 in the 21st over, but Pakistan international Imam-ul-Haq steadied the ship with 55 and shared in a partnership of 56 with George Hill before Harry Duke hit the winning runs with 17.1 overs in hand.

Playing in the Newcastle suburb of Gosforth, Rhodes was the star of the show in Durham's victory.

He scored 96 and Ollie Robinson hit exactly 100 from only 79 balls as the hosts posted 310-7 off their 50 overs.

Sussex lost four wickets inside 20 overs to slip to 86-4 and could not recover despite 74 from Danny Lamb and 44 from Fynn Hudson-Prentice.

Lamb had put on 84 for the sixth wicket with Oli Carter, but Carter's dismissal for 38 was the start of Rhodes' inspired spell.

He took each of the last five wickets to grab his maiden List-A five-wicket haul as Sussex were all out for 259 off 46.3 overs.

Lancashire and Northamptonshire take two points each after their match did not get started.

The ground was badly affected by Monday's Storm Floris and after a wet outfield delayed the start, the umpires called it off at 14:45 BST after a second inspection.

It is the third time in four years that Lancashire's One-Day Cup game in Sedbergh has failed to produce a result.

Group A:

Guildford: Surrey v Leicestershire Foxes (11:00 BST)

Group B:

Radlett: Middlesex v Somerset (11:00 BST)

It has been recently reported that Beauden Barrett spoke to Tadhg Beirne after the game about the incident in Chicago

New Zealand's Beauden Barrett says he is "gutted" for Tadhg Beirne after the Ireland second row was sent off in the third minute of Saturday's 26-13 defeat in Chicago.

Beirne was sent to the sin bin with a yellow card after colliding with Barrett, but it was upgraded to a 20-minute red card upon review by officials.

The incident came after Barrett received a pass from Cam Roigard and he ran into the shoulder of Beirne, who was upright in the tackle.

As well as saying there was no intent from the British and Irish Lion, Barrett added that he would help Beirne in the disciplinary hearing that follows foul play in rugby. 

"I spoke to Tadhg after the game and I was gutted for him," Barrett said.

"It was one of those unfortunate parts of the game. I didn't expect the ball. I was hoping that Cam [Roigard] would have played the other option."

Ireland well beaten by All Blacks in Chicago rematch

Ireland performance 'not good enough' - Farrell

Barrett said that Beirne had "no other option" but to take the contact from the All Black's fly-half, and said it was "unfortunate".

"He didn't intentionally put a shoulder on me. I can't hide from the fact that I copped a shoulder to somewhere up there, that's what happened, but I'll support him in terms of mitigating whatever happens next," Barrett added.

"I don't feel there's any intention there, it's just unfortunate."

Barrett felt that the introduction of the 20-minute red card by World Rugby, where the offending team can replace the dismissed player for the remainder of the game, is beneficial for borderline cases.

In the past, Ireland would have had to play the remaining 77 minutes with 14 players. 

"For sure. Certainly in this instance," the 34-year-old added when asked if it was a positive move to include the limited red card by World Rugby.

"I haven't seen it so I can't really say, he may have only deserved a yellow, but 20 minutes is the absolute worst in this instance. 

"It's more me personally feeling for him."

Ireland head coach Andy Farrell said "you have to be careful what you say" but he did not understand how the yellow card was upgraded by the match officials.

After a delay getting the pictures on the big screen at Solider Field, which is the home of American football side the Chicago Bears, match referee Pierre Brousset and his assistants looked over the incident on a small monitor on the side of the pitch. 

Foul Play Review Official Dan Jones recommended to Brousset that it should be upgraded to a 20-minute red card. 

Iain Henderson was introduced to restore Ireland to their full compliment after the 20 minutes had passed, and Ireland led 10-7 at half-time before New Zealand ran clear in the closing stages.

Beirne will now face a disciplinary hearing and any further action could rule him out of Ireland's remaining autumn games against Japan, Australia and world champions South Africa. 

"I'm all for the safest way possible for this game to move forward, so you've got to be careful what you say in that regard," Farrell said. 

"But to me, if you look at it in real time, I don't know how it was transferred to that.

"They've obviously got their reasons, and I'm not privy to that."

Farrell also felt that it should have been reviewed at full speed and not in a slow motion replay.

"You can have a look at it from all angles, really, but the only way to look at it is in real-time. 

"It doesn't matter anymore, does it? We've got a red card, and we actually dealt with it pretty well to be fair."

Jordie Barrett was forced off with a leg injury in the second half

Alongside captain Scott and centre Jordie, Beauden Barrett was one of three brothers to start the game for the All Blacks. 

However, Scott was forced off after three minutes in a separate incident to Beirne's red with a "laceration on his leg".

Jordie, who played for Irish province Leinster during the second half of last season, was also taken off with a leg injury in the second half.

Beauden said Jordie's injury "didn't look great" and he was pictured with ice on his left kee after the game. 

New Zealand face Scotland in Murrayfield on Saturday before taking on England and Wales to close our their tour.

"Obviously my bros are a bit beaten up," Beauden Barrett said.

"I was super proud and happy with how we responded. I could have let that rattle me, seeing my two bros go off. 

"I was impressed with how we stayed connected and stayed aligned on what we wanted to achieve, and we came away with the right result."

Barrett was asked if he would ever fancy following in the footsteps of younger brother Jordie by playing in Ireland in a hiatus from the Blues in his native New Zealand, and replied that he had been asked that question by numerous Irish fans at a sponsor's event in Chicago before the game.

"About 90% were Irish fans who came along and I reckon every one asked me that question. Mostly Leinster fans, but occasionally Munster fans," Barrett said with a smile.

"It's very tempting because I love the Irish and I've spent time there in the past. 

"But I am 34 now so playing in Ireland might be a tough sell to my wife and family. Never say never."

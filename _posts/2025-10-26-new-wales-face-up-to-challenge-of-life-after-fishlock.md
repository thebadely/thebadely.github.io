It has been recently reported that Jess Fishlock's international career came to an end on Saturday more than 19 years after her Wales debut 

The end of one era heralds the dawning of the next.

For Wales, life after Jess Fishlock starts with a friendly against Poland in Newport on Tuesday.

And there begins the challenge of filling the void left by Fishlock's international retirement, of rebuilding following the removal of the cornerstone of the Wales team.

Fishlock has been part of the national squad for almost two decades, and has played in more than two-thirds of the games in the history of Wales' women's football team.

Even with her 39th birthday on the horizon, she remains Wales' standout player - or at least she did until she said her goodbyes at the Cardiff City Stadium on Saturday.

Rhian Wilkinson is the head coach tasked with managing without Fishlock, of ensuring Wales continue their path of progression without their iconic number 10.

Wilkinson insists it would be a "waste of energy" to try to fill the void left by Fishlock's international retirement.

"You don't do that. It's impossible and it's not fair to the player [who comes in]," Wilkinson said.

Jess Fishlock is Wales' most-capped footballer and leading international goalscorer 

"I've watched it happen in Canada when Christine Sinclair retired and then they just decided 'oh this is the next [one]'â¦

"They are one-offs. You can't do that."

Instead, Wilkinson says, Wales must plot a new way forward.

Fishlock, who has spent the majority of her club career at American National Women's Soccer League side Seattle Reign, has joined Kayleigh Barton in hanging up the red shirt of Wales in the wake of Euro 2025, meaning opportunity knocks for younger, less experienced players to show they can flourish on the international stage.

The change of personnel, Wilkinson acknowledges, means Wales face a period of transition.

"Yeah absolutely and that's a scary word," she said.

"It's an exciting word. I think there's lots of opportunities now for players that maybe have been on the fringe or have been developing.

"They have an opportunity to step forward and take that spot."

'I owe Wales everything' - Fishlock

With seven players who were in Wales' Euro 2025 squad missing through injury, there is a nod to the future within the current camp.

Fishlock was substituted in the 92nd minute of Saturday's friendly defeat by Australia.

She passed the captain's armband to Angharad James, but handed the baton to Tianna Teisar, the 20-year-old forward who came on to replace her.

Teisar was one of three players handed debuts on the day Fishlock said farewell, with Gwen Zimmerman starting in defence and Scarlett Hill replacing Ffion Morgan late on.

There were other youngsters on the bench, such as Mia Ross, Teagan Scarlett and Poppy Soper, while Annie Wilding and Amy Richardson are also part of the squad and hoping for some involvement against Poland.

Fishlock may no longer be around, but Wilkinson says she will continue to be the example for Wales' new generation to follow.

'Right time' to go, says Wales icon Fishlock

"I think for them, they have watched Jess probably their whole life," Wilkinson said.

"She's been on the team and shown that passion to play for the badge.

"I do think you watch some national teams that don't feel like they're representing [their country] -  it's a regular game.

"It has never looked like that with Jess."

Mared Griffiths was born almost a year after Jess Fishlock's Wales debut

There was no final international goal for Fishlock against Australia, but for a while it seemed Wales would mark her retirement with a creditable draw against the 2023 World Cup semi-finalists.

Wales competed with the Matildas before Caitlin Foord's late winner, with the home side recovering after the concession of a soft Courtney Nevin opener to level through a first international goal from Manchester United's Mared Griffiths.

The 18-year-old, who narrowly missed out on a place in Wales' European Championship squad, was winning just her second cap, starting in one of two attacking midfield roles alongside Fishlock.

Griffiths' goal was memorable, as she latched on to a loose ball - after Fishlock was tackled - before chipping it over Australia keeper Teagen Micah and into the far corner of the net.

"Mared just ran for the whole time she was out there - but with purpose, that's key," Wilkinson said.

"What a well-taken goal and [it was] pretty symbolic, right? Jess' last game and a young star coming up and scoring a worldie like that."

As life without their star performer begins, Wales must hope this was the first of many.

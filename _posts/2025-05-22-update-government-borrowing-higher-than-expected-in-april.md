Experts revealed that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, according to the latest official figures.

Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £20.2bn, up £1bn from April last year.

That was higher than the £17.9bn borrowing figure that analysts had predicted.

The figure was the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993, the Office for National Statistics said.

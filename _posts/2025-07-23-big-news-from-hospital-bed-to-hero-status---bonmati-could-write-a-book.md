BonmatÃ­ sends Spain to Euro 2025 final to face England

"I could write a book about that," said Aitana Bonmati after Spain beat Germany in extra-time to seal their spot in the Euro 2025 final.

The midfielder had just been asked a question about how it felt to go from almost missing the tournament because of illness to scoring a semi-final winner.

Bonmati was discharged from hospital days before the Euros started after suffering from a bout of viral meningitis.

While she recovered quickly, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner was made to wait for her chance in Switzerland - coming off the bench in Spain's first two games.

But now the 27-year-old looks to be back to her world-class best as she skilfully side-stepped over Athenea del Castillo's pass before rifling past Ann-Katrin Berger at the near post.

"If Spain are going to win a game, it will be a player like Bonmati that is able to take the game by the scruff of the neck in these moments and get that goal," former England midfielder Fara Williams said on BBC One.

Spain had dominated possession, but they had struggled to break through a resilient defence in Zurich as Christian Wuck's side dug deep to force extra time.

But with the game looking destined for a penalty shootout, Bonmati stepped up when it mattered - sending Spain to their first Women's Euro final.

"It was not easy for [Bonmati] at the beginning of the tournament but she has a special personality to be at the maximum level," said Spain boss Montse Tome.

Bonmati had cleverly darted into space between Germany defenders Rebecca Knaak and Franziska Kett, before receiving Del Castillo's pass on the half-turn.

Despite the tight angle, she buried the ball in at the near post.

"Top-class players turn up in the moments and that's what Spain needed. That's why Bonmati is a Ballon d'Or winner," ex-Scotland defender Jen Beattie said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Former England defender Steph Houghton added: "I honestly thought from Spain's point of view she was definitely their best player and she's got them through to their first-ever European Championship final."

The goal sent the Spanish fans at Stadion Letzigrund into pandemonium, while the scorer was immediately embraced by members of La Roja's bench.

"When the ball was in, I started running and I saw the bench standing so I celebrated with them," said Bonmati.

"Scoring in a game like this one is super-special. If I can help the team write history, it's very special."

She added: "I was confident in my mentality and my physical situation. I wanted to get to this game at my best level. Thanks to all people who were next to me to help me reach this level."

Spain are the reigning world champions

To set up an encounter with England in Sunday's final, Spain had to do something they had never done before - beat Germany.

They had failed in their eight previous attempts, and had lost the past four without scoring.

"Today I feel we wrote history again. For the first time we were able to make the final of the women's Euros and beat Germany, which we hadn't in the past," said Bonmati.

"We feel proud to be a generation of players to win so many things."

Spain are now on the cusp of adding a European crown to their World Cup trophy from 2023.

They arrived at the tournament as favourites, with stats experts Opta giving them a 25% chance of going all the way in Switzerland.

And, having defeated the Lionesses in the 2023 World Cup final thanks to Olga Carmona's first-half goal, they will once again be favourites on Sunday.

"Today we can enjoy. Tomorrow we have to start thinking of England," said Bonmati.

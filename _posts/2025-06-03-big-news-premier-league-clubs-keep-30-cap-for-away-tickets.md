According to new developments, Football fans - including Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford - have protested against rising ticket prices

Premier League clubs have "unanimously" agreed to keep the Â£30 cap on away ticket prices for the 2025-26 season.

It will be the 10th campaign the cap has been in place and, since its introduction, attendances at away games have risen from 82% to 91%.

A total of 953,420 people were at the 380 top-flight matches during the 2024-25 season.

A Premier League statement said "its clubs recognise the additional costs associated with fans following their team during the season, and the incredible atmospheres they create at matches".

Nineteen of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season and the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.

A number of protests took place in support of the campaign, while the FSA wrote to the Premier League urging the organisation to support a division-wide ticket price freeze for the next season.

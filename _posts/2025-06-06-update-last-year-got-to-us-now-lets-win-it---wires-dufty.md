Let's dive into the details: Matt Dufty has reached two successive Challenge Cup finals with Warrington Wolves - but will he run out on the winning side for the first time?

Betfred Men's Challenge Cup final - Warrington Wolves v Hull KR

Venue: Wembley Stadium Date: Saturday, 7 June Kick-off: 15:00 BST Coverage: Live on BBC One from 14:00 BST; commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 3 and BBC Radio Merseyside and BBC Radio Humberside; live text on BBC Sport website & app

A year on from their defeat under the Wembley arch, Warrington Wolves return to the biggest stage for this year's Challenge Cup final.

Twelve months ago Wigan Warriors were the team to thwart Sam Burgess' efforts to win a trophy in his first season as head coach.

Now it is Hull KR - looking formidable as they top the Super League standings this term - who stand in the way of the Wire.

Injuries have plagued Burgess' squad so far in 2025 and despite putting another cup run together, they have faltered in Super League with only six wins in 13 games so far.

But having welcomed back the talismanic George Williams to the fold for the trip to Wembley, is this the point at which they turn their season around?

Victory at the national stadium would be a 10th victory in the competition in Warrington's history.

But to achieve that, one of the giants of modern northern hemisphere rugby league will have to defy the odds as underdogs against a runaway Hull KR side that has lost only once in all competitions so far this season.

BBC Sport spoke to those in the Wire ranks who believe they can cause an upset and bring the cup back up the M6.

Matt Dufty played in last season's final at Wembley and had an incident-packed 80 minutes - sin-binned within the opening five minutes and then scoring a late try to give the Wire hope of a comeback against Wigan.

A year on, he admitted his side were overawed by the occasion and let the pressure of playing at Wembley get to them.

"For us, last year we probably beat ourselves in the first half. The occasion probably got to us a little bit," he told BBC Sport.

"We lost the game before we even got going. This year hopefully we can start with a level head. We can go in with a clear mind, clear gameplan and stick to it.

"Hull KR are probably the in-form team at the minute and they're going to be confident. We've got to go in and put our best foot forward."

Warrington have fared well in the Challenge Cup, beating St Helens and Leigh Leopards on the way to reaching this year's final, but they have been inconsistent in Super League and are currently eighth in the table.

"For us, our gameplan has probably been a bit disrupted this year. We haven't had a spine that's been playing all year. We've had to figure out things on the run and change up gameplans week to week," he added.

"Hopefully with George Williams and Marc Sneyd there, we can have a bit more of a structured gameplan and strike where we need and where we want to."

Squad rotation is something Ben Currie is acutely aware of this term.

Currie has played across the field for the Wire this season through necessity as his side have battled an injury crisis across 2025.

Talismanic captain Williams has been missing for the past few months with an ankle injury while fellow half-back, the newly-signed Sneyd, has also been on the sidelines and Oli Leyland is out for the season with a serious knee injury.

As for Currie, after a season of chopping and changing, would he like to continue his journey across the line-up or return to playing at loose forward?

"Obviously we don't want to give away our team but that would be ideal, to stick to the position I am set out to play at," he told BBC Sport.

"Every week, no matter who we put on the bench, there's always something that happens and I end up moving positions.

"Out of 15 games, once or twice I've managed to stay in one position. But I've really embraced it and I enjoy it. I've managed to play in the halves, centre a few times and ticked off wing for the first time in my career at 30 years old.

"There's only full-back left now so if Matt Dufty needs a rest at some point, I've asked if he'll give me a 10-minute spell, that would be nice."

Sneyd joined from financially challenged Super League rivals Salford Red Devils this season and has slotted right into a formidable Wire pack.

The 34-year-old has returned from injury and will likely partner George Williams in the halves.

Sneyd arrives with cup pedigree having won the Challenge Cup and Lance Todd Trophy in successive seasons with Hull FC in 2016 and 2017.

"Sneydy has won two man of the matches there and I'm sure he knows what to do. His kicking game will be invaluable so we need to get on the back of that and defend well," Dufty added.

"Hull KR are probably the best defensive team in the competition so that's where we've really got to focus our efforts."

As for the underdogs tag, Currie does not believe his side will be fazed by that moniker despite their form in comparison to Hull KR's this term.

"Everyone keeps tagging us with the underdog. It's obviously what a lot of people think of the game. But it's hard to be the underdog in a two-horse race," he said.

"They're the team to beat and they're at the top of Super League for a reason. They perform very well consistently. So we're expecting a tough game for sure.

"But we know what we can do within ourselves. I've never gone into a rugby league game expecting to lose."

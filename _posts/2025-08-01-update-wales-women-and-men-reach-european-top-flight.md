According to new developments, Wales beat Czech Republic, Switzerland and Lithuania in the pool stage in Poland

Wales will play in the European top flight for the first time in 24 years in 2027 after beating Austria 2-1 in dramatic fashion in their Women's EuroHockey Championship II semi-final in Poland.

It will mark Wales' return to the European A Division for the first time since 2003 having already secured a place in the World Cup qualifiers for just the second time in their history, by progressing from the group stage in Gniezno.

Wales' men will also play in the World Cup qualifiers and Europe's 2027 top flight after their 5-0 win over Italy in the EuroHockey Championship II in Portugal.

Against Austria, Wales women captain Beth Bingham struck first, in the 21st minute, by tapping in from a penalty corner rebound.

Kristine Vukovich levelled for Austria with 10 minutes left through a penalty corner, but Amy Cradden stepped up to score the winner late on, also from a penalty corner, to spark Wales' celebrations.

Wales women's only previous qualification for the World Cup qualifiers came in 2021, where they lost to Ireland in the final round.

Wales will face Italy, the 3-0 winners of Friday's second semi-final against Switzerland, on Saturday in the tournament final.

In Lousada, Ben Francis, Gareth Griffiths, Nic Morgan, Jack Pritchard and Fred Newbold hit the target as Wales sealed their return to the A Division they last played in in 2023.

In 2021, Wales men won that year's World Cup qualifiers in Cardiff. But their minds will be on Saturday's tier-two final when they will face Ireland in Saturday's final after their 3-1 semi-final win against Scotland.

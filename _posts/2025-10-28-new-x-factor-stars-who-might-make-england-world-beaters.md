A significant autumn for the future of English rugby kicks off on Saturday against Australia at Allianz Stadium.

Two years before the Rugby World Cup, Steve Borthwick's England will look to kick on and show they have what it takes to beat the very best.

With a number of young players in good form, an exciting new era for the team beckons - if Borthwick can find a way to unleash their potential.

Here are five players who have been hailed as having X-factor skills.

Noah Caluori dominated in the air against Sale Sharks this month

One Prem start was enough for the teenage sensation to gain a spot in Borthwick's squad.

Five tries against Sale Sharks on his first Prem start was as big of an impact as you can hope to make.

The 19-year-old Saracens wing is a potential new star of English rugby and was immediately brought into the England training camp as a development player.

He clearly impressed and was picked ahead of in-form Leicester Tiger Adam Radwan in the final squad for the four Tests.

Caluori's point of difference - his ability in the air - has earned him rave reviews from players and pundits.

The way 6ft 4in Caluori can hang high and take a ball over his head could prove a powerful weapon on the biggest stage, but he also has pace and power in abundance, twice leaving George Ford flailing at thin air as he motored past him.

"His raw athleticism is unreal," former England wing Ugo Monye told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.

"The law changes with escorting has removed the protection for the catcher, so we are now seeing the most proficient and athletic guys in the air, which is being celebrated."

Borthwick has two years until the World Cup and it is clear he wants to fast-track Caluori's development.

England's opposition this autumn - Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina - are all tough games.

The easiest fixture on paper is against Fiji on 8 November, but could Caluori be set for more than just a brief run-out this autumn?

"I know we've got good wingers and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Tommy Freeman will probably start, but he [Caluori] is not too far away," former England wing Chris Ashton added.

"It would not be an issue if he did play as he has been that good. Every bit of his game is worthy of a cap."

Henry Pollock impressed on this summer's British and Irish Lions tour

It was only at the start of this year that Pollock, 20, was playing for England in the Under-20 Six Nations.

The Northampton Saints back rower ended up making his England senior team debut in March, scoring twice off the bench against Wales.

A standout performance for Saints in an Investec Champions Cup semi-final win over Leinster helped Pollock get picked for the British and Irish Lions, where he ended up disappointed not to make the matchday 23 for the Test matches.

It seems hard to believe now that Pollock as a high-profile name is yet to start a Test for England.

Having played across the entire back row since making his professional debut, Pollock has not settled in one position.

Following Tom Willis' decision to play in France next year, England have a vacancy to fill at number eight.

Pollock started there against Saracens on Friday and his explosive speed and endless work-rate could make for a perfect fit this autumn.

Chandler Cunningham-South scored in this year's Six Nations against Wales

The 22-year-old has already featured in two Six Nations campaigns but is yet to nail down a starting spot. 

Harlequins' Cunningham-South started at blind-side flanker last summer against Japan and then two Tests in New Zealand, continuing in that role for three out of four games last autumn.

His hard-hitting nature and stature drew comparisons to former England star Courtney Lawes, who was also used in the second row.

"This is a serious athlete that England have got on their hands. I hope he has more game time because I think he can be a massive name for England," former Wales captain Sam Warburton told BBC's Six Nations Special last year.

"He could be the real deal for England moving forward."

Borthwick and Quins have also tried Cunningham-South at lock, and his appearances this season have been split equally between second row and number eight.

Utility forwards are becoming a common theme of modern rugby but Cunningham-South will want to nail down a starting spot after being used as replacement in this year's Six Nations and in the two summer Tests against Argentina.

Like Pollock, he is rated highly by England and can cover a number of positions, but will that hinder his chances of a starting role?

Cunningham-South has been linked with a move to Sale Sharks, and given Alex Dombrandt is captain of Quins and their regular starting number eight, you wonder if a move could increase his opportunities in the back row.

Immanuel Feyi-Waboso impressed against Ireland in last year's Six Nations

Exeter Chiefs wing Feyi-Waboso broke into the England team last year and scored in two Tests against New Zealand.

The 22-year-old continued on the right wing last autumn and again scored against the All Blacks, but injuries have stunted his progress since.

Feyi-Waboso, who missed this year's Six Nations after shoulder surgery, only played four games of club rugby following his two appearances in last autumn's internationals.

A red card playing against France A then resulted in suspension for both Tests against Argentina.

Borthwick still brought Feyi-Waboso on the summer tour and played him in the final game against the United States, but his unavailability opened the door to competition with Tom Roebuck taking his opportunity.

From starting the year as a genuine British and Irish Lions contender, it ended up being a frustrating campaign.

However, Feyi-Waboso is a gifted athlete and has the ability to break a game open on his own, with his recovery defence also a point of difference.

Having scored seven Prem tries in the opening five rounds, he is certainly back up to speed and in pole position for a wing spot.

Henry Arundell's last cap for England came against Argentina in the 2023 Rugby World Cup bronze-medal match

Bath wing Arundell burst on to the international scene with a try against Australia as a 19-year-old.

The demise of London Irish, where he scored a viral length-of-the-pitch solo try, meant Arundell moved to Racing 92 after the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

Five tries against Chile at the World Cup had supporters frustrated that he paused his international career to play in the Top 14.

Arundell, who has been criticised for his ability under the high ball and defence, said he wanted to develop his game and come back a better player.

Now at Bath, Arundell has demonstrated his sharp footwork and kept the ball alive in tight areas - and four tries in five Prem games indicates he is on the right track.

Added to his exceptional pace and sharp finishing skills, is he now more well-rounded to fit in on the wing for England?

Another lengthy eye-catching solo try came for England Under-20s at full-back, a position he has not played much since his time at London Irish, but could be another way of enhancing his Test chances.

Here’s what you need to know: "I was so anxious, to the point where my hands and body were shaking. I wanted to park up and just not drive any more."

Learner driver Teddy is recounting her fear at being tailgated by another driver mid-lesson.

"They followed us, getting up close - shining their lights, even though it was daytime," the 22-year-old tells BBC Morning Live.

Getting behind the wheel is a rite of passage for many, but for fledgling drivers like Teddy, it's a challenge that's increasingly being made harder by abuse and intimidation from fellow road users and members of the public.

In the UK, all learners must have L plates at the front and rear of their vehicle - so other road users know they are inexperienced. In Wales, D plates are also accepted.

Teddy's ordeal only stopped when the driver pulled up to a shop, but the experience knocked her confidence.

Yet, rather than give up, Teddy has chosen to keep going. Determined to persevere, she's recently restarted lessons.

Morning Live returns on Monday at 0930am. Watch it here.

This kind of resilience is necessary for many learning to drive. The average waiting time for a driving test is currently just under six months.

Teddy's instructor Debbie says her learners are abused on an almost daily basis.

"I'd consider it a good day if I go home and don't recollect any kind of aggressive behaviour towards the learner driver sat next to me," she says.

In a bid to fight back against the intimidation, instructors like Debbie are increasingly installing dashcams to catch instances of abuse.

This footage can be vital in securing evidence as inconsiderate driving is an offence - whether it's flashing your headlights, beeping your horn, tailgating or shouting.

Over the last five years police forces across the UK have received over 170,000 dashcam clips, according to the National Dashcam Safety Portal. Around 7 out of 10 of those have led to action being taken. 

And it's not just learner drivers who fall victim to abuse, some cases see instructors made the target. 

Sonya, from Cheshire, was physically assaulted by another road user last year, when she was taking a pupil on their very first lesson. 

The learner temporarily blocked a drive, just as the homeowner returned. Ignoring Sonya's apology, a passenger got out, pulled open her door, and pushed the seatbelt against her neck. The man later threatened to smash the car up with a hammer.

Sonya managed to compose herself and finish the lesson, but says she broke down once home.

"It was a shock," she says. "I did have more lessons planned that day, but I couldn't do it. I was shaken up."

After the incident Sonya bought a new car with doors that lock automatically, and she's now installed dashcams. The man who attacked her was charged and fined £565.

PC Richard Woodward, a traffic officer with Cheshire Police for 19 years, says impatience from other road users towards learner drivers and their instructors is growing.

He says the police have a number of powers for dealing with aggressive driving and related threatening behaviour.

This includes Section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002. On first offence, this allows a warning to be given that stays on an individual's record for the next 12 months.

But commit a second similar offence within the year and police have the ability to impound, or take away, vehicles.

"And if you do get a driving without due care or inconsiderate driving conviction," says PC Woodward, "typically, insurance companies put your policy up by about 40% each year."

Looking ahead, beyond simple fear of the law, Debbie urges people to have more empathy and be kinder on the roads.

"Just think about how you felt when it was you [learning to drive]," she says.

"And if you can't remember that, then just think about how you would feel if a driver was intimidating someone you loved."

Speaking on behalf of learner drivers, Teddy adds: "Don't tailgate. Just give us a bit of room."

1. Stay calm. It is natural to feel pressured. The person behind may not realise they are adding additional pressure. 

2. Maintain your vision. Keep your eyes on the road and continue to focus looking for potential hazards around you. 

3. Don't speed up. It can be tempting to go faster to "get out of the way", but this can be dangerous. Maintain a safe and legal speed.

4. Create space ahead. If possible, increase the gap between you and the vehicle in front. This gives you more time to react and reduces the risk of a collision.

5. Let them pass safely. If there is space and it is allowed, consider moving over when it's appropriate to enable them to pass. Do not pull over suddenly or stop in an unsafe place.

6. Tailgating happens to most drivers at some point. Experiencing it as a learner, with the support of your driving instructor or supervising driver, is an important learning moment. Once the situation has passed, discuss the experience and how you could handle similar situations in the future.

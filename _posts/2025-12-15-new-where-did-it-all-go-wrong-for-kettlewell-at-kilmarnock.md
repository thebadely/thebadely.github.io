Here’s what you need to know: Stuart Kettlewell has been sacked by Kilmarnock following a run of 10 games without a victory

After six months, 21 days and 23 games, Stuart Kettlewell's Kilmarnock tenure is over.

The former Motherwell boss has been sacked from his position at Rugby Park, along with assistant coach Stevie Frail, following a 10-game winless run.

Sunday's late defeat at Aberdeen proved the end for the 41-year-old, who leaves with the Ayrshire side in the Scottish Premiership's relegation play-off spot.

Kettlewell felt hard done by about the nature of that loss, but the issues under the former Ross County manger run deeper than the Dons' controversial winning goal.

Kettlewell resigned from his role at Motherwell in January, citing personal abuse he had received from fans during a downturn in form.

In a similar vein to this campaign, he oversaw an encouraging start at Fir Park last term before standing down following a run of one win in nine.

There is also symmetry in the turnover of players he had to manage over the summer, plus injury issues, which were a regular theme during his time in Lanarkshire.

Despite the alarming form he was enduring at the end of his Motherwell tenure, it was often the level of performance that attracted most of the criticism.

People tend to forget his side were the third highest scorers in the Premiership in the 2023-24 season, when they finished ninth in the league.

However, he opted to alter his approach in the summer of 2024 to a more passive, counter-attacking style, which only brought more scrutiny when results did not come.

The same sort of questions that were being asked of the manager last year were being repeated by a different fan base 12 months on.

Although the same outcome has been reached, with Kettlewell departing, the process to get there has changed as this time his bosses have triggered his exit.

Having picked up just two points from the past 30 available to them, Kilmarnock are in relegation form.

In fact, in Kettlewell's past 25 Premiership matches as a manager, he has won just three of them.

Kilmarnock have been in freefall since a 3-0 home defeat to Hearts in October. That loss started a wretched run of eight defeats and two draws in 10 games.

With bottom-side Livingston - who have a game in hand - just three points behind, the threat is clear.

But what do the underlying numbers say about Kilmarnock?

No team in the league has a lower average possession (38%) than the Ayrshire side, which tells you they struggle to control games.

Of course, possession isn't everything, but if you are going to need to defend for more than 60% of the time in your matches, you had best not have the worst defensive record in the division.

No side has shipped more goals than Kilmarnock's tally of 32, while going the other way their scoring rate of one per game is verging on a league low. That is a recipe for relegation.

Three clean sheets from 17 matches is also troubling, as is the fact their expected goals conceded tally is the highest in the league.

Kettlewell was frustrated after Sunday's defeat to Aberdeen as Killie had a penalty taken off them by VAR following a hand ball and then one awarded against them for hand ball.

"Everyone will point to the bad run, but people have no idea how much these huge decisions have a bearing on people's careers, their jobs," he said post match.

In the previous game he lamented "big decisions" going against them in a defeat by Rangers which saw him sent off. 

Now, it will be down to former Partick Thistle boss Kris Doolan, who has been placed in caretaker charge, to improve those numbers in the interim as a weekend visit from Falkirk looms.

Following that, a confidence-stricken squad face back-to-back trips to League Cup winners St Mirren and fellow strugglers Dundee before welcoming Hibernian.

Adam: It's sad to see people lose their jobs, but I wish them all the very best in any new venture. Now who do you think can get us out of this mess with the same squad of players? Maybe an ex-Killie man. Steven Naismith or even Gary Holt, someone with a bit of Killie passion.

Mick: I'd be really surprised if the club aren't talking to Tony Docherty by now. He did well at Killie before [as assistant coach] and knows the club. He was unfairly sacked at Dundee in my view and is available at no cost [after being sacked by Ross County]. Seems like a no-brainer to me.

Craig: Thankfully Kettlewell's time at Killie is over. It was a failure from top to bottom with consistent terrible performances and a real lack of development for any of our youth. As for his replacement I'd like us to look for a foreign manager with a new style like Motherwell have recently done.

Gary: The board need to get it right this time. They have failed multiple times in the past to get the right man in. After Steve Clarke, their decisions on who was the right man got us relegated and again this season their right man, who 90% of Killie fans never wanted for the job, has us heading to the Championship. Get it wrong again and it's the board that should be packing their bags.

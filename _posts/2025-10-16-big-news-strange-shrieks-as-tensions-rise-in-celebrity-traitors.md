Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the fourth episode of The Celebrity Traitors

The latest episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and all we're talking about is which celebrity can shriek the best.

During a challenge, the contestants - including Alan Carr, Celia Imrie and Lucy Beaumont - were tasked with asking a group of banshees to sing, before relaying the songs down a well.

It was weird, and off-the-wall. But for many social media users, it was the subtitles that stole the show.

"Celia shrieks strangely," read one, while another said: "They repeat the wail."

"The people responsible for the subtitles deserve a raise," wrote one X user.

Singer Charlotte Church was, unsurprisingly, the most impressive. Meanwhile, Imrie's efforts - and facial expressions - won her more love online, with one calling her "the funniest person to have ever existed".

There was also a rare moment where presenter Claudia Winkleman's mask appeared to slip, as national treasure Sir Stephen Fry plunged his head into the well.

"Oh no, Stephen Fry is in the water, I can't look" she said, covering her eyes.

"I'm a grown man, what the hell am I doing," said Sir Stephen after he emerged, in a quote that could sum up the entire series.

Elsewhere, the celebrities' continued inability to pick out a Traitor was the other big talking point of the night.

"They're hopeless, absolutely hopeless," said TV critic Toby Earle.

TV sports presenter Clare Balding became the latest celebrity to be banished from the castle.

The 54-year-old received seven votes from her fellow contestants during Thursday's episode, before revealing she was in fact a faithful.

"What are the odds of us being so useless," said Sir Stephen, while Winkleman urged the celebrities to do better. "Stop being so polite," she told them.

Other faithfuls - YouTube star Niko Omilana, and actress Tameka Empson - were both already voted out at previous roundtables.

Earlier in the episode, another of the younger celebrities - actress Ruth Codd, 29 - was murdered by the traitors.

Codd had won fans with her cutting one-liners, and there was sadness on social media to see her go. "Icon down," wrote one X user.

Her murder comes after she raised her suspicions about TV presenter Jonathan Ross being a traitor during Wednesday's episode.

Fellow traitor Cat Burns warned that "it could backfire on you" to remove his prime suspect, but Ross replied: "Look, if I was a traitor, I wouldn't have done that."

The words "double bluff" and "double double bluff" were bandied around throughout the episode - but in the end, Ross survived to tell the tale.

"How am I still here. I've got to be the luckiest traitor in the history of the game," Ross wondered.

Other highlights from the show included Ross's leopard cardigan, which Balding likened to a "Flintstones outfit".

Meanwhile, comedian Alan Carr continues his transformation from giggly liability to cold-hearted killer.

"Let's get rid of her now before she poisons everyone," he declared about poor Codd.

Lucy Beaumont wondered whether her height may be a disadvantage. Sir Stephen is "too tall" for her to see his eyes and suss out his motives, she says - although she can tell you if his flies are undone.

And finally, Fartgate hasn't gone away. At one point, the celebrities were playing badminton, and Carr shouted out to Imrie: "Celia, we need a bit of wind to get it over the net."

She replied: "Oh, shut up."

The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.

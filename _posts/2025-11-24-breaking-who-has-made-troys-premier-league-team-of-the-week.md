It has been recently reported that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Alphonse Areola (West Ham): West Ham could have been six goals down at Bournemouth if it wasn't for him. Massive moment, stepped up and showed some quality. Some top goalkeeping to earn them a 2-2 draw. Defeat could have dismantled their whole season.

Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): He's up there for player of the season. People will talk about Arsenal players. He's been the top performer by a country mile.

Murillo (Nottingham Forest): You'd have been a crazy Forest fan to say 'Murillo will score and we'll beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield'. You'd have got massive odds on that. He was excellent. He's becoming a powerhouse. He can really be a handful. I'm happy to see him playing like last season.

Malick Thiaw (Newcastle): I watched him a few times last year in Italy for AC Milan and he was getting killled because he was making mistakes. But at Newcastle he's been a monster. He's been really strong and powerful and looks elegant. It looks like he's found a spiritual home.

Ferdi Kadioglu (Brighton): Not naturally a left-back, more of a modern type going forward. He's been a wonderful signing for Brighton. Who would be surprised at them finding another gem out of nowhere? I thought when they got rid of Pervis Estupinan that was strange but Brighton know more than us.

Sander Berge (Fulham) and Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest): Two of the same type of player and they're in for the same reason. Their teams won, everyone will talk about the goalscorers, but without these two those teams don't click. They are so good. They break up play, they attack together. 

Eberechi Eze (Arsenal): The man of the moment. Many Arsenal fansc, including my son, were questioning whether he was the man to get them over the top. Three goals in the north London derby and now they want to make a statue of him. Goals, composure, he ran the show. The best player on the pitch.

Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Maybe this is the only thing that I agree with Thomas Tuchel on - he has got to a point now where it's going to be very difficult to drop Morgan Rogers. 

I didn't think he had a great start to the season, I think he was a little bit entitled and thought he maybe could have got a move to Chelsea, and probably wanted that, but he seems to have settled down. Two great goals obviously against Leeds dragged his team from behind. He was the difference maker.

Callum Wilson (West Ham): I said he doesn't look his normal self. He looked like he'd lost a yard. But wow. That's all I can say. He was excellent. Phenomenal in his approach and with his two finishes.

Harvey Barnes (Newcastle): A really interesting player. He plays well, usually better off the bench, but Anthony Gordon has an injury so he has to play. He missed a huge chance against Manchester City at 0-0 with his easiest shot. But to have the mental fortitude to put himself in difficult situations and score twice was great.

Sean Dyche (Nottingham Forest): He comes in and outperforms Arne Slot. A wonderful gameplan. It could have been five or six for Forest and nobody could have argued.

Experts revealed that Cliftonville will be at home to north Belfast rivals Crusaders while Linfield host Glentoran in the 'Big Two' derby on Boxing Day

Three points on Boxing Day is a gift that all Irish League fans will have top of their Christmas lists.

With tough battles at the top and bottom of the table, it is set to be an exciting full round of fixtures for what has become one of the most anticipated days of the Irish Premiership calendar.

Supporters can keep up to date with all the action on the BBC Sport website via live text updates, as well as radio commentary on the Sportsound programme on BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Sounds from 14:00 GMT.

Before the big day, BBC Sport NI takes a look at all six of the Christmas crackers.

At Taylors Avenue, Carrick host Larne, who sit top of the Irish Premiership at Christmas.

After 19 years on the red and black side of the rivalry in north Belfast, this is former Crusaders boss Stephen Baxter's second year in charge of Carrick for the east Antrim derby.

Last season, at Inver Park, it ended 0-0 and Baxter is eagerly anticipating what he called his "highlight of the year".

"If you asked any of the players and managers, it is the game they look forward to. For me, it's the highlight of the year, the Boxing Day derbies," Baxter said.

League leaders Larne are unbeaten in their last 10 Irish Premiership games and have registered clean sheets in their past three matches. However, manager Gary Haveron is not underestimating the task ahead in the derby.

"Really difficult place to go, always has been, Taylors Avenue. The pitch will play a part, but they are a hard team to play against, and Stephen will have them well drilled for the game," Haveron said.

Two sides in very different form meet at Solitude with Cliftonville unbeaten in their past eight league games while the visitors, Crusaders, are without a win in six.

Two goals from Kieran Offord, who has since moved on to Linfield, secured the three points for the Crues in last year's fixture and they will be hoping fellow Scot and the league's top goalscorer Fraser Bryden will be able to repeat the feat this year.

"It's important we keep that momentum going. Boxing Day is always a big game, and everyone looks forward to it. It should be a bumper crowd," Cliftonville manager Jim Magilton said.

Crusaders fans will be hoping Santa brings them some much-needed points and the return of a number of key players to help Declan Caddell's side shift from 11th place in the table.

"The boys will be buzzing," said Crusaders assistant manager David Rainey.

"We will go up there with a positive frame of mind and hopefully get the same desire, hunger and commitment levels as against Larne [a 1-0 defeat on Saturday], but a better result."

It has been a difficult season for Glenavon so far but, since Michael O'Connor has taken over, results have improved.

The Lurgan Blues will come into the game at Shamrock Park with confidence after beating defending champions Linfield 2-1 in their previous game.

Portadown, meanwhile, will be aiming to get back to winning ways after a 4-2 defeat against Dungannon Swifts last weekend.

Last season, it was a feisty encounter with Glenavon winning 2-0 and the Ports having stopper Aaron McCarey dismissed.

Since then, the sides drew in the final derby of last campaign and Portadown were the 3-1 victors earlier this season.

After last year's 'Big Two' derby ended goalless at the Oval, it is now Linfield's turn to host the Boxing Day match.

The Blues suffered a shock defeat against Glenavon last weekend but will aim to preserve their 39-year-long Boxing Day unbeaten home record against Glentoran.

The Glens had a turbulent November but, after Friday's late win over Coleraine, are in fourth place, 11 points behind leaders Larne but with a game in hand.

"The fixture itself is mouth-watering," Glentoran boss Declan Devine said.

"To go to Windsor, take on the Blues and to [be] two teams pushing hard at the top, it's fantastic."

Matthew Shevlin has scored 99 goals for Coleraine 

Preparations for the derby have been far from ideal for Coleraine with midfielder Dylan Boyle, manager Ruaidhri Higgins and assistant manager Kevin Deery all suspended after being dismissed in their 2-1 defeat against Glentoran at the Oval.

The Bannsiders are unbeaten in their last four derbies, though, and won 3-1 in the meeting between the two sides at the Coleraine Showgrounds earlier in the season.

Oran Kearney will face his old side for the first time as Sky Blues boss and will be aiming to claim the bragging rights.

Ballymena's last Boxing Day victory was in 2023 at home in a game which proved to be Kearney's final derby as Coleraine manager.

With 53 miles between the two grounds, Dungannon Swifts v Bangor isn't the typical Boxing Day derby.

However, Bangor manager Lee Feeney said he is looking forward to the "new experience" as the Seasiders compete in their first Premiership festive fixture since 2008.

"I'm looking forward to it. A lot of our supporters haven't been there in a long, long time, if ever, so it's a new experience," Feeney added.

Last season's Irish Cup winners Dungannon are in good form after a challenging start to the season and will be aiming to make it four games unbeaten when they face Feeney's side. 

"We are delighted to be at home on Boxing Day and hopefully we have a good turn out," Dungannon's assistant manager Dixie Robinson commented.

"Bangor are a really tough opposition and they are going well, so hopefully the boys look after themselves well over the Christmas period."

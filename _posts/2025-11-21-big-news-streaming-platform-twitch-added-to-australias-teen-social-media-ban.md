Here’s what you need to know: Twitch, a streaming platform popular with gamers, has been added to Australia's  teen social media ban that starts next month.

It joins other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat that must ensure under-16s cannot open accounts and that existing ones are closed from 10 December.

Australia's internet regulator overseeing the ban said Twitch - owned by Amazon -had been included as its main purpose was "online social interaction" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content.

A Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December and that from 9 January existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated.

On her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was "a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted".

No more platforms are expected to be added to the ban before the start date next month, Ms Inman Grant said. 

The government has previously said the ban was aimed at reducing the "pressures and risks" children can be exposed to on social media, including harmful content.

Founded in 2007, Twitch is a popular livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.

Last year, it launched plans to share more of its revenue with creators as part of a shake-up, allowing streamers to make money through fans subscribing to their channel.

The revenue is split equally between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.

Twitch's policy forbids anyone under 13 to use its platform, and users aged between 13 and the legal age of adulthood in their country can only join if they have permission from their parent or guardian.

Ms Inman Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest, on which users can compile online notice boards of images, would not be included in the ban because its core purpose was not about online social interaction.

Instead, the platform was "more commonly used by individuals collating images for inspiration and idea curation", she said.

Australia's world-first under-16s social media ban also includes YouTube, Reddit, Kick, Threads and X.

The ban means tech companies must take "reasonable steps" to stop under-16s from using their platforms or risk being fined up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m).

Earlier this week, Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - announced it would start closing accounts of teenagers under 16 from 4 December, a week before the official ban. 

It's not clear how companies will enforce the ban but some possibilities included the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.

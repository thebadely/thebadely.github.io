Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Thomas Frank previously coached in his native Denmark before joining Brentford

Tottenham have appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their head coach on a deal until 2028.

The 51-year-old Dane replaces Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked earlier this month despite leading Spurs to victory in the Europa League final in May. 

Frank spent seven years in charge of Brentford, guiding the club from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021. 

He is Tottenham's fourth permanent manager since June 2021.

Spurs finished 17th in the top flight last season, losing 22 of their 38 matches and finishing seven places and 18 points below Brentford. 

However, they have qualified for next season's Champions League after beating Manchester United in the Europa League final in Bilbao - their first major trophy for 17 years.

Justin Cochrane will join Frank at Tottenham as the Dane's assistant, despite efforts from the Bees to keep hold of the England coach. 

Frank has also brought head of performance Chris Haslam and first-team analyst Joe Newton with him from Brentford, while another assistant coach, Andreas Georgson, arrives from Manchester United.

In a statement,, external Brentford said everyone connected with the club "would like to thank Thomas for the incredible impact he has had on the club's history".

Bees director of football Phil Giles said: "From the moment he replaced Dean Smith, he understood what we were trying to build and his wisdom, coaching ability and emotional intelligence have helped transform the club.

"But it's not just what you see on the pitch. He forged a special connection with our fans, helped develop and improve players, and was instrumental in implementing the culture that has seen Brentford go from strength to strength.

"We will never forget Thomas, but now it is time to thank him and take the next steps in our journey with a new leader who we believe can be just as successful and influential."

An hour after the appointment of Frank was confirmed, Spurs captain Cristian Romero posted a message, external to his former boss Postecoglou.

It included the line: "You paved the way despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist," which some supporters have viewed as a shot at Spurs owner Daniel Levy, who chose to sack Postecoglou despite winning the Europa League.

Frank first joined Brentford as an assistant in 2016, before taking over from Dean Smith as head coach in October 2018.

In 2019-20 his side reached the Championship play-off final but suffered a 2-1 defeat by Fulham.

They reached the Championship play-off again the following season and beat Swansea City to reach the Premier League, with Frank becoming the first Brentford manager in 86 years to win promotion to the top flight.

Since then, Frank has established the Bees as a competitive Premier League club, recording 13th, ninth, 16th and 10th-place finishes.

Last season Brentford's tally of 66 goals in the Premier League was the joint fifth best in the division.

Of the 152 top-flight games Frank has overseen, he has won 54 and lost 60 - claiming 200 points from a possible 456.

Postecoglou's style of play at Spurs proved divisive, with a notoriously high line featuring prominently before being ditched for the crucial Europa League run-in.

Frank is known for his use of data in the game, previously stating he is not a lover of shots from outside the box.

Last season, 23% of Brentford's efforts came from outside the area - the lowest in the league - compared to 28% for Spurs.

Last season Brentford attempted 675 crosses, while Spurs delivered 752. Frank may bring with him the need to be more picky in wide areas.

A statistic that stands out is his side's willingness to compete in the air, with last season's 1,210 aerial duels the highest figure in the league and dwarfing Tottenham's 872.

Expect Tottenham to contest things that bit more but, as with shots from range or crosses, Frank seems to want to be smart when it comes to competing.

Brentford fouled far less than Spurs across the past two seasons - indeed, only Manchester City committed fewer fouls than Brentford last season.

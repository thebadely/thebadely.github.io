Experts revealed that Danni Wyatt-Hodge is England's all-time leading run-scorer in T20 internationals and has seen women's cricket's profile grow at a time the Lionesses have enjoyed success in women's football

When Danni Wyatt-Hodge visits her local supermarket she is greeted by the familiar faces of the Lionesses at almost every turn.

The England batter is looking to add another trophy to her ever-growing collection at the inaugural women's T20 Blast finals day at The Oval on Sunday.

But she will also be firmly behind Leah Williamson, Chloe Kelly and co when they face Spain in Sunday's Euro 2025 final because she knows what another triumph would mean for women's sport in England and the growth of cricket within that.

"I said to my wife this is going to be huge if the Lionesses win the Euros again. It's going to be so good for women's football and for women's sport because it gets everyone talking about it again," Wyatt-Hodge, 34, told BBC Sport.

"You go into supermarkets now and all over the shelves you see the Lionesses. I hope one day it's the England cricket girls.

"It's going to be amazing if they can get that win on Sunday and women's sport is going to keep on going up and up."

Chloe Kelly scored a dramatic late extra-time winner against Italy to send England through to a second consecutive Euros final

Wyatt-Hodge has watched intently from home as the Lionesses have battled their way to a second consecutive Euros final.

They will be out for revenge against Spain, who emerged victorious when the two teams met in the World Cup final two years ago.

Wyatt-Hodge said women's sport had "gone through the roof" since England's victory over Germany in the Euro 2022 final on home soil at Wembley.

Now England's all-time leading T20 run-scorer is hoping her side can emulate that success when England and Wales host the Women's T20 World Cup next year, and inspire the next generation of female players.

"It's going to be massive for us if we can win the home World Cup next summer," she said.

"When I first started playing cricket there was no women's cricket where I lived. I was the only girl playing in Stoke-on-Trent and now we've got a whole league, which is amazing. I just hope girls know schools where they can play in their area.

"The more that we're on TV, and we're winning and performing then we'll be inspiring the next generation and that's going to be massive."

Wyatt-Hodge is already a World Cup winner with England and has played in the Big Bash League in Australia, as well as in packed stadiums at the Women's Premier League in India.

She represents Southern Brave in the Hundred and has enjoyed a stellar first season with Surrey, having signed a new contract earlier this month.

Her side go into Sunday's finals day as favourites, taking their place directly in the final after topping the group stage by 10 points.

They will face the winner of The Blaze and Bears Women, who face each other in the semi-final, and Wyatt-Hodge is keen to finish the job on home turf.

"It's an honour to play for Surrey and I just really hope we get the job done after a really successful campaign, everyone has turned up at some point at the tournament and that shows the squad depth," she said.

"It's been amazing to play in the double-headers with the boys at some of the best grounds in the country.

"For me, playing at The Oval as a batter is a dream. It's so flat and the outfield is so quick.

"The standard of cricket has been so good. I've been around for a long time now and I've seen the standard of women's cricket go through the roof, which is amazing."

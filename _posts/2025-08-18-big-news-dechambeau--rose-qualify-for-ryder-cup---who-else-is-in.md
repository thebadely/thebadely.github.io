Let's dive into the details: Bryson DeChambeau qualified thanks to three top-10 finishes in this year's majors

Both the European and American Ryder Cup teams are beginning to take shape with the 45th staging of the biennial contest being held from 26-28 September at Bethpage Black in New York.

All six of the US automatic qualifiers are known. Bryson DeChambeau, Russell Henley and Harris English were all confirmed on Sunday, to join Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and JJ Spaun in a team that will be bolstered to 12 by captain Keegan Bradley's wildcard picks.

Europe's qualification process concludes after this week's Betfred British Masters at the Belfry with just one automatic spot up for grabs.

Ireland's Shane Lowry occupies the sixth and final place but Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard will take it should he finish joint 29th or better.

Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose and Tyrrell Hatton are the five other confirmed names, with captain Luke Donald set to announce his six picks on 1 September.

McIntyre confirmed his spot by finishing runner-up to Scheffler at last week's BMW Championship, the final qualifying event for American players. The world number eight was second at June's US Open and seventh at last month's Open.

"Bob has put in some big performances on both sides of the Atlantic this season, and that fine form combined with his experience from 2023 will be invaluable in New York," said Donald of the Scot who contributed 2Â½ points from three matches in Rome.

Spain's Jon Rahm, who on Sunday won the LIV Golf individual title for a second successive year, looks nailed on for a wildcard spot, while Sweden's Ludvig Aberg and Norwegian Viktor Hovland are also likely to be in the 12-strong team.

Two Englishmen in Harry Hall and Marco Penge are among those in with a chance of making their Ryder Cup debuts. 

Hall, who is 15th in the standings, has impressed on the PGA Tour, with five top-10s and he finished sixth at last week's BMW Championship to qualify for this week's season-ending Tour Championship. He has racked up 409 birdies this year, 45 more than any other player.

Penge climbed to 14th in the standings by beating Rasmus Hojgaard by one stroke to claim the DP World Tour's Danish Golf Championship on Sunday, his second title of the season.

The six American qualifiers were confirmed following the conclusion of the last qualifying event, the BMW Championship.

World number one Scheffler won the US PGA Championship and Open to qualify with ease, also added the BMW Championship title on Sunday.

JJ Spaun, who won the US Open to claim his first major, after being beaten to the Players Championship title in a play-off by McIlroy, was also already qualified.

As was Schauffele, who won the US PGA and Open in 2024. He has had a quieter 2025, although he extended his run of not missing a cut to 58 events - the longest since Tiger Woods set the record at 142. However, he has not qualified for this week's season-ending 30-man Tour Championship.

English and Henley rubber-stamped their spots over the weekend, while DeChambeau, who plays on the LIV Golf circuit, qualified thanks to six top-10 finishes in the majors during the 17-month qualification period.

Captain Bradley will announce his six captain's picks to complete the 12-man team on 27 August.

There is a chance that Bradley, 39, could pick himself to play after he finished in a tie for 17th at the BMW Championship, to cement 10th place in the US Ryder Cup standings.

Arnold Palmer was the Ryder Cup's last playing captain, when he led the US team, aged 34, in 1963.

Major champions Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa were among those to miss out on automatic qualification for the US team.

Ben Griffin, Maverick McNealy and Andrew Novak are the other three Americans in the top-12, but none have appeared at a Ryder Cup before and Bradley may opt for the experience of Patrick Cantlay, who is 15th on the list but has picked up 5Â½ points in two previous appearances.

Europe, who won 16Â½-11Â½ in Rome in 2023, are looking to become the first away side to win since they triumphed at Medinah in 2012.

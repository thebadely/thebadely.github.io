According to new developments, Neil Callan celebrates victory on No Half Measures

No Half Measures caused a shock at Newmarket as the 66-1 outsider won the July Cup under jockey Neil Callan.

Trained by former jockey Richard Hughes, No Half Measures edged past Big Mojo on the line to win the 145th edition of the Group One sprint.

Run To Freedom finished third, a further length and three-quarters back, with Believing in fourth and favourite Notable Speech fifth.

"Over the last couple of years I felt I was a bit buried," Callan told ITV Racing.

"Last year was a bit of a struggle and this year's been a bit of a struggle, but you just wait for that one horse.

"I was open-minded as an outsider but he [Hughes] always believed she could run the race because she has good stats and performances over six. 

"It's a surreal moment."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Thousands of people are still without power and trains remain suspended in the aftermath of Storm Floris.

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it was continuing to restore supplies after about 50,000 homes were left without power.

Network Rail said teams had been working "tirelessly" to clear routes with 119 incidents reported on train lines across Scotland on Monday, amid gusts of up to 90mph in some parts.

Cancelled trains and flights caused widespread disruption across the UK on Monday, with early reports from aviation analytics firm Cirium suggesting that at least 68 departure flights were cancelled as a result of the storm. 

SSEN said Floris was "the most damaging summer storm in recent memory" with thousands of properties hit in the Highlands, Moray and Aberdeenshire.

The Met Office has warned that a further period of unseasonable wet and windy weather is on the way late on Wednesday and into Thursday for those in north-western parts of the UK.

The Scottish government held an emergency meeting on Monday night in response to the "significant disruption" caused by the storm.

Home Affairs Secretary Angela Constance said travel should be avoided if possible until the danger had passed.  

She said that power cuts were still affecting a "significant" number of properties, and that the recovery period would take time despite an improving forecast over the rest of the week. 

"We will continue to receive updates throughout Tuesday and will have a better idea on public transport tomorrow morning," she added.

ScotRail urged customers to check their journey via the app, website or JourneyCheck before travelling on Tuesday.

About 9,000 homes in Scotland had been reconnected by Monday night, with SSEN engineers working to restore power to 43,500 more.

The firm said free hot food and drinks would be provided on Tuesday in areas where homes were awaiting reconnection.

Confirmed food locations are:

Network Rail reported 75 tree-related incidents across the network, including trees falling on to overhead lines at King's Park in Glasgow, Cornton near Stirling and Bishopton near Paisley. 

It said some train disruption would continue as checks were carried out on Tuesday morning.

Ross Moran, Network Rail Scotland's route director, said: "Storm Floris has caused significant disruption to Scotland's railway.

"As the storm passes our focus switches to inspecting routes which have been closed by fallen trees, debris and other damage.

"We'll use two helicopters to assist engineers on the ground. We're grateful to passengers for their patience whilst we do this."

Flights and ferries were also suspended across Scotland on Monday with people urged to avoid travel.

Most of the country's major road bridges were closed to high-sided vehicles.

Vehicles were blown over in Glasgow and Skye, while the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and other major events were cancelled.

Edinburgh Fringe Festival said about 110 shows had been cancelled - mostly those in temporary structures.

In Glasgow, location filming for the superhero blockbuster Spider-Man: Brand New Day was suspended in the city centre.

The SQA also warned that the weather would delay the delivery of exam results letters on Tuesday for pupils on Scotland's islands.

A Met Office amber warning, covering a wide area from the central belt to the Highlands, expired at 23:00 on Monday.

Western coastal areas saw the strongest early gusts with the high winds moving north-east later.

The Met Office said summer storms caused problems as trees were in full leaf and were more likely to be toppled with branches broken off.

Tuesday is forecast to be a calmer day as Storm Floris moves towards Scandinavia.

Scorecard. Table

Oval Invincibles effectively sealed their place in Sunday's men's Hundred final by easing to a six-wicket victory over London Spirit at The Oval.

Invincibles are four points clear at the top of the table and, although Northern Superchargers and Trent Rockets can join them on 24 points with wins on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, the two-time defending champions' net run-rate advantage is such that it is highly improbable for them to be overtaken.

They therefore avoid Saturday's eliminator, which is set to be contested between Superchargers and Rockets.

Invincibles secured the win by making light work of a chase of 153 with batter Jordan Cox continuing his fine form.

The right-hander came in after Tawanda Muyeye was caught for a first-ball duck and confidently struck 47 from 27 balls to extend his advantage at the top of the run-scoring list. 

He was bowled attempting a reverse sweep to Jamie Overton but at that stage only 26 runs were needed and his side won with 22 balls to spare. 

The hosts were not at their best with the ball but still limited their London rivals to 152-7.

Though they were beaten by Superchargers at Headingley on Saturday, they will be favourites whoever they face on Sunday.

Invincibles appear to have every base covered as they hunt a third successive title.

As well as Cox, who brutally flogged anything short over the leg side, opener Will Jacks also hit three sixes in a 27-ball 45.

After both fell, powerful finisher Donovan Ferreira crashed 24 from just nine balls to emphatically seal the win.

While Cox is 63 runs clear at the top of the run-scoring chart, Ferreira has the tournament's best strike-rate.

Batting is their stronger suit, but the variety of their pace attack always gives skipper Sam Billings options.

Leg-spinner Nathan Sowter has performed admirably as the sole spinner since Rashid Khan left for international duty with Afghanistan last week.

Here he took 2-23 after Jamie Smith gave Spirit a fast start with 28 from 15, helping squeeze the scoring before 31 from 18 by Overton boosted the score.

Sowter may well be joined by Australia spinner Adam Zampa for the final, with Invincibles in talks with the 33-year-old over a one-game deal. 

That would make their opponent's task tougher still.

Northern Superchargers host local rivals Manchester Originals on Sunday. 

In the women's match, Originals need a massive win to overhaul Spirit on net run-rate and keep their hopes of qualifying for the eliminator alive. 

Harry Brook's Superchargers then meet Jos Buttler's Originals, effectively looking to secure second place in the table.

Nicolas Raskin talks about his "difficult" start to the season

Rangers midfielder Nicolas Raskin feels he was unfairly portrayed earlier this season after falling out of favour under previous head coach Russell Martin.

Amid summer transfer speculation, the Belgium midfielder was dropped for key games as Rangers struggled, a situation that drew fierce criticism from supporters.

Raskin admits he had doubts about his future at the Scottish Premiership club but is now open to extending his contract, which has 18 months left to run.

"I think there's a picture that's been tried to be pinned on me at the time that wasn't what really was happening in the building," the 24-year-old said as he looked forward to Thursday's Europa League visit by Sporting Braga.

"I can't lie - it was really difficult for me that period. I'm still trying to get back to my best form, whether it's physically or mentally. It's not been great. I've not enjoyed every part of it. I've read a lot of wrong stuff. 

"I had to be quiet and just try and do my best to get back playing and to get back to helping the team. Now, I just look forward and try to improve."

Martin dropped Raskin from his squad for an Old Firm derby against Celtic - claiming the decision was backed by senior players - and accused the Belgian of having his head turned by transfer speculation.

"It was a point where it was tough and I had clear indication that my future was in doubt - it's in the past," Raskin, who joined Rangers from Standard Liege in 2023, said. 

"Now we're trying to build something new. I'm not someone who likes to be headlining the drama. 

"I'm just trying to do my job, help the team as much as I can and do my best for the club. Hopefully, we can win tomorrow, get our first three points."

With his contract running down in the summer of 2027, Raskin revealed that, if he was to leave the club, he would want Rangers to benefit.

"I'm very happy here," he explained. "We've got a new manager, we're trying to build something good. I'm not deciding anything. I'm just waiting for anyone to come and talk to me, trying to give my best for the club.

"If I have to leave, I want everybody to be happy and to leave in a good way. It doesn't depend on me right now. There's nothing on my side thinking I'm going to leave for free or anything. I don't want that, to be honest.

"The club has given me a lot, helped me to go to the national team and helped me to show myself on a good stage. So, if I can give back everything, I'll try to give back."

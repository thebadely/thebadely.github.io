Here’s what you need to know: Organisers of a Christmas toy appeal are urging people to donate to the project if they are able to, so they can give gifts to thousands of children living in extreme hardship in north and east London. 

The Hackney Local Buyers Club is running its 12th annual appeal, but fear donations will drop due to increased pressures on household budgets.

This year, the project aims to provide new gifts to children living in the boroughs of Hackney and Haringey, which are among the most deprived in England.

Organisers say the appeal also helps support independent businesses in the area, as any money donated will be spent with local traders.

The gifts are distributed by local councils, usually to children in care or those in temporary accommodation.

Jenna Fansa, co-founder of the Winter Toy Appeal said she originally set it up because it felt  unfair that some children did not get presents at Christmas due to living in poverty.

"It's a very special thing," she said.

"Since it started we've given out 37,000 gifts to children - typically 3-5,000 each year."

Ms Fansa said that since the appeal began, the community had "rallied around" to support it.

However, this year's appeal got off to a "slow start" she said.

"We've definitely noticed an impact on the appeal and the knock on effect of that is that we will reach fewer children, so we really do need people to give what they can".

Brand new craft sets, remote controlled cars, soft toys, lego are especially helpful, she said.

Co-founder Vicky Bibiris said they aimed to ensure no child goes without a new toy on Christmas morning.

"Just by purchasing a small toy ...you'll make a difference to a child that otherwise doesn't have that spark of joy the children experience at this time of year."

There are several ways to donate to the Winter Toy Appeal, which include:

The appeal organisers, The Local Buyers Club, is a membership group that encourages people to shop at local independent business with exclusive discounts and perks.

Money from GoFundMe donations will be spent with businesses that sign up to the club. These include Stoke Newington Toys & Books, the Toy Box Victoria Park, Soup Dragon in Crouch End and Know and Love in Stoke Newington.

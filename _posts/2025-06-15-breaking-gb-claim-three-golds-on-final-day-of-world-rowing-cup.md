According to new developments, Lauren Henry received an MBE for her services to rowing in the latest New Year Honours

Olympic champion Lauren Henry MBE was among the winners for Great Britain as they claimed three gold medals on the final day of the World Rowing Cup in Varese, Italy.

Henry was impressive in the women's single sculls, finishing more than eight seconds clear of Germany's Juliane Faralisch and China's Ruiqi Li, who took silver and bronze respectively.

"I'm really pleased with the race," said the 23-year-old, who was part of the successful quadruple sculls team in the Paris Games.

"I kept it lively, there's some bits that I still want to work on to see how I can push on, but there's certainly more to come.

"The single is a very physical race, but it's the same for everyone, so you just have to try and keep yourself as cool as you can."

Henry's gold was sandwiched between two more for Britain.

Both the men's and women's eights teams were victorious in their races, while the men's quadruple sculls team finished third behind hosts Italy and Poland to take bronze.

Sunday's results meant GB finish second in the medal table with three gold and two bronze medals, behind Netherlands who conclude with three golds, three silvers and two bronze.

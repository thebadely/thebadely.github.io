According to new developments, Sofiia Lyskun represented Ukraine at the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympics

The Ukrainian Diving Federation wants diver Sofiia Lyskun to be stripped of all awards after the European champion switched her international allegiance to Russia.

Lyskun, 23, who won the 10m synchro title at last year's European Aquatics Championships, chose to change her citizenship earlier this week.

The federation said Lyskun did not inform it, the coaching staff or Ukraine's ministry of youth and sports of her intention, and "expresses deep indignation and strongly condemns" her actions.

In a statement,, external the federation said: "Such steps are categorically unacceptable, as they discredit not only an individual athlete, but also the entire Ukrainian team, which selflessly fights every day for the right to represent our country on the international stage."

Lyskun told Russian newspaper Izvestia, external that over recent years she realised she was no longer "growing" under her coaches in Ukraine, who were "all gymnasts or trampoline athletes".

At an extraordinary meeting of the federation's executive committee, a unanimous decision was made to expel Lyskun immediately from the Ukraine team and to "strip her of all titles and awards received under the auspices of the federation".

It will also "appeal to international sports institutions with a demand to apply sports quarantine to the aforementioned athlete in accordance with current international standards".

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, athletes from Russia and Belarus were banned from competing in World Aquatics events.

Those restrictions have since been eased, with Russians and Belarusians allowed to compete individually as neutral athletes, without their national flag or symbols.

From January, they will also be able to participate as neutral athletes in team events.

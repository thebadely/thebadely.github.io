It has been recently reported that An MP has called for the owners of car company Lotus to "step up to the mark" and make the future of its factory clear to its 1,300 workers.

Reports emerged on Friday that China-based Geely was considering closing the company's Hethel site, amid uncertainty created in the industry by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

A statement from Lotus Cars on Saturday insisted it had "no plans to close any factory", but added that it was "actively exploring strategic options to enhance efficiency and ensure global competitiveness".

South Norfolk MP Ben Goldsborough was part of a meeting with Geely representatives on Monday and said he emphasised the need for "openness".

Goldsborough told the BBC: "Geely [has] made the statement that the site will remain in operation.

"But there is a big difference between 'remain in operation' and at what capacity.

"So today's conversation was all about how we secure capacity and as many, if not all, of the 1,300 jobs there."

The Labour MP, who was elected last summer, said he could not share full details due to the commercially sensitive nature of the discussions with the company.

He continued: "What I want them to do is to have the openness to say what their plans are going forward.

"It needs to be looking at the commercial aspect of it, the long-term sustainability of the site as well because, as I keep saying, the models that are produced there, the talent that the 1,300 workers have, is second to none.

"If you lose it, you lose it forever, and that's where Geely need to step up to the mark now."

Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds met with Geely on Sunday and said he "was reassured" that the firm has "no plans to close their Hethel plant".

Lotus was founded in the early 1950s by engineer Colin Chapman and moved to its Norfolk base at Hethel in the 1960s.

Geely, which also owns Volvo, took majority control in 2017 when purchasing a 49.9% stake in previous parent company Proton.

It has overseen the brand's continued transition towards electric and hybrid vehicles, with the Emira launched in 2021 as its last conventional petrol car.

However, the company announced plans in April to cut 270 jobs in the UK, which followed the loss of 94 jobs last November.

Goldsborough said: "We've seen the ups and downs of Lotus time and time again.

"Every time it sees challenge and adversity it finds new ways of reinventing itself and that's what we've got to do now. 

"We've got to give it that springboard to reinvent itself long-term."

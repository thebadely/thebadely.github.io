Watch Critchley's last interview as Hearts head coach

Neil Critchley was a surprise appointment to rescue Hearts' season. 

"Never a Hearts manager," according to Sportscene pundit and former Tynecastle player Michael Stewart. 

And so, after six months and 35 matches in all competitions, it's over. 

The Englishman, 46, extracted the Edinburgh side from relegation danger, but failed to reach the top six. 

And, after defeat by Dundee, the spectre of demotion through the play-offs has flitted back into view. It was that which ultimately led to Critchley being told on Saturday evening that his time was up.

BBC Sport's Scotland's Brian McLauchlin, who covers Hearts every week, picks through the debris and looks at what might happen now.

When Critchley was appointed in October, many Hearts fans had never heard of the former Liverpool youth coach.

Sure, he had managed Queens Park Rangers and Blackpool (on two separate occasions) but remained pretty much an unknown quantity.

Chief executive officer Andrew McKinlay refuted suggestions Critchley was the club's second choice because talks had broken down with former Norway boss Per-Mathias Hogmo.

And two wins in his opening games appeared to show the Hearts board - or data partner Jamestown Analytics, who were heavily involved in the decision - had identified the right man.

However, just three victories against the Premiership's bottom two teams in the next 14 matches followed.

Included in this run was a wretched performance against Moldovan minnows Petrocub at Tynecastle when a victory would have ensured European football would continue after Christmas.

Other big-game setbacks came against Celtic, Rangers and local rivals Hibernian, who resurrected their season after a similar dismal start to their campaign.

Critchley wasn't helped by long-term injuries to key players, such as Frankie Kent, Stephen Kingsley and Craig Halkett. And when you add in the dip in form of striker Lawrence Shankland, the football gods were never really in his favour.

However, he will accept that football is a results industry and those results were simply not there for him.

McKinlay and recently-appointed director of football Graeme Jones were at the forefront of the decision to remove Critchley.

Liam Fox, who took interim charge when Steven Naismith was dismissed in the autumn, will again take the helm but is unlikely to have enough support or experience to be considered on a long-term basis.

Jamestown Analytics will once again no doubt play a role in finding a new head coach/manager, so there are likely to be names mentioned once again who are alien to many of the club's supporters.

One name they will definitely know and is highly likely to be close to the top of their wish list is John McGlynn.

The 63-year-old has been in charge of the club before and is close to leading Falkirk back to the Scottish Premiership with consecutive promotions, even if they have stumbled in their past two matches.

McGlynn knows Hearts inside out and is keenly aware of what is required to be successful at Tynecastle. He will have his backers within the club without doubt.

Other notable names to be mentioned will be Kilmarnock's Derek McInnes and Stephen Robinson of St Mirren, who have been linked with the job in the past.

Regardless, whoever comes in will have to work with, and believe in, the use of analytics when it comes to recruitment.

This is a crucial time for Hearts. They have one of the biggest fanbases in Scotland and have had millions of pounds invested by the Foundation of Hearts and rich benefactors, but somehow they still cannot get things right.

Chair Ann Budge relinquished much of the control to McKinlay, with many fans now questioning if he should remain at the club in his current position.

The immediate aim for Hearts will be to ensure they remain a top-flight club as they are currently just five points clear of their next opponents Ross County, who sit in the relegation play-off spot. Dingwall on Saturday could be nervy.

The players also need to show more than they have done of late. 

Against Dundee, Hearts had more than 70% possession but rarely gave Trevor Carson in the visitors' goal much to worry about.

The club hold their annual player of the year awards on Sunday but much of the talk will be around who is next for the Tynecastle hotseat.

Allan: A knee-jerk reaction to deflect by an inept board who have got it wrong season after season. Jurgen Klopp would have struggled under these circumstances never mind Neil Critchley.

Robert: Critchley is unfortunate to lose his job before the season's end, but he hasn't done enough to suggest that he's prime management material.

The suggestion that John McGlynn may be a serious contender to be his successor is, frankly, laughable. He's been there, done that, and he's too old.

Nick: It is the easy option to sack the manager but once in a while take a look at the players and weed out the non-achievers, also what about the director of football? They seem to always miss the bullets.

Alfred: The chief executive should bear the responsibility of appointing Steven Naismith and Neil Critchley and resign himself.

Robert: Just not good enough, so it's for the best he goes now and we try a complete rebuild.

David: Critchley was out his depth as much as the Hearts board are out their depth with regards to any football decisions. Changing the manager again doesn't deal with the core issue.

Steve: Failed to get us into the top six. Failed to get us to the cup final and was dragging us into a relegation battle. Clueless. Correct decision.

Fraser: Hearts haven't been good enough for years. Another under-par manager in thrust into the spotlight. The next appointment needs to be a huge name that has proven themselves in the game and has the ability to attract high performing players to Hearts.

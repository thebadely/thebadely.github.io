Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jack Carlin's Olympics ended last summer when he crashed in the final of the keirin

Sir Chris Hoy or Sir Andy Murray could not walk through the centre of Glasgow unrecognised. And Duncan Scott might draw a fair few second looks, even without the clank of his Olympic medals around his neck.

But, earlier this week, Jack Carlin quite happily ambled around the middle of Scotland's largest city without anyone paying heed.

Hoy and Scott are the only two of Carlin's Scottish compatriots with more Olympic medals after his silver and bronze in Paris last summer. Even Murray is one short of his tally of four, albeit he can trump Carlin with two golds.

Not that the ebullient cyclist is in the slightest bit bothered by his low profile.

"The last thing I want is to be stopped when I'm walking down the road eating a sausage roll," he says.

"Glasgow's got a very good way of not caring and I love that. I think, unless you play for one of the Old Firm, nobody's stopping you in the street. And, if they do, it's normally to have a go, isn't it?"

Glasgow and its denizens might care a bit more next summer, when the Commonwealth Games returns to the city.

Cycling will be a key component of the reimagined event and Carlin, who was at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome as a fan in 2014, will be a central figure this time.

As if a home Games - quite literally, given he now lives just up the road in the city's east end - wasn't motivation enough, the 28-year-old has a wrong to right.

Carlin has stepped on the podium 19 times in global competition but has never clambered up to the top step.

Sprint silver in Gold Coast, bronze in Birmingham, plus keirin silver three years ago, are the extent of his Commonwealth haul, while a broken ankle 12 weeks out from Paris compromised his chances at the last Olympics.

Now back home after several months in Australia and south east Asia -  "let's call it decompressing" - his focus is on next summer.

"If someone said to 17-year-old Jack, sitting in the stands at Glasgow 2014, 'listen, you'd be talking about a home Commonwealth Games, 12 years later, with four Olympic medals around your neck', I would never have believed you," he says.

"It's an exciting time to be Scottish and to be Glaswegian, for sure.

"I think, if we can emulate the success and legacy of 2014 - that was what really kick-started my career - and get one or two individuals who are like me in 2014 out of this one, that's a success."

Cole Palmer reacts to Trump joining Chelsea trophy lift

Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations were shared with an unexpected guest - US President Donald Trump.

Following the Blues' 3-0 win over Paris St-Germain in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump presented the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James before being invited to move aside by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.

However, Trump remained alongside James and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, and applauded as James lifted the trophy - staying in position for a few seconds before he and Infantino left at the rear of the stage.

England international James said: "They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay.

"He just congratulated me and the team for lifting the trophy and told us to enjoy the moment."

Cole Palmer, who scored twice for Chelsea in the final, added: "I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy.

"I was a bit confused, yes."

The conclusion of the revamped, expanded Club World Cup - which included extensive pre-match entertainment and a half-time show - was attended by 81,118 people at MetLife Stadium.

Trump watched Chelsea's impressive victory in the final alongside Infantino and said in an interview with Dazn at half-time that he was "having a really great time".

In a longer interview broadcast later on Sunday, he added: "Gianni is a friend of mine, he's done such a great job with the league and with soccer - or as they would call it 'football', but I guess we call it soccer. I'm not sure that change could be made very easily.

"But it's great to watch - and this is a little bit of an upset that we're watching today, isn't it?"

When it was suggested he could make an executive order so that the sport was referred to as "football" from now on, Trump smiled and said: "I think we could do that. I think I could do that."

The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup next summer.

Let's dive into the details: Eberechi Eze scored the winner for Crystal Palace against Man City in May's FA Cup final

Arsenal's dramatic move to steal Eberechi Eze away from arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur is a ruthless statement of intent designed to show this is the season they can finally claim the biggest prizes.

Spurs were ready to roll out the welcoming carpet for Crystal Palace's England forward on Wednesday, with every indication a deal for the 27-year-old was virtually done.

It then filtered out that Arsenal were assessing the seriousness of a knee injury to forward Kai Havertz, which could potentially put a dent in their attacking resources - a weakness that played a significant part in manager Mikel Arteta's side finishing empty-handed for the fifth year in succession last season.

Instead of taking the cheaper option of exploring the loan market, as was first expected, Arsenal went for broke in spectacular style by setting up a Â£60m coup to take Eze to Emirates Stadium.

Eze's move to Arsenal is not simply a devastating psychological blow aimed across north London at Spurs.

It is a clear signal the Gunners have no intention of falling short in their stated aim of mounting a serious Premier League title challenge, as well as going deep in the Champions League once more after reaching the semi-finals last season.

It is a strategy in stark contrast to the inertia that gripped Arsenal last season, when their failure to solve an obvious problem - by signing a recognised striker - cost them dearly.

Spurs thought they had Eze wrapped up, with the possibility of a cash-plus-Richarlison deal discussed, but Arsenal moved with lightning speed once they were confronted by the possibility of Havertz facing a spell on the sidelines.

Arsenal have been linked with Eze all summer, but it was thought their interest had cooled once Ethan Nwaneri agreed a new five-year contract, on top of signing Chelsea winger Noni Madueke in a Â£48.5m deal.

Havertz's injury, and its potential consequences, reignited that interest to leave Spurs stunned.

Arteta knows this is the season he must land a major prize, and to do so he has been heavily backed by Arsenal's hierarchy.

As well as Madueke, the Gunners have concluded moves to sign Spain's outstanding midfielder Martin Zubimendi in a deal worth up to Â£60m and, at least 12 months too late, a recognised striker in Viktor Gyokeres, from Sporting for Â£64m.

In Eze, who had two years left on his Palace contract, Arsenal will get a versatile forward rich in natural talent who is a match-winner - as he proved when scoring the winner against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final.

This was a follow-up to the spectacular right-foot finish that set Palace on their way to a 3-0 win over Aston Villa at Wembley in the semi-final. Eze also scored the Eagles' opener when they beat Fulham 3-0 at Craven Cottage in the quarter-final.

Eze has demonstrated he has the temperament and talent for the big occasion when inspiring Palace to the first major trophy in their history.

Arsenal will hope he has plenty of those occasions ahead.

He is a scorer and creator who will add real threat to Arsenal's front line, with 14 goals and 11 assists in all competitions last season.

Eze was a boyhood Arsenal fan and was part of the club's academy until he was 13. He may have been initially keen on a move to Spurs, but once the Gunners showed their hand there was only one part of north London he was heading to.

He has achieved his goals the hard way, spending time at Fulham, Reading and Millwall before signing for Queens Park Rangers. He left Loftus Road for Palace in a Â£19.5m deal in August 2020.

Spurs believe they did all they could to conclude a deal - apart from actually concluding it - but it is a hammer blow to chairman Daniel Levy and manager Thomas Frank, who also thought they had a deal for Morgan Gibbs-White in the bag only for him to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest.

Arsenal will revel in the local rivalry of snatching away one of Tottenham's prime targets, but the wider context demonstrates the Gunners are deadly serious about ending a wait for success that now stretches back to 2020.

Eze has previously admitted to "crying for a week" when he was let go by Arsenal in 2011, but the gifted forward has now been given a golden opportunity to make up for lost time.

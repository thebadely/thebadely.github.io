Investec Champions Cup

Tries: Niniashvili, Nowell, Berjon Con: West

Harlequins (10) 27

Tries: Murley, Green, Lawday Cons: Smith (3) Pens: Smith (2)

Harlequins stunned La Rochelle to claim a home berth in the last 16 of the Investec Champions Cup and knock out the former champions by denying them a losing bonus point.

A Marcus Smith penalty in the final minute saw Quins to a shock win on the road that also means Leicester Tigers claim fourth place in Pool 3 on points difference.

Tries from Cadan Murley, Tyrone Green and Tom Lawday were all converted by Smith, who spent 10 minutes in the sin-bin during the second half.

La Rochelle took an early lead through Davit Niniashvili, while tries from Jack Nowell and Thomas Berjon in the second half seemed to swing the momentum towards the home side.

Lawday's try on 72 minutes put Quins 24-17 ahead, and Smith's late penalty denied La Rochelle a losing bonus point that would have seen them qualify instead of Leicester, silencing the home crowd at Stade Marcel-Deflandre.

Despite their tough season domestically in the Prem, Quins dug deep to finish in second place behind Leinster and will play Sale Sharks at the Stoop in the last 16.

Niniashvili's try, converted by Ihaia West, seemed to set the two-time champions on their way but they could not convert their pressure into more points early on.

Smith's penalty got Quins going, and they led at half-time thanks to a try from Murley's dive over next to the corner flag, nimbly converted by Smith.

Chandler Cunningham-South's bust and deft pass then set up Green to go over by the posts to give Quins a 10-point lead after the break.

But when ex-England winger Nowell and scrum-half Berjon crossed for unconverted tries within four minutes of each other, the sides were level at 17-17 with La Rochelle on course for the knockouts.

However, Lawday latched on to a long pass to crash over near the corner, and Smith landed another difficult conversion to make it 24-17.

When the England playmaker kicked a penalty with around a minute remaining, the hopes of Ronan O'Gara's side were in tatters in a major shock in this year's tournament.

La Rochelle drop into the European Challenge Cup and will face Newcastle Red Bulls, currently at the foot of The Prem.

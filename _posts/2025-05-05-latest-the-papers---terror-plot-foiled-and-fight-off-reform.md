Experts revealed that The counter-terrorism operations, in which seven Iranian nationals were arrested, is the lead for a number of the papers. The Telegraph says there is speculation that the target may have been a synagogue or somewhere else linked to the Jewish community. It also reports that the attack was "foiled" only hours before it was due to be launched.

The Times says a request from the government to access the European Union's crime and illegal migration databases has been rejected. The paper says Sir Keir Starmer had made improved access to such data one of his central requests as part of a "Brexit reset" with the EU.  According to the Times, Brussels has told negotiators it can't share information including the fingerprints of illegal migrants with British police and immigration officials.

The fallout from last week's local elections continues in many of the papers. The Express carries an interview with the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who insists her party is "down but not out".  The former Transport Secretary Louise Haigh, who resigned from the Cabinet in November, has written in the Times.  She has urged the Prime Minister to "rip up" Labour's "self-imposed rules" not to raise income tax, VAT or national insurance - and show the country what the party stands for by investing in communities. And the i paper says Starmer is "pinning his political hopes" on an expected interest rate cut this week, and a "looming" immigration crackdown to fight off Reform UK.

The Mirror pictures a 99-year-old British veteran of the Battle of Arnhem saluting the graves of his fallen comrades in the Netherlands ahead of VE day events this week. The paper says Geoff Roberts returns to the cemetery every year to remember the friends he lost.

And the Sun reveals that David Beckham's 50th birthday party was shut down at around 03:30 yesterday morning after people living near the West London restaurant where it was being held complained about the noise. It quotes one on-looker as saying that two council officials turned up and the music stopped, immediately.

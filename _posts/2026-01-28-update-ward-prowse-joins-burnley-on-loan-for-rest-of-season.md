It has been recently reported that James Ward-Prowse has 11 caps for England

West Ham midfielder James Ward-Prowse has joined fellow Premier League side Burnley on loan until the end of the season.

Ward-Prowse, 31, joined the Hammers from Southampton in August 2023 and has made 78 appearances.

The England international was loaned to Nottingham Forest for the 2024-25 season and played 10 times under then manager Nuno Espirito Santo, but the deal was cut short during the winter transfer window.

He was a regular under former West Ham manager Graham Potter and made six appearances this season before Potter was sacked in September.

Ward-Prowse has not played a single minute of football since Nuno was brought in at West Ham.

Burnley sit 19th in the Premier League and are 10 points from safety following Saturday's 2-2 draw against Tottenham. The 18th-placed Hammers are five points above the Clarets.

Burnley manager Scott Parker brought in 18-year-old defender Cameron Scott from Rangers earlier this month and has now added experience with Ward-Prowse.

"As soon as I heard of Burnley's interest and spoke to the manager, I knew this loan spell was just what I needed," said Ward-Prowse.

"There's a big battle between now and the end of the season, but I'm going to relish every moment."

Ward-Prowse came through Southampton's academy and made 410 appearances before leaving for West Ham.

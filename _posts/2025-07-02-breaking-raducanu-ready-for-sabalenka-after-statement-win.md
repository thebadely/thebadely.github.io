According to new developments, Emma Raducanu has won nine of her 12 career matches at Wimbledon and twice reached the last 16

There is something about Wimbledon which really makes Emma Raducanu tick.

Coming into her home Grand Slam, the British number one tried to temper expectations after a difficult grass-court swing.

The belief is already back. 

Raducanu outclassed 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova on Wednesday, moving into the last 32 for the third time in her four SW19 appearances.

The assured performance set her up nicely for a shot at world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a blockbuster third-round clash on Friday.

"I think that was one of the best matches I've played in a long time, which I'm very proud of," said the 22-year-old, who is ranked 40th in the world.

"At the same time, I didn't feel like I was doing anything outrageous, which gives me a lot of confidence."

Before the tournament started, Raducanu said she did not "truthfully expect much" from herself over the next fortnight.

After losing in Eastbourne last week to Australian teenager Maya Joint, Raducanu admitted she needed to get her "head in the game" for the start of Wimbledon.

She explained she had received some "pretty bad" personal news which she wished to keep private and, on the tennis side of her life, has been coping with ongoing back spasms since the off season.

But the 2021 US Open champion came through her opening match - a tricky occasion against British teenager Mimi Xu - without a major scare and upped her level again in a dominant victory over Vondrousova.

"That's quite a statement that Emma has put out," said former British number one Annabel Croft, who was analysing the match for BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I don't think she could be hitting the ball any better, I really don't. She was absolutely middling it.

"I would think that would be quite worrying for Sabalenka actually because she'll be facing Raducanu at her best.

"If Raducanu can play anything close to that level again, although she may not be allowed to because Sabalenka will bring a lot of power, she will give the world number one a run for her money."

What helps Raducanu flourish at Wimbledon is, of course, having a game which allows her to thrive on the grass.

Her athleticism and fluid movement on the quicker surface is a key strength, allowing her to get into position to inject the extra aggression she is trying to find in her shots.

Along with her serve, the forehand is a weapon which she has been particularly looking to further develop with coach Mark Petchey.

Against Vondrousova, Raducanu stayed patient in the rallies by using her backhand effectively and, once she had neutralised the variety of her increasingly frustrated opponent, she was able to attack more.

Wimbledon's shot quality analysis - which measures the success of a player's key shots on a scale of one to 10 based on speed, spin, depth and impact - rated her forehand at 8.2.

That is well above the average of 7.0 in the women's draw.

"I think what's going to be the real difference for me to get up to the top [of the rankings] is going to be the aggressive side," said Raducanu.

"I think taking calculated risks more and taking my shots on, and starting the point as well. Against the top girls, you really need to have a weapon on serve and also from the back."

Raducanu landed 72% of her first serves, and 81% of her returns, against Vondrousova

Since bringing Petchey back into her team, Raducanu has cut a much more relaxed figure and it is allowing her to play with greater freedom.

Having a tight-knit and trusted group around her is a key factor in the progress she made this season.

Raducanu has had a tumultuous time since her stunning US Open victory, but she has regained her place in the world's top 40 after a productive few months.

Feeling "at home" at Wimbledon and being able to hang out with friends, who she was seen taking selfies with on the All England Club balcony after beating Vondrousova, is helping her mood.

"It's so rad. I have all of my friends here in one place. They've been my rock through everything," added Raducanu, who has reached the fourth round in 2021 and 2024.

"I had the same sort of routine last year. I just really cherish these moments because we know how hard it is week to week playing on the tour.

"When we're here in this sort of environment feeling at home, it's so special."

Healy guides record chase as Australia beat India

It is hard for Australia to break new ground. 

The highest summits have been conquered, the most spectacular too. 

This is the team that has won seven Cricket World Cups, plus another six T20 titles, and once went 1,294 days unbeaten in 50-over cricket.

The alternative records, those for the peak baggers and list tickers, are all that remain for a side that has won it all.

That it took until Sunday's three-wicket win over India for them to complete their first ODI chase over 300, taking back their record for the highest in the women's 50-over format, is, in truth, a compliment to the bowlers that have worn canary yellow (OK, Australia gold) over the past 50 years.

It is hard for their batters to hold a record if never given the chance.

Ultimately, the result of Australia conceding 330 was captain Alyssa Healy being given an opportunity to produce her latest masterpiece.

Then best known as the 19-year-old niece of renowned former Aussie wicketkeeper Ian, she debuted in 2010 after her nation failed to win either of the 20 or 50-over World Cups held the previous year and has seen it all through 15 trophy-laden years since.

A T20 World Cup win came three months after her bow and seven world titles have followed from 10 attempts across formats.

The gritty keeper was also there in Derby in 2017 when a semi-final defeat by India briefly halted the run of success.

That loss "drove us to rethink our standards," Healy said this week. 

At the next 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, Healy made 170 against England in the final and was named player of the tournament. She ensured her country would not fall short again.

Whether this latest epic knock topped that previous effort can be debated. 

Some will argue the case for the pressure of a final. Others can counter with the challenge that comes when facing a record target and a raucous India-supporting crowd of 20,000.

What is certain is this century was far harder to see coming. 

The Christchurch carnage in 2022 came as she topped the run-scoring charts, but this knock followed six innings in India since the start of last month in which she had failed to pass 30.

"If you've been watching me in the nets, it's been a frustrating experience because I feel like I've had no rhythm whatsoever," said Healy.

"But once you step out on the field, your competitive instincts kick in and you just lock into the contest."

Healy's competitiveness has always been her great strength - and a priceless quality  in replacing legendary former captain Meg Lanning.

She was tormented by India's rising star Kranti Gaud in last month's ODI series, dismissed by the 22-year-old seamer in all three matches, but here that only provided Healy's spark.

A single came off Gaud's first delivery and from there the right-hander was on her way.

"An opportunity to go out there and lock in a contest with her and just have a bit of fun in that regard, sort of got me going," said Healy.

She reached fifty in 35 balls - her fastest at a World Cup - and her hundred in 84 as she flogged anything short, hitting 21 fours and three sixes.

By the time she was dismissed her side needed 66 more at a run-a-ball - an unconquered height now requiring a leisurely stroll. 

"To chase 330 is new territory so I am glad we have the confidence to do that now," added Healy.

"Hopefully we don't have to do it again but, if we do, we know we can do it."

Those words will be the last Australia's opponents at this World Cup need to hear.

Over the past five days a feeling they will win from any position has only strengthened - this triumph following victory over Pakistan by 107 runs despite being 76-7 at one stage.

Next Australia play Bangladesh before a meeting with old rivals England in Indore in 10 days, by which point a semi-final place may well be secure. 

It was at that stage they exited last year's T20 World Cup in a shock defeat by South Africa - a match Healy missed because of ruptured tissue in her foot as she led her country for the first time at a major tournament.

So great is her will, she later said she wished she had played through the pain.

But while she later admitted those injuries have pushed back thoughts of retirement, this World Cup is expected to be her last as captain in 50-over cricket and she is yet to win a global event as skipper. 

Victory in India would take her to the summit of her final mountain.

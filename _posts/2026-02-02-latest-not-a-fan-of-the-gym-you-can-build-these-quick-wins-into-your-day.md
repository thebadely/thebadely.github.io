Let's dive into the details: Join the gym, run up a mountain, sign up for spin classes. We are constantly being told to go to great lengths - and get very sweaty - to get fit.

What if you just don't have the time or inclination?

Jo Blodgett has the answer: activity "snacks" that you can almost effortlessly add in to your daily schedule. 

Blodgett is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health at University College London and has studied the impact that small bursts of action can have on your health.

High intensity exercise - getting out of breath, getting your heartbeat up - is really beneficial, but it is only part of the picture, she told the BBC Radio Four podcast What's Up Doc?

Here she explains how you can get fitter without a special outfit or a gym membership.

There are loads of ways you can add "exercise snacks" into your day, says Blodgett. 

Officially she calls it "vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity" or "VILPA" - essentially briefly increasing your effort during routine activities.

"It's about finding opportunities in your daily life that are going to push you a little bit more," she says.

She suggests:

Fortunately, if you are not currently moving much, adding in just three or four bouts of intense movement, lasting one or two minutes each, can make a big difference to heart disease and life expectancy.

If you do already manage to fit in regular gym workouts, or a game of football once a week, you can stop feeling smug now. 

Plenty of us are what Blodgett calls "active couch potatoes".

Of course those activities are "a good thing" she says, but they won't make up for sitting all day at work staring at a screen or spending the evening slouching on the couch.

"Thirty minutes in the gym is only a tiny part of it", she points out. "What about the other 23-and-a-half hours?"

If that is you, she advises:

The evidence suggests sitting only for very short periods is best. 

"Every 15, 30 minutes, can you stand up, shake around, sit back down?" says Blodgett.

This does not mean you should quit the gym.

There is still a hierarchy, with higher intensity activity, that raises the heart rate, still offering the biggest fitness and health gains, followed by moderate activity such as walking, says Blodgett.

Health guidelines tend to focus on how much vigorous exercise you should be aiming for.

Blodgett suggests flipping that and seeing if you can reduce the time you are not moving.

A few countries including Canada and Australia have started using this message. Assuming you sleep for eight hours, at least half of the time you're awake - eight hours - should be spent on the move.

Blodgett says:

There is no golden rule for how much is enough, says Blodgett. The more you move the better.

It has been recently reported that Stephen Lawrence was murdered 32 years ago

The Football Foundation is to provide financial backing for an education scheme set up in the name of Stephen Lawrence, the teenager murdered in a racist attack in 1993.

The English football charity - which is backed by funding from the Football Association (FA), Premier League and government - will provide career development opportunities for the Stephen Lawrence Scholarship.

The scheme, in conjunction with University of Greenwich, will prioritise black students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and those who are estranged or care-experienced, looking to complete a leading architecture course starting this September.

Lawrence was an avid football fan and an aspiring architect before his murder in south London 32 years ago.

The initiative, which was facilitated by Charlton vice-chairman and former Chelsea defender Paul Elliott, hopes to help students gain employment in architecture-related roles in English football, such as designing stadiums.

"This partnership is a powerful example of what can be achieved when shared values and vision come together," said Elliott.

"It has been a personal honour to help bring these organisations together in Stephen Lawrence's name - uniting his passion for football with our collective commitment to creating inspiring spaces and life-changing opportunities for young people.

"Through the Stephen Lawrence Scholarship, we not only honour his legacy, but actively build on it, empowering a new generation."

Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, added: "The establishment of this scholarship in Stephen's name marks a meaningful continuation of his legacy, providing opportunities for the next generation and reinforcing the vital role that education and sport can play in transforming communities."

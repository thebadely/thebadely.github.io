Here’s what you need to know: Neil McCann and Billy Dodds will work together once again

Kilmarnock "have complete faith" new manager Neil McCann and assistant Billy Dodds can keep the Ayrshire club in the Scottish Premiership.

The pair have joined on contracts until the summer of 2028.

Former Dundee and Inverness Caledonian Thistle boss McCann replaces Stuart Kettlewell, who was sacked after six wins in 25 games. Under-19s coach Kris Doolan oversaw Kilmarnock's past four matches, taking one point.

The Rugby Park side are second bottom in the Scottish Premiership and visit Livingston on Saturday (15:00 GMT). Livi are four points below with a game in hand.

"We fully understand how important it was to get this appointment right," the club's board of directors said in a statement.

"After a thorough process, we are assured that Neil and Billy have the qualities, experience, and character required to lead Kilmarnock Football Club forward.

"We have complete faith in their ability to do what needs to be done to keep this club competing in the Scottish Premiership."

Dodds and McCann previously worked together as part of Barry Ferguson's interim management team at Rangers last season. Dodds also had a spell in charge of Inverness and was most recently an assistant at Ross County from 2014-17. 

"Both Neil and Billy know the Scottish league inside out, understand its demands, and share a vision that aligns strongly with the culture and values of this football club.

"This is a significant appointment for Kilmarnock FC. We are confident the players will adapt quickly to their leadership and respond positively to the clarity, belief, and ambition they bring at a crucial moment for the club."

Neil McCann has just been announced as the new manager and, much like Stuart Kettlewell, he was not the fans' choice.

However, every new manager deserves a chance and the Killie support will give him that although our patience is wearing thin.

Several new faces are required if we want to stay up and decent quality is needed rather than some journeymen.

Good luck to the new management team and a win at Livingston on Saturday would be the perfect tonic although it is never easy there.

Kris Doolan's interim reign ended without a victory and we once again looked like relegation fodder last weekend as Hibs briefly got out of second gear to brush us aside.

There was a 15-minute spell in the second half when it looked like we might get something from the game but our lack of quality and rock-bottom confidence is there for all to see.

I've been a Killie fan since JFK was shot so it's a sad day when The Traitors ends up being your Saturday highlight.

Every game is massive when you are in 11th place but the trip to Livingston is your archetypal six-pointer.

Matt: Good choice but a hard gig to turn the season around.

Brett: Really happy with the appointment of Neil McCann and Billy Dodds - both know the Scottish Premiership very well and Neil is a really serious tactician in the game. Realistically we would have struggled to get a better duo with any less risk.

Adam: Was hoping for Robbie Neilson. Am willing to give McCann a chance but can he walk the walk? Seems a bit desperate from Killie, but clearly our budget is like our balloons, our belief and our ambition: deflated and shrinking by the day.

Jim: I agree that both know the Scottish game inside out.  My only worry is both have not set the heather on fire in previous management jobs. But let's see, it is now damage limitation as that damage was done with Kettlewell. Let's see if we can get better players in the Januar window.

Amy: The cheap appointment once again and the club have fallen for a good talker one more time. He doesn't have the managerial experience required and I really fear for us now. Speaking well on the Sportscene couch and managing a sinking football club are two massively different tasks.

David: A horrendous appointment. The board preparing us for relegation.  To go from European football and Derek McInnes to this in a short period of time is quite something.

It has been recently reported that Emma Thacker sealed victory over Birmingham Panthers with London Mavericks' 16th super shot of the game

London Mavericks produced a thrilling fightback at Birmingham Panthers to win 69-67 and maintain their play-off push in the Netball Super League.

Sunday's victory ensured the Mavericks remain fourth â in the final play-off spot â and six points clear of fifth-placed Nottingham Forest, with six points left to play for in the remaining two matches of the regular season.

But the London side face a difficult run-in against defending champions Loughborough Lightning and Manchester Thunder, who have both already qualified for the play-offs, while Forest have a superior goal difference.

"The race for the top four is still on," claimed Mavericks head coach Camilla Buchanan. 

"But we are absolutely over the moon that we are still in this and we will look over the remaining two games to just get stronger still and the rest will take care of itself."

The Mavericks trailed by nine points after the first quarter and despite turning the game around to lead 36-31 at half-time never managed to pull away from a Panthers side that boast the most bonus points â awarded for narrow defeats - in the NSL.

Roared on by the home crowd at the Skydome in Coventry, the Panthers once more turned the game on its head to lead by five points late in the fourth quarter.

But the Mavericks levelled with a run of unanswered two-point scores from Emily Andrew, while Emma Thacker sealed victory with the winning super shot in the final minute.

Elsewhere on Sunday, London Pulse, who have also qualified for the play-offs, moved back into top spot with a comprehensive 73-50 win at home to second-bottom Leeds Rhinos.

Rolene Streutker joined Nottingham Forest in 2025 to play in the Netball Super League for the first time

Nottingham Forest, who are competing in their first NSL season, had kept their play-off hopes alive with a 66-62 win against second-placed Loughborough Lightning on Saturday.

They led after every quarter in an impressive display at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, which is home to both teams. Particularly strong performances came from player of the match Natasha Pavelin and Rolene Streutker, who scored 41 goals.

The victory halted Loughborough's winning streak - they had not lost since Forest beat them in round four.

"Really happy, we knew coming into the game we could do a job," Pavelin told Sky Sports. "We all really believed. We put out four quarters there which we can be really proud of."

Third-placed Thunder, inspired by 37 goals from Elmere van der Berg, clinched their play-off spot on Friday with a 59-54 win over Cardiff Dragons at Belle Vue Arena.

Goal shooter Georgia Rowe scored 26 for Dragons, who remain bottom after losing all but one of their 12 matches so far.

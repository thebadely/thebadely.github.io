Wales boss Craig Bellamy says he feels part of a big football nation now as his side battle to finish second in their World Cup qualifying group. 

Travelling Wales fans are set to outnumber home supporters in Liechtenstein on Saturday with around 3,000 expected in Vaduz.

Wales will secure second spot and a higher seeding pot in the play-offs if they beat Liechtenstein and then North Macedonia on Tuesday.

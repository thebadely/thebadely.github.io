According to new developments, Brendan Rodgers' Celtic played Kevin Muscat's Yokohama F.Marinos side in a 2023 pre-season friendly

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers is ready for the challenge Kevin Muscat would bring if the former Australia defender is appointed as the new Rangers boss.

Rangers are close to agreeing a deal for Muscat, 52, to become their new head coach with personal terms and details still to be finalised.

Previous head coach Russell Martin was dismissed after just 123 days in charge before the international break and Shanghai Port manager Muscat has emerged as the favourite to replace him, after Steven Gerrard rejected the chance to return to the Ibrox dugout.

Shanghai Port are closing in on back-to-back Chinese Super League titles and Muscat has also won leagues in Australia and Japan with Melbourne Victory and Yokohama F Marinos respectively.

"I think every team that changes manager, you accept and take on the challenge of new ideas and that freshness that they may bring," Rodgers said, before Celtic's Premiership trip to Dundee on Sunday.

Rodgers admits he is not close with Muscat, but they have met as coaches more than once.

Celtic were beaten 6-4 by Muscat's Yokohama F Marinos side in July 2023 and Rodgers recalls meeting the prospective new Rangers boss when he worked under Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou during his time in charge of Melbourne Victory.

"I don't know Kevin that well, but I came across him a few times when I was at Liverpool," Rodgers said.

"He came in to training when I was manager at Liverpool and I spent some time with him there.

"And then, of course, when we travelled over to Australia with Liverpool and met him and Ange when I was there.

"So yeah, as I said, I don't know him that well, but he's done a really good job in the teams that he's been at in Asia and if he's to be the new manager coming in, it's another new challenge, and as I said, for us, we'll be ready for it."

Celtic drew 0-0 against Rangers in Russell Martin's only Old Firm derby as head coach

Martin required a police escort from the Falkirk Stadium after his final match in charge of Rangers - a 1-1 Premiership draw - and was sacked hours later.

However, Rodgers believes the former Swansea and Southampton head coach will benefit from his time in Glasgow and backed him to recover from his chastening Ibrox spell.

"You're always disappointed when any manager loses his job and Russell will be no different," Rodgers said.

"It was a challenge that he'll learn from in his career, he's got many more years left as a coach and a manager and I've always said, when you manage here at Celtic or Rangers, the pressure really is relentless.

"And you find out things about yourself in this role, in this job, and I'm sure he will have done that.

"I wish him all the best and he'll probably have a bit of time out and then look to go again and use this experience."

Let's dive into the details: Three more suspects have been arrested by counter-terrorism police investigating the attack on a Manchester synagogue which left two people dead. 

Officers said a man and two women, aged between 18 and their mid-40s, were detained following the attack by Jihad Al-Shamie at the synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, on Thursday. 

They also said they had information that Al-Shamie, 35, had gone to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on foot before returning in a car 15 minutes later when the attack began.

Head of Counter Terrorism Policing Laurence Taylor confirmed Al-Shamie had a criminal history that was not related to terrorism, and was on bail over a rape allegation.

There had been a large police presence in Central Avenue, Farnworth, Bolton, from Thursday evening into Friday, and multiple eyewitnesses said they had seen at least one man and one woman being arrested there. 

Police have confirmed the activity was in relation to the synagogue attack investigation. 

In total, six people are in custody on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.

Mr Taylor added: "We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later.

"I would like to once again stress that our investigation is still in its early stages.

"I know there is significant public interest in this case, and we will seek to provide timely updates on our progress where possible."

Mr Taylor added that police were working on the belief that Al-Shamie "may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology".

He also said that the attacker had been confronted by security at the synagogue about 15 minutes before the attack, returning at about 09:30 BST in a vehicle and driving at the building. 

Melvin Cravitz, 66, who had been providing volunteer security at the site, was killed in the attack, and 53-year-old Adrian Daulby is believed to have died when he was mistakenly hit by a police bullet fired in a bid to stop Al-Shamie breaking into the temple. 

The Independent Office For Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the use of lethal force by Greater Manchester Police during the incident, including "whether police may have caused or contributed to the death" of Mr Daulby.

The IOPC said it would also examine the role officers may have had in the injury suffered to a third man, Yoni Finlay, who is recovering in hospital.

It is understood both Mr Daulby and Mr Finlay were inside the synagogue trying to prevent Al-Shamie from entering when they were hit by police bullets. 

IOPC director Emily Barr said: "Police investigations are ongoing and there are measures in place to ensure our inquiries do not get in the way of the vital work being done to keep people safe. 

"However, we are also required to ensure there is an independent investigation to understand the circumstances that have led to the use of lethal force by police."

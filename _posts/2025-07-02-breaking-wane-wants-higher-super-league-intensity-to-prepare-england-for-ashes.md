Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Hull KR and Warrington played a game of great intensity and defensive mettle in the 2025 Challenge Cup final at Wembley - where the first Test takes place

England head coach Shaun Wane wants Super League's big names to ramp up the intensity of club matches to aid preparation for the autumn Test series against Australia.

The 60-year-old has selected a 32-strong Super League-based squad to help embed his messages for the series against the world champions, before his contingent of Australia-based National Rugby League (NRL) players bolster the ranks come the end of the club season.

Wane is using the gathering to show players what he expects and what he wants them to do better, getting them in to understand his demands at the elite level.

While plenty of individuals have impressed in Super League this season, with six uncapped additions to the group on the basis of individual form, the overall standard at times has left the coach wanting more.

"I look at the St Helens and Leeds game from the other week, and that was intense," Wane told BBC Sport. "But, I need a lot more Test match standard games.

"That's what the [Super League] coaches want and it's what they're striving for. But what I need is more low-scoring [matches], teams going at it, where there aren't many errors and mistakes and no penalties. That's the preparation we need for the Ashes."

England face Australia at Wembley on 25 October, Everton's new Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and AMT Headingley on 8 November (all 14:30 kick-offs) - with all three matches televised live in the UK on the BBC.

While Wane grapples with his own issues, notably a lack of time on the field with his players, there are still plenty of things for their autumn opponents to sort out before they board the flights for the 'Old Dart'.

Firstly, a coach needs to be appointed, after long-standing boss Mal Meninga left his role to take up the position at new NRL franchise Perth Bears, who do not enter the competition until 2027 but for whom an entire roster needs to be raised.

Then there are the logistics, which still need fixing if former captain Brad Fittler's interview with Australian radio station 2GB is to be believed, citing a need to sort accommodation, training facilities, kit and other tour essentials.

Fittler ruled himself out of the job, citing his media commitments, and the most recent links have suggested Cameron Smith, another former Kangaroos, could take it on.

Regardless of who picks up the baton, Wane expects high-quality opposition come October.

"I hope they are in some disarray, that would perfect! Any help I can get the better," Wane joked.

"But, they've got a great team, some great players to pick from, they'll be competitive and whoever the coach is so when they come over here in October they'll be ready to play.

"If we can have a full stadium to make it as harsh as we can at Wembley, that'll do for me."

The recent State of Origin representative series - which will come to a head on 9 July in Sydney - is locked at one game each between New South Wales and Queensland, and has helped the England coaches get a flavour of what to expect.

"I'm Whatsapping my staff, Lee Briers and Andy Last, during the game with things I want them to clip up - I look at it a different way," Wane added.

"I've watched the Origin five or six times now and I can't wait for the next one."

The prides of Wakefield: Both Owen Trout and James Batchelor come from the city and both were called up for England

While the six newcomers are far from guaranteed a spot when it comes to running out against the Green and Gold at Wembley on Saturday, 25 October, there is still something special about receiving the call for your country.

Leigh forward Owen Trout has played for England academy and was also a Knights representative - a side made up of those on the fringes of selection - but this is his first time in the full-senior ranks.

The Wakefield-born packman was proud to be able to call his family and tell them the good news, but nothing quite compared to the reaction he got from Adrian Lam, his head coach at club level.

"When I first told him, he jumped up and down and smiled with joy, said he had goosebumps," Trout said.

"He probably reacted more excitedly than what my dad did. My dad's not really an emotional guy. My dad was like 'Oh yeah, that's good' - yeah, very mellow.

"Adrian's a very emotional guy and I knew he'd be chuffed to bits and I'm glad."

Super League leaders Hull KR's pursuit of glory in 2025 has brought them the Challenge Cup, and one of their unsung heroes has been back-rower James Batchelor.

Batchelor saw his brother Joe capped by England in 2022 and win domestic honours with St Helens, and the opportunity to follow suit and become a full international is a major carrot for the rest of 2025 - as is the lure of facing the Kangaroos.

"When I was growing up, we'd be getting up at five or six in the morning to watch those internationals," Batchelor told BBC Sport.

"It was Great Britain more often back then against Australia but as you got older it became England v Australia and those big games.

"Seeing that rivalry and making sure it's still there, it's the same as in any sport, England versus Australia is a big deal and I definitely want to be part of that."

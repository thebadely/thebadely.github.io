Experts revealed that Healy won his sixth league title with Linfield this season

Linfield manager David Healy has distanced himself from rumours suggesting he may be interested in taking the vacant Dundee job.

The Scottish Premiership side are looking for a new manager after sacking Tony Docherty at the end of the season.

But Healy expressed his desire to build on the success he had this season with the Blues after guiding them to the Irish Premiership title before the split.

"I am going to Scotland this weekend but no [not for a job interview] and I'm not going to the Scottish Cup final," he told BBC Sport NI.

Healy was speaking after becoming the first recipient of the Manager of the Year award at the Ulster Footballer of the Year award.

He signed a one-year contract extension at Linfield last August after rejecting the chance to take over at Scottish Championship side Raith Rovers.

And Healy hopes to have clarity about his future at the Blues resolved before pre-season.

"I'm sure I'll sit down and talk about the contract, I've been successful, and I think the club know what they're going to get out of me," he added.

"I shouldn't see why it can't come to a conclusion; I think it has been timing and circumstances [as reasons why it hasn't yet been resolved].

"I contemplated a change last summer [moving to Raith] because I didn't know where I stood, but hopefully with the success this year, going forward we can build on that."

Here’s what you need to know: England celebrate Bukayo Saka's goal 

England continued their 100% record in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup as they beat Serbia 2-0 at Wembley Stadium. 

BBC Sport football reporter Alex Howell assesses how the players performed on Thursday - and you can see how BBC Sport readers rated them at the bottom of the page.

Jordan Pickford: England's number one did not have a meaningful save to make. 6

Reece James: As England dominated the game, James spent most of the time in attacking positions and was not up against much going towards his own goal. One of Thomas Tuchel's favourites and looks to be England's first-choice right-back. 6

Ezri Konsa: Just like the rest of the England back four, it was an easy night for Konsa. Good on the ball and kept it moving as he started attacks from the back. Only one counter-attack looked to cause him trouble. 6

John Stones: The Manchester City defender stepped into midfield when Serbia did not put him under pressure. Looks to be building a nice partnership with Konsa. Not much to deal with defensively. 6

Nico O'Reilly: A very comfortable first cap for O'Reilly. Took the ball in good areas and went into midfield from left-back, as he does for his club side Manchester City. His shot in the first half created England's opening goal and he almost added to the score when his deflected cross nearly went in. The 20-year-old has a chance to make a late push to be England's starting left-back at the World Cup. 7

Elliot Anderson: The Nottingham Forest midfielder has made the base of midfield position his own. He's a near certainty to start for England at the World Cup. Another assured performance. 7

Declan Rice: A quieter night for Declan Rice but he still showed his running power. His delivery from corners and free-kicks are of the highest quality and means he can always be a threat for England. 6

Morgan Rogers: Excellent play from Rogers to start an attack in the first half when he combined with Bukayo Saka, beating a defender and spraying an excellent pass to Rashford. Almost on target with an instinctive flicked header. 7

Marcus Rashford: A couple of exciting runs and curling efforts well saved. It wasn't England's best night but Rashford offered a spark at times. Nice skill in the first half when he put the ball through a defender's legs to get the crowd off their feet. 7

Bukayo Saka: Scored an excellent first-half goal when he volleyed in the rebound off O'Reilly's shot. Building a nice partnership with Reece James down the right-hand side for England. Had another half-chance in the first half but curled wide. 7

Harry Kane: The England captain dropped deep to get on the ball as England struggled to break down the stubborn Serbia defence. A couple of excellent passes to start attacks. Missed a good chance with a header in the first half. 6

Eberechi Eze: Came on as one of four changes. Showed in flashes why he is so highly rated with some of his trademark dribbling. Finished the game off with an excellent curled striker into the top corner. 7

Phil Foden: Just as Tuchel hinted, Foden came on as a striker when he replaced Kane. Went looking for the ball and always makes the crowd excited when he gets it. A late assist when he set up Eze on a counter-attack 7

Jude Bellingham: The Real Madrid midfielder was involved in one particularly good move when he combined with James, as England looked to add to the score. 6 

Jordan Henderson: Came on and took the armband. Played deeper next to Anderson as England completed the job. 6

Adam Wharton: Came on late, had little time to prove himself. N/A

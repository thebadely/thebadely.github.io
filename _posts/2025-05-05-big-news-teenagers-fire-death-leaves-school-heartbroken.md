It has been recently reported that The death of a teenage boy in an industrial building fire, which led to the arrest of 14 children, has left staff and pupils at his school "heartbroken".

A body, believed to be that of Layton Carr, 14, was found at the blaze at Fairfield industrial park in the Bill Quay area of Gateshead on Friday evening.

Police joined Hebburn Comprehensive School in paying tribute to Layton, with officers saying his family is being supported "as they begin to attempt to process their loss".

Eleven boys and three girls, aged between 11 and 14, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. They have been released on bail while the investigation continues.

The fire at the 15-acre site on the southern banks River Tyne was reported shortly after 20:00 BST on Friday.

It erupted in a large building on the estate which has largely fallen into disrepair in recent years.

Among the tributes left by mourners at Fairfield were blue balloons in the shape of a number 14, along with flowers and messages.

One note, pinned to a bunch of flowers, read: "Thank you for brightening up our lives. You will be missed beyond words."

Another said Layton will "always be in our hearts".

Meanwhile, more than Â£13,000 has been raised via a GoFundMe appeal set up for Layton's mother.

In his tribute to the "tragic loss of one of our pupils", Hebburn Comprehensive headteacher David Thompson said: "Our school community is heartbroken.

"Layton was a valued and much-loved member of Year 9 and he will be greatly missed by everyone.

"We extend our sincere condolences to Layton's family and loved ones at this incredibly difficult time.

"As a school, we will rally together to support one another through this tragedy."

People living near the industrial site said trespassing was a "regular occurrence".

They also said fires were common, but what happened on Friday was "out of the ordinary".

One neighbour told the BBC it was the "biggest fire" they had ever seen.

In a joint statement, local councillors Amanda Wintcher, Ian Patterson and Paul Diston said they "share our community's sadness about the tragedy", adding: "Our thoughts are especially with Layton's family and friends."

"I know this will have come as a shock to the Bill Quay community and I echo officer requests for anyone with information to please get in touch with Northumbria Police."

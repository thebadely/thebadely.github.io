Let's dive into the details: Police officers were assaulted and their vehicles damaged during a protest at a hotel used to house asylum seekers.

Hundreds of people protesting about the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping were at the site on Thursday, as well as a smaller pro-refugee demonstration.

Essex Police said one officer suffered minor injuries to their neck and eight officers in total sustained cuts, grazes and hand injuries. 

Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Hooper said those responsible would "feel the full force of the law" and confirmed two men had been arrested in relation to protests at the hotel.

"If you were one of the individuals responsible for damage, particularly towards my officers and vehicles, you can expect a knock on your door," he added.

Fireworks were let off and eggs were thrown at officers and at the hotel, after what started as a "peaceful protest", police said.

Vans and vehicles were "smashed" and the building itself was also damaged.

The disturbance prevented residents from being able to use Epping High Road, with police closing a section "for the safety of the public and those protesting".

The force said it had identified suspects who had carried out the criminal damage and assaulted officers, and was analysing footage from body-worn cameras, drones and social media.

Asked about discussions on social media about further protests at the weekend, Assistant Chief Constable Hooper said people should pass on any information to the force.

"We will not accept that kind of selfish vandalism we saw last night," he said.

"If you are coming to Epping with the intention of carrying out mindless thuggery, that is not acceptable."

He said the "selfish criminality and violence" began at 18:30 on Thursday, with everyone dispersed from the site by 23:00. 

Speaking earlier, Ch Supt Simon Anslow said the culprits "do not represent Epping or Essex".

"Nothing about the offending we saw tonight is representative of these communities, or the peaceful event that ended before this started," he added.

BBC Essex political reporter Simon Dedman, who was at the scene, estimated there were about 400 people there.

Last week, Chris Whitbread, the Conservative leader of Epping Forest District Council, called for the Home Office to stop housing asylum seekers at the hotel.

He was joined by two local Tory MPs - Epping Forest's Neil Hudson and Alex Burghart, who represents Brentwood and Ongar. They claimed the Home Office did not understand the "seriousness of this situation".

It followed the arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of alleged sexual assaults in the town.

Hadush Kebatu, from Ethiopia, was charged with three sexual offences, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity.

He was remanded in custody at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court ahead of a further hearing.

Weyman Bennett, a member of Stand Up To Racism who attended Thursday's rally, said: "Britain is a peaceful country in which people should be allowed to go about their business without being attacked."

Millie Smith, who lives in Epping and attended the rally, said: "There has been a lot of misinterpretation of who is here and why they are here."

The Home Office said it had "begun to restore order [to the asylum system], with a rapid increase in asylum decision-making and the removal of more than 24,000 people with no right to be in the UK".  

A 65-year-old man from Harlow was arrested on Thursday, in relation to an alleged assault which happened close to the hotel on Sunday.

He was charged with affray and was released on bail. He is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court in September.

A second individual was arrested on Thursday for failing to comply with the orders that were given around dispersal, and was in custody, police said.

It has been recently reported that The Afghan data breach continues to be the lead for several of the papers. The Daily Telegraph claims that, under the previous government, the Home Office tried to stop the secret relocation scheme for Afghans whose details had been leaked - because of fears about national security. It reports that several other government departments also expressed concerns about the scheme, but were over-ruled by defence ministers who used what the paper calls "emotional blackmail" to get it through.

The Times says secret intelligence used by the Ministry of Defence to keep the super injunction in place was deliberately withheld from MPs and peers. The legal order meant details of the data breach and the relocation scheme could not be reported. The paper said that judges questioned whether the intelligence and security committee should have been made aware of the leak and the scheme, but it adds that no-one on the committee was told because lawyers for the MoD had "concern about certain pieces of information".

The Sun and the Daily Mail both focus on the issue of compensation for those Afghans affected by the breach. Both claim that taxpayers could face a total bill of a billion pounds and that claimants could be paid up to a quarter of a million pounds each.

The suspension of four Labour MPs who failed to support the government's new welfare bill is the lead in the Guardian. The paper quotes one MP from the left of the party saying that the move made the government look "brittle", and that it was a "punishment beating".

A number of the papers carry a photo of Prince Harry wearing a blue protective vest - walking through minefields in Angola - as his mother Princess Diana had done, just before her death in 1997. The Metro reports that the Duke of Sussex - who's patron of the landmine clearance charity, the Halo Trust - spoke to families living next to Africa's largest minefield, and gave children advice on avoiding detonating the mines, in Portuguese.

And the Mirror reports that the television presenter John Torode is planning to take legal action against the BBC after he was sacked from Masterchef for allegedly using racist language. He denies the claim.

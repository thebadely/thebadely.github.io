Experts revealed that Matt Weston won the rescheduled race in St Moritz 

Britain's two-time world skeleton champion Matt Weston won the first World Cup race of 2026 to continue his impressive form in the Olympic season.

The 29-year-old set a track record of two minutes 15.67 seconds on his second run in St Moritz to secure his fourth gold from five races this campaign.

He also set a start time record of 4.75 seconds, while his combined time for his two runs put him almost one and a half seconds ahead of second-place Italian Amedeo Bagnis.

The event had been scheduled to take place in Winterberg, Germany, at the weekend, but was rescheduled because of bad weather and moved to Switzerland.

"It feels amazing to be back racing and pushing at 100% after the injury," said Weston, who continues to return to full fitness following a serious quadriceps tear.

"The race felt good: I know I've still got things I can clean up but I was pretty happy with the overall feeling. We've been working on some different stuff leading up to Cortina [the Olympics] so it was good to see that showing well."

Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer of Germany placed third, with Weston's British team-mates Marcus Wyatt and Jacob Salisbury finished seventh and 21st respectively.

Weston continues to lead the overall World Cup standings on 1,110 points, 150 more than China's Zheng Yin, while Wyatt is third.

The Winter Olympics get under way on 6 February.

Highlights: Crusaders 0-4 Portadown

Crusaders manager Declan Caddell says the 4-0 home defeat by Portadown was an "embarrassment" and a "disgraceful performance".

Eamon Fyfe opened the scoring at Seaview before Ben Wylie scored twice after half-time.

Ben Quinn added a fourth to condemn Crusaders to an 11th defeat in 18 Irish Premiership matches. 

"Their first two goals were comical, and once the second one went in we just gave up," Caddell told BBC Sport NI.

"That isn't good enough at this football club and I won't tolerate it.

"Today was unacceptable."

Despite the defeat, which leaves the Crues languishing in 10th place in the table, Caddell says he has "no concerns" over his role as manager, and believes he is doing everything he can to give the players a platform to perform.

"No, I'm surprised you asked me that, to be honest," he added when questioned if he was feeling any pressure on his role.

"There's no concerns from me. Ultimately it's a results-based business and they've got to improve. 

"Should we be higher than we are currently based on performance? 

"Probably yes, but results matter and we are where we are because we haven't won enough games." 

Caddell says the defeat by Portadown was down to a "mentality issue" and his young side "have to learn quickly".

"We started off slow and never got going. We conceded at a bad time, which we have done in the past couple of weeks," the former Crusaders midfielder added.

"We wanted a response from them at half-time but it never came.

"If you asked me if Portadown were excellent today? Probably not. 

"But they worked hard, got their goals and won every personal battle. 

"They had that drive and will to win, which we were lacking today. That's probably the biggest disappointment for me."

Caddell felt that "what happened on the pitch today is nothing to do with me or the coaching or the preparation" and said he has taken responsibility when he has got things wrong this season.

He says the players will have to respond quickly before Tuesday's north Belfast derby with Cliftonville at Seaview.

"It's to do with the willingness of players to put their body on the line and give everything they have. They didn't do that," Caddell continued.

"The players thought it was going to be an easier game, but you won't get anything in this league if you aren't going to roll your sleeves up. 

"Ultimately yes, it comes from me but now it has to come from the players to lift those levels."

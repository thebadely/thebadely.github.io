Scorecard. Tables

Suryakumar Yadav rescued India from an almighty scare and ensured the T20 World Cup co-hosts opened their tournament with a 29-run victory over the United States in Mumbai.

After being put into bat the defending champions and overwhelming favourites slumped to 77-6, putting them at risk of the biggest shock in cricket history â and one of the biggest upsets in any sport.

But the US crucially dropped Suryakumar on 15. Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.

The India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.

That denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.

As the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.

It means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.

England enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT. Ireland play Sri Lanka in Colombo at 13:30.

India's margin of victory was, in the end, comfortable.

Make no mistake, however. The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.

The home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.

The US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.

India opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.

Suryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.

His team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.

Making the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.

India's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.

It was a spectacular and much-needed knock.

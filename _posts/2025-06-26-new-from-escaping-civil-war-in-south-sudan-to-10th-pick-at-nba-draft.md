Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Khaman Maluach was drafted by Houston Rockets but immediately traded to Phoenix Suns

Khaman Maluach used to dream the impossible as he walked the dusty streets of Kawempe, a disadvantaged suburb on the outskirts of Uganda's capital Kampala.

On Wednesday evening, that dream became a reality as the 18-year-old's name echoed through the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, having been announced as the 10th pick at the 2025 National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft.

Forced to play his first games wearing Crocs after taking up the sport aged 13, Maluach's talent has already seen him represent South Sudan at the Fiba World Cup and the Olympic Games.

Even so, the 7ft 1in centre was overcome with emotion - with tears clearly evident alongside his smile - when he posed on stage with NBA commissioner Adam Silver.

"I didn't think I was going to cry," Maluach said.

"But everything was just going through my head; my whole journey, my people and the continent I represent.

"I believed in myself. I was delusional about my dreams. No matter what the odds are against you, it shows that you can win."

The teenager had worn a special suit jacket for the occasion, with lining which displayed the South Sudanese and Ugandan flags.

Back home in Entebbe, Uganda, where his family is based, joy had erupted.

His mother, Mary Aweng, elder brother Majok Madit Maluach and other siblings burst into a celebratory dance and said a heartfelt prayer as they heard his name called.

Majok described the moment as "a blessing" for the family and for Africa.

Maluach's family had planned to be by his side, but their visa applications were denied because of a United States travel ban affecting South Sudanese citizens.

Only his sister Agum Madit, who is based in Australia, was able to attend the event in New York.

Maluach's coach from the Solid Skills Academy in Kampala, the programme that first scouted him, was also meant to be there.

"That was really unfortunate. It has taken part of our joy," coach Wal Deng told BBC Sport Africa.

"But nevertheless, we're so, so proud of him.

"It's like a dream that's actually reality. Seeing how far he's come, from learning the basics of basketball to now joining the NBA, this is a moment of immense joy."

Maluach's status in the USA now looks secure.

After signing with Duke University he had obtained an F1 visa, the standard US student visa, which was subsequently paused for South Sudanese nationals in April.

That F1 status had already shifted back to a tourist visa while Maluach awaited the NBA Draft.

Now officially drafted, he will transition to a P1 visa, typically granted to professional athletes competing in major US leagues.

Many of the NBA's international players remain on P1 visas for the duration of their careers.

Born in 2006 in Rumbek, South Sudan, Maluach's family fled to neighbouring Uganda to escape conflict.

Raised by his mother alongside six siblings in Kawempe, basketball only entered his life after a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) rider encouraged him to take up the sport because of his height.

"The closest court was a one-hour walk and I didn't even have shoes," Maluach told BBC Sport Africa last year.

Yet his potential was quickly spotted by local coaches Deng and Aketch Garang.

"He learned so quickly," Deng said. "I told Aketch this kid would be the next big thing."

Within a year, Maluach had earned a scholarship to the NBA Academy Africa in Dakar, Senegal, his first major leap toward the global stage.

The teenager credits competing against the best talent on the continent with helping him "level up".

By 16, he was playing for South Sudan's national team, helping them qualify for their first-ever Olympics via their performances at the 2023 Fiba World Cup.

His performances in the Basketball Africa League and MVP honours at the 2023 Basketball Without Borders Africa camp cemented his status as a top prospect, and he committed to playing for Duke.

Five years after first stepping onto a court, Maluach is set to take the next step on a remarkable journey which has been built on belief and persistence.

"It's a day I'll never forget," he said after being selected by the Houston Rockets, and then immediately traded to the Phoenix Suns.

Deng, watching from afar, beamed with pride.

"Seeing him go from learning the basics to the highest level is really something rare," he said.

"He's a sign of hope to every African kid that anything is possible."

Maluach is keenly aware of his role beyond the court.

"I want to change the narrative of how people see Africa," he said.

"I'm thinking about showing them the great places in Africa like Kigali, Senegal, safaris. The cultures and the people we have is different from the stuff they see on TV."

The centre is eager to get started in Phoenix.

"I'm going to learn how to navigate the league, how to get better and how to stay consistent all year," he said.

"I'm excited to put on the Suns jersey that says 'Maluach' on the back."

His Duke team-mate Cooper Flagg may have been the top Draft pick, but Maluach has not hidden his own lofty ambitions of reaching the NBA Hall of Fame.

He has modelled his game on the likes of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid, and he now hopes to share the court with those very idols.

"I believed in myself before anyone else did," he said. "Let God take care of the rest."

After making the dream journey from war-torn South Sudan to the NBA, millions of African children will be watching and believing they too can make it.

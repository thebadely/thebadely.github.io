Experts revealed that Marine Nationale won the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham last month

Marine Nationale got the better of Fact To File to win a thrilling Champion Chase on the first day of the Punchestown Festival.

After victory in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham last month, Fact To File was the 11-10 favourite but struggled with the early pace.

Despite the hyped head-to-head between the two Cheltenham winners, it was El Fabiolo who had provided Marine Nationale with the greatest challenge only to fall at the penultimate fence.

Ultimately Sean Flanagan rode the 2-1 second favourite to a seven-length victory over Captain Guinness (28-1) under Rachael Blackmore.

Solness (11-1) was third with Fact To File the last of the four finishers. 

Danny Mullins won the Champion Novice Steeplechase at Punchestown on Champ Kiely

Trainer Willie Mullins enjoyed a pair of shock victories in the day's other Grade One contests.

In the Champion Novice Hurdle, 18-1 shot Irancy headed up a one-two-three-four for Mullins.

Cheltenham winner Kopek Des Bordes had been the heavy favourite in the race but finished fourth, with Irancy winning by nine lengths ahead of stablemates Salvator Mundi and Karbau.

"Irancy has always been a good horse and met with a setback after winning here earlier in the season, but it might have been the best thing to have happened as he came here fresh," Mullins told RTE. 

"I gave Kopek Des Bordes a nice break after Cheltenham and probably gave him too much and should have brought him to somewhere like Ayr or Perth.

"Looking at him in the parade ring, I thought he was carrying too much condition and that showed at today's pace."

Mullins, having trained five of the eight runners, also enjoyed a one-two in the Champion Novice Chase.

Champ Kiely (22-1) took the lead at the penultimate fence before winning by six and a half lengths from 11-8 favourite Ballyburn.

On Wednesday, Galopin Des Champs will be the main attraction as he aims for a first Punchestown Gold Cup.

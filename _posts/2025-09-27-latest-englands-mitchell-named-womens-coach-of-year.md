Head coach Mitchell praises 'phenomenal' England performance

England's World Cup-winning head coach John Mitchell has been named World Rugby women's coach of the year.

The Red Roses beat Canada 33-13 at Twickenham on Saturday to win the tournament for the first time since 2014.

England, who lost back-to-back finals to New Zealand in 2017 and 2022, have won a record 33 successive games, with Mitchell yet to lose since taking the role after the men's 2023 World Cup.

Mitchell's side  won a fourth consecutive Women's Six Nations Grand Slam and seventh straight title in April.

"There is a lot of swings and roundabouts in this trade," Mitchell said.

"But it is not just me as I couldn't win this award without my other coaches and staff."

Canada lock Sophie de Goede was named women's player of the year.

The 26-year-old, who plays for Saracens, only returned in July after 13 months out from an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

De Goede had an outstanding World Cup and won player of the match against Wales and Australia.

She also scored a try in Canada's semi-final win over New Zealand.

De Goede's team-mates lifted her up on their shoulders to celebrate her winning the award.

"It just shows the unity and joy and love that the team has for each other," she said.

"It's just a privilege for me to get to play with these women."

Canada came into the final 95% of the way towards their million-dollar fundraising goal entitled 'Mission: Win Rugby World Cup' - set up to help them compete with the world's best-funded teams.

"We have the ability as a team, a nation and a programme to win the World Cup," De Goede said.

"We could have done it today but just didn't put it out on the field. If we can have greater investment it will only increase the odds heading into Australia in 2029."

New Zealand wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee, 18, won the breakthrough award after scoring 11 tries to top the tournament try-scoring charts.

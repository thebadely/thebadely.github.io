It has been recently reported that A Grade-II listed building is set to open as a health and wellbeing centre next month after a £2.2m renovation project.

St Dunstan's House in Glastonbury will provide a venue for community activities including talking and pain cafes, healthy lifestyle courses, and health and wellbeing sessions for current and former members of the armed forces.

It will also host health and wellbeing group consultations for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart problems. 

The centre is expected to be operational by November with local MP Sarah Dyke describing it as a "landmark moment for the town". 

Ms Dyke said she hoped the centre would "serve as a model for other towns" in integrated, community-based care.

St Dunstan's House was restored using £1.5m of funding from the Glastonbury Town Deal alongside £500,000 from the Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Governments Community Ownership Fund.

Further donations were made by local trusts including Glastonbury Festival and Glastonbury and District Mencap.

The centre is set to contribute towards delivering care in the community rather than hospital settings, with its running paid for in part by businesses who pay to hire the space.

Support for businesses and outreach spaces signposting people to support for building skills and finding jobs will also be available at the site.

One of the groups will use the space is the West Mendip Primary Care Network (PCN), which is formed of five GP practises in around Glastonbury.

The PCN will provide guidance and support on a wide range of health and social care topics, from preventive measures to managing chronic conditions. 

Rachel Cheetham, the manager of the PCN, said it is "bringing care back closer to home".

"Some of the things we're looking to do are things around pain cafes, talking cafes, possibility some nutrition and cooking courses," she added.

According to new developments, Aaron Wainwright has won 61 caps for Wales

Autumn international: Wales v South Africa

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 29 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Listen on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru; live text commentary on BBC Sport website & app

Aaron Wainwright has been declared fit to provide some experience in what will be a much-changed Wales side to face world champions South Africa.

Coach Steve Tandy's men finish their autumn campaign with a daunting date with the Springboks at Principality Stadium.

The management team will be forced into changes because the fixture is outside World Rugby's official Test window.

That means that 13 members of the Wales squad - and 10 players from last weekend's 52-26 defeat by New Zealand - have returned to clubs in England and France.

However, Tandy is handed a boost by the return to fitness of Dragons number eight Wainwright, who was a late withdrawal from the planned XV to face the All Blacks because of a hip injury.

Wales have brought forward their team announcement to Wednesday and Wainwright will be available along with fellow back-row forward Alex Mann, who went off in the closing stages last weekend and then passed a head injury assessment.

The fixture will stretch Wales' depth, but attack coach Matt Sherratt is relishing the chance to go up against the Springboks.

"It's an opportunity to play against the world champions in our home stadium," said Sherratt.

"It's an opportunity for a group of players to show themselves against the best. Only good can come of that and we don't want to go into it with a victim mindset because you can come unstuck.

"We've got to focus on ourselves as a new group, look at the areas we need to improve in and if we see some signs of that then it will be a worthwhile game.

"We are desperate to put a good performance on the field and back the players we have available to us."

Wales will be forced into changes, but Sherratt insists giving opportunities to all members of their squad is not part of the selection process.

"We've got to pick the best team available for us to put a performance in for the nation," he said.

"If a player is in the camp they are not guaranteed a cap - I don't think that is healthy.

"A cap should be something that you work hard for, strive for and is the pinnacle of your career, it's not something that should be handed out just because you are in camp. Players deserve to be in camp, but then have to earn it."

South Africa made it back-to-back Rugby Championship titles in 2025

South Africa are also without some leading figures, but boast a strong squad that should ensure they make it an autumn clean sweep after victories against Japan, France, Italy and Ireland.

Sherratt said: "I don't feel sorry for them! You know what they bring and the sign of any good team is that you can close your eyes and see them play.

"They are a power-based team with a very strong set piece and very aggressive defence, while they have some exceptional athletes on the edges and the aerial contest is huge.

"We've got to take that on, we can't wait to see what they bring. We need to show plenty of intent.

"We are aware of the challenge against the best team in world rugby with some of our players missing. 

"Rather than thinking we have something to lose, we've got to think of it as an opportunity to see players perform who we have seen previously."

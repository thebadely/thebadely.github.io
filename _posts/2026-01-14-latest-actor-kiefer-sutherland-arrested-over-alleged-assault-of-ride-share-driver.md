Here’s what you need to know: Canadian actor Kiefer Sutherland has been arrested after allegedly assaulting and threatening a ride-share driver in Hollywood, police have said. 

Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland "entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. 

The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added.

Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment.

The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division.

Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland.

The Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation.

He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.

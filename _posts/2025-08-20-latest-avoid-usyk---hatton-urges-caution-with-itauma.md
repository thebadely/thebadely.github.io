Itauma stuns Whyte with first-round knockout

Ricky Hatton says Moses Itauma is a "brilliant" heavyweight but urged his team not to push for a fight with Oleksandr Usyk next.

Itauma's quick knockout of Dillian Whyte last Saturday ramped up speculation the 20-year-old could be ready for a world title shot.

Hatton, a multiple-weight world champion, heaped praise on Itauma, but called for caution as the Briton continues to build his career.

"I think they might have stepped him up a bit too quick," Hatton told BBC Sport.

"It was a very experienced performance, way beyond his years.

"They're talking about Usyk next, woah, let's just hold fire there just a little bit.

"Usyk will only have a couple [more fights]. If you look at the heavyweights coming through, it's wide open for Itauma and I think he can clear up."

Usyk, 37, holds all four of the major world titles but could be forced to vacate his WBO belt if he doesn't fight mandatory challenger Joseph Parker next.

The Ukrainian's team have told the WBO he is recovering from an injury and requested an extension to the 24 July deadline to reach terms with Parker.

With just 13 fights and 26 rounds under Itauma's belt, Hatton suggested the domestic route was better for a developing boxer.

"Fabio Wardley or Frazer Clarke, which are good domestic fights," Hatton suggested as potential opponents.

"Fighting domestic fights to get your fanbase rising. He has got his fanbase rising all the time, but I think that's what I'd do.

"Hold fire with Usyk because he's going to get even better, so why fight him now? Get a bit better and then fight him."

Ricky Hatton will turn 47 in October

Hatton, 46, is planning a return to boxing when he faces Eisa Al Dah on 2 December in Dubai.

Hatton turns 47 in October and says the fight will be "fully sanctioned" although it remains unclear if any conditions will be applied to the bout, like when 58-year-old Mike Tyson fought Jake Paul with bigger gloves and shorter rounds.

The Manchester fighter retired in 2012 after winning world titles at welterweight and light-welterweight, but fought in an exhibition bout in 2022.

He says the December bout could be for a "WBC middle east title" and played down concerns about a return to the ring.

"I'm not quite as old as Mike," Hatton said.

"Manny Pacquiao went straight in and fought for a world title [aged 46]. A former foe of mine [44-year-old] Paulie Malignaggi is doing a bare-knuckle fight.

"I know people are worried because I am so well loved and liked, but you don't have to worry.

"I know what fights are in my capabilities and I know which fights aren't. And this one is within my capabilities."

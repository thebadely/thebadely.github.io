Experts revealed that Alfie Barbeary is yet to be capped by England

Investec Champions Cup Pool 2

Castres (17) 20

Tries: Durand, Hulleu Cons: Fernandez 2 Pen: Fernandez 2

Bath (21) 43

Tries: Redpath, Hill, Dunn, Obano, Muir, Carr-Smith Cons: Russell 5 Pen: Russell

Bath closed in on winning Pool 2 and securing a home last-16 game with a convincing away victory at Castres in the Investec Champions Cup.

A bonus-point win over Edinburgh next Friday will secure top spot for Johann van Graan's side and home advantage until at least the quarter-finals.

Castres, who reached the quarter-finals last season, managed the wet and windy conditions well in the early stages and grabbed the opening score through hooker Teddy Durand.

Centre Cameron Redpath then crossed for Bath before the home side sent Nathanael Hulleu free down the wing to regain their seven-point advantage.

But the English champions, who played half of the first period with 14 players, took control of the game with Ted Hill, Tom Dunn and Beno Obano crossing.

Tries late on in the second half from Will Muir and Tom Carr-Smith to cap off an impressive win in France, which saw Alfie Barbeary star and be named player of the match.

One victory for every side in Pool 2 after the opening two rounds left little room for error for the Prem side, who bounced back from their away defeat by Toulon in round two.

Van Graan's side are tipped to be challengers for this year's competition and will be firm favourites to win Pool 2 at home.

With three trophies collected last season, the next challenge for Van Graan's star-studded side was to go deep in the Champions Cup.

Despite coming up short against Toulon in round two, Bath picked up a vital try bonus point that backed up their hammering of Munster.

Bath's ill-discipline ensured a close first half as Obano was shown a yellow card for an illegal clearout, with Muir getting an aerial challenge wrong to head to the sin-bin just as Obano served his time.

Ben Spencer and Finn Russell took control of the game, especially during that period, through their tactical kicking in wet and windy conditions.

Obano's try off a clever tap move was the fourth Bath try from close range as their brutal power - with number eight Barbeary at the forefront - key in changing the game.

The final two tries came via slick handling, but it was Barbeary's aggressive carrying that summed up Bath's relentless display.

The 25-year-old has always been highly rated and was called up to England camp by Eddie Jones in 2020 as a 20-year-old.

However, he is yet to be capped or used by Steve Borthwick, who despite saying he rates him "very highly", external added he had areas of his game he needed to work on.

Delivering in more big European games will make it hard for Borthwick to keep overlooking the number eight, who has an abrasive style that differs from the current dynamic England ball carriers.

Bath's Barbeary speaking to Premier Sports: "We knew they would come out firing at home because they are a great side, but we trusted our squad. We've got great depth off the bench and Guy Pepper, Josh Bayliss, Will Butt - they were unreal and helped us over the line at the end there.

"This is a big competition and every point is crucial, so to get a bonus point here - that extra point is huge if you look at the group. There is some fierce competition there."

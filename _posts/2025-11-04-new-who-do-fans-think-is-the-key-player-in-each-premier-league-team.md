Let's dive into the details: If Erling Haaland's form continues, he is on course to win his third Premier League Golden Boot in four seasons

"We cannot replace him," Pep Guardiola insisted on the eve of Sergio Aguero's final game in a Manchester City shirt. 

Four years on, do City find their fortunes tied once again to the fitness and form of a lethal striker with unique attributes and singular talent?

"Without him, it would be tough to be honest," Guardiola admitted after Erling Haaland's magnificent first-half double helped City leapfrog Bournemouth with a 3-1 win on Sunday.

Not everyone can boast a goalscorer of Haaland's quality, but each Premier League team has that one player they cannot do without - be it for their leadership, playmaking, or game-changing flair.

From the "soul of the team" to an "absolute warrior", here are the Premier League's 20 key players, as chosen by our fan writers.

Arsenal have made a brilliant start and are looking convincing in their bid for a first Premier League title since 2003-04. 

After 10 games, the Gunners sit six points clear of second-placed Manchester City.

Laura Kirk-Francis from the Latte Firm podcast has selected midfielder Declan Rice as the side's key player. 

"Is there anything Declan Rice can't do?" Kirk-Francis said.

"This season Rice has been imperious, not only delivering inch-perfect set-piece deliveries but now adding goals to his output.

"His transfer fee of Â£105m continues to look like a steal for the Gunners."

The 26-year-old, who signed from West Ham in 2023, has helped Arsenal to seven clean sheets while making five goal contributions in the Premier League this season.

Aston Villa waited five games for their first win of the season, before a run of four successive victories took them from the relegation zone up to the top half of the table.

Unai Emery's side trail third-placed Liverpool by three points but are 11th after 10 games.

David Michael of My Old Man Said blog and podcast thinks Villa's key player is under-performing. 

"Villa's squad relies on just one true out-and-out striker - and he has scored just once all season," Michael said. 

"Ollie Watkins has long been praised for his all-round play, and rightly so, but he's a confidence player and Villa can't afford to wait until he's 'in the mood'.

"In a system that gives him the trust and the minutes, the goals have to come."

The 29-year-old England striker, who is Villa's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League, has started every league game for them this season.

One of three Premier League teams to have lost just twice so far - leaders Arsenal are the only team with a solitary defeat - Bournemouth's bright start has put them in the conversation for a top-four place come the end of the season.

The Dorset club have 18 points after 10 games and sit fifth in the table.

When it comes to the most important player, Tom Jordan of Back of the Net podcast has little doubt.

"Currently Bournemouth's key player is unquestionably Antoine Semenyo," Jordan said.

"The explosive wide forward already has six goals and three assists to his name this season and is unsurprisingly grabbing the headlines.

"At only 25 years old, his ceiling is high.

"He can play anywhere across the front line, plus he possesses both extraordinary pace and power on a consistent basis."

The Ghana international, who signed from Bristol City in 2023, has played almost every Premier League minute for the Cherries so far this season - he was taken off during added time against Nottingham Forest.

After losing manager Thomas Frank to Spurs over the summer, Brentford are settling in well to their first Premier League season without him.

With 13 points, Keith Andrews' side are six points clear of the relegation zone and five points shy of fifth after 10 games.

Ian Westbrook of the Beesotted podcast thinks Danish midfielder Mikkel Damsgaard is their key player.

"He is the man who makes things tick for Brentford," Westbrook said. 

"His vision and ability to spot and play the killer pass is unmatched in the squad and if he plays well, results generally follow."

The 25-year-old has contributed one goal and one assist to Brentford's Premier League campaign so far.

Danny Welbeck has made 373 appearances in the Premier League

Inconsistent Brighton and Hove Albion have not had the same result in successive Premier League matches all season.

But after 10 games the Seagulls are within touching distance of the European places, three points behind third-placed Liverpool.

Scott McCarthy of We are Brighton has picked forward Danny Welbeck as the player the Seagulls can't go without. 

"He is the only out-and-out striker Brighton have who is Premier League ready until such time as Fabian Hurzeler feels confident unleashing the Greek teenagers [Charalampos Kostoulas and Stefanos Tzimas]," McCarthy said. 

"But it is not just the scarcity of other options which makes Welbeck a key player. 

"When he plays well and scores goals, Brighton tend to win. 

"Take note please, Thomas Tuchel."

The 34-year-old, who last featured for England in 2018, is playing so well this season there are calls for him to be recalled to the national set-up. 

He has six goals in 10 Premier League appearances this season and of the four games in which Welbeck has found the net, Brighton have won three.

Newly promoted Burnley may have made an uncertain start to life back in the Premier League but they are three points above the relegation zone.

The Clarets were among the most active Premier League teams in the summer transfer window, bringing 14 new senior players into the squad.

Among them was Slovak goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, 36, who has been their key player so far this season, according to Natalie Bromley of the No Nay Never podcast.

"While the football world would expect us to say Kyle Walker, it's hard to see past Martin Dubravka as Burnley's key player this season," Bromley said. 

"He's pulled out some incredible saves to preserve points in key relegation games and his Premier League experience has been vital."

Of the 60 shots he has faced so far in the Premier League this season, the former Newcastle goalkeeper has saved 41 - more than four stops per game.

Chelsea made significant personnel changes after earning silverware on the European and world stages during Enzo Maresca's first season as manager.

After 10 games, the Blues are seventh, level on points with sixth-placed Tottenham.

Chelsea are missing a big name in Cole Palmer because of injury, but Will Faulks of Chelsea News thinks 24-year-old Moises Caicedo has stepped up in the England player's absence.

"Cole Palmer is Chelsea's most important player, but Moises Caicedo is running him pretty close right now," Faulks said.

"With Palmer out, Caicedo has even become an important goalscorer and creator, as we saw on Saturday where he effectively won the game for the Blues single-handedly."

The Ecuador midfielder has scored three goals and made one assist for Chelsea this season.

After defeating Premier League champions Liverpool to win the Community Shield, Crystal Palace's unbeaten start in the league lasted until October. 

The Eagles sit ninth with 16 points after 10 games.

Alex Pewter at the FYP podcast sees wing-back Daniel Munoz as crucial to Palace's success.

"Daniel Munoz remains the team's key player," Pewter said. 

"His stamina and range allows Oliver Glasner's 3-4-2-1 formation to click, as a genuine two-way threat. 

"The fact that the club elected not to acquire a viable back-up means the team's success hinges more on his availability than on other talents."

The Colombian, 29, has made two assists and scored one goal in the Premier League this season.

Everton have made an inconsistent start to their 72nd successive season in the top flight. 

The Toffees sit four points above the relegation zone in 15th place. 

Mike Richards of the Unholy Trinity Everton Podcast believes that Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish is key to boosting their league position.

"It has to be Jack Grealish," Richards said. 

"He is constantly singled out for 'special treatment' by the opposition due to his quality and importance to Everton in an attacking sense. 

"He strikes a sense of fear into opponents and as he has proven already, his creativity stands out from the rest of the squad."

The 30-year-old England international has made four assists and scored one goal so far in this Premier League campaign.

A run of four Premier League defeats has left Fulham among the teams trying not to fall into the relegation zone.

After 10 games, they are four points clear of 18th place. 

Drew Heatley at Fulhamish has nominated full-back Ryan Sessegnon as the side's irreplaceable player. 

"He has found himself thrust into the first XI, mostly at left-back, as Antonee Robinson struggles with his return from summer surgery," Heatley said. 

"But he has quickly made himself indispensable, chalking up two goals in the process."

The Englishman, 25, has achieved a pass completion rate of 73% over nine Premier League appearances this season, according to football stat database FBref.

Leeds United signed Noah Okafor from AC Milan in August 2025

Leeds' start to their first season back in the Premier League has been mixed. 

After 10 games, the Whites are four points clear of the relegation zone in 16th place. 

Adonis Storr of the Roaring Peacock believes forward Noah Okafor is the player who makes the biggest difference for Daniel Farke's side.

"Leeds have struggled in attacking areas this season but Okafor has flair and creativity," Storr said. 

"It will be vital for Leeds' chances of survival to keep him fit and get him firing consistently."

With two goals, the Swiss 25-year-old is Leeds' joint top scorer, level with centre-half Joe Rodon.

Liverpool's title defence began on a strong footing, winning all five of their opening games before a run of four defeats knocked them down the standings. 

The Premier League champions sit third, seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal. 

Dominik Szoboszlai is their key player, according to Jordan Chamberlain of Empire of the Kop. 

"He's been the best of an inconsistent bunch this season," Chamberlain said. 

"Physically incredible, Szoboszlai works tirelessly and has flair on the ball, too.

"Arne Slot should play him in midfield [all the time], not at right-back."

The Hungarian, 25, has made two goal contributions in this Premier League campaign.

After a shaky start, Manchester City are six points behind leaders Arsenal. 

The 10-time league champions are in second place after 10 games.

According to Freddie Pye of City Xtra, there's only one man in the frame for key player at City.

"With more goals than every other Manchester City players' goals tally combined across competitions, is there anything else that needs to be said about Erling Haaland's importance right now?" Pye said. 

"Keep him fit and firing in front of goal with the right service, and we could be seeing a silverware-laden 2026 at the Etihad Stadium."

No one has scored more Premier League goals than the Norwegian 25-year-old this season, his 13-goal haul more than double the next best scorers.

Casemiro signed for Manchester United from Real Madrid in August 2022

Manchester United are finding their rhythm under Ruben Amorim after they ended his first season at the helm in 15th place.

They are eighth with 17 points but are only two points behind second-placed Manchester City.

Alex Turk at Turk Talks FC has suggested that Brazilian midfielder Casemiro, 33, is the one player that Manchester United can't do without. 

"Bruno Fernandes is the headline star and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are the new shiny toys, but Casemiro is the soul of this team," said Turk.

"United have conceded 18 goals this season, and he's only been on the pitch for five of them. 

"Not to mention he's getting in on the attacking act, with four goal contributions in his last five appearances."

Newcastle's patchy form - particularly away from home - has confined Eddie Howe's side to the bottom half of the table. 

The Magpies sit 13th with 12 points after 10 games. 

Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali has been chosen by Charlotte Robson of True Faith: Newcastle United podcast as their most important player.

"I don't think you can look past Sandro Tonali at Newcastle," Robson said.

"I've never seen a better midfielder play for my club - his technical ability coupled with his incredible work rate has saved us several times this season already. 

"That he has signed until 2029 at least is a huge boon for Newcastle."

The 25-year-old has made more progressive passes than any other Newcastle player in the Premier League this season, according to football stat database FBref.

Now on their third manager of the season, Forest have made a dismal start to 2025-26.

Winless since their opening-day victory against Brentford, Sean Dyche's side are 19th, four points above bottom spot and four points off safety.

Pat Riddell of the Famous Club has picked 24-year-old full back Neco Williams as Forest's key player.

"It's been a terrible start to the season for Nottingham Forest which makes this quite an easy choice," Riddell said. 

"Neco Williams has had his critics in his three seasons at the City Ground but this year he's been an absolute mainstay in the side.

"The Welshman always gives 100%, is up and down whichever wing he's picked to play on and manages to attack and defend with equal ability. 

"Commitment, fearlessness and determination mean he's easily one of the first names on the team sheet."

The Welsh international has played every Premier League minute for Forest this season, and has scored one goal.

With 18 points from their first 10 games, the Black Cats are fourth.

Gavin Henderson of Roker Report sees Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka as their most crucial player. 

"Sunderland have taken the Premier League by storm this season, but the man leading the charge has undoubtedly been our new captain," Henderson said. 

"Xhaka embodies professionalism and, importantly, determination. 

"Sunderland are not content with finishing in the bottom three, and that's because of the mentality Xhaka has helped to instill on and off the pitch.

"An absolute warrior."

Tottenham Hotspur are building after a season of mixed successes under former manager Ange Postecoglou. 

After 10 games, Thomas Frank's side are sixth with 17 points.

Ali Speechly of Women of the Lane believes centre-back Cristian Romero, 27, is the side's most valuable player.

"Haters will question his temperament but real ones know the Argentinian World Cup winner is in control," Speechly said.

"One half of one of the best centre-back pairings in the league, 'Cuti' can also spring Spurs into attack with thrilling through-balls. 

"As the team finds its feet under Thomas Frank, our captain must continue to lead by example."

The Argentine has contributed to three of Spurs' clean sheets this season, having missed two games with an adductor injury.

West Ham fired former manager Graham Potter after taking three points from their first five games.

Against Newcastle on Sunday, they claimed their first home win - and first victory under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo - which took them up to 18th place, three points adrift of safety.

James Jones, from the We Are West Ham podcast, said forward Jarrod Bowen is "undoubtedly" West Ham's key player. 

"Despite the club's recent struggles, Bowen remains the focal point for our attacking threat. Perhaps we're a bit too reliant on the captain at times but his quality and his love for the club shines through almost every week."

In the Premier League this season, no West Ham player has made more goal contributions than the 28-year-old, who has captained his club since the start of 2024-25.

Experts revealed that Three-weight world champion Lomachenko fought for a world title in just his second pro bout

Ukrainian boxing great Vasiliy Lomachenko â one of the sport's most decorated athletes â has announced his retirement at the age of 37.

Lomachenko claimed Olympic gold at Beijing 2008 and London 2012 in a remarkable amateur career consisting of 396 wins and just one loss.

After turning professional in 2013, he became a three-weight world champion in only 12 bouts â a record he shares with the recently retired Kosei Tanaka. 

"I am thankful that, as my career comes to an end, I have generated clarity about the direction a person must take in order to achieve true victory," Lomachenko said in an emotional video posted on social media.

Heralded for his terrific footwork, speed and combination punching, Lomachenko is widely considered as one of the most technically-gifted fighters of his generation.

He retires with a professional record of 18 wins and three defeats. His final bout came in May 2024, when he stopped George Kambosos Jr in the 11th round to claim the vacant IBF lightweight title.

Lomachenko paid tribute to his team and family, particularly his father and long-time trainer Anatoly Lomachenko.

"My father taught me not only boxing, but how to be a role model for my own children," he said. 

"I've made many mistakes in life and in the gym, but he was always by my side, correcting me when needed. I have many warm memories."

Following his stellar amateur career, Lomachenko challenged for a world title in just his second professional fight, dropping a controversial decision to Orlando Salido in 2014.

He bounced back in his next outing by defeating Gary Russell Jr to capture the WBO featherweight title, before going on to win world titles at super-featherweight and lightweight â cementing his legacy as one of the modern era's finest.

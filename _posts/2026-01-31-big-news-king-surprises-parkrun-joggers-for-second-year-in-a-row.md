According to new developments, Members of a cancer charity had a surprise visit from their royal landlord during a Parkrun earlier.

King Charles III attended the 5km (3 mile) running and walking event at the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk as a spectator. While there is Parkrun there every Saturday, once a month it is organised with Move Against Cancer charity's 5K Your Way group.

This is the second year in a row King Charles has surprised the runners by making an appearance.

Organisers of the "5KYW" event wrote on Facebook to say they had been left "speechless again".

"A heartfelt thank you to His Majesty The King for greeting us on the first lap of Sandringham parkrun in the beautiful setting of the Sandringham Estate this morning," the post continued.

The King has been receiving cancer treatment as an outpatient since early February 2024.

Parkrun was founded in 2004 and now hundreds of thousands of people across 22 countries and five continents take part in free, weekly, timed five-kilometre running events each weekend in parks and other locations.

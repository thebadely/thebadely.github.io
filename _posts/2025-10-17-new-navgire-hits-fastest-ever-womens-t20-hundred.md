Opening batter Kiran Navgire broke the record for the fastest century in women's T20 history with a 34-ball hundred in a domestic match in India.

Navgire finished unbeaten on 106 off 35 balls as her Maharashtra side romped to a nine-wicket victory over Punjab in India's Senior Women's T20 Trophy.

The 31-year-old former India batter shaved two balls off the previous record, held by New Zealand's Sophie Devine with her 36-ball ton for Wellington Blaze in January 2021.

Navgire's innings at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground included seven sixes and 14 fours as Maharashtra chased down their target of 111 in just eight overs.

She had a strike-rate of 302.86, becoming the only woman to score a century at a strike-rate of over 300.

West Indies batter Deandra Dottin holds the record for the fastest century in women's T20 internationals with a 38-ball hundred against South Africa in 2010.

Navgire played the last of her six T20s for India in October 2022.

She has scored 17 runs in four innings for India at an average of 5.66, with a top score of 10 not out.

It has been recently reported that Chelsea signed Madueke from PSV Eindhoven for Â£29m in January 2023

Arsenal have made formal contact with Chelsea over signing winger Noni Madueke. 

BBC Sport reported that the Gunners had already agreed personal terms with Madueke last week ahead of any potential move, but they have now made an official approach.

It is understood Chelsea are looking for a fee in the region of Â£50m for the 23-year-old England international. 

Madueke is currently part of Chelsea's squad at the Club World Cup and came on as a substitute as the Blues reached the final of the competition after beating Brazilian side Fluminense 2-0. 

The wideman has played 92 times for Chelsea since joining them from PSV Eindhoven in January 2023 and scored 20 goals.

Madueke was in Tottenham's academy before spending four and a half years in the Netherlands.

Arsenal are looking to increase their attacking options with both Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze under consideration. 

The Gunners have also stepped up efforts to sign striker Viktor Gyokeres, with Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta holding face-to-face talks with Sporting in Portugal.

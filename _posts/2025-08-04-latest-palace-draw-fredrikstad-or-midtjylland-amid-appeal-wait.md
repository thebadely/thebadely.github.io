Experts revealed that Palace beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup last season

Crystal Palace have been drawn against Norwegian side Fredrikstad or Midtjylland of Denmark, for the Europa Conference League play-off round despite an ongoing appeal over their demotion from the Europa League.

Palace were demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League by Uefa because of a breach of multi-club ownership rules.

Until recently, American businessman John Textor had a stake in the Eagles - which was sold in July - while being the majority owner of French club Lyon, who have also qualified for the Europa League. 

The rules of European football's governing body state that clubs owned, to a certain threshold of influence, by the same person or entity cannot compete in the same European competition.

Uefa's rules set a deadline of 1 March 2025 to show proof of multi-club ownership restructuring - a deadline which Palace missed.

Palace have submitted an appeal against their demotion with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) and a hearing for the case is scheduled for 8 August.

It is expected that a decision on the case will be given on 11 August.

The appeal is against Uefa, which issued the punishment, French club Lyon and Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest.

Forest, who finished seventh in the Premier League last season, are expected to replace FA Cup winners Palace in the Europa League should the punishment stand.

In the meantime, Palace have been included in the Conference League play-off draw.  

They will play the loser of a Europa League third-round qualifying tie between Fredrikstad or Midtjylland.

The Eagles are scheduled to play the first leg of their tie at Selhurst Park on 21 August and the second a week later on 28 August.

The winners of the play-off round will progress to the 36-team league phase of the competition.

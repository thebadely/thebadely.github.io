Let's dive into the details: Stephen Welsh has made 68 Celtic apperances

Celtic defender Stephen Welsh may require surgery after a recurrence of a shoulder injury.

The 25-year-old defender came off injured during Tuesday's pre-season friendly win over Cork City.

Afterwards, manager Brendan Rodgers said: "He's done his shoulder again.

"It's the fourth time it's popped out. You know when it keeps coming out like that, there's the possibility of an operation so he has to have a wee think about that.

"By the time the physios got on, it had popped back in but the pain was too sore so we took him off."

Welsh has twice been loaned out by Celtic, most recently to Mechelen in the first part of 2025. All in all, he has made 107 competitive appearances.

First-team regular Luke McCowan and 18-year-old defender Colby Donovan scored in Celtic's 2-1 win at Pairc Ui Chaoimh.

"He's very competitive and I like him," Rodgers said of Donovan. "He's very aggressive, he passes forward.

"He'll become a bit less rash as his career moves forward but I like his personality and I like his dominance and he can play football, which you have to be able to do when you play for Celtic."

Meanwhile, Sweden defender Gustaf Lagerbielke, 25, has left Celtic to join Braga in Portugal.

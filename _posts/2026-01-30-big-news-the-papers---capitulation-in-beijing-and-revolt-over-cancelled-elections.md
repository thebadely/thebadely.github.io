Experts revealed that Sir Keir Starmer's visit to China features prominently in Friday's papers. 

The Financial Times says the prime minister has been working to heal the ties between the countries. The Times says Sir Keir has vowed to build a more sophisticated relationship with China. The Daily Mirror says "closer ties with Beijing could reap trade benefits for Britain at a time when the government needs to get the economy firing". The Guardian says the "reset" in the relationship has opened the door to a visit to the UK by President Xi. The Daily Mail has a more critical analysis of the visit, saying "Sir Kowtow Starmer... announced deals so underwhelming, critics responded 'Is that it?'"

The Times believes the UK is to follow the EU in proscribing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. The paper says ministers will act as pressure grows to respond to the group's bloody suppression of anti-government protests.

The i Paper leads with the suggestion that the UK is to deport asylum seekers to Syria in a crackdown on migrants. The paper says the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is seeking to tackle the small boats crisis and the rise of Reform UK.

The Telegraph says the government's plan to cancel local elections for four-and-a-half million people is descending into farce - as a string of councillors have resigned over the delays. The paper says that several councillors across the country are considering whether to stand down to force by-elections. Labour is allowing some councils to delay the ballots because of plans to reorganise local government.

The Telegraph says the much anticipated exhibition of the historical Bayeux tapestry at the British Museum later this year could be scuppered - by potholes. It says French heritage campaigners have warned that vibrations caused by potholes both in the UK and France could rip apart the nearly 1,000-year-old embroidered cloth. "That's one in the eye for history fans," suggests the Daily Express.

The Sun notes that while most adults spend around £2,000 on an engagement ring, in the run-up to Valentines Day, Asda is selling one for 96 pence - less, it points out, than the cost of a cucumber. "Will you marry mean?" is its headline.

Experts revealed that Marketa Vondrousova has won just two of her six appearances in WTA finals

Marketa Vondrousova beat world number one Aryna Sabalenka at the Berlin Open to reach her first final since winning the 2023 Wimbledon title. 

Vondrousova, who has been working her way back from shoulder surgery and is ranked 164th in the world, came through 6-2 6-4 and will play Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu in Sunday's showpiece in Germany.

"I didn't play for a long time. I am just happy to be back healthy and so grateful to play these matches," Czech Vondrousova said on the WTA Tour website.

"When I saw the field here, I was like, 'OK, let's just try to win the first round' and then, you know, now this is happening."

Sabalenka saved two break points in the opening game but was broken in her second service game and again to trail 5-2 in the first set.

The three-time Grand Slam champion sealed a break at the first time of asking to lead 2-0 in the second but Vondrousova hit back immediately.

A tense scrap ensued with the set staying on serve until 25-year-old Vondrousova broke for 5-4 and then served out the match.

Wang beat 2021 Berlin Open champion Liudmila Samsonova 6-4 6-1 in the other semi-final to reach her first WTA singles final.

"This week has been a dream for me," Wang said. "Coming into every match, I wasn't expecting anything, it was really just to enjoy the stage."

In another of the grass-court events leading up to Wimbledon, Daniil Medvedev held off a fightback from world number three Alexander Zverev to win 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (1-7) 6-4 and reach Sunday's Halle Open final.

It will be a first final in 15 months for Medvedev, who will take on world number 45 Alexander Bublik after the Kazakh beat eighth seed Karen Khachanov 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-4. 

After taking the opening set against Zverev on a tie-break, world number 11 Medvedev wasted three match points in the second set, and required three hours and one minute to get the job done.

"I am happy with my level, I played great," Medvedev said. 

"I would have loved to finish on the match points [in the second set]. The first one I went for it and missed it. 

"The second one I went a bit slower to wait for a mistake and he made a great point. I am happy to win in the end."

As was the case during his quarter-final victory on Friday, Medvedev needed treatment for a nosebleed at 4-4 in the opening set.

The Russian has lost five ATP finals in succession, with his last triumph coming at the Italian Open in May 2023.

According to new developments, England and Wales both suffered defeats in their opening group stage games

We've reached the second round of group-phase fixtures at Euro 2025, and with it comes the chance of teams either securing their place in the knockout stage, or being eliminated.

England and Wales are both in trouble after opening-game defeats, while world champions Spain were ominously impressive. 

BBC Sport looks at how each of the four groups are shaping up - and who needs what to reach the quarter-finals. 

Euro 2025 TV & BBC radio schedule

The top two teams from each of the four groups will progress to the quarter-finals, with the sides in third and fourth eliminated. 

If two or more teams in the same group are equal on points at the end of the phase, the following criteria will determine their rankings:

Most points won in matches between those teams

Goal difference in matches between those teams

Goals scored in matches between those teams

If teams still have an equal ranking, the above criteria will be reapplied exclusively to matches between the remaining teams to determine rankings

If teams are still level then goal difference across all group matches is used

Then goals scored in all group matches

Then Disciplinary record

Then higher position in the overall European qualifiers

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Finland v Switzerland & Norway v Iceland (both 10 July, 20:00)

Norway became the first team to secure their place in the quarter-finals with a win over Finland on Sunday, combined with Switzerland's victory. They are guaranteed top spot because of their head-to-head record against both teams.

Hosts Switzerland go into the final round of games knowing a point would see them progress via goal difference.

Finland need to beat Switzerland to go through.

Iceland are eliminated. 

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Spain v Belgium (7 July, 17:00), Portugal v Belgium (20:00), Italy v Spain & Portugal v Belgium (both 11 July, 20:00)

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Germany v Denmark (8 July, 17:00), Poland v Sweden (8 July, 20:00), Poland v Denmark & Sweden v Germany (both 12 July, 20:00)

Denmark and Poland could be eliminated with defeats. 

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): England v Netherlands (9 July, 17:00), France v Wales (9 July, 20:00), England v Wales & Netherlands v France (both 13 July, 20:00)

It has been recently reported that The Champions League continues on Tuesday with 36 teams battling for the trophy, to be awarded at the final in Budapest, Hungary, on 30 May 2026.

This season is the 71st staging of the competition - if you include its previous guise as the European Cup - and for this week's big Tuesday quiz we want you to name the winners of the other 70.

You've got 20 minutes. This is a tough one - good luck!

Can you name every team in the Champions League?

Can you name the line-ups from the 2008 Champions League final?

Can you name every Ballon d'Or winner in 20 minutes?

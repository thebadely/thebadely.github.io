Here’s what you need to know: Stemaide's goal is to bring science and technology skills to all young Africans.

Started in 2022 in Ghana, it has developed a science kit that will work in areas without the internet.

Prince Boateng Asare, CEO of Stemaide, says the firm wants to prepare young Africans for the jobs of the future.

This is the second in a six-part series on technology in Africa.

Full leaderboard

England's Tommy Fleetwood made two eagles in a second-round 65 to take a share of the lead in the Travelers Championship in Connecticut.

The 34-year-old, who shot a first-round 66, sits on nine under par alongside world number one Scottie Scheffler and his fellow American Justin Thomas.

Fleetwood, who is searching for his first PGA Tour title, carded a modest level-par opening half but then surged up the field in the last six holes at TPC River Highlands.

He eagled the par-five 13th by finding the green in two shots then sinking a 10-foot putt before holing out from the fairway with a 30-yard shot on the par-four 14th to pick up two more strokes.

A 12-foot birdie putt at the par-three 16th gave him a share of the lead, with Australian Jason Day one shot back.

"I've been having a good season and I felt like my game was in a really good place going into the US Open last week," Fleetwood told Sky Sports.

"For whatever reason - I'll never understand the game - I played really poorly but in golf there is always another week and this week is a big week.

"I came out motivated to take whatever there is to learn to make you better for the coming weeks and so far this week I'm happy with how I bounced back."

Thomas reeled off five consecutive birdies in his six-under 64 while Scheffler carded a 69 to also sit atop the leaderboard.

World number two Rory McIlroy, who was two off the first-round lead, had a frustrating day with a one-over 71 that dropped him to four behind.

McIlroy made three bogeys in his opening four holes and turned in three-over 38, but three birdies in his next six holes recovered the damage.

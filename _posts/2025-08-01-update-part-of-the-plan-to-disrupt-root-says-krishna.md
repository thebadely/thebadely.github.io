'Not often you see Root lose his temper' - tensions begin to simmer on day two

India fast bowler Prasidh Krishna says it was a deliberate tactic to try and disrupt Joe Root when the pair were involved in a heated exchange on the second day of the fifth Test at The Oval. 

The exact words, which came when Root was yet to get off the mark and played and missed at Krishna, were not picked up by the stump microphones but the England batter was unusually animated in his response. 

Krishna, who took 4-62 as England were bowled out for 247 in their first innings, added that he was also taken by surprise by how it unfolded.

"It was the plan [to disrupt him], but I didn't expect the couple of words that I said to get such a big reaction from him," he said. 

"I love the guy that he is, he is a legend of the game. It's just when two people are out there wanting to be a winner and wanting to be the best in that moment.

"It was just a small thing, the competitive edge coming out. Both of us are good mates off the field and it was just a bit of banter."

Deep dismisses Duckett for 43 after reverse sweep attempt is edged behind to Jurel

England are in a tricky situation, with India taking a 52-run lead into day three with eight wickets in hand after Ollie Pope's side dropped three catches late on. 

Tensions have been high throughout the series, which the hosts lead 2-1.

Before this Test match started, India coach Gautam Gambhir was involved in a confrontation with The Oval's ground staff, skipper Shubman Gill accused England of going against the spirit of cricket with time-wasting tactics and seamer Mohammed Siraj was fined for his send-off of Ben Duckett during the third Test at Lord's.

Duckett was involved in another strange incident before Krishna's encounter with Root, as Akash Deep dismissed him for 43 and put his arm around the England opener's shoulder as he walked from the pitch. 

"I don't think I've ever seen a bowler do that after getting someone out," said England assistant coach Marcus Trescothick. 

"You've seen them having words, we've seen it from both sides in this series. It was just different. 

"We've seen it in the series already that Ben doesn't do a great deal [in response]. There was probably no need to walk him off in that fashion but the game has been fought in good spirits, there have been some words and arguments along the way but the two teams are still getting on well enough and will continue to do so."

Trescothick also acknowledged India's plan in trying to unsettle Root, who played fluently for his 29 before being pinned lbw by Siraj. 

"They made a comment, they tried to get after him and spark him up a bit. India tried a different approach and Joe bit back," he told BBC Test Match Special.

"Normally he laughs and giggles and allows things to happen, but today he chose a different route. Everyone has their own method of dealing with that sort of approach and today Joe bit back, that's fine - it doesn't make any difference."

England hurt by late drops in decisive final Test

Fifth Test, Day 2

A day for Thorpey

Having been bowled out in 51.2 overs with a lead of just 23, England faced a difficult evening session with an already depleted bowling attack having to cope without the injured Chris Woakes.

A lively morning session saw Gus Atkinson complete a five-wicket haul as England efficiently mopped up India's lower order once more, but despite much-improved consistency from Josh Tongue in particular, the tourists were not drawn into making the same mistakes later in the day. 

They were also gifted some assistance from England in the field as Yashasvi Jaiswal, who is unbeaten on 51, was dropped on 20 and 40 and Sai Sudharsan was also put down before he was eventually dismissed by Atkinson for 11. 

Former England captain Michael Vaughan says England have not helped their case with their selections. 

Batter Jacob Bethell, 21, is making his first appearance of the series and made just six, having played one red-ball match in seven months.

Jamie Overton, 31, came in as England were forced into bowling changes because of a shoulder injury to captain Ben Stokes, and with Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer needing to rest, but he has played only four first-class matches since September 2023.

Overton took 0-66 in India's first innings, made a duck with the bat and is so far wicketless for 22 runs from five overs - though the Sudharsan drop came off his bowling.

"The only thing I'd say on England's selection is they've picked people who have played no cricket and to throw them into this hotbed of international cricket, in front of this amount of people and so many watching on TV screens around the world, it isn't an easy game," said Vaughan.

"It is no surprise they looked a bit vulnerable out there - because if you're not going to play cricket, you're not going to have your body used to playing cricket.

"If you're throwing a 21-year-old into this situation on the back of one first-class match in our summer, I find that absolutely extraordinary. I don't think you're giving a kid the best chance of succeeding at this level."

WinViz has India as marginal favourites

Vaughan believes India were just in front of England in terms of the match position, and former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta was in agreement.

"It's going to be about pressure and so far in this series this India side have handled pressure well, and it's been a long tour - one more innings to go," said Dasgupta.

"You have to keep everything else away and just bat normally.

"The pitch will get better, it's just about how you handle it. At Lord's, it wasn't handled well. At Old Trafford it was handled very well by India." 

Meanwhile, former England captain Sir Alastair Cook said: "I am going England as favourites. On the basis that everyone tells me that the wicket gets better on day three or four."

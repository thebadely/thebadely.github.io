Experts revealed that Buatsi made his pro debut in 2017 after winning bronze at the Rio 2016 Olympics

British light-heavyweight Joshua Buatsi made a winning yet underwhelming start to life under new promoters Queensberry with a points victory over Zach Parker in Manchester.

The Olympic bronze medallist's work rate and punch output seemingly secured him a majority decision in a close 10-round contest at the Co-op Live Arena.

But Parker had his moments, landing some telling single shots in a fight where the styles never quite clicked, with excessive holding spoiling the action.

Two judges scored it 96-94 to Buatsi, with the third a 95-95 draw.

"It wasn't my best performance but what do champions do? They win," Buatsi said in the ring as he was met by boos from the crowd.

The Londoner returned to winning ways after his first professional defeat - an epic battle with Callum Smith in February - to claim a 20th career victory.

Some ringside observers felt Parker, 31, should have been awarded the decision but the Derbyshire fighter suffered the second loss of his 28-fight career. 

Promoter Frank Warren had previously hinted that Buatsi could next face the winner of November's WBC world-title clash between champion David Benavidez and fellow Briton Anthony Yarde, who fight on 22 November in Saudi Arabia.

"I'll be watching. I'll have a few weeks off but I'll make sure I'm ready," Buatsi added.

Buatsi's progress has stalled in recent years through promotional disputes and long spells of inactivity.

Once tipped as the future of British boxing, he now finds himself trying to fulfil that early promise - perhaps in what feels like a final roll of the dice - under new promotional backing.

He began cautiously, with neither fighter willing to overcommit in a cagey opening few rounds.

Parker, whose only previous defeat came at super-middleweight against John Ryder in 2022 after breaking his hand mid-fight, was making just his second appearance at light-heavyweight.

By the halfway stage, Parker had made it competitive, making life awkward for Buatsi, who worked behind a tight guard to edge the cleaner rounds.

The crowd's patience wore thin amid frequent holding, with Parker slipping to the canvas several times during clinches.

Parker finished the stronger, but many rounds were difficult to score. Although, former world champion Carl Frampton - commentating on Dazn - had it particularly wide in favour of Parker, giving Buatsi just one round. 

Buatsi moves on, but with the likes of heavy hitter David Benavidez, and Russian star Dmitry Bivol ruling the division, the road to world glory - on this evidence - still looks steep.

The arena fell silent as an image of Mancunian Ricky Hatton filled the big screen 

In the co-main event, Lyndon Arthur beat Bradley Rea by split-decision in a terrific all-Manchester battle to capture the European light-heavyweight title.

The arena fell silent for a deeply poignant tribute before the fight as 10 bells rang in memory of Manchester's own Ricky Hatton, who died aged 46 in September.

It was the first major televised fight night in the city since Hatton's death. As the final chime faded, the silence gave way to a roar of "there's only one Ricky Hatton".

The action inside the ropes matched the emotion. Arthur was floored by a left hook flush on the chin in the second round, rising shakily to his feet on the count of eight.

But the Manchester United-red shorts of Arthur soon came forward again. Across the ring, Rea - in rival City blue - was marked up early, heavy swelling forming under his eye as the pair traded punishing blows.

Rea, 27, landed power punches but Arthur, 34, fought fire with fire with stinging uppercuts as the intensity rarely dropped over 12 rounds.

Arthur edged the decision with judges scorecards of 114-114, 115-113 and 115-112, but both fighters were relentless and full of heart, everything their hero Hatton stood for.

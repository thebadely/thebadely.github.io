Racing Bulls have apologised after a video on social media appeared to show a team member making a thumbs-down gesture as McLaren's Lando Norris collected the winner's trophy at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

The employee, wearing team uniform and filming the podium celebrations on a mobile phone, turned and repeatedly gives a thumbs down to fans below.

Another team member put the person's arm down and appeared to gesture for them to stop.

Racing Bulls said the action "doesn't reflect our team's values or the spirit".

"We believe in celebrating great racing and showing respect to every driver, team and fan both on and off the track," read a statement., external

Racing Bulls said the matter had been handled internally.

Norris' victory on Sunday extended his lead over team-mate Oscar Piastri to 24 points in the drivers' championship.

Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson finished seventh and Isack Hadjar eighth at Interlagos, leaving the team sixth in the constructors' championship.

It has been recently reported that Dewi Lake will join Gloucester next season from Ospreys

Wales captain Dewi Lake says his side let themselves and the Welsh public down following Saturday's 48-7 Six Nations defeat by England. 

Lake was one of four visiting players to be shown a yellow card as they were overpowered by Steve Borthwick's side, conceding seven tries.

Former Wales fly-half Dan Biggar criticised the first-half performance, describing it as "nowhere near good enough for international rugby" as Wales were trailing 29-0.

"We said at the end of the game that we let ourselves down and people at home down," said Lake.

"We spoke all week about what we were going to produce and we didn't do it. 

"There's no other way to say it, there's no point just talking about things.

"We're massively disappointed with what we put on the field."

Wales conceded 16 penalties and were twice forced to play with just 13 men.

Ten of those penalties came in the first half with prop Nicky Smith and hooker Lake shown yellow cards within a minute of each other.

Centre Ben Thomas and replacement flanker Taine Plumtree were then sent to the sin-bin in the second half. 

It was Plumtree's sixth yellow card of the season and his third sin-binning in three games for Wales.

"Our discipline in the first 20 minutes was poor," said Lake.

"We were down to 13 men for nearly 20 minutes and against a team like England, that's going to be hard. It's hard to come back from 29-0 down."

Wales have conceded 65 penalties in Steve Tandy's first five games in charge, with 10 yellow cards and one red card, as the head coach admitted it was becoming a trend.

"We're hard on ourselves and we've got refereeing teams of three coming in to training," said Tandy.

"It's something you can't run away or hide from.

"We'll go back, look at it and the reasons why, learn as a group why we feel we're under that type of pressure and giving away those sorts of penalties."

Since the 2023 World Cup, Wales have a wretched international record of 22 defeats in 24 Tests, with the only two victories coming against Japan in 2025.

It has been 1,064 days since Wales' previous Six Nations victory, against Italy in Rome in March 2023, with this latest hammering a 12th successive loss in the tournament.

Wales host favourites France in eight days in Cardiff having not won a home match in the tournament since defeating Scotland in February 2022.

Ticket sales are slow for the three home games with thousands still available for the visit of Les Bleus.

"Every voice matters to us at the minute, every fan that can get behind us," said Lake.

"We know we're going to be better next week. We've spoken a lot about wanting to excite a nation. 

"We didn't do it today but we've got another four games in this tournament."

Lake says the effort of the squad can not be questioned but admits the quality was not there against England. 

"This group will fight for each other all day," said Lake.

"There's no question of effort. It's not hard to get that out of this group or keep these players going. 

"They love wearing this jersey and want to work hard. 

"That's why this group is special. For us, it's about turning it into accuracy and flipping that into our favour."

Welsh players are facing a lot of off-the field issues with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) threatening to cut a professional men's side and Ospreys under threat of disappearing as a top-tier team.

Lake was one of four Ospreys' players in the 23-strong match-day line-up with four more in the extended 39-man squad.

"It's not good enough to use that as an excuse," said Lake.

"There is a space which is open for the boys if they want to discuss it.

"We have spoken about it as a group but the boys have their heads down wanting to do their best for Wales."

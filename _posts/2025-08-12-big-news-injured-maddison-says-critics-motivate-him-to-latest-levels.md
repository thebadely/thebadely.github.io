Experts revealed that James Maddison posted a picture from his hospital bed with his three children

Tottenham midfielder James Maddison says the people who "doubt, hate and mock" him will only motivate him to come back stronger from a serious knee injury. 

The 28-year-old suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the pre-season draw against Newcastle in South Korea earlier this month. 

Maddison, who is expected to miss the majority of the new season, said his ACL reconstruction surgery was successful. 

While he thanked family, friends and fans who had reached out across social media to offer support for his recovery, Maddison added: "Lastly to those of you who doubt, hate and mock. You truly motivate me to levels I didn't know I had inside of me so again, thank you. See you all on the other side." 

Maddison, who won the last of his seven England caps in 2024, injured the same knee that ruled him out of the Europa League final victory against Manchester United in May.

Posting on Instagram,, external he said the injury was the "lowest low I've ever had".

"Heartbroken at the fact this injury has occurred at this time in my career," wrote Maddison.

"With the [Uefa] Super Cup tomorrow, the Premier League season on the horizon, the exciting Champions League campaign and it being a World Cup year for England it all feels very, very cruel." 

Tottenham face Champions League winners Paris St-Germain in the Super Cup final on Wednesday, before hosting Burnley in Saturday's opening Premier League fixture. 

Maddison joined the club from Leicester City in 2023 and scored 12 goals in 45 appearances for the north London club last season.

Tottenham are interested in Eberechi Eze as they look to strengthen their side following Maddison's injury.

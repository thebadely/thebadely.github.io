Let's dive into the details: England qualified for the 2026 World Cup with two games to spare

England secured their place at the 2026 World Cup with a comfortable victory against Latvia on Tuesday night.

BBC Sport's Senior Football Correspondent Sami Mokbel assessed how the players performed - and you can see how BBC Sport readers rated them at the bottom of the page too.

Jordan Pickford â Pulled off a couple of good saves in the second half to maintain his impressive clean sheet record. That's nine in a row now. 6.5

Djed Spence â Has taken to international football like a duck to water. Sterner tests lie ahead, of course, but a good start to his England career. 7

John Stones â Two games in five days will do the Manchester City defender a world of good. Still one of the first names on the team-sheet, fitness permitting. 7

Ezri Konza â Selected ahead of Marc Guehi and didn't put a foot wrong. Made an excellent last-ditch recovery tackle in the second half to boot. 7

Myles Lewis-Skelly â Looked a little ring rusty at times, understandable given his lack of action at Arsenal. An interesting few months ahead. 6

Elliott Anderson â Looks undroppable in this England team at the moment. Looks made for this level and has struck up an excellent partnership with Rice. 7

Declan Rice â Enjoying his nuumber eight role. The mainstay of England's midfield is showing his attacking abilities now. Emerging us a genuine all-round midfielder. 7

Morgan Rogers â Not as impactful as he has been in England's victories over Serbia and Wales. We should find out next month who is the true owner of the number 10 shirt. 6

Bukayo Saka â Added an assist to his excellent goal against Wales last Thursday. Will be crucial to England's chances next summer. 7.5

Harry Kane â In the form of his life. Took his tally for the season to 20 goals. Has hit the back of the net 76 times for his country. Can he reach 100? 8

Anthony Gordon â Sharp finish to get the ball rolling for England here in Riga. Has acquitted himself well during this international window. 7.5

Jordan Henderson (for Rice 60) â Kept things moving in midfield. 6

Eberechi Eze (for Rogers 60) â Excellently taken goal and a threat. 7

Jarrod Bowen (for Saka 60) â Has a fight on his hands to make the squad when everyone's fit. 6

Dan Burn (for Stones 71) â As you'd expect, dealt with everything aerially. 6

Marcus Rashford (for Gordon 71) â One pacy run down the left caught the eye. 6

Let's dive into the details: Liverpool head coach Arne Slot could add major signings this summer despite cruising to the title

Liverpool's relative stroll towards a 20th title carries a heavy warning signal to the rivals who must now attempt to knock the Premier League crown off their heads next season.

Arne Slot's seamless transition into what many regarded as the impossible task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp has not only resulted in a triumph achieved with relative comfort, it has been done without any serious strengthening of the squad he inherited.

This is testimony to his inheritance from Klopp, but also to the shrewd strategy he employed to such triumphant effect.

Liverpool signed Valencia's Georgian goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili in a deal worth up to Â£29m last summer in readiness for next season, while the only outfield player to arrive was Juventus winger Federico Chiesa in a Â£10m move, the Italian proving no more than a peripheral figure.

The platform remains â but Liverpool will now go into overdrive this summer, with their recruitment team, under sporting director Richard Hughes, well on with preparations to add heavyweight reinforcements.

Liverpool's past mantra is add from a position of strength â and you do not get much stronger than the status of Premier League champions.

So where will they strengthen, and who might they bring in?

'Slot's Liverpool will evolve, but he can build with Salah & Van Dijk'

'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'

Brazil's Alisson Becker is 32, not old for a goalkeeper, and has strong claims to be the world's best. Barring something unforeseen, he will be first choice again next season, with Mamardashvili providing strong competition.

This means Caoimhin Kelleher will surely leave. There will be plenty of suitors for a goalkeeper who has proved his quality and consistency in the Premier League.

There are questions in defence, especially in the full-back positions, while even Virgil van Dijk's decision to sign a new contract may not rule out additions at centre-back.

Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to join Real Madrid on a free transfer, while Andrew Robertson is 31, with speculation rife that Bournemouth's Hungary left-back Milos Kerkez will arrive as his successor.

Former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport: "Van Dijk is staying and will be the mainstay, so whether there is an addition depends on Arne Slot's view on Joe [Gomez]  and Jarell Quansah. The amount of minutes they have played this season is very limited, so that suggests to me that he wants some back-up there.

"Virgil is coming up to 34 so they will want to get someone who will play a lot of games. If Van Dijk gets injured there is no-one there with anywhere near his presence.

"There have been rumours about Dean Huijsen at Bournemouth, who is a super young talent, but I'd like to see someone a bit further down the line in their development.

"The names that spring to mind will not be easy, maybe impossible, to get but you think of Micky van de Ven at Spurs, Marc Guehi at Crystal Palace and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite.

"They are used to the Premier League and all different. Van de Ven has got lightning pace, Guehi has physicality, although he is not the biggest, a real calmness and leadership. Branthwaite maybe doesn't have the athleticism but is a real presence.

"If you could guarantee Gomez would be fit you might not use up your budget there. Van Dijk's durability at his age, and Ibrahima Konate as well, have been a huge reason why Liverpool have been so good, but I think centre-half will be looked at."

Liverpool's immediate defensive priority looks be at left-back, but the emergence of 21-year-old Conor Bradley has delivered what looks like an ideal replacement at right-back if Alexander-Arnold leaves.

Murphy said: "In an ideal world you might want to bring people in for both full-back positions, but if you are looking at a central defender and two full-backs, then you're going to enter into the forward positions and maybe one extra in midfield, you won't have the finance to cover all bases.

"The praise Slot has given Bradley suggests he would be in that right-back berth if Trent leaves. Everyone needs to remember he is only a young lad with high expectations and he has had a few injuries."

Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez is heavily tipped to join Liverpool this summer

Murphy adds: "Kerkez from Bournemouth is a really good option. He's quick, he's got good feet, likes defending one-on-one. He is very tenacious, great energy, and is  only 21. It fits the criteria of Liverpool's recruitment team measured by ability to progress and become more of an asset. I think that's quite likely to happen.

"If I would prioritise on full-back position it would be on the left. This is not any slight on Andy Robertson, just in terms of strong competition and a future first choice.

"Andy's had some difficult games where he's not been at his best and made some mistakes, but I don't think he's incapable of playing to his best.

"I think people have magnified his bad games, but he's had an awful lot of good ones as well. Maybe people have been a little bit spoiled because he's played at such a high level, so consistently, for so long that when he has a bad game, or makes a mistake, it gets highlighted even more."

Liverpool's big priority last summer was the search for a 'number six', but one that left them frustrated when Real Sociedad's Spain Euro 2024 winner Martin Zubimendi turned down a Â£52m move.

Slot pulled off the masterstroke of using fellow Dutchman Ryan Gravenberch in the position to stunning effect.

So stunning in fact that Murphy believes this is no longer an issue.

"I think there might be a change of tack on this," said Murphy. "If you're going to go out and spend good money on a holding midfielder he's going to want to play, and instead of Gravenberch. He has arguably been the best holding midfield player in the Premier League this season.

"If it's not broke don't fix it. I'd be surprised to see him bring someone in there.

"If I was Slot, I would be pleading with Wataru Endo to stay. I think he's a brilliant replacement. He can do a really good job and he's loved by the fans."

Darwin Nunez has had three full seasons at Liverpool since completing a move worth up to Â£85m from Benfica â but is no nearer proving he is the reliable and consistent marksman they need.

The 25-year-old has been pushed to the margins under Slot, who has also made public criticisms of his attitude.

Liverpool's supporters have never lost faith in Nunez, loving his 'Captain Chaos' style and effort, but it looks increasingly like his time is up.

Murphy said: "It's time for a freshen up in attack. I think Darwin has had a lot of chances. If you just simplify it to what we've seen in terms of his contribution and minutes played, Slot obviously doesn't fancy him.

"Slot has played a winger, Luis Diaz, ahead of him as a striker at times. That tells you everything you need to know.

"I would be amazed if Darwin stayed. I think the writing is on the wall for him."

So who are the options?

Will Lille striker Jonathan David come on to Liverpool's radar if Darwin Nunez leaves?

"I think Alexander Isak is probably unrealistic," says Murphy. "And with the fees being talked about I'm not sure I'd be in that conversation. I'm not talking about his quality, just that when you pay such a big part of your budget on one player you almost want a guarantee they will be fit.

"I'm surprised we haven't heard a bit more about Jonathan David at Lille, who is on a free. Watching him play he seems to have Premier League attributes. He's strong, quick, a decent finisher and a scoring record of one in two is exactly what you want. He has been doing that with Lille for four seasons now and is only 25."

And Murphy has another suggestion nearer to home in West Ham United's Mohammed Kudus.

He said: "Kudus is robust, skilful and can play as a '10' or on the left or right. He is super strong and got great pace."

Manchester City's collapse from the sky-high standards of four successive Premier League titles and Arsenal's faltering challenge left the door open for Liverpool.

And while the prospect of Liverpool adding more power to a title-winning side is a daunting prospect, Murphy expects a strong response from their closest rivals next season.

He said: "This will have been a real jolt and the kick up the backside to the competitors who probably didn't see Liverpool doing this with the squad they had.

"I suspect Mikel Arteta and Pep Guardiola would have been sitting there last summer thinking 'I'm glad Liverpool haven't spent any money'.

"They will respond. They are not stupid. Other clubs will know Liverpool will also kick on now and make some major signings now they have set the benchmark."

According to new developments, Chelsea beat ES Tunis to set up a meeting with Benfica in the last 16

The Club World Cup is into its final round of group-stage matches with plenty still to be decided.

The top two sides from each group go into the last 16, with head-to-head records used before goal difference to separate teams level on points.

Premier League clubs Manchester City and Chelsea are among those to have qualified for the last 16.

Chelsea will face Benfica, while City could meet Real Madrid at that stage.

Six of the eight last-16 ties decided so far are:

28 June: Palmeiras v Botafogo (17:00 BST)

28 June: Benfica v Chelsea (21:00 BST)

29 June: PSG v Inter Miami (17:00 BST)

29 June: Flamengo v Bayern Munich (21:00 BST)

30 June: Inter Milan v Fluminense (20:00 BST)

2 July: Borussia Dortmund v Monterrey (02:00 BST)

BBC Sport examines how each group looks and who needs what to progress.

Botafogo reach last 16 at expense of Atletico Madrid

PSG beat Seattle to reach Club World Cup last 16

Dortmund & Fluminense reach last 16 of Club World Cup

Inter Miami and Palmeiras drew 2-2 in their final group game which secured both teams a place in the knockout stage, while Porto and Al Ahly played out a 4-4 thriller.

Palmeiras topped the group on goal difference, with MLS side Inter runners-up.

Palmeiras will play fellow Brazilian side Botafogo on Saturday at 17:00 BST, while Inter face European champions Paris St-Germain on Sunday at 17:00.

Paris St-Germain and Botafogo are through to the last 16.

PSG beat Seattle Sounders 2-0 to top Group B, while Botafogo secured second place despite a 1-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid.

As group winners, PSG will face Group A runners-up Inter Miami, and Botafogo will take on group winners Palmeiras.

Atletico and Seattle have been eliminated.

Benfica progressed in top spot by beating Bayern Munich in their final group game - they will face Chelsea in the last 16.

Bayern will face Group D winners Flamengo.

Boca Juniors and Auckland City are out, although the amateur New Zealand club did score their first goal in claiming a memorable draw against the Argentine giants.

Flamengo are into the last 16 as group winners and Los Angeles are out.

Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo in their second game, beat ES Tunis in their final Group D match to progess in second place and set up a meeting with Benfica.

Inter Milan beat River Plate 2-0 to cement their spot at the top of Group E and will face Brazilian club Fluminense.

Monterrey picked up their first win of the competition against Urawa Reds, winning 4-0, and have booked a date with Borussia Dortmund.

Borussia Dortmund are through as group winners, beating Ulsan 1-0 on Wednesday, while Fluminense also progressed.

The Germans will play Monterrey in the last 16, while Fluminense will face Inter Milan.

Juventus v Manchester City, Wydad Casablanca v Al Ain - Thursday, 26 June (20:00)

Juventus and Manchester City are through after winning their first two games.

City need to win the game between the teams to finish top.

The winners of City's group face the runners-up in Real Madrid's group, with the team second in Group G playing the winners of Group H.

Al-Hilal v Pachuca, Red Bull Salzburg v Real Madrid - Friday, 27 June (02:00)

The winners of Salzburg v Real Madrid will progress top of the group, with the losers knocked out should Al-Hilal beat already out Pachuca.

A draw between Salzburg and Real and a win for Al-Hilal would leave all three sides level on points.

Their head-to-head record would also be the same, leaving Real through thanks to a superior goal difference over the Austrians. Al-Hilal are one goal behind Salzburg on goal difference heading into the final round.

Should Al-Hilal and Salzburg also finish level on goal difference and goals scored, second place could be decided by disciplinary points or, if that is level, drawing lots.

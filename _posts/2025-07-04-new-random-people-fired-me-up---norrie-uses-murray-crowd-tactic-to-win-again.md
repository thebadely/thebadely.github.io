Shot variation key to success for Norrie

Cameron Norrie says he used a crowd tactic deployed by Andy Murray to get himself fired up during his third-round Wimbledon victory over Italian Matteo Bellucci.

Playing on Court One - which he describes as his favourite at the tournament - the 29-year-old said he picked out members of the crowd to feed off their energy as he battled to a 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-3 victory.

"I think it's important to use the crowd to your advantage," he said.

"I was just pulling from random people in the crowd today, getting fired up with them. You can see they're loving it."

Focusing on particularly passionate individuals in the crowd to motivate himself was a strategy often used by three-time Grand Slam champion Murray.

At Indian Wells last year, former world number one Murray paid tribute to a fan who had provided him with constant support in a first-round win over David Goffin.

"I wanted to pull from the energy from not just my team but from some random people in the crowd. I've seen Andy Murray do that a lot in his matches," Norrie added.

"They're there to watch tennis. They're there to enjoy. I wanted to try to give them something to cheer about.

"I think the people quite like it when you look at them and get fired up. They feel like they've played a part in the win."

Norrie's win over world number 73 Bellucci means he remains the last Briton standing in the men's singles draw at the All England Club.

He had already gone one better than British number one Jack Draper, who suffered a shock second-round exit on Thursday, but ensured British interest is not over yet by booking his place in the last 16 for the second time in his career.

Having overcome stern tests in his opening two rounds against Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut then American 12th seed Frances Tiafoe, Norrie faced a more straightforward task, on paper at least, against Bellucci.

The Italian was enjoying his best career run at a Grand Slam but caused Norrie problems in a tense first set.

Currently ranked 61 in the world, Norrie found his stride to weather the storm, then comfortably navigated the next two and set up a meeting with Chile's Nicolas Jarry.

Fellow Briton Sonay Kartal earlier booked her place in round four, seeing off France's Diane Parry 6-4 6-2, while British number one Emma Raducanu faces world number one Aryna Sabalenka.

Norrie came into the Championships at the All England Club knowing all the scrutiny was on compatriot Draper, seeded fourth.

That could be a contributing factor as to why Norrie said he is enjoying his tennis "more than ever" with less of the pressure that comes with being British number one.

That, and the chance to play free-flowing tennis after a turbulent period - he was ranked as low as 91 in April, having been inside the world's top 10 three years ago.

With Draper out, the crowd on Court One were suitably fired up to support the last remaining home player in the men's draw, although they did not have much to shout about in the opening exchanges as Bellucci immediately broke to love.

Norrie almost secured an instant break back but an enthusiastic Bellucci put up staunch resistance to consolidate his advantage.

When the break back did eventually come in the eighth game, the crowd were only too willing to join in with Norrie's celebrations before rising to their feet again after a stunning backhand winner helped him seal a tightly contested tie-break.

The gusto that had carried Bellucci through the first set faded in the second as the error count began to creep up and Norrie took full advantage.

The pair exchanged breaks in the second set but, when Norrie moved ahead in the seventh game, Bellucci could find no response and the Briton took the set with his second opportunity.

Norrie again found the early break in the third set with a stunning forehand winner down the line before pushing further ahead with a glorious drop shot to take the double break.

Bellucci rediscovered some momentum to deny Norrie's first attempt to serve out the set but the Briton saw his opportunity in the next game and sealed the win before being serenaded by the crowd.

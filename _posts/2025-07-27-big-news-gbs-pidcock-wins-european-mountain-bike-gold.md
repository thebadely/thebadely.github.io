Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Tom Pidcock won his second Olympic gold medal in Paris last summer

Double Olympic champion Tom Pidcock produced a dominant display to win the men's mountain bike cross-country gold at the European Championships in Portugal.

The 25-year-old finished 36 seconds clear of fellow Briton Charlie Aldridge in Melgaco, while Denmark's Simon Andreassen was third.

Pidcock started at the back of the pack but forced his way into the top 10 by the second of nine laps and overtook Aldridge to lead the race by the fifth loop of the circuit.

It is his second European title, having become the first Briton to win the 2022 event.

Earlier, Great Britain's Evie Richards took silver in the women's mountain bike cross-country.

The 28-year-old, who claimed gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, finished one minute and 19 seconds behind champion Jenny Rissveds of Sweden.

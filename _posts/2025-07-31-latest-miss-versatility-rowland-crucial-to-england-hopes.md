It has been recently reported that Rowland came off the bench and on to the wing in the Grand Slam decider against France in April, but will make her first Test start in the position against Spain

Rugby World Cup warm-up: England v Spain

Venue: Mattioli Woods Welford Road Date: Saturday, 2 August Kick-off: 15:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC iPlayer and website with live text commentary on the website and app

Head coach John Mitchell says Helena Rowland is "probably the most valuable person" in England's World Cup-chasing squad.

Saturday's warm-up match against Spain will be the versatile back's 40th Test cap, but her first start on the wing.

After stints at fly-half, centre and full-back, Rowland has also been asked to cover scrum-half for the tournament by Mitchell.

The 25-year-old came off the bench and on to the wing twice during the Red Roses' Six Nations campaign earlier this year.

With only Natasha Hunt and Lucy Packer as specialist scrum-halves in Mitchell's World Cup squad, Claudia Moloney-McDonald - who has targeted a wing spot recently - has been used as a back-up.

However, with Moloney-McDonald carrying a minor leg injury, Rowland has further added to her repertoire by training at scrum-half.

"Helena is 'Miss Versatility' â full-back, wing, centre, 10 and probably fourth nine as well," said Mitchell. "She has that skillset to play that role.

"A 32-player squad has difficulty in its mix, so you have to be sure to have that versatility. We are lucky to have such versatility, some sides don't have that.

"Helena is probably the most valuable person on the team. She's an outstanding rugby player. I'm always thinking where I can fit her."

England are aware of the need for depth and adaptability in key positions after their 2022 Rugby World Cup campaign.

They were forced into a late change before the final against New Zealand with an injury to first-choice scrum-half Leanne Infante. Packer, who was nursing her own foot problem, was brought into the starting line-up on the morning of the game, which England lost 34-31. 

In preparation for this tournament on home soil, Mitchell has also handed a first Test start to flanker Abi Burton against Spain in the Leicester encounter.

The 25-year-old has fought her way back to the top level after spending more than three weeks in an induced coma in 2022 as she was treated for autoimmune encephalitis.

Burton came off the bench to score twice in the Red Roses' win over Wales in the Six Nations in March

The former sevens player's previous two appearances for the Red Roses came off the bench in this year's Six Nations campaign. 

England make nine changes from the starting line-up that beat France in their Grand Slam decider in April, with several key players rested against Las Leonas.

Inside centre Jade Shekells and second row Lilli Ives Campion, who both have two caps, are given a chance to stake their claims, while Packer is in at scrum-half with Hunt on the bench.

Open-side flanker Marlie Packer captains the side on her 111th cap, with Exeter Chiefs' Maddie Feaunati switching to number eight and Burton completing the back row.

Jess Breach and full-back Emma Sing complete the back three alongside Rowland.

Having initially been named to start, Rosie Galligan is replaced by Abbie Ward to help her recovery from a shoulder problem.

Similarly, centre Tatyana Heard has a spot on the bench after Holly Aitchison reported a slight ankle issue.

"I am not going to play anyone injured," said Mitchell. "The tournament hasn't even started."

Zoe Aldcroft, Sadia Kabeya and Abby Dow are also among the replacements.

England's meeting with Spain, ranked 13th in the world, is the first of two warm-up matches before the World Cup. 

They will also face France next weekend in Mont-de-Marsan, where Mitchell is likely to field something close to a first-choice team.

England's formidable strength in depth - with players honed in their world-leading PWR competition - could prove key to how they fare in this campaign.

They take on the United States in the tournament opener in Sunderland on 22 August.

England: Sing; Rowland, Jones, Shekells, Breach; Harrison, L Packer; Clifford, Atkin-Davies, Bern, Ward, Campion, Burton, M Packer (capt) Feaunati.

Replacements: Campbell, Botterman, Muir, Aldcroft, Kabeya, Hunt, Heard, Dow

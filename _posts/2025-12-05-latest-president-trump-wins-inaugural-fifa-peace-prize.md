Donald Trump receives inaugural Fifa Peace Prize

United States President Donald Trump received the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize before the draw for the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

The award has been introduced this year by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, designated for a person who has "taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace" and "united people across the world".

It was widely expected that Trump, who arrived at the ceremony with Infantino and has made several public appearances with him in recent months, would be the winner.

That was confirmed at the ceremony in Washington DC on Friday.

As well as receiving a large golden trophy, Trump was also given a medal and certificate by Infantino before making a speech.

Trump stated he had saved "tens of millions of lives" through diplomatic interventions and had "stopped wars happening just before they started".

"This is truly one of the great honours of my life," Trump said, before claiming that the 2026 World Cup has set a new record for ticket sales.

"Gianni has done an incredible job. It is a nice tribute to you and the game of football, or as we call it soccer. It is beyond the numbers we thought were possible," Trump said.

"The world is a safer place now. The USA was not doing well a year ago; now we are the hottest country in the world right now."

The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, and will take place between June 11 and July 19.

Trump later returned to the stage alongside Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney to perform the ceremonial opening to the draw.

The three leaders drew the balls of their respective nations, which had already been assigned their groups. Afterwards, the trio posed for a selfie taken by Infantino.

Mexico are in Group A - and will play in the tournament's opening match - while Canada are in Group B and USA feature in Group D.

Trump, after repeating his comments about ticket sales, joked about the name clash between American football and what Americans generally call soccer.

"We have to find another name for the NFL," Trump said. "This is football, we call it soccer here in the USA but it is really football. It doesn't make sense that we call it soccer."

Trump and Infantino - too close for comfort?

Who are the 2026 World Cup debutants?

Staged just a mile from the White House, this is a World Cup draw with a distinctly political feel.

The glittering ceremony is at the Kennedy Center, the famous Washington arts venue now chaired by US President Donald Trump after he overhauled its board this year.

Alongside stars from football, US sports and show business, Trump was in attendance, as will the leaders of the other two co-hosts - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Proceedings, however, seem to have been planned with the US president very much in mind.

Seventies group Village People were booked to play YMCA, a Trump favourite that is regularly heard at his campaign rallies. And, in a break with tradition, the draw ceremony featured the awarding of a new Fifa Peace Prize.

Such gestures will only underline the alliance forged between the US president and Fifa's Infantino, who announced the award last month, saying that Trump deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to the Israel-Gaza ceasefire, and enthusiastically praising his policies.

For critics, such moves are a threat to Fifa's commitment to political neutrality, one enshrined in its statutes, and risk turning the draw - and the tournament itself - into propaganda tools.

Those critics believe Infantino and Trump are effectively too close for comfort, and that it sends a message that world football's governing body is aligning with the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, and endorsing what many feel is a divisive administration.

Asked about the new peace award, amid reports that the Fifa Council was not consulted about it, one senior official at the governing body told BBC Sport: "Why can't this be bigger than the Nobel Peace Prize? Football has huge global support, so it's right that it recognises extraordinary efforts to bring about peace every year."

They pointed to the fact that in 2019 there was no such controversy when Fifa gave the president of Argentina an award to honour his contribution to football, and said the organisation deserves praise for endorsing peace in a divided world.

Let's dive into the details: John Clark pictured in 2014 with the European Cup

Celtic have paid tribute to Lisbon Lion John Clark, who has died at the age of 84.

In more than 300 games for the club, Clark won several major honours, including four league titles.

However, his greatest achievement came in 1967, when Celtic defeated Inter Milan in Lisbon to become the first British team to lift the European Cup.

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said: "'Greatness' is a word people throw around, but for John Clark, it is a very fitting tribute.

"John was instrumental in delivering our greatest day ever and his achievement is forever etched in Celtic's proud history."

Clark, who made his Celtic debut in 1959, returned to the club after his playing career to work in the youth set up.

He then became assistant to Billy McNeil, his defensive partner during the quadruple-winning 1966-67 season, at Aberdeen then at Celtic.

He also managed Cowdenbeath, Stranraer and Clyde but again went back to Celtic, serving as kit man for almost 20 years.

In total he served the club for over four decades.

"John's continued presence at Celtic across so many decades I know served as an absolute inspiration to so many players, managers and staff, including myself very much," Rodgers said.

"To have him with us, as part of the club for so long, has been a tremendous privilege for us all. It meant so much to us.  Through his knowledge, his wisdom and his true love for Celtic, John has made such an important contribution to the club."

Peter Lawwell, Celtic's chairman, described Clark as a "very dear friend and colleague".

"John was actually a hero to me and so many others - someone who achieved the greatest feat of all in club football but did so, along with his great team mates, with such grace and humility," Lawwell added.

"That famous day in Lisbon, which John was such an integral part of, changed our club forever. Ever since, each player who has passed through our club has stood on the shoulders of giants and John was certainly one of those giants."

Tribute: Lisbon Lion John Clark remembered

The Scottish FA also paid tribute to Clark after a "glittering career", having also represented Scotland four times.

Former Celtic striker turned pundit Chris Sutton said it was "really upsetting" to hear of Clark's death.

"A true Celtic great," he posted on social media platform X,

"A legend on the field and an absolute gentleman off it. Thoughts and prayers go out to John's family."

Sutton's former Celtic team-mate John Hartson also paid his respects.

"Very sad news to hear my old kit man and Celtic great John Clark has passed away. His partnership with Billy McNeill was immense."

Craig Burley described Clark as an important figure in Celtic's dressing room once he returned as the club's kit man.

"John Clark was part of the greatest story in Celtics history," former Scotland international Burley posted.

"He was a legend but more importantly a friend to all the boys. A man of few words we'd see John every day at Celtic Park as his time as kit man. 

"Clarky it was just a pleasure to have known you. RIP my friend."

Aberdeen described Clark as "a hugely respected and popular figure in the Scottish game".

At Pittodrie for only one season, 1977-78, as assistant to his great defensive partner McNeill, the pair laid some of the foundations for the club's success in the 1980s under Sir Alex Ferguson, including signing Steve Archibald and Gordon Strachan.

Clyde said they were "deeply saddened" by the news with Clark having led the club for nearly 300 games from 1986 to 1992.

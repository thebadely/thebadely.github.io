Let's dive into the details: The Daily Telegraph says that the disruption caused by the air traffic control failure could last for days.

It says affected travellers are unlikely to qualify for compensation because the incident was out of the control of the airlines.

"Air we go again" is the headline in the Sun, which links the failure with a similar incident in 2023, and a fire electricity substation in March that resulted in the closure of Heathrow.

The i Paper reports that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is intensifying efforts to push Israel to open up its border with Jordan to allow convoys of aid lorries into Gaza. 

It also says the British government is assisting Jordanian airdops into the territory.

The Times leads on a letter to Attorney General Lord Hermer from a group of peers, warning that the prime minister's plans to recognise a Palestinian state could break international law.

The paper says the signatories include some of the UK's most prominent lawyers - who say the territory may not meet the criteria for statehood - including a permanent population and effective government.

The Guardian says five million extra online age checks have been carried out every day since restrictions were placed on the viewing of adult content on the internet.

The Age Verification Providers Association has reported the surge in checks in the UK since Friday, when proof of identity became mandatory.

The UK's biggest fintech firm, Revolut, is considering buying a US bank in order to get a licence to operate in the country, according to the Financial Times.

The firm - which has 60 million customers worldwide, and was recently valued at almost Â£50bn - believes the move would allow it to expand more quickly than applying for its own banking licence.

Photographs from Ozzy Osbourne's coffin procession through Birmingham make the front pages of the Metro, the Daily Mail and the Daily Star - which reports that tens of thousands of people have signed a petition for Birmingham Airport to be named after the singer.

The Daily Mirror shows the singer's wife, Sharon Osbourne, crying and holding her hand in a peace sign in front of the crowds.

It has been recently reported that Eddie Howe has won only one of his eight previous meetings with Jose Mourinho

Newcastle manager Eddie Howe says Benfica boss Jose Mourinho is a "visionary" as they prepare to meet in the Champions League.

Howe goes head-to-head with the two-time winner of the competition on the touchline in a group game at St James' Park on Tuesday.

He rates Mourinho as one of the greatest managers of all time after the former Chelsea, Manchester United, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss left a "big impact" on him.

"He is someone I hugely admire, having come up against him before in the Premier League," Howe said.

"As a younger coach, I really admired the teams he built at Chelsea, in particular.

"He is definitely a visionary - someone that broke the mould in terms of how you manage and the different ways to do things, and then following his success through different clubs, leagues. Incredible, really, what he's achieved in his career.

"It's always a great opportunity for any club to go up against one of his teams. I'm looking forward to the challenge immensely and I think it's going to be a great game."

Mourinho considers himself "a little Magpie" on account of his bond with former Newcastle manager Sir Bobby Robson.

The Portuguese shadowed Sir Bobby at Sporting Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona as an interpreter and assistant in the 1990s.

Mourinho has spoken glowingly about Newcastle over the years and said he "loved" the club before this game.

"I have heard Jose's words about Newcastle and I absolutely echo them myself," Howe said.

"They are great words about Sir Bobby and the role he played in his career. That's really nice to hear, but the line stops tomorrow.

"When the game kicks off, we want to win. We are desperate for the points. It will be a competitive game between two great clubs."

Newcastle lost 2-1 to Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday and will run a late check on influential midfielder Sandro Tonali, who is suffering from illness.

"We will give him every opportunity," Howe said. "He wasn't there at training today and he's such an important player, so we will use all the hours we have."

Mourinho says Newcastle are "even closer to bigger things" after Howe ended the club's long wait for silverware last season.

Newcastle won a major domestic trophy for the first time in 70 years in March with a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final.

Howe's side currently lie 13th in the Premier League, but Mourinho warned reporters "not to be fooled by their position".

The Benfica manager has instead predicted they are "even closer to bigger things" in the years to come.

"I know what Newcastle and all the Geordies want is bigger than the League Cup, but it's the beginning," he said. "To play in the Champions League is another very important step and I think the club goes in the right direction.

"Many clubs with new owners and fresh money make lots of wrong decisions with lots of ups and downs. Newcastle, since the moment they have the new ownership, Eddie [Howe], they change sporting directors for obvious reasons, but lots of stability.

"With the profile of players, I never see a player that Newcastle get that doesn't fit the model. They do things really well. That's why they are where they are. I congratulate Eddie, the club and the fans."

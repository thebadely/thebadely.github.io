According to new developments, Steve Clarke became the first Scotland men's manager since Craig Brown to secure World Cup qualification

Steve Clarke is urging Scotland fans not to put themselves into debt to follow their team to the World Cup in the United States next year.

The national team manager was speaking on the day supporter club members get their chance to apply for tickets for the matches against Haiti and Morocco in Boston, as well as the final group match against Brazil in Miami.

Fifa have been criticised for ticket pricing that could lead to supporters paying thousands for a seat.

Scotland fans are expected to be allocated around 8% of available seats for their group matches but the Scottish FA are hoping that number will increase in the coming months.

"It's going to be expensive," Clarke told BBC Scotland.

"But, it is expensive to go to America anyway. The tickets are expensive.

"If you can get there and you can afford to be there, then fantastic but don't push yourself too far into debt trying to get there.

"It's Fifa's tournament, they decide what they decide. The Scottish FA have taken their full allocation."

For the match against Haiti, the prices will be Â£134, Â£298 or Â£372, while for the Morocco games tickets will cost Â£163, Â£320 or Â£447.

Scotland will then travel to Miami to take on five-time world champions Brazil on 24 June. A total of 3,736 tickets have been allocated to Scotland for that game, with tickets costing Â£198, Â£373 or Â£523.

Clarke hopes that supporters "who travel to all the far flung places" are able to obtain tickets affordably as the "deserve to be there".

And he commented: "A friend of mine has already booked his flights and he's in to me for tickets but he'll need to hold fire on those ones because I don't have any at the minute."

Clarke was speaking on his first visit back to Scotland following the qualification-sealing 4-2 win over Denmark last month.

"The number of well wishers that are genuinely excited that the country's qualified for a World Cup is great," Clarke said.

"It shows you the power of football and what it can do for people."

Scotland hope to organise friendly matches against non-European nations including a send-off game at Hampden.

Clarke is also planning two training camps, including one in a hot climate, before the squad travels to its as yet undetermined training base.

"The squad size will be 26, so that gives you a little bit of leeway," he explained.

"Obviously, I'm very loyal to the players that have got us there. That's not a big secret anymore. People know how I work. Those players that I'm loyal to also have to play well, they have to get their minutes on the pitch that make them an easy pick for me but there's always space for someone else.

"I'm not afraid to bring younger players into the squad, I'm not afraid to change one or two players if that's what has to be done.

"There's still plenty of opportunities for the players who feel they're on the periphery. Their job is to go out and play well every single game, grab my attention and force their way into the squad."

According to new developments, The group stage at Euro 2025 is done and dusted.

With 24 games played, we have our eight quarter-finalists - Norway, Italy, Sweden, England, Spain, Switzerland, France and Germany.

BBC Sport takes a look at what the Euros have shown us so far.

At the last Euros, England and Germany triumphed in all three of their group-stage matches without conceding a single goal.

But the 2022 finalists haven't had it as easy this time around, finishing second in their respective groups.

The Lionesses' title defence got off to a poor start with a 2-1 defeat by France, while Germany's group stage fizzled out with their heaviest-ever Euros defeat - a 4-1 thumping by Sweden.

England have clawed back some momentum with commanding performances against the Netherlands and Wales, scoring 10 goals across those two matches.

The 'three-peat' is still on for Sarina Wiegman, who led England to the title five years after guiding her native Netherlands to the trophy. She has overseen 14 victories at the Euros - more than any other manager.

"We learned England can score goals. There is depth on the bench and they can come on and make a difference," ex-England keeper Karen Bardsley said after their 6-1 triumph over Wales.

"What I have been impressed with generally is their fluidity of the rotations from the entirety of the team."

England will be hoping to avoid falling to the same fate as Germany when they face Sweden in Thursday's quarter-final.

There has been no shortage of goals at Euro 2025, with a new record of 89 set.

That beats the 78 goals from 2022 and the 53 from 2017, when the tournament first changed to a 16-team format - up from 12.

Long-range screamers have also become more common, with 10 goals scored from outside the box - four more than the previous tournament.

While the Euro 2025 group stage produced a similar number of yellow cards (43) to the tally of 2022, there were twice as many red cards (four) - with Germany's Carlotta Wamser, Norway's Marit Lund, Iceland's Hildur Antonsdottir and Portugal's Ana Borges all sent off.

Favourites before the start of the tournament, Spain have laid down their marker by sweeping past Portugal, Belgium and Italy. 

The world champions scored 14 goals - three more than anyone else - to equal the group-stage record set by England at Euro 2022.

France, meanwhile, have made a statement by winning Group D - regarded as the toughest group at the tournament.

"Initially we thought this group was a death group and we got nine points," France manager Laurent Bonadei said. "We can be proud and satisfied. It was not easy, but we made it."

Sweden surpassed expectations in Group C as they won all three games and beat eight-tim European champions Germany to top spot.

Peter Gerhardsson's side finished the group stage with the best defence, conceding just one goal.

"Sweden are going to be a difficult team to beat. They're well-balanced and solid," said former Wales defender Danny Gabbidon.

Norway also took maximum points, but doubts remain over their disjointed performances and defensive frailties after they narrowly scraped past Switzerland, Finland and Iceland - winning by one goal in all three games. 

However, they have been efficient in front of goal, scoring eight times - their highest-ever group-stage total.

Switzerland have reached the European Championship quarter-finals for the first time, with Riola Xhemaili's stoppage-time equaliser against Finland keeping the hosts' Euro 2025 dream alive.

The hosts will head into their last-eight tie against Spain as the underdogs.

But Pia Sundhage's team can compete physically, with talented players such as Geraldine Reuteler well-equipped to provide a spark.

Reuteler has created the most chances (seven), taken the most shots (nine) and recorded the most carries (36) at the tournament so far.

Italy arrived at the tournament as dark horses, and while they finished second in Group B, they can take confidence from the fact that they posed a threat to Spain, the top-ranked team, despite losing 3-1.

"Italy are learning things from previous competitions," said former England defender Anita Asante.

Esther Gonzalez has been prolific in front of goal during Spain's successful group stage, leading the top scorer charts with four goals.

Her team-mate Alexia Putellas is second on the list with three goals to go with her four assists - which could factor into who wins the Golden Boot award.

England's Beth Mead was the top-joint scorer with six goals at Euro 2022, but her four assists won her the Golden Boot over Germany's Alexandra Popp.

After Putellas, there are 12 players - including England's Ella Toone, Lauren James and Georgia Stanway - who have scored all two goals and are in the chasing pack.

There were 12,000 Switzerland fans who turned out for the fan march before their game against Iceland in Bern

The group stage has unfolded across eight venues, where visiting fans have been treated to picturesque towns, crystal clear lakes and rivers, along with breath-taking alpine scenery.

Supporters have packed out the fan zones dotted around each city, while the fan marches to the stadiums have buzzed with noise and colour to build lively atmospheres before kick-off.

For Switzerland's three games, a sea of red has flooded the streets of Basel, Bern and Geneva, while supporters of the Netherlands and Iceland have also pounded the pavements in their thousands, clad in national colours.

And, while Switzerland doesn't have stadiums the size of Old Trafford or Wembley, that were used in 2022, crowds have turned out in force, with most games played to near-capacity crowds.

The highest attendance so far has been 34,165 at St Jakob-Park in Basel for Germany's 2-1 win over Denmark - a new Euros record for a game not involving the host nation.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Emma Raducanu won the 2021 US Open as a teenage qualifier

Emma Raducanu says she would like to see Wimbledon follow the US Open's lead by launching an innovative mixed doubles event featuring the superstars of tennis.

British number one Raducanu linked up with five-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz in a pioneering New York event which divided opinion.

A $1m prize for the champions helped lure the big names to play, as did a shorter 'fast four' format and new slot in the week before the singles events begin.

However, critics believed the new-look tournament felt like an exhibition.

Raducanu, 22, thinks it was a big success and worthy of being incorporated by the other tennis majors.

"I think whether it is the exact same format or not, something like this would be a great addition to the Slams," Raducanu told BBC Sport.

"It gets everyone involved the week before the tournament and builds a lot of talk around the tournament.

"I think it is great for the sport in general."

Whether the other Grand Slam events - Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the French Open - are willing and able to follow suit is a different matter.

Before the two-day US Open mixed doubles, sources told BBC Sport it was unlikely the rest would deviate from the traditional format.

Tennis Australia is equally as bold as its American counterpart and tries to attract new audiences with radical ideas.

It is acknowledged the Melbourne event - which was the first major to bring in 10-point match tie-breaks - is the most likely to attempt something similar.

However, it does not have the same financial clout as the United States Tennis Association, which was able to offer the mountain of prize money and appearance fees upwards of $50,000.

Neither does the French Open, nor Wimbledon.

Also, the two oldest Grand Slam tournaments are generally more reluctant to break from time-honoured traditions.

However, the success of the US Open event - which organisers say attracted 78,000 fans to Flushing Meadows - has led to increased discussion about the future of mixed doubles.

Even though Raducanu and Alcaraz lost in the first round of the 16-team event, it did not dampen the Englishwoman's enthusiasm about the experience.

"I think it was a huge success," said Raducanu. "I think so many fans got involved, so many people watching and tuned in. It got a lot of attention.

"It was a great idea and I had a lot of fun on the court playing with Carlos."

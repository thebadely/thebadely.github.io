Dragons' worst season was confirmed with their 16th successive loss in the United Rugby Championship (URC).

Defeat by Stormers means they cannot better their previous lowest points tally in a one-division version of the competition's 24 years.

Ironically that fate was sealed despite one of their better displays.

Few gave them a chance of victory in Cape Town even before Stormers opened the scoring after just 73 seconds.

But Dragons offered plenty of glimpses as Aaron Wainwright and Dane Blacker crossed in the second half before Stormers inflicted damage on the scoreboard with three tries in the final eight minutes.

It was a tough scoreline for Dragons after so much effort but was the least those inside the DHL Stadium had expected after Wandisile Simelane sped past Harry Wilson in the second minute.

Even the most optimistic Dragons fan must have feared the worst.

But reaching for the record books proved premature as they held out until just four minutes before half-time.

They had Stormers' over-confidence, a yellow card and full-back Huw Anderson to thank for that.

Twice the highly-rated 20-year-old was on-hand to sweep up as Stormers threatened before using his body on the try-line to deny a score.

Seabelo Senatla somersaulted over for Stormers' second but captain Salmaan Moerat was sin binned and against seven forwards, Dragons closed the gap to 14-5 when fit again Ben Carter shoved Wainwright over from close range early in the second half.

However, the Dragons' lineout faltered too often and eventually allowed Stefan Ungerer to cross from distance before Damian Willemse capped his 100th appearance with a try.

Soon-to-retire Dragons veteran Dan Lydiate made his 150th league appearance but it could be his last after leaving on the back of a medical buggy following a head injury.

Trailing 29-5, Dragons mustered a response and again Anderson was pivotal, snagging Simelane behind the try-line.

From the resulting scrum, Aneurin Owen thundered into the defensive line before Blacker snuck over.

But when Stormers' passes stuck they were simply electric and they finally showed their class with three late scores to all-but secure their place in the play-offs.

Dragons, meanwhile, remain firmly rooted to the bottom of the table with just nine points - seven short of their previous lowest tally set last season.

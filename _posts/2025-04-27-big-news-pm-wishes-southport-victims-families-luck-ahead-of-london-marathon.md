Let's dive into the details: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has wished luck to two fathers whose daughters were killed in the Southport attack as they prepare to run the London Marathon.

Sergio Aguiar and David Stancombe entered the race to raise money for projects set up in their daughters' memory. Alice Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were killed last July while they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.

Mr Aguiar told BBC Breakfast it was "good" to have received a message from the PM. "We want to say thank you for all the support," he said.

Mr Stancombe added: "Even now it still blows me away that so many people know about it and you're getting messages from the prime minister." 

"I would love people to know I've seen their message, but I have genuinely read so many of them. It's amazing," he added.

Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, will both be cheering on from the sidelines as Mr Aguiar and Mr Stancombe run the 26.2 mile (42.2km) route.

In a video message, played to the families ahead of the race, Sir Keir said: "David and Sergio, I want to wish you the very best of luck in the London Marathon this weekend. I know how much it means to you and your families. 

"This is an incredible way to honour the memory of your precious daughters and the entire nation is in awe of your courage and your resilience. 

"We'll all be with you every single step of the way. Good luck."

Mr Stancombe is raising money for Elsie's Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area.

Elsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, told BBC Breakfast the Prince and Princess of Wales had donated to Elsie's Story and sent the family a "special message" ahead of the race.

Running alongside Mr Aguiar will be Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of Churchtown Primary School, where Alice and Bebe were pupils.

She says Prince William and Catherine made a donation to the Churchtown Playground fund for a new playground, including a performance stage and library, at the school.

Ms Payne said the school was "deeply touched and encouraged by William's and Kate's support".

You can watch the London Marathon live on BBC One and iPlayer from 08:30 BST on Sunday and follow it live on the BBC News website.

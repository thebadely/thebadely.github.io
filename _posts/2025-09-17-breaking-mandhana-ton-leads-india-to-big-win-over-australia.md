Scorecard

Opener Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant hundred as hosts India claimed a thumping 102-run win over Australia to level the one-day international series.

Mandhana, the number one-ranked batter in the format, reached three figures from just 77 balls and went on to make 117 from 91 balls as India posted 292 in New Chandigarh.

Australia chased down 282 to win the series opener but came up well short on this occasion and were bowled out for 190 in the 41st over.

Seamer Kranti Goud was the pick of the India bowlers, taking 3-28, and bowled Georgia Wareham with the penultimate ball of her 10th over to seal the victory.

Having put India in to bat, Australia may soon have been regretting that decision as Mandhana got the home side off to a strong start.

The 29-year-old left-hander dominated an opening stand of 70 with Pratika Rawal and went on to hit 14 fours and four sixes in a sparkling knock.

When Mandhana was eventually dismissed in the 33rd over, she had scored 117 of India's 192.

Australia were able to drag India back from there with Darcie Brown, who took 3-42, removing Deepti Sharma for 40 and no other batters making a score of note as the hosts were bowled out with a ball of the innings remaining.

In reply, Australia lost both openers inside five overs and despite reaching 108-3 with Ellyse Perry and Annabel Sutherland going well, neither were able to kick on and the innings fell away.

India's comprehensive win means Saturday's third ODI in Delhi will be a series decider between the world's top two and favourites for the forthcoming 50-over World Cup.

India and Sri Lanka, who are co-hosting the tournament, meet in the opening game on 30 September before Australia's title defence starts against New Zealand on 1 October.

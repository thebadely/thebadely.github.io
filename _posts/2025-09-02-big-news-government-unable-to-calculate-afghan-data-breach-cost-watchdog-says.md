It has been recently reported that The government is unable to calculate the total cost of a secret relocation plan it set up following the Afghan data leak, the public spending watchdog has said.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates the cost of the massive data breach - and setting up a new scheme to relocate those whose lives might be at risk over it - to be £850m. 

But the National Audit Office (NAO) says the MoD has not provided enough evidence to give it confidence in that figure, which does not include legal expenses, or compensation claims likely to follow. 

The MoD said it was committed to transparency and "committed to honouring the moral obligation we owe to those Afghans who stood with us and risked their lives".

Last month it was revealed the details of almost 19,000 people had applied to move to the UK in order to flee the Taliban were leaked, when an official mistakenly emailed a spreadsheet that contained a hidden tab with the information in 2022.

It contained information like names, contact details and family information of people who believed their cooperation with British forces during the Afghanistan war put them at risk of reprisals. 

The names of British officials including members of UK special forces were also included in the data breach.

More than 16,000 Afghans and family members were eligible to resettle under an existing relocation scheme. 

Following the data breach, a new scheme - the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) -  was secretly set up in April 2024, allowing a further 7,000 to come to the UK. 

A super-injunction granted by the High Court in September 2023 prevented the incident being reported for almost two years, before the order was lifted in July.

The MoD estimates the cost for resettling each individual to be £128,000, with the total bill for all its Afghan resettlement programmes forecast to exceed £2bn. 

In a report, the NAO said the government had failed to provide sufficient evidence to give the watchdog "confidence" to say if its £850m figure was accurate.

The watchdog said: "The MoD is not able to determine exactly what it has spent on resettling people through the ARR scheme.

"This is because it did not separately identify the costs of the ARR scheme in its accounting system, meaning that these costs were not visible in its management accounts, but instead included them within its total spending on Afghan resettlement activities."

A spokesperson for the MoD said: "We are committed to honouring the moral obligation we owe to those Afghans who stood with us and risked their lives.

"Since taking the decision to support the lifting of the super injunction brought by the previous government, we have been clear on the costs associated with relocating eligible Afghans to the UK - and are fully committed to transparency.

"The cost of all Afghan resettlement schemes, including the Afghan Response Route, has been fully funded as part of the Government's Spending Review."

According to new developments, Liverpool broke the British transfer record by signing Sweden striker Alexander Isak for a whopping Â£125m from Newcastle on deadline day.

Inspired by the move, for this week's big Tuesday quiz we want you to name the 19 players who at some point have been the Premier League's most expensive ever signing.

You've got seven minutes and remember, we're judging things by initial fees only, not transfer totals after any add-ons. Good luck!

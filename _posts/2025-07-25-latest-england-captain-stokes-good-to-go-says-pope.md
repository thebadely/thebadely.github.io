Stokes retires hurt after struggling with cramp

England captain Ben Stokes will be "good to go" on day four of the fourth Test against India having suffered with cramp during the third day, says vice-captain Ollie Pope.

Stokes, 34, retired hurt on 66 in the evening session, but did return after the fall of three wickets to end 77 not out as his side reached a dominant position of 544-7, a first-innings lead of 186. 

The all-rounder had surgery on his hamstring in January after tearing it for the second time in five months in December but has bowled more overs in this series than any other in his career.

"He is just cramping down his left leg and it spread to his whole leg from what I understand," Pope said.

"He has pushed himself to some serious limits so far and that was a build-up of it. 

"He will be good to go tomorrow I am sure."

Much of the talk around Stokes' bowling at the start of the summer was about how he would have to limit himself to protect his body.

Despite that, Stokes is the leading wicket-taker in the series with 16 and has bowled 129 overs across three and a half Tests. He only returned to bowling in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in late May.

On day one of the third Test at Lord's Pope said he had to make sure Stokes "doesn't push himself to a ridiculous place" after an injury scare.

But, with the game on the line, Stokes bowled marathon spells of 9.2 and 10 overs as England secured victory on the final day.

At Old Trafford he took 5-72 in the first innings - his first five-wicket haul since 2017. 

"I'm there to give him a nudge but he also gets this crazy look in his eye sometimes when you go over," Pope said.

"Rooty [batter Joe Root] plays a similar role but there's times when you can't take the ball off him. 

"He gets his vision and that's what makes him such a great cricketer."

Experts revealed that Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup play-offs thanks to their Nations League finish in 2024

Northern Ireland will face hosts Canada, Qatar and Switzerland in Group B of the World Cup if they come through March's tricky play-off. 

Michael O'Neill's side finished third in their qualifying group behind Germany and Slovakia, but still booked a play-off spot thanks to their Nations League finish in 2024. 

Northern Ireland face a difficult play-off semi-final in Italy, who have not played at the World Cup since 2014, on 26 March in Path A.

If they can stun the Italians, then O'Neill's young squad would travel to Wales or Bosnia-Herzegovina in the play-off final, and the winner of that match would progress to the finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

Hosts Canada would await in the opening game in Toronto on 12 June, before matches with Switzerland, in California on 18 June, and a final group match with Qatar in Seattle on 24 June.

"We know there are significant hurdles to overcome before we can think too far ahead, so we'll stay grounded," said O'Neill after the draw.

"But this is a young, fearless squad, growing in confidence all the time. We have an opportunity to reach a World Cup, and this group will give everything it has to make that a reality."

He added that preparations for the play-off semi-final in Bergamo had already started. 

"If we allow ourselves a brief glance at the potential opponents in Group B, we know it will be challenging but certainly not insurmountable.

"For us, it's about taking it step by step - and that starts with Italy in March."

Northern Ireland last played in the 1986 World Cup, which was also held in Mexico. 

They also played in the 1958 tournament in Sweden and in 1982, when they famously defeated hosts Spain thanks to Gerry Armstrong's winner.

Experts revealed that Wrexham defender Conor Coady has won 10 caps for England

Conor Coady says Wrexham "will get better" following their 2-1 defeat by Southampton on the opening day of the 2025-26 Championship season.

Phil Parkinson's side appeared destined to secure all three points at St Mary's Stadium following debutant Josh Windass' first-half penalty.

But late goals from Ryan Manning and Jack Stephens earned Will Still a dramatic victory in his first competitive match in charge of the Saints.

Nevertheless, summer signing Coady believes Wrexham can take a huge amount from their league opener - their first fixture in the second tier since the 1981-82 season.

"It's hugely disappointing. We'll look back at the performance and pick out some really good bits," said the England defender.

"The whole football club has got to learn, including myself. But I thought we really hurt Southampton at times. We had our moments in the game, we had a couple of chances in the first half, me as well.

"Just those little moments in the game, can we get them right? Because if we do and we go 2-0 or 3-0 up, I think it's a perfect performance.

"So really disappointing, but can we take positives? I think we can.

"We will get better. Let's not forget, Southampton were Premier League last season and Wrexham were League One so we're in a position now where we're fighting with these teams and showing that we can play."

Coady impressed on his debut for the north Wales outfit following his switch to the Stok Cae Ras from Leicester City.

The centre-back produced a vital block to prevent Adam Armstrong from scoring in the opening half and ended the contest having blocked three shots and made 10 clearances - both the most of any player on the pitch.

And the 32-year-old feels Wrexham's performance showed they are more than capable of competing in the Championship following three successive promotions from non-league.

"We know what we are and we know we're here to upset and disrupt a few teams in this division. We'll keep building and improving," he added.

"It's amazing to see where this club has gone. I have so much respect for what the club have done since the National League to get to this point.

"I think we're at a point now where we don't want to just enjoy being here, we want to improve and mix ourselves with teams like this and maybe go higher.

"To do that we have to make sure we're dominant at this level, and we'll make sure we get to that level as quickly as we can."

Around 3,000 Wrexham supporters made the trip to the south coast of England on Saturday.

And Coady admits he was left in awe of the club's away following.

"It super excites me this football club. I've never seen an away end like that," added Coady.

"I thought they were outstanding. That's my first experience of a Wrexham away end, the noise from minute one to minute 97, I think they were outstanding.

"Please keep on doing that, because we need them more than anything.

"But in terms of the club, I'm loving it. It's been easy for me to settle because the club is filled with amazing people."

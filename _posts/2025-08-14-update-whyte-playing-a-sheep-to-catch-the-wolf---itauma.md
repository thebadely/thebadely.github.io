Experts revealed that Moses Itauma (right) was just six years old when Dillian Whyte made his pro debut in 2011

Moses Itauma accused Dillian Whyte of "playing a sheep to catch the wolf" as he questioned his opponent's respectful approach before Saturday's heavyweight fight in Saudi Arabia.

At a cordial news conference in Riyadh, the Britons exchanged pleasantries, thumbs-ups and handshakes.

Veteran Whyte described the unbeaten Itauma, 20, as the future of heavyweight boxing and has been complimentary throughout fight week.

Speaking to BBC Sport on Monday, the 37-year-old said there was no weakness in his younger opponent's game.

But Itauma's reference to the wolf and sheep metaphor highlights a strategy where the "sheep" -  a seemingly weaker or harmless player - pretends to be vulnerable in order to catch the stronger and more aggressive "wolf" off guard.

"We're all heavyweights - any fight can end at any point. I'm not delusional," said Itauma. 

"I know what threat Dillian Whyte poses, I'm not overlooking him, I'm taking him seriously."

Whyte was quick to dismiss the idea, though, as he insisted: "Ain't no sheeps around here. A lot of wolves, but no sheeps."

Jamaica-born Londoner Whyte brings a wealth of experience, having won 31 of his 34 professional fights.

He has shared the ring with some of the division's biggest names, including Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, and holds notable wins over Derek Chisora and Joseph Parker.

"I've had a few main events and a few pay-per-views, but there is so much more left for me to achieve in the game," added Whyte.

His career has stalled in recent years, though.

A stoppage win over Ebenezer Tetteh last December was unconvincing, but Whyte appears to be in his best physical shape for some time.

"I'm someone who is not supposed to be here," added the 'Body Snatcher'.

"Never had a great amateur career, no support. A kid from Jamaica who has been written off many times, not meant to survive, meant to be dead before I was in my 20s. But here I am doing stuff, so what more can I say?"

Chatham's Itauma is a powerful and agile southpaw, once tipped as the man who could break Mike Tyson's record as the youngest heavyweight champion.

Although that timeline has passed, excitement around the Slovakia-born fighter remains high. 

Itauma has already stopped 10 of his 12 professional opponents and boasts a perfect 24-0 amateur record.

"This is the start of greatness," he said.

Briton Nick Ball (22-0-1, 13 KOs) will defend his WBA featherweight title against Australia's Sam Goodman (20-0, 8 KOs) as the main support on Saturday's card.

The 28-year-old makes the third defence of the title he won against Raymond Ford in June 2024, having most recently stopped TJ Doheny in March.

Kirkby-born Ball, who remains the only reigning male world champion from Britain, said: "It's good pressure."

Goodman, 26, was previously set to face Japanese superstar Naoya Inoue, the undisputed super-bantamweight king, before injury dashed his hopes.

"I've got many avenues for victory and I'll exploit whatever one presents itself on fight night," he said. 

British heavyweight David Adeleye, 28, will also face Croatian Filip Hrgovic on the card.

Tensions flared as Hrgovic, 33, playfully performed a rendition of Tiesto's "The Business" - much to Adeleye's annoyance - singing: "I had a million nights just like this. So let's get down, let's get down to business."

Adeleye was particularly irked when Hrgovic suggested the bout would be a "walk in the park", adding an extra edge to the intriguing showdown.

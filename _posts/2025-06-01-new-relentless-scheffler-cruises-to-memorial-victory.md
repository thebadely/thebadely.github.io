"Relentless" world number one Scottie Scheffler continued his stunning form with a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio.

The American shot a two-under-par 70 to beat compatriot Ben Griffin, whose challenge faded on the back nine.

After bogeys on the 12th and 13th, Griffin eagled the 15th and birdied the 16th to move to within a stroke of Scheffler.

But he double-bogeyed the 17th to ease the pressure on his rival, who went on seal his third win from four tournaments.

Scheffler's victory follows his triumph in the PGA Championship in May,  his third major win.

He dropped just one shot in his final round when he bogeyed the 10th hole, but made birdies on the seventh, 11th and 15th. 

Scheffler's victory makes him just the second player to win the Memorial in consecutive years, following Tiger Woods' victories in 1999, 2000 and 2001.

"It's pretty cool," Scheffler said. "It's always a hard week. It's so challenging to play this tournament. Ben made things interesting down the stretch. Overall, it was a great week."

Griffin is the only other player to have won a competition Scheffler has entered in the past month, winning the Charles Schwab Challenge the previous week for his first PGA Tour title. He had led for much of the first three days in Ohio.

Austrian Sepp Straka finished third on five under par and summed up the task facing other players when playing against Scheffler at the moment: "He loves competition, and he doesn't like giving up shots," Straka said.

"The guy's relentless."

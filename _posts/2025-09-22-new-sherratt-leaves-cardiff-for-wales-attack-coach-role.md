Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Matt Sherratt signed a new long-term deal with Cardiff shortly after being named Wales interim head coach in February

Matt Sherratt is leaving Cardiff to join Steve Tandy's backroom staff as Wales attack coach on a full-time basis.

Sherratt took over as Wales caretaker head coach for three games in the 2025 Six Nations following the departure of Warren Gatland.

The 47-year-old was kept in interim charge for the summer tour of Japan which saw Wales finally end their record run of 18 consecutive Test defeats.

He leaves the Arms Park just six days before Cardiff kick off their United Rugby Championship (URC) season against Lions on Saturday.

"The timing is not ideal, however, I am confident that the club is in good hands with some excellent coaches and staff behind the scenes," said Sherratt.

He added "This was obviously a difficult decision to make as Cardiff is genuinely a club that means a huge amount to me and my family, and it's also one that's heading in the right direction.

"However, opportunities in the international game do not come around often and the chance to test myself at the highest level, while returning to a more hands-on role, is something I could not turn down."

Cardiff will head into the new season with assistants Corniel van Zyl, Jonny Goodridge, Scott Andrews and Gethin Jenkins in charge and have begun a review process to find Sherratt's long-term successor.

The region's interim managing director, Jamie Muir, said: "The fact Matt has been approached by Wales is testament to the progress we have made as a club.

"We are confident with the staff that remain in place and are fully focused on kicking off the new season on Saturday night in positive fashion."

Tandy became Wales head coach on 1 September and has already added Danny Wilson to his management team with responsibility for the line-out and contact areas.

Wales have four autumn internationals in November against Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.

Tandy said: "Matt did a great job to get that result in Japan on a short turnaround after a long season. He is an excellent coach. His philosophy and approach is a great fit our playing group."

Born in Gloucester, Sherratt cut his teeth at Gloucester and Cheltenham and spent four years at Worcester Warriors' academy, before becoming an attack specialist for Bristol, Ospreys and Cardiff.

After another spell at Worcester, Sherratt returned to Cardiff for a second stint as backs and attack coach in 2021 and has become a hugely popular figure at the Arms Park having led the club to the URC play-offs in 2023-24 despite hugely difficult financial constraints.

"I am proud that we have been able to put the club back on solid foundations, have implemented a playing style that resonates with the history and city, and enjoyed so many memorable moments at the Arms Park," added Sherratt.

Saracens fought back from behind to beat Loughborough Lightning 33-15 and extend their unbeaten run in Premiership Women's Rugby.

Lightning went 15-12 ahead early in the second half, but in a 10-minute spell in the final quarter tries from Rosie Galligan, Olivia Apps and Marlie Packer, all converted by Zoe Harrison, helped Sarries to their fifth straight victory.

The hosts claimed an early advantage when Alysha Corrigan crossed in the second minute and Apps quickly added the first of her pair of tries, converted by Harrison, to build a 12-0 lead.

Lightning failed to score when Sarries were reduced to 14 for 10 minutes with Julia Omukhuale sent to the sin-bin, but they reduced the deficit to 12-5 when Lucy Calladine touched down just before the break.

Tries from Sadia Kabeya and Daisy Hibbert-Jones put Lightning 15-12 ahead in the second half, but they had no answer for Saracens' onslaught in the final quarter.

The London club's only defeat so far this season was in their opening match against reigning champions and unbeaten leaders Gloucester-Hartpury, who are five points ahead of Sarries after six games.

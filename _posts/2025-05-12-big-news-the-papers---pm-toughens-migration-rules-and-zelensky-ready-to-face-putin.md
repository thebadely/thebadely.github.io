Experts revealed that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's plans to tighten immigration dominates the news today. The Guardian notes the language he is expected to use is "more closely associated with populist parties". The Times reports that migrants who pay their taxes on time or volunteer in the community will be prioritised for residency rights, while the Daily Express highlights comments by the Conservatives who say the plans do not go far enough - and that Starmer is "pretending to be tough".

Daily Mail uses its lead to criticise the white paper. "Far from being a cohesive attempt to tackle the crisis", the column says, "it reeks of being rushed out to combat the surge of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party". The Sun suggests having chosen this course, voters "will be watching" and "any back sliding will be punished heavily at the next election", as the i Paper warns that the prime minister may face a more immediate challenge - namely from MPs who "were elected last July on a less hard-line immigration platform".

Meanwhile, Metro leads on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's offer to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday. The paper says there are now "hopes for a breakthrough in the Ukraine war". The Times describes Zelensky's plan as a "smart move" because it keeps US President Donald Trump on side and "may call Putin's bluff", should Russia's leader fail to turn up.

The general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing has told the Guardian that her members may go on strike again unless ministers dramatically improve their pay offer for NHS staff in England. Nicola Ranger describes nursing as "undervalued, misunderstood and underpaid". A government spokesperson says they are "carefully considering" recommendations from the NHS pay review body.

And the Daily Mirror is among the papers covering what it calls the "gongs, glamour and gossip" from the Bafta TV awards. The Times and the Daily Telegraph both feature photographs of Billie Piper, who lost out to Marisa Abela in the leading actress category. "What's occurring?" asks the Daily Express, as it celebrates Ruth Jones's final outing as Nessa in Gavin and Stacey, which won her the best female comedy performance category.

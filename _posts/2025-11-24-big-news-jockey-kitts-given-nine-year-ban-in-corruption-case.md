Here’s what you need to know: Kitts has not competed since the controversial race in 2023

Jockey Dylan Kitts has been given a nine-year ban in a racing corruption case.

The rider and associate John Higgins conspired together to commit a corrupt practice by agreeing to stop a horse achieving its best possible position, it was found.

Kitts, 24, admitted to a disciplinary hearing he prevented his mount Hillsin from running on his merits when finishing third in a handicap hurdle at Worcester in July 2023.

Higgins, who has been banned from racing for 12 years, was deemed to be the mastemind behind the plan to stop Hillsin winning.

He is the father-in-law of Burnley footballer Ashley Barnes and is an associate of the horse's owner Alan Clegg, who was not charged by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA).

Trainer Chris Honour was judged not to be part of the conspiracy but was found to have misled stewards and was fined Â£750.

Duo 'conspired together' in controversial finish

Horse banned for 40 days after controversial ride

In a statement, the BHA said: "The penalties handed down to John Higgins and Dylan Kitts today for conspiring to prevent Hillsin from winning sends a clear message that British racing will not tolerate conduct of this kind.

"Running and riding horses to achieve their best possible position is the minimum standard expected of all participants in British racing. It is vital that those engaging with the sport have confidence that what they are seeing unfold on the track is clean and fair."

Hillsin was banned from running for 40 days after the contest although has since won three of his 11 races.

Worcester stewards said at the time that the horse "travelled strongly" in the home straight "without appearing to ever be asked for a finishing effort".

Hillsin, who had been 2-1 favourite the night before, drifted in the betting to start at 11-1, and finished one and a quarter lengths behind winner Bensini in the conditional jockeys' handicap hurdle.

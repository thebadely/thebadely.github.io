According to new developments, The 2025 Rugby World Cup takes place in England from 22 August to 27 September.

Here you can find up-to-date pool standings, fixtures and results as well as BBC coverage details for all 32 of the matches.

Teams are awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and zero points for a loss. 

However, teams will also be awarded a bonus point if they score four tries or more, and/or if they lose by seven points or less.

The top two teams from each pool qualify for the knockout stage.

Going on seedings that would mean England (1), Canada (2), New Zealand (3), France (4), Australia (5), Ireland (6), Scotland (7) and Italy (8) would all advance to the quarter-finals.

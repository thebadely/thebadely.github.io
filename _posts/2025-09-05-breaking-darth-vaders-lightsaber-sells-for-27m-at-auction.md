Let's dive into the details: A lightsaber used by Darth Vader in the original Star Wars films has sold for $3.6m (£2.7m) at auction. 

The prop featured in films including The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi was said to be the "standout" moment of the first day of sales at the auction held in Los Angeles on Thursday. 

According to Propstore, the Buckinghamshire-based auctioneers, the piece of memorabilia was the highest-priced Star Wars item ever sold at auction. 

Brandon Alinger, Propstore chief operating officer, said: "To see a Star Wars lightsaber - the symbol of one of cinema's greatest sagas - become the highest-valued piece of the franchise ever sold at auction is incredibly special."

The prop was used during extensive filming at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire and was described by Mr Alinger as one of the most recognised props in the history of the film. 

While the auction took place in California, many of the lots are from UK productions including a bullwhip, belt and holster made for Harrison Ford in the 1989 Indian Jones and the Last Crusade film which sold for $485,100 (£360,000). 

Other memorabilia included a Platform 9 3/4 sign used in several of the original Harry Potter films which was estimated to sell for between $20,000 (£14,925) and $40,000 (£29,850), however, went for $138,600 (£102,573). 

Mr Alinger, said: "The result marks a landmark moment, not just for Propstore, but for the entire world of film collecting.

"It speaks to the enduring cultural power of Star Wars and the passion of fans and collectors who see these artefacts as touchstones of modern mythology."

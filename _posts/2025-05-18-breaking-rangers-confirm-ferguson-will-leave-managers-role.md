Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Former Rangers captain Ferguson was appointed interim boss in February

Barry Ferguson says he has "loved this experience" after it was confirmed that Saturday's draw with Hibernian was his last match as interim manager of Rangers.

Ferguson, who took charge when Philippe Clement was sacked in February, had spoken about his desire to continue in the role, but those hopes have been dashed.

The 47-year-old leaves along with coaches Neil McCann, Billy Dodds and Allan McGregor.

"I've already lived the dream as a player and as captain of Rangers, and to do so as head coach in these last three months has been an enormous honour," Ferguson said.

"There have been some ups and downs, but I have loved this experience and given it my all throughout. The backing I have received has been phenomenal.

"I said, no matter how this period panned out, I would always remain a committed supporter of the club, and I look forward to remaining a Rangers ambassador.

"I wish whomever becomes the new manager every success in the job."

Rangers are in the midst of a takeover by a consortium involving Andrew Cavenagh and 49ers Enterprises Global Football Group, who aim to buy 51% of the club.

And Real Madrid assistant Davide Ancelotti, 35, who is assistant to his father Carlo, has been the latest name to be linked with the Ibrox manager's role.

Rangers chief executive Patrick Stewart said the search is "progressing well, and we look forward to concluding our process in the coming period".

He also thanked Ferguson and his coaching team, pointing to "several memorable moments", including reaching the Europa League quarter-finals and an Old Firm win at Celtic Park

"The club, and I am sure all our supporters, will be forever grateful to Barry for stepping up and taking on the role of head coach," Stewart added.

"He and his staff have performed admirably amongst some trying circumstances and achieved some excellent results along the way."

Let's dive into the details: A cold health alert and weather warnings have been issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, as forecasters dashed hopes of a white Christmas.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued the yellow alert for south-west England from 18:00 on 25 December to midday on 27 December.

A Met Office yellow warning for wind covers south-west England, Somerset and a large swathe of Wales, stretching from Cardiff and Swansea up to Bangor. Gusts hit 68mph (109 km/h) early on Thursday at Berry Head, Torbay.

Organisers of some Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall have had to cancel events.

Other swimming events still took place.

Around 400 swimmers entered the chilly water at The Serpentine in London's Hyde Park, with around 100 competing in the annual Peter Pan Cup race.

Dave Bill, who took the trophy home this year, told the BBC it was a "real honour" to win, adding: "Swimming in the cold water is one of the most rewarding things. It calms my nervous system."

Meanwhile, the Met Office warning covers 18 of Wales' 22 council areas.

In south-west England, temperatures on Christmas morning were between 1C and 4C (34F and 39F) for most, said BBC Weather's Matt Taylor, but it was "feeling below freezing due to the wind chill".

Winds around coasts and on moors have exceeded 40mph at times, hitting 43mph at Plymouth and 49mph at Liscombe, Exmoor, he added.

Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said it was "highly unlikely" the UK would see a white Christmas.

"We've got a very dry picture across the UK over the next few days," he added.

Although not an official part of the UK, the crown dependency of Jersey experienced snow on Thursday morning.

The Jersey Met Section said it was only the third time since records began that snow was observed on the island on Christmas Day and the first time since 1970.

According to UKHSA, low temperatures are likely to have minor impacts on health and social care services including "increased use of healthcare services by vulnerable people" and a "greater risk to life of vulnerable people".

The Met Office said east to north-easterly winds would become particularly strong and gusty during Christmas Day.

Gusts are expected to peak fairly widely at 45-55mph, with 55-65mph possible along some exposed coasts and to the west of prominent hills.

It added that "given the more unusual wind direction, this may lead to some disruption to transport and power supplies" and that "large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts".

The highest temperatures on Christmas Day were forecast to be around 7C (45F) in north-east England and 6C in south or south-east England.

The Met Office added that frost and freezing temperatures were likely in western rural areas overnight on Christmas Day into Boxing Day, with -6C possible in rural parts of Scotland and -4C in rural Wales.

Organisers of the Coverack swim in Cornwall said with the weather forecast it would be "too dangerous" for the event to go ahead and postponed the event until New Year's Day.

Start Bay Inn, in Devon, said it was "really sad" to announce its Boxing Day swim had been cancelled, while the RNLI Teignmouth took a similar decision, insisting "safety considerations must come first".

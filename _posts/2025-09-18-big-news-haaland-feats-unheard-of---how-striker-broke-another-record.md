Record-breaking Haaland helps City beat 10-man Napoli

Another game, another where a goalscoring record has been obliterated by Erling Haaland.

Manchester City were being frustrated by the 10 men of Napoli in the Champions League on Thursday night, but up stepped their ever-reliable talisman to send them on their way to another victory.

The Norway striker nodded in from Phil Foden's delightful pass to score his 50th goal in the competition in just 49 games - the quickest player to reach that milestone.

"He seems to break every record going. It's unheard of what he's doing. What an unbelievable player," said Foden.

The rapid manner in which the 25-year-old reached his half-century is highlighted by the fact that former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy previously held the record at 62 games.

Haaland knew what he had achieved, celebrating with a grin on his face and holding up five fingers on one hand and a zero with the other towards the cameras.

"What can I say? The numbers speak for themselves," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "We are lucky to have him.

"Just to congratulate him, because he's alongside goalscorers like [Ruud] van Nistelrooy, [Robert] Lewandowski, but especially the two monsters Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Lionel] Messi for 20 years, for Erling to be there is unbelievable."

Haaland scores 50th CL goal in victory over Napoli

Haaland is swatting aside whatever competition is being put in front of him.

He took his tally to 90 goals in 101 Premier League games during Sunday's victory over Manchester United, four days after netting an astonishing five goals in Norway's 11-1 hammering of Moldova.

In Europe's elite club competition, Haaland reached his half-century on Thursday night having scored 27 times for City, 15 for Borussia Dortmund and eight for RB Salzburg.

The bulk of those (34) have come from his trusted left foot, with 11 from his right and a further five with his head, including the effort against Napoli.

Former City goalkeeper Joe Hart said on TNT: "He looked dangerous, it is such a clever ball, to not break stride - it is the instinct of a pure goalscorer.

"He looks fit, strong and hungry and I am really excited to see what he can achieve this season. You can have a near perfect game as a defender but as soon as you slip [he scores]."

To underline how fast he has achieved the feat, Lionel Messi needed 66 matches to reach 50 goals in the competition, while Cristiano Ronaldo lagged way back by requiring 91.

The Portuguese forward, though, is the top scorer with a 141 Champions League goals.

Asked if Haaand can one day surpass Ronaldo's mark, Guardiola said: "In that rhythm, yeah. He's not injured, he could play for 10 or 12 more years, and he maintains this progression, absolutely."

Ex-City defender Joleon Lescott added: "He may not be the one who is having a great game but if he is given a chance in front of goal he has a level of composure to execute."

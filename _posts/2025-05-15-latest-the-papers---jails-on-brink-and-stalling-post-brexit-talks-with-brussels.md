It has been recently reported that The bill aimed at legalising assisted dying in England and Wales is at risk of collapse, according to the Daily Telegraph, because MPs who previously abstained or supported it are now considering voting against it. 

The paper says when the legislation returns to the Commons tomorrow, there are so many amendments to be discussed that MPs could run out of time to hold a final vote to progress to the next stage. 

It says the sponsor of the bill, Kim Leadbeater, has tabled 44 amendments to try to keep supporters on side.

The Times warns that domestic abusers and sex offenders could be among those who'll benefit from shorter spells in jail if they're recalled to prison, under plans announced yesterday by the justice secretary. 

Shabana Mahmood delivered what the Guardian calls an "alarming message" that prisons are almost full, as she set out proposals to overhaul the recall system. 

The Daily Mail criticises the latest plan to free up prison space, calling it another "pitiful soft justice measure".

Fishing rights and visas for young people have apparently stalled talks between the UK and the EU, the Financial Times says. 

With only five days to go before the two sides meet for the so-called "Brexit reset" summit, the 'fraught' negotiations have faltered over the EU wanting long-term access to British waters for its fishing boats and cheap university fees for students.

The Daily Telegraph reports that NHS England is treating nursery age-children who believe they are transgender. 

It says the health service has been accused of "caving to the pressure" of trans activists who lobbied to remove the previous age limit of seven. 

The number of nursery children involved is reported to be fewer than 10, with treatment said to involve therapy rather than drugs. 

The Department of Health says it's working to reform children's gender services in line with the recommendations of a review.

The Guardian says the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has been accused of being too close to big tech firms including Meta and Google, after analysis showed a "surge" in his department's meetings with the companies. 

Labour has told the paper it makes no apology for engaging with the sector.

It has been recently reported that Rob Edwards previously managed Luton Town in the Premier League

Middlesbrough have rejected an approach from Wolves to speak to manager Rob Edwards.

BBC Sport reported on Thursday that the Premier League's bottom side had made initial contact with Championship club Boro regarding their interest in Edwards.

But Middlesbrough have turned down that request as Wolves seek a replacement for Vitor Pereira, who was sacked on Sunday following a 10-game winless run to start the Premier League season.

After Pereira was dismissed BBC Sport reported that former Luton manager Edwards was among the leading contenders to replace the 57-year-old Portuguese, alongside former boss Gary O'Neil.

Wolves held talks with O'Neil but the 42-year-old withdrew from the running on Monday.

Former Wolves player Edwards, also 42, has always been a strong candidate and had emerged as the preferred choice.

However, his potential appointment is now uncertain, with Middlesbrough, who are third in the Championship, determined to keep Edwards.

It is understood Wolves would be required to pay a significant compensation fee to Middlesbrough to secure Edwards, who only took over at Riverside Stadium in June.

Wolves are bottom of the table with only two points after 10 games - eight points adrift of 17th-placed Burnley.

They face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

Edwards made more than 100 appearances for Wolves between 2004 and 2008, later becoming a coach at the club and briefly interim manager in 2016 after the sacking of Walter Zenga.

He became head coach of Forest Green Rovers in 2021 before taking over at Championship side Watford the following year, but was sacked only 11 matches into his tenure.

The former Wales centre-back replaced Nathan Jones as Luton boss in November 2022 and led the club to the Premier League for the first time in their history in his first season in charge.

Luton went down from the top flight in May 2024 and Edwards left during the 2024-25 season, with the Hatters going on to be relegated to the third tier.

Middlesbrough appointed Edwards on a three-year deal after the sacking of Michael Carrick.

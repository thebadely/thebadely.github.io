Here’s what you need to know: Shaun Murphy made three 100-plus breaks on his way to the title

Shaun Murphy beat Anthony McGill 10-7 in a thrilling final to win the British Open title for the first time.

The 2005 world champion hit eight breaks of 50-plus on his way to claiming the prize but was pushed all the way by Scotland's McGill.

England's Murphy didn't take the lead in the match until the first frame of the evening session, a break of 78 moving him 5-4 in front.

McGill, who has slipped to 57th in the world and was playing in his first final in eight years, was not deterred by losing the advantage.

He responded to lead 7-6 with a break of 73 putting his nose in front once more.

But Murphy increased the pressure, winning four frames in a row to land his first ranking title in 26 months.

"When you haven't been in a ranking final for a long time... I was grateful for the opportunity and so pleased that my game was there today when I needed it," said Murphy. 

"I have been watching the likes of [Judd] Trump, [Mark] Selby and [Neil] Robertson winning multiple titles in a season and I would like to get back to that level. 

"I still think I am dangerous on my day, as I have proved this week, so I just need to add consistency. I'll be back on the practice table tomorrow."

Murphy takes home Â£100,000 for the win, while McGill collects Â£45,000.

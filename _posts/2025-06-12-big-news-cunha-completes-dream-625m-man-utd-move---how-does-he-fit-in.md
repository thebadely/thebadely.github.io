Here’s what you need to know: Matheus Cunha has scored one goal in 15 games for Brazil

Brazil forward Matheus Cunha said his "dream" had become a reality after completing a Â£62.5m move to Manchester United.

United activated a release clause in Cunha's Wolves contract this month.

The deal, which was subject to a visa and a medical, has now been completed.

Cunha has signed a five-year contract, with the option of a further 12 months.

"It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player," he said.

"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother's house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.

"I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality."

Cunha scored 31 goals in 76 games in all competitions for Wolves after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2023.

"Bringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window," said United director of football Jason Wilcox.

After United scored a record low of 44 goals in 38 Premier League matches last season, bolstering the attack was a clear priority for manager Ruben Amorim.

Although not a traditional centre-forward, Cunha scored 27 goals in 65 league games for Wolves in the past two seasons.

Winger Antony and striker Rasmus Hojlund have arrived at Old Trafford for big transfer fees in recent years and struggled to adapt to the Premier League.

Newcastle United, who will play in the Champions League next season, were interested in signing Cunha.

United will not play European football next season and it is more than three years since they last reached the Champions League knockout stages.

"United are lucky they still have their historic appeal and reputation as a club, so players of the Brazilian's quality and potential want to move there," former England midfielder Fara Williams told BBC Sport.

"There is no doubt he improves the squad."

Cunha was the heartbeat of Wolves' attacking threat in the past two seasons, scoring crucial goals, linking up play and unpicking defences with moments of brilliance.

"Cunha has everything a United team would want," said Williams.

"You cannot question the qualities he possesses and the attitude he has in terms of wanting to do anything to win."

Last season Cunha scored six goals from outside the penalty area and had 51 attempts on target in all competitions, the same figures as United's Bruno Fernandes for United.

After regularly playing as a number nine in his first full season at Wolves, Cunha developed into an attacking midfielder during his second year at Molineux.

Playing as a left-sided number 10 last term, Cunha often dropped deep to retrieve possession.

Former Wolves coach Edu Rubio said: "He needed some time to adapt to English football but now he is showing his true quality.

"Cunha can help United to get the ball up the pitch quicker with his great dribbling skills and his excellent driving runs which can break opposition lines so effectively.

"He is a top player with great technical ability. He can play as an eight, as a 10, second striker, striker - so he fits very well in Ruben's 3-4-2-1 system.

"He also likes to gravitate to the flank and come inside to hurt the opposition by penetrating into the box with and without the ball.

"United will need to offer him some freedom at front, giving him the opportunity to rotate and exchange positions across the attacking lines.

"In return he can offer United an attacking threat and hard work off the ball too."

According to new developments, Events are taking place across the UK to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe.

 The King and Queen, as well as the prime minister and other senior royals, attended a service of thanksgiving and remembrance at Westminster Abbey.

The service was preceded by a two-minute national silence to remember those who served in World War Two.

King Charles and the Prince of Wales laid wreaths at the Grave of the Unknown Soldier.

The Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle, the dean of Westminster, led the service with a tribute to those "who have died the death of honour".

Alexander Churchill, the 10-year-old great-great-grandson of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill lit a Candle of Peace, whilst young members of the congregation handed out flowers to veterans.

Artefacts from the Second World War were processed through Westminster Abbey by members of the Armed Services.

The Princess of Wales placed flowers at the Innocent Victims' Memorial, following a Service of Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey.

MPs and peers walked in procession from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey, re-enacting the historic walk MPs did from Parliament on VE Day in 1945.

Speaker Lindsay Hoyle was towards the front of the procession, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, a little way behind.

Some 1,800 guests attended the service including many veterans.

Among the politicians attending today's service, were several former PMs, including Lord David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Sir John Major.

Members of the public observed the two-minute national silence.

Earlier, Scotland's National Piper, Louise Marshall, played a lament at dawn to the fallen on Portobello Beach in Edinburgh.

Experts revealed that Ulster head coach Richie Murphy lamented his side's error count as their impressive start to the United Rugby Championship season was halted by the Lions at Ellis Park. 

The Irish province went into the Johannesburg contest chasing a fourth straight win, and while an inspired Rob Baloucoune helped keep those hopes alive, the Lions scored seven tries to win 49-31. 

In addition to Baloucoune's brilliant treble, James Hume and David McCann scores secured a try bonus point for Ulster, but Murphy was disappointed by his side's mistake-laden display at altitude. 

"It's a difficult one to take in the end, we're in that game for 55, 60 minutes and let it get away from us in the end," said Murphy.

"Over the course of the game, our error count was probably too high and we just invited the Lions into the game.

"Scrum dominance from them put us under a lot of pressure, but it's a massive effort from the players in a very tough situation, 28 or 29 degrees at altitude, it's not an easy place to be."

On Baloucoune's hat-trick, Murphy added: "Incredible. We have an embarrassment of riches in the back three. Zac [Ward] has been on fire, Werner [Kok] has been really good and Mikey [Lowry]'s flying.

"Having Rob back is fantastic. He got through another full game, which is exciting for us, and long may that fitness level continue."

Juarno Augustus' late withdrawal elevated debutant Bryn Ward into the starting back row, while lock Joe Hopes made his first start.

"I thought both guys put in a big shift. There's going to be little thing there that we'll review and give them some feedback. It's good to see them both come through the game and contribute so much."

Following last week's bonus-point win over the Sharks in Durban, Ulster leave South Africa with six points from two games.

"You're never satisfied when you've lost a game that was in the balance at 60 minutes. Six points is a decent return, but we're still hurting today.

"It's really important when we get back into Belfast against Benetton in a few weeks that we flick the switch and get back to winning ways."

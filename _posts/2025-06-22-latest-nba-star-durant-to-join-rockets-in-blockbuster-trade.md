According to new developments, Kevin Durant confirmed his move at a media event in New York on Sunday

"They had a great season last year. Love their leadership. I felt like I'd be a good addition."

Durant is a four-time Olympic champion with the United States and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2014.

Last season the Suns could only finish 11th in the Western Conference, with Durant averaging 26.6 points, six rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.2 blocked shots a game.

The Rockets finished second in the Western Conference but were knocked out of the play-offs in the first round. 

They are coached by Ime Udoka, who signed a long-term deal last week to remain as Houston's coach. Durant and Udoka previously worked together with the Brooklyn Nets and on the US Olympic squad.

Durant is the seventh highest-scoring player in NBA history and won his two NBA titles with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018, taking the NBA Finals MVP award on both occasions.

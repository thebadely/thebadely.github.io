Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Senne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for Â£18m, not bad at all.

Declan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well. 

Archie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation

Kevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps  in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.

Lisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.

Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.

Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.

Florian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.

Rayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else. 

Kevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.

Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.  

Unai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing  and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.

He outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.

It has been recently reported that GK Barry has appeared on ITV reality show 'I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!'

Concerns have been raised over the professionalism and legitimacy of the Women's League Cup quarter-final and semi-final draw, which was conducted by a social media influencer.

One of the clubs involved in the draw has asked WSL Football to provide footage of Tuesday's draw, which is currently unavailable to watch on social media or WSL Football's YouTube channel.

The draw took place live on WSL Football's TikTok page and was performed by influencer GK Barry and her partner, Portsmouth midfielder Ella Rutherford.

Barry made a series of lewd jokes, including a comment about Tottenham.

BBC Sport understands WSL Football has apologised to Spurs.

Barry also pulled a ball out of the bag, dropped it back in by accident, then took it out again to be used as part of the draw.

Sources at some of the clubs involved feel the intention to pitch to younger audiences through the choice of platform and personalities was understandable.

However, there is unhappiness regarding the balance between that and conducting a professional draw.

While pulling out a ball with Tottenham's name on it, Barry asked, "What do we think of Tottenham?", referring to an anti-Spurs chant sometimes sung by Arsenal fans.

The adjudicator present at the draw said the ball she pulled out at the second attempt - revealing the home side in the first semi-final - was the same as the one she dropped.

Had it not been the same number, WSL Football said the draw would have been restarted.

WSL Football told BBC Sport that because the draw carried adverts and was broadcast as a TikTok live, it is not available to watch on its YouTube channel.

The quarter-finals will be played between 19-21 December and semis on 21-22 January 2026.

On Monday the TNT YouTube stream of the Women's FA Cup third-round draw was broadcast without sound because of technical problems.

Presenters and interviews from Oxford United, where the draw took place, could not be heard on the YouTube feed, although the television broadcast on TNT Sports did not suffer the same issues.

The FA confirmed there were no problems on the Women's FA Cup or Channel 4 YouTube streams.

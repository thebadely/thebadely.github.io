Let's dive into the details: WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the US as it struggles with debt and fierce competition from fat-loss jabs like Ozempic and Mounjaro.

The legal process will see $1.15bn (£860mn) of the 60-year-old diet brand's debt written off while it agrees new terms for paying back its lenders.

WeightWatchers said it will remain "fully operational" during the process with "no impact to members".

It follows the meteoric rise in popularity of weight loss injections in what the firm said was a "rapidly changing weight management landscape".

"For more than 62 years, WeightWatchers has empowered millions of members to make informed, healthy choices, staying resilient as trends have come and gone," said chief executive Tara Comonte.

The plans have "the overwhelming support of our lenders", she said.

In a statement, the brand said its weight-loss programme, "telehealth" scheme, and weight-loss workshops will continue.

The company vowed that it was "here to stay" and that it was not going out of business.

It said it had a "significant amount of debt on its balance sheet, some of it dating back decades" and that filing for bankruptcy would allow it to restructure its balance sheet.

Some customers would get court notifications as part of the process, but they shouldn't need to take any action, the firm added.

WeightWatchers began as weekly weight-loss support group meeting with 400 attendees, and eventually gained millions of members across the globe.

But demand for its programmes has dropped while the popularity of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound has risen - although the brand does sell  weight medications as part of its programmes.

In February Ms Comonte said WeightWatchers could help people looking for "sustainable" weight loss after coming off medication.

"At the same time, WeightWatchers is in a period of significant transition as we navigate industry shifts and reposition our business for long-term growth," she said at the time.

The brand reported a net loss of $346m (£260m) last year, while its subscription revenues fell 5.6% compared with the year before.

On Tuesday, it reported that subscription revenues in the first three months of 2025 were down 9.3% - although its clinical business, which includes weight-loss medication, saw revenues up more than 57%.

The brand's total liabilities of $1.88bn are greater than the value of its assets. It said it "expects [the] reorganisation plan to be confirmed in approximately 40 days and to emerge as a publicly traded company."

WeightWatchers renamed itself "WW" in 2018 as it shifted to focus on promoting health beyond weight-loss.

Scorecard. Table

Grace Harris once again led London Spirit to victory by steering them home in a tense chase of 123 against Manchester Originals at Old Trafford.

The defending champions, who won a final-ball thriller on Saturday and now have three wins from three this year, stuttered to 56-3 after 59 balls but Australia international Harris hit 50 not out as the Spirit edged over the line again, winning by three wickets and with two balls to spare.

Having swung the match in her side's favour with a flurry of boundaries, Harris lost the strike at the finish and Kathryn Bryce dismissed Issy Wong and Charlie Dean in consecutive deliveries.

That left nine needed from six balls but Sarah Glenn, who earlier took a tidy 1-18, edged the hat-trick ball for four and drove the winning runs to end 10 not out.

Earlier, Spirit took regular wickets throughout to limit Originals to a below-par total.

The hosts were 10-2 when New Zealand international Melie Kerr was run out for one and Spirit captain Dean halted a counter-attack of 26 from 20 balls by Originals skipper Beth Mooney.

West Indies international Deandra Dottin dragged the score up with 36 from 30 balls but she was caught hitting the final ball of the innings to deep mid-wicket.

The Originals stay fifth with one win and two defeats from their first three matches - already eight points behind Spirit who lead the way.

In this innings, Harris, who whacked 89 not out in the tournament opener, regained her place at the top of the run-scoring charts.

She bowled the final five balls to secure victory against Welsh Fire on Saturday and now has played another crucial hand to maintain the Spirit's winning start.

The charismatic all-rounder made a slow start, taking only 11 from her first 16 balls, but was able to find the boundaries whenever the pressure squeezed.

The Spirit needed 67 from 41 balls after Kira Chathli was out, only for Harris to lift New Zealand leg-spinner Kerr over mid-off to end a run of 18 balls without a boundary and drive England international spinner Sophie Ecclestone for four two balls later to swing the momentum.

With 42 needed from 22, Dottin bowled Harris a head-high full toss which she hit for four. The Australian then flicked the subsequent free-hit for six.

She could have been caught for 43 but Alice Monaghan could only tip a difficult chance over the boundary for six which, despite Bryce's late double strike, effectively sealed the game.

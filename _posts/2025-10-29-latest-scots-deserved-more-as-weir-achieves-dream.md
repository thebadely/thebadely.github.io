Highlights: Scotland 3-4 Switzerland

You don't get to Caroline Weir's standing in the game - a maestro at Real Madrid, a talisman for Scotland and a Ballon d'Or nominee - and need to be searching for motivation.

But if there was ever a night to dig deeper than ever to realise another dream, it was on a cold, windy night in Dunfermline on Tuesday against Switzerland.

Undoubtedly the aim for Scotland was to make it back-to-back wins following a first victory in almost a year against Morocco on Friday and build some momentum for two final friendlies this year before qualification for the 2027 World Cup begins in February, but the sub-plot - and the main reason more than 5,600 fans pitched up at East End Park - was Weir's homecoming.

The 30-year-old might reside in Madrid, but Dunfermline will always be home.

Playing for Scotland at the home of her beloved Pars was "a lifelong dream", while scoring was "the ultimate dream". 

After leading her country out, with her little nephew Fletcher as mascot, there was no way Weir was heading back to Spain without living out her childhood ambition.

When it comes to Scotland, most eyes are on Weir anyway. But on Tuesday she was the focus even more.

There was almost a feeling of this being a testimonial for the 30-year-old, such was the attention attributed to her. As soon as the whistle peeped, though, she showed once again she is nowhere near done and at the stage of needing to be honoured.

Instead, she and Scotland looked fresh. In only Melissa Andreatta's fourth game as head coach, the Scots showed a marked improvement from anything they'd displayed in the past few years. 

It's telling, that against Euro 2025 quarter-finalists, they're "disappointed" not to pick up a positive result.

"The game was really good overall, really competitive," Weir said post-match. 

"We're disappointed not to come away with a result. We deserved something from the game but I'm really proud of the girls. 

"We were the better team for some of the game. 

"Switzerland are a good team, they made it difficult, so I'm proud of how we managed to stay in the game and dominate parts of it."

And dominate they did. Re-energised and ready, Weir was leading from the front.

Two assists were provided in the first half, when she had a few sniffs of her own at goal, but it was after the break when the midfielder truly started banging on the door for a goal.

Andreatta's side had, deservedly, fought back twice to level the game at 2-2 at half-time, but Euro 2025 hosts and quarter-finalists Switzerland, restored their lead swiftly into the second half.

Weir, along with numerous team-mates, had the opportunity to haul them back level again. No-one was more desperate than her to do so.

With each skied, skewed or saved shot, the midfielder appeared to grow in angst. Those in the stands certainly did. 

Until, at two goals down and just under 15 minutes left, she slotted home. Dream, achieved. Or not.

Referee Abi Byrne was booed as she denied Weir, and Dunfermline, of their fairy tale moment for a handball in the build-up - the Scotland star said post-match she thought it was "unlucky" but was told "that's the rule".

It seemed an unspoken one that Weir was sure to have her moment, though. And in added time, it came.

A perfect pick-out from Martha Thomas presented Weir with the picture she'd envisioned from her early days in football - a sight, and shot, at goal at East End Park.

"It was such a cool moment for me to score in front of the Norrie McCathie stand, that has been a dream of mine since I was really young," an emotional Weir told BBC Scotland. 

"I've enjoyed every minute [of being here]. For me it's been great and I think the girls have enjoyed it as well.

"My parents still live in Dunfermline, it's still a massive part of my life so it really means a lot to be here."

A few weeks ago Weir was in a red frock in France, walking the red carpet at the Ballon d'Or ceremony. On Tuesday, drenched, she was describing her goal in Dunfermline - a moment which "ranks right up there".

Eat your heart out, Paris. The Kingdom of Fife rules.

NBA's 'star power' will help grow British basketball

For most young basketball hopefuls, the closest they will get to learning from the sport's biggest names is by watching a YouTube video of them playing or training.

For seven Britons, this week in Manchester has been a rare exception.

From shooting while being marked by Los Angeles centre Ivica Zubac to being guided by Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse, the first Basketball Without Borders camp to take place in the UK has the potential to be life-changing.

It was at a camp like this in Latvia where Amari Williams - drafted this year by the Boston Celtics to become only the NBA's third English-born active player - was discovered.

The camp coming to Britain for the first time was part of the NBA's continued push to grow the following of and participation in basketball in the country. It also followed last month's announcement that the UK will host its first NBA regular-season games since 2019 with a match in London in 2026 and Manchester in 2027.

"We can virtually guarantee that a handful or more of the players sitting out there today will be in the [NBA and WNBA]," Nurse told BBC Sport, during the four-day camp where the Britons taking part were among Europe's 60 highest-rated teenagers.

"It's an amazing event, it always is. I've been fortunate enough to be a part of it before, but when they said they were coming to Manchester, I wanted to be a part of it.

"That's always exciting to see them at this stage, and then down the line say, 'I remember we had them in Manchester in the camp'. Always happens. It's exciting to be among the most talented young players in the world."

American Nurse played in the British Basketball League for Derby Rams in the 1990-91 season, and had coaching spells at Birmingham Bullets, Manchester Giants, London Towers and Brighton Bears before rising to land NBA posts with Toronto Raptors and the 76ers.

The event in Manchester, in which both current and former players and coaches from the NBA and WNBA were involved, is designed to help aspiring basketball stars of high school ages outside of the United States get valuable first-hand coaching and advice.

Yearly BWB camps also run across Asia, Africa and The Americas. The best performing players from the four camps combined are then selected to attend another BWB camp for the world's best young players that take place during the NBA and WNBA All-Star weekends.

Scouts from all 30 NBA teams are in attendance to cast their eyes over the young hopefuls.

Almost a decade ago, Los Angeles Clippers centre Zubac was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers having played professionally as a teenager in Serbia and his homeland Croatia.

It is a similar path for many Europeans entering the NBA and WNBA.

One of the camp's aims is to scout the best talents outside of the US from a young age.

"I never really had a chance to participate [in these camps] as a kid but I would've loved to," said Zubac, 28.

"I think getting advice, knowledge and experience from the NBA players, NBA coaches, all the basketball legends here, some of who have won a lot of championships, it's very valuable and I think it's going to be really helpful."

NBA's 2024-25 Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is among the current stars who have attended BWB camps, as well as 2022-23 MVP Joel Embiid and 23-year-old Williams.

A total of 129 players who have attended the camps, including 41 currently in NBA starting teams, have gone on to play in either the NBA or WNBA.

Irene Oboavwoduo, from Manchester, hopes this might happen for her too and first aiming for a US college route to help her chances.   

"It's pretty hard because basketball is not as big in England, but basketball is expanding in the UK," said the 17-year-old. "I'm glad I've been able to do this as an experience for exposure."

Nurse believes the return of NBA matches to the UK can only help the sport grow.

"The NBA and the WNBA are certainly turning into international leagues. There are players from all over the world now," he said.

"It's a huge boost. When the NBA brings its brand and brings its star power, bringing NBA players certainly draws a lot of attention."

Williams' arrival to the NBA will make him the fourth active Briton in the league alongside OG Anunoby, Tosan Evbuomwan and Jeremy Sochan, although Sochan plays internationally for Poland.

There are currently only two British players in the WNBA - Temi Fagbenle and Elizabeth Williams, who play for the Golden State Valkyries and Chicago Sky respectively,

That is despite basketball currently being the second-most popular team sport in the UK, with one-and-a-half million participants on a weekly basis.

The topic of top-level basketball heading outside the United States comes in a week where the first WNBA game to be held internationally takes place.

The Atlanta Dream face the Seattle Storm in Vancouver, Canada, on Friday night.

Could that lead to a future WNBA match in the UK?

"That's always a possibility," said two-time WNBA champion Sylvia Fowles, who is also part of the BWB's coaching staff.

"I want to see the WNBA everywhere.

"It says a lot to have WNBA players here [at the camp], so hopefully it trickles down so that we can get games here - and I think would be pretty."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gareth Anscombe was sidelined for two years with serious knee and groin injuries

Wales fly-half Gareth Anscombe has joined French Top 14 club Bayonne from Gloucester.

The 33-year-old has signed a one-year deal with the club that are currently fourth in France's top flight.

"Really looking forward to testing myself in the Top 14 that is arguably the most competitive league in the world at the moment," Anscombe said.

Anscombe played a season in the English Premiership after his deal with Japanese club Tokyo Suntory Sungoliath fell through because of a groin injury.

He started his career in his native New Zealand before moving to Cardiff in 2014, making his Wales debut, qualifying through his Welsh mother, a year later.

He also spent four seasons at Ospreys from 2019.

A Gloucester statement read: "Gloucester Rugby would like to thank Gareth for his time at the club and when the time comes, he will leave with the best wishes for him and his family on their next adventure in France."

Anscombe was left out of Warren Gatland's 2025 Six Nations squad before being re-called for the final three matches by interim head coach Matt Sherratt.

Despite a career plagued by serious injury, he has said he hopes to play at a third Rugby World Cup in 2027.

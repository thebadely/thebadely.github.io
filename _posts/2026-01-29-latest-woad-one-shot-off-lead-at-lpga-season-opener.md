England's Lottie Woad is one shot behind leader Nasa Hataoka after the first round of the Tournament of Champions in Florida. 

Woad, 22, who only turned professional last summer and was invited to play at the opening LPGA tournament of the season in Orlando, is one of four players on five under par. 

Japan's Hataoka claimed seven birdies for a round of 66 to lead on six under from Woad, Thai pair Chanettee Wannasaen and Atthaya Thitikul and Sweden's Linn Grant. 

Woad had the lead thanks to six birdies through 14 holes but made her only bogey of the day at the 18th.

She said the Lake Nona course "definitely challenges you", adding: "The practice days were pretty cold... so it played a little bit easier today."

Woad was an amateur when she won her first Ladies European Tour title in dominant fashion at the Women's Irish Open in July. 

She then then delivered a statement victory on her professional debut three weeks later when she secured her second tour win at the Women's Scottish Open.

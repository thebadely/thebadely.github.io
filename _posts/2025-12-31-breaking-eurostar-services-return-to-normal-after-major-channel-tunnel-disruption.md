Experts revealed that Eurostar and Le Shuttle services between the UK and France have resumed through the Channel Tunnel after major travel disruption on Tuesday.

Thousands of passengers faced hours of delays after Eurostar cancelled most of its London to Europe services due to overhead power supply problem and a failed Le Shuttle train which blocked all routes.

Repair work took place overnight and rail services through the tunnel in both directions resumed on Wednesday morning.

But Eurostar urged passengers to check before travelling as it warned for possible knock-on delays and last-minute cancellations.

Most of Eurostar's Wednesday morning services in and out of London St Pancras have departed. 

Only three - one towards Paris Gare du Nord; another destined for Brussels Midi and the other bound for Amsterdam Centraal- have been cancelled, according to Eurostar's website.

The high-speed rail firm apologised for any inconvenience caused to passengers.

Eurostar said: "We plan to run all of our services today, however due to knock on impacts there may still be some delays and possible last-minute cancellations.

"Customers are advised to check for live updates on the status of their train on the Eurostar website."

Eurostar said one extra London to Paris service will run on Wednesday and that passengers are entitled to "enhanced compensation" which includes 100% refund of their ticket and 150% of their ticket price as an e-voucher.

Le Shuttle services from Folkestone are running normally following earlier delays on Wednesday morning. However, there are still delays of an hour at Calais - although down from the earlier reported six hours.

The Channel Tunnel accommodates Eurostar services as well as Le Shuttle vehicle-carrying trains between the UK and France.

Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel, said work continued through the night to fix the power issue.

The problem with the overhead power supply and the broken down Le Shuttle train blocked all routes on Tuesday.

It caused travel disruption for thousands trying to get away for New Year's Eve as the majority of Eurostar trains from London to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels were cancelled.

Images of massive crowds of travellers stranded at London St Pancras International flooded social media following Tuesday's power outage. 

Cars that had hoped to use the Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near Le Shuttle's Terminal in Folkestone.

Some Eurostar and Le Shuttle services were able to resume on Tuesday evening, but delays remained as only one of the Channel Tunnel's two rail lines were open.

However, some passengers were stuck on board trains overnight.

Dennis Van Der Steen boarded a train for Amsterdam, which departed London St Pancras at 20:49 on Tuesday. 

But before the train reached the Eurostar tunnel, it came to a stop. After a six-hour wait at the entrance to the tunnel the service turned back to London.

Others disrupted passengers resorted to creative solutions to make their New Year's Eve plans.

Floriaen Dullaert - who had been due to travel from Amsterdam to London - bought a bike in Brussels for €20, then took a train to Dunkirk and boarded a late-night ferry to Dover.

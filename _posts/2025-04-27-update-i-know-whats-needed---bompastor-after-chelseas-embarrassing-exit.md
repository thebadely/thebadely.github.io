Let's dive into the details: Chelsea are still on course for a domestic treble - despite their Women's Champions League exit

Another season, another Women's Champions League failure.

Chelsea might be closing in on a domestic treble but they appear further away than ever from triumphing in Europe.

A second 4-1 setback to Barcelona in the space of a week saw their latest attempt to land the Champions League end in an embarrassing 8-2 semi-final aggregate defeat.

Chelsea recruited Sonia Bompastor - who led Lyon to Champions League glory in 2022 - specifically to win the one trophy that had eluded former manager Emma Hayes.

Speaking last September, the Frenchwoman said: "If we don't achieve that goal I will be the one you need to blame. I am fine with that."

On Sunday, after her team had been demolished by Barca, Bompastor did not shy away from what needs to happen for Chelsea to take the next step.

"It didn't happen this year but now we need to reflect on how we make it possible," she said.

"The only positive is in my head it is really clear what we need to do to compete for the Champions League. 

"We're not shying away from the ambitions of the club."

Chelsea suffer embarrassing Champions League exit

This is the third successive season Chelsea have gone out to Barcelona at the semi-final stage. 

Whereas on the previous two occasions they lost 2-1 on aggregate, they were easily beaten this time.

In the first leg, Chelsea conceded twice in the final 10 minutes to allow the holders to establish a commanding lead that was always going to be difficult to overturn.

On Sunday, they were 3-0 down on the day, 7-1 on aggregate, before half-time.

"The gulf you have seen between the two teams is absolutely huge," former England midfielder Karen Carney told TNT Sports.

Having established a healthy first-leg advantage, fans wondered how Barcelona would approach the second leg.

From the first minute at Stamford Bridge, Barca were on the front-foot.

"This team is ridiculously good, but the defending from Chelsea has been shocking," added Carney.

Bompastor does not believe the scoreline accurately reflects the gulf between her team and Barcelona.

"Barcelona are a really good team but the difference between the teams is not that much," she added.

"One team has been clinical in both games but my team weren't."

Does another Champions League exit make Bompastor's first season a failure?

Bompastor said in her post-match news conference that it will still be a good season if Chelsea wrap up the Women's Super League title and win the FA Cup.

Having already secured the League Cup, Chelsea need four points from three games to make absolutely sure of the WSL title, while they face Manchester United at Wembley on 18 May in the FA Cup final.

"It will have been a good season [if we win those]. Not ideal or a perfect one," added Bompastor.

Former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley said it was important to remember how much the French coach has achieved in her first season.

"We have to put it into context - this is Bompastor's first season at a new club, trying to implement her philosophy and identity on a new team," she told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra.

"She's got players that she has inherited from Emma Hayes.

"I don't think you can discount what she has been able to do in a relatively short period of time. It's the standard, the level Chelsea has been accustomed to. 

"This is just that one empty shelf in that trophy cabinet that is just aching to be filled.

"It will be disappointing but I don't think the season will be a failure because of this."

Chelsea have never won the Women's Champions League

Bompastor said she knows what is needed for Chelsea to make the next step - and win the Champions League.

When pressed on Sunday, she said now was not the time to go into detail and that her focus was on Wednesday's WSL match when the Blues could win the title at Manchester United.

Captain Millie Bright said the defeat was "heartbreaking" and the team was "disheartened" but they could still take positives from it.

Asked how they close the gap to Barcelona, she told BBC Sport: "I think we're there. We've still got a lot to learn but you've seen from spells in both games we have the quality.

"It's just the technical side and making sure that when we get on top of a side like that we need to punish them. Lessons learned - you just can't make big mistakes against teams like that."

Bright added that it was vital the team picked themselves up from Sunday's crushing disappointment.

"There's still a lot to play for and we've had a fantastic season so far but unless you have anything to show for it, it means nothing."

Carney added: "I'm trying to wrap my head around where Chelsea go from now. Do you keep chasing and buying players or is it a mental or tactical thing?

"The gulf shouldn't be that big. Every individual player put in the effort they wanted to be there, but the gulf is too big and I don't really understand why. It shouldn't be 8-2."

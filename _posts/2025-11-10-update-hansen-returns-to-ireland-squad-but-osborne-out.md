Experts revealed that Ireland have Tests against Australia and South Africa remaining this month

British and Irish Lion Mack Hansen has been recalled to the Ireland squad for the side's remaining autumn Tests, but Jamie Osborne will miss out with a shoulder injury.

Ireland are back in action against Australia on Saturday in Dublin (20:10 GMT) before taking on world champions South Africa at Aviva Stadium on Saturday, 22 November (17:40 GMT).

Connacht's Hansen has rejoined the squad despite initially being considered out for the autumn series because of the foot injury he picked up in his side's United Rugby Championship loss to the Bulls last month. 

Hansen has never started at full-back for Ireland, although his past four Connacht appearances have been in the position, but with usual starter Hugo Keenan also out the former Brumbies player gives head coach Andy Farrell another option in his back three. 

Osborne wore the 15 jersey against New Zealand and Japan to start the month but was replaced by Jimmy O'Brien in the second half of the 41-10 win over the latter on Saturday and Farrell said afterwards that his shoulder injury did not "look good".

Hansen's club-mate Darragh Murray has also been called into the squad with the second row capped during the summer tour to Georgia and Portugal.

Leinster pair Garry Ringrose and Josh van der Flier remain doubts for this weekend's game against the Wallabies with hamstring strains and their progress will be monitored before the team is announced on Thursday.

There is better news on the injury front with centre Stuart McCloskey making progress with a groin injury sustained against the All Blacks and expected to take a full part in training this week.

The Wallabies will be without La Rochelle lock Will Skelton in Dublin on Saturday after the 33-year-old sustained an ankle injury for his club against Toulon in the Top 14 at the weekend.

After Australia's defeat by Italy on Saturday, Leicester Tigers fly-half James O'Connor has joined up with Joe Schmidt's squad for the visit to the Aviva Stadium.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Michelob Ultra has become the top-selling beer in the US two year's after its parent company's Bud Light brand lost the title following a consumer backlash.

Anheuser-Busch, citing data from Circana, said on Monday that Michelob Ultra overtook Modelo Especial in US retail sales by volume in the year to 14 September.

Two years ago, Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand's sales slumped after a boycott over its work with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

Meanwhile, Constellation, which owns Modelo and Corona, has previously blamed its falling beer sales on tougher US immigration policies causing a drop in Hispanic consumers in the US.

About half of the Constellation's sales come from Hispanic people in the US.

Earlier this month, Constellation cut its full-year guidance, pointing to a "challenging macroeconomic environment".

Several consumer companies have in recent months highlighted a connection between US President Donald Trump administration's stricter immigration policies and weak sales. 

Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive have also noted a slump in North American sales from Hispanic consumers.

Overall, the US beer industry has had a lacklustre year as US drinking habits are changing.

American have dialled down their beer consumption over the past four decades, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Anheuser-Busch's recent success comes after a difficult 2023.

As well as being facing boycotts for its social media work with Ms Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch response to the criticism, which included putting two executives blamed for the relationship on leave, was also criticised.

Bud Light sales sank and it lost its spot as the top-selling beer in the US after more than two decades.

Anheuser-Busch on Monday said the launch of Michelob Ultra Zero, a non-alcoholic beer, has helped propel the brand's popularity.

 The brewer has also invested in marketing for Michelob Ultra, including at the FIFA Club World Cup and other major sporting events.

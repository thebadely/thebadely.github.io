Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Luciano Spalletti was appointed Italy manager after leading Napoli to the Serie A title

Luciano Spalletti has announced his own sacking as Italy's head coach at a news conference on Sunday after his side lost 3-0 to Norway in a World Cup qualifier on Friday.

Italy conceded three first-half goals in Oslo to fall to defeat in their opening qualifier for the 2026 tournament

The 66-year-old said he would still take charge of Monday's game against Moldova, but it will be his last with the national team.

"Last night we were very together with president [Gabriele] Gravina. He told me that I will be relieved of my position as coach of the national team," said Spalletti.

"I had no intention of giving up. I would have preferred to stay in my place and continue doing my job. I'll be there tomorrow evening against Moldova, then we'll resolve the contract."

The Italian, who eventually stormed out of the news conference, has been in charge since 2023 and led the team at Euro 2024 where Italy were knocked out in the last 16 by Switzerland.

Spalletti, who has managed Napoli, Inter Milan and Roma in Serie A, has taken charge of 23 matches as Azzurri head coach and won just 11.

Italy are in Group I of Uefa World Cup qualifying alongside Norway, Moldova, Estonia and Israel.

"I'll be there tomorrow night against Moldova," added Spalletti. "These are the results under my management and I have to take responsibility.

"I love this shirt, this job and the players I've coached. Tomorrow night I'll ask them to demonstrate what I asked even if I haven't been able to get them to express their best."

Italian football journalist David Ferrini: Spalletti's departure is no surprise, not after the run of inconsistent results. The Euros loss to Switzerland was embarrassing, the Nations League debacle against Germany fuelled criticisms, and the lack of cohesion in Norway was the final straw.

The Federation was expecting stability with his appointment, but all the telltale signs of instability surfaced when Roberto Mancini was still in charge.

The lack of identity in the Italian national team is nothing new. Italy's reputation as a world football power suffered a blow in South Africa and died in Brazil. While Antonio Conte worked wonders to get Italy competitive again at the highest level, the Gian Piero Ventura tenure did untold damage.

For the first time in generations, Italian players began to doubt themselves, even against lesser sides. Making matters worse, the size of the player selection pool is at record-low levels. At times, Roberto Mancini resorted to calling up players from Serie B. He'd repeatedly complained that there weren't enough Italians playing first-tier football.

Any incoming manager is going to find it extremely difficult, even Spalletti who is renowned for being an exceptional development coach. If he can't improve things, then who really can? If he's been told by the Federation that he's being replaced, then we can only assume they've got a plan.

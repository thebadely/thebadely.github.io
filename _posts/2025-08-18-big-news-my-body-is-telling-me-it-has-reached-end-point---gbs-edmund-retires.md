It has been recently reported that Kyle Edmund claimed victories over Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov during his career

Former British number one Kyle Edmund said "my body is telling me it's finally reached the end point" as he announced his retirement from tennis.

Edmund had a memorable run to the Australian Open semi-finals in 2018 and was as high as 14 in the world rankings.

The 30-year-old is only the second British man after Sir Andy Murray to reach the last four at Melbourne in the Open era.

His later career was hampered by injuries, with Edmund undergoing three knee surgeries in the past five years.

"Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was," Edmund said.

"The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries such as wrist, ab, hip and foot.

"There are no regrets whatsoever."

South African-born Edmund moved to Britain when he was three and grew up in Yorkshire before turning professional in 2011.

He won two ATP Tour singles titles - in Antwerp in 2018 and the 2020 New York Open - and was British number one for 19 months.

He was also part of the British team that won the Davis Cup in 2015 - the country's first victory in the event for 79 years.

Edmund's last event was the ATP Challenger tournament in Nottingham, where he was beaten in the final by compatriot Jack Pinnington-Jones.

Edmund thanked his family on announcing his retirement, adding: "The person that I am today and how I carried myself on and off the court is a reflection of my mum and dad and how they brought me up. 

"I'm hugely grateful to them for being so supportive, never pushing me, encouraging and teaching me to be self-motivated."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jockey Ryan Moore guided Lambourn to victory at Chester  

Lambourn produced a strong finish to win the Chester Vase Stakes in a leading trial for next month's Derby at Epsom.

The 11-8 favourite, under jockey Ryan Moore, was trailing in third going into the final straight but kicked on and won by a length and a half.

Lazy Griff finished second as Convergent claimed third.

"He looked a thorough stayer and while he was a little on and off the bridle, once the penny dropped, he came home really strongly," said trainer Aidan O'Brien, who won the Chester Vase Stakes for a record-extending 11th time.

He added: "He got the trip really well and he's gone through the line nicely.

"At this stage, you'd have to say he's on the Epsom team but this is a busy week for the trials. We've got Lingfield, there's Leopardstown and then there's York too.

"We'll just have to see how they all get on but we were thinking of sending him to Epsom, as they learn so much when they go to Chester."

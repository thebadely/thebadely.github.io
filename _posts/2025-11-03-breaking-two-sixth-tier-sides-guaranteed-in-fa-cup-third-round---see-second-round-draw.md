Experts revealed that Brackley were one of four National League sides to beat EFL opposition during Saturday's first-round fixtures

Two sides from the sixth-tier of the English football pyramid are guaranteed to be in this season's FA Cup third round following Monday's second-round draw.

National League South's Slough Town were the first team to be pulled out and will host Macclesfield of National League North.

Chelmsford City, who dispatched local rivals Braintree Town 4-1 at the weekend to make the second round, have a home tie against fellow National League South side Weston-super-Mare.

Elsewhere, Bristol Rovers boss Darrell Clarke goes back to his former club Port Vale and National League side Gateshead host League Two leaders Walsall.

Following their dramatic 4-3 victory against Forest Green Rovers on Friday, Jack Wilshere's Luton Town travel to the north west coast for a tie at Fleetwood Town.

Brackley Town are at home to League One Burton Albion and National League side Wealdstone visit Grimsby Town.

2013 winners Wigan Athletic, who needed a penalty shootout to overcome Hemel Hempstead Town in the first round, are treated to a home tie against League Two Barrow.

Following their extra-time heroics, National League North club Buxton go to League Two strugglers Cheltenham Town. 

The ties will be played across the weekend of 6-7 December.

Holders Crystal Palace and the rest of the clubs playing in the Premier League and Championship will enter the competition in the third round in the new year.

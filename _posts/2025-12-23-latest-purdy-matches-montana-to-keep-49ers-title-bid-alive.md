Brock Purdy helps keep 49ers title bid alive with victory against Colts

Quarterback Brock Purdy threw a career-high five touchdown passes as the San Francisco 49ers beat the Indianapolis Colts 48-27 to keep their NFC West title hopes alive.

The 25-year-old completed 25 of his 34 passes for 295 yards as the 49ers extended their winning streak to five matches.

Running back Christian McCaffrey caught two of the touchdown passes as the 49ers saw off a spirited Colts side.

Purdy became the first 49ers quarterback to throw five touchdowns in a game since the legendary Joe Montana in 1990.

The 49ers head into their final two regular-season matches - against the Chicago Bears and NFC West leaders the Seattle Seahawks - knowing two victories will secure the divisional title and home advantage in the play-offs.

The Colts' fifth consecutive defeat means they drop out of the AFC South title race - although they could still secure a wildcard spot.

The result also guarantees post-season qualification for the Buffalo Bills, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Los Angeles Chargers.

The Colts opened the scoring when 44-year-old emergency quarterback Philip Rivers threw to Alec Pierce, who finished with four catches for 86 yards. 

However, Purdy quickly seized control for the visitors, throwing touchdown passes to Demarcus Robinson and McCaffrey in quick succession in the first quarter. 

Although Rivers and Pierce combined again early in the second quarter to level the scores, Purdy picked out George Kittle with an 11-yard pass to help the 49ers to a 24-17 lead at half-time.

Purdy then found Jauan Jennings and McCaffrey either side of a one-yard touchdown for Colts running back Jonathan Taylor as the 49ers maintained their advantage. 

With fewer than four minutes remaining, San Francisco linebacker Dee Winters returned a 74-yard interception for his side's sixth touchdown to wrap up the win.

According to new developments, Kevin has featured for Brazil at Under-20 level

Fulham have completed a club-record Â£34.6m deal to sign Shakhtar Donetsk winger Kevin.

The Brazilian, 22, has penned a five-year contract with the Cottagers, who have the option to extend it by a further year.

"I am happy to be in the biggest league in the world, at a huge club, too," said Kevin. 

"I'm very flattered for everything that's happening in my life, and I hope to score a lot of goals this season and do great work here in Fulham."

Kevin scored 17 goals in 57 matches in all competitions for the Ukrainian side and is the second wide player to head to Craven Cottage on deadline day.

Earlier on Monday evening, Fulham announced the loan signing of Samuel Chukwueze from AC Milan and had also agreed a Â£22m move for Chelsea forward Tyrique George until it collapsed in the late hours.

Chukwueze, 26, arrived in west London having scored eight goals in 70 appearances for the seven-time European champions.

The Nigerian international, who moved to the San Siro in 2023, previously played 206 times for Villarreal, but missed their penalty shootout win over Manchester United in the 2021 Europa League final due to injury.

"I'm so happy to be here, it's an amazing club. It feels like home, because I have my people around me," said Chukwueze.

"I feel at home already, and I can't wait to get started."

George's move fell through as he was a contingency plan in case Leeds made an offer Fulham couldn't refuse for Harry Wilson, but ultimately they preferred to keep the Wales international.

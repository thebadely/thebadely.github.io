Let's dive into the details: The government is set to announce its intention to build a new rail link between Birmingham and Manchester, the BBC understands.

Previous plans for the HS2 high-speed rail line had included a line between the two cities, but that part of the project was scrapped by Rishi Sunak's government.

On Wednesday, the government is also expected to confirm proposals for new and improved rail links across the North of England in a scheme known as Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR).

Little detail about a new Birmingham to Manchester route is anticipated, other than the intention to build it after NPR is completed, meaning it may not happen for decades.

The existing West Coast main line is very crowded and ministers acknowledge the need to increase capacity at some point.  

Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has supported the idea of an alternative new line between Birmingham and Manchester.

That will now wait until after a series of other improvements have been made improving travel between northern cities.

Plans for new east-west rail links across the north of England were first put forward by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne in 2014.

A new rail line between Liverpool and Manchester is seen a central piece of the overall Northern Powerhouse rail project, which is aimed at cutting travel times between northern cities and towns as well as boosting the UK economy outside of London.

But expected announcements from the current government were put on ice several times last year due to cost concerns.

Insiders said an extended review process of the project was under way in a bid to avoid mistakes made with HS2, which has been dogged by problems and costly delays.

HS2 is currently tens of billions of pounds over budget and around a decade behind schedule.

Reports state that the now-shortened line between Birmingham and London could cost £81bn.

Accounting for inflation, that would mean at least £100bn will be spent but only 135 miles of railway built.

HS2 Ltd, the company created by the Department for Transport, has accepted it failed to keep overall costs under control and said delivery has not matched what it described as the unrealistic early expectations.

The Conservatives said Labour had "no ability to follow through on its promises".

Shadow Rail Minister Jerome Mayhew said: "Labour have spent months talking up Northern Powerhouse Rail, yet today they've put back any plans to actually deliver it and rewritten timetables on the fly.

"Northern Powerhouse Rail could have been transformational, empowering regional growth and regeneration. 

"Under Labour it risks becoming a permanent mirage that is endlessly redesigned, downgraded and never delivered."

Let's dive into the details: Manchester United invested heavily in new players over the summer

Manchester United took on an extra Â£105m of debt to help fund their summer transfer spending, taking the amount they now owe to almost Â£1.1bn.

United released club accounts up to 30 June 2025 on 17 September.

More detailed information was then released to the New York Stock Exchange on 18 September when the club outlined some of their business after the initial reporting date.

United say they spent Â£167.8m on new players after 30 June. They signed Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford on 21 July, Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig on 9 August and Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on 1 September. They had already signed Brazil forward Matheus Cunha from Wolves for Â£62.5m in June.

In the latest financial statement, the club confirmed their debt was Â£637m on 30 June 2025. This was made up of the historic senior secured notes and secured term loan facility which are a legacy of the Glazer takeover in 2005, plus revolving credit, which they have recently increased by Â£50m so Â£350m is available if required.

However, they also detail four additional drawdowns from the revolving credit facility between 7 July and 11 September totalling Â£105m, taking the sum accessed from this to Â£265m. This takes the debt to Â£742m.

This figure is increased when you add in the Â£447m United say they owe in transfer fees, Â£205m of which is due after one year. United also confirm they are owed Â£102.61m.

While staggering transfer fee payments over an extended period of time is now common practice across the Premier League, in total it means United now owe Â£1.087bn in various forms.

Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has implemented cost-cutting measures which in part led to a reduction in United's losses from Â£113.2m to Â£33m.

However, the lack of success on the pitch is hampering further improvement.

United made Â£43.7m from their run to last season's Europa League final.

This season, when they will have no European income, they expect their overall revenue to be between Â£640m and Â£660m.

Despite the new arrivals, Ruben Amorim's side have won just one game so far this season.

Ratcliffe flew to the club's Carrington training ground on Thursday for a series of pre-planned meetings, including one with the under-pressure head coach.

Sources have previously said the ownership remain supportive of Amorim, whose side play Chelsea in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Saturday, 20 September (17:30 BST).

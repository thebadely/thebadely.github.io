Let's dive into the details: Adolescence star Owen Cooper has made Emmys history by becoming one of  the youngest ever to be nominated by the prestigious TV US television academy.

The 15-year-old British actor has bagged a nomination for best supporting actor in a limited/anthology series or TV movie. If he wins, Cooper will be the youngest male winner of an acting Emmy.

The teen will go up against his co-star Ashley Walters from the hit Netflix show, while two actresses from the critically-acclaimed series, Christine Tremarco and Erin Doherty, will compete in the equivalent supporting actress category. 

The show's leading star, Stephen Graham, is up for best actor, while the four-parter about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, is also in the running for outstanding limited series. Jack Thorne, who created the drama  with Graham, is nominated for a best writing prize.

While Adolescence has a respectable 13 nods, leading the pack is workplace satire Severance with 27 nominations, followed by Batman spin-off The Penguin (24), and black comedy drama The White Lotus (23). 

Four stars from The White Lotus - Carrie Coon, Parker Posey, Natasha Rothwell and Aimee Lou Wood - face one another for the supporting actress in a drama series award.

Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Harrison Ford (Shrinking) and Jeremy Allen White (The Bear) are among the stars competing for the top acting prizes in the comedy categories.

Brunson is also up for a writing prize while this is a first Emmy nod for Ford, at the tender age of 83.

The Studio, The Bear, Abbott Elementary and Shrinking are among the contenders for best comedy series.

RuPaul has now became the most nominated reality host in Emmys history for his show RuPaul's Drag Race.

Let's dive into the details: Three first-half goals helped England to a routine 3-0 victory in Thursday's international friendly against Wales at Wembley.

BBC Sport football news reporter Alex Howell and BBC Sport Wales journalist Dafydd Pritchard assessed how the players performed - and you can see how BBC Sport readers rated them at the bottom of the page too.

Jordan Pickford: A history-making night for the keeper as he broke the record he shared with Gordon Banks for the number of consecutive clean sheets, which now stands at eight. Made a smart save to deny David Brooks, but didn't have much more to trouble him. 6

Ezri Konsa: The Aston Villa defender was moved to right-back as John Stones came into the centre and the absence of the injured Reece James. Konsa looked solid as he has done in the past when playing in that position for England and offered an attacking outlet. Not tested defensively. 6

John Stones:  His first match under Thomas Tuchel since he became England manager. Stones stepped into midfield to start attacks and it was an extremely comfortable return to international football after his injury troubles. 6

Marc Guehi: The Crystal Palace defender was his usual composed self at centre-back. Produced a great piece of play to keep the ball in and set up Morgan Rogers for his opening goal. Guehi must be a first-choice defender for England. 7

Djed Spence: Not anything of note to deal with defensively on his first start for England. A good outlet in attack and continues to be a versatile asset. 6

Declan Rice: Captain for the night and lived up to the honour. Bossed the midfield with his running power and dictated the game with his passing. His corners and free-kicks were always quality. 8

Elliot Anderson: Continues to make the number six position his own. Plays with maturity but still only 22. Has a real chance to become a key part of the England team. 7

Morgan Rogers: A favourite of Tuchel and one of the big options as a number 10. A great moment for him to score his first England goal and his powerful running caused Wales problems throughout the match. 8

Bukayo Saka: The Arsenal winger was a constant threat on the right wing - just as he is for his club. He scored the goal of the match with a real moment of quality when he cut in on his left foot and curled a shot into the top corner. 8

Anthony Gordon: Started the match on the left wing and was then moved to striker after Ollie Watkins was withdrawn. He played with his usual energy and pace and contributed to a solid win. 7

Ollie Watkins: A goal for Watkins. He hasn't played much under Tuchel but the Villa front man took his chance when it came and is the clear backup for captain Harry Kane. But missed another good opportunity and a collision with a post led to injury and a half-time withdrawal. 7

Marcus Rashford: The game was won when he was introduced at half-time and Wales were a lot more compact, which meant he didn't have much space to run into. Gordon tried to set him up for a tap-in but the ball was cut out. 6

Ruben Loftus-Cheek: The AC Milan midfielder came on for his first appearance since 2018 when Tuchel changed the midfield three. Kept it simple. 6

Morgan Gibbs-White: Came on for the final 20 minutes but with all the substitutions from both sides, the game was disjointed. Still tried to make things happen like he always does. 6

Jordan Henderson: Brought on as the deepest midfielder and for his experience. Very vocal as always and tried to keep the standards high when the game was won. 6

Jarrod Bowen: Introduced on the right wing and had one positive run which ended with him playing in Gordon for a strike. 6 

Myles Lewis-Skelly: A late replacement for Stones. Comfortable recieving the ball in tight spaces and another appearance for the 19-year-old. 6

Karl Darlow: Powerless to stop England's flurry of early goals and made a decent low save from Anthony Gordon before the floodgates opened. 6

Jay Dasilva: Struggled to contain the elusive Saka and did not see enough of the ball to make an impression going forward. 5

Joe Rodon: Kept busy by the barrage of England attacks, heading and blocking everything that came his way. 6

Ben Davies: His misjudgement allowed Guehi to set up the opening goal, a rare mistake for one of Wales' greats and now just one cap away from becoming a centurion. 5

Neco Williams: Had a difficult time against the lively Gordon, getting booked too for a lunging tackle on the Newcastle United winger. Not his usual influential self. 4

Ethan Ampadu: Usually the heartbeat of the team in midfield but did not have the support around him in the face of world-class opposition. 5

Liam Cullen: Asked to play in a deeper role in midfield again, the Swansea City forward looked out of his depth and was unable to stop England's runners. 4

David Brooks: Looked as likely as anyone to spark a Welsh counter-attack. Had a shot on target with a second-half volley and provided substitute Mark Harris with an excellent cross for a good opportunity. 6

Harry Wilson: One of Wales' outstanding players of recent years but, on this occasion, limited to one speculative long-range effort which went over. 5

Brennan Johnson: Offered nothing in attack and did little to support Williams defensively. 4

Kieffer Moore: Ran himself ragged closing down defenders and chasing lost causes, but was isolated as Wales' lone striker. 5

Chris Mepham: Replaced Davies and defended solidly and forced Pickford into an excellent save with a diving header. 6

Ronan Kpakio: Gave Wales some energy and impetus on the right after coming on for Williams, combining well with Brooks. 6

Josh Sheehan: Looked after the ball tidily enough as he usually does at the base of midfield when he replaced Ampadu. 6

Jordan James: Improved Wales as a midfield force with his dynamism and work-rate when coming on for Wilson. 6

Mark Harris: Sent a header over following a wonderful Brooks cross. 5

Lewis Koumas: Tried to run at opposition defenders after replacing Johnson, but had limited opportunities to do so. 5

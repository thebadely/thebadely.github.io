According to new developments, Anthony Cacace defended his IBO super-featherweight title

Belfast's Anthony Cacace retained his IBO super-featherweight title with a ninth-round stoppage of Leigh Wood at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena on Saturday.

It was a gripping battle between the two 36-year-olds, which appeared on a knife-edge until Cacace made the big breakthrough and he was in no mood to let the home favourite off the hook.

Wood is noted for his powers of recovery, highlighted by his remarkable come-from-behind victory over Michael Conlan three years ago in the same venue.

But this time it was beyond him with Cacace ruthlessly closing the show as Wood's corner threw in the towel just as it seemed referee John Latham was about to wave it off.

After the victory, the Northern Irishman's record now stands at 24 wins and one defeat from 25 fights. 

Anthony Cacace's record is now 24-1

Wood began confidently off the jab as he sought to assert himself, but was snapped back on a couple of occasions from Cacace's right hands and again towards the end of the opener as there was a sense both men could land something decisive.

Neither could afford to get reckless as there was clear respect between the pair, but Wood walked into a right hand in the second round which made him think twice.

But he did get his best shot off in the dying seconds as he found a home for his own right hand which brought a respectful nod from Cacace.

They landed simultaneously in the third before Cacace appeared to make the first bit of a dent as he got through with one of his trademark uppercuts. After briefly switching to southpaw, he thumped home a left hand which seemed to drive Wood back, but was caught late in the round when missing the target and punished by a counter.

There was an air of tension as the fight proceeded, although Wood enjoyed a good fourth round as he found his range.

It remained on a knife-edge in the fifth with Cacace's stiff jab rocking Wood's head back, but the Nottingham man responded well to have his own success.

Cacace grabbed some momentum with a good sixth round as he got through with another uppercut and seemed to be opening up by putting punches together, but was caught in the seventh when switching stances.

Early in the eighth, Cacace suffered a setback with blood beginning to pour from his nose, but Wood was made to eat a solid left up close as they began to trade blows late on.

The Englishman sought a fast start to the ninth round but it proved his undoing.

Perhaps getting a little too excited, he left himself exposed and Cacace pounced and a strong right hand appeared to have a delayed impact as Wood stumbled backwards and, with the ropes keeping him up, referee Latham gave a count.

Cacace didn't let him off the hook as he meticulously broke Wood's resistance, thudding home some punishing shots and the towel came in from his corner to save him from an inevitable KO.

Earlier, Lisburn's Kurt Walker tasted defeat for the first time as he was outpointed by Liam Davies in their battle for the vacant IBF International featherweight title.

The scorecards read 117-111, 115-113 and 116-112 in favour of Englishman Davies on his return to action after his own maiden defeat on points by Shabaz Masoud last November at super-bantamweight.

This time, the 29-year-old managed to get the job done in a close contest, despite a good final push from Walker.

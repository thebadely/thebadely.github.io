Lawrence's winning touchdown as Jaguars beat Chiefs 31-28

Quarterback Trevor Lawrence scored a one-yard touchdown with 23 seconds left to give the Jacksonville Jaguars a dramatic 31-28 win against the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL.

Lawrence slipped before getting up and diving over the line as the Jaguars improved their record to 4-1 for the season for the first time since 2007.

"Just panic. Sheer panic," said Lawrence. "On the ground; we didn't have any timeouts; got stepped on coming out. I was like, 'I've just got to get up'.

"I was going to throw it out of bounds and stop the clock and there was really no-one around me, so went and made a play."

Lawrence completed 18 of 25 passes for 221 yards, ran 54 yards, scored another touchdown and threw for one at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville as the Jaguars ended an eight-game losing streak against the Chiefs dating back to 2009.

The Chiefs led 14-0 after touchdowns from Travis Kelce and quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

The Jaguars levelled thanks to Parker Washington and Lawrence touchdowns, but Devin Lloyd intercepted a Mahomes pass and ran a 99-yard touchdown to put the hosts 21-14 up.

Two Kareem Hunt touchdowns - the second with one minute 45 seconds remaining - gave the Chiefs a 28-24 lead before Lawrence's late intervention.

Mahomes threw for 318 yards and ran a team-high 60 yards but the Chiefs - Super Bowl winners in 2020, 2023 and 2024 - suffered a third loss in five games.

"We've lost too many games already," he said. "We've got to find a way to be better as a team, come together and play better throughout the rest of the season."

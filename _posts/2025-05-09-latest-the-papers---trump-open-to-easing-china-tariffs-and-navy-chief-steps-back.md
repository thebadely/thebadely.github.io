Let's dive into the details: Claims that the head of the Royal Navy, Adm Sir Ben Key, was suspended from his job because of an affair with a female officer are the focus of some of the front pages. The Sun - which first reported the development - says he's suspected of breaking the Navy's strict "service test" which the paper explains "outlaws sexual relationships between commanders and their subordinates". 

According to the Daily Mail, it is the first time in the organisation's 500 year history that its First Sea Lord is facing a misconduct inquiry. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed an investigation is "ongoing" but that it would be inappropriate to comment further.

The Guardian reports that Sir Keir Starmer has "ambitious" plans to secure a closer trading partnership with the EU. In an interview with the paper, the prime minister has said he believes the public have moved on from Brexit, and people should be looking forward, not back.

The Times reports on Home Office forecasts for net migration, and suggestions the annual figure will be closer to 525,000 in 2028 - above the 340,000 level expected by the government. The paper says the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, will publish the government's immigration white paper next week.

Most of the papers cover yesterday's guilty verdict of the two men who cut down the world famous Sycamore Gap tree near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland in 2023. Daniel Graham will be sentenced next month. 

"Sycamorons" declares the Daily Star, while the Daily Mirror reads: "Mindless". The Sun runs with "Saw" - spelt S-A-W - "losers" for its headline.

Meanwhile, the Times argues that the pair's behaviour is "hard to fathom" and "impossible to excuse". Its editorial goes on to say "boneheaded" and "nihilistic stupidity" requires no further analysis, and instead turns to the encouraging news that the stump of the Sycamore Gap tree has shown signs of regrowth. The paper says this is a sign nature is healing.

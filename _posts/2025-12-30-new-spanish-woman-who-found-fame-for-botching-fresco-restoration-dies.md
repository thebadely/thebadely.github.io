According to new developments, The Spanish parishioner who made headlines around the world for her botched restoration of a prized Jesus Christ fresco has died aged 94.

Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman from Borja, northeast Spain, became famous 13 years ago after she attempted to restore the century-old painting titled Ecce Homo that was held in her local church.

Giménez's restoration went viral and earned the nickname "Monkey Christ", because of Christ's head resembling a hairy monkey. 

The 94-year-old's death was confirmed by Borja's major, Eduardo Arilla, in a Facebook post, in which he recognised her as a "great lover of painting from a young age".

Arilla paid tribute to Giménez's "famous restoration of Ecce Homo" in August 2012, which "due to the poor state of conservation it presented, Cecilia, with the best intentions, decided to repaint the work over".

The Ecce Homo ("Behold the Man" in Latin) by 19th century painter Elias Garcia Martinez has been held for more than 100 years in the Sanctuary of Mercy Church near Zaragoza. 

In 2012, Giménez, then 81, told BBC News that church members had "always repaired everything here", and that she had permission from the local priest to do so. 

Giménez said at the time anybody who entered the Church would have seen she was painting over the original. 

The impact of the restoration led to the "Monkey Christ" meme and saw the once quiet town of Borja quickly become a tourist destination. 

The town, which had previously welcomed just 5,000 visitors per year, received more than 40,000 tourists by 2013, and raised more than €50,000 for charity at the time. 

Today, officials say that between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists per year visit Borja to see the famous portrait, which is now behind a protective shield of glass.

After recovering from the backlash, with support from local residents  and others around the world, Giménez went on to stage an art exhibition with 28 of her own paintings. 

She was praised by Borja's major for her generosity and years of dedication to the church. 

"Rest in peace Cecilia, we will always remember you," Arilla wrote on Facebook.

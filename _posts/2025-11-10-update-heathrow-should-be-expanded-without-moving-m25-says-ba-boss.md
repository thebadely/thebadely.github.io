Here’s what you need to know: Heathrow Airport should be expanded without moving the M25 motorway, the CEO of British Airways Sean Doyle has said.

The government is considering two proposals to expand Heathrow - one from the airport itself and another from the Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora.

The airport's owners want to build a full-length 3,500m (2.2-mile) runway, which would involve diverting the M25, while Arora Group is seeking permission for a 2,800m runway, negating the need to move the motorway. 

A decision on which developer will build Heathrow's third runway is due by the end of the month.

In the summer, Heathrow Airport revealed its £49bn plans to build a third runway and accompanying infrastructure, including a new road tunnel under the airport, and widening the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15.

Arora Group's bid includes proposals for a shorter runway, with no need to alter the M25, with a lower price tag of £25bn. But additional infrastructure would be needed.

Speaking at the Airlines 2025 conference in Westminster on Monday, Mr Doyle said: "If you can avoid moving the M25, you should avoid moving the M25.

"I can't argue against the logic of that.

"I think we should look at ways of potentially building a shorter runway."

The proposal from Heathrow's owners would require a new M25 tunnel and bridges to be built 130m to the west of the existing motorway.

Traffic would be switched to the new route during overnight closures.

The applicants behind both expansion proposals have been asked by the government to provide further details of their plans, relating to the impact for investors, affected communities and businesses.

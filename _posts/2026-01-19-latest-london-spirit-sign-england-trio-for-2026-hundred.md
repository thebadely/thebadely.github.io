Let's dive into the details: London Spirit won the women's title in 2024 but have never lifted the men's trophy

England trio Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton and Charlie Dean are among the new signings made by London Spirit for the 2026 Hundred season.

Spirit, who are based at Lord's, have made eight signings in total, with Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa and big-hitting South Africa batter Dewald Brevis also joining the men's team.

Australia's Grace Harris remains at the franchise alongside Dean, while seamer Mahika Gaur and South Africa legend Marizanne Kapp have also been added to the women's squad which will be led by ex-England head coach Jon Lewis.

Kapp, 36, joins from Oval Invincibles, for whom she was named player of the match in the 2022 final of The Hundred. She has taken 46 wickets in The Hundred, the fourth-highest tally in the competition's history.

"It is brilliant to be able to call upon players of such calibre in the women's game," said Lewis.

"I am delighted London Spirit fans will see the return of two favourites in Charlie and Grace, and I know Mahika and Marizanne will provide real skill and experience to our bowling attack."

All Hundred teams are allowed to directly sign or retain four players before the auction - a new addition for this season - which is set to take place in March.

Brevis, 22, holds the highest individual T20 score in South Africa after he smashed 161 from 57 balls in the CSA T20 Challenge in 2022. He will be making his debut in The Hundred.

Livingstone moves from Birmingham Phoenix, having been named as the men's player of the tournament in 2021, while Overton gets the chance to build on the 2025 season when he finished as Spirit's leading wicket-taker.

Zampa has taken 30 wickets at an average of 13.13 in The Hundred. No player has taken more wickets at a lower average.

Elsewhere, Southern Brave has retained England fast bowler Jofra Archer and signed wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who play for Spirit last year.

Lauren Bell, who is impressing in India's Women's Premier League currently, remains with the 2023 champions, as does batter Maia Bouchier. 

Meanwhile, New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner and Australia seamer Kim Garth have become Trent Rockets' final two direct signings.

Left-armer Santner, 33, has taken more than 250 shortest-format wickets at an average of just 23.96, and has been his country's white-ball captain since December 2024.

Alongside him, 29-year-old Garth is set for a second stint in The Hundred, after previously turning out for Manchester Originals (now Manchester Super Giants) in 2024.

It has been recently reported that Another huge day in the EFL with surprise results and emphatic victories. 

Sheffield United didn't get off to the start they hoped for under Chris Wilder as they were beaten by Charlton, while Queens Park Rangers continued their resurgence with a win over high-flying Stoke City.

Wrexham have continued to ruffle Championship feathers while Bradford City and Gillingham have set their stalls out in Leagues One and Two.

Sheffield United sacked Ruben Selles and rehired Chris Wilder for a third spell as manager less than two months after ending his second, but his team were beaten 1-0 in the 90th minute at Bramall Lane by Charlton.

Parkin: "A lot of people were expecting the crowd and players to respond to Chris Wilder coming back. There are clearly issues at Sheffield United. Not issues that can't be overcome because it is so early in the season, but there is obviously a lack of confidence and chemistry. 

"It is alarming to lose seven games straight at any level of football. It wasn't going to be a quick fix.

"Creatively they are lacking. They've only scored once in the league; they didn't lose loads from last year but Jesurun Rak-Sakyi for one, Kieffer Moore, trying to rekindle what [Gustavo] Hamer did last year will be one of Wilder's main focuses. He is a game changer.

"They are a team who don't know what they are right now, whereas Charlton and Nathan Jones absolutely do know what they're about."

Phil Parkinson's Wrexham moved up to 15th in the Championship

Wrexham beat Norwich 3-2 at Carrow Road to move level on points with the Canaries thanks to Josh Windass' brace and Ryan Longman's strike.

Parkin: "There were wholesale changes for Phil Parkinson this season, not in style but certainly personnel. They've got a good squad and has the ability to change things. 

"That is the sign of a good manager; he has been getting criticised but to be adaptable with his starting line-up is a start. It proved really productive.

"Norwich are probably a really good team for them to face because they are giving up so many chances. 

"Wrexham are creating chances but defensively they have not been good enough. I've no doubt they will score goals but it about being better at the back. 

"They just about got the job done. I've no real concerns about Wrexham because the squad is so strong."

Harvey Vale scored his first QPR goal against Stoke

Queens Park Rangers looked hapless in their 7-1 defeat to Coventry a few weeks ago, but Saturday's 1-0 win over Stoke was their third in a row since.

Parkin: "The Coventry defeat is probably the earliest line in the sand of the season for QPR. The manager had to rethink one or two things.

"The front line at QPR looks really good now. Ruman Burrell and Richard Kone have got the headlines in the last few games but Harvey Vale has been playing well and got his maiden goal today. There is a lot of excitement and Julien Stephan has shown a degree of flexibility.

"They were losing possession a lot in the early weeks but that seems to have been fixed; the instructions for the players seem to be a lot more simplistic and they've got a lot of pace and quality at the front of the pitch. They managed things really well today. 

"Three wins on the bounce after a subdued start should be cause for optimism."

Bradford went top of League One after a 3-1 victory at Cardiff, the Welsh side's first defeat of the season after relegation from the Championship this season.

Parkin: "I wasn't overly surprised by this result despite Cardiff's promising start to the season. Bradford are a really good team; they play with an intensity that was going to disrupt Cardiff.

"Cardiff have switched to being a really high-possession team under Brian Barry-Murphy. They've been really patient in the build up and Bradford are the sort of team that swarm all over the opposition. 

"They are a strong side, and they've quality as well. There is consistency with the system from last season, continuity with the manager, brilliant at Valley Parade.

"I've got no doubts Bradford could be a top-half side, maybe even better. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a crack at another promotion."

Gareth Ainsworth took over at Gillingham in March

Gareth Ainsworth's Gillingham came from behind to beat Newport 3-1 and continue their excellent start as they sit top of League Two.

Parkin: "It was another show of real strength, coming from behind early and could have gone 2-0 down. They showed resilience, scoring goals to turn around deficits has been a feature at the start of the season.

"They've got really quality in forward areas, with two great options to play behind the striker in Bradley Dack and Jonny Williams. Dack came up trumps today.

"Gillingham have momentum and a manager who is so intense and demanding. I've got no doubt they'll be in the promotion reckoning come the end of the season. Gareth Ainsworth deserves great credit."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leigh are unbeaten in seven meetings with Castleford

Leigh Leopards rose to third in the Super League and inflicted a fifth consecutive defeat on Castleford Tigers.

Tries from Frankie Halton, Lachlan Lam, Keanan Brand and Josh Charnley meant the hosts were out of sight by the 26th minute with a 24-0 lead.

Castleford, who are being led by interim coach Chris Chester before Ryan Carr takes over on a permanent basis for 2026, remain second from bottom of the table after their 19th league defeat of the season.

Helped by resting players in their 38-6 win over bottom side Salford six days earlier, Leigh took a fourth-minute lead when the restored Halton collected Lam's pass after Brand narrowly failed to score.

That set the tone for a dominant display, Leigh looking sharper in every department than opponents beaten 38-4 at Catalans Dragons on Saturday, and scoring again when Isaac Liu's productive work set up Lam, who dummied a pass to Brand and beat Louis Senior to cross the line.

Papua New Guinea international Lam profited on the right again five minutes later, combining slickly with Umyla Hanley to set up Brand to finish the move in composed fashion, Gareth O'Brien adding more points from an unpromising angle.

The returning Frankie Halton helped Leigh move a point behind second-placed Wigan and five shy of leaders Hull Kingston Rovers with three games remaining

After a deft 40/20 kick by Lam, Charnley scored on the left to take the wing's career total to 1,500 points, including 244 during his three-year spell with the Leopards and 862 for Wigan Warriors between 2010 and 2016.

O'Brien again embellished the scoreline from an impressive distance, proving head coach Adrian Lam's prediction correct about his returning players being far better for a break.

Hooker Edwin Ipape, who has been one of those players building their fitness, joined Liu in dictating play, while Castleford were hampered by losing prop forward Tom Amone to a twisted ankle early on.

The second half started in quieter fashion, with Leigh making noticeably more unforced errors, including two shortly after the break by Jack Hughes.

Halton almost ended a 26-minute gap between the fourth and fifth tries but seconds later Lam played in Alec Tuitavake to burst through at close range and put Leigh firmly on course for their largest-ever win in this fixture, eclipsing their 30-6 home victory in 2023.

Tuitavake's try seemed to deflate the Tigers, who conceded again five minutes later after a review disagreed with Castleford's appeals that scorer Brad Dwyer had been offside when the move began.

Cain Robb could not stop Tuitavake powering past him from 10 yards for his second two minutes later, although Castleford swiftly scored a consolation through Tex Moy following Liam Horne's driving run.

Hanley replied in kind, surging through before Lam supplied another clever pass for Brand's second try on the right.

Leigh's fourth successive win in this fixture strengthens their chase for a first-ever top-four finish, and home advantage in the play-offs, although Lam might be concerned about the absence of the influential Owen Trout through injury.

Castleford have now lost their past five away games and have conceded 224 points across their past five games.

Leigh earned their 16th win of the season

Leigh Leopards head coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It was one that we needed. I'm proud of the boys. We put a lot of fresh faces back in the team and that brought us a lot of enthusiasm. [A guaranteed top-six finish] is a really big milestone.

"I love the way we started - that's something we've been working really hard on. Lachy Lam and Gaz O'Brien really gave us control with their roles.

"Lam was outstanding. We need him firing at this time of the season. That's why he's on the big bucks.

"Aaron Pene and Alec Tuitavake also did some good stuff for us. Owen Trout and Joe Ofahengaue being out is big for us, but they did a really good job."

Castleford Tigers interim coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds:

"The game was done at half-time. Physically, we were nowhere near. Leigh have a very, very simple game plan at times - you've just got to front up and get your bodies in front, and we didn't for that first 40 minutes.

"I think it's pretty obvious that the mindset needs to change on and off the field.

"It's sad, really, where we are at as a club. We've got to rebuild. We've got a passionate board of directors and I want some passionate players. I want some men who are going to front-up every week.

"I'm lost, to be honest. I can't work some of these guys out. It's very difficult. It's hard with that performance tonight. I need it to [mean] more than what it does to people.

"With the players that we've signed and are going to announce, I'm very optimistic that we will be thereabouts in '26."

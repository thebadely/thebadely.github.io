Let's dive into the details: Andres Iniesta won the World Cup for Spain in 2010

The team formerly known as Israel-Premier Tech have been taken over by a branding company co-founded by Barcelona legend and World Cup winner Andres Iniesta.

It was announced on Thursday evening the team had changed ownership and registered as Swiss, following their Israeli owners being the subject of several pro-Palestinian protests and the loss of their title sponsor.

The team will now be known as NSN Cycling from 2026, and say they are "a Swiss team with a Spanish structure".

In a statement, which suggested they had been sold by the Israeli owners - although this has not been formally confirmed to BBC Sport after a request for comment - the team said they had made an "acquisition of the team's [governing competition] licence, and subsequent role in the team's operations".

NSN, which stands for Never Say Never, is a company co-founded by Iniesta, and claims to "connect global audiences through the power of sports and entertainment".

Former title sponsor Premier Tech ended its association this month, despite the team initially agreeing to remove Israel from their name. 

The team had agreed to the change in October after public pressure from the Canadian company, citing pro-Palestinian protests during the Vuelta a Espana in September - many of which were directed towards Israel-Premier Tech.

Canadian rider Derek Gee also cancelled his contract with the team days before the Vuelta, citing "serious concerns".

Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome signed for the team in 2020, but was released last week following serious injuries sustained in a training accident this year.

Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams has been co-owner of Israel-Premier Tech since 2014, but recently stepped back from day-to-day operations following controversy surrounding the team during the Vuelta as a result of the Israel-Gaza conflict. 

The conflict was sparked by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed.

Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,00 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

'Weighed heavily on my conscience'  - why Gee left Israeli team

Final stage of Vuelta abandoned because of protests

Iniesta is known primarily for a trophy-laden career with Barcelona and Spain, including scoring the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final in South Africa.

An integral part of football's game-changing tiki-taka dominance, the 41-year-old has become active in business since his retirement and known to enjoy the ever-growing discipline of gravel cycling.

Cycling, and road cycling in particular, is considered one of the next areas of significant global growth in elite sport, with many of the sport's figureheads calling for a new financial model to be established. 

Although not directly referenced in statements, Gee said riding for the Israeli-owned team "weighed heavily on his conscience", and said he is now the subject of a 30m euros (Â£26m) damages claim for breach of contract from the team. 

It is not clear whether this dispute is ongoing now the team's ownership appears to have changed hands.

Gee, a popular figure in the sport, was considered one of the former team's best riders, having finished fourth in May's Giro d'Italia.

Adams' involvement in Israeli politics is well known, telling BBC Sport in 2020 he is a "self-appointed ambassador to Israel". 

He supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on a trip to the White House to oversee the signing of an accord between Arab nations and Israel during US President Donald Trump's first term in 2020.

The protests during the Vuelta affected several of the 21 stages across the three-week Grand Tour, including the cancellation of the final stage in Madrid, when protestors blocked the course with barriers and some riders were pushed from their bikes.

On stage five during the team time trial, a banner was unfurled in front of Israel-Premier Tech as they approached at speed, taking four of eight riders out of the stage.

Alongside the withdrawal of Premier Tech, the old team's bike supplier Factor also decided to end its association.

The team were expected to take up one of world governing body the UCI's World Tour berths for 2026, having spent three seasons as a second-tier ProTeam following their relegation for the World Tour after failing to amass enough points.

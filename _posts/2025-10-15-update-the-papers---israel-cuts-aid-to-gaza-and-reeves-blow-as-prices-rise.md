It has been recently reported that Daily Mail's assessment of the latest figures on the economy, which showed the number of jobless hitting a four-year high, as the International Monetary Fund predicted the UK would have the highest inflation in the G7. The Daily Express says the figures are fresh humiliation for the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The i Paper says the triple lock will help to buffer older people from inflation, with the state pension set to climb by 4.8%.

The Daily Telegraph says Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will tell a summit of Balkan interior ministers in London that the UK has lost control of its borders - and that this failure is eroding trust in political leaders and the credibility of the state. The Times reports on a different concern of the Home Secretary. It says she took a "dim view" of a warning from the Council of Europe that the government's policies on trans rights and banning Palestine Action could breach the European Convention on Human Rights. A source tells the paper that the intervention plays into the hands of Reform UK and the Conservatives, which both want to leave the Convention.

The Guardian says the fragile ceasefire in Gaza has faced its first test - with Israel halving the aid allowed into the territory, accusing Hamas of withholding the bodies of its hostages. The Times says Hamas has been killing its enemies on the streets of Gaza, as it attempts to regain control. The Telegraph says for Hamas, "peace" has started with mass executions.

The Daily Mirror considers evidence from the former Education Secretary Sir Gavin Williamson to the Covid Inquiry. "At last they admit it," it says - "Boris DID harm our kids." The Daily Star says Sir Gavin admitted that the plan to shut schools was decided in just 24 hours.

The Times says a new book claims that Lady Margaret Thatcher had two extramarital affairs. It says the book - The Incidental Feminist - says the former prime minister had a relationship with the PR executive Tim Bell - and the Conservative MP Sir Humphrey Atkins. The Express quotes an unnamed politician as saying: "The joke about Atkins was that for someone who was not very good, he kept getting promoted. Now why was that?"

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England women are eighth in the International Hockey Federation rankings, while the men's side are seventh 

England men's and women's hockey teams both failed to reach the semi-finals of the 2025 EuroHockey Championships after disappointing defeats in Germany. 

The women's side were beaten 2-1 by Spain in Pool B, while the men's team suffered a shock 3-2 loss to France in Pool C. 

It was Spain's first victory over England in normal time of the women's Euros for 30 years, and secured qualification for the Hockey World Cup in 2026. 

France have reached their first men's Euros semi-final since 1970 thanks to a last-gasp winner against England. 

England men face Belgium in their final group match on Thursday, with the women's team playing France on Friday, both at 14:00 BST. 

Spain opened the scoring against England through Luciana Molino in the first quarter, before Tessa Howard equalised with a field goal two minutes later. 

Lucia Jimenez scored the decisive goal for Spain in the second half, sending them through to the semi-finals at the expense of England, who had beaten Scotland 3-0 in their opening game. 

England's men, meanwhile, who defeated Poland 5-0 in their opening game, followed by a 1-1 draw with Germany, took the lead on 10 minutes against France through Stuart Rushmore, before an Amaury Bellenger equaliser in the third quarter. 

Matteo Desgouillons' strike to put France ahead was cancelled about by Rushmore's second late on, but with the final buzzer approaching, England were left stunned when Timothee Clement scored to send France through to the semis.

According to new developments, Dan Ballard and Brodie Spencer will miss the away World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Germany through injury

Northern Ireland defenders Daniel Ballard and Brodie Spencer have been ruled out of the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers away to Luxembourg and Germany.

Sunderland's Ballard was forced off in the first half of his side's 2-0 loss against Burnley on Saturday, while Spencer was injured in Oxford United's 6-0 Carabao Cup defeat against Brighton on Wednesday.

It is a further blow for boss Michael O'Neill, who is already without goalkeepers Pierce Charles and Conor Hazard as well as defender Ciaron Brown and midfielder Jordan Thompson through injury.

O'Neill has called up uncapped trio Kofi Balmer, Ryan Johnson and Jamie McDonnell as replacements and further cover.

Motherwell defender Balmer, 24, has made 20 appearances for Northern Ireland's Under-21 side and been called up to the senior squad on six occasions without making an appearance.

Johnson, a 28-year-old centre-back at League One AFC Wimbledon, receives his first senior call after featuring for Northern Ireland at under-21 level.

Midfielder McDonnell is currently on loan at League One side Mansfield Town from Premier League side Nottingham Forest, who took the 21-year-old from Irish Premiership side Glentoran in 2020.

He has represented his country at under-17 and under-21 level.

Northern Ireland begin their World Cup qualifying campaign in Luxembourg on Thursday, 4 September.

They travel to Cologne to take on Germany in their second Group A game on Sunday, 7 September.

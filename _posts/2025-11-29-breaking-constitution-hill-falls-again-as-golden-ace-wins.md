It has been recently reported that Constitution Hill won his first 10 races

Former champion hurdler Constitution Hill fell once again as Golden Ace came through to win the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle.

Constitution Hill won his first 10 races but has now fallen three times in four outings.

Newcastle's largest attendance for jump racing in 20 years was shocked after barely a minute as the horse came down at the second hurdle, before previously unbeaten The New Lion also fell when in the lead.

Anzadam - also previously unbeaten - was second, with Nemean Lion the third and final finisher.

"Constitution Hill did the same thing as he has twice before, stood off a mile and hit the middle of the hurdle," former champion jockey AP McCoy told ITV Sport.

The previously unbeaten 2023 Champion Hurdle hero also had heavy falls at Cheltenham and Aintree.

Golden Ace trainer Jeremy Scott said: "I'm glad everyone is up OK, who could believe Constitution Hill coming down again?"

"We must be everybody's nemesis! Her jumping was very good today and we've beaten Anzadam whatever. I still don't think we're quite there, so there's hopefully more to come."

The Coral Gold Cup Handicap Chase was won by Panic Attack, from Three Card Brag and The Changing Man.

Let's dive into the details: Lee Carsley leads England Under-21s into the Euro 2025 final against Germany on Saturday

Lee Carsley has had little time to reflect on his whirlwind two years.

The eve of his second European Under-21 Championship final, as England look to defend their title against Germany in Bratislava on Saturday, is unlikely to be the time either. 

Carsley's six-game spell in charge of the senior side last year thrust him into the spotlight, one which he was not used to, and a return to the Under-21s has done little to keep him under the radar after guiding them to the brink of another trophy. 

Two years ago it was new territory as England won the Under-21 Euros for the first time in 39 years but, such has been the nature of his journey, Carsley says he is yet to take in his achievements. 

"I was actually thinking about this the other day and how fast things have moved," he said. 

"I definitely need a bit of reflection time but it's been so exciting. I wouldn't have changed it. It was such a privilege to do." 

Carsley says he learned a lot from coaching the senior team.

"You always wonder whether you're capable of managing at that level, coaching at that level and that's fine," the 51-year-old said.

"It was something I enjoyed, something I didn't feel drowned by. I was excited by the games."

A second European Under-21 title would match Dave Sexton's achievements of 1982 and 1984 but Carsley had already justified the Football Association's faith by delivering the trophy two years ago. 

There was a strong sense he could replace Sir Gareth Southgate as senior manager, especially after two opening wins against Ireland and Finland at the start of his interim spell last summer. 

He won five and lost one - a defeat to Greece which clearly still rankles - with Thomas Tuchel appointed last October, leaving Carsley to take charge of his final two games - Nations League victories against Greece and Ireland. 

Carlsley ultimately signed a new two-year deal with the Under-21s this month, one which will take him through to Euro 2027 in Albania and Serbia. A title defence would strengthen his case to be the man to succeed Tuchel. 

The German is due to be in Bratislava for Saturday's game and is dashing from the Club World Cup in America to watch the Young Lions and Carsley try to keep their composure against a Germany side they lost to last week. 

Yet Carsley remained one of the coolest men in a sweltering stadium during Wednesday's semi-final win against the Netherlands - despite his choice of a long-sleeve hooded top. 

He spent spells of the second half crouching, he was far from passive but there was no loss of temper, angst or nerves visible.

He privately joked about keeping his temperament under wraps after the game, conceding he had felt the pressure, although stated publicly it was important to not let it show. 

"If you watch us training I'm probably not as calm but it's very difficult to coach on a matchday. We have to trust the players they can adopt the gameplan we've spoken about," said the 51-year-old.

"In terms of the way I want the team to play, if you saw me on the side ranting and raving I can't expect the players to be exciting, express themselves and play with freedom."

Carsley has grown into the role. When he first succeeded Aidy Boothroyd in 2021 being a front facing member of the England set-up did not necessarily come naturally, even in small meetings with a limited number of reporters at St George's Park. 

A couple of slips during his time with the seniors - he was criticised for not singing the national anthem despite explaining it was something he did not do while playing for Ireland - and the surprising admission he would "hopefully" return to the Under-21s before Tuchel's appointment was announced, created more headlines than he intended.

Since then, though, he has relaxed, with side jokes about journalists' clothes in the hot Slovakian sun or nods in news conferences about topics he knew would come up from certain writers. 

His other senior management experience came from caretaker spells at Coventry, Brentford and Birmingham but he is at ease in Slovakia and it shows. 

He has respect from his peers too with Germany boss Antonio di Salvo, a former Bayern Munich forward, recognising the job Carsley has done. 

"I talk to Lee every so often, we are good colleagues and have seen each other at a number of Uefa meetings," he said. 

"After winning the title two years ago, he was also with the senior team and you can see their team is united and we can see his signature on it. He's doing a really good job."

Alex Scott spoke in glowing terms about England Under-21 boss Lee Carsley 

Carsley does not pretend to be someone he is not either. He is genuine and honest, with excellent man management skills, traits similar to Southgate who he worked so closely with, having joined his staff for Euro 2024. 

He brings the balls out for the warm-ups, not a usual responsibility the head coach, but a small statement of his ways. 

Noticeably, the players often use his nickname 'Cars' when talking about the head coach. Not 'the manager' or the 'gaffer' in a sign of his close relationship with them, which has allowed them to develop and shine in the knockout stages in Slovakia. 

"He's created a group but it's not just Lee. It's the whole whole staff group - it runs from the physios to the assistants, starts with Lee, runs all the way down," said defender Charlie Cresswell. 

"It feeds off to us players. We've got such a good group in there, the togetherness that we have as a squad it's inspirational."

Captain James McAtee has spoken about Carsley's "belief and trust" while Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott, who scored in the group stage defeat to Germany agreed. 

Scott gives credit to Carsley's methods as a man and manager to perfectly encapsulate his personality. 

"It's something that started with Gareth and what he brought into the England set-up, and Lee has done the same thing. The relationship we have as a team and the things we do off the pitch ultimately come together on it.

"Cars is massive for the group and makes everyone feel welcome and wanted as players. To have that relationship with your coach on and off the pitch is so important if we want to be successful.

"Winning the tournament two years ago and taking the seniors for those games, Cars has shown how good a man and coach he is."

It will still matter regardless of the outcome in Slovakia but winning would create Carsley's legacy and the former Coventry and Everton midfielder is eyeing a dynasty. 

"Our record at this tournament, it's fair to say, isn't great. From not qualifying for the tournament or getting knocked out in the group stages," he said.

"Obviously Dave Sexton started off great and you'd like to see a period of domination but we didn't do that. 

"Spain have done it, Italy have done it, Germany have done it, the Netherlands have done it. We have to make sure we're there."

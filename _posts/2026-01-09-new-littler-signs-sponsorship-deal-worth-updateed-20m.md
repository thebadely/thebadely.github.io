Here’s what you need to know: Luke Littler beat Gian van Veen 7-1 to win the World Darts Championship

World number one Luke Littler has signed a record sponsorship deal for a darts player worth a reported Â£20m.

The 18-year-old, who claimed the Â£1m prize for winning the World Championship earlier this month, has signed a 10-year agreement with Target Darts.

Target has described the deal as "the largest agreement in darts history between a brand and a player" and PA Media reports that it is worth up to Â£20m with potential bonuses and add-ons.

BBC Sport has contacted Littler's representatives and Target Darts for comment.

Littler has won two world titles and already has 10 major titles to his name.

"Target has believed in me from day one," said Littler, who is also managed by the company.

"From my playing career to my product range, we've built everything together and I'm really excited to commit to our partnership long-term and see where we can take this next."

Target sells a range of equipment including Luke Littler darts, dartboards and playing shirts.

'I want to dominate' - Littler takes another step towards greatness

Littler headlines Premier League line-up

Littler burst on to the scene at the 2024 World Championship, reaching the final but coming up short against Luke Humphries.

He won the Premier League title in 2024 and went on to lift his first world title in January 2025 before retaining his crown.

Only Phil Taylor, with 14, and Michael van Gerwen, on three, have won more PDC world titles than Littler, who is also just the fourth player to triumph in successive years.

Target chairman Garry Plummer said: "I met Luke at the BDO Youth World Championship Qualifier when he was 12, and that day his dad asked if we would sponsor him.

"We'd never taken on someone so young, but I saw something special in him and saying yes was easy."

Littler is currently preparing for the World Series double-header in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

Luke Littler's impact on darts is hard to overstate.

His run to the PDC World Championship final two years ago as a 16-year-old captured the imagination and helped create a new generation of darts fans.

This latest deal shows that initial enthusiasm over Littler has remained, and even grown, as the teenager has gone on to dominate the sport.

The prize money for the winner at the World Championship doubled to Â£1m this year and next the tournament will move from the West Hall to the larger Great Hall at Alexandra Palace, allowing an extra 70,000 spectators to attend across the competition.

There can be little doubt that the emergence of Littler has played a part in both.

He is no longer just a darts phenomenon but a sports star in the broader sense â and with this sponsorship deal, he is now getting paid as such.

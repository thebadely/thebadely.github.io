Experts revealed that Palace have qualified for the Europa League by winning last season's FA Cup

Crystal Palace shareholder John Textor has received an offer to sell his stake in the club - which could clear the way for the Eagles to compete in the Europa League next season.

Woody Johnson, the owner of NFL franchise the New York Jets, wants to buy Textor's stake in Palace, according to BBC Sport sources.

Crystal Palace have tried to convince Uefa that they should be allowed to participate in the competition, with a decision expected to come towards the end of the month.

Uefa rules forbid individuals from having control of more than one club in the same competition to avoid conflicts of interest.

Eagle Football - the multi-club group owned by Textor which includes a minority shareholding in Palace - has a majority stake in French side Lyon, who have also qualified for next season's competition.

Palace are arguing that Textor - who has repeatedly tried to sell his stake with the club - does not have decisive control. Eagle Football holds a 43% stake in Palace.

Palace executives travelled to Switzerland last week for a meeting with Uefa to put their case forward.

If Textor does sell his Eagle Football shares, then that could clear the path for Palace to participate.

Johnson, 78, who has been to Selhurst Park last season, was a supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

There were reports last year that he could step back from his role as chairman of the Jets to serve as an ambassador for President Trump, something he did during the Republican leader's first term when Johnson served as ambassador to the United Kingdom.

The New York Jets and Crystal Palace have been approached for comment.

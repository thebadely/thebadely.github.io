According to new developments, Pascal Siakam was named MVP of the Eastern Conference finals after another starring role for the Indiana Pacers

The Indiana Pacers reached the NBA Finals for the first time since 2000 as they beat the New York Knicks 125-108 in game six of the Eastern Conference finals.

Pascal Siakam maintained his impressive form to be named MVP of the series after recording 31 points and three blocked shots on Saturday in Indianapolis.

Siakam scored over 30 points in three of four victories for the Pacers, who won the series 4-2.

The Pacers will face Western Conference winners the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, which begin on Thursday.

Siakam, a nine-year veteran who won the title in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors, said: "After a bad game five, we wanted to bounce back and I have 100% belief in my team-mates. Whenever we're down, we find a way, and we did that tonight."

Looking back to when he was an NBA champion, Siakam said: "That year was my third year, I was this young kid. I thought it was going to be easy [to get back].

"I appreciate it even more now because I know how hard it is to get here."

Speaking about Siakam, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle added: "So deserving. The guy has been a rock of consistency all year."

Tyrese Haliburton also starred for the hosts, adding 21 points, 13 assists and three steals, while Obi Toppin scored 18 points off the bench.

"It's a special feeling to do it with this group," Haliburton said. "We got to the same spot last year and we fell short. We worked our tails off to get back here."

For the Knicks, OG Anunoby top-scored with 24 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points as the visitors fell short after conceding 18 turnovers.

The first quarter was a tight affair as the Pacers led 25-24 before stretching their lead to four points by the end of the first half.

Pacers took control in the third quarter, which began with a 9-0 run, to end the Knicks' resistance and claim the series win.

Let's dive into the details: Catcher Will Smith has been one of the Dodgers' best hitters in this World Series, driving in a run to get them on the board in the third inning before reaching home himself on a Mookie Betts single

The Los Angeles Dodgers bounced back to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-1 and set up a deciding seventh game in the World Series after tying the series at 3-3.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts shuffled his batting order after back-to-back home defeats, and it took them until the third inning at Toronto's Rogers Centre just to get a man on base, when Will Smith and Mookie Betts drove in runs to put them 3-0 ahead.

George Springer's sharp line drive reduced the deficit, but Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto kept the hosts in check, giving up just that one run in six innings pitched.

Neither side was able to score a run after the third inning, and both sides stranded multiple baserunners as the Dodgers held on for victory.

Dodgers centre fielder Justin Dean raised both arms as soon as the ball wedged under the outfield wall, and the "ground rule double" call was upheld on video review

The Blue Jays will feel aggrieved after a controversial umpiring call prevented them from levelling the score in the bottom of the ninth inning.

Toronto's Alejandro Kirk was hit by a pitch from reliever Roki Sasaki and replaced by speedy pinch-runner Myles Straw, before Addison Barger's line drive wedged under the wall in left centre field.

But instead of allowing Straw and Barger to score, the play was ruled to be a ground rule double,, external putting the runners on second and third.

A ground rule double is typically signalled when a ball hit fair is deemed to be impossible to field in the layout of a particular stadium, such as when it becomes trapped under a tarpaulin, and runners are allowed to advance by two bases.

The hosts challenged the call, arguing that a fielder could easily have retrieved the ball, but the on-field decision was upheld by video review.

And with the tying run in scoring position, Andres Gimenez drove into a double play to end the game.

Earlier, the Dodgers drew first blood on Halloween night as Tommy Edman doubled, Shohei Ohtani was intentionally walked, and Smith's double to left field sent Edman home.

Freddie Freeman drew a walk to load the bases, and Betts' two-run single gave the visitors what proved to be a decisive lead to force a decider.

Game seven takes place on Saturday evening, again at the Rogers Centre.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto came out of the game after six innings, having given up five hits but restricting the Blue Jays to one run

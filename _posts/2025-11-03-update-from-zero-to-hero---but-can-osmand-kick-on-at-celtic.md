According to new developments, Callum Osmand did not feature at all under the man who signed him - Brendan Rodgers

Callum Osmand's all-action goalscoring display off the bench in Celtic's Scottish League Cup semi-final success over Rangers prompted a similar thought in the minds of many.

"Where has Osmand been?" asked former Celtic defender Charlie Mulgrew. 

"Why has he not been an option until now?" wondered ex-Scotland forward James McFadden.

Those questions would likely also have been asked by a fanbase that has watched its team struggle in attack throughout this season.

In an influential cameo at Hampden, the 19-year-old scored one and could have had a couple more as Celtic saw off their 10-man rivals in extra time.

Replacing fellow goalscorer Johnny Kenny, who seems to have grasped his opportunity with both hands, Osmand has now also staked a claim to be a regular under interim manager Martin O'Neill.

"There are no words, it's one of those moments that don't happen," the teenage forward told Premier Sports. "It's an amazing feeling, there's nothing better.

"This is going to be the craziest day of my life, there is nothing that can really top this - unless its scoring against them in the final - but it's the best day of my life."

'I don't even know when it is' - but will O'Neill be Celtic manager for final?

So where has Osmand been?

"Running up and down in the rain on the pitch on my own," according to the Wales youth international, who was signed from Fulham's academy on a free transfer in the summer.

A free-scoring forward in the Premier League side's youth set-up, former manager Brendan Rodgers highlighted Osmand's potential when he arrived in June.

However, the teenager failed to play a single minute under Rodgers, despite his attack lacking cutting edge, pace and intensity in the months before his shock resignation, and he was not included in Celtic's Europa League squad.

Osmand was then handed his debut by O'Neill as a substitute in last Wednesday's 4-0 win over Falkirk and again came off the bench at Hampden on Sunday.

"He has just given me the confidence and the trust," Osmand said of the Celtic caretaker boss. "It only takes one person to believe in you and push you on.

"The past few months, that's the bit that builds you as a person and a player. Those moments where I've not been in squads and I'm running up and down in the rain on the pitch on my own - with a couple other boys - is painful.

"But I feel those are the bits that create you as a player and prepare you for these moments - you just have to take it."

O'Neill conceded he "didn't know anything" about Osmand until a week ago, but he has hailed his "excellent" contribution since.

"The young man is very sharp," the interim manager added. "He wants to get a couple of DVDs on Henrik [Larsson] - that would help.

"He's got plenty of confidence, he was arguing with everyone at the end."

Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon described Osmand as "something a little bit different".

In a vibrant and influential showing at Hampden, the Welshman had five shots and picked up a yellow card for a foul on Rangers captain James Tavernier.

His goal came with his fifth effort, a first-time finish between the posts following a low cross from the left by Kieran Tierney.

In the build-up, the youngster's intense pressing helped Celtic regain the ball in the final third when he dispossessed Joe Rothwell.

That kind of drive has been missing from a Celtic side that have failed to score in six games this term and have netted fewer league goals than Heart of Midlothian, Hibernian and Dundee United.

But with seven goals in their past two games under O'Neill, and young duo Osmand and Kenny emerging from the shadows, there are suddenly signs of life in the forward line.

"That summed up a Celtic team under Martin O'Neill," former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said on BBC Sportsound.

"High energy, everybody banging into tackles. Is that what we are going to get from Celtic every week now?".

David: Kenny suddenly starts banging them in. Osmand gets in the squad and scores - neither of these were happening under Rodgers. The shackles are off and players seem liberated.

Ian: Good to see the intensity back. Osmand and Kenny look good options up front, and Auston Trusty was solid.

Jim: Why has it taken until now for Osmand to get included in the first team? Rodgers wanted to send him out on loan. It's early days, but youth is finally getting a chance for stardom.

Gary: Celtic would be in the Champions League if Osmand had been selected from the first game of the season. O'Neill and Shaun Maloney have re-introduced attacking football and should be permanent appointments. The dismal and disastrous Rodgers regime is over.

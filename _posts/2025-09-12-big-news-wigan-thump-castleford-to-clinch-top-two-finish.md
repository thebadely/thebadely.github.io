Let's dive into the details: Wigan Warriors are the defending Super League champions

Wigan Warriors clinched a top-two finish in Super League and a home semi-final after romping to a 11-try win against lowly Castleford Tigers.

While the victory keeps Wigan's slim hopes of finishing top of the table alive with just one regular-season game remaining, frontrunners Hull KR will win the League Leaders' Shield on Saturday if they avoid defeat by Wakefield Trinity.

Two tries each from Jack Farrimond and Liam Marshall, after Abbas Miski and Jai Field grabbed early scores, put Wigan 34-0 up at the break.

A second score from Miski and a try from Harvie Hill followed, only for Muizz Mustapha to then dart in for a Tigers consolation try.

But Zach Eckersley, Field and Ethan Havard went over late on to complete the thumping win that ensures Wigan will get a week off when the play-offs start later this month.

Sam Walters very nearly gave Wigan the perfect start, but fumbled the ball in a tackle as he looked to crash over the line inside two minutes.

A handling error from Castleford, as they tried to run the ball out of their own half, meant the early let-off was only a short reprieve, with Bevan French setting Miski up for the game's first try with a teasing grubber kick that squirmed from the grasp of Tigers full-back Tex Hoy.

Miski then turned provider, intercepting a pass before sending Super League's leading try-scorer Field over for his 23rd of the season.

Two Marshall tries in five minutes, including a spectacular diving finish which left him with a bloodied scalp after skidding off the turf, had Wigan well on their way to a convincing victory.

Farrimond followed up with back-to-back tries of his own, the first he created for himself with a clever kick before later linking up with Field to run in Wigan's sixth first-half try.

And with Farrimond converting both of his tries, the 19-year-old - who was brought in to replace England half-back Harry Smith - finished the half with a personal points tally of 18.

Miski then leapt over for his second try of the night eight minutes into the second half after Eckersley juggled a Farrimond kick and offloaded for the winger to finish.

A disastrous attempt of a goal-line drop out for Hoy, which comically went backwards as it sailed and landed back in goal on the left edge, gifted Wigan possession and chance to add to their lead, which Hill eventually did after a succession of repeat sets.

Mustapha managed to conjure a spectacular solo try in response, only for Eckersley, Field and Havard to dot down and take Wigan past the 60-point mark.

Wigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I enjoy seeing us learn and build through the year, and some of the tough days are still enjoyable.

"The big thing that is enjoyable tonight is that we performed well and we came through healthy, so roll on next week."

On teenager Farrimond: "He showed tonight that he can perform at a Super League standard and he is going to get more opportunities to do that and put pressure on Harry [Smith], Bevan [French] and Jai [Field] and that is brilliant for the club. 

"I'm really proud of him and really loved how he applied himself at the start of the game when they targeted him and he whacked a few - that is what he builds his game off."

Castleford Tigers interim head coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds:

"We got taught a real lesson in how to be physical, how to control a game, how to complete and how to compete.

"I don't know what to say to these guys anymore, I'll be honest. You can almost flip a coin and it's heads or tails what turns up on a game day.

"I'm just disappointed that we show signs, we have 10-minute periods here and there, and it's just not good enough at this level. There are too many errors from the same individuals week in, week out.

"Unfortunately for us we just don't have the depth or any players to come in, so we have to keep playing those individuals."

Experts revealed that Three men were brought to safety following a cave rescue lasting more than 30 hours in "appalling conditions" during Storm Amy.

The experienced cavers were stranded in the challenging Dowber Gill Passage, near Grassington, North Yorkshire.

The alarm was raised at 22:00 BST on Thursday when they failed to return and one of their wives called the police.

Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association said more than 100 volunteers took part in the "long and difficult" rescue, which was hampered by worsening weather, flooding, rough terrain and long hours underground.

By the time the men were found in the early hours of Friday, rising water levels  meant the simplest way out was impassable, forcing the rescuers and the cavers to retrace their steps.

Rescue team leader Derek Hammond described how if they had reached the men just an hour or two earlier, they all could have been home "in time for breakfast".

"Unfortunately the weather had a different plan for us," he said.

"The immediate danger is the water and, potentially in certain parts of the cave, drowning.

"Had the water level risen in those places, it would have been exceedingly dangerous."

Neighbouring caving teams were called for assistance, including Calder Valley Search & Rescue Team, Derbyshire Cave Rescue Organisation, Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service and Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team.

The underground teams worked in relays to guide the exhausted cavers back, while surface crews endured "appalling" weather to maintain communication and manage logistics.

At one point, team members constructed a dam using plastic sheeting to carry rising flood water past the cave entrance. Traverse lines were installed to help people avoid having to wade through water.

The first missing caver was brought to safety at 15:30 BST on Friday, the second at 02:30 on Saturday and the third two hours later.

None of them were injured but Mr Hammond said they were exhausted after being cold and wet for 42 hours.

"It takes a strong man to survive that," he said.

The team finally stood down at 07:45.

While Storm Amy had been forecast to take effect from Friday afternoon, Mr Hammond said the expedition planned by the men had been "perfectly reasonable" given their experience and the weather conditions on Thursday.

However, heavy rain arrived earlier and more intensely than expected.

The men had shared key details of their route – from Providence Pot to Dow Cave – before setting off, and Mr Hammond said this "saved the day". 

"Without that phone call from the wife, nobody would have known these guys were overdue until somebody saw the cars parked outside the cave for a couple of days," he added.

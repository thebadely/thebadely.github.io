Hereâ€™s what you need to know: (left to right) Caroline Weir, Dundee United's Max Watters, Martin Boyle of Hibernian and Napoli's Scott McTominay

Scottish football fans could be forgiven for glancing out the window to make sure the sky is still blue. Well, grey.

Out of a men's Euros last year with a whimper, not even at this year's women's event, and a club game with a co-efficient dropping through the floor. 

Yeah, Scottish football has drama, but sometimes, it is not very easy.

But, Thursday 7 August, 2025 is the day it all changed. 

It's the day Our Wee Bit Hill and Glen was rewarded with two Ballon d'Or nominees - one man, one woman - then followed it up with a pair of non-Old Firm sides going away in Europe and delivering two heroic results. 

Martin Boyle first joined Hibs in 2015

It's never a good sign when a team's supporters are called The Gravediggers. 

Hibernian traversed Europe to face Partizan Belgrade, still carrying the baggage of heartache from the previous week. 

In Europa League qualifying, they took Midtjylland to extra-time, only to lose with an agonising - and spectacular - Junior Brumado bicycle kick. Glorious failure etc. 

But not this time. Now in Conference League qualifying, the Edinburgh club blew away their hosts - who were on a five-game winning streak - finishing the game 2-0 and a man to the good.

The hero of the hour? Martin Boyle. The Scottish-born Australian international took his Hibs goal tally to 101. 

The Gravediggers were buried. It'll take some effort for them to overhaul the tie in Edinburgh next week.

"To come here and win 2-0 is unbelievable, it took some effort," said Easter Road boss David Gray.

"We asked the players to come over here, give everything and to make sure the tie is still alive when you go home, we've certainly done that.

"We've put ourselves in a fantastic position but I've just reminded the players that's all it is at the moment in time."

Highlights: Rapid Vienna 2-2 Dundee United

While Hibs were cruising in Belgrade, around 400 miles north in Vienna, Dundee United displayed character and dig to stun Rapid in a 2-2 draw.

Also a third-round qualifier in the Conference League, Jim Goodwin's side twice came from behind inside a bouncing Allianz Stadion against one of last season's quarter-finalists. 

First it was Max Watters who brought them level, before Zac Sapsford repeated the feat in the second half.

But the goals are only half the story. United faced 21 shots while having just 38% of the ball. Brave defending, acrobatic goalkeeping from Yevhenii Kucherenko, and a bit of luck all played their part. 

History plays its part in emphasising how significant this result could be. 

Last week, United progressed in Europe for the first time in 28 years by seeing off UNA Strassen of Luxembourg. 

It hints at how hard life can be on the continent. The last time United played in Europe prior to this season they lost 7-0 to AZ, albeit after winning the first leg.

But they've given themselves a chance here. In a second-half of constant pressure, they didn't buckle, and an already sold-out Tannadice awaits next Thursday.

"Outstanding away performance from Dundee United to a man," said former United midfielder Scott Allan.

"Jim Goodwin will be absolutely delighted. Take this game back to Tannadice and it's all to play for."

How McTominay became a Ballon d'Or nominee

Scotland's Galactica & Ballon d'Or nominee walks in footsteps of Zidane 

Before a ball was kicked on Thursday, Scotland had already scored two huge accolades.

It emerged Napoli and Scotland midfielder Scott McTominay had been nominated for the Ballon d'Or. At the same time, it was also announced Real Madrid's Caroline Weir had been shortlisted, too.

It is the first time both a man and a woman from Scotland have made their respective lists, and the most Scots nominated in the one year since 1984 (Graeme Souness, Paul McStay and Gordon Strachan).

Neither will come as a huge surprise. 

McTominay - Manchester United fans, look away now - has been the totem for the locals in Naples who sang his name in the streets as their team claimed the Serie A title. He also was awarded the Serie A player of the year award.

In Spain, Weir is now going into her fourth season at Real Madrid, where she is the club's all-time leading female goalscorer. 

Ten came last season in the league for Las Blancas as they finished second in Liga F, along with eight assists. Seventeen strikes were netted in all competitions.

Denis Law is the only Scot to have won the prestigious award, having been nominated seven times

It came a day earlier, but an honourable mention has to also go to Rangers who convincingly beat Viktoria Plzen 3-0 at Ibrox to take a giant stride towards the Champions League play-off round.

Russell Martin's side were far from convincing in the second qualifying round, but they still found a way beyond Panathinaikos across two legs. 

All of these results are much needed for Scotland's ailing co-efficient. 

This season Celtic face a play-off round to get into the Champions League rather than direct entry, and the country needs as many teams as possible to make into their respective league phases.

There is a train of thought that Scottish football, for all its drama, intrigue and excitement, wasn't always the best quality. 

However, the vast majority of clubs in the top flight are spending money, attendances are up, and there is a feel-good factor back. 

Let's hope Thursday 7 August, 2025 isn't the outlier, but a signal of good times to come.

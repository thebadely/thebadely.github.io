It has been recently reported that Moses Itauma made his pro debut aged 18 in 2023

Moses Itauma's promoter Frank Warren says his heavyweight is happy to fight Kubrat Pulev next after the match-up was ordered by the WBA.

Pulev, the WBA's 'Regular' champion, was ordered to defend his belt against the 20-year-old rising star.

Team Itauma has been considering a fight for the Englishman in December, with Derek Chisora suggesting he would share a card with Itauma on 13 December in Manchester.

"We've had several top heavyweights already turn down a fight with Moses but if Pulev fancies the job now that it's been ordered we will absolutely be pursuing it. It's a brilliant fight," Warren told BBC Sport.

Itauma last fought in August when he blew former world title challenger Dillian Whyte away in one round.

The result improved Itauma's undefeated record to 13 fights and eleven knockouts.

Itauma has since been linked with a slew of potential opponents including Filip Hrgovic, Michael Hunter and domestic rival David Adeleye.

Warren is keen to give Itauma more rounds as the youngster only has 26 rounds under his belt so far.

Pulev is a veteran of the sport at the age of 44, with 35 fights on his record.

The Bulgarian has twice challenged for world titles, losing to Anthony Joshua in 2020 and Wladimir Klitschko in 2014.

Queensberry boss Warren has cooled talk of an imminent fight with the likes of Oleksandr Usyk, but says Itauma "is already one of the best heavyweights in world boxing".

"Our job is to make the right fights for him at the right time," Warren said.

"I've been in boxing 47 years and at his age, 20 years of age, he is the best young talent at that age that I've ever been involved with, and I've been involved with 99% of the top British fighters and other fighters from around the world."

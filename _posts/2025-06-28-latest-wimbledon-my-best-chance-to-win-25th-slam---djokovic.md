It has been recently reported that Novak Djokovic practised with Carlos Alcaraz, who has beaten the Serb in the past two Wimbledon finals, on Centre Court this week

Novak Djokovic believes Wimbledon gives him the best chance of disrupting the dominance of his younger rivals and finally landing an outright record 25th Grand Slam title.

Djokovic has not won any of the tennis majors since triumphing at the US Open in September 2023, with Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz splitting the six Grand Slam titles in that time.

The 38-year-old Serb is bidding for what would also be a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon men's title, moving him level with his long-time rival Roger Federer.

Djokovic, who plays France's Alexandre Muller in the first round, has lost each of the past two Wimbledon finals to Alcaraz.

Asked about claiming the 25th major that would take him clear of Australia's Margaret Court, he said: "I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance.

"That's because of the results I have had, because of how I feel and how I play in Wimbledon.

"I get an extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level."

Was that Djokovic's goodbye to the French Open?

Italy's Sinner, 23, and Spain's Alcaraz, 22, have emerged as the dominant pair on the ATP Tour in what has been a changing of the guard over the past two seasons.

Djokovic's 2025 season has been patchy by his lofty standards, but he continues to be a threat at the business end of the Grand Slams.

He has continued to defy age - and logic - by producing some extraordinary performances, particularly when he beat Alcaraz in a memorable Australian Open quarter-final in January.

At last month's French Open, he lost to Sinner in straight sets in their semi-final, but the way he pushed the world number one throughout showed how much he still offers at the top of the game.

Djokovic, who is seeded sixth at the All England Club, says chasing the younger rivals has not changed his mentality.

"In a sense you're always hunting because you're always going for the titles - in my also privileged position - the records and more history," said Djokovic.

"I do feel that I'm always in that position of going for something with the attitude of trying to win rather than trying to defend.

"It is slightly different for me now in terms of I don't chase the rankings any more.

"I'm trying to play the best tennis in Grand Slams and trying to win Grand Slams. That hasn't changed. It still stays the same."

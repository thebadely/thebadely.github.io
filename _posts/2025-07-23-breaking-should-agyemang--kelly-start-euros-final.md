Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Michelle Agyemang and Chloe Kelly have been involved in goals in both of England's knockout games

Not for the first time, Michelle Agyemang and Chloe Kelly proved to be England's saviours.

The Lionesses looked to be heading out of Euro 2025 as they trailed Italy 1-0 with one minute remaining of added time in Tuesday's semi-final.

But then the narrative was altered dramatically, as 19-year-old Agyemang scored in the 96th minute to take the game to extra time before Kelly drove home the rebound from her saved penalty to seal victory. 

It was another impressive comeback that was masterminded by the same players who helped rescue England's hopes in their quarter-final against Sweden.

But as Sarina Wiegman begins to ponder how she will set up her side for Sunday's final against either Germany or Spain, should the attacking duo be promoted to the starting line-up? Or is it risky to change what has become a successful formula?

There is a sense of deja vu about the role Kelly and Agyemang are playing.

At Euro 2022, regular substitutes Alessia Russo and Ella Toone featured in six games from the bench. 

Toone scored twice - including in the final - while Russo netted four goals, the most of any substitute at a women's European Championship.

Wiegman has made a point of highlighting her "finishers" - the players she brings on at the end of a game. For the England manager, they are as important a part of the equation as those who start.

Former England striker Rachel Daly said Wiegman has "got it right so far" with her team selection.

"It's working. Don't fix what isn't broken," she said on the Daly Brightness podcast., external

"People will call out 'start them' but there is so much to be said for people who can come on and make a difference. It's really difficult to do."

Agyemang's statistics at Euro 2025 are impressive. 

She averages 6.1 shots per 90 minutes, compared with Russo's 2.9 - although the magnitude of the difference is partly explained by England chasing games against tiring opposition when the young forward has come on.

Her 15.17 touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes are also the most of any England player.

Daly's thoughts have been echoed by former Lionesses goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain, who said Wiegman "loves to stick with what she knows".

"I don't think Sarina Wiegman's going to change her team at all. If those 11 players are fit then those 11 players will start the final," she said on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast.

"England play the game for their substitutes - Alessia Russo and Ella Toone were the ones in the last Euros. This year she's got the same. 

"She's got her trusted 11. There have been a couple of tweaks but not much, and she knows she has talent to come off the bench and change the game when she needs it."

There is an opposing view, though - one that is partly fuelled by how much football the regular starting line-up have played.

Former England midfielder Karen Carney highlighted the fact the Lionesses have had back-to-back games that have gone to extra time.

With just one change between the Sweden and Italy knockout games - Esme Morgan replacing Jess Carter - bringing in Agyemang and Kelly for the final would add fresh legs to a squad that could be fatigued.

Kelly, Agyemang, Aggie Beever-Jones and Beth Mead make up four of the five substitutes who have been involved in the most goals at Euro 2025.

"I do think now with how many minutes the starting XI have continually played, I think that freshness is the most important thing," Carney said on ITV.

"Germany are powerhouses, Spain are the technical team - I do think she has to look at the squad and rip that script up. I do think we need fresh legs to start.

"Plan A is isn't working, Plan B is magnificent. I want to make Plan A work more so I think with her changes in the starting XI, we have to have fresh energy in that team."

Annabel: Agyemang and Kelly are injections of energy rather than lasting all game and Michelle is still only a teenager. I think they will be more hyped in the second half to be subbed on - maybe a bit earlier than last game! Greenwood, Mead, Toone, Hemp and Alessia would be options.

Nina: Kelly should 100% start. She has the technical ability, and she puts in good crosses. I would still have Agyemang on the bench as an impact sub, but Beever-Jones should start up top with Russo. Well done girls, your mentality won the game!

Jamie: Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang should start on the bench in the final... the first 60 minutes are not as important as the last 60 minutes, when they will probably be needed the most.

Charlie: I think you have to start Kelly in front of Hemp and keep Morgan in place of Carter. Le Tissier for Stanway? I'd keep Agyemang on the bench, but bring her on after 60 minutes if things aren't working.

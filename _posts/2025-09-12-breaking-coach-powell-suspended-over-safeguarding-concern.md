According to new developments, The only regular men's athletics event to have a longer standing world record than long jump is the hammer throw

Long jump world record holder Mike Powell has been suspended indefinitely over a safeguarding concern, says the Athletics Integrity Unit.

The 61-year-old American, who now works as a college coach, is barred from all activities sanctioned by World Athletics, its area associations or member federations.

The two-time Olympic silver medallist joined the track and field coaching staff at Azusa Pacific University in California in 2022.

He is also prohibited from attending hospitality or private access venues linked to World Athletics Series events. The AIU said the suspension could be varied on application or appeal.

Azusa Pacific University has been approached for comment.

Powell set the men's long jump world record of 8.95 metres at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo.

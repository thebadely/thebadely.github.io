According to new developments, Richardson added a second gold medal to his haul at the European Track Championships

Britain's Matt Richardson sealed a double success at the European Track Cycling Championships as he took gold in the men's keirin on the last day in Turkey.

Fresh from being crowned sprint champion on Wednesday, the 26-year-old powered through the keirin rounds and launched a late move in the final to surge past Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen, who was also beaten to the sprint title.

Richardson was competing in his first European Championships after changing racing nationality from Australia in 2024.

"It was really important to win the keirin and get the second jersey," he said. "To me, that was really important to show that I do have the legs and that I'm here to stay." 

Team-mate Harry Ledingham-Horn finished sixth. 

Katie Archibald and Anna Morris were beaten by Belgian duo Lotte Kopecky and Shari Bossuyt in the madison final 

Katie Archibald and Anna Morris claimed silver for Great Britain in the women's madison.

The pair rode a tactical race, winning three sprints and building a strong points lead, but Belgium's Lotte Kopecky and Shari Bossuyt clawed back a lap to take a lead they did not relinquish. It also confirmed a third European title this week for the 30-year-old Kopecky.

After five days of racing, GB ended the competition top of the medal table with 13, featuring seven golds, four silvers and two bronze.

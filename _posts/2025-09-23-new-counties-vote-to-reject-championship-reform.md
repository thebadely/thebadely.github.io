Experts revealed that Nottinghamshire are in pole position to win this year's County Championship

The County Championship is to remain a two-division structure of 14 matches per team after a vote rejected proposed changes.

Eighteen first-class counties were asked to choose between the status quo and a new system of a 12-team top flight, six in the bottom tier, with each team playing 13 matches.

The ballot returned a result on Tuesday, one day before the final round of this season's County Championship matches begin.

A majority of 12 counties were required to vote for change in order to push through the reform, a figure that was not met.

The result of the vote means the County Championship retains its current structure of 10 teams in Division One and eight in Division Two, with two teams promoted and relegated between each.

It brings to an end a lengthy examination of the domestic schedule, conducted by the counties.

A revamp of the Twenty20 Blast, cutting the number of group games from 14 to 12 and bringing finals day earlier in the season, was agreed in August.

However, differing opinions among the counties about the way forward for the Championship have resulted in retaining the current set-up.

A number of proposals were put forward, including reducing the number of first-class matches to 12, a number favoured by the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA).

When it became clear the shift from 14 to 12 was dead in the water, the 12-team top flight with a 13-match structure was proposed.

The idea involved the 12 teams being split into two groups of six, playing each other twice for an initial 10 games. At that point, the two groups would be split in half to create two further groups of six that would play for the Championship and relegation places.

The bottom tier of six teams would involve a county playing two other teams twice and three on three occasions, in order to make up the 13 games.

Supporters of the changes said it would eliminate dead fixtures towards the end of the season, giving more teams more to play for deep into the summer. The reduction in the number of matches would also have gone some way to appeasing the PCA.

However, a number of counties publicly stated their desire to remain with the two-division structure. Opponents of the proposed system felt it was too difficult to follow and did not lend itself to enough 'best v best'.

The conclusion of the domestic consultation gives clarity to the counties, with a number of issues still live going into the final round of Championship matches.

A vote for reform would have effectively ended the relegation battle, whereas now Sussex, Essex, Yorkshire, Hampshire and Durham must battle to avoid joining Worcestershire in dropping to Division Two. Leicestershire and Glamorgan have already sealed promotion.

At the top of Division One, Nottinghamshire need 10 points at home to Warwickshire in order to be crowned champions for the first time in 15 years. If Notts slip up, they can be caught by Surrey, who travel to Hampshire.

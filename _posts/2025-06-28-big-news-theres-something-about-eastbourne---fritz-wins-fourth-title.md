Fritz sees off Brooksby to win fourth Eastbourne title

World number five Taylor Fritz says "there's something about Eastbourne" after he won his fourth title at the tournament by cruising past fellow American Jenson Brooksby.

Fritz beat Brooksby 7-5 6-1, imposing control over the match by winning eight of the final nine games.

Victory means two-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist Fritz has won seven of his eight matches on grass this year, having defeated world number three Alexander Zverev in the Stuttgart Open final two weeks ago.

Last year's US Open runner-up will be looking to push on and challenge for the Wimbledon title over the coming fortnight.

The Californian begins his campaign against French world number 36 Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard on Monday.

"There's something about Eastbourne," said Fritz, 27, in his on-court interview. "I just love it here. Every year I come here and it's such a good week.

"This year it's been different and I've had to fight through my matches. I feel like I've really upped my level."

Asked about his Wimbledon chances, Fritz said: "I'm going to be ready to go. I'd much rather go into the tournament with confidence and a title."

As for Brooksby, defeat ended the world number 149's impressive run.

He was the first lucky loser to play in an Eastbourne final, having lost in the second round of qualifying.

Elsewhere, the Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor won his first title in two years by beating Frenchman Corentin Moutet 7-5 7-6 (7-3) in the final of the Mallorca Championships.

How Pavlyuchenkova's 'incredible mental toughness' overcame glaring error

Briton Sonay Kartal says people have "gotten to know me a little bit better" during her run to the fourth round at Wimbledon, where she fell just short of reaching a first Grand Slam quarter-final.

Kartal was enjoying her best run at a major but succumbed 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 to the experience and know-how of former French Open finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in a match that saw controversy over a faulty line call.

Play was halted by the umpire in the ninth game of the first set when Kartal's backhand dropped long but the electronic line-calling system failed to call it out and the point had to be replayed.

Although Pavlyuchenkova ultimately progressed, it has been a gallant effort from Kartal, who was ranked outside the world's top-250 players this time last year.

"I think I have definitely had a bit more attention on me this week from people recognising me to fans around the grounds to my social media. It's kind of blown up a bit," the 23-year-old said.

"The better in tournaments I do, I guess the more exposure I get. I think it will naturally come. But I'd say that people have gotten to know me a little bit better this week."

The rising star of British tennis will take comfort in her achievements - victory over a top-20 player in the first round, resilience to come from behind when needed and a memorable Centre Court debut in front of a partisan crowd at her home Grand Slam.

Her efforts at the All England Club will see her attain a new career-high ranking after the tournament.

'They stole the game' - electronic line call fails at Wimbledon

Ranked 51 in the world, Kartal had never gone beyond the third round at a Grand Slam and was aiming to become the first British woman to reach the quarter-finals at SW19 since Johanna Konta in 2019.

Having had to self-fund her way to events as a teenager and travel to tournaments without a coach, Kartal's run to the fourth round has seen her earn Â£240,000.

When asked what she would spend that on, she said it would be "reinvested into the tennis" and it is that dedication that will see her rise into the world's top 50 come the end of Wimbledon.

"This week I've proved to myself that I can go deep into slams, I can beat some of the best players on tour," she added.

Had she reached the quarter-finals she would have become British number one but instead will take second place behind Katie Boulter and ahead of Emma Raducanu.

Against Russia's Pavlyuchenkova, there were six breaks of serve in a contest reflective of the one place that separates them in the rankings.

Pavlyuchenkova's heavy-hitting style brought more winners but also more unforced errors as Kartal took advantage of her speed to chase the ball down, clearly unhampered despite the heavy strapping to her knee.

The feeling of both players having to grind it out continued throughout the first set with more break points on both sides.

Kartal wins controversial game after electronic line-calling system fails

The tension was ramped up further when, on Pavlyuchenkova's game point on serve at 4-4, Kartal's backhand dropped long but the electronic line-calling system failed to call it.

Kartal then went on to break in a game that Pavlyuchenkova should have won and the Russian fumed at the change of ends but regrouped to put the controversy behind her and take the opening set after a tie-break.

After a drama-filled one hour and 18 minutes, set two was a much lower-key affair.

Pavlyuchenkova, perhaps fuelled by her frustration at the technology failure, turned up the pressure to break in the fifth game and that proved to be decisive as she served out victory to book her place in the last eight with a ripping forehand.

For Kartal, it was an unfortunate incident that tinged her final match in a fearless run at the All England Club, which firmly cements her as a serious talent in the minds of the home crowd.

"For the rest of the day I'll be a bit sad," said Kartal. "But I think tomorrow I'll probably wake up, and I can look back on this week and be super proud of it.

"I'll hopefully see that I have maybe inspired some people this week."

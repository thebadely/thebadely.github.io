Here’s what you need to know: Alexander Isak has been at Newcastle since 2022

As the new Premier League season draws closer, the uncertainty over Alexander Isak's future has intensified.

Newcastle begin their campaign away to Aston Villa on 16 August but they appear far from ready with just one player - Anthony Elanga - signed this summer and their talismanic striker seemingly determined to leave the club.

With his team-mates away on a pre-season tour in Asia, Isak has been training at his old club Real Sociedad as he recovers from a "minor thigh injury".

Should he leave, Newcastle will rightly be expecting a significant fee for a player who has scored more than 20 Premier League goals in each of the last two seasons.

But, having just rejected a bid from Liverpool, what happens if Isak starts the season at St James' Park?

When Isak joined Newcastle in a deal worth Â£60m from Real Sociedad three years ago he said one of the reasons he moved was because he believed in their project.

Part of that will have been to secure a return to European football, which they did in his debut season as he scored 10 goals in 27 games to help them finish fourth in the Premier League.

Isak followed that with 21 league goals in 2023-24 and 23 last season, helping the club book a return to the Champions League, while also scoring the decisive goal in the League Cup final as Newcastle ended their 70-year wait for domestic silverware. 

Since joining Newcastle only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (84) and Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (65) have scored more goals in the Premier League than Isak's total of 50.

The Sweden international's numbers over the last couple of seasons has him rubbing shoulders with some of Europe's leading marksmen over the same period.

Isak outperformed his xG by 3.3 during this spell, with his 44 strikes coming from an expected goals of 40.7.

"Isak is Newcastle's best striker since Alan Shearer," said Matthew Raisbeck, who covers the club for BBC Radio Newcastle.

"He is the player who scored the decisive goal at Wembley - one of many special moments in black and white - and he was worshipped on Tyneside. 

"But that relationship has been damaged."

The noises from Newcastle themselves do not suggest Isak has no future at the club - should a move elsewhere fail to materialise.

The expectation is the 25-year-old will return to training with his team-mates from next week.

"He is still our player," said manager Eddie Howe.

"He's contracted to us. We, to a degree, control what is next for him.

"I would love to believe all possibilities are still available to us. My wish is that he stays, but that's not in my full control.

"My wish is that he stays and we see him playing again next year."

That's the club's stance - but the supporters may feel a little differently.

Isak has rightly been idolised for his goals, but his desire to leave is a frustration for some.

"We've just had an amazing season, in which we won our first trophy in 70 years, and he helped us win that," said Lee Johnson from the Newcastle podcast True Faith.

"The hope was that this summer would have been a transformation for ourselves but it seems to be turning into a bit of a nightmare now."

Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey added: "He's at a club who absolutely adore him. He'll be on unbelievable money, they've won something and they're in the Champions League - it would have to be some club to want to leave for.

"He has been looked after very well by Newcastle, has three years left on his contract and we're open to giving him a pay rise, but for him to have his head turned is just disappointing at this stage.

"You have to agree with the fans' frustration because you have the nucleus of a very good team."

I hope Isak stays - Howe

Isak's goals alone have been worth 30 points to Newcastle since he joined, and that contribution will be difficult to replace.

A number of forwards have been identified to fill the void with Brentford's Yoane Wissa and RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko both targets.

Wissa scored 19 goals in the Premier League last season, while Sesko hit 13 in the Bundesliga and 21 in 45 games across all competitions.

They are quality players but, for a number of reasons, movement in the transfer market for Newcastle this summer has been slow and frustrating.

The club are without a director of football or chief executive, which will have impacted their ability to do business, while keeping within Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) has meant they have been unable to spend big in recent seasons.

One positive of a big-money move for Isak - with a fee of around Â£150m being suggested - would give Newcastle the flexibility to make some top-class additions.

But the timing of any departure is going to be key.

"There is an acceptance Newcastle need to become better at selling players," admitted Raisbeck.

"It's something former sporting director Paul Mitchell alluded to last year to when he described their transfer strategy prior to his arrival as "not fit for purpose.

"It is the first time since the takeover in October 2021 another club has come for one of their big names.

"Many fans are worried about the impact on the dressing room and fear others will see a move away from St James' Park as the best thing for their careers.

"The ownership have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in Newcastle over the last four years and the message is that they remain committed to taking the club to the top.

"The Isak money, should they sell, will boost their PSR position and hopefully enable them to add more depth and quality to their squad - something they have really struggled to do in this transfer window."

Supporter and True Faith podcaster Charlotte Robson added: "Make no mistake: losing Isak without a replacement ready would be catastrophic for Newcastle United.

"I don't think it is controversial to say it is going to be very difficult to progress in the Champions League without a striker in the squad."

Should Newcastle resist a sale, they would retain a player who is arguably one of the world's best strikers.

"I think he might [start the season at Newcastle] but I don't think he will play," supporter Morris told BBC Radio Newcastle. 

"But if Eddie Howe put him on the pitch he would still give his all.

"He scores all sorts of goals, he is the best striker we've had since Alan Shearer."

"I love watching him," added former Newcastle defender John Anderson. 

"He is a top player who scores goals and creates goals, and frightens the life out of defenders."

Stay or go, the saga of Isak's future has undoubtedly hampered Newcastle's preparations for the new campaign.

But whatever happens, it doesn't necessarily mean the club will be in for a difficult season.

"It has certainly been a tough few months," added Raisbeck.

"But, they were in a difficult place 12 months ago with PSR pressures, changes at executive level, and speculation about the manager's future. What followed was the most successful season the club has had. 

"With Eddie Howe in charge and some outstanding players in his squad, anything is possible."

Should he go, a move to Premier League champions Liverpool seems the most likely.

The Reds are investing heavily as they look to push on next season, and see Isak as the man to lead their frontline.

But Liverpool fans appear torn.

"Let's be honest, this is just us being greedy," said supporter Callum.

"He would be a great addition to the squad - any team would happily take him - but we just have so much threat in the attack that we simply don't need him to the point of spending more than Â£100m."

Fellow fan Michael believes there are other priorities within the team.

"It's getting silly this," he added. "If there are funds to spend get a centre-back - that's the cover we need. We do not need another forward. Just because there's money, it doesn't mean we must spend it."

But fellow Liverpool fan Simon said: "If Isak is available and Liverpool can afford him, then go for it. 

"This will take Liverpool to the same level that Manchester City have been at for the past few seasons. 

"When you are champions, you make your team better. All the great teams do the same."

According to new developments, Salah and Jota helped Liverpool win the Premier League last season 

Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has said it is "going to be extremely difficult to accept" the death of fellow Reds player Diogo Jota.

Jota, aged 28, died in a car crash along with his brother Andre Silva, who was 25.

"I am truly lost for words," said Salah, who joined Liverpool in the summer of 2017.

"Until yesterday, I never thought there would be something that would frighten me of going back to Liverpool after the break. Team-mates come and go but not like this. 

"It's going to be extremely difficult to accept that Diogo won't be there when we go back. 

"My thoughts are with his wife, his children, and of course his parents who suddenly lost their children. Those close to Diogo and his brother Andre need all the support they can get. They will never be forgotten."

The Guardia Civil told BBC Sport both men died at about 00:30 local time on Thursday.

Jota was on his way back to Liverpool for pre-season and, as doctors had advised him against flying because he had undergone minor surgery, he was making the trip by car and ferry.

Doctor Miguel Goncalves, who worked with Jota on his recovery, described him as an "unparalleled professional".

He told Portuguese sports newspaper Record: "I started working with him last Saturday and I was with him every day until this Wednesday. I said goodbye to him at dinner time. 

"He made an extraordinary recovery - he was undoubtedly an unparalleled professional. He strictly followed what I told him, as you could see in the way he was recovering.

"He was excited, confident in his recovery and enthusiastic about the next season."

He married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with who he had three children, 11 days before the fatal crash.

Several Liverpool players were scheduled to return on Friday from their summer break for an initial round of physical tests at the club's training ground.

That was postponed and there will now be a phased return for players on Monday.

Liverpool manager Arne Slot's side are set to play their first pre-season match against Preston North End on Sunday, 13 July.

Former Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher also paid tribute to "one of my closest friends in football". 

"We bonded over all things, sports, watching any football match we could find - often your brother Andre's game on your iPad," said Kelleher.

"I was surprised a lad from Portugal loved sports such as darts, snooker and horse racing so much and some of my best memories were having a laugh watching them with you.

"It's going hurt for a long time and I'm going miss you so much but I feel so lucky to have got to know you and have such a good friend."

A vigil for Jota and Silva was held at the Chapel of Resurrection in their hometown of Gondomar later on Friday.

There will be a funeral service at 10:00 on Saturday at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar.

Portugal and Nottingham Forest midfielder Jota Silva laid a wreath outside the chapel, where a private wake for the brothers' relatives took place on Friday afternoon.

Locals and fans have been paying tribute to Jota outside the football academy in Gondomar where he played from the age of nine to 17.

The academy is named after him and a picture shows Jota wearing both the colours of the Portugal national side and the yellow of his hometown club as a child.

People have also been paying their respects at Liverpool and former club Wolves, who he left in 2020 to join the Reds. 

Everton players Beto and Youssef Chermiti, who are both Portuguese, and former Toffees midfielder Ian Snodin laid wreaths in Jota and Silva's memory outside Anfield.

Liverpool have set up a book of condolences in the Anfield Road Stand reception area and an online version of the book has also been made available to be "accessible to fans across the globe".

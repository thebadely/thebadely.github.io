Experts revealed that Kieran Tierney and Brendan Rodgers at full-time in Serbia

"We are where we are. This is a good point for this group of players."

Brendan Rodgers' immediate post-match reaction to Celtic's Europa League opening draw away to Red Star Belgrade is arguably a sign of their new norm.

Twelve months ago, on the eve of their Champions League curtain raiser against Slovan Bratislava, the manager said he was "in the best place I've been" at the club.

After a painful play-off defeat to Kairat Almaty ended hopes of participating in the elite competition again this season, the Scottish champions - after much criticism - were consigned to the Europa League. 

Their return to the second-tier competition was initially an impotent one, but the introduction of goalscorer Kelechi Iheanacho ignited their play and provided what Rodgers called "a great platform" of a first point. 

From feeling "the most ready" for a crack at the Champions League one year ago to requesting "realism" in the Europa League, what is Celtic's European landscape looking like now?

Sportsound: Celtic start Europa League with draw against Red Star

Had this draw in the raucous Marakana been in the Champions League, the praise may have been piling in.

But while Celtic were enduring their calamity in Almaty, Red Star were left red-faced by Cypriot champions Pafos in the play-off.

Both sets of supporters had been were sick at their respective sides' exits, and the disgruntled fans of former European champions Red Star made it known with the swathes of empty seats around the ground.

Still, though, signs outside the stadium read 'Welcome to Hellgrade'. And it's far from said in jest.

However, teenage right-back Colby Donovan was not daunted, while winger Sebastian Tounekti still pulled out his tricks on his European bow for the Scottish champions.

Those two were the only fresh faces from the side who were knocked out in Kazakhstan, and though they were in different competitions, a strong case could be made this was the trickier trip.

A notable difference from Almaty was Rodgers' ability to call on natural number nine in Iheanacho.

There was little fanfare from the stands when the free agent arrived at Parkhead, but he proved his worth in Belgrade by offering Celtic a focal point and Rodgers an option.

The former Manchester City and Leicester City forward was the only substitute out warming up at half-time and he was brought on for the restart.

Rodgers said he "could have made a couple of changes" but ultimately, he only opted to call on one.

A further four from the bench followed throughout the second half, but none matched the impact of the Nigeria international. 

Rodgers can only play the cards he's dealt, which don't include replacements for stars of Champions League campaigns gone by in Kyogo Furuhashi, Nicolas Kuhn and Jota.

The former left in January, the latter is a long-term injury lay-off after returning to Celtic, while Kuhn was destined to depart - in no small part due to his star rising on the biggest of stages - yet still Celtic failed to fill the gaps.

Which is why Rodgers said he was left feeling "empty" after a scant summer of transfer activity and why supporters have been protesting in recent weeks.

There's plenty heat swirling around the club from the stands, and that was before they touched down in the Serbian capital.

Hence Rodgers' call for "realism" when analysing the result against the backdrop of a spell of three years in the Champions League now at an end.

"I think that we are where we are and I think that tonight is a good point," the Northern Irishman told TNT Sports.

"You're probably not going to go win all eight games, so I think there's a bit of realism needed to it. 

"This is a good point for this squad of players and for us coming here.

"There'll always be criticism, but if you come to Belgrade and you get a point of a team that's won seven games out of seven [in the league] then we can really only focus on what we can do ourselves."

Walter: Good result away in a difficult place. Celtic can build on this.

Bez: Fantastic point away from home against a very well organised team.

Joe: The squad is stale and weak in ideas. They are devoid of energy and confidence.

Mark: Would have taken the draw beforehand but the chances we had were gilt-edged. Iheanacho could have had a hat-trick.

Jim: Fair result. Good contest but both sides lacked quality.

Robbie: Embarrassing for Celtic and Scottish football as a whole. If Celtic are the best we have, we're way off the pace. Can't believe people thought they gave account of themselves tonight.

Johnny: Same old Celtic and same old European campaign. Advancing beyond the group stage seems unlikely.

Amos: To be honest should we expect anything else? Celtic are actually weaker than at this stage last year with the lack of signings and the loss of good players.

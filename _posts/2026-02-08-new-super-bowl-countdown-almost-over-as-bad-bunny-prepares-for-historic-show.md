After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.

Super Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.

The Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.

Many stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.

Millions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.

And many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US president Donald Trump will not be one of them.

The Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.

Seattle's British coach Aden Durde on reaching the Super Bowl

After the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.

The Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.

Led by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

They will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.

This is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.

Quarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has helped turn the Seahawks into narrow favourites, thanks also to a fearsome defence led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.

Watch: Bad Bunny on how he's preparing for Super Bowl performance

Many of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.

Puerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.

He will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.

The 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.

Rock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.

Bad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.

The controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.

'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people' 

Trump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year but he said this year's on the west coast is "just too far away".

Asked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added:, external "I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred."

Bad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.

There were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.

But, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.

She added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.

Other visitors include Roger Federer, Jay Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.

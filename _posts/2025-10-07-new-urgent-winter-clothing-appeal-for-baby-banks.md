Let's dive into the details: A network of baby banks in London is urgently appealing for donations to help support families with young children this winter with clothes, blankets and other supplies. 

The charity Little Village, which represents a number of baby banks in the capital, told the BBC that supplies at their hubs were running low due to more families facing increased financial pressures. 

A survey by the charity found 81% of parents it currently helps felt they could not afford warm coats, boots or jumpers for their children. 

CEO Sophie Livingstone said increasing winter costs were "robbing parents of sleep and peace of mind," and she urged people to donate "before the cold sets in."

Little Village, which has hubs in Camden, Wandsworth, Brent, Hackney and Hounslow, receives referrals to its services from local community professionals, such as midwives, who come across families in need. 

The charity has previously told the BBC how it struggles to keep up with demand.

Its recent survey of families it helps found nearly two-thirds worry about food, nappies, wipes, and heating costs. 

Little Village said the research also revealed that parents were feeling stressed, anxious or could not sleep. 

During 2024 it distributed 6,752 coats, 14,163 pairs of shoes, 2,857 blankets, 1,472 items of bedding and 45,220 pairs of socks to families in need.

One mother supported by Little Village explained: "During the winter months, my family and I experience significant financial pressures.

"Heating and electricity bills increase and keeping the home warm becomes a major expense. 

"At the same time, we often need to buy warmer clothing and additional household items to cope with the cold, which adds to our financial strain. 

"We have to make difficult choices, such as cutting back on other essentials, just to get through the season."

The charity's appeal is supported by TV presenter Christine Lampard who said: "The fact that some little ones out there are facing the winter without something warm to wear is heart-breaking - as a mum, it just hits different.

"You know how quickly kids grow out of things, and those coats and boots still have so much life in them. 

"If you've got bits your kids have grown out of, please pass them on. It's such a small thing, but it could mean the world to another family."

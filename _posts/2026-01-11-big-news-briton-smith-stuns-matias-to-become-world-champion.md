Experts revealed that Dalton Smith (right) has won all 19 of his professional fights

Britain's Dalton Smith announced himself on the global stage with a coming-of-age stoppage of Subriel Matias to claim the WBC light-welterweight world title in New York.

In a fifth round that lit up Brooklyn's Barclays Center, Smith stood toe-to-toe with the heavy-handed Puerto Rican and dropped him with a looping overhand right.

Matias was left sprawled on the canvas. Although he beat the count, he staggered back to his feet, prompting the referee to wave the fight off.

"It's the first time in my career I've been the underdog and the first time I've fought a monster," said 28-year-old Smith.

"Take nothing away from Subriel - he's a great champion.

"I didn't really stick to the tactics tonight. I played him at his own game.

"I gave my dad a bit of a heart attack in there as that wasn't the gameplan, but I took all his best shots and thought 'you can't hurt me'. I knew I'd get to him."

Smith joins heavyweight Fabio Wardley, welterweight Lewis Crocker, super-featherweight Jazza Dickens and featherweight Nick Ball as one of the UK's five current male world champions.

Ticket sales were reportedly modest, but there was no shortage of noise from travelling supporters as Smith walked to the ring to 'When the sun goes down' by Arctic Monkeys, who are from his home town of Sheffield.

Yet it felt like a home fight for Matias, with New York's strong Puerto Rican population firmly behind the 33-year-old.

He appeared so relaxed that he stopped for selfies with family members during his ring walk.

Making the first defence of the title he won against Alberto Puello in July, Matias has at times been a slow starter and Smith exploited that by banking the opening round with sharp, crisp punches to head and body.

Matias edged the second, forcing Smith on to the back foot as blood trickled from the Briton's nose.

After a scrappy third, Smith unexpectedly chose to trade with the champion.

With 22 knockouts in his 23 wins, Matias entered with a reputation for relentless pressure and heavy hands. Smith, however, also carried stoppage power, having recorded 13 knockouts of his own.

He landed several heavy left hooks to close the fourth round. Then came the career-defining moment that truly announced Smith on the world stage.

After briefly stumbling from a Matias combination, an unfazed Smith came roaring back in a fifth-round firefight.

He landed two straight left-right combinations that snapped Matias' head back, before the decisive overhand right.

There was a brief protest from Matias at the referee's decision, while Smith's trainer and father, Grant, rushed into the ring in celebration.

Subriel Matias was stopped for the first time in 26 fights

Before the fight promoter Eddie Hearn said "justice shall be served", a remark widely interpreted as a reference to Matias' adverse drug-test findings.

Matias tested positive for banned substance ostarine in a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association out-of-competition test in November, with the B-sample also returning an adverse finding.

The New York State Athletic Commission ruled the concentration detected was below the threshold used by major boxing jurisdictions, allowing the bout to proceed.

During fight week, Smith spoke of his desire to emulate the late Ricky Hatton by building a fanbase willing to follow him to the US, and a world-title victory overseas will have won him plenty of new admirers.

"This is a message to every kid out there. Do not let anybody tell you can't achieve your dreams because if you work hard, you can do it," Smith said.

By winning a first world title in the US, Smith joins an exclusive list of British fighters including Bob Fitzsimmons, Alan Minter, Lloyd Honeyghan, Nigel Benn, Darren Barker, James DeGale and Kell Brook.

Smith can now set his sights on the division's other top contenders. WBO and Ring Magazine titleholder Teofimo Lopez is set to face Shakur Stevenson on 31 January, while Gary Russell holds the WBA belt and Richardson Hitchins is the IBF champion.

"Show me the money," Smith said. "Let me enjoy this moment now - I'm going to embrace it. The future is bright."

Matchroom boss Hearn has hinted that a homecoming celebration could be next.

"Smith has announced himself as the light-welterweight superstar," Hearn said.

"Now, fighting at Hillsbrough (Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's ground) is a reality."

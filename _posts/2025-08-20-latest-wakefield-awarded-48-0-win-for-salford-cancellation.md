Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Salford Red Devils have now lost 20 out of 22 Super League games this season and conceded 988 points so far - over 350 more than anyone else

The Rugby Football League (RFL) has awarded Wakefield Trinity a 48-0 win for last week's cancelled Super League game at Salford Red Devils.

The match was called off because of significant welfare concerns, with Salford only having two players available who had featured in the competition in the past 12 months.

The Red Devils, who have seen most of their senior players leave this season because of ongoing financial concerns, have said they will play Friday's scheduled game against Leigh Leopards.

On the judgement, the RFL said in a statement:, external "This is in line with operational rule B1:23, and taking into account the circumstances behind Salford's cancellation of the fixture, and the advanced stage of the Super League season."

The result means that Wakefield are now one point behind sixth-placed Hull FC as they look to secure the final play-off place with five games remaining.

Salford remain bottom with two wins from 22 matches.

Their owners released a statement earlier in August to say the club would not be closing despite their money problems.

Chief operating officer Claire Bradbury resigned from her position last Thursday and alleged the club's ownership suggested she "sleep with someone at the Rugby Football League" to ease their situation. Salford said they will be "conducting a thorough internal investigation" into the allegations.

About 500 Salford Red Devils fans marched in protest on Sunday against the way in which the club is being run, while Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham previously said he was watching the situation at the club carefully.

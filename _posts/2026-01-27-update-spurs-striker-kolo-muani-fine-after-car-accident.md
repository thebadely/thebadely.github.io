Let's dive into the details: Kolo Muani is "fine" and is expected to be available for Spurs' match at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday.

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank says French forward Randal Kolo Muani is "fine" after being involved in a "minor accident".

Pictures circulated on social media on Tuesday showing the 27-year-old and Wilson Odobert standing next to a damaged Ferrari, although the Spurs winger was travelling in his own car and stopped to assist his team-mate. 

The accident happened as the pair were on their way to the airport for the club's trip to Germany and Wednesday's final Champions League group phase match at Eintracht Frankfurt (20:00 GMT).

Both Kolo Muani and compatriot Odobert were due to fly out later on Tuesday and boss Frank, speaking in his pre-match news conference, said "everyone else involved in the accident was fine".

"It was a tyre blowing up, so, they are little bit delayed, but they will land later tonight," he added.

Kolo Muani is on loan at Spurs from Paris St-Germain and has scored twice and assisted twice in Europe this season.

Frank "fully expects" both the frontman and Odobert to be available for the Frankfurt tie, where victory for his men will confirm a top-eight spot in the standings.

Spurs, however, will be without full-back Pedro Porro, who has a hamstring injury and "will be out for four weeks". Centre-back Micky van de Van has also not travelled due to a "minor thing", but could return for Sunday's Premier League home match with Manchester City (16:30 BST).

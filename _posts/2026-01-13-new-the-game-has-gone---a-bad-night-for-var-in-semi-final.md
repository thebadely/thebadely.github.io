Let's dive into the details: Man City beat Newcastle 2-0 in the first leg of League Cup semi-final

Manchester City's 2-0 win over Newcastle in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final was overshadowed by a contentious decision to disallow a goal from Antoine Semenyo in the second half. 

The Â£65m January signing fired City ahead on 53 minutes and thought he had added a second 10 minutes later when he flicked Tijjani Reijnders' cross past Nick Pope.

However, the forward was denied a third goal in two games for his new side after a five-and-a-half-minute VAR check adjudged Erling Haaland to have interfered with play from an offside position.

"The second goal should have stood," Semenyo said after the game.

Haaland was jostling for position with Newcastle's Malick Thiaw when he was deemed to have obstructed the defender from stopping Semenyo's effort.

Referee Chris Kavanagh watched the incident several times on the pitch-side monitor before announcing his decision to disallow the goal to the St James' Park crowd. 

Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Pep Guardiola said the disallowed goal will make his side "stronger".

Captain Bernardo Silva also voiced his frustration with the decision, particularly after the Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel admitted Phil Foden was wrongfully denied a penalty in his side's Premier League defeat at the same venue earlier this season.

"It should have been 3-0 but we are quite used to this at the moment," said Silva.

"It is so frustrating because the last time we came here we also had a lot of decisions go against us."

City eventually scored a second deep into stoppage time when Rayan Cherki fired past Pope.

Semenyo scores again - who are winners and losers of his arrival?

VAR errors increase: Each of the 13 mistakes so far this season

After a weekend where supporters enjoyed the FA Cup without VAR, this was the antithesis of the fans' football experience at St James' Park.

It took five minutes and 30 seconds from the moment Semenyo scored what he thought was Manchester City's second goal until referee Kavanagh made the VAR sign to disallow it.

The job of the VAR, Stuart Attwell, was made harder because the semi-automated offside technology failed, as it did when the two teams met in the Premier League in December. The players were too close together, so it meant Attwell had to revert to the old technology and draw lines.

The decision is technically correct in law, because Haaland was offside and in direct contact with a defender who could possibly have stopped the ball going into the goal.

But fans won't see it that way. They will see a perfectly legitimate goal with an offside offence which wouldn't have been noticed but for VAR.

If the decision had been quick, there would have been much more confidence. But the extended delay adds to the controversy and gives the impression the VAR was not certain. It would have been better if the VAR had left this alone.

A decision being technically right is not necessarily what the game wants in this context.

Former Chelsea and Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton agreed with Guardiola and Silva and said Kavanagh's verdict looked like a "sheer guess".

"I think the game has gone," added Sutton. "Is Thiaw really going to stop that? The distance from Semenyo is a yard, a yard and a half. Thiaw is not going to react to that."

Ex-Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp and Newcastle defender Dan Burn said it was the correct call to rule out Semenyo's effort, though both criticised the process. 

"If they had given the goal there wouldn't be one person that looked at this and thought it shouldn't have been allowed," said Redknapp.

"But by the letter of the law, whether we like it or not, it is the right decision."

Meanwhile, Burn, who missed the game through injury, added: "I do think it is the right decision, I just don't like the subjective offside. It's either offside, or it's not. 

"We don't want to see that, but by the letter of the law it should be disallowed."

Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards said: "I understand the process but VAR wasn't brought in for this reason here. 

"This is anti-goal which they said they weren't going to do, they said they weren't going to re-referee the game. 

"This for me is re-refereeing the game. They are both going at it. It might be right, but I don't think we should be taking away goals for this. Why take five minutes?"

Aman: Get rid of VAR! It's a joke, the officials are trying to find reasons to not award goals! There was no reason to rule out that second goal!

Mick: The worst VAR decision I have ever seen. There are re-refereeing the game.

George: As fans we didn't ask for VAR, it was pushed upon us and it's ruined the game. As soon as the ref goes to the screen we all know how it's going to pan out. It all just takes too long. Rubbish.

Finn: So VAR has decided that Haaland made Pope jump forward and try to stop the shot. WOW. Laughable.

Ian: That was a terrible decision of offside, you couldn't tell if it was on or offside! If it's not obvious it should be a goal! Football is supposed to be about scoring goals! VAR killing the game slowly.

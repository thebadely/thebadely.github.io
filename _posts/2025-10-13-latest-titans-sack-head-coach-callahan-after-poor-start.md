Let's dive into the details: Brian Callahan was appointed Tennessee Titans head coach in January 2024, finishing with three wins and 14 defeats in his first season

The Tennessee Titans have sacked head coach Brian Callahan following a disappointing start to the NFL season.

The Titans are bottom of the standings in the Southern Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) after five defeats and a solitary victory. 

They were beaten 20-10 by the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday in what was 41-year-old Callahan's final game at the helm.

Chad Brinker, the Titans' president of football operations, said Callahan was a person of "great character" and "these decisions are never easy".

"Our players, fans, and community deserve a football team that achieves a standard we are not currently meeting," Brinker added.

"We are committed to making the hard decisions necessary to reach and maintain that standard."

The Titans had the worst record in the NFL last year and had the first overall pick in the 2025 draft, selecting quarterback Cam Ward.

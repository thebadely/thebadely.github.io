Experts revealed that Noni Madueke has scored 20 goals in 92 games for Chelsea

The news Arsenal are closing in on a deal to sign winger Noni Madueke from Chelsea for just over Â£50m has prompted a backlash from some Gunners fans.

A petition has been set up and signed more than 4,000 times, #NoToMadueke has gained traction on X, and murals outside the club's Emirates Stadium have been vandalised with 'Arteta out'.

At 23, Madueke is already an England international, so why are some so against his signing?

Arsenal have signed six players from Chelsea in recent years - and Madueke will be the second this transfer window after goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Some fans believe the club should be chasing what they perceive to be 'bigger' names.

The Gunners have, for example, been linked with Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi Eze.

Responding to a post on our Arsenal page, Gunners fan Steve said: "It's underwhelming, really. A lot of money for a back-up player. He won't be a first-team choice over [Bukayo] Saka on the right and [Gabriel] Martinelli on the left.

"They should have got a cheaper back-up player and used the excess money to seal the [Viktor] Gyokeres deal.

"I think the other thing about this is that some Arsenal fans were hoping to get Rodrygo. This is now not happening as Arsenal don't have the money to spend.

"Is Madueke that sort of player that will win you the Prem? No, Rodrygo is, which is why there is disappointment in the ranks at Arsenal."

Andrew - a season ticket holder - said there was a difference between match-going fans and those on social media. 

 "The key word is 'online'," Andrew said. "These people signing petitions aren't Arsenal fans. They live in some parallel fantasy universe on social media where football is viewed like a video game.

"I'm a season ticket holder, and people who go to games believe in Arteta and trust his judgement because he's usually right.

"Madueke might not be an exciting signing now, but he could prove to be a very good one.

"[Nico] Williams was never coming, Rodrygo is a waste of money, [Anthony] Gordon is overrated and I don't think this affects Eze. We'll see how it all works out."

Will, meanwhile, thinks a lot of the frustration is around the money Arsenal are going to be paying to Chelsea.

"I reckon over half the fans don't think Madueke is a bad player. It's just the nature of the deal - Â£50m for a player who is going to sit on the bench behind Saka or look out of place on the left wing seems like poor business - particularly when this feels like a make-or-break season for major silverware.

"It's also that the money is going to Chelsea."

Madueke is part of Chelsea's Club World Cup squad, and came on as a substitute as they reached the final by beating Brazilian side Fluminense 2-0.

He joined the Blues from PSV Eindhoven in January 2023 for Â£30m and has scored 20 goals in 92 appearances.

Madueke was in the Tottenham academy before moving to the Netherlands in 2018.

He plays predominantly on the right, with 88% of his Premier League minutes having come on a side of the pitch that is dominated by Saka at Arsenal.

Saka, 23, started 108 of 114 league matches from 2021-22 to 2023-24 but missed three months of last season because of a hamstring inury.

Madueke would be a capable option as back-up to Saka but can also play on the left.

He was one of England's standout performers in the recent international break and his assist from the left for Harry Kane's winning goal against Andorra was one of three in his first seven matches.

Madueke also started four of the Blues' final five Premier League matches of the season on that side - plus the Conference League final - and he could be direct competition for Martinelli there.

Madueke is seen by Arsenal as a good fit, as someone who has played consistent trophy-winning first-team football over the past two seasons.

He has settled well on the international stage and, at 23, there is a feeling he will continue to develop and also increase his value.

There is, obviously, an awareness that Arsenal have signed players from Chelsea in the past but there are success stories within those deals.

Forward Kai Havertz has become vital to the Gunners, midfielder Jorginho was one of Arteta's most trusted leaders within the squad, and Kepa has joined after an impressive season at Bournemouth.

Sources around Arsenal say the initial fee for Madueke is under Â£50m - less than Newcastle's move for Anthony Elanga and Tottenham signing Mohammed Kudus.

When looking at the stats, you can see why Arteta might be excited about the prospect of signing Madueke.

His expected goals (9.6), his number of shots (80), touches in the opposition box (199) and progressive carries with the ball (242) were all higher than Martinelli and Saka in the Premier League last season.

Saka only played in 25 league matches compared to Madueke's 32, so it is a fairer comparison with Martinelli, who played 33 times.

Madueke also contributed a combined 10 goals and assists to Chelsea last season and could boost Arsenal's much-criticised attack.

Injuries plagued Arteta's side last season and they ended the season with limited options in attack as they fell away in the title race.

Madueke is one of the most direct wingers in the league and Arsenal, who mainly play against teams who defend deep against them, could benefit from his eagerness to beat his defender and get a shot at goal.

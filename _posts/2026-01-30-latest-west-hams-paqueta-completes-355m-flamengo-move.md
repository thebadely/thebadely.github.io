Let's dive into the details: Lucas Paqueta has made 61 appearances for Brazil since his debut in 2018

West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has completed a move to his first club Flamengo for more than 41m euros (Â£35.5m).

The 28-year-old, who came through the youth ranks at the Brazilian club, joined the Hammers in from Lyon in 2022 and made 139 appearances, scoring 23 goals and providing 15 assists. 

Paqueta was given permission to fly to his home country earlier this week to make the permanent move before the transfer deadline on 2 February.

West Ham had been open to a deal that would have seen the Brazil international remain at the London Stadium on loan for the rest of the season, but Flamengo pushed for a permanent move and have agreed a contract until December 2030.

Paqueta, who had 18 months remaining on his Hammers contract, has played 18 times in the Premier League this season and scored four goals.

Nuno Espirito Santo's side are currently third from bottom in the table, five points from safety, and visit Chelsea on Saturday (17:30 GMT).

West Ham have won three matches in succession for the first time since 2023 without Paqueta, but boss Nuno said the Brazilian had been a key player for the club. 

"For me, Lucas is a special player, a special person, he's a number 10," he added. 

"I think everything could be different, but the circumstances are what they are.

"He wanted to go to Brazil, and you keep moving, knowing that he's special person and special player and we wish him all the best.

Last summer, Paqueta was cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission - almost two years after the Football Association launched an investigation into him.

He was facing the prospect of a lifetime ban if found guilty but the regulatory commission found the four charges against him to be "not proven".

In December, Nuno revealed Paqueta was still affected by the investigation into the charges brought against him.

In a statement on Wednesday, West Ham said he wanted to return to Brazil for personal and family reasons, as the two-year wait for a resolution had caused him "significant mental strain". , external

With this move, Paqueta has fulfilled his longâheld ambition by returning to his native Brazil.

He had previously appeared settled in English football, having been the subject of an Â£80m bid from Manchester City in 2023. However, charges relating to alleged spotâfixing saw the deal collapse, threatened his career and contributed to a downturn in form.

Those close to Paqueta say his mental health suffered, he lost faith in the English football authorities and began to yearn for a return home.

Amid links to Flamengo in late December 2024, he quoted a song, Vem Me Buscar, by Brazilian gospel duo Jefferson and Suellen. The lyrics translate as "I'm not from here, I will return home, he comes to get me and with him I will go".

Although Paqueta eventually cleared his name, he continued to push for a move back to Brazil.

Negotiations between West Ham and Flamengo began on 23 December, led by sporting director Jose Boto, and concluded on 28 January. Flamengo were initially asked to pay around Â£52m, but negotiated the price down to Â£35.5m - a record fee paid by a Brazilian club.

West Ham were willing to be flexible on the price, but wanted Paqueta to stay on loan until the end of the season to help them avoid relegation. However, he felt he had outstayed his time in London, and his representatives secured his return to Rio de Janeiro.

In time, Paqueta is likely to be remembered fondly at West Ham, having helped them win the Europa Conference League, remained an active Brazil international during his spell and played a key role in one of the club's strongest sides in recent years under former manager David Moyes.

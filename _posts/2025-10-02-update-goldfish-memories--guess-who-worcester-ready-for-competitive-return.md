Experts revealed that Worcester Warriors take on Coventry in their return to competitive rugby in the opening game of the new Champ season

In any dream-like scenario, there is a point when you need to check if what you are seeing is really happening - the 'pinch yourself' moment, if you like.

On Saturday, the forearms of Worcester Warriors' fans may well be feeling the squeeze of thumb and forefinger.

Their dream first took reality's form two weeks ago with Warriors' friendly against treble-winning Bath - with the former Premiership club celebrating its rebirth after administration and more than 1,000 days fighting off the threat of extinction.

Sixways was a sell-out then and will be again for Coventry's visit as the newly rebranded Champ season begins, marking the long-awaited return of competitive rugby to the stadium.

Incredibly, head coach Matt Everard has Warriors ready. In just 12 weeks. From scratch.

"I've never seen a group spend so much time together away from the training ground - coffee, golf, beers, Fifa," he told BBC Hereford and Worcester.

"We have a mix of personalities and cultures but I think coming together in such a short period - just over 70 days ago - it's such a unique challenge, I think they've bought into that more."

Since taking on the job in July, Everard has fostered a brotherhood of 34 players, many of whom hang out constantly and live in the same apartment block in the city. 

"I love rugby but I'm definitely a people person first," Everard said.

"I enjoy watching a game but I much more enjoy a coffee and chat with someone and so do the coaches."

This dedicated man-management is the bedrock of Everard's desire to build a squad that is "blended" and "cares".

It has worked too, convincing former England international and Gloucester legend Billy Twelvetrees to come out of retirement to take on a player-coach role.

"Matt showed me around Sixways as a mate really but then we spoke about what it could possibly be," Twelvetrees said.

"I was genuinely excited driving home, thinking 'what a cool project he's got there'. 

"What intrigued me was what this project could be - it was an easy decision and I'm glad I did it."

Light-hearted moments also play a key role. 

Every backs meeting starts with a game of 'Guess Who?' where players' social media posts and pictures are anonymised and thrown up on screen to the general amusement of all.

Then there is the goldfish.

Assistant coach Tom Cruse uses the fish, in its tanks in a suite at Sixways, as a psychological device to help with match mentality.

"We use different analogies and one is 'have the memory of a goldfish'," Everard said.

"There's always going to be plenty of mistakes in rugby and it's what you do next that matters. So have the memory of a goldfish."

Worcester Warriors' pre-season game against Bath was the club's first match at Sixways since 25 September 2022

Warriors have had two pre-season games to get up to speed for the serious stuff.

Hartpury were beaten comfortably before last Friday's party hosting Bath, with Worcester leading 14-12 at half-time before the visitors took control after the break to win 33-19.

Everard said playing last season's Premiership champions gave him great feedback about where his side is at.

"I thought we were really physical, we took it to them," he said.

"The ruck is the most frequent episode of the game and I thought we had a good ding-dong there, we properly went at them.

"I was really proud of the lads' effort and physicality - I thought it was superb.

"Bath are one of the best teams in Europe and playing a team like that, they're going to highlight some bits we need to work on.

"I thought we could be a bit more clinical with the ball and we probably got a little bit tight defensively but it was only our second game together."

With preparations over, the opening-day derby with Coventry now takes centre stage and Everard is aware Worcester have to take a measured view of the future - despite the expectation levels.

"Our progression isn't going to be a straight line, we're not just going to fly," he said.

"It's a long-term project and I think everyone, including the fans, is aware of that.

"As long as we keep improving, and showing the effort we have so far, that will keep building. It's a tough league and it will be a full-squad effort."  

Everard is also aware Saturday's visitors will be well up for spoiling Warriors' moment.

"They'll be excited about coming to Sixways - they're really well coached. I know Alex Rae and he'll definitely get them emotional," he said.

"Their group's been together and has good continuity through it. It's going to be a really good challenge."

As for Coventry, head coach Rae says they make the short trip down the M42 and M5 mindful of the attention surrounding this fixture.

"Obviously it's been at the back of our minds," he told BBC CWR.

"It's already a sell-out. It's a fantastic set-up and, by their own admission, it's a Premiership ground with Premiership squad and Premiership coaching staff.

"So, listening to all that, we've got no chance - so that's a really good place to be.

"It'll be really interesting to see how we cope and I'm quietly confident the boys will be in a really good place."

Under this season's refresh, the Champ has increased to 14 teams following the addition of Worcester and National League 1 winners Richmond, and there is now the prospect of relegation and promotion play-offs.

"I think this is the most competitive the league's been in years," Rae said.

"We've kind of always separated it into a top four but I think now you're looking at six, seven or eight teams who fancy getting into that top six.

"I think there's some jeopardy thrown in there now and there's a lot more to think about."

Rae said he thinks Cov can go "under the radar" after their summer rebuild as they hope to improve on their sixth-placed finish last season.

"This year, Worcester's on everyone lips and [reigning champions] Ealing are a top, top team - they're going to be the proven ones who've been there and done it," he said.

"We'll have a game plan. There'll be quite a lot of emotion for them with it being their first league game. It was probably their cup final against Bath.

"It's going to be really important for us to go there and quieten the crowd down." 

This season's revamped Champ division will have 14 teams and feature relegation and promotion play-offs

Rae's party-pooper strategy will inevitably be used by all visitors to Sixways this season. 

Everard knows everyone will be gunning for his side but says it is important they use that positively.

"I recognise we may have a target on our backs and I think we should take that as a compliment," he said.

"We can use it to our advantage - as long as we're aware of it.

"We are so internally focused and if we start focusing on X, Y and Z we'll drift away from what we want to be."

Worcester wanted to be back. They are. So too, for the first time in 1,105 days, is competitive rugby at Sixways and if Bath felt too good to be true, Coventry's visit will confirm the glorious reality.

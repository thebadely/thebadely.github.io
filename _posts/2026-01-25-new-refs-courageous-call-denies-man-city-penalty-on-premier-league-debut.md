'Brave' debut referee Hallam made right decision - Shearer

Making your Premier League debut at Manchester City would be a daunting prospect for anyone - even as a referee.

But 32-year-old Farai Hallam, once a professional footballer on Stevenage's books, earned widespread praise for his performance during City's 2-0 win over Wolves at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

With the hosts leading 1-0 in the first half, goalscorer Omar Marmoush was convinced the hosts should be awarded a penalty after Wanderers defender Yerson Mosquera appeared to handle the ball inside the area.

Hallam was unmoved, waving appeals away, only to then be sent to the pitchside  monitor by the video assistant referee (VAR) to check the incident.

We all know what that normally means. The City fans were already celebrating.

After watching several replays, however, Hallam surprised nearly everyone inside the stadium by choosing to stick with his original decision.

"After review, the ball hits the arm of the Wolves player, which is in a natural position so the on-field decision will remain," he announced over the tannoy.

Former Premier League assistant referee Darren Cann said it was "without doubt the correct decision".

"Hallam, officiating in his first Premier League match, made an excellent and courageous call to stick with his on-field decision of no handball," Cann told BBC Sport.

"This was without doubt the correct decision as Yerson Mosquera's arm was in a justifiable position and the ball was played on to his arm from very close range.

"A brave and correct decision in law from a highly regarded referee making his Premier League debut."

Hallam only made his English Football League (EFL) debut in 2023, taking charge of his first Championship match - between Norwich and Bristol City - in November 2024.

His rise through the football pyramid has been swift.

As a youngster he had hopes of making it as a player, spending two years with Stevenage's academy from the age of 16 before being let go in 2012.

Within two years he had taken up refereeing.

"It's that grey zone and I think good on Farai Hallam," former Brighton and Crystal Palace forward Glenn Murray said on Final Score.

"On his debut, when one of his decisions has been questioned by the people inside the VAR hub, for him to have the confidence to stick to his decision needs praise."

Several BBC Sport readers also messaged to sing Hallam's praises:

Kev: Brave but good refereeing. Especially at their ground. Well played ref.

Caroline: City fan but well done ref, about time they started to stand up to VAR. Wish more refs would do that!

Andrew: Outstanding from a ref on his Premier League debut. Would have been easy to give in to pressure, being sent to the monitor like that, especially at City's home ground, but he stuck with his decision. It would have been incredibly harsh to give it.

Mike: I don't even care if it's the right decision, well done to the ref at City for making his OWN decision after being sent to the monitor by VAR. Whether you agree or not with the decision, it's his job to make it. I'm a City fan.

The two managers had mixed views on whether the correct decision was made.

"I thought his arm was in a natural position and it was really close," said Wolves boss Rob Edwards. "Fair play to Farai in his first game to make that call.

"I think it was the right call. My concern is the VAR have made him check it and just wasted four or five minutes."

City manager Pep Guardiola, however, was less complimentary.

"The referee made a huge debut, now everybody will know him," he said in his post-match news conference. "I think it's the first time they go to the TV and disallowed what is a 'normal' position of the arms.

"I'm pretty sure [Premier League referees' boss] Howard Webb tomorrow is going to appear in the media to explain why it's not a penalty and what he did against [Manchester] United, like it was the first time he had done it because there was a little bit of doubt.

"That's why Jeremy [Doku] could not play in Norway - for the action from [Diogo] Dalot. But it's OK. I'm waiting tomorrow. Don't wait for Wednesday - we have Champions League, we are busy - Howard Webb, come tomorrow and explain why it's not a penalty."

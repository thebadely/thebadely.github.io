It has been recently reported that Newcastle won the League Cup for the first time last season with a 2-1 win over Liverpool

Carabao Cup holders Newcastle will start the defence of their crown at home to League One Bradford in the third round. 

League Two Grimsby Town will travel to Championship Sheffield Wednesday after shocking Manchester United in a spectacular penalty shootout win at Blundell Park. 

Manchester City will take on League One Huddersfield Town at the Accu Stadium while Arsenal will travel to Port Vale. 

Reigning Premier League champions Liverpool, who were beaten in last season's final, will host Championship Southampton, while Chelsea have been handed a trip to Lincoln City. 

Brentford will host Aston Villa and Wolves will welcome Everton in the two all-Premier League ties. 

The eight teams in the Champions League and Europa League - Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa - were seeded to avoid scheduling clashes. 

Crystal Palace were not included in the seeding because the Conference League league phase does not get under way until October. 

The third round fixtures will take place across two weeks, beginning on 15 and 22 September with Champions League and Europa League fixtures also scheduled during this period.

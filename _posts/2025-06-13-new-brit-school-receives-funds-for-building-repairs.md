According to new developments, A renowned south London arts school has been awarded government funding to address poor building conditions, including a ceiling collapse.

The state of disrepair at the Brit School in Croydon, forced a classroom and changing rooms used by musical theatre students to close, according to the LDRS.

The school, known for its showbiz alumni including the singers Adele, Amy Winehouse and Leona Lewis, is among more than 70 in London receiving support this year through the Condition Improvement Fund (CIF).

"We are definitely fortunate to receive this funding, said Louise Cooper, chief operating officer at the school.

The CIF supports urgent repair and maintenance work in smaller academy trusts and voluntary-aided schools.

"We have funding for one project which will replace the majority of our main building roof," Ms Cooper said.

The school has also received funding for a second project, which will focus on fire safety works.

Its site houses five buildings dating from 1909 to 2012, some of which regularly face repair challenges.

Ms Cooper said: "In one of our older blocks, part of the ceiling came away recently, and we are going to need to replace that small piece of roof. However, until we do that, the changing rooms for musical theatre are closed, which is severely impacting their work."

The funding, announced in late May, is part of a £470m CIF package for 2025–26, up from £423.9m last year, according to the Department for Education.

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: "This investment is about more than just buildings, it's about showing children that their education matters, their futures matter."

Croydon West MP Sarah Jones said it was a "vital" step to ensure schools have safe, modern facilities. 

"It reflects the government's commitment to education in Croydon," she added.

Work at the Brit School and others across London is expected to start over the summer holidays.

Experts revealed that Eric Dier won the German title with Bayern Munich this month

English defender Eric Dier will join Monaco on a three-year deal when his Bayern Munich contract expires on 1 July.

Dier made 47 appearances for Bayern but turned down the chance to stay at Allianz Arena and will leave as a Bundesliga champion.

The 31-year-old initially joined the German club on loan from Tottenham in January 2024 before signing a permanent deal last summer. 

He will join Ligue 1 Monaco as a free agent until June 2028, with the option for an extra 12 months.

The German title is the first trophy won by Dier, who has been capped 49 times for England and finished as a runner-up with Spurs in the 2015 and 2021 League Cup finals, as well as the 2019 Champions League final.

Dier made 365 appearances in nine and a half seasons with Spurs, who he joined in August 2014 from Sporting Lisbon. 

In a video published on Monaco's X account, external, Dier posed with the club shirt and said: "I cannot wait to get started.

"I'm really looked forward to wearing this shirt and I can't wait to meet everyone at the club and the Stade Louis II. I'm going to give everything to the club."

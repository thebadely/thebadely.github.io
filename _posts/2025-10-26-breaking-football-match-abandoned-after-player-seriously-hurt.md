Hereâ€™s what you need to know: An FA Trophy game between Basingstoke and Dorchester was abandoned after a footballer suffered a serious injury to his neck.

Dorchester Town FC player and coach Wes Fogden was injured in the first half of the game, which was away at Basingstoke, on Saturday afternoon.

His club said in a statement: "Wes was conscious and talking as he was taken into the ambulance, and scans in hospital yesterday evening have confirmed two fractured vertebrae in his neck, which will require a number of weeks in a neck collar."

The first round fixture will be replayed on Tuesday.

Dorchester Town FC said it would provide further updates on Fogden's condition when it was able to.

It added: "We would like to place on record our thanks to all Magpies and Basingstoke staff and players who helped look after Wes yesterday on the pitch before he was taken to hospital.

"From everyone at the club, we send our love and very best wishes to Wes for a full and speedy recovery."

Basingstoke Town FC thanked physiotherapist Seanagh McCarthy "for her knowledge and professionalism in helping deal with the situation", and its supporters "for their classy reaction to yesterday's unfortunate event".

"In the immediacy of the moment it would have been easy to make light of what was happening before the full picture was clear," it said in a message to fans on X.

"Instead, you showed respect, empathy and patience for the injured player.

"The fact our fans returned to the touchline an hour later to applaud him as he was taken from the pitch summed it up perfectly."

The club also said it was relieved that Fogden was in "excellent hands".

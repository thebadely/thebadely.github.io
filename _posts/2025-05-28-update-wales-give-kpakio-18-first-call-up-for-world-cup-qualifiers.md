Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Ronan Kpakio has played for various Wales age-grade sides

Wales head coach Craig Bellamy has named Cardiff City teenager Ronan Kpakio in his squad for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Belgium.

Right-back Kpakio, who turned 18 this week, is included for the first time having been part of Wales' training camp in Spain earlier this month. 

Cardiff academy product Kpakio has only six senior Bluebirds appearances to his name. He made his debut in the EFL Cup last August before his first league start came on the final day of the Championship season.

Bellamy welcomes Ethan Ampadu and Harry Wilson back to his squad for games against Liechtenstein at the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday, 6 June and against Belgium in Brussels the following Monday.

Leeds United captain Ampadu, 24, and Fulham attacking midfielder Wilson, 28, were injured for the opening games of the campaign in March.

While two of Bellamy's key men return, captain Aaron Ramsey is missing through injury and there is no Joe Allen after he announced his retirement earlier this month.

Bellamy, who both played and coached at Cardiff, revealed that he has been impressed by Kpakio for some time, having kept tabs on the youngster even while he was part of Burnley's backroom staff.

"I've known Ronan since he was very, very young, I've kept an eye on him," Bellamy said.

"Even last year we wanted to buy him for Burnley, so I'm fully aware, I've watched him - especially over the last couple of years, his progression has been outstanding.

"His potential can be ridiculously high; he's very athletic, very intelligent.

"If he wasn't injured I would have had him in March, as he's a player, especially in the right-back position... where we don't have a big area [of selection choices] in there, so we really need to start developing players in that position.

"He's the perfect profile for that."

World Cup player? Boss? Ramsey's uncertain future

Bellamy has welcomed the return of two "quality" performers in Ampadu and Wilson. 

"Harry, if you look at his performances for us in the first six games (of Bellamy's reign)... the way he works for the team is incredible," he added.

"He's a remarkable player for us and he fits in really well with how we play. 

"Ethan we haven't had since September. I don't think we have someone at this present moment with his sort of profile, so he has been a loss. But we always adapt - we have to adapt.

"Sheehs (Josh Sheehan) has done really well in games where we control games. But games where there's going to be transition, which big games really bring, we need everyone available and having Ethan available is a big, big bonus for us."

Wales sit second in Group J after beginning their bid to secure a place at the 2026 World Cup with a 3-1 win against Kazakhstan and a 1-1 draw in North Macedonia. 

Several players will report for international duty after a successful end to the season at club level.

Brennan Johnson scored the only goal as Tottenham - who also included Ben Davies in their squad - beat Manchester United in the Europa League final, while Connor Roberts, Karl Darlow, Joe Rodon, Ampadu, Daniel James and Chris Mepham all secured promotion to the Premier League with their respective clubs.

North Macedonia currently top Group J ahead of Wales on goal difference, though top seeds Belgium are yet to start their campaign.

The group winners seal a place at the World Cup while four remaining berths will be determined by play-offs involving the 12 group runners-up and four teams from last year's Nations League phase.

Wales are already well placed to secure a play-off place - should they need it - having topped their Nations League group.

Goalkeepers: Karl Darlow, Danny Ward, Adam Davies.

Defenders: Neco Williams, Jay Dasilva, Connor Roberts, Ronan Kpakio, Ben Davies, Chris Mepham, Ben Cabango, Joe Rodon.

Midfielders: Josh Sheehan, Charlie Crew, Ethan Ampadu, Jordan James, Ollie Cooper, Harry Wilson, David Brooks, Sorba Thomas.

Forwards: Liam Cullen, Nathan Broadhead, Lewis Koumas, Rabbi Matondo, Kieffer Moore, Mark Harris, Brennan Johnson, Daniel James.

Let's dive into the details: Shanghai Shenhua finished two points behind champions Shanghai Port last season

Nine teams will start the upcoming Chinese Super League season on minus points after clubs were sanctioned following an investigation into "match-fixing, gambling, and corruption in the football industry".

Shanghai Shenhua, last season's runners-up, suffered the toughest sanction alongside Tianjin Tigers, with the pair receiving a 10-point deduction each.

Four punished sides have already been relegated to China League One.

The 13 teams have also been fined between Â£21,000 and Â£104,000 (200,000 and one million yuan).

The punishments were handed out by authorities as a result of an investigation into football-related gambling and match manipulation.

A statement, external said the penalties were intended "To uphold industry discipline, purify the football environment, and maintain fair competition."

"The point deductions and financial penalties imposed on clubs are based on the amount, nature, seriousness and social impact of the improper transactions in which each club was involved," the CFA said, adding that it would maintain its "zero-tolerance" policy toward corruption.

In September 2024, 43 officials and players were hit with lifetime bans.

Former Everton midfielder Li Tie, along with 73 other people, have also been banned from football for life.

The 48-year-old was jailed last year after admitting to fixing matches, accepting bribes, and offering bribes to get a top coaching job.

Experts revealed that Matty Cash has 22 caps for Poland

Aston Villa defender Matty Cash has signed a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the club until 2029.

The Poland international joined Villa from Nottingham Forest in 2020, and has gone on to make 193 appearances in claret and blue.

Cash, whose previous deal was set to expire in 2027, scored his second goal of the campaign as Villa beat Manchester City 1-0 on Sunday.

"I'm playing with a lot of confidence," Cash said on Sunday. 

"To be honest, I've always had a good shot, I've just never really shown it in games.

"This season it seems to be going my way and every time I get the ball on the edge of the box, I've got confidence and feel like I'm going to hit the target a lot of the time."

The 28-year-old, whose mother is Polish, is first choice right-back for both Villa and Poland.

He made his international debut in 2021, and went on to represent Poland at the 2022 World Cup.

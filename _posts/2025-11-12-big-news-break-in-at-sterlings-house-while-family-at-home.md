Let's dive into the details: Raheem Sterling has scored 20 goals in 82 games for England

Burglars broke into England forward Raheem Sterling's house while he and his family were at home on Saturday.

They were not harmed during the break-in, which took place shortly before Sterling's Chelsea played Wolves in the Premier League.

Sterling, who has not featured for the Blues this season, was at home in Berkshire with partner Paige Milian and their children, having not been named in the squad.

"Whilst the ultimate violation of privacy and safety, we are thankful to be able to confirm that he and his loved ones are all safe," said a representative for Sterling.

A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said: "We are investigating a burglary at around 6.30pm on Saturday.

"Officers are conducting a thorough investigation and ask anyone with information, or if they saw anyone in the area acting suspiciously, to contact police."

It is at least the third time that Sterling has been targeted by burglars.

He left England's camp at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar when his family home was robbed shortly before the quarter-final against France.

Three burglars who targeted the homes of "high-wealth individuals", including Sterling, were jailed in 2020 for a series of raids.

Sterling joined Chelsea from Manchester City in 2022 and spent last season on loan at Arsenal.

He failed to secure a move away from Stamford Bridge in the summer and has been training separately from Chelsea's first-team squad this season.

Here’s what you need to know: Salford Red Devils finished bottom of Super League in 2025

The Rugby Football League has given a new Salford team Championship membership for 2026, three weeks after the old club was wound up.

A consortium led by former Red Devils player Mason Caton-Brown has been chosen from three "high-quality" proposals to take on the club.

The RFL said the submission from Salford RLFC Ltd "demonstrated a clear commitment to sustainable governance, financial responsibility and long-term stability".

Caton-Brown told BBC Radio Manchester earlier this month that he had a head coach and players ready to join the new club but they now face a race against time to get prepared for a scheduled season-opener against Oldham on 16 January.

"We've already got a few agreements with some players and should this bid be successful we can turn them into concrete agreements with the players and I'm really confident we can get a full squad out on our first game," he said at the time.

"We've got a coach lined up and he's really really enthusiastic and ready to go. He's been working a lot trying to talk to players as well."

Salford Red Devils were wound up on 3 December after a turbulent year, with a mass player exodus, late wage payments, heavy defeats and ultimately the loss of their Super League status for 2026.

The High Court decision ended the 152-year-old club but hopes were quickly raised that a phoenix club could be able to enter the second-tier Championship in 2026.

A consortium with former Salford chief executive Chris Irwin was also in the running to lead the new club and the RFL said they hoped the unsuccessful parties could work alongside Caton-Brown's group in a "mutually beneficial way".

"The quality of proposals we received reflects the strength of commitment to rugby league in Salford," said RFL interim chief executive officer Abi Ekoku.

"Our decision, which could not have been made without the clarity and support of Salford City Council and its stadium management team (CosCos), has been taken with the long-term interests of the club, the local community at its heart and the sport of rugby league as a whole."

Salford may now be in existence for 2026 but the hard work starts now for Mason Caton-Brown, Malcolm Crompton and Paul Hancock in putting the meat on the bones.

The most important thing for a rugby team is players, and Salford are now hugely behind the eight-ball, not to mention feeding from the bottom end of the proverbial trough - most clubs have had their recruitment in place for a considerable time, so Salford will largely be looking at those out-of-contract players or youngsters looking for an opportunity rather than established names.

There is also a coaching team, plus performance and medical staff to appoint, to guide this new venture. The off-field personnel is also a consideration but the footballing side is a priority.

If this new outfit retains its number one seeding from the previous club's IMG grading, then their central distribution amount - albeit not in the same bracket as Super League income - will be among the highest in the division. That said, the bulk of the outlay will come from the new ownership.

But they have a chance now. The Championship season kicks off on 16 January. Whatever team turns up for Oldham on that Friday night, it will at least be on the grid.

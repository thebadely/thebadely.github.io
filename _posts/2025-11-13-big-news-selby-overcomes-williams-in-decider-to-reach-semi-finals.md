Here’s what you need to know: Mark Selby is a four-time world champion

Mark Selby beat defending champion Mark Williams 6-5 in a final-frame decider to reach the semi-finals of the Champion of Champions in Leicester.

In a high-quality opening between two of the greats - who hold seven world titles between them - Wales' Williams took the first two frames with breaks of 77 and 114. 

England's Selby responded with two half centuries and a wonderful break of 136 as he reeled off the next four frames to lead 4-2, before Williams replied by edging three hard-fought frames to go 5-4 up.

However, Leicester-born Selby compiled a timely 95 to win the 10th frame and enjoyed a run of 55 to seal a thrilling victory.

The 42-year-old told ITV4: "It was mad towards the end. I felt like I had played really well to go 4-2 up. Mark did what he does, he dug in, showed his class, came back and the next minute I am 5-4 down and my head is spinning.

"I am just happy to get over the line. It is always nice to do well in your home city."

Earlier on Wednesday, Selby had defeated Alfie Burden 4-0, while the 50-year-old Williams won 4-0 against Scotland's Stephen Maguire.

On Thursday afternoon Australia's Neil Robertson takes on Englishman Tom Ford, while Scotland's John Higgins faces China's Xiao Guodong.

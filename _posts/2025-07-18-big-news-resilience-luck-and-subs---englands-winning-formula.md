England win on penalties after fightback against Sweden to advance to Euro semis

They couldn't do it again, could they?

England were 2-0 down at half-time of their quarter-final with Sweden at Euro 2025 - but managed to score two goals in as many minutes to draw level.

They could have lost three times in the shootout - but Chloe Kelly scored, Sweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk blasted over with a penalty of her own and England counterpart Hannah Hampton denied Sofia Jakobsson.

Sweden exposed England's defensive frailties again - but England manager Sarina Wiegman made the right substitutions to turn the game around in Zurich.

It was a tale of England's resilience, a large slice of luck and an explosive impact of the 'super-subs' as they booked a semi-final on Tuesday against Italy. Sound familiar?

They have become positive traits of England's major tournament journeys - the 'super-subs' proving the difference at Euro 2022 and the resilience, mixed with luck, taking them to the final at the 2023 World Cup when they missed key players.

"That's a quality that is so strong in this team, that togetherness and fighting back. It shows so much resilience," said manager Wiegman.

"We changed it and brought in other players. They brought different things to the game that really helped the team in that moment. 

"That is so powerful from this team. That luck as well, yes, at least three times I thought we were out."

England into semi-finals with dramatic shootout win

How the 'greatest and worst shootout of all time' unfolded

Wiegman's rotations arrived like clockwork in 2022 - midway through the second half, no matter the score, and always made a difference. 

She named the same starting XI for all six matches and backed her players to deliver the gameplan.

It has been similar in Switzerland, with Wiegman's selection remaining unchanged for a third successive match and her first substitution coming in the 70th minute against Sweden.

England had been carved apart by Sweden's pace in a relentless first half, and were still under pressure as goalkeeper Hampton made key saves after the break.

Defender Jess Carter had struggled against Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, meaning she had to swap with Leah Williamson and become the right-sided centre-back. 

Sweden, flowing with confidence, were brutally persistent and their fans buoyant, singing ABBA songs as England trailed 2-0.

Surely Wiegman would make changes at half-time? Surely she would react to Sweden's directness? Surely England had a Plan B?

But Wiegman has rarely swayed from her plan - because it usually works.

The introductions of Kelly, Beth Mead, Michelle Agyemang and Esme Morgan changed things. 

England were suddenly on the front foot. Kelly's deep cross was headed in at the back post by defender Lucy Bronze, and 103 seconds later, Agyemang made it 2-2.

It was the third time England had scored via a substitute at Euro 2025, more than any other team.

"I don't know why but this team is just incredible. They stick together," said Wiegman, when asked how her side continued to respond to setbacks. 

"We had a disappointing game against France but how the players came together, took responsibility and stepped up... they took action to make it better. 

"They do whatever is necessary to turn around a result like we did today. It is so impressive and I'm just really proud to be a part of this team."

Lucy Bronze's eventful match included putting tape on her own leg

England fans may had doubt but they did not show it at Stadion Letzigrund as those behind the goal to Wiegman's right sang her name as they trailed 2-0.

When things eventually started going to plan, England still relied on plenty of luck. 

The ball didn't quite drop for Sweden on set-pieces, and as extra time wore on, momentum felt like it was with England.

But in the shootout, it was Sweden's game to win. They had two chances to seal victory with penalties of their own and managed to squander both.

Sweden goalkeeper Falk wasted the first opportunity, blasting the ball over the crossbar, before Hampton dived low to save Jakobsson's spot-kick. 

As Sweden's senior players missed their opportunities, England's most experienced was ready to take her moment.

It was fitting that 33-year-old Bronze, playing in her seventh major tournament, delivered when it mattered.

Someone who epitomises England's resilience, she stepped up, took a deep breath and thumped her penalty into the roof of the net.

A roar erupted from Bronze as she looked at the supporters behind the goal, ripping off tape - that she had put on herself during the match - in the process.

Around half an hour earlier, she had kicked the hoardings behind the same net - a release of emotion as she kickstarted England's comeback. 

"Lucy was chaotic in herself, right? There was a lot going on with her. She became a physio, she became a striker, she nailed the best penalty of the day," said team-mate Mead. 

"I think Lucy really showed her experience in those moments. She's our most experienced England player and I think she was one of the players that very much got the determination out of us all today."

Having failed to convert four penalties, Wiegman admitted she was "really concerned" that England were heading out. 

But it was fitting that Bronze helped carry her team over the line.

"She is just one of a kind. I have never seen this before in my life. I have worked with so many incredible football players but what she does and her mentality," said Wiegman.

"The penalty, the goal - that is not what defines her. What defines her is that resilience, that fight. The only way to get her off the pitch is in a wheelchair."

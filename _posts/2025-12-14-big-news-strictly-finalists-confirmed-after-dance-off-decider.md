Here’s what you need to know: The three finalists for this year's Strictly Come Dancing have been confirmed, after one couple was eliminated from the competition in Sunday night's results show.

In the bottom two this week were EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal and her partner Julian Caillon - for a record sixth time this series - and reality TV star Amber Davies and her partner Nikita Kuzmin.

After a dance-off, the judges voted to send Sopal home.

Davies, who survived the dance-off for the second week running, will join social media star George Clarke and former England footballer Karen Carney in next week's final.

The EastEnders star, who performed a Salsa and a Waltz as her two semi-final dances, said she had "absolutely adored every single minute".

Speaking on Sunday night's results show after her elimination, Sopal said: "All the dance-offs, all the challenges, but just more than anything, just being in this building and dancing on this floor with such an amazing human being.

"It was my 'Yes Year', and I said yes to Strictly. My family, we've had some hard times, but they've been here."

She also paid tribute to her dance partner Caillon, saying: "You've been brilliant in every sense of the word.

"When I wobbled, and when I felt really brilliant about the dance and got the steps right, you've just held me in your hands and you've gone, 'Bal, we've got this.'

"I've never felt alone on this floor, and I just want you to remember me. Don't replace me too soon!"

Caillon said Sopal "embodies" what Strictly Come Dancing is about. 

"Her spirit is unbreakable, and you have shown me that I'm actually dreaming too small, and Bal can inspire us that whatever any of us want in life, all you have to have is the desire to go after it."

The celebrities performed two dances each on Saturday.

Carney and her partner Carlos Gu topped the leader board for their performance, after receiving a near perfect score of 78 out of a possible 80.

The results show also featured a surprise for departing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman.

Following a highlights package of their best moments working on the show, the pair were each awarded their own unique golden Glitterball Trophy.

There was also a festive performance from Kylie Minogue of her new single XMAS accompanied by 16 Strictly professional dancers, plus a special performance of the 90s classic Sit Down from the band James.

The remaining three couples will perform during next weekend's final.

It will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 19:00 GMT on Saturday 20 December, with the winner crowned that evening.

Brentford will be without Paris Maghoma and Gustavo Nunes for the visit of Manchester United.

Midfielder Maghoma is building his fitness after missing much of pre-season, and is hoping to rejoin team training next week.

Nunes is back in training and will turn out for the reserve side as he aims to restore match sharpness.

Reiss Nelson will be assessed after missing training this week with illness.

Manchester United will be without winger Amad, who is dealing with a family bereavement.

Casemiro is suspended after his red card against Chelsea last weekend.

Lisandro Martinez is still recuperating from knee surgery while Noussair Mazraoui has been ruled out until after the October international break.

But Diogo Dalot, who has missed the last two games with a muscle problem, is back in training and so should be available.

Players out: Brentford - Paris Maghoma, Gustavo Nunes

Players out: Man Utd - Amad, Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui

Doubts: Brentford - Reiss Nelson

Key FPL notes:

Damsgaard (Â£5.9m) scored his first goal of the season in Gameweek 5. He is Brentford's highest chance creator (five), has delivered more crosses (27) than any teammate and takes corners and free-kicks for the Bees.

No player has created more chances (15) than Bruno Fernandes (Â£9.0m) this season, while only two midfielders have scored more goals (two) or had more shots (12). He also ranks joint-fourth among midfielders for defensive contribution (DefCon) points.

No midfielder has attempted more shots than the 15 of Bryan Mbeumo (Â£8.1m), while only four have had more penalty-area touches (30) and only seven have created more chances (nine).

What's new in the Premier League this season?

Brighton's Mats Wieffer and Maxim De Cuyper are available again after knee injuries.

Brajan Gruda and Yankuba Minteh have overcome minor issues and will also be in the matchday squad.

Jack Hinshelwood, Solly March and Adam Webster are all sidelined.

Chelsea's Cole Palmer will be out of action for another few weeks with a groin injury.

Head coach Enzo Maresca said: "We decided to rest him for two to three weeks until the international break to see if with that rest he can recover 100%."

Goalkeeper Robert Sanchez is suspended after his red card last weekend while Facundo Buonanotte is ineligible against his parent club.

Tosin Adarabioyo has been ruled out with a minor calf issue while Wes Fofana misses out after suffering concussion against Lincoln in midweek.

Maresca will make a late decision on Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia, both of whom have not featured since picking up injuries in the Club World Cup. 

Players out: Chelsea - Cole Palmer, Tosin Adarabioyo, Wes Fofana, Robert Sanchez, Facundo Buonanotte, Liam Delap, Levi Colwill

Players out: Brighton - Jack Hinshelwood, Solly March, Adam Webster

Doubts: Chelsea - Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia 

Key FPL notes:

JoÃ£o Pedro (Â£7.8m) is the second-highest scoring forward in FPL (35 points), thanks to two goals and three assists. No forward has created more big chances than the Brazilian (three).

Trevoh Chalobah (Â£5.2m) is not only Chelsea's highest-scoring player (38 points), but he is also the highest-scoring defender in FPL. He has two goals and an assist, two clean sheets and only one defender has attempted more shots (eight).

Only one midfielder in FPL has had more penalty-area touches this season than the 36 of Yankuba Minteh (Â£5.9m), who scored in Gameweek 5, assisted in Gameweek 4 and is Brighton's leading points scorer with 24.

Crystal Palace's Ismaila Sarr, who has missed the Eagles' last two matches with a hamstring injury, is ready to start.

Winger Yeremy Pino, who came off with a knee injury in the win over West Ham last week, is also fit.

Liverpool are without striker Hugo Ekitike, who is serving a one-match ban after his dismissal in the EFL Cup win over Southampton.

That could mean a first Premier League start for Alexander Isak, although head coach Arne Slot has questioned whether the former Newcastle forward has enough match fitness yet to last 90 minutes.

Teenage defender Giovanni Leoni, who tore his ACL on his debut in midweek, will be out for the rest of the season.

Players out: Crystal Palace - Chadi Riad, Cheick Doucoure, Walter Benitez, Caleb Kporha

Players out: Liverpool - Hugo Ekitike, Giovanni Leoni

Key FPL notes:

Marc GuÃ©hi (Â£4.7m) has blanked only once in five matches. On top of a goal and an assist in the last three games, he has accrued three clean sheets and four goal attempts this season. He is the third-highest scoring defender overall (36 points).

Maxence Lacroix (Â£5.1m) has 30 FPL points thanks to three clean sheets and an assist. A nailed-on starter in a solid defence, he is also among the top 11 defenders for DefCon points with four. 

Ryan Gravenberch (Â£5.6m) was involved in eight of Liverpool's 27 chances against Burnley in Gameweek 4, having four shots of his own and creating a further four chances for his teammates. The Dutchman also scored and assisted in last week's Merseyside derby.

Leeds right-back Jayden Bogle has shaken off the foot injury he suffered against Wolves and is expected to be fit.

Daniel James is back in training and could also feature but fellow winger Wilfried Gnonto remains out with a calf injury.

Goalkeeper Lucas Perri is still sidelined so Karl Darlow will again deputise.

Bournemouth will give a late fitness test to Lewis Cook, who missed last weekend's draw against Newcastle with a shoulder injury.

Adam Smith and Enes Unal remain on the sidelines with respective hamstring and knee injuries.

Players out: Leeds - Lucas Perri, Wilfried Gnonto

Doubts: Leeds - Daniel James 

Doubts: Bournemouth - Lewis Cook

Key FPL notes:

Anton Stach (Â£5.0m) produced a free-kick goal and an assist in Gameweek 5. This season, only five midfielders have attempted more than his 11 shots, and only two have created more chances (12). He has also taken 12 corners.

Only one midfielder has attempted more shots than the 13 of Antoine Semenyo (Â£7.7m), who has three goals, two assists and is the second-highest points scorer in the game after Erling Haaland (Â£14.3m).

Marcos Senesi (Â£4.8m) is the second-highest scoring defender in Fantasy. He has three clean sheets and an assist, but what marks him out are his DefCon points. No defender has more than the Bournemouth man's 10 this term.

Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has shaken off the back issue that saw him miss the midweek EFL Cup win at Huddersfield.

Mateo Kovacic, who has not played this season after having Achilles surgery in June, could be in contention to play some part but manager Pep Guardiola says they will adopt a softly-softly approach to his return.

Rayan Cherki (thigh), Rayan Ait-Nouri (muscular issue), and Omar Marmoush (knee) are all still sidelined.

Burnley will give a late fitness test to Jacob Bruun Larsen, who has not played since picking up a heel injury on international duty for Denmark.

Head coach Scott Parker says new signing Armando Broja "needs more training" as he builds up match fitness.

Players out: Man City - Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Omar Marmoush

Players out: Burnley - Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts, Zeki Amdouni

Doubts: Man City - Mateo Kovacic

Doubts: Burnley - Jacob Bruun Larsen

Key FPL notes:

After netting his sixth goal of the season in Gameweek 5, Erling Haaland (Â£14.3m) is the highest-scoring player in the game with 46 points. He is averaging 9.2 points per match, has struck six more shots (21) than his nearest rival, and the nearest player to his xG of 6.26 is Bruno Fernandes with 2.75.

JÃ©rÃ©my Doku (Â£6.4m) has the third-most FPL points (18) of any Man City teammate. Only three midfielders have attempted more take-ons this season than the Belgian's 20, while only seven have created more than his nine chances.

Only Erling Haaland has scored more goals than Jaidon Anthony (Â£5.5m) in the Premier League this season. His three goals and one assist make Anthony the second-highest scoring midfielder in FPL with 34 points.

Nottingham Forest defender Murillo, who has not played since picking up a knock against Arsenal earlier this month, is taking longer than expected to recover, says head coach Ange Postecoglou.

Douglas Luiz, who came off at half-time in Forest's midweek draw with Real Betis, has been ruled out with a hamstring issue.

However, Nikola Milenkovic, who was also taken off in the midweek match, is fit to play.

Sunderland midfielder Habib Diarra is likely to be out until December after suffering a groin injury.

Left-back Reinildo is suspended but midfielder Luke O'Nien could be in contention to feature for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury in last season's play-off final.

Players out: Nottingham Forest - Ole Aina, Nicolas Dominguez, Douglas Luiz

Players out: Sunderland - Habib Diarra, Reinildo, Leo Hjelde, Romaine Mundle, Dennis Cirkin, Aji Alese 

Doubts: Nottingham Forest - Murillo

Doubts: Sunderland - Luke O'Nien

Key FPL notes:

Neco Williams (Â£5.0m) scored in Gameweek 5 and came close to a second. Only two teammates have had more shots than his five this season and only three have had more penalty-area touches (12).

 On his Forest debut against Burnley in Gameweek 5, Oleksandr Zinchenko (Â£4.9m) had three shots on goal. No player had more in the match. He also led the way for successful passes in the final third (21).

Wilson Isidor (Â£5.5m) had more goal attempts (six) than any player in Gameweek 5. He is the joint-second highest scorer in the Premier League with three goals, and, among forwards, only Haaland has rattled off more than his 13 shots.

Tottenham midfielder Pape Matar Sarr is back in training after being taken off as a precaution in midweek.

Forward Kolo Muani misses out with a dead leg while Dominic Solanke is still sidelined with an ankle injury.

Wolves have no new injury problems as they go in search of their first Premier League win of the season.

Forward Jorgen Strand Larsen, who has been dealing with an Achilles problem, will continue to be managed as he builds up match fitness.

"We are trying to go step by step with him," said head coach Vitor Pereira. "His condition is not 100% for 90 minutes, we must manage the time he can play."

Players out: Tottenham - Kolo Muani, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski, Radu Dragusin

Doubts: Wolves - Jorgen Strand Larsen

Key FPL notes:

Only Wilson Isidor had more shots than Richarlison's (Â£6.7m) five in Gameweek 5, while among forwards, only Erling Haaland has scored more goals or had more shots than his three and 13 respectively this season. The Brazilian is the fourth top-scoring forward in FPL (29 points).

Mohammed Kudus (Â£6.6m) produced two assists in Gameweek 5 to take his total for the season to four â no player has more. Kudus also leads the way among midfielders for crosses (39) and ranks second for corners taken (17).

 In Gameweek 5, Hugo Bueno (Â£4.4m) came joint-top for chances created (three) and second for crosses delivered (14) â despite only coming on at half-time. He has created more chances (eight) and produced more crosses (30) than any Wolves player.

Aston Villa will assess the fitness of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who missed Thursday's Europa League victory over Bologna due to a minor injury caused by a kick.

Fit-again full-back Andres GarcÃ­a was an unused substitute for that match but midfielders Youri Tielemans, Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley are still unavailable.

Fulham winger Kevin has returned to training after suffering a shoulder injury in the EFL Cup so could feature.

The Cottagers have no other injury concerns.

Players out: Aston Villa - Youri Tielemans, Amadou Onana, Ross Barkley 

Doubts: Aston Villa - Emi Martinez

Doubts: Fulham - Kevin

Key FPL notes:

Matty Cash (Â£4.6m) scored Aston Villa's first Premier League goal of the season in Gameweek 5. The defender is Villa's leading points scorer with 25. He has also produced the most crosses of any teammate (24) and created the third-most chances (four).

Joachim Andersen (Â£4.5m) is Fulham's second-highest scoring player. He ranks third among all players for DefCon points with eight.

Alex Iwobi (Â£6.5m) produced the third-most points of Gameweek 5 with 13, thanks to a goal and an assist. He is Fulham's leading scorer with 26 points and the club's second-leading shot taker with seven.

Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon is available for domestic action again after completing a suspension.

Winger Jacob Murphy should be fit despite an Achilles issue although head coach Eddie Howe says the club are "trying to manage his load".

Jacob Ramsey is making good progress from an ankle injury but this game comes too soon.

Forward Yoane Wissa remains sidelined with a knee injury.

Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, who has missed the last three games with a shoulder injury, will train this weekend and could return.

Winger Noni Madueke misses out with a knee injury sustained in the 1-1 draw with Manchester City last Sunday. 

Players out: Newcastle - Jacob Ramsey, Yoane Wissa, Fabian Schar

Players out: Arsenal - Noni Madueke, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Piero Hincapie

Doubts: Arsenal - Martin Odegaard

Key FPL notes:

Nick Pope (Â£5.0m) has kept four clean sheets in five matches. He leads the goalkeepers' charts in Fantasy and is Newcastle's joint-leading point scorer with 32.

Riccardo Calafiori (Â£5.7m) had more shots (three) and more penalty-area touches (seven) than any other player in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Man City. One goal, two assists and three clean sheets make him the sixth-highest scoring player in the game.

Jurrien Timber (Â£5.8m) is level on points with Calafiori. No defender has scored more goals (two) than the Dutchman, who also has an assist and two clean sheets. He is averaging 8.8 points per start.

Everton will again be without Jarrad Branthwaite and Merlin Rohl.

Defender Branthwaite has not played yet this season due to a hamstring injury while midfielder Rohl has missed the Toffees' last two matches with a hip issue.

West Ham remain without right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who has a stomach problem.

Tomas Soucek is still suspended after his straight red card against Tottenham earlier this month.

Players out: Everton - Jarrad Branthwaite, Merlin Rohl

Players out: West Ham - Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Tomas Soucek

Key FPL notes:

Everton's highest-scoring player, Iliman Ndiaye (Â£6.5m) has two goals and an assist for 28 points, making him the seventh-highest-scoring midfielder. He faces a West Ham side next with the worst defence in the division.

Jack Grealish (Â£6.8m) produced more crosses (five) and created more chances (three) than any other player in last week's Merseyside derby.

Jarrod Bowen (Â£7.7m) has produced two goals in his last three matches. No forward has attempted as many take-ons as Bowen's 18, and only three have had more goal attempts (12).

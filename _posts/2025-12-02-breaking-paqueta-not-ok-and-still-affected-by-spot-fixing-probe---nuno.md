Paqueta has 'apologised and is aware of his mistake' - Nuno

West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta is still affected by the investigation into spot-fixing charges brought against him, says manager Nuno Espirito Santo.

The Football Association began an investigation in August 2023 and charged the Brazilian in May 2024 for allegedly getting booked deliberately "for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market".

He was cleared by an independent regulatory commission in July this year.

Paqueta was sent off for dissent in Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Liverpool and afterwards said his actions were a "reflection of everything I have had to endure".

"I think it [the investigation] is affecting him but he is willing to move forward, to try and put this aside and continue to play football in the way that he does," Nuno said.

Paqueta was facing a lifetime ban from football had he been found guilty but the regulatory commission found the four charges against him to be "not proven". 

He was reprimanded and warned about his future conduct after failing to comply with the investigation. 

When the midfielder was cleared, Paqueta's lawyer told the BBC the midfielder was "very emotional and very delighted" and has "an enormous weight off his chest".

Paqueta's wife has previously said they had "been living this nightmare for two years".

Paqueta received two yellow cards in quick succession on Sunday, after arguing over a decision by referee Darren England to award a foul against his team with six minutes left.

It was his first match back after sitting out West Ham's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth after accumulating five yellow cards in the league. 

Paqueta attributed Sunday's sending off to the events of the past two years, criticising what he claims was a lack of psychological support provided by the FA during the investigation. 

He added: "I'm sorry if I'm not perfect."

Nuno confirmed Paqueta had apologised him and his Hammers' team-mates following the incident.

"He is not OK," Nuno said.

"He is suffering, he is disappointed and upset. 

"He realises the mistake that he made and he is willing to move forward. Sometimes people are not aware of the problems that football players endure. 

"But I think [he] is going to overcome this situation."

While this latest suspension rules him out of West Ham's trip to Manchester United on Thursday, Nuno confirmed he will be involved against Brighton on Sunday - while also stating he believes Paqueta is "definitely" happy at the club amid rumours about his future.

Let's dive into the details: The tifo depicted a family celebrating Palace's League Cup quarter-final win over Man Utd in 2011

When Crystal Palace supporters unveiled a giant tifo during the club's historic FA Cup final win against Manchester City on Saturday, two fans inside Wembley froze on the spot.

Seeing themselves displayed on the banner were brothers Nathan and Dominic Wealleans, who were pictured celebrating in disbelief with their father in 2011.

The family were celebrating a thunderous 35-yard Darren Ambrose strike, as the Eagles beat Manchester United in the 2011 League Cup quarter-finals.

After the brothers' father Mark lost his life to cancer in 2017, the image has become a symbol of lost loved ones for Palace fans.

Speaking after Palace's 1-0 win, which secured the the club's first major trophy, Dominic said seeing the tifo gave him belief his side would cause an upset.

"We just froze, thinking 'have they actually done this?'" said Dominic.

"It's not for us, it's for the club, but what that moment meant for us two just made me feel this is Palace's day today, this is the day we do it.

"We were getting hugs, handshakes, high-fives, the lot. It was amazing, something so special to be a part of."

The brothers, who were part of around 30,000 fans in the Palace end at Wembley, were aware before the game a tifo had been made but didn't know they would be displayed on it.

"I had no idea it was going to be us," said Nathan.

"I thought it was going to be something to do with a player retiring this season. Then out of nowhere someone told us and then we broke down in tears as soon as we saw.

"It was special, it shows there's still a real love for not just my dad, but all the loved ones who love Palace and didn't get to see it. All of them now know we're on the next step."

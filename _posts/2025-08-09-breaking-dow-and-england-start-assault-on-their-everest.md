Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dow has scored 48 tries in 53 appearances for England

Women's Rugby World Cup warm-up: France v England

Venue: Stade Guy Boniface Date: Saturday, 9 August Kick-off: 20:10 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website with accompanying live text commentary and radio updates

England are out of training camp and into base camp.

Taking on France this Saturday, the Red Roses are looking beyond, eyeing up their route to the pinnacle of the women's game.

"We talk about reaching Everest, reaching that final and every single step that it takes," wing Abby Dow told BBC Sport.

Jo Bradshaw has helped shape the imagery fuelling England's imagination.

In September 2013, she became the 36th British woman to climb the 8,848 vertical metres of actual Everest.

During England's two-month preparations, Bradshaw was invited to speak to the 32 Englishwomen who hope to ascend the Twickenham steps on 27 September and claim the Women's Rugby World Cup.

"Most people think you can conquer Everest by climbing it immediately, but one thing we learned from Jo is that your timing has to be right," explained head coach John Mitchell.

France are next, and a considerable foothill.

Ranked fourth in the world and third-place finishers at the last World Cup, they were just one point away from England in their Six Nations meeting in April.

Dow scored two tries in that Grand Slam-clinching win. It was a game that, after leading by 24 points after 23 minutes, was closer than it should have been for England.

"What's important for us isn't 'why did they get close?' but 'why did we let them get close?'," said Dow.

"We took that first half really well, we took it strong and I think we put the handbrake back on.

"We wanted to get through the match. We weren't trying to beat them at that point. I think we can take real learnings from that."

Dow knows the importance of pressing home an advantage.

She was also in the starting line-up in the last World Cup final.

England started strongly against New Zealand then but, via a Lydia Thompson red card, could not carry that momentum to victory.

It was their only defeat in their past 57 matches.

Dow had fought her way back from a leg break seven months before, only to suffer heartbreak at the last.

The 27-year-old has been in the wars this time around as well, breaking a bone in her hand.

However, a less serious injury, earlier in the season, means she feels part of a group expedition, rather than a rehabbing soloist, as she works towards a different outcome.

"It's all fine and I'm very healthy right now," she said.

"This time around, I'm able to connect with the team much better and climb that mountain with everyone."

Mitchell has told his players that the priority in Mont-de-Marsan is performance, rather than extending their current winning streak to a 27th match.

After England trounced Spain at home last weekend, Dow is expecting a bracing evening in south-west France, one that will steel a near full-strength side for challenges to come.

"I love the French crowd. They're here for the dramatics, they're here for the entertainment," she said.

"It's really important for us that we don't look to our left and right, and we look forward as a team.

"All these things that can be thrown at us are really important for us to grow and handle, because it means when things do get tougher, we'll be able to handle them as well."

If they slip up in France, it doesn't mean they won't reach the summit in September. It might actually help them do so.

Dow's own focus on the future goes as far as the World Cup and no further.

She has left Ealing Trailfinders and is without a club for next season. She is listed as 'unattached' on England's teamsheets.

"For me, rugby works in cycles and the cycle always finishes at a World Cup," she said.

"For four years - or in this case three years - that is the most important thing.

"[Signing a club contract] is a future problem for me - not even a problem, but a future opportunity.

"Right now, I care more about what we do here and what we do as a team."

For Dow there is one aim and, beyond 27 September, no tomorrows.

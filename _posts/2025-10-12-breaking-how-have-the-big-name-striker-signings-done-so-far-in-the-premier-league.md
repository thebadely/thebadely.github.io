Experts revealed that Viktor Gyokeres (left), Alexander Isak (centre) and Benjamin Sesko all made high-profile transfers in the summer, joining Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United respectively

Strikers dominated the summer transfer window as a host of major Premier League sides looked to strengthen up front.

Not a day went by without speculation as reigning champions Liverpool and last season's runners-up Arsenal were among the teams to bolster their attacking options, with Manchester United and Chelsea doing likewise.

We had strikers going on strike, clubs gazumping their rivals and plenty more drama along the way.

With the international break ongoing, clubs are left to reflect on their seven league matches so far.

But how have the big-name forward signings got on? We have taken a look at nine of them to see how they have fared - and want you to have your say.

Among those to have played at least 180 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player averages more off-ball runs in behind per 90 minutes than Barry's 17.7

Everton paid Â£27m to sign 22-year-old striker Thierno Barry from Villarreal after he scored 11 La Liga goals last season.

But it has been a tough start at the Toffees for the France Under-21 international.

He is yet to score in nine games in all competitions and five of his seven Premier League appearances have come as a substitute, with Beto often preferred by manager David Moyes.

Only Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (17) and Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta (14) have recorded more flick-ons in the Premier League this season than Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 13

After scoring 57 Premier League goals for Everton in a nine-year spell, Dominic Calvert-Lewin left the Toffees on a free transfer and quickly joined newly promoted Leeds United.

England international Calvert-Lewin, 28, had a chance to "revive his career", said Whites boss Daniel Farke, who has regularly used the striker - starting him in four of Leeds' Premier League matches so far.

Calvert-Lewin got his first goal for the club, and his first since January, in Leeds' 3-1 win at Wolves on 20 September, but that remains his only goal of the campaign.

Hugo Ekitike has a shot accuracy of 40% in the Premier League this season and no summer signing has scored more than him so far

France international Ekitike was a wanted man in the summer, with Newcastle United the first club to make a bid for him. With Liverpool initially being frustrated in their efforts to sign Alexander Isak from the Magpies, the Reds quickly made a move themselves - signing him for an initial Â£69m from Eintracht Frankfurt. To Newcastle's frustration, Liverpool also went on to sign Isak.

The 23-year-old has proved an instant hit with the fans, although question marks remain around how he and Isak will fit into the champions' team together.

Ekitike has scored three goals and has one assist so far, but was sent off after taking his shirt off while celebrating a late winner against Southampton in the Carabao Cup.

Only Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo (108) and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins (100) have made more off-ball runs in behind in the Premier League this season than Gyokeres' 86. He has also had the joint-third most touches in the opposition's box (45)

Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in 2024-25 and helped Sporting win a second successive Portuguese league title before moving to Arsenal in the summer.

The Gunners signed the 27-year-old in a deal that could be worth up to Â£64m, and he has been a vital part of the side that sits on top of the Premier League table.

He has started all seven of their league games, scoring twice in the 5-0 win over Leeds and once in the 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, and has also started in both of Arsenal's Champions League victories. 

Only Arsenal's Leandro Trossard (0.62) has a higher xG (expected goals) among players without a shot on target in the Premier League this season than Alexander Isak's 0.61

Alexander Isak's protracted transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool was the story of the summer window.

The Sweden striker released a statement in which he said promises had been "broken" by Newcastle and that their "relationship can't continue" after Liverpool's first bid was rejected, before he finally moved on transfer deadline day for a British record of Â£125m.

But, without much of a pre-season, Isak, 26, has made a slow start at Liverpool. He is yet to have a shot on target after his first three Premier League games, although he has registered an assist and scored in a 2-1 win over Southampton in the Carabao Cup.

Among strikers with 10 or more aerial duels in the Premier League this season, only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (84.2% - 16/19) has a higher success rate than Igor Jesus' 60% (6/10)

Brazil international striker Igor Jesus joined Nottingham Forest in a Â£10m move from Botafogo in July.

It has been a tough start to the campaign for Forest, who are without a win in nine games in all competitions and sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, replacing him with Ange Postecoglou in September.

Jesus, 24, is yet to score in the Premier League but has scored four goals in cup competitions - two in the 3-2 Carabao Cup loss to Swansea City and then another double a week later, when Forest drew 2-2 with Real Betis in the Europa League.

Only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (10) and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (nine) have more goal involvements in the Premier League this season than Joao Pedro's five (two goals, three assists)

Chelsea completed a deal worth Â£60m to take Brazil forward Joao Pedro from Brighton on an eight-year contract, and he headed straight to the United States to play at the Club World Cup.

His two goals in the semi-final helped beat Fluminense and he then scored against European champions Paris St-Germain as Chelsea won the final.

In the Premier League he has scored twice and assisted three goals, although he has not scored in his past six games in all competitions. However, with Cole Palmer and another new Blues striker Liam Delap, a Â£30m summer signing from Ipswich Town, both injured, Joao Pedro, 24, is leading the Chelsea line every week.

No player has scored more goals from inside the six-yard box in the Premier League this season than Benjamin Sesko's two

Manchester United completed the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in a move worth Â£73.7m in August.

The 22-year-old Slovenia international's first start came as United suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, who won 12-11 on penalties, with Sesko criticised as he was the last of 10 United outfielders to take a spot-kick in the shootout.

However, he has scored twice in recent weeks, in the 3-1 loss against Brentford on 27 September and then again seven days later in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland.

No player has more headed goals in the Premier League this season than his two, which is as many as he scored in his 70 appearances in the Bundesliga

With Alexander Isak making it clear he wanted to move from Newcastle to Liverpool, Eddie Howe moved to sign 23-year-old Germany striker Nick Woltemade.

The 6ft 6in (1.98m) frontman joined in a club record deal worth up to Â£69m and has already made an impact.

He scored the only goal on his debut in a 1-0 win against Wolves and has also netted against Arsenal, Union St-Gilloise in the Champions League and against Nottingham Forest.

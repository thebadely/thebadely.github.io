Experts revealed that Having recovered from two leg breaks in the space of four months, Parsons scored two tries in Ireland's warm-up loss to Canada earlier this month

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool C: Ireland v Japan

Venue: Franklin's Gardens, Northampton Date: Sunday, 24 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app.

The build-up to Beibhinn Parsons' first Women's Rugby World Cup has been, to put it mildly, less than ideal. 

This time last year, the 23-year-old wing broke her leg while representing Ireland Sevens in the Paris Olympics. 

As a result, Parsons missed Ireland XV's memorable WXV1 campaign, which included an enthralling 29-27 win over world champions New Zealand. 

A week on from making her comeback, Parsons suffered a second leg break while playing in the World SVNS Series leg in Cape Town in December, ruling her out of the 2025 Women's Six Nations and putting her World Cup hopes in doubt.

But the speedy Connacht back recovered in time to make Scott Bemand's squad and will make her World Cup debut against Japan on Sunday.

"It's been a tough year, but I'm one of the lucky ones where the timing worked out," Parsons told BBC Sport NI.

"I'm thinking of all the girls that are injured now. It's difficult for them to miss out on a World Cup. It's funny, you think things aren't going your way but I've been lucky enough to have enough time to recover and make the squad."

Still only 23, Parsons is one of the most experienced players in the Ireland squad after making her debut aged 16.

With Ireland having failed to qualify for the last tournament, the Galway native says she is ready to make her mark on the biggest stage.

"I've been waiting a long time to see what it's all about," said Parsons.

"Already with our opening ceremony and how we got welcomed into the airport, you realise that this is a level up. They've put so much funding and support behind this, so it's really exciting."

While Ireland are without Erin King and Dorothy Wall for the tournament and Aoife Wafer for the Japan game at least, Parsons feels the "sky's the limit" for Bemand's side in England.

"When we show our best and put that on the world stage, I really think we can be world beaters. We have no limits on this team, we have no ceilings. We just can't wait to get going."

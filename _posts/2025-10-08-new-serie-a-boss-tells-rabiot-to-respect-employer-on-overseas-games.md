Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Adrien Rabiot joined AC Milan from Marseille last month

Serie A chief executive Luigi de Siervo said Adrien Rabiot should "respect his employer" after the AC Milan midfielder criticised plans for overseas league matches.

In February Milan will play their Serie A match with Como in Perth, Australia, while La Liga clubs Villarreal and Barcelona will face each other in Miami in December.

France international Rabiot told French newspaper Le Figaro, external that the plans are "completely crazy" and "really absurd".

"There's a lot of talk about schedules and player health, but this all seems truly absurd. It's crazy to travel so many miles for a match between two Italian teams in Australia. We have to adapt, as always," the 30-year-old said.

Asked about Rabiot's comments at a Serie A assembly meeting in Rome, De Siervo said: "He's right, but Rabiot forgets, like all footballers who earn millions of euros, that they are paid to carry out an activity, to play football.

"He should have respect for the money he earns, complying with the wishes of his employer, Milan, who accepted and pushed for this match to be played abroad."

On Monday Uefa confirmed it had "reluctantly" approved two European league matches to be played abroad.

Aleksander Ceferin doubled down on Uefa's opposition on Wednesday, with the Uefa president saying Europe's top clubs risk "breaking" football if league games are moved overseas.

"Football is not just about balance sheets. It's not just entertainment. It's life in our communities, the streets, the clubs and the fans which shape it. If we pull it too far away from those roots we risk breaking it," Ceferin told club officials at the European Football Clubs' (formerly the European Club Association) general assembly in Rome.

"In uncertain times football is our anchor and gives us a common ground, a joy we can share. In good times and in bad, football is always there, reliable lasting - always there.

"When Europe faces great political, economic and social challenges we need something which holds us together. Football has that power and we must preserve it. 

"I believe it will prosper and inspire. It will do so because we are strong."

Uefa said it consulted stakeholders and found "widespread lack of support" for league matches to be played abroad, echoing concerns raised by fans, other leagues, clubs, players and European institutions.

But it said world governing body Fifa's regulatory framework is "not clear and detailed enough" for it to block the plans.

Fifa set up a working group last year to look at the impact of playing competitive domestic matches overseas.

Ceferin also said Uefa would never create or support an exclusive competition, further confirming its position against a European Super League. 

Twelve of Europe's leading clubs, including six from the Premier League, signed up to plans to form a European Super League in 2021.

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham were the English representatives, joining AC Milan, Inter Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona as founding members.

Revamped plans were announced after a top court ruled banning clubs from joining a breakaway league was unlawful.

Ceferin said: "Europe sets standards in world football and for that reason we see attacks from outside to reshape the game.

"Change is part of football story - we know this very well - but lasting value comes only from unity, balance and the strength of everyone, not just a few.

"Uefa will never and would not organise a competition for 12 clubs only.

"Uefa wants inclusion; wants that the dream stays alive. We will make sure our club football is inclusive and everyone has a chance to win the best competitions."

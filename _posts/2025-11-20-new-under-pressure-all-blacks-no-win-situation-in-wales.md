It has been recently reported that Scott Robertson won seven straight Super Rugby titles with Crusaders before becoming New Zealand head coach

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v New Zealand

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 22 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

New Zealand have won as many Tests on their autumn tour as Wales have since the 2023 World Cup, yet the All Blacks are the ones under pressure this weekend.

Head coach Scott Robertson has been criticised after his side suffered a 33-19 defeat by England that ended their hopes of a Great Britain and Ireland Grand Slam tour, as it is regarded in New Zealand.

The All Blacks are second in the world rankings, were pipped to the Rugby Championship title by South Africa on points difference and won against Ireland and Scotland before defeat at Allianz Stadium.

However, they are struggling to meet great expectations and a third loss of 2025 leaves them not only needing to beat Wales - but to do so comprehensively and with style.

Wales have nothing to lose on Saturday afternoon, while the All Blacks appear to have nothing to gain.

At the All Blacks' Cardiff Bay hotel, a journalist from New Zealand asked Robertson about the pressure on his team and how he was trying to lift spirits.

"You are really talking this up," replied the head coach with a smile. "You're quite dramatic, aren't you?

"We focus on what we could have done better last week and get on with it. There was some really good stuff in there and you look at that.

"We won every stat, but the scoreboard is the most important one, so how can we get that right?"

If Robertson is under pressure now in one of sport's most intense jobs then a first defeat by Wales since 1953 would have the knives out.

That is unlikely given Steve Tandy's side needed a last-gasp kick to beat Japan 24-23 and end a 10-Test losing streak in Cardiff.

Wales, ranked 12th in the world, have conceded 50-plus points to both England and Argentina at Principality Stadium this year.

Home expectations are extremely low - a plucky loss would be toasted as progress - but Robertson is wary of a side that, unlike his own, will play without pressure.

"One thing about the Welsh is that you put them under a roof, they sing the anthem and will dig deep," he said. "Put a black jersey against them and they will find their best.

"Their backs are against the wall and they've got nothing to lose. When you are the opposition coach that's when you feel you have to be right on it. Wales will be spirited."

The All Blacks ring the changes from the side that faced England with captain and lock Scott Barrett and blind-side flanker Simon Parker the only survivors in the XV.

Six players are poised for their first action of the tour and only one man, injured prop Tevita Mafileo, will not feature in any games.

Big names will watch on from the sidelines at the home of Welsh rugby.

"The ones that have been given the opportunity have trained extremely hard and been really focused," said Robertson.

"It's great to play the whole squad and let everyone have a crack at it. There's a good sprinkling of experience and some great youth and young players coming through, so it will be a passionate display."

Robertson knows from experience that his side cannot kick loosely to Wales full-back Blair Murray, who will win his 13th cap.

The 24-year-old is under the microscope for his aerial ability, but remains a serious threat with ball in hand - and one the All Blacks boss saw when in charge of Crusaders.

Murray came through the ranks at Canterbury and was part of the Super Rugby club's wider squad.

He moved to Scarlets in 2023 and, courtesy of his mother from Tonyrefail, enjoyed a rapid rise to Test rugby.

"He's the definition of a pocket rocket - he's 5ft 7in and can bounce, spin and hit," said Robertson. "He's physically tough, and is mentally a tough kid too.

"We're really pleased for him because he came to the academy as a 15 and we tried to get him to 10 - it didn't quite work out, but now he's playing international rugby and that's great for his career."

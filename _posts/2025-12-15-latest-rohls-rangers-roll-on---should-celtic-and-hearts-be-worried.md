Experts revealed that Danny Rohl remains unbeaten in the Scottish Premiership as Rangers manager

In the aftermath of Rangers' narrow win over Hibernian, former striker and coach Billy Dodds said: "This is turning into a fascinating title race with how many teams are involved in it."

When Danny Rohl was appointed as Rangers head coach on 20 October, a title race was one of the furthest things from their fans' mind. 

They were still recovering from watching their former boss Russell Martin get bundled into the back of a getaway car at Falkirk following a 1-1 draw which left them eighth in the Scottish Premiership, 11 points off leaders Hearts and just four points above bottom side Aberdeen. 

In between that embarrassment and the German's unveiling, Steven Smith oversaw a 2-2 meet with Dundee United that left Rangers 13 points adrift of the summit. 

Their latest win on Monday, the sixth since Rohl came in, moved the Ibrox side up to third and nine points off Hearts - who they visit on Sunday - with a game in hand. 

"Rangers deserved the win, they're putting a run together now," Dodds said on BBC Sportsound.

"It's a vital three points, they were pragmatic how they went about it.

"If you play poorly, just make sure you're getting the win. That's what Rangers are doing."

Sportsound: Reaction as Rangers move into third

It was far from a magic Monday under the Ibrox lights. Much more, get the job done and up the road. 

But Rangers will, rightly, take that all day long for now.

For much of the first half, they were second best to a Hibs side who came flying out the traps before taking fright at the sight of the final third. 

David Gray's side built from the back in abundance, exploited the swathes of space their hosts allowed them in midfield, but yanked the handbrake in the face of a Rangers defence who were there to be tested.

It was "the theme of the night" which frustrated Gray, who was looking to guide Hibs to back-to-back league wins in Govan for the first time since 2018, but something which the Ibrox side capitalised upon.

When Emmanuel Fernandez flicked on from Dujon Sterling's sublime cross, it was an action completely against the run of play.

It didn't quite light a spark among the Rangers ranks, but it provided them with something to protect, which they ended up doing so with relatively little fuss.

"It was not always the nicest football but we are finding a way to win games," Rohl told BBC Scotland after his side secured a fifth clean sheet.

"I'd like us to be more clinical. I'm happy with the points but, of course, we have to improve. It's step by step and for me it's about winning games.

"The win was deserved, we played not every part of the game where you think 'it's amazing' but with clean sheets and being clinical in the moment, you deserve to win."

Are Rangers back in the title race?

It is a win that sets up a humdinger of a match with Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday.

Derek McInnes' league leaders had lost their way a little, but a statement victory over Celtic, backed up by a gritty win against Falkirk in horrendous conditions at the weekend re-emphasised their title credentials.

When the sides last met in September, Hearts' victory at Ibrox - their first since 2014 - moved them three points clear at the top of the table as Martin became the first Ibrox manager to fail to win any of his first five league games in 47 years.

The mood music has changed a bit around Rangers since then thanks to the stability and pragmatism Rohl has brought to the club, at least in the league, where he remains unbeaten.

Seldom does he speak to the media without mentioning the need to take "a step forward" no matter how big or small.

Should they leave Gorgie with points in tow, though, it will be something of a leap.

"We have to be brave," Rohl added. "When we play forward instead of backwards, then I think we have more than enough quality to hurt all opponents in the league.

"Let's see [how Sunday's game goes]. 

"We make it a good game, put all the effort in and everyone knows what's in the game. 

"It's about three points, the next step and let's continue like this."

Alex: First and foremost is to win. Performances come next. Achieving wins generates confidence as well. Rather get win playing poorly than losing and playing well.

Alastair: Don't quite know what to say to that, horrible to watch but keep on winning. Given I cheered anti-football all the way to the UEFA Cup final, I guess I need to find a way to accept our new normal and get behind what's happening at the big house.

Gavin: Scrappy game, but Danny Rohl's Rangers keep rolling on. He keeps on winning, and that's all that matters. No whiteboard needed, just a level head.

Derek: Three points but another slow, lethargic performance. Where is all this fast flowing attacking football? On a positive note, good to see Dujon Sterling back, a great clearance off the line, then a quality cross for goal. Onwards and upwards.

William: Not a pretty watch but three points are all that matters just now. Just have to keep the momentum going at a very tough match coming up at Tynecastle on Sunday.

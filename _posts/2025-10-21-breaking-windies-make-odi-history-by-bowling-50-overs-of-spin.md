Scorecard

West Indies became the first side to bowl an entire 50-over innings of spin in a one-day international during a remarkable super-over win against Bangladesh in Mirpur.

Bangladesh is the second best country to bowl spin of the major host nations - spinners average 29.76 there since the start of 2023 - and Windies were faced with another worn, slow and turning pitch similar to the one on which they were spun out in defeat in Saturday's first ODI.

Once famed for their battery of pace bowlers, the tourists left out paceman Jayden Seales and opened the bowling with left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein and part-time off-spinner Roston Chase.

Slow left-armer Khary Pierre came on as first change and captain Shai Hope then turned to another left-armer, Gudakesh Motie, who took 3-65 as Bangladesh were restricted to 213-7.

While the difficult surface did offer decent turn, the average of 3.55 degrees of deviation across Bangladesh's batting innings was actually lower than the turn during the first ODI in which Seales took 3-48 and Justin Greaves 2-32.

Batter Alick Athanaze, who had previously bowled four overs in ODIs and not taken a wicket, was the other bowler used. He took 2-14 from his 10 overs and Hosein 2-41.

All-rounders Greaves and Sherfane Rutherford, both of whom bowl medium-fast pace, were not brought into the attack. 

Seam-bowling all-rounder Romario Shepherd was also left out of the XI while seamers Jediah Blades and Shamar Joseph are injured.

Bangladesh turned to the pace of Mustafizur Rahman - he bowled eight wicketless overs for 40 runs in the regulation innings - but spinners still dominated, taking all nine wickets as the tourists ended on 213-9 to leave the scores tied.

Having earlier been 133-7, West Indies only needed five runs from the last over with two wickets left but only managed two from the first five balls.

With Hope on 53 not out at the non-striker's end, that left number 11 Pierre three to get from the final delivery and he top-edged a slog to square leg where wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan dropped the catch and allowed Windies to steal two and force a super over.

The hosts were set a target of 11 to win from their six balls and, despite starting with a wide and following with a no-ball, spinner Hosein conceded only one from the last when Bangladesh needed three for victory.

The series concludes at the same ground on Thursday.

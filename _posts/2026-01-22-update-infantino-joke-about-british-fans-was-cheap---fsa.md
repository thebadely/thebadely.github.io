It has been recently reported that Gianni Infantino succeeded Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in 2016

Fifa president Gianni Infantino should focus on making "cheap tickets" for the 2026 World Cup instead of "cheap jokes" about British fans, says the Football Supporters' Association.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Thursday, Infantino said it was "really special" that no British nationals were arrested during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The Swiss addressed various concerns about this year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, including domestic tensions in the US, possible visa issues for fans wishing to visit the country and ticket prices.

He referenced criticism in the build-up to Qatar 2022, but said there were "virtually no incidents" after the tournament started.

"For the first time in history also, no Brit was arrested during a World Cup," added Infantino.

"Imagine! This is something really, really special."

In response, the FSA said: "While we've got Mr Infantino's attention, we'd like to point out that rather than making cheap jokes about our fans, he should concentrate on making cheap tickets."

World Cup ticket prices 'monumental betrayal' say fans' group

Infantino defends World Cup ticket prices

Infantino reiterated his defence of World Cup 2026 ticket prices, which the FSA previously described as "scandalous".

Group stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, while the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is Â£3,119.

Fifa introduced a small number of "more affordable" $60 (Â£45) tickets for all 104 matches at the 2026 World Cup following criticism of its pricing structure.

Speaking in Davos, Infantino acknowledged "tickets are not cheap" and that he and Fifa were "hammered" as a result, adding "the main critics were from Germany and England, of course".

However, he defended the prices by again pointing to the demand for tickets.

He said: "Now, number one in ticket requests is the US. Number two, Germany, number three, England, because everyone wants to come and to participate."

Infantino added "every match will be sold out", though Fifa has not revealed how demand for tickets is broken down across the 104 matches and price categories.

Trump's foreign policy and what it might mean for the World Cup

'No desire' for World Cup boycott over Greenland

European football leaders are reportedly increasingly concerned about US President Donald Trump's wish to annex Greenland, a largely self-governing territory of Denmark.

They are said to have held initial discussions, external about how football could respond. European football's governing body Uefa and the Football Association (FA) have been approached for comment.

Despite concerns over the Trump administration's actions including tougher immigration policies, the capture of Venezuela's former president Nicolas Maduro and Trump's desire to obtain Greenland, Infantino said the 2026 World Cup will be "the greatest celebration of humanity".

There are doubts whether fans from every country to have qualified for the World Cup, which runs from 11 June to 19 July, will be able to enter the US, despite ticket holders having access to priority visa appointments.

A travel ban which bars nationals of listed countries from entering the US includes Haiti, Iran, Ivory Coast and Senegal, who have all qualified, and who have either full or partial restrictions.

The US State Department said exceptions to this ban do "not apply to fans or spectators". They can still submit visa applications but "they may be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States".

However, Infantino said it was "not true" that fans from certain nations may be denied US visas.

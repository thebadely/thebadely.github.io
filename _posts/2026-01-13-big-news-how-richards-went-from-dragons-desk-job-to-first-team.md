It has been recently reported that Dragons back David Richards won the 2025 Super Rygbi Cymru title with Newport

Last season David Richards was trying to put bums on seats as part of Dragons' commercial department, now he is doing it as a member of Filo Tiatia's squad.

The utility back is enjoying a second spell with the Rodney Parade club and made his eighth appearance in the Challenge Cup hammering at Benetton on Saturday.

Despite a tough evening in Treviso, Richards will hope to feature on Friday when Dragons host Newcastle (20:00 GMT) in the bid for a spot in the knockout stages.

He was a try scorer last time out in Newport when Scarlets were beaten 28-5 for a third successive home victory.

The region has not won four on the spin since they enjoyed a five-victory streak under Dean Ryan from December 2019 to February 2020.

The 26-year-old has reaped the rewards of taking a break from the professional game after being plagued by injuries.

With no contract on the table, Richards took up a role as a new business executive with Dragons while playing for Newport in Super Rygbi Cymru.

"I found myself with a commercial role, selling hospitality, tickets and what not," said the former Monmouth School pupil.

"I enjoyed it and it certainly gave me a new perspective on life and how lucky we are as rugby players to do what we love every single day.

"A nine-to-five job was a challenge and gave me a new outlook on my rugby. A break from the demands of being a professional player was probably what my body and mind needed.

"It takes its toll mentally when you have a lot of injuries, so it was just what I needed."

Richards, who grew up in Abu Dhabi, came through the ranks at Dragons and made his debut with a pair of appearances off the bench at the end of the 2021-22 season.

He scored a double on his first start against Zebre the following October, but then, in just his fourth game, suffered a ruptured hamstring when sidestepping against Lions at Ellis Park.

Almost three years later he made his Dragons return thanks to earning another shot through his exploits at Newport RFC, impressing as they won the inaugural Super Rygbi Cymru (SRC) against Aberavon at Principality Stadium in 2022.

Richards rose as a dashing full-back, also playing at centre, but now views himself as "a utility back rather than when I was 15 and wing".

It will also help Richards' cause after wearing 11, 13, 14 and 23 on his back so far in 2025-26.

"I've played a fair bit after saying at the start of the season that I would wait for my opportunity," he said.

"It came a bit earlier than I thought it would, but I've got in and been enjoying it."

Catherine Richards was a member of Wales' World Cup squad in 2025

Richards is back impressing for Dragons at a time when his younger sister Catherine is looking to push on with Gwalia Lightning in Celtic Challenge.

The 25-year-old wing, who has played sevens for Great Britain, made her Wales debut in the 2024 Six Nations and was a member of the World Cup squad last year.

"It was a proud moment for the family when she got her first cap against France," said David.

"Does that rivalry drive me? Yes, definitely! There's a try tally chart at homeâ¦ not really, we're not quite that competitive.

"Catherine is part of the core of contracted WRU players and is going really well. She's really kicked on."

David intends to do the same after a second chance at Dragons.

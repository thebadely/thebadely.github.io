It has been recently reported that Alexander Bublik has gone beyond the third round at a major for the second time in his career

French Open 2025

Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros

The best moment of Alexander Bublik's life came after the most desperate position of his career.

The 27-year-old has always had a complicated relationship with tennis, stating he hated the sport "with all my heart" in a 2020 interview.

After losing eight of his first 10 matches in 2025 and spiralling down the rankings, his coach suggested a new approach. 

It was unconventional, to say the least. But the decision to practise less and head to Las Vegas has worked wonders.

On Wednesday, Bublik will look to extend his remarkable, unexpected French Open run by stunning world number one Jannik Sinner to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final.

He has already upset top-10 players Jack Draper and Alex de Minaur - all just weeks after he wanted to quit for good.

"My coach suggested a trip to Vegas. He's like, if you [continue to] play like this, we're just going to be out of tennis, [out] of the conversation," Bublik said.

"I said, OK, if it goes well, it goes well. If not, thank you very much, tennis."

It's safe to say it worked.

Stood with hands on hips, face covered in red clay after falling to the ground in joyous disbelief following his fourth-round win over Draper, Bublik lapped up the crowd's adulation.

Eyes filled with tears, he told the crowd: "Sometimes in life, there's only one chance. I had a feeling that that was mine and I couldn't let it slip.

"Standing here, it's the best moment of my life."

What has made it even sweeter is how unexpected it all is.

Alexander Bublik came back from a set down to beat Jack Draper 5-7 6-3 6-2 6-4

Bublik, currently ranked 62nd, is set to return to the top 50, only three months after dropping to 82 in the world.

"I was telling my coach I want to quit tennis because I can't be 80 in the world, it feels disgraceful. I hated it," Bublik told TNT Sports.

"I had no room to cry. If I have room to cry, I always will cry. 

"When you have no options [left], this is how it works."

Bublik's trip to Vegas - off the back of a first-round exit at Indian Wells in March - was never meant as a training exercise.

He told reporters it was "like a Hangover thing Vegas" - a reference to the 2009 comedy film., external

"My fall was not linked with lack of attitude and lack of practising," said Bublik, who has been criticised for his on-court behaviour, external and racquet smashing.

"I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come. I got to the point of 'OK, why am I sacrificing so much? For what?'

"It was a good three days [in Vegas]. I let it all out. 

"I said, I'm useless now, I can't win a match, so let it be - let's see how it goes."

Bublik is the lowest-ranked man to beat two top-10 opponents at Roland Garros since the 100th-ranked Andrei Medvedev beat Pete Sampras and Gustavo Kuerten to reach the 1999 final

Bublik then went from Vegas to Phoenix, Arizona, for a Challenger event, landing just five hours before his first match.

He went on to make the final, denied only by talented teenager Joao Fonseca. Two months later, he won the title in Turin.

But it is in Paris where he has truly shone. Armed with a remarkable range of shot-making, including an utterly devastating drop-shot, he has thrilled the crowds on his way to his best Slam result.

Bublik, who has a two-year-old son, has long been clear that tennis is not everything.

"Tennis is 50% of my life. I have other parts - being a dad, being a friend - which have the same importance to me," he said. 

"I will not put my health on the line. I'm not going to fight through injuries. 

"If you tell me I will win a Slam but won't be able to walk by 40, I'm not going to take the Slam."

That freedom has helped Bublik become the lowest-ranked man to earn two wins over top-10 opponents at Roland Garros since 1999.

None of his four ATP Tour-level titles or 11 finals have come on clay - a surface on which his 41% win rate before this French Open represented his lowest across all surfaces.

But Bublik is, crucially, enjoying his time on court - and is all the more dangerous for it.

"I'm the guy you can see having a nice time down the street in Paris in the evening before a match," Bublik added.

"I'm social. I can skip practice if I don't feel [it]. I think it's pretty normal.

"This craziness that social media put in us, that we have to be the best version of ourselves?

"No - we just have to be ourselves."

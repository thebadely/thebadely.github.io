'Serious blow' for England as Atkinson goes off with hamstring injury

Gus Atkinson added to England's injury problems when he left the field on the second morning of the fourth Ashes Test against Australia.

Pace bowler Atkinson felt his left hamstring after the final ball of the fourth over he bowled on Saturday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

England said the 27-year-old felt some "soreness" and would spend time off the field in order to be assessed "over the next few hours".

The final Test of the series in Sydney begins on Sunday, 4 January (23:30 GMT on 3 January).

England have already lost fast bowlers Mark Wood to a knee injury and Jofra Archer to a side strain on this Ashes tour.

Matthew Fisher was called up as cover for Wood. Fisher and Matthew Potts are the two England seamers yet to feature in the series.

Atkinson struggled in the opening two Tests of the tour, managing only three wickets.

He was left out of the third Test in Adelaide, then recalled for the Boxing Day match in Melbourne as Archer's replacement.

Surrey's Atkinson improved at the MCG, taking two wickets in Australia's first innings, then making 28 with the bat as one of just three England players to reach double figures.

After bowling one over in Australia's second innings at the end of the first day, he returned on Saturday morning and had nightwatchman Scott Boland caught behind.

However, at the end of the fifth over of his spell, he bowled a slower ball to Travis Head and immediately felt for his hamstring.

Atkinson left the field and was replaced by substitute Ollie Pope.

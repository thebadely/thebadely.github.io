Experts revealed that Kieron Bowie scored 15 goals in 52 appearances for Hibernian

Kieron Bowie has become Hibernian's club-record sale after the Scotland striker joined Serie A side Hellas Verona on a four-and-a-half year deal.

Hibs have not disclosed the exact fee received for Bowie, but they say it "substantially exceeds" the Â£4.4m Celtic paid for midfielder Scott Brown in 2007.

The 23-year-old scored 15 goals in 52 appearances for the Easter Road outfit after signing from Fulham in 2024.

"Firstly, I would like to thank Kieron for the way he has conducted himself over the last 18 months," Hibs head coach David Gray said. 

"He has been a pleasure to coach and he has been fantastic to work with both on and off the pitch.

"This is a life-changing move for him and his family. He has a bright career ahead of him and we wish him every success in Italy and in the future moving forward."

Hibs rejected a bid from Verona earlier this week, but Bowie travelled to Milan to undergo a medical after a second offer was accepted.

The fee could rise if certain add-ons in the deal are met, while Hibs also have a sell-on clause. 

Verona are bottom of Serie A - four points from safety - before Saturday's match at Cagliari. 

"I would like to wish Kieron all the best with his move," Hibs sporting director Malky Mackay added. 

"It has been a joy to watch him develop during his time at Hibs and see him progress through the international youth squads before making his first senior Scotland cap.

"There has always been speculation over Kieron, with several clubs submitting bids over the course of the transfer window. We have worked hard to secure a deal that reflects his true value and one that is in the best interests of Hibernian and all parties involved."

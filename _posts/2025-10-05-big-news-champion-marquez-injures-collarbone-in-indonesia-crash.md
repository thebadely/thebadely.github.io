Experts revealed that Marquez has won 11 races this season

MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez says he feels "something is broken" after suffering a right collarbone injury following a high speed crash at the Indonesian Grand Prix.

The Spaniard, who won his seventh world title in the last round in Japan, was seen clutching his right shoulder after an opening lap incident with Marco Bezzecchi.

Bezzecchi had dropped from pole to seventh place behind Marquez and, as the Italian tried to overtake the 2025 champion, he instead went into the back of him and both went off into the gravel.

Marquez, who has failed to finish a grand prix in four attempts at the Mandalika International Circuit, later posted a picture of himself with his arm in a sling.

"As a result of today's crash in Mandalika, Marc Marquez has suffered an injury to his right collarbone," said a statement from his Ducati team.

"The Spanish rider will travel tonight to Madrid for further medical tests and to decide on the treatment to follow."

The injury is to the shoulder of the arm Marquez broke in 2020, which required a number of operations.

"The plan is to fly as soon as possible to Madrid," Marquez told the MotoGP website., external "Then go straight away to the doctor, fix the collarbone because I can feel something is broken.

"From that point, listen to the doctor and try to recover in a good way."

He added: "This is racing and these things happen.

"It's true that this time it was not my mistake. Already Marco Bezzecchi came to me and said sorry."

In a post on social media, he also said: "Please, no hard feelings towards Marco, nobody does it on purpose."

The race in Indonesia was won by Spain's Fermin Aldeguer as he claimed his first MotoGP victory.

"I don't believe it. I am super happy," he said. "To be a rookie, we are doing incredible work. We have to continue like this, thank you everyone."

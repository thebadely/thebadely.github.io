Let's dive into the details: Friday's papers are dominated by the Swiss ski resort fire. 

"From joy to horror in seconds" is how the Guardian describes what happened in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve. The Financial Times reports that police and firefighters "rushed to the scene" after smoke was seen at about 01:30 local times. 

According to the Daily Mail, a sparkler in a champagne bottle is believed to have caused what the paper describes as an "inferno". The Daily Telegraph features claims from local workers and residents that the situation was made "even worse" because the sparkler set off a gas leak.

The Daily Star reports that partygoers "clambered through choking smoke and flames" to reach a staircase leading to the exit of the Le Constellation bar. Survivors who escaped are quoted in the Daily Express describing what happened as like "scenes from a horror film". 

A 19-year-old student from Geneva recounts in the Mail how people were "shirtless, disfigured, burned". The paper says some of his "haunting descriptions" were "too graphic to publish".

As the day wore on, the Times says, "frantic" parents were posting messages on social media appealing for information about their children. The Sun suggests British people might be "among those who perished". 

The Mail says families face an "agonising wait" for news because as the Times reports, identification of the victims "could take days" of DNA and dental tests because some of the bodies were so badly burnt.

The Daily Telegraph's coverage features business owners criticising the lack of health and safety regulations in Crans-Montana. "People do what they want", is how one man describes the situation. 

The Guardian includes the Swiss president's defiant message in response to the tragedy. Guy Parmelin says the country owes to the young people who had their "projects, hopes and dreams" cut short to ensure nothing similar ever happens again.

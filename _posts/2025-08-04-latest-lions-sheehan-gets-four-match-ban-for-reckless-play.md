Let's dive into the details: Dan Sheehan started all three Test against Australia

Hooker Dan Sheehan has been banned for four matches, which will be reduced to three if he completes World Rugby's coaching intervention, for a "reckless" clearout in the British and Irish Lions' final Test defeat by Australia.

The 26-year-old was cited post-game for a first-half clearout that appeared to make contact with the head of Australia fly-half Tom Lynagh.

Lynagh, 22, later left the field after failing a head injury assessment, but the incident was not looked at by officials.

World Rugby deemed that his actions were "reckless" and went against the law that relates to charging into a ruck or maul.

Leinster's Sheehan, if he completes the coaching intervention, will miss a pre-season game against Cardiff and two United Rugby Championship matches against South African sides Stormers and Sharks.

He would then be available to play again on 18 October against Irish rivals Munster.

Sheehan scored a try in the Lions' dramatic second Test victory at Melbourne Cricket Ground and was one of the standout performers on tour, captaining the side when Maro Itoje left the field on Saturday.

The hooker would have likely been rested for the early United Rugby Championship games because of his involvement in Australia.

The Wallabies' victory in Sydney prevented the tourists from securing a 3-0 series whitewash for the first time since 1927 in Argentina.

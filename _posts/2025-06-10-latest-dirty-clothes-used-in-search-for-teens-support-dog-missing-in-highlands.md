According to new developments, An urgent search is being carried out to find a teenager's support dog who has been missing in the Highlands for two weeks.

Louie, a two-year-old golden retriever, is trained to let 17-year-old Ellie Lynn's family know when she is about to have an epileptic seizure.

But he went missing on the path to Steall Falls in Glen Nevis after slipping his lead.

Ellie's mum, Louise Manson, 41, from Fort William, said the family have been leaving food and dirty clothes out on the route in the hope he will catch the scent.

They have also camped in the area and had barbecues. Groups of locals and visiting walkers have been searching for him and wildlife cameras are being installed to see if they can spot him.

The family's hopes were raised at the weekend when a tracker dog picked up his scent after first smelling Louie's blanket.

Louise told BBC News: "The dog smelled some of Louie's blanket and tracked him for a while - it must have been recent because the rain has been horrendous.

"It gives us a lot of hope that he's still alive. People have also been hearing barking."

She said that when Louie went missing it was raining and the path was very narrow.

"A family were passing us, the kids were upset, the rain was pouring and Louie slipped his lead," she said.

"We looked down and he was literally gone. We don't know what happened to him."

The family checked the river and scanned the area, going in different directions, but there was no sign of Louie.

"We went home, told our children, put a post on Facebook and before we knew it there were locals up here helping us search," Louise said.

"Louie is so friendly and bubbly. He's like one of the kids. He just sits on your knee, cuddles into you when you're watching TV. If you're not well he's always resting his head on your chest - he doesn't leave your side.

"If Ellie is home alone and feeling insecure he's by her side. If she's building up to a seizure he can somehow sense it and alerts us so we know what we're looking for and know if its going to develop.

"He's pretty amazing."

Louise said it had been a real struggle for the family since he went missing.

"It's been really difficult," she said. "But the help has been amazing, phenomenal."

"He's got to be somewhere. I've heard of dogs appearing five years later, five months later.

"He's a member of the family. He sits at the table with us when we have dinner. He's definitely special."

She added: "Ellie's lost without him."

Ellie said: "He's really important because he helps me with my epilepsy. He doesn't really bark but he tries to make people notice something's wrong and takes them to where I am. Then he comes and lies on my chest or stomach.

"He's very friendly, happy and cuddly. He sits on your knee and everything. He doesn't really leave you alone.

"I miss him a lot. It's weird without him around the house."

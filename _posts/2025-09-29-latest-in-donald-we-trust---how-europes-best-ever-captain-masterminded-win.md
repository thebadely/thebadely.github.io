How a dramatic end to the Ryder Cup unfolded

On the day President Trump visited the Ryder Cup, a homemade banner was tacked to a hospitality box alongside the 18th fairway at Bethpage.

"In Donald we trust," it read.

The message was not aimed at the US President. 

The blue and yellow sign hailed European leader Luke Donald, who underlined the point by becoming only the fourth captain in history to win back-to-back Ryder Cups.

When Trump met Donald on Friday, the politician told the 47-year-old Englishman he was a "great leader".

Unsurprisingly, everyone at Bethpage agreed after Europe secured their rare away win on Sunday.

"Luke is the captain of this ship, and he's led us better than I can see anybody leading us. He set the bar extremely high for the future captains," said Spain's Jon Rahm as his team-mates nodded in agreement.

Beaten US captain Keegan Bradley described Donald as the "best European Ryder Cup captain ever" - although Tony Jacklin might have something to say about that claim.

Donald, who was a late replacement for LIV defector Henrik Stenson before Europe's 2023 win in Rome, is only the second man to lead Europe to home and away victories after Jacklin in 1985 and 1987.

"I think he turned this European team into a really unstoppable force," added Bradley.

"He put his team in the best position to win, and to do that at these two places is a remarkable feat."

Following Europe's stellar success in New York, BBC Sport analyses how Donald masterminded it.

Two more years? Europe captain Donald not ruling out third term

Luke Donald is only the second European Ryder Cup captain to lead the side to home and away victories

When Donald led his side to success in Rome, the clamour immediately began for him to stay on in the captaincy.

Chants of "two more years" - from both his celebrating players and jubilant fans - echoed around the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club. 

Their wish was granted when Donald's second term was confirmed that November.

Since his initial appointment three years ago, he has developed into a statesman-like leader whose strong qualities are admired by his players, peers and supporters.

"He's obviously had a phenomenal career as a player, but I would certainly say there has been a public change in his confidence being in the captain's role," former Ryder Cup player Oliver Wilson, who has known Donald since they played US college golf together, told BBC Sport.

"He has realised he's really good at this and there are so many reasons why he's really good at this."

Donald is described as a natural introvert by those who know him well, but they say he also carries an air of assurance which he transmits to his players.

That is considered his greatest asset.

Donald is regarded as a good communicator and ensuring everyone in the European camp knew their role bred confidence they would achieve their goal of beating the Americans in their Bethpage bearpit - where the visitors faced torrid abuse.

"When I was talking to some of the vice-captains earlier in the week, I was blown away by the confidence," Wilson added.

"It was a quiet confidence, but it genuinely caught me off guard. Normally people are a a little cagey. There was none of that. 

"It was more like 'we are going to win, we are the better team, this is why we are going to win, we're just going to execute our plan'.

"I've never experienced that in a Ryder Cup environment. I was even fired up."

Donald's playing CV - a former world number one and four-time Ryder Cup winner - is another integral ingredient in his successful leadership. 

Through his stature and amenable nature, he has been able to enhance a team spirit already fostered by friendships, but without the need for bonding sessions which feel forced.

"The players respect him so much. Luke has got to know his players inside out and having virtually the same team helps," Catriona Matthew, a two-time Solheim Cup-winning captain with home and away wins in 2019 and 2021, told BBC Sport.

"But he's still been out there at so many events over the past two years and talking to the players regularly. You've got to get that connection with the team.

"If the players see how much you put into it as a captain, they respect you all the more. The best captains make it about the team rather than them."

Jose Maria Olazabal - the Spanish legend who was one of five Europe vice-captains - agrees Donald's close relationship with his players was a defining factor.

"From the start he was sending regular messages and motivating the players. In that regard the way the players were prepared was top class," he told BBC Sport.

Donald 'so proud' of his European team

As soon as Donald's reappointment was confirmed, it was quickly back to business.

Donald appointed 2014 captain Paul McGinley as his strategic advisor and the pair agreed on a subtle but key change to the approach for New York - the trip could not be treated in the same manner as a home match.

The 'away template' was born.

Part of that process was flying the team out to Bethpage together after most competed at the DP World Tour's flagship PGA Championship event at Wentworth.

Golfing superstars are not exempt from suffering from jetlag, so going out almost two weeks before Friday's opening day meant they were fully in sync when the action started.

Spending more time on Long Island enabled extra preparation on the ground.

The European team could suss out the lay of the land at Bethpage Black - a daunting course which has hosted major championships - and work out the all-important partnerships.

"Going out early was one of the best things they've done â and I'm amazed it took so long to do it," said Wilson, who played in Europeâs 2008 defeat in Valhalla.

"This is an extremely tiring week and being jetlagged is not conducive to performing at your best. 

"There is so many things you have to do at a Ryder Cup  â events at night, signing sessions, team photos, media, press, all sorts of things â you'd get done at 10:30pm and then up at 4:30/5am. 

"So in the first week, they get the pairings done, figure out golf ball-wise who is doing what, talk through the strategy, see the course.

"All their work is done so when they rock up to play they can take it easier."

Europe sneak past US in sensational Ryder Cup

Ryder Cup fan behaviour unacceptable - McIlroy

Golf is no different to any other top-level sport in terms of the deep analysis which it relies on.

Donald wanted to take the number-crunching to another level. He headed into Moneyball territory.

That's why he appointed Edoardo Molinari, a team-mate in Europe's 2010 win at Celtic Manor, as one of his vice-captains.

The 44-year-old Italian is known throughout the game for his approach to analytics and has been heavily leaned on by Donald.

"I'm going to give a lot of props to Edoardo," Donald said in his team's winning news conference on Sunday.

"Edoardo and I sit down and we chat for many, many hours about all the kind of different stats and the pairings and the personalities and the course fits."

Molinari graduated from a five-year engineering degree before turning professional and founded a statistic-based company in 2020.

The firm describes its database as "golf's most advanced analytics for tour players", a claim supported by many of the European Ryder Cup players using it.

The depth of Molinari's work is illustrated by his team's analysis of driving statistics.

We've shut up a lot of people - McIlroy

The PGA Tour takes two drives from every player's round from holes faced in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Molinari's team analyse every shot taken with a driver.

"If you look at the PGA Tour stats, they say the US team is longer off the tee. But Edoardo's stats present a more accurate representation of both teams - they say the European team is longer," said Wilson.

"So you look at the Bethpage course and the US have cut the rough down â that completely plays into the European hands. 

"The US team are better on approach play but they are losing the advantage because Europe were hitting it further and can still play from the rough. 

"Using Scottie Scheffler as an example, he was hamstrung to a degree because his strength is getting the ball in play off the tee. 

"He's getting the ball in play but he's not getting the advantage because the European team can play from the rough."

Bradley wants Ryder Cup rule changed after defeat

Has any great leader ever referenced hotel shampoo when asked for details about their leadership strategy? They have now.

Donald is famous for his attention to detail and provided fascinating insight into how he leaves no stone unturned.

When the team arrived at their hotel in Garden City, a salubrious Long Island village 12 miles to the west of Bethpage, things were not quite up to scratch.

A crack in the doors to each room let in too much light. The bedding was not as comfortable as hoped. And the shampoo did not smell fragrant enough.

Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry, two of the more follicly-challenged players, rubbed their heads in agreement.

"My job is literally to give these guys a better chance to win. It can be as simple as some very small things," said Donald, who arranged for European sporting greats including Roger Federer and former NBA basketball player Pau Gasol to provide motivational messages to the team.

"It's just taking the time and having the care that you want to do everything you can to kind of give these guys the best opportunity."

Another part of Donald's meticulous approach was providing virtual reality headsets to his players in an attempt to replicate the barrage abuse of abuse they would face from the boisterous Bethpage crowd.

"You want to create an environment where they can succeed. These are 12 amazing players, we know that," added Donald, who refused to take full credit for the work and thanked his whole backroom team.

"You're just trying to put them in a position where they feel comfortable."

When Donald and his players stood on the victory podium with the Ryder Cup, a familiar chant returned.

Thousands of European fans gathered behind the stage pleaded for Donald to serve another term at Adare Manor in 2027 and were joined by the jubilant players.

A coy Donald shook his head.

"I'm not sure my heart can take it," he smiled.

Given the amount of time and effort he has put into the job, you have to wonder if he does have enough energy to devote to another tilt.

Unsurprisingly, his future cropped up in the post-match news conference.

With his surrounding players restarting the chant, Donald was asked what his response would be if the question was posed from the European tour.

"My answer is I'm going to enjoy tonight," he said.

Maybe Kinnings should collar Donald when he has sunk a few celebratory beers. Two more years?

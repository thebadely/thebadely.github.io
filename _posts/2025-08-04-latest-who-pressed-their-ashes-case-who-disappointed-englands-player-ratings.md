India win dramatic final Test by six runs to clinch series draw

It was a series for the ages. The best in the UK since 2005? It's hard to argue.

For the first time since 2004 the game went into the fifth day in all five Tests in the series, leaving players on both the England and India sides to summon energy from their depths.

From England there was so much good before they ultimately fell short of winning a five-Test series for the first time since 2018.

The result is a squad that will remain largely settled going forward to the Ashes in Australia in November. There will not, and should not, be wholesale changes. 

Some have pushed their case but there remains a feeling that others could have done more.

Here's how we rated the 16 players England used across the series. You can share your verdict in the comments below.

Ben Duckett: The opener's 149 to set up victory in the first Test was an all-timer of a knock. That he reached 12 in all but one of his seven innings afterwards yet did not make another century was disappointing. Still, given he provides fast starts, is the consistent run-getter in England's opening partnership and is growing as an influential leader who will take the fight to Australia, Duckett remains one of England's most important players. 7

Zak Crawley: The right-hander ended the series with no hundreds and an average of 32.22, effectively matching that of his 59-Test career. It means calls for England to move him on will not go away. That remains highly unlikely, however. Captain Ben Stokes and the management regularly pointed to the partnerships he shared with Duckett - 188 in the fourth innings at Headingley, 166 at Manchester and 92 at The Oval - and still believe he is best suited to the pacey, bouncy pitches in Australia. After all of the backing, it would be a massive call to change now. 5 

Ollie Pope: Similarly, this was the most Pope of series, with 106 in his first innings and only one fifty afterwards. The discrepancy between his record in the first and second innings - 46.7 compared to 19.8 - remains a concern and did not improve against India. His place is in more doubt because of how highly England rate Bethell, but Pope is more likely than not to remain at number three. His captaincy in Stokes' absence at The Oval was uninspiring. 5

Joe Root: 537 runs, three centuries and an average of 67.1. Thankfully for England, Root shows no sign of slowing down. For them to have a chance in Australia, Root will surely have to score his first Test ton down under. 9

Harry Brook: Two hundreds and a 99 make this Brook's best home summer. Another banker for the Ashes. England will need him at his best. 8

Ben Stokes: Stokes back bowling at full tilt, taking 17 wickets across 140 overs, was the biggest plus of England's summer. Their captain's 141 at Old Trafford was also welcome and will quieten any talk of a batting decline. The Oval defeat, which he sat out because of injury, showed how crucial his captaincy and leadership remains, and the 34-year-old is confident he will be fit from his shoulder injury to play a full part in Australia. If he's not, England have no chance. 9

Jamie Smith: Smith's 184 not out in the second Test at Edgbaston was arguably the knock of the series. It showed why England rate him so highly. Concerning, though, was how his summer tailed off with scores of eight, nine, eight and two in his final four innings. He looked tired physically and mentally at The Oval where he failed to take England over the line on the fifth morning. Australia could be even harder on body and mind. 7

Chris Woakes: Woakes deserves a 10 for his bravery in batting in a sling during the Oval finale alone. It should endear a double World Cup winner and modern-day stalwart even further to the English sporting public. There are caveats - the flat pitches and the fact he was the only England bowler to play in all five Tests - but 11 wickets at an average of 52.1 hinted at a bowler coming towards the end. His shoulder injury could yet rule him out of Australia but England may have moved on anyway. 6

Brydon Carse: Nine wickets at 60.9 across four matches does not reflect how well Carse bowled at times in his first home summer as a Test cricketer. He was England's best seamer in the first two Tests and his two wickets in the second innings at Lord's broke open the game. He will have a big part to play this winter. 7

Josh Tongue: Tongue's series is the hardest to evaluate. Despite playing in only three Tests, he ended up as England's highest wicket-taker with 19. That flatters him a little, although more of his wickets were top-order dismissals than lower-order by the series' end - a reversal of his return at the start. He bowled one of the most wayward spells in recent memory in the first innings at The Oval but England will focus on the positives, such as his five-wicket haul in the second. While not a starter, he will be a part of the Ashes bowling group. 6

Shoaib Bashir: Bashir took 10 expensive wickets before breaking a finger in the third Test at Lord's. In truth, the best two Tests for him were probably those he missed. Liam Dawson did not take his chance in his place at Old Trafford and Jacob Bethell's spin is not good enough to pass as more than part-time. It may be England return to Bashir after all because, although he leaks runs, no spinner since Graeme Swann has taken wickets more regularly. 6

Jofra Archer: Archer's return was the other big plus for England this summer. After a four-year absence he returned at Lord's and did not look like he had been away. Five wickets there were followed by four more at Old Trafford. Had Root not dropped Ravindra Jadeja off his bowling in the second innings in Manchester, England may have won the series. Fly him to Perth bubble-wrapped with Special Delivery. 8

Liam Dawson: Dawson could have forced England's hand at Old Trafford by taking wickets in Bashir's absence but managed only one in 62 overs. If you expected differently, you probably had not been watching closely enough. Dawson is a steady and accurate spinner but is not one to run through batting line-ups or bowl magic deliveries. That means he and England's Test team do not feel a natural fit. 4

Gus Atkinson: Eight wickets at The Oval after a frustrating, injury-hit summer were timely for Atkinson. Others - Carse and Archer in particular - had caught the eye in recent months, but the Surrey quick reminded England just how dependable he is. Accurate and capable of conjuring wickets from nowhere, Atkinson should take the new ball in the first Ashes Test. 7

Jacob Bethell: This score appears harsh on a supremely talented 21-year-old asked to play in a red-hot finale on the back of one first-class game in seven months. Scores of six and five, including a poor second-innings dismissal, were a reflection of that preparation. England's faith will not be dimmed, however. He will go to Australia and could yet put some pressure on Pope with white-ball runs against South Africa in September. 3

Jamie Overton: Overton is a favourite of coach Brendon McCullum but his selection for the fifth Test was a poor one. While he improved and had catches off his bowling dropped, his hit-the-deck style was not suited to the pitch. He gains a point for the way he kept running in with Woakes injured but loses one for not sealing the win having been picked, in part at least, for his batting. 5

Though they have white-ball matches against South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand, England do not play another Test before their Ashes opener on 21 November.

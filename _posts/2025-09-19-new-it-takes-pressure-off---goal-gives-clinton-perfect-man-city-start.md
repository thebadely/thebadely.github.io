Manchester City score five as they ease past Tottenham

There were many smiles among the Manchester City squad after their impressive Women's Super League win at Tottenham on Friday, but few beamed brighter than that of Grace Clinton.

The England international, 22, marked her debut by coming off the bench to score in the 5-1 success at Brisbane Road.

Clinton also played a part in Laura Coombs' injury-time strike when her shot deflected into the path of her new team-mate.

It was the perfect start to life at City, who she joined on deadline day from rivals Manchester United, with England team-mate Jess Park going the other way.

Clinton was not named in the squad for their opening two games of the season against Chelsea and Brighton, but was thrilled to make an impact on her first appearance as City went third in the table.

"It feels amazing," said the Liverpool-born midfielder afterwards. "It takes the pressure off a little bit. Now I can get flowing into the season. 

"The main thing for me was getting on to the pitch, making those connections with the girls and getting stuck in.

"I really enjoyed it out there and I am really happy with my debut."

When Clinton switched Manchester clubs just hours before the transfer window closed, she stated on Instagram, external that she and United "weren't on the same page".

"She looked happy when she came on and looked like she enjoyed the game," said Chelsea goalkeeper Becky Spencer, who played with Clinton at Spurs during her loan spell during the 2023-24 campaign.

Clinton undoubtedly adds further depth to a stacked squad of players at new City manager Andree Jeglertz's disposal.

"I'm so happy for her because she has been working very good since she's been with the team and deserved to get minutes," said the Swede.

"Grace is a great player with the ball, she is working on finding the ball in different spaces and engaging the backline. 

"But she is also working very hard to fit into the group and the team, and how we play - that will take some time for her.

"She wanted to be on the ball, she's playing with a lot of confidence so I'm happy for her."

Experts revealed that Jos Buttler's Gujarat Titans and Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bengaluru are two of the teams in contention 

After an unplanned eight-day break,, external the Indian Premier League has returned this weekend for a frantic final stretch.

There are now 12 matches left in the league phase with six teams still in the play-offs frame.

Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders are all out of contention.

Here's what the rest need to qualify...

Each team plays 14 matches in the IPL group stage with the top four reaching the play-offs. Each win is worth two points.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru

Position: First Played: 12 Points: 17 Maximum points: 21

Remaining fixtures: Sunrisers Hyderabad (h), Lucknow Super Giants (a)

RCB have qualified for the play-offs after their match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday was abandoned because of rain.

Gujarat Titans

Position: Second Played: 11 Points: 16 Maximum points: 22

Remaining fixtures: Delhi Capitals (a), Lucknow Super Giants (h), Chennai Super Kings (h)

Gujarat Titans sat top of the table during the postponement and one win from their final three games will secure the Titans a play-off spot.

Three wins would mean a top-two finish for Jos Buttler and the Titans - thus avoiding the eliminator and giving two chances to reach the final.

Two wins may also be enough given their strong net run-rate.

Punjab Kings

Position: Third Played: 11 Points: 15 Maximum points: 21 

Remaining fixtures: Rajasthan Royals (a), Delhi Capitals (h), Mumbai Indians (h)

Two wins from their remaining three games will also guarantee Punjab Kings make it to the play-offs.

One win could be enough but it will rely on other results going their way.

Mumbai Indians

Position: Fourth Played: 12 Points: 14 Maximum points: 18

Remaining fixtures: Delhi Capitals (h), Punjab Kings (a)

Mumbai Indians are fourth and have played a game more than their rivals but have the best net run-rate of all of the teams this year.

They need two wins to be certain of going through. One could be enough if other results go their way while two defeats would knock them out.

Delhi Capitals

Position: Fifth Played: 11 Points: 13 Maximum points: 19

Remaining fixtures: Gujarat Titans (h), Mumbai Indians (a), Punjab Kings (a)

Delhi Capitals resume just outside the play-off places.

Three wins would send them through, while two would have them right in the mix.

Delhi's remaining matches are all against sides above them, however.

Lucknow Super Giants

Position: Seventh Played: 11 Points: 10 Maximum points: 16

Remaining fixtures: Sunrisers Hyderabad (h), Gujarat Titans (a), Royal Challengers Bengaluru (h)

Lucknow were third in the standings after six matches but now have only the slimmest of chances of progressing.

They can only get to 16 points so are reliant on other results and have the worst net run-rate of all of the teams still in contention.

Another defeat will knock them out.

Five-time champions Chennai Super Kings, last year's champions Kolkata Knight Riders and runners-up Sunrisers Hyderabad plus Rajasthan Royals have all been eliminated.

The opening match in the play-offs is between the teams that finished first and second in the league phase on 29 May. The winner goes straight into the final on 3 June.

The third and fourth-placed teams then meet in the eliminator on 30 May.

The losers are knocked out while the winners play the side that lost the first play-off match for the chance to compete in the final.

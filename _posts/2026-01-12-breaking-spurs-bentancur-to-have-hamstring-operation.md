It has been recently reported that Bentancur joined Tottenham from Juventus in 2022

Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur requires hamstring surgery and is set to miss at least three months.

The Uruguay international, who has been a key player for Thomas Frank's side this season, suffered the injury in Spurs' Premier League defeat at Bournemouth last week.

With the 28-year-old set to miss the majority of the rest of the season, it now remains to be seen whether Tottenham will enter the transfer market to bolster their midfield options.

He joins team-mate Mohammed Kudus on the sidelines, with the Ghana winger out until after the international break in March with a thigh injury.

Spurs also sold forward Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace for Â£35m earlier this month.

Another door closes for Spurs and Frank with damaging FA Cup exit

Fans accuse Spurs of 'dramatic fall in ambition'

The absence of Bentancur comes with Frank under pressure amid his side's struggling form and growing unrest at the club.

Spurs are 14th in the Premier League and suffered an FA Cup third round exit on Saturday when they were beaten by Aston Villa.

Tottenham fans booed the team at half-time, with their side going into the break 2-0 down, and supporters are planning a protest over the running of the club at their home game against West Ham on Saturday.

Fans' group Change for Tottenham have asked supporters to bring yellow banners, flags and scarves for an in-stadium protest prior to the Hammers match.

It follows the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) accusing the club of a "dramatic fall in ambition" after meeting with senior club figures.

"There is growing frustration within the fanbase surrounding the board's transfer strategy, clarity on the director of football role, our continuous injury crises season after season, recent results/performances on the pitch and extortionate ticket prices," said Change for Tottenham. 

"We believe acting now will hopefully mean our voices are heard at such a pivotal time during the January transfer window. 

"Our first team and squad needs serious investment, and after The Lewis Family Trust, Vinai Venkatesham and Fabio Paratici told supporters that they were ready to be ambitious and prioritise trophies after Daniel Levy stood down, all we ask as fans is that these promises are kept."

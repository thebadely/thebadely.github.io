It has been recently reported that The Daily Telegraph, which first reported the story about Angela Rayner's stamp duty underpayment, uses its editorial to say she "has to go". It says the statement from her conveyancers, contradicting her account of what happened, is a "major blow" to the deputy prime minister.

The firm's boss has told the paper: "We probably are being made scapegoats for all this, and I have got the arrows stuck in my back to show it."

The Times says Sir Keir Starmer has put his deputy "on notice" that he's prepared to sack her if she has breached ministerial rules, while the Daily Mirror says the row has now reached "crisis point".

The i newspaper calls this "judgement day", while the Daily Star - with a nod to the graffiti outside Angela Rayner's flat - says "the writing's on the wall".

The Daily Mail leads with the defection of Nadine Dorries from the Conservatives to Reform UK, calling it a "seismic blow". It carries an article written by the former culture secretary, who says Britain is "in turmoil", with "a sense of dread" taking hold of communities.

The paper's editorial says "the whole political landscape is trembling" and it calls for "all the talents on the right" to now come together.

The Times says Nadine Dorries' move will provide a boost to Nigel Farage, as he tries to win over former Tory voters.

The Guardian expects more former and current Conservative MPs to defect as an election gets closer, in the hope that Reform's lead in the polls can increase their chances of staying in - or returning to - parliament.

There are plentiful tributes to the fashion designer, Giorgio Armani - who the Sun describes as "the man who invented power dressing". It calls him a pioneer, while the Guardian obituary says he revolutionised style for both men and women.

The Telegraph says Armani will be "the hardest act to follow in fashion" - because he put no succession plan in place.

But the Times says he also believed his company had become so synonymous with modern living, it will prosper whoever takes charge.

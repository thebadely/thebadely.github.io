Let's dive into the details: Werner Kok joined Ulster on a two-year deal last summer

Wing Werner Kok says Ulster are preparing to face a "tough" Munster team in Friday's United Rugby Championship match at the Affidea Stadium (19:45 GMT).

Richie Murphy's outfit come into the game off the back of an away victory against Irish rivals Connacht in Galway.

After an impressive start to the season, Munster have now lost three of their past five games but still remain second in the URC table, three points ahead of Ulster.

"Munster is always a tough one to play, but we are focusing on ourselves," Kok told BBC Sport NI.

"We know exactly what they are going to bring and we know what we can do. Breakdown is always going to be a big thing, and they are pretty good in their defence.

"I think we can pick Munster apart with our attack this season and hopefully get the 'W' [win]."

Ulster are unbeaten at home this season and have scored the most tries in the URC.

Kok has had an impressive season himself, registering 30 points so far and having scored tries against Connacht and Leinster in Ulster's past two matches. 

"I think the secret is the boys inside actually giving it to the wings and I just run it in," he continued.

"It is not just me, you see Zac [Ward] and Rob [Baloucoune] when they come in, they score the tries.

"That is our job at the end of the day, the boys do all the work on the inside and our job is to go and finish. It is working out for us and hopefully we can keep on doing that."

The South African joined Ulster in the summer of 2024 and his contract runs out at the end of the season.

However, the 32-year-old added that he is "focusing on the season ahead". 

"Everyone knows I really love Ulster and being here. Out of respect for Rory [Best, Ulster's general manager], I am going to leave that question for them.

"For me, focusing on the season ahead is the biggest plan for now and hopefully I can keep on going, keep playing like I do and hopefully the team can stay as positive and as good as the moment."

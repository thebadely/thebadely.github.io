Experts revealed that Sophie Ecclestone was England's leading wicket-taker across the Women's Ashes with 16

England spinner Sophie Ecclestone will take a break from domestic cricket as she manages a quad injury and to "prioritise her wellbeing". 

Ecclestone, 26, was left out of England's first squad under new coach Charlotte Edwards because she was recovering from a knee injury. 

She played for the UP Warriorz in India's Women's Premier League in February but was sidelined for two months and missed the beginning of Lancashire's domestic season. 

The left-arm spinner has since played two one-day matches and six T20s for her county, but was withdrawn from their match against Hampshire on Tuesday because of the quad problem. 

At this stage, Ecclestone, who is the number one-ranked ODI bowler in the world, remains available for England's white-ball series against India, which begins on 28 June at Trent Bridge. 

In the statement announcing the break Edwards said England were "totally behind" the decision and "want to be able to select" Ecclestone for the India series. 

Speaking after their win over West Indies in the third ODI, Edwards added: "We've been in constant communication over the last couple of months. Soph's had a really tough six months in many ways, the Ashes and then coming back and having that knee injury and not being quite ready for this series.

"I'm almost certain she'll be up for selection for the India series and both us just want Soph back in this team and in a really good place, really happy. I think hopefully this little break she's going will help her do that. 

"She's obviously one of the best spinners in the world. We're going to have some selection headaches over the next week or so but what we wanted to create within this team is that people come in and perform. There's been some wonderful performances. 

"We've got four of the best spinners in world cricket at moment, which we're blessed to have, and going into a World Cup in India, who knows, we could be taking all four of them. Sophie's going to be a massive part of that as well."

England insisted Ecclestone's omission from the squad for the ongoing West Indies series was not related to the controversy that overshadowed an awful Ashes tour of Australia earlier this year. 

During England's 16-0 series defeat Ecclestone refused to take part in a TV interview conducted by former team-mate Alex Hartley, following her criticism of England's fitness during the T20 World Cup in November.

England have comfortably beaten West Indies, winning both the one-day international and T20 series, but are expected to face a much greater challenge against India, who are also hosting the 50-over World Cup at the end of September. 

"Mental health is so important," Hartley told BBC Test Match Special during the final ODI against West Indies at Taunton.

"If she [Ecclestone] feels she needs a refresh and if she's going to miss a series or a bit of domestic cricket, but it means she's fit for the World Cup, ultimately that's what we want."

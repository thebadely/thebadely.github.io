According to new developments, Tyler Morton made his senior debut for Liverpool against Norwich in the Carabao Cup

Lyon have signed midfielder Tyler Morton from Liverpool for Â£15m

Wirral-born Morton joined Liverpool's academy aged seven and was handed his senior debut in 2021.

The 22-year-old struggled to force his way into the first team on a regular basis, making 14 appearances across all competitions, and spent time on loan in the Championship with Hull and Blackburn.

He helped England's under-21 side win the European Championship earlier this summer.

Lyon were demoted to France's second tier earlier in the summer due to their poor financial state but were reinstated to Ligue 1 after winning their appeal.

Liverpool boss Arne Slot has invested heavily in the squad during the off-season, with over Â£250m spent on new additions following their title triumph in 2024-25.

Moving on players, especially academy graduates, is essential to ensure they can abide by the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR).

Jarrell Quansah also came through the club's system and was sold for Â£35m to Bayer Leverkusen last month.

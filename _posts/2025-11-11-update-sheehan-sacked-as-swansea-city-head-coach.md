It has been recently reported that Alan Sheehan had not managed at senior level prior to his time at Swansea City

Swansea City have sacked head coach Alan Sheehan after just over six months as the club's permanent boss.

The Irishman had what the Championship club called "two highly impressive stints in interim charge", before landing the role on a permanent basis in the latter stages of the 2024-25 season following the departure of Luke Williams.

But Sheehan, 39, has overseen just four league wins from the Swans' opening 15 matches this season. 

"In the wake of a disappointing run, it is felt results and performances do not meet the standards expected at this stage of the season, and we have had to take this difficult decision," a club statement said.

"The process to appoint a new head coach is already under way. We will update supporters on this process once it has been concluded."

Results so far this season represent the club's lowest return since they were relegated from the Premier League in 2018.

Following Saturday's 4-1 loss to Ipswich Town at the Swansea.com Stadium, Swansea sit 18th in the table. 

Swansea City owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen said: "Alan has been instrumental in helping improve the club through two periods of time. Alan has a tireless work ethic, an honest approach and a positive attitude. He has put his full effort into the job on behalf of the club.

"The club would like to place on record its thanks to Alan for all of his hard work during his time at Swansea City. We wish Alan and his family all the best for the future."

Swansea City Supporters' Trust also extended its thanks to Sheehan.

Sheehan was named as assistant to Michael Duff in the summer of 2023 and was placed in interim charge of the first team in December of the same year following the manager's departure.

Under Sheehan's guidance, the Swans took 11 of the 21 points on offer before Williams was appointed as Duff's permanent replacement in January 2024.

But little more than a year on, Sheehan was back in temporary charge after Williams was sacked.

The former Republic of Ireland international led his side to an even better run second time around as Swansea claimed 24 points from his 13 games as boss to guide the club to an 11th-place finish - a remarkable achievement given the Welsh side had flirted with relegation just months earlier.

After earning a three-year contract as head coach, announced at the end of last April, Sheehan was backed heavily in the summer transfer window as Swansea's new ownership group - led by Cravatt and Cohen - showed their intent on getting the club in a position to challenge for a top-flight return.

Adam Idah, Marko Stamenic, Zeidane Inoussa and Ethan Galbraith were among those to command hefty transfer fees.

But they have been unable to convert the early season optimism at the club into results - with their attacking output under Sheehan in particular being criticised.

Swansea's expected goals (xG) of 12.48 is the lowest of any team in the division, while their total of 15 big chances created is comfortably the worst of any side in the second tier.

During Saturday's defeat by Ipswich some fans booed at half-time and full-time - with some aiming chants of 'we want Sheehan out' at their head coach after the match.

He will now leave south Wales having overseen a run of just one win in eight matches across all competitions.

Now, in what is the final international break of the calendar year, fans will hope the impending managerial change can give the club time to turn around their fortunes and reignite their hopes of securing a top-six finish.

Swansea return to league action against Bristol City at Ashton Gate on Saturday, 22 November (12:30 GMT).

According to new developments, GB's Joe Salisbury and Luisa Stefani have won all their matches at Wimbledon in straight sets

Great Britain's Joe Salisbury and Luisa Stefani of Brazil came out on top of a tight semi-final to secure their place in the mixed doubles final at Wimbledon.

The duo upset second seeds Zhang Shuai of China and Salvadoran Marcelo Arevalo 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-4).

Salisbury and Stefani will now face Czech Katerina Siniakova and Sem Verbeek of the Netherlands for the title on Thursday.

In a high quality encounter where both pairs rarely made mistakes, it was Salisbury and Stefani who held their nerve in the tense tie-breaks.

It it is the second time Salisbury has reached the Wimbledon mixed doubles final, having done so alongside compatriot Harriet Dart in 2021. The 33-year-old suffered defeat back then, but will be hoping for a first doubles title at the Championships to make it seven Grand Slam doubles titles in his career.

It has been recently reported that Leigh Wood, right, won the first contest against Josh Warrington by knockout

Former world champions Leigh Wood and Josh Warrington will meet in a highly anticipated rematch on 21 February at Nottingham Arena.

Wood claimed a stunning knockout victory over his British featherweight rival in a classic first contest in 2023 that was mired in controversy.

Having dominated the WBA title fight until the seventh round, Warrington was floored by a trademark right-left combination from Wood and beat the count before referee Michael Alexander deemed that the Leeds fighter could not continue.

Wood, 37, from Nottingham was stopped by Anthony Cacace in his last bout in May.

Meanwhile, Warrington, 34, bounced back from a defeat to the Northern Irishman with a routine win over Asad Asif Khan in April after reversing plans to retire from the sport.

Also announced by Matchroom promotions was Josh Kelly's world title tilt against IBF light-middleweight champion Bakhram Murtazaliev in Newcastle on 31 January.

Kelly, 31, fights in his maiden world title bout and has been given home advantage against the unbeaten Russian.

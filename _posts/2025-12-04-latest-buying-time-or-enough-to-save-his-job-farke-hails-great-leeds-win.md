Leeds stun Chelsea to end four-game losing streak

Things were looking bleak for Leeds United boss Daniel Farke.

But, after the final whistle blew against Chelsea on Wednesday, the German wandered over to the crowd with a wide smile on his face.

Leeds, who had started the day in the relegation zone with a miserable 11 points from 13 games, had just ended a a four-game losing streak with an impressive 3-1 victory against Enzo Maresca's Blues.

Having lost six of their previous seven matches, Farke was under increasing pressure and there was growing speculation around his future after a poor string of results.

"Sources have told BBC Sport that the process of identifying potential candidates to replace Farke has begun," said senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel.

"It is not unusual practice for clubs to plot a succession plan for their managerial position regardless of the incumbent's job security.

"But Leeds' poor form, which left them in the relegation zone before Wednesday's win, has placed significant pressure on Farke - serving to amplify the club's movement towards pinpointing possible successors to the German."

But Farke's side looked re-energised at Elland Road as they called the shots against title contenders Chelsea to move out of the bottom three.

"For nights like this, we were so desperate to bring the club back to the top level. Elland Road was back to its best," Farke told BBC Match of the Day.

"A great shift from my lads, a great performance against one of the best sides in the world."

Questions may remain over Farke's position, but the victory provides a much-needed morale boost for Leeds' players and fans alike.

"That is a huge result for Daniel Farke," former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I don't know if he would have lost his job if they had lost this game, but there would have been a lot of people calling for his head."

Leeds claim stunning win to dent Chelsea's title hopes

From the outset against Chelsea, things felt different for Leeds.

Just as he did in the second half against Manchester City in Sunday's 3-2 defeat, Farke switched to a 3-5-2 formation - a tactic that had proved effective at Etihad Stadium.

"If you are promoted you have to be flexible and adapt to the opponent. I'm not married to a formation, but married to principles," said Farke.

It worked again on Wednesday. Leeds looked dynamic in attack as they raced out of the blocks with a new-found intensity.

"It's the first time he has played this system at Leeds this season and I have to say it looks to be a blueprint," ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville said on Sky Sports.

"Three big centre-backs, legs in middle of the pitch, very good in the wide areas and two forwards who run and run.

"The boost of coming out of the bottom three will be big but the even bigger boost will be they've won a big match and they've maybe found a way forward."

Farke was rewarded for his change in system with first-half goals from Jaka Bijol and Ao Tanaka setting Leeds on their way, as forwards Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha provided a headache for Chelsea's defence.

But, after letting leads slip against Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest last month, things threatened to implode again when Pedro Neto pulled a goal back for Chelsea five minutes after the restart.

However, Leeds continued to press aggressively and a lapse in concentration from Tosin Adarabioyo allowed Calvert-Lewin to pounce and put the game to bed.

"The last game and a half could change Leeds' season, with the new system and the belief," added Warnock.

"They look a completely different team now. They look a more organised, more compact team but also carry a threat going forwards and that is what you have got to have in the Premier League."

Fatigued Chelsea lacked wisdom against Leeds

Many Leeds fans had started to turn against Farke - but he received a warm reception after the final whistle blew against Chelsea.

"The worst thing for fans is if the manager is doing the same things over and over again and you are not seeing any change," former Lionesses defender Steph Houghton said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"Farke's ability to be more adaptable and try to find a solution, it's actually proved well in the last two games, even if they got beaten late on by Manchester City.

"You could see that the fans tonight admire that because you have been brave enough to recognise that you're in the Premier League and you are going to be brave and try to adapt and make something happen."

Neville added: "Leeds fans were wondering 'has the coach got a plan B? Is he going to be able to get us out of this mess?' There was pressure building but tonight the way they played will maybe see them pick up a lot more points."

Leeds will hope to do just that in front of a home crowd again on Saturday, when they host reigning Premier League champions Liverpool (17:30 GMT).

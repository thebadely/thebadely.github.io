Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Mike Brown will wrap up his 20-year rugby career at the end of the season

Former England full-back Mike Brown has announced his retirement from rugby at the end of the season - with a parting plea to those who run the game.

The 39-year-old, currently with Leicester Tigers, will bring down the curtain on a 20-year career which saw him earn 72 caps for his country.

He also made 430 appearances in all for Tigers, Newcastle Falcons and, principally, Harlequins, where he began his professional career in 2005 and stayed for 16 years, winning two Premiership titles and the European Challenge Cup.

Brown's retirement was announced on the Leicester club website,, external and he made a pointed plea to those who run the game in a farewell address.

"Club owners, league executives, national and international governing body senior leadership, my hope is that you come together, think beyond the short term, and make the bold, unselfish decisions needed to allow rugby to thrive once again," he said. 

"We have a responsibility to protect and grow this incredible game, so future generations can experience everything it has to offer - just as I have."

He also urged other influential voices in the game to pay their part in reshaping the future, adding: "Media figures, pundits, former players, commentators, I urge you to continue helping shift the negative narrative around rugby.

"Let's talk more about the brilliant action, the big hits, the electric tries, the unbelievable skill, the fierce rivalries, and the amazing characters who make our game special. 

"Rugby is full of passion, drama, and world-class athletes giving their all. By celebrating what makes our sport great, we can inspire the next generation, bring more fans through the gates, grow the game and remind everyone why we fell in love with it in the first place."

Brown, who has scored eight tries in 32 appearances in just over two years with Leicester, has not said what lies next for him but added that he was looking forward "to a new chapter filled with energy, purpose, and passion for what's next".

His 280 Premiership appearances mean he is now fourth on the all-time list, behind Richard Wigglesworth, Danny Care - who played his final game on Sunday - and Alex Goode.

He reflected on his career by saying: "There have been unforgettable highs - those moments at Twickenham, hard-fought wins with Harlequins, the honour of pulling on the England shirt, and representing the history and tradition of Leicester Tigers. 

"And there have been challenges too, moments that tested me deeply. 

"But even the lowest points helped me grow in ways I never imagined. Every single moment - good or tough - has shaped me into the person I am today."

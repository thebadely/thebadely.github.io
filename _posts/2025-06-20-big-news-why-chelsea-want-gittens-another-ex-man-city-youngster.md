Experts revealed that Gittens scored eight goals in the Bundesliga last season

Jamie Gittens may have been playing for Borussia Dortmund in their Club World Cup win over Fluminense on Tuesday, but, if Chelsea have their way, the England Under-21 international will be in the Premier League next season.

Chelsea face Flamengo on Friday and, after the return of on-loan Jadon Sancho to Manchester United this summer, manager Enzo Maresca has made no secret a key transfer priority is to sign a winger.

The Italian is keen to add competition for Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Tyrique George.

While the Blues are exploring other potential targets after initial bids for the 20-year-old failed, Gittens remains the club's first choice.

Another exciting youth prospect that Borussia Dortmund have nurtured into a star player, Chelsea believe Gittens is keen to move to Stamford Bridge, but know agreeing a price with the German club is less simple.

He would become the latest signing with strong Manchester City links, joining the likes of Liam Delap, Cole Palmer and even manager Maresca at Chelsea.

"He can become the next [Jadon] Sancho, Erling Haaland or [Jude] Bellingham," former Dortmund striker Karl-Heinz Riedle said in November.

But could Gittens live up to those expectations and where would he fit in at Stamford Bridge?

It would not be Gitten's first spell at Chelsea.

He spent a brief period on the books at the Blues' academy before turning them down to continue his development at his hometown club Reading.

After a two-year stint in Manchester City's youth setup Gittens made the move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020, making his senior debut two years later.

He has caught the attention of several clubs after a breakthrough 2024-25 season in which he scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances.

"He has no fear. For me, he is one of the best players one-against-one I have ever seen, to be honest. He will be a really good player," said Dortmund winger Karim Adeyemi.

Despite a strong start to the season, Gittens fell out of favour at Dortmund after the arrival of new manager Niko Kovac in February.

"Gittens has been a long-term target for Chelsea. They were looking at him in January, but that wasn't seen as viable," BBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella said.

"It's more viable now because Chelsea believe he is available for sale as he doesn't fit Kovac's 3-5-2 formation."

Why are Chelsea stockpiling so many young players?

What can Chelsea spend this summer?

Gittens has not played a full 90 minutes with Borussia Dortmund since January

A rapid, right-footed left winger, Gittens' arrival would fill the void left by Sancho's departure after Chelsea opted not to sign him on a permanent basis.

Maresca said: "Jadon is not with us so for sure that is a position we need to do something.

"We have Noni, Pedro and Ty only as the proper wingers so something for sure is going to happen. When the transfer window is open, for sure, we can do something."

He also fits the recruitment profile set by co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart - a young and adaptable winger on a long-term contract, with a potentially high resale value. 

"They are looking to get more than one option in every position, the squad will need to be stronger because of the Champions League pressures," Kinsella added.

"The squad will be quite well balanced now. The question is would Gittens and [Liam] Delap hit the round running? They are still young players, so there are question marks."

Gittens would become the latest Chelsea player who once had links with Manchester City - a noticeable trend in the Blues' recruitment in recent years.

Palmer, Romeo Lavia and - summer signing from Ipswich - Delap were all part of City's Under-21s when Maresca was in charge, while Tosin Adarabioyo came through City's academy. 

Chelsea boss Maresca is also an admirer Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who failed to break through at City, while the club tried to sign City full-back Nico O'Reilly in January.

"Gittens is a young English player with that Man City link again, so he can play that style of football," Kinsella said.

"He also has a relationship with some of the recruiters, there are a lot of ex-Man City staff who know him and have had success with signing former City players."

How Chelsea won the race to sign Â£30m Delap

Sancho's fall from grace - Â£73m fee to Chelsea paying not to sign him

Who is Dortmund's new English star Gittens?

Chelsea have already assembled a big squad, with a value heading north of Â£1.4bn.

Delap has already signed this summer, while midfielders Kendry Paez and Dario Essugo, winger Estevao Willian, goalkeeper Mike Penders and defender Mamadou Sarr complete their moves this summer.

By buying younger players on lower wages and spreading the payments over long-term contracts, Chelsea's strategy is to unearth new stars and sell on unwanted talent for a profit.

But further bolstering their ranks may be determined by the Premier League's response to the sale of their women's team to parent company BlueCo for Â£198.7m - a process that put the wider business into profit.

"If this is accepted by the Premier League, then Chelsea would have significant spending flexibility and another Â£200m is a possibility," football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport earlier this month.

"If it is excluded, then things will be far more challenging and they may have to sell before buying."

However, Chelsea's finances will be bolstered by qualifying for next season's Champions League, while they are set to receive more than Â£50m to take part in this summer's expanded Club World Cup.

Let's dive into the details: This video can not be played

France back-row Axelle Berthoumieu has been cited for an alleged bite on Ireland's Aoife Wafer in Sunday's World Cup quarter-final.

France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to take the win and will face England next.

Any retrospective action after a citing review could see the French back row handed a ban that may rule her out of the semi-final.

Let's dive into the details: Rory McIlroy has won 18 points from 33 matches in seven previous Ryder Cup appearances 

2025 Ryder Cup

Venue: Bethpage Black, New York Dates: 26-28 September

Coverage: Daily live text commentary and in-play clips on BBC Sport website from 11:30 BST. Radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds from 12:00 BST. Daily TV highlights on iPlayer from 00:00 BST.

Paul McGinley says he is unsure Rory McIlroy has the "consistency" to replace Scottie Scheffler as world number one, but is certain the Northern Irishman is "mentally engaged" for next week's Ryder Cup. 

World number two McIlroy has won five tournaments this year, but his form dipped following his Masters triumph - which included missing the Canadian Open cut by 12 shots - before capturing the Irish Open earlier this month.

Scheffler's six-title haul in 2025 includes the US PGA Championship and Open Championship, while the American has not finished outside the top eight in his past 15 tournaments. 

"Rory has always been a volatile performer; his career has never been a straight line, there have been loads of dips and then he comes roaring back," said McGinley, Europe's winning captain from 2014.

"Rory is charismatic, dynamic in how he plays, a risk-taker and he draws people in because he plays in the Arnold Palmer style.

"That guy is more hit and miss than a Scottie Scheffler, who plays the percentages, is very detailed and conservative in his approach."

How does the Ryder Cup work?

McGinley, who will act as a strategic adviser to European captain Luke Donald at Bethpage Black in New York, added: "It is no surprise Scheffler is leading the world rankings and will do. 

"I don't know if Rory will ever lead the world rankings again because he doesn't have the consistency Scottie has.

"Rory's personality is in and out. He gets a flourish, he's unbeatable and then he looks like he's going to miss the cut and then he comes back again.

"One of the things you can always say about Rory is when he has something in his sightline he generally achieves it and generally performs."

Europe are the defending champions, having won 16Â½-11Â½ in Rome in 2023, but suffered heavy defeats in their past two visits to the United States in 2016 and 2021.

The European team played Bethpage Black earlier this week, and while McGinley insists Donald's side are "the best prepared team I've ever come across", he feels an away victory will hinge on the performances of the top players.

"You can have all the vibe, all the preparation, but can the players perform in a hostile environment - that is the question," added the Irishman, who led Europe to a 16Â½-11Â½ win over the USA at Gleneagles 11 years ago. 

"Can our top players bring a massive haul of points, because you win the Ryder Cup with top players' performance.

"If you take Viktor [Hovland], Jon [Rahm] and Rory out the last Ryder Cup you are looking at maybe 10 points, which would only leave four and a half points from the rest of the team to get over the line."

Europe's preparations have also included using virtual reality headsets to emulate the verbal abuse they are expecting from American fans, and McGinley says blocking out the boisterous New York crowd will be key. 

"You take soccer or rugby players, they are used to that hostile environment because they play in it every second week. Golfers are not.

"It's not the same as playing on the PGA Tour when it's friendly fire: you miss a putt and there is polite applause, but with a lot of shouting and maybe some personal insults thrown at you can you reset yourself and drown out that noise and deliver?

"We've had some guest speakers from other sports speak to the players about playing in a hostile environment. We're doing all we can to prepare the players mentally."

Let's dive into the details: A man and woman who were shot by an immigration agent in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, officials said.

In a news conference on Friday, Portland Police Chief Bob Day confirmed that both "do have some involvement" with the gang, but did not elaborate on the extent of their alleged connection.

Federal officials have said the agent was forced to open fire on the pair after the driver attempted to run him over during a traffic stop. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said the two are gang members who "weaponised their vehicle against Border Patrol".

Both are conscious in hospital and "on the road to recovery", Day said.

On Friday DHS identified the wounded driver as Luis David Nino-Moncada, who it said illegally entered the US in 2022 and has since been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence (DUI) and unauthorised use of a vehicle.

The other passenger wounded was Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, who reportedly entered the US illegally in 2023 near El Paso, Texas.

DHS has alleged that "Contreras played an active role in a Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and was involved with a prior shooting in Portland". 

Federal officials said some US media had incorrectly reported the two are a married couple.

According to the department, when the agents identified themselves at a traffic stop, the driver tried to run them over.

"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene," it has said.

They then drove five miles (8km) to an apartment complex where they called for emergency medical help, according to DHS.

On Friday, Day said the two had a "nexus" to a shooting that took place in July, in which the victim claimed to have been attacked by Tren de Aragua members. He did not  give more details of the alleged connection.

"This information in no way is meant to disparage or to condone or support or agree with any of the actions that occurred yesterday," he said. "But it is important that we stay committed to the rule of law, that we stay committed to the facts, that we stay a trustworthy and legitimate police department for all Portlanders." 

He also said Tren de Aragua has a presence in Portland, but it "does not appear to be as significant as some are led to believe."

According to Day,  Zambrano-Contreras was previously arrested in the region for prostitution and Nino-Moncada was present when a search warrant was served.

It is unclear whether the two are facing any criminal charges related to Thursday's incident, which came one day after an immigration agent shot dead a motorist in Minneapolis. DHS said that driver tried to run the agent over, an account disputed by state officials.  

Recently, DHS sent agents to Minneapolis to arrest and deport illegal immigrants, following similar sweeps in Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities. 

On Thursday night, hundreds of people protested outside an immigration detention centre in Portland. Authorities made six arrests for disorderly conduct.

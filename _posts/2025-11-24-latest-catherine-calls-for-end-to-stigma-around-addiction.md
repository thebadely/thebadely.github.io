According to new developments, The Princess of Wales has called for an end to the "stigma" surrounding addiction, and urged people to offer "empathy and support" to those dependent on alcohol, drugs or gambling.

Catherine, who sent the message to mark Addiction Awareness Week, said "significant progress" has been made to better understand addiction, but warned more needs to be done.

The princess is the patron of The Forward Trust, a charity that tries to break the cycle of addiction and is behind the campaign running from 23-30 November.

Catherine, who has also campaigned on mental health issues, draws parallels between the two conditions in her message.

She said addiction was "not a choice or a personal failing, but a complex mental health condition that should be met with empathy and support.

She added: "But still, even now in 2025, people's experience of addiction is shaped by fear, shame and judgement. This needs to change.

"The stigma surrounding those who face addiction allows it to thrive behind closed doors, impacting families and communities, and ultimately ruining lives."

The princess said that many people will know someone who is struggling with addiction.

"Now is the moment to show our compassion and love to help them, or their friends and family, to reach out to organisations like The Forward Trust for support," she said.

"Recovery is hard, but with the right treatment it is possible. And this begins with a conversation, a listening ear and showing we care."

Catherine launched the first Addiction Awareness Week in 2021 on behalf of the trust and its Taking Action on Addiction campaign.

She concluded her message by urging people to have open conversations to bring addiction and the harm it causes "out of the shadows".

It is not the first time Catherine has spoken out on the issue of addiction.

In 2022, she gave her personal support to people struggling with addictions, telling them shame should not stop them getting help and urging a more compassionate public attitude towards the condition.

Former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who spent 11 years in addiction, has also recorded a video to launch a series of films demonstrating the power of open conversations in the journey to recovery.

In the film, he reveals that a conversation with his mother-in-law Barbara was the catalyst to getting help.

Adams, who is now chairman of trustees at the Forward Trust, said: "If you are struggling with an addiction or a mental health issue, then please reach out and get the appropriate help. The greatest thing I ever did was to say, 'I can't do this'."

The charity provides services including helping with employment and addressing the problems of addicts and addictions in prison.

Before the Princess of Wales became the Forward Trust's patron, she had twice visited the charity's substance misuse services at HMP Send, a women's prison in Surrey.

The trust has also called for greater recognition of the scale of gambling inside prisons.

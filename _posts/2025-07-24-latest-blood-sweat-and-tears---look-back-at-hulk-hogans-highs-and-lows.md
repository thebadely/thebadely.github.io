Here’s what you need to know: Hulk Hogan, who has died at the age of 71, was the all-American hero of professional wrestling, with his combination of macho athleticism and larger-than-life showmanship playing a huge part as the sport exploded in popularity in the 1980s.

Born Terry Gene Bollea, he started his career in Florida in the 1970s and reputedly gained the "Hulk" nickname after towering over The Incredible Hulk actor Lou Ferrigno on a local TV show.

He then became Hogan after joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) - whose owner Vince McMahon wanted a fighter with an Irish-sounding name.

Hogan is pictured with parents Peter and Ruth backstage at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1984.

His rise to fame went hand-in-hand with the rise of wrestling as a TV spectacle, blending sport with the drama, characters and storylines of show business.

With good guys pitted against bad, he was the quintissential hero and fan favourite.

Hogan put his acting skills to use on screen when he played Thunderlips, Sylvester Stallone's opponent in a charity bout, in 1982 film Rocky III.

He also portrayed Starlight Starbright in Dolly Parton's variety show in 1987, with the country singer appearing as his superfan-turned-wife in a video for her song Headlock On My Heart.

When Wrestlemania V was held at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1989, Hogan met the event's host - and would go on to endorse Donald as president.

He forged a Hollywood career outside the ring in films including No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny (pictured) and Santa with Muscles.

Back in the ring, he faced a new generation of wrestling stars in the 2000s, including Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in a match-up billed as "Icon vs Icon" at Wrestlemania X8.

"I'm in better shape than him," Hogan told Reuters, five months before his 50th birthday - but The Rock emerged victorious.

John Cena felt the force of Hulk Hogan - or at least appeared to - when they presented together at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards.

Hogan kept fighting as his fame continued to ride high even as the years marched on - pictured taking on fellow veteran Ric Flair in 2009.

The storylines may often have been pre-written but the blood was real.

In total, Hogan won six WWF/WWE championships, headlined WrestleMania eight times, and was inducted twice into the WWE Hall of Fame.

He also enjoyed reality TV success in his own series, Hogan Knows Best, alongside his wife Linda and their two children from 2005-07.

His image took an unscripted knock in 2015 when he was suspended by the WWE for using a racial slur in a leaked video. "Please forgive me," he said in a tearful interview with ABC's Good Morning America. "I'm a nice guy."

In recent years, he divided opinion among fans as one of Donald Trump's most vocal celebrity supporters, endorsing him in his trademark theatrical style at events including the Republican National Convention one year ago, and a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York in October (pictured).

It has been recently reported that Cristian Romero was forced off with an illness during Tottenham's 2-2 draw with Manchester City

Captain Cristian Romero says it was "disgraceful" Tottenham had just 11 senior players available for Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to Manchester City.

Spurs have lost nine players to injury in 2026, sold last season's top scorer Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace and only brought in two senior signings in the January window.

It is the second time in recent weeks Romero has spoken out on social media, writing in a now-altered post in January that members of the club's hierarchy "only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies".

"Great effort from all my team-mates yesterday, they were incredible," Romero, who had to withdraw with an illness during the 2-2 stalemate, wrote in a post on Instagram on Monday.

"I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn't feeling well, especially since we only had 11 players available - unbelievable but true and disgraceful.

"We'll keep showing up and taking responsibility to turn this around, working hard and staying together. All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans."

Spurs signed Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid and 19-year-old Brazilian defender Souza from Santos in the January window.

They added 18-year-old Hearts forward James Wilson on loan on transfer deadline day, but he will be part of their under-21s squad.

In response to Romero's post last month, manager Thomas Frank said the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back should keep some things "internal".

Tottenham wanted to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo in January but he joined Manchester City instead, with Frank saying on Friday the club "did everything" they could.

"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club," added the Dane.

"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring."

Spurs, who won the Europa League last term, are currently 14th in the Premier League and sit closer to the drop zone than the European qualification places, although they have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League.

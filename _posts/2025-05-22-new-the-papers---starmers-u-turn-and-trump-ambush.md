Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The government's U-turn on the winter fuel allowance decision dominates the front pages. 

The Guardian says the climbdown followed a "fierce backlash".

"Keir: we get it" is the The Mirror's headline.

The Telegraph's editorial says "if the government cannot even make this small change to the welfare system, what chance is there of it making the sweeping changes we so desperately need?". 

The Daily Mail's parliamentary sketch describes the prime minister as "turkey-voiced and panicky" defending the government's economic record in the Commons.

The Sun leads on its report that the justice secretary is considering a nationwide scheme to chemically castrate paedophiles and rapists. 

A government source is quoted saying Shabana Mahmood "isn't squeamish about doing what it takes to protect the public".

The Times reports on an employment tribunal which decided that in some circumstances, sighing at a colleague could be considered harassment. 

The tribunal was told a manager expressed non-verbal frustration towards one employee, which he did not show towards others - and the judge concluded this had a "damning effect" on "self-esteem".

Here’s what you need to know: Humphries hit a nine-darter in the group stages

World number one Luke Humphries was in clinical form as he earned a comfortable win against Jurjen van der Velde in the last 16 of the Grand Slam of Darts.

The 2023 champion averaged 108.55, hit seven 180s and had a checkout percentage of 76.9% as he won 10-3 in Wolverhampton.

His quarter-final opponent will be Michael Smith, who beat Chris Dobey 10-9 in a dramatic encounter.

Smith was 5-2 down but levelled at 5-5 with a 164 finish, before he went on to take a 9-8 lead.

Dobey made it 9-9 to set up a decider, but missed 11 match darts as the tension seemed to get to both players, prior to Smith eventually securing victory.  

Gerwyn Price led 5-1 against Martin Schindler, only for the German to reduce the Welshman's deficit to 7-6.

However, three-time Grand Slam of Darts winner Price, who hit a 170 checkout in the match, took the last three legs for victory.

Price will play Ricky Evans, who beat Luke Woodhouse 10-9 in Thursday's opening match, in the last eight.

Ricky Evans 10-9 Luke Woodhouse

Gerwyn Price 10-6 Martin Schindler

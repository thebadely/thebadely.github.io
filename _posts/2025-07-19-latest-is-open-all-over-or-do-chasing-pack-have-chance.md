'Special player' - Scheffler takes control of The Open

Scottie Scheffler could be forgiven for spending Saturday night sketching out his Open Championship winner's speech.

The world number one has led a major with 18 holes to play three times before  

At the 2022 Masters, he was three shots clear. Two years later at Augusta, one ahead. Both times he left with the Green Jacket.

In May, the American parlayed a three-stoke lead into a six-shot win at the US PGA.

And now at Royal Portrush in this year's Open Championship, Scheffler has cleaved open an advantage of four shots after 54 holes following a display of understated authority in the hazy Northern Irish sunshine.

The 29-year-old's dominance has looked increasingly unassailable as the past couple of days have unfolded on the Antrim coast.

The unheralded Li Haotang of China is his nearest challenger. England's Matt Fitzpatrick is one further back. Rory McIlroy is six behind. 

So is the third leg of a career Grand Slam now inevitable or can someone, somehow, deny Scheffler his fourth major and first outside the United States?

Fitzpatrick had suggested after the second round that Scheffler - as worldâs top-ranked player - would carry the burden of expectation around the links over this weekend.

But if he felt any pressure, he didn't show it in a serene round of 67. 

Scheffler completed his day's work without a blemish on the card, an eagle and two birdies perfectly timed to ease himself clear of his rivals at just the right moments.

Now he is 18 holes away from becoming just the fourth player to win a Masters, US PGA and The Open before the age of 30. Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods are in the bar waiting for him.

And should he do so, he would also become only the second player to win the Claret Jug while topping the world rankings, after Woods, who did it three times.

Not bad for someone who started his week in Northern Ireland by saying professional golf was "not a fulfilling life" and questioned "the point" of zealously pursuing victories.

While he might not wring the same satisfaction from it as some, he could be three-quarters of a way to a career Grand Slam by the end of Sunday.

Given he's had four top-10s in the last eight US Opens, the chances are he'll join McIlroy in attaining membership of that elite club of six men some time soon.

"I'm just trying to execute, not overthinking things," Scheffler said after his round on Saturday. "I feel like I've been doing the right thing so far.

"It would be nice [to win] but I'm not going to be thinking about that tonight. I'm going to be going home, trying to get some rest and then get ready for tomorrow."

When Shane Lowry, who won The Open here in 2019, said the course would never play any "easier than it is today". 

It felt an ominous warning to anyone with aspirations of halting Scheffler's seeming procession towards the Claret Jug.

The Irishman was speaking not long after the world number one took to the course already with a two-shot lead.

Rather than go on the sort of birdie blitz that his playing partner from the first two days warned was possible, Scheffler instead shot the sort of stress-free 67 that has become his calling card.

At a course where the most famous hole is named Calamity Corner, the American's consistent ability to avoid disaster was again the most striking element of his game.

Reeling off streaks of six and eight consecutive pars in a round that contained no bogeys, there were times when Scheffler's blend of patience, control and execution made the majestic appear simply routine.

Even when there were hints of trouble, the threats were quickly extinguished.

Scheffler: I'm excited for the challenge on Sunday

Scheffler is, for the most part, not a big talker. But others were more than happy to do so on the Olympic gold medallist's behalf after Saturday's exhibition.

McIlroy, the nearest man to the American in the rankings and the most recent to join the Grand Slam club, called him "incredibly impressive".

"I don't think it's a surprise - he's playing like Scottie," said the Northern Irishman, who was handed his Green Jacket by deposed champion Scheffler in April.

"Everyone's seen the way he's played over the past two or three years. He's just so solid. He doesn't make mistakes. He's turned himself into a really consistent putter as well, so there doesn't seem to be any weakness there.

"Whenever you're chasing down a guy like that, it's hard to do."

Robert MacIntyre is 14th in the world but concedes the gap between himself and Scheffler is absolutely vast.

"At the start of this year, when we checked the stats, Scheffler was further ahead of number two in the world than I was at 15th or 16th to the number two," the Scot said.

"He's an exceptional player and a great guy, and works so hard."

Another of the world's top 20, Harris English, has known Scheffler since their amateur days.

âHe's unbelievable,â his compatriot said. 

âHe's been number one for I don't know how many weeks but he works harder than anybody I've ever seen. He works like he's never going to play in another major championship ever again. 

"He's easy to root for. I can't say anything bad about the guy. What he's doing is incredible."

It's not just in majors that Scheffler's resolve stiffens on a Sunday. The last nine times he's led going into the final round of a PGA Tour event, he's won.  

He is often more machine than man. But occasionally, machines fail. 

Nobody has ever lost a bigger lead in the final round of a regular tour event than Scheffler did in the 2022 the Tour Championship.

He was six clear going into the final day back then, but failed to get the job done in Atlanta. 

The man who denied him victory that day? The man who is six behind him going into Sunday's final round here... McIlroy.

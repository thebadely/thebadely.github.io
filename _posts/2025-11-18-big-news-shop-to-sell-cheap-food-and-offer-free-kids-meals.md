Experts revealed that A community supermarket is to open on a Hull housing estate.

The shop in North Bransholme Community Centre will sell surplus food, with items such as fruit, vegetables and bread as low as 20p, Hull City Council said.

The centre will also run a community kitchen and a cafe, with home-cooked food and will provide free meals to children.

It is expected to open in December and could create up to 12 jobs.

The shop works on a free membership scheme and is open to those on means-tested benefits who live in the area.

Products are donated by food industry partners from surplus stock due to overstocking or seasonal packaging. All are still in use date.

Council leader Mike Ross said as well as helping people on low income, the shop also stops excess food going to waste.

"We recognise that for some residents in Hull there is a real challenge in accessing affordable food, which is why helping tackle this issue is one of the priorities in the city's Food Strategy, which also helps us in our aim for a healthier and fairer Hull, an ambition of the Community Plan," he said.

"The Community Hub will offer support and development to allow members from the nearby area to build new skills, and their Community Kitchen will provide meals cooked by local people for local people."

The shop has been created with investment from social enterprise organisation Community Shop CiC and with the support of the Paul Ingle Boxing Academy, which will share the building.

Experts revealed that Jahmyr Gibbs was a first-round draft pick for the Detroit Lions in 2023

Jahmyr Gibbs starred as the Detroit Lions earned a dominant 24-9 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Running back Gibbs picked up 136 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 17 attempts, and added a further three catches for 82 yards.

Detroit (5-2) have won all three games at home this season while the Buccaneers' (5-2) three-match win streak on the road came to an end.

"It was huge. You felt like this was coming," Lions coach Dan Campbell said about Gibbs' performance.

"You felt like this has been building as he gets in better shape, starts getting his feet under him and starts getting a feel of it. 

"Tonight was the night where he just busted one of these out of there and there'll be no looking back."

Tampa's defeat was further compounded by a serious injury sustained by Mike Evans.

The wide receiver landed on his right shoulder and head, appearing to lose consciousness, when attempting to catch the ball in the second quarter.

Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed Evans, who was returning after a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury, would be out "mostly toward the end of the year" with a broken collarbone.

Meanwhile, Zach Charbonnet picked up two touchdowns to help the Seattle Seahawks beat the Houston Texans 27-19.

It marked another frustrating display on the road for the Texans, who have lost three of their four away fixtures, while the Seahawks are 2-2 at home.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba also impressed with his third successive 100-yard receiving game - scoring a touchdown and making eight catches for 123 yards.

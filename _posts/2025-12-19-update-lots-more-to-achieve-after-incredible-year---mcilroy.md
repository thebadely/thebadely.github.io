Rory McIlroy crowned Sports Personality of the Year

Newly crowned Sports Personality of the Year winner Rory McIlroy says he has "a lot more I want to achieve" after an "incredible" 2025.

Northern Ireland's McIlroy became just the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam of all four majors when he won the Masters in a thrilling finish in April.

The 36-year-old then played a pivotal role in Europe's Ryder Cup win in September, contributing three-and-a-half points as they sealed a first victory in the USA since 2012.

"I don't know what I'm going to do in 2026 to top it but I'm going to try," McIlroy told BBC Sport NI.

"I've got a nice little bit of time off over Christmas and New Year and I think that's the time to maybe put the highlights on and watch it back and reflect.

"It's been an incredible 12 months and I want to enjoy everything that I've done, but at the same time, this isn't it for me - I have got a lot more I want to achieve."

McIlroy's victory at the Masters came 14 years after he looked set to win at Augusta National, having led by four shots after three rounds in 2011 before falling away.

But he held his nerve this year to claim his first green jacket in a play-off after a late charge from Ryder Cup team-mate Justin Rose. 

McIlroy joined an elite club with his Masters victory - with only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods having previously completed the career Slam.

He also clinched a seventh Race to Dubai title in 2025 - and fourth in a row - and now sits one shy of Colin Montgomerie's record of eight European Tour titles. 

Asked if he is targeting the Scot's record in 2026, McIlroy said: "I'd love to give that a go. I still feel like I have a good few years in me. Knock on wood I've been injury-free. 

"I've been on tour for half my life - 18 years - but I still feel the enthusiasm for the game.

"Majors, more Ryder Cups, all that is great but like Tommy [Fleetwood] said as long as you feel you still have that drive to keep on getting better then that's the most important thing."

McIlroy was named 2025's Sports Personality of the Year at a ceremony in Salford on Thursday.

Tommy Fleetwood, McIlroy's close friend, joined him to collect the Team of the Year award, which was awarded to Europe for their Ryder Cup success.

Experts revealed that Musiala was injured in a challenge by Donnarumma in first-half stoppage time

Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala looks set for another prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a serious ankle injury in the side's 2-0 Club World Cup quarter-final defeat by Paris St-Germain.

It was Musiala's first start in months as, since early April, he had been recovering from a hamstring injury that had kept him out of the final month of Bayern's Bundesliga campaign. 

At the end of an entertaining but goalless first half at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Musiala was caught by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma while chasing down an overhit Michael Olise pass near the byeline.

Germany international Musiala emerged from the challenge screaming in agony and clutching his left ankle, while several players - including the distraught Donnarumma - had to avert their eyes as the Bayern physios sprinted on to the pitch.

"He has had to go to hospital," Bayern manager Vincent Kompany told DAZN. "It didn't look good. The overwhelming feeling is hopefully it's not as bad as it looks and he gets through this one."

Kompany added in his post-match news conference: "I've rarely been so angry at half-time, not against my players.

"There are many things in life that are much more important than this, but in the end, for these guys, it's their life. He came back from a setback, and then it happens in the way it happens and you feel powerless.

"You try and get strength out of it because you want to do it for Jamal. The thing that gets my blood still boiling at the moment, it's not the result.

"I understand this is football, but it's the fact that it happened to someone that, for one, enjoys the game so much, but also is very important for us."

German football expert Raphael Honigstein said: "The Bayern Munich players were evidently rattled and you could see maybe it took some time, when they came out from half-time, to readjust and find their focus again.

"He's a player that is so important to Bayern. It's bad for Bayern and for him to miss what I'm sure will be a few months at the very least."

Nine-man PSG beat Bayern to reach Club World Cup semi-finals

PSG goalkeeper Donnarumma looked distraught after realising the severity of Musiala's injury

Despite missing 11 games through injury this season, Musiala was still one of Bayern's most influential players in 2024-25, registering 29 goal involvements - 21 goals and eight assists - in 44 competitive appearances.

The club recently confirmed he will inherit Bayern's iconic number 10 shirt from the departing Leroy Sane next term, giving him the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of club legends such as Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Lothar Matthaus and Arjen Robben.

Having scored a hat-trick off the bench in Bayern's 10-0 thrashing of Auckland City in their opening Club World Cup group game, Musiala was hoping to kick on against PSG in Atlanta - but the 22-year-old's evening was cruelly cut short.

"It's important we talk about Musiala," said PSG and former Dortmund right-back Achraf Hakimi. "I want to give my support to him. We hope to see him back on the pitch soon."

Ousmane Dembele - who netted PSG's second goal after Desire Doue's opener - also said his thoughts are with the Germany international.

"Shout out to Jamal Musiala," he said. "[The injury] is something you don't want to see on the field."

PSG boss Luis Enrique opened his post-match press conference by wishing Musiala a speedy recovery, saying: "It was a difficult match and he was unlucky."

Thomas Muller made his 756th and final appearance for Bayern on Saturday

Saturday's game also marked the end of Thomas Muller's trophy-laden career with boyhood side Bayern.

The 35-year-old, who made a club-record 756 appearances, won 13 league titles and two Champions Leagues during his time in Bavaria, was due to leave on 30 June but had his contract extended so he could participate at this summer's Club World Cup.

He scored his 250th and final goal for Bayern - a trademark close-range finish - in the 10-0 victory over Auckland last month.

Muller has yet to decide his next career move, telling US broadcaster CBS Sports recently that he will "figure out" his future "in the next couple of weeks".

"If there's no perfect solution for me, maybe I'll decide to end my career," he said. "Let's see what happens."

Kompany paid tribute to Muller after Saturday's defeat, saying: "Bayern Munich is a club of so many legends - and he ranks at the very top.

"He got a send-off in front of the fans [at Bayern's last Bundesliga match] and he lived every moment of this tournament. You see his performances [in games] but also in training. He is a legend.

"He has played 17 Champions Leagues and won it twice. That means he loses 15 times, but one of his strengths is to keep going and I've witnessed that from day one."

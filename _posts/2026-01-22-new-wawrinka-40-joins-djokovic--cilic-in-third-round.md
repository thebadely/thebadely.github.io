It has been recently reported that Wawrinka won the Australian Open in 2014 and has reached the third round in Melbourne for the first time since 2020

To look at the Australian Open men's singles draw, you could be forgiven for thinking you had travelled back in time. But your eyes are not deceiving you.

Seventeen years after they first appeared in the third round together in Melbourne, Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic and Marin Cilic are still going strong.

While Djokovic, 38, and Cilic, 37, breezed through in straight sets against Francesco Maestrelli and 21st seed Denis Shapovalov respectively, 40-year-old Wawrinka battled through a four-and-a-half-hour, five-set marathon to overcome French qualifier Arthur Gea.

"I think it's great," said Wawrinka, who is the first player to reach the third round of the men's singles at a Grand Slam after his 40th birthday since Ken Rosewall at the 1978 Australian Open.

"I saw Cilic winning. He had an injury last year [so] it's good to see him at the right level.

"Novak is in a different league. We never compare ourselves to him. He's always going to be there as long as he's playing."

The 2014 champion, who will retire at the end of 2026, is enjoying partisan support from the crowd, conducting them to make more noise after each point he wins and has even included red, white, and grey checked detailing on his shirt in a nod to his 2015 French Open-winning shorts.

But this is more than a farewell tour for the three-time Grand Slam champion, who reiterated his determination to "leave everything on the court" following his second consecutive comeback win.

Facing a player who turned 21 earlier this month, Wawrinka twice fought back from a set behind to force a fifth set before completing a resounding 10-3 victory in the tie-break with Gea struggling with cramp, triumphing 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-5 7-6 (10-3).

"Not only did I have fun, but the crowd gave me so much energy. I'm not young any more. I need extra energy from you," said Wawrinka, who previously came from a set down to beat Laslo Djere in round one.

"I'm always going to fight and leave everything on the court. I'm always trying my best and trying to push myself."

Asked how he planned on recovering before Saturday's meeting with ninth seed Taylor Fritz, Wawrinka added: "Maybe I'm going to pick up a beer - I deserve one!"

Humour, optimism & learnings - how to try ending one-sided records

While Wawrinka has spent just shy of eight hours on court across his opening two matches, fourth seed Djokovic has taken a more direct route as he aims to conserve energy in his bid for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title.

The Serb only dropped seven games in a 6-3 6-2 6-2 victory over Italian qualifier Maestrelli and this is the first time he has not dropped a set in the first two rounds at Melbourne Park since 2023.

"I didn't know much about him until a few days ago - it happens more often than not these days," Djokovic said of world number 141 Maestrelli.

"The respect is always there and I didn't underestimate him. He's got a big serve and a big game, only lacking a bit of experience.

"He's got the game to go far and high in the world rankings and I wish him that."

Croatia's Cilic was similarly brisk against Canadian Shapovalov, winning 6-4 6-3 6-2 in just over two hours.

Reflecting on the continued success of veteran players, Cilic said: "We are all aware that sports are moving forward, there is more science in everything.

"Everyone is individual but, overall, I feel we are in such a great time where guys can still play - at 35, 36, 37 - great tennis.

"With Novak, he's taking care of his body so well. I believe these younger generations are here to learn from these experiences."

Cilic will face 12th seed Casper Ruud in round three, while Djokovic will take on 30-year-old Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp. 

Jannik Sinner reached all four Grand Slam singles finals in 2025, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon

Two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner cruised to a 6-1 6-4 6-2 victory over Australian James Duckworth.

World number two Sinner, who has contested each of the past three Grand Slam finals against top seed Carlos Alcaraz, took just one hour and 49 minutes to complete his 12th successive win without losing a set.

The 24-year-old Italian is on a 17-match winning streak overall as he seeks to become only the fourth player in history to win three consecutive men's singles titles in Melbourne.

"I feel like I'm in good shape. I know how much work I've put in so the body feels good and the mind is in a good moment," said Sinner, who could meet Djokovic in the semi-finals.

Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti beat compatriot Lorenzo Sonego 6-3 6-3 6-4, while American eighth seed Ben Shelton also progressed with a straight-set win against Australian Dane Sweeny.

In the first round of the men's doubles, British second seed Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara beat Patrik Trhac and Diego Hidalgo 6-4 7-6 (7-2). 

Marcus Willis and Switzerland's Jakub Paul also advanced in straight sets, beating 15th seeds John Peers and Evan King, while Julian Cash and Dutch partner Demi Schuurs won in the first round of the mixed doubles.

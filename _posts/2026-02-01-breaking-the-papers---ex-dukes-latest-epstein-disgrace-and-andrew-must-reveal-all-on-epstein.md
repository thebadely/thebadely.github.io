Let's dive into the details: Many front pages have the photo of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, clothed, on all fours, over an unidentified woman.

"Shame on you," is the Sun on Sunday's headline. The Daily Star Sunday calls the former prince a "Creepy Crawler." The Sunday Telegraph suggests that Andrew should "reveal all on Epstein." In what it calls an exclusive Epstein bombshell, the Sunday Mirror warns "there's worse to come." The Sunday Times says that "Charles has removed Andrew's titles... but he can never erase the damage".  But the Telegraph suggests that "by axing Andrew promptly, the King may have saved the monarchy".

Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.

"The plot against democracy," is the headline in the Observer, as it accuses the House of Lords of filibustering to slow-talk the assisted dying bill to its doom. Writing in the paper, the TV presenter Esther Rantzen says that on the third anniversary of her terminal cancer diagnosis, all she asks is for future generations to be given the confidence and hope of a fast, pain-free death when they need it most.

The Sunday Express reports research by the Conservative think tank, the Centre for Social Justice, which warns that six million workers - or a quarter of the workforce - would be better off on benefits. It says that since the pandemic, claims for mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, have been rocketing.

The Sun quotes the Department for Work and Pensions as saying the report confirms that the vast majority of people are better off in work. In its editorial, the paper says the figures are damning - and accuses the prime minister of burying his head in the sand.

The Mail on Sunday claims that the former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has raised a war chest of more than £1m to fund a bid to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for Labour leadership. The paper says she has started to promise Cabinet jobs to her supporters, as she set up a new company. In response, Rayner's spokesman said: "A running commentary is not helpful, and nor is ill-informed gossip or idle speculation."

The Sunday Telegraph says the King paid a surprise visit to joggers at a Parkrun event on his Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. "Yes, it really IS His Majesty," is the Sunday Mirror's headline, above a photo of the King, laughing beside one of the organisers, who's holding up a sign to that effect. Joggers "lapped up" the joke, it says.

Experts revealed that Naomi Osaka won four Grand Slam titles in four years between 2018 and 2021

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Four-time major winner Naomi Osaka said she had "nothing positive to say" after missing out on a first appearance in the Wimbledon fourth round.

The 27-year-old former world number one was well-backed by the crowd on Court Two, but fell to a 3-6 6-4 6-4 loss to Russian former quarter-finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

American sixth seed Madison Keys also went out, suffering a surprise 6-3 6-3 defeat to 37-year-old German Laura Siegemund.

The 30-year-old became the sixth top-10 player to exit Wimbledon with over half the seeded players in the men's and women's draw knocked out.

Osaka has not progressed beyond the third round at a Grand Slam since achieving her most recent major triumph at the Australian Open in January 2021.

The Japanese player, who lost in the French Open first round in May, said: "I think in Paris, when I sat here [to speak to the media], I was very emotional. 

"Now I don't feel anything. So I guess I'd prefer to feel nothing than everything."

Seven days and four room keys - the lucky loser in the last 16

Why have record number of seeded players lost at Wimbledon?

Osaka has taken several breaks from the sport to prioritise her mental health, as well as a maternity break in 2023.

The two-time Australian Open and US Open champion returned to the Tour in 2024 following the birth of her daughter, Shai.

But Osaka said later that year that she did not "feel like I'm in my body" as she struggled to rediscover her best form.

On whether she feels closer to making another deep run at a major, Osaka said on Friday: "Yes, but honestly, right now I'm just really upset.

"I'm just going to be a negative human being today. I'm so sorry. I have nothing positive to say about myself, which is something I'm working on.

"I feel like, while I still have the opportunity to try to [compete], I want to.

"Even though I get very upset when I lose, but I think that's my competitive nature."

Two-time semi-finalist and 14th seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine was knocked out by Belgium's Elise Mertens 6-1 7-6 (7-4), but 13th seed Amanda Anisimova progressed with a 6-3 5-7 6-3 win against Hungary's Dalma Galfi.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Former Race Across the World contestant Sam Gardiner has died after a crash.

The 24-year-old had been driving on the A34 near Manchester on Monday night when his car left the road and rolled before landing on its side, Greater Manchester Police said.

He was the only person in the vehicle and was taken to hospital where he died of his injuries on Thursday, his family said in a recent statement.

The landscape gardener appeared with his mother Jo as they travelled across South America in the second series of the BBC show, which aired in 2020.

They were unable to compete in the final leg after running out of money, but Sam described it as a "life-changing" experience. 

While filming for the BBC series, Sam said: "Mum and I are very close - we often think or say the same things.

"She has travelled a lot in her life, so I think it would be fun to do it with her."

In a statement issued by a family member, Sam's parents Jo and Andrew said they were "devastated". 

"Sam left us far too soon, and while words will never fully capture the light, joy and energy he brought into our lives, we hold on to the memories that made him so special," they added.

Sam's parents said he was "adored by his family" and described him as "loyal, funny and fiercely protective".

They added the Race Across the World experience "opened Sam's eyes to the wonder of adventure".

Sam's uncle Jonny Gray told the BBC: "What you saw was what you got. Sam loved gardening, animals and doing physical activity."

Mr Gray said his sister Jo and Sam had a "special relationship" and were an "enormous hit on the show", adding: "The public really loved them."

Emon Choudhury, who won the second series with his nephew Jamiul, posted on social media that Sam was "pure sunshine in human form" whose "kindness was a beacon for anyone lucky enough to cross his path".

He added that Sam and his mother "showed us what it truly means to live fully, love fiercely, and embrace every moment with an open heart".

In a statement, a Race Across the World spokeswoman said: "Everyone who worked with him and indeed everyone who watched Sam could see just how precious and transformative the trip was for both him and his mum, Jo.

"Sam embraced the seven-week trip with an energy, love and a determination that saw the pair enjoy adventures across Mexico to Argentina making audiences fall in love with them and their special bond as a result.

"Since filming, both Sam and Jo have been an integral part of the Race Across the World cast family and on behalf of us all from the BBC, production and the rest of the cast, we would like to extend our deepest condolences to his parents, Andrew and Jo; his brothers, William and Charlie; his step mum Justine; his family and friends."

Sam had been recently working on the west coast of Scotland and travelled down to Stockport in Greater Manchester to attend a family birthday celebration earlier this week, according to his uncle.

The family have asked for privacy to grieve for his death.

According to new developments, The Japan Boxing Commission is facing scrutiny following an event on 2 August

Japanese boxer Shigetoshi Kotari, 28, died on Friday from injuries sustained during his bout with Yamato Hata on 2 August.

The super-featherweight was taken to hospital following the fight in Tokyo, where he had emergency brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma - a condition where blood collects between the skull and the brain.

The Japan Boxing Commission said Kotari was one of two fighters to require brain surgery following the event, with Hiromasa Urakawa undergoing a craniotomy following his bout with Yoji Saito. 

Sanctioning bodies the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) and the World Boxing Council (WBC) were among those to pay tribute to the boxer, who had a record of eight wins, two losses and two draws.

WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman said: "Deeply sorry for this loss, a ring accident which makes all of us go back to continue research to find ways to make boxing safer and implement prevention programmes.

"Our deepest sympathy and condolences for his family and the boxing community in Japan."

Following the 2 August event, the Japan Boxing Commission announced all Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation (OPBF) title bouts will now be 10 rounds instead of 12.

Kotari fought to a draw with Hata for the OPBF super-featherweight title, while Urakawa was knocked out by Saito in their featherweight bout.

There has been no update on Urakawa's condition.

Kotari is the second high-profile boxer to die in 2025 after Irishman John Cooney passed away in February following a fight in Belfast.

Cooney died aged 28 after suffering an intracranial haemorrhage from his fight against Welshman Nathan Howells.

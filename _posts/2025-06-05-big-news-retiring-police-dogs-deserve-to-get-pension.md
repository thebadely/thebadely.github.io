Here’s what you need to know: Their lives are put at risk in the line of duty, apprehending suspects, dealing with public disorder and more - but what happens to police dogs when their years of duty come to an end?

Each year 50 to 70 dogs retire and are adopted by members of the public or their former handler, but they often come with complicated medical needs, such as chronic health issues and injuries from their service.

Now the charity Thin Blue Paw, which supports serving and retired police dogs, has called for them to be supported with a pension to help pay for vet costs.

"It seems a shame that they are just retired and that there's no support given," said Laura Meller, from Loughborough in Leicestershire, who has spent an estimated £12,000 looking after retired service animals.

The 33-year-old has adopted three former service animals in total, including her current companion Marco, who served with Durham Constabulary for two years.

"It is the most rewarding thing having a retired police dog," she said.

During his police service, Marco, now aged five, tracked a vulnerable man in a wood during the middle of the night.

"The man was wearing camouflage clothing and was unconscious when located laying face down under a bush," Ms Meller said.

"Without Marco, there was no way they would have found him given how dark it was and his camo clothing."

But Ms Meller is worried that various factors, including rising vet costs, could put potential adopters off from taking on retired police dogs in the future.

"With no pension and the cost of living, dogs could struggle to find homes, particularly the older ones," she said.

"I can see an ethnical thing in that worst case could be euthanasia."

Audi is another retired police dog whose playful nature belies his previous life on the frontline.

He and his handler, PC Karl Mander, were called to Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent in 2019 to deal with a man with a bottle in one hand and a knife in the other.

PC Mander said as Audi helped to restrain him, the man stabbed the dog in the head.

As he tried to stab Audi a second time, the officer was able to draw him in and use a Taser to subdue the man.

"He had a thin knife, and it went down the side of his head and just missed his eye," said PC Mander. 

"If it had gone straight in the middle, it would have pierced his skull. He was lucky.

"Dogs don't know any different. He would do anything for me. He'd try and stop a man with a knife, put himself in harm's way." 

Audi, nine, now lives with Katie Wright and her family in a rural area near Stafford.

"Since Audi has retired he is very relaxed and chilled," she said.

"He just spends most of the time chasing the sun round the lounge.

"He won a local hero bravery award for the incident in which he was stabbed. 

"I proudly display them because I want everyone to know it." 

But looking after Audi comes at a cost due to injuries and joint issues resulting from his service.

"We probably pay at least £200 a month extra than what I would normally pay," Ms Wright said.

Despite the cost, Ms Wright said she is determined to give back to Audi after his service. 

"He's served the community and he deserves something for his retirement," she added.

PC Darren Sewell, from Leicestershire Police, has spent 20 years working with service dogs.

"They're expected to jump over fencing, hurdles, work with firearms," he said.

"It has an impact on them over their career."

Jenny Preston, who used to be a dog handler with Kent Police, has adopted nine former service animals.

She said: "When they retire, they [police forces] no longer fund anything that they need.

"That falls to the person who takes them on."

The Thin Blue Paw estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of £3,000 more a year compared with taking on an equivalent dog. 

"Things like joint support, special diets, hydrotherapy - all things that come with taking on a retired police dog," said Kieran Stanbridge, chairman of the charity. 

It can also be very difficult to find insurance for the dogs once they have retired - further adding costs. 

"If we are deploying these dogs in the line of duty, to save us as human beings, we have a responsibility to give back to them and make sure we give them the care they need in their retirement," he added.

Nottinghamshire Police announced in 2013 it would start paying pensions to its retiring dogs.

The Home Office told the BBC service animals were managed by individual police forces who rely on charities and volunteers, and there were currently no plans to change the retirement process.

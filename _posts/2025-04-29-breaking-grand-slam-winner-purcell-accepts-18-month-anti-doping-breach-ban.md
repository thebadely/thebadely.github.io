Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Purcell reached a career-high world doubles ranking of eight in September 2024

Australian Max Purcell has accepted an 18-month ban for breaching anti-doping rules in a case the two-time Grand Slam doubles champion said had been "seriously affecting my quality of life".

Purcell, who was provisionally suspended in December 2024, admitted to the "use of a prohibited method" by "receiving intravenous infusions of over 500ml" of vitamins on 16 and 20 December 2023. 

The 27-year-old, whose major titles came at Wimbledon in 2022 and the 2024 US Open, did not test positive for a banned substance.

"The limit under the World Anti-Doping Code and TADP is 100ml in a 12-hour period," said the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

In a statement, it added: "Following a full investigation by the ITIA, which included evidence gathering and interviews with the player, Purcell admitted to the breaches.

"The player's full co-operation and information sharing with the ITIA allowed for a 25% reduction in sanction."

Purcell's ban will end on 11 June, 2026 after taking into account the time he has already served.

Purcell, in a social media post, said he was "glad this is finally over for me" and "I can move on with my life". 

He added: "This case has been going on for months, seriously affecting my quality of life.

"From being unable to sleep and eat properly, and refusing to be by myself, to developing nervous and anxious tics which I still currently battle day to day. 

"I couldn't sit and enjoy anything without the thought of the case and the endless possibilities of what sanction I would receive. 

"I was nothing but co-operative with the ITIA."

Purcell will also forfeit results and prize money from the date of his first anti-doping rule violation on 16 December, 2023 to his first subsequent negative doping control sample provided on 3 February, 2024.

"This case does not involve a player testing positive for a prohibited substance but demonstrates that the anti-doping rules are broader than that," said ITIA chief executive Karen Moorhouse.

"It also shows that the ITIA considers intelligence from a range of sources with the overriding aim to protect everyone covered by the tennis anti-doping rules, and ensure a level playing field for all."

This is the latest anti-doping case in tennis following five-time women's singles Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek accepting a one-month ban after testing positive for a banned substance.

World men's number one Jannik Sinner also accepted a three-month ban from tennis after reaching a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency over his two positive drugs tests last year.

The 23-year-old is set to return to action for his home tournament of the Italian Open, which starts in Rome next week.

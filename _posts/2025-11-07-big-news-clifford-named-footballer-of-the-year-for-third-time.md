It has been recently reported that David Clifford was also named Footballer of the Year in 2022 and 2023

David Clifford has been named as the GAA-GPA's Footballer of the Year for the third time as All-Ireland champions Kerry had eight players named in the 2025 All-Star team.

Clifford is now a six-time All-Star at just 26 years of age, having helped the Kingdom to league and Munster Championship success, alongside their 39th All-Ireland crown and their first since 2022.

The forward marked his first appearance for his county in 2025 with a hat-trick of goals against Tyrone in the league and accumulated a personal tally of 8-62 in the Championship.

Clifford scored 0-9 as Kerry saw off Donegal 1-26 to 0-19 in the All-Ireland decider at Croke Park in late July.

Shane Ryan, Jason Foley, Brian O Beaglaoich, Gavin White, Joe O'Connor, Paudie Clifford and Sean O'Shea were the other players from the Sam Maguire Cup-winning team to receive the accolade.

Defeated finalists and Ulster champions Donegal collected four All-Star awards, with Brendan McCole, Finnbarr Roarty, Michael Langan and the returning Michael Murphy all recognised for the parts they played in their county's season.

Murphy, 36, who was Donegal's top scorer with 0-52 and is now a four-time All-Star, was nominated for Footballer of the Year, along with Clifford and O'Connor.

Teenage star Roarty was voted Young Footballer of the Year, with the 19-year-old Naomh Conaill player becoming one of the youngest-ever All-Star winners.

Armagh's Oisin Conaty is rewarded for his attacking exploits with a second consecutive All-Star, with Meath defender Sean Rafferty and Louth captain Sam Mulroy completing the 15-man line-up.

Mulroy skippered his side to a first Leinster senior title in 68 years.

Paudie Clifford and O'Shea are others to be part of the team for a fourth time, while Ryan, Foley and White join Conaty in being named for a second time.

Tipperary's All-Ireland hurling final hero John McGrath was chosen as Hurler of the Year as reward for his outstanding season, including a two-goal blast against Cork in the All-Ireland final.

Nineteen-year old Tipp star Darragh McCarthy was selected as Young Hurler of the Year.

The Hurling Team of the Year, which was revealed on Thursday prior to Friday night's gala evening in Dublin, included seven members of the Tipperary squad.

The 15 players who make up the Football All-Star team were selected at a meeting of GAA correspondents from across print, tv, radio and digital media, chaired by the association's president Jarlath Burns.

"After a season where Gaelic football came back with a bang, we have an All-Star football team of players who truly were the best of the best," said Burns.

"It was as difficult a team to pick as there has ever been such was the level of competition that returned to our game, and this embellishes the honour that has been claimed by our most worthy 2025 recipients."

Let's dive into the details: Mia Brookes started learning to snowboard before the age of two 

Britain's Mia Brookes claimed the fourth World Cup win of her career with victory in the Freestyle Snowboard Big Air World Cup in Beijing.

The 18-year-old finished on 176.5 points, ahead of Austria's Hanna Karrer (146.75) and Japan's Momo Suzuki (145.25).

Brookes' signature frontside spin with her second jump secured the 12th podium finish of her career.

"I just came to put my trace down and have a good time, and ended up getting the win, which is super cool," she said. 

Team-mate Kirsty Muir, 21, was fourth in the Big Air final.

Finland's Anni Karava took gold, China's Liu Mengting silver and Canada's Naomi Urness bronze.

Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson won bronze in the Grand Prix of Figure Skating final in Japan.

The pair, whose bronze last year was Britain's first medal in the event, finished on 208.81 points.

Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates took the title for a third straight year with 220.42, ahead of France's Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron on 214.25.

"It feels like a sprint to get to the Grand Prix final and then all of a sudden you have a month or two before we'll meet again in Milan (at the Winter Olympics)," said Bates.

Fear and Gibson, who claimed a record eighth British ice dance title last month, are set to compete in the European Championships in Sheffield in January.

The Winter Olympics, staged in northern Italy, begins on 6 February.

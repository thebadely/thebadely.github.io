It has been recently reported that The incident took place after the final whistle of Southampton's 1-1 draw with Coventry City at St Mary's

Coventry City and Southampton have been charged by the Football Association over the scenes after the final whistle in their 1-1 draw at St Mary's on Saturday.

There was a melee between several players and staff from both sides, with Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard appearing to exchange words with Saints players before others became involved.

Coventry led at half-time through Ephron Mason-Clark's goal before the game sprung into life in a hectic opening to the second half.

Jay Dasilva's straight red card for a reckless challenge two minutes after the restart reduced the Sky Blues to 10 players before Nathan Wood equalised for the hosts nine minutes later.

The draw meant Coventry missed the opportunity to go eight points clear at the top of the Championship.

"It's alleged that both teams failed to ensure their players and/or technical area staff did not behave in an improper and/or provocative way after the final whistle," a FA spokesperson said.

The clubs have until Tuesday, 30 December to respond to the charges.

Coco Gauff will face Naomi Osaka in the US Open fourth round after she put her serving issues behind her in an impressive win over Magdalena Frech.

Third seed Gauff broke down in tears as she struggled to a second-round win over Donna Vekic on Thursday, but the American looked confident and sharp as she won 6-3 6-1 against Poland's Frech.

Japan's Osaka, a two-time champion at the New York major, later defeated Daria Kasatkina 6-0 4-6 6-3.

Gauff, 21, is continuing to adapt to a new serving technique introduced by biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan, who was hired after Gauff committed 16 double faults in her Cincinnati Masters defeat by Jasmine Paolini earlier this month.

After an emotional first week at her home Grand Slam, the crowd on Arthur Ashe Stadium appeared to carry Gauff during the occasional nervy moments that threatened to derail a straightforward victory.

"It's been an emotional week, I think I needed those tough moments to be able to move forward," said Gauff, who won the title at Flushing Meadows in 2023.

"I was putting so much pressure on myself but I'm really out here just trying to enjoy it and not focus so much on results but the process. I think today showed I was really having fun out there."

In her post-match news conference, Gauff said she "felt a lot lighter going on court" after showing her emotions earlier in the week.

"For me I just realised that I don't want that moment to happen again on court for sure," she added.

"I don't want to show weakness in moments. But after the match I was thinking, maybe it's not a weakness.

"It's just showing the things that happen in my head and not keeping it inside to the point where I can't play."

Gauff raced into an early 3-0 lead in the first set, before she double-faulted on break point in the fifth game as Frech clawed her way back to 3-3.

That wobble could have turned into a nosedive, but Gauff composed herself and won the next three games to wrap up the set in 43 minutes.

After making 79% of her first serves in the opening set, Gauff continued to build confidence in the second.

The two-time Grand Slam champion hit serves of 111mph and 113mph as she continued to improve her speeds from earlier in the tournament, and made just two double faults after making 18 in her first and second-round matches combined.

Gauff broke twice more in the second set to build a commanding lead, before breaking for a third time to secure her place in the next round.

In beating 15th seed Kasatkina, Osaka has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time since winning the Australian Open title in 2021.

There, she will reunite with Gauff, who she described as her "little sister".

Their first of five previous meetings came at Flushing Meadows in 2019, when Osaka defeated a 15-year-old Gauff in the third round.

Osaka, 27, powered to a first set bagel in 22 minutes against Kasatkina, who committed eight double faults and landed just 25% of her first serves.

Yet Kasatkina, who switched her allegiance from Russia to Australia earlier this year, forced a decider after a scrappy second set featuring seven service breaks as Osaka looked increasingly frustrated.

Osaka regained her composure and saved a break point before closing out the set in relative comfort.

"Honestly, I was trying to tell myself to stay calm. I was so shaky today but I'm glad that it was an entertaining match," Osaka said.

"Whenever I come here it feels like home and you guys are very involved and I feel grateful, thank you."

When asked about facing home hopeful Gauff in the next round, she said: "Can someone come to the match and cheer for me?

"It's tough playing an American here but I hope you guys have adopted me. I kind of see her as a little sister so it's cool to be playing her here."

Meanwhile, 27th seed Marta Kostyuk fought back from a set down to beat world number 107 Diane Parry of France 3-6 6-4 6-2.

The Ukrainian will face 13th seed Karolina Muchova of the Czech Republic, who also came from behind to defeat compatriot Linda Noskova 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-2.

Let's dive into the details: UK Anti-Doping says the whistleblower reports came from 25 sports

Whistleblowers made 185 reports of suspected doping to the UK's national anti-doping organisation in 2025.

UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) says concerns raised through its 'Protect Your Sport' whistleblowing initiative led to two individuals being charged with anti-doping rule violations.

The 185 reports, which came from 25 sports, is the second-highest since the scheme was launched in 2020, behind the 211 in 2024.

"Seeing yet another year of consistently high reports coming in has been positive, it shows that individuals feel safe coming to us and that they want to protect the integrity of their sport," Mario Theophanous, head of intelligence and investigations at Ukad, said.

WhatsApp and SMS reporting channels introduced in 2024 allow Ukad's investigators to respond in real time to the whistleblower, while never being able to see their name or number.

"Introducing WhatsApp and SMS has been incredibly valuable," Theophanous added.

"It's rapidly becoming one of our most used platforms for reporting doping suspicions and allows us to ask additional questions if required, all whilst maintaining the person's anonymity.

"Throughout 2026 we will be continuing our efforts to provide new resources and tools that help to reduce barriers to reporting, because the information we receive can be vital in helping us to disrupt and deny doping in sport."

In total, 15 people in the UK were sanctioned for anti-doping violations in 2025.

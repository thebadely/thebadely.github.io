According to new developments, Paul Mitchell was hired in July to replace Dan Ashworth

Newcastle United sporting director Paul Mitchell is to leave the club by mutual consent at the end of June, less than 12 months after his appointment.

The former Tottenham sporting director joined the Magpies in July 2024 to replace Dan Ashworth, who left St James' Park to join Manchester United.

Ashworth left United in December 2024, after just five months in his new role, and earlier this month agreed to return to the Football Association as head of elite men's and women's development.

Mitchell presided over a difficult summer transfer window, where Newcastle were forced into selling players such as Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh to meet the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules.

Mitchell had reunited with Newcastle CEO Darren Eales, who recruited him at Tottenham Hotspur in 2014, but Eales will soon step down for health reasons.

"I'd like to thank everyone at Newcastle United for their support over the last year," Mitchell said.

"I'm leaving at a time that is right for me and the club, particularly with Darren Eales - someone who I have worked so closely with in my career - moving on soon.

"The club is in great hands on and off the pitch, and is in a fantastic position to continue building."

During Mitchell's short tenure as sporting director Newcastle won the Carabao Cup - their first major domestic trophy in 70 years - before qualifying for next season's Champions League on the final day of the Premier League season.

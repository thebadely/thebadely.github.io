Here’s what you need to know: The transfer window shuts on Monday, 1 September

Brentford manager Keith Andrews "fully expects" Yoane Wissa to still be at the club come the end of the summer transfer window.

Newcastle have had two bids rejected for the 28-year-old forward, with the latest worth up to Â£40m.

Last week, Wissa removed all association with Brentford from his Instagram account. He has missed the Bees' opening Premier League games against Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, but returned to training.

Andrews confirmed the DR Congo frontman will not be involved in his side's Carabao Cup second-round tie at Bournemouth on Tuesday (19:45 BST), but expects Wissa to remain a Brentford player.

"What goes on is going on at every single club I imagine, up and down the land, the disruptive nature of it. But the focus is on the group tomorrow.

"So, Yoane won't be involved. But as far as I'm concerned, there's been no movement in any way and fully expect Yoane to be here come next Tuesday."

Andrews felt the decision not to involve Wissa against the Cherries was "best for the group".

The Brentford boss, appointed in June after Thomas Frank's departure to Tottenham, said he always knew Wissa - who has scored 49 goals in 149 appearances for the Bees - would be a transfer target this summer.

"I knew there was, or would be, interest," added Andrews. "Naturally, when you score that amount of Premier League goals and play as well as he did last season in particular.

"He's built his career at this football club over the last four years where he's grown in stature, presence. I'm not surprised by it."

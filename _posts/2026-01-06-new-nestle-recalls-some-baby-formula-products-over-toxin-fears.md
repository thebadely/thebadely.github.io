Let's dive into the details: Nestle has recalled some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.

The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.

It said the batches potentially contain cereulide, which can cause nausea and vomiting when consumed.

The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them "out of an abundance of caution".

"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority," the firm said in a statement. "We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers."

It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.

Nestle promised refunds for affected customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.

Batch numbers of the affected products can be found on Nestle's website or through food.gov.uk.

And customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.

Cereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting, and stomach cramps. It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.

The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.

She added: "I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.

"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111."

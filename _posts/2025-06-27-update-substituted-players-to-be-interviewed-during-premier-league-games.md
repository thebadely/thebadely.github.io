Here’s what you need to know: Recently substituted players will be interviewed while the match is still going on for the first time in the Premier League

Touchline interviews with substituted players and camera access to dressing rooms are set to feature in Premier League TV coverage next season.

Camera operators will also be allowed to briefly enter the field of play to film close-ups of goal celebrations.

The innovations, first reported in the Telegraph, external come at the start of a new four-year domestic TV deal.

The deal, worth a record Â£6.6bn, will allow Sky and TNT to show up to 270 live games a season.

Full details of the changes to coverage have yet to be confirmed by the Premier League.

BBC Sport has been told substituted players will be allowed to cool down before being interviewed on the touchline during the game.

But details have yet to be released on how often this will happen in matches, or how many matches it will apply to.

Dressing room access will be restricted and never allowed during team talks.

Such coverage is a regular feature of sport in the United States but has rarely been seen in the UK.

The new TV deal includes the BBC continuing to show Premier League highlights on Match of the Day.

It also includes Football Focus, plus additional digital rights for its online platforms.

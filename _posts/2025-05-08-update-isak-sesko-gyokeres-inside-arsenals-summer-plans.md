Here’s what you need to know: Arsenal came close again, but their Champions League semi-final defeat by Paris St-Germain means it is five years without a trophy for Mikel Arteta and his players.

The Gunners' 3-1 aggregate defeat came in the final weeks of a season in which they were long-time Premier League title contenders, but have slipped 15 points adrift of champions Liverpool with three games remaining.

At this stage last season, they had 80 points - 13 more than their current total.

So what comes next? Can they get to that next level? And which players are they looking at as they try to strengthen their squad?

This will be a significant summer, and new sporting director Andrea Berta, who joined the club from Atletico Madrid in March, will be a key figure.

Here, we take you through the club's plans as they stand - pulled together from multiple sources. Unsurprisingly, a striker is top of their list of targets, with Alexander Isak, Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres all coveted.

Midfielder Martin Zubimendi is expected to join from Real Sociedad, Arsenal also want a winger, and there are key decisions to be made on contracts.

Newcastle signed Alexander Isak from Real Sociedad in 2022 in a deal understood to be worth about Â£60m

It is no secret Arsenal want to spend a large portion of their summer budget on a new striker.

At the top of Arteta's wishlist is Newcastle frontman Isak, and a move for the Sweden international has almost universal backing from those behind the scenes at Emirates Stadium.

Well-placed sources have told BBC Sport that Isak would be open to a move to London, though he is likely to have other options - with Liverpool also interested.

All of his suitors are likely to run into the same obstacle: cost.

There is an acknowledgement at Arsenal that signing Isak would wipe out the vast majority of their budget - and with other positions to strengthen, a deal for the 25-year-old may be unlikely.

Newcastle maintain Isak, who has three years left on his contract, is not for sale.

Should they qualify for the Champions League, that would add another layer of difficulty for any club with genuine designs on signing him.

But, as ever in any marketplace, money talks and Arsenal have not closed the door on a move for Isak just yet.

Arsenal have alternative targets to Isak - namely RB Leipzig's Sesko and Sporting's Gyokeres.

Sesko is a long-term target and was close to joining the club last summer. 

Arsenal enquired again in January, but the German club were adamant they had no intention of selling and the Gunners did not want to antagonise them before a potential negotiation this summer.

Slovenia international Sesko has scored 26 goals this season - already an improvement on the 23 he hit last year. At 21, he fits the ideal age profile for Arsenal in terms of financial and technical growth.

But the appointment of Berta has resulted in Gyokeres' stock rising, with sources in recent weeks indicating there is considerable internal backing for a move for the Swede, despite much of the groundwork having been completed on a deal for Sesko.

Both players have release clauses, but the indications are their clubs are willing to negotiate lower fees.

At this stage, sources suggest Gyokeres, who has scored 38 league goals this season, is the most economical signing of the two.

But prior to Berta's arrival there were concerns whether Gyokeres' form in Portugal would translate to top-level performances in the Premier League.

Similarly, the fact he will turn 27 before next season presents a financial dilemma given the likely outlay.

Arsenal are also looking to sign a winger, with Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams a genuine target.

The Spain international has a reported 58m euro (Â£49m) release clause, but his wages would make him one of the biggest earners at the club. 

Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens has also been liked with the Gunners.

Zubimendi was widely thought to have been targeted by Liverpool last summer

Much of the groundwork to strengthen the midfield has already been done. 

Martin Zubimendi is expected to join from Real Sociedad - a deal largely executed by former sporting director Edu and Jason Ayto, who took the role on an interim basis following his predecessor's departure in November.

Zubimendi, 26, will replace Jorginho, who is set to join Brazilian side Flamengo before the Club World Cup. 

Whether Arsenal look to sign another midfielder will depend how contract talks develop with Thomas Partey.

The 31-year-old Ghana international seemed likely to leave at the end of his contract next month, but Berta's arrival has signalled a change of direction and Partey is being offered the opportunity to stay in north London.

Defensively, the priorities are to secure first-choice central pairing William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes to new contracts.

The future of Saliba is particularly key for Arsenal to resolve amid speculation Real Madrid have an interest in the France international.

Gabriel, meanwhile, has been the subject of interest from Saudi Arabia. 

Arsenal are among the clubs to have explored the possibility of signing Bournemouth centre-back Dean Huijsen, who has a Â£50m release clause, and Berta has held talks with intermediaries over alternative options, which lends itself to assuming there is not certainty Saliba or Gabriel will remain.

The Gunners may also be in the market for a back-up goalkeeper, and have held talks over a move for Espanyol's Joan Garcia.

In addition to talks with Partey, Saliba and Gabriel, Arsenal are moving to agree a new contract with attacker Bukayo Saka.

In March, BBC Sport revealed the club's intention to open formal talks with the England international.

That process has now begun, with early discussions said to be positive amid optimism agreement will be reached on a deal that would make Saka, 23, one of the best-paid players in the Premier League.

The club have also put improved contracts for Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri towards the top of their agenda. Talks with the 18-year-old academy graduates are ongoing, with Berta taking the lead.

The future of Leandro Trossard also needs resolving. The 30-year-old Belgium international, who has played a key role this season, is out of contract next summer.

Trossard has held talks over a new deal but there is yet to be an announcement over any agreement. It may therefore be a consideration to sell Trossard, who has attracted interest in Saudi Arabia, to avoid losing the forward for nothing next year.

Arsenal will look to supplement their spending by selling a clutch of fringe players.

Their intention to listen to offers for Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus has been delayed by the knee injury sustained by the 28-year-old in January.

But the club will look to offload Oleksandr Zinchenko, while fellow left-back Kieran Tierney will also leave. 

Forward Raheem Sterling, on loan from Chelsea, will head back to Stamford Bridge, and defender Nuno Tavares plus midfielders Fabio Vieira and Albert Lokonga could also leave.

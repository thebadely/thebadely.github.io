It has been recently reported that Scotland were superb as they swept aside Wales in their World Cup opener

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Scotland v Fiji

Venue: Salford Community Stadium Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 14:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport online, Radio 5 Live Sports Extra 2 and BBC Sounds

Scotland head coach Bryan Easson says his team have not yet peaked as they prepare to face Fiji at the World Cup on Saturday, following their stunning opening win over Wales.

In a match widely-tipped to be a close encounter, the Scots destroyed Wales last weekend with a superb six-try display to take control of their own destiny in Pool B.

A victory over Fiji in Salford on Saturday could seal Scotland's passage into the quarter-finals, and Easson believes they can eclipse the high watermark they set in their first match.

"I think on both sides of the ball everybody was just on top of their game, but I think there's more in us," Easson said.

"We felt when we reviewed the game that we left two or three chances out there as well.

"We probably could have put a little bit more pressure on them, so we're certainly not the finished article."

Elis Martin is set to make her first World Cup start against Fiji

Easson has made just one change to last week's starting XV as hooker Elis Martin replaces Lana Skeldon, who was a doubt for the tournament because of an ankle injury but played 47 minutes against Wales.

Skeldon misses out entirely on the Scots' second game, with Molly Wright named as the replacement hooker.

Francesca McGhie lines up on the left wing following her stunning hat-trick against Wales, while the other try-scorers from that game - scrum-half Leia Brebner-Holden, number eight Evie Gallagher and centre Emma Orr also retain their spots.

There is a six-two split on the bench, with lock Adelle Ferrie and prop Anne Young in line for World Cup debuts.

Number eight Jade Konkel, who was among the replacements against Wales, is not involved.

Fiji - ranked 14th in the world - were beaten 65-7 by Canada in their opening match.

"We've got to respect Fiji like we respected Wales, and that's the way we've treated this week," Easson said.

"They have obviously got that southern hemisphere flair. They've got threats right across.

"We understand their ability to offload, their ability to run hard, [they are a] very physical side as well, but they've also got a northern hemisphere coach who's brought a little bit more structure into the game as well.

"We've looked at the opportunities as well. We've prepared for this game as well as we have for Wales and we've certainly given them the same respect."

Scotland: Rollie, Lloyd, Orr, Thomson, McGhie, Nelson, Brebner-Holden; Bartlett, Martin, Clarke, Wassell, Bonar, Malcolm, McLachlan, Gallagher

Replacements: Wright, Young, Cockburn, Ferrie, Donaldson, Stewart, Mattinson, Blacklock

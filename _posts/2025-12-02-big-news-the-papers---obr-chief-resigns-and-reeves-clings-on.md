Let's dive into the details: Most of the papers focus on Monday's resignation of the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, or as the Daily Mail describes him, "the fall guy" for the chancellor's "Budget lies". 

Sources tell the i Paper that Richard Hughes could have survived the OBR's accidental leak, but his relationship with the Treasury had "tanked" after he "undermined" Rachel Reeves' position on the state of the public finances. According to the Times, the pair were "barely on speaking terms" in the lead up to his resignation, a period described by the Financial Times as "a moment of high tension".

Ministers are hoping, the Guardian says, that Mr Hughes' departure will "draw a line" under what it calls the "chaos" surrounding the Budget. But the paper says Ms Reeves "remains under pressure". The Daily Telegraph describes her as "battling to save her political career". 

One government insider tells the Mail that she is "radioactive" and "contaminating everyone around her". The prime minister has "lashed himself" to the chancellor's "lies", one minister is quoted as saying. "There's no way out of this for either of them".

As Sir Keir Starmer defended his chancellor in a speech, the Daily Express claims he "sparked fury" by "vowing to appease Brussels". It highlights the prime minister's comments that the UK should build a closer relationship with the EU, with the paper saying that he "blamed Brexit for the disastrous economy under Labour". The Daily Mirror quotes him as criticising "wild promises" which were made to people, and not fulfilled.

The Sun reports that a former England and Premier League footballer has been arrested on suspicion of attempted rape. Sources describe to the paper how the unnamed man was detained at passport control at Stansted Airport. Essex Police says a man has been bailed while inquiries continue.

The Justice Secretary David Lammy sets out his case in the Daily Telegraph for proposed changes to jury trials due to be outlined later. He cites the Magna Carta, writing that "if its authors saw the delays in our courts today, they would not urge us to cling rigidly to tradition". But the Times reports that he has dropped the more "radical" part of his plan, to scrap jury trials in all cases except murder, rape and manslaughter.

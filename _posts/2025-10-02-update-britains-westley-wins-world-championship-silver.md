According to new developments, Ryan Westley finished runner-up to France's Nicolas Green

Great Britain's Ryan Westley clinched the third individual Canoe Slalom World Championship medal of his career by winning silver in the men's C1 in Sydney.

The 32-year-old finished 0.9 seconds behind France's Nicolas Green to add to the silver he won in Rio in 2018 and the bronze he earned in London in 2015.

"Everything went really well," said Westley.

"Unfortunately, there was one other guy on the start line who was a bit better than me but there's not much I can do about that.

"I really enjoyed my final run. I took a little bit of time at the top but once that happened, I felt really locked in."

It was a second medal of the championships for Westley, who claimed a C1 team silver alongside team-mates Adam Burgess and Luc Royle.

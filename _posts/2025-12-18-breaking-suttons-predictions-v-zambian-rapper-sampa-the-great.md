According to new developments, Aston Villa have won nine games in a row in all competitions, but can they reach double figures by beating Manchester United on Sunday?

"Villa have gone behind in three of those games and haven't kept a clean sheet in their past four matches," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. 

"But they have been so attacking and Morgan Rogers is absolutely flying. They just never seem to lie down."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 17, he takes on Zambian musician and rapper Sampa the Great.

Sampa the Great's new single, Can't Hold Us, is out now and is included in the EAFC 26 video game.

Another Sampa the Great track, Let Me Be Great, was featured on the Fifa 23 soundtrack. She met up with the Zambia squad at a training camp before Afcon 2025 and has a created a special football shirt to celebrate the national team and Zamrock

The Africa Cup of Nations begins on Sunday and Sampa is looking forward to seeing how Zambia, the 2012 winners, get on in Morocco.

"I have my fingers crossed because I am still holding on to that win that we had," she told BBC Sport. "It was just so memorable.

"I have no idea how we are going to do this time, but I am very excited, and very hopeful about our chances. We've just had a restructure and appointed a new coach too [Moses Sichone] so I am also hoping that can push us more.

"It is not just Zambia who I will be looking out for, though. I don't think people know how much of an Afcon fan I am, and how much rivalry I have with my friends - especially when their teams get knocked out!

"Afcon is huge for us when it comes around and everything else kind of shuts down while everyone just focuses on the tournament. 

"It is such an exciting time when the whole of Africa kind of bands together as a continent to celebrate."

Chris Sutton and Sampa the Great were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. 

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Newcastle 2-2 Chelsea

Both teams won in the Carabao Cup in midweek, but it feels like Newcastle's squad is being stretched more at the moment.

There is a worry for Chelsea too, though, in terms of what is happening with Enzo Maresca.

He is obviously unhappy about something, and if there is some sort of infighting going on, or if he feels he is not being backed properly, then that does not bode well regardless of what happens on the pitch.

I certainly don't think Maresca's issues are with his team's performances. His side are very principled in the way they play and they will cause Newcastle problems.

I am still going to go with the Magpies to win it, though. 

I usually back them at home anyway, but this is prediction is mainly based on Chelsea's recent record at St James' Park, which is poor - they have not got anything there since 2021.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: Both teams are quite inconsistent - this is going to be close. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Bournemouth 1-1 Burnley

Both of these sides are without a win in seven league games but Burnley's problems are deeper because they have lost every time during that run.

So, their boss Scott Parker really needs a positive result against his former club.

We have had callers on 6-0-6 suggesting his time is up at Turf Moor, but I think that is harsh because they have still been competitive despite all those defeats.

I always thought they would struggle this season after getting promoted and I am sure their fans did too but, as I have said many times already, because Sunderland are doing so well, it means Clarets fans are asking: 'Why can't that be us?'

Bournemouth were second on 26 October, but are now 13th after taking only three points in total from those seven games.

The Cherries' 4-4 draw at Old Trafford on Monday was an extraordinary game and proved again what I already thought - that they have goals in them.

I can see Burnley giving them a good game too, but this is where Andoni Iraola's side get back to winning ways.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Sampa the Great's prediction: Bournemouth drew 4-4 last time? That is a lot of goals! I am going for them to get more here too... Burnley have had a lot of losses! They will be motivated and I always think the underdog can surprise people, but not this time - Burnley are going to lose again! 4-2

AI's prediction: 2-1

Brighton 0-0 Sunderland

Sunderland are an amazing team, and winning last week's Wear-Tyne derby is just the latest high for them in what has been an a brilliant season.

The Black Cats are on 26 points after 16 games, and have already beaten Leicester's total from 38 games last season - they were relegated with 25 points in 18th place.

That's an extraordinary achievement. I know they are losing a few players to Afcon, but that would only be a big problem if they were languishing near the bottom of the table.

Instead this just feels like an opportunity for the players coming in to try to maintain their momentum. Regis le Bris and his team will be full of confidence too, although this is a tricky trip for them to the south coast.

Brighton are a real Jekyll and Hyde side at the moment, but I always feel they will do well at home - they have only lost once there this season.

I watched the Seagulls at Anfield last week. They should have scored, but didn't... and lost.

This time? My instinct still tells me to go with Brighton at Amex Stadium, but Sunderland are going to push them very close.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Sampa the Great's prediction: I can't pick a winner here. 3-3

AI's prediction: 2-0

Man City 3-0 West Ham

This just feels like it will be a routine win for Manchester City, who have won their past six games in all competitions and are building real momentum.

West Ham, in contrast, are in the bottom three and facing one heck of a scrap to stay in the Premier League.

It hardly helps the Hammers that all the teams immediately above them picked up at least a point last weekend while they were losing at home to Aston Villa.

I do think their performances have improved under Nuno Espirito Santo, but they really need some points to go with that, and this is not a game where I think that is particularly likely.

I just can't look past City for the win, because I don't see West Ham keeping them out.

What a goal Rayan Cherki scored against Brentford in the EFL Cup on Wednesday - I got a bit of flak on the Monday Night Club, and on social media too, for agreeing with Pep Guardiola that he needs to cut out the rabonas and use his left foot instead, but he is a huge talent and he has has kicked City on.

City have kept three clean sheets in a row in the Premier League too, which surprises me a bit - and makes me think they will concede here, but this will still be a comfortable afternoon for them.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: I think there will be tears for West Ham. City are going to take this one. 4-3

AI's prediction: 3-0

Wolves 0-2 Brentford

What a miserable Christmas party the Wolves players must have had. They are not staying up, not a chance.

They pushed Arsenal close with their rearguard action at Emirates Stadium last weekend, but still lost in the end.

Rob Edwards needs something, anything, to go his way after five defeats from five games and maybe - just maybe! - he will get a crumb of comfort on Saturday.

The reason I say that is because Brentford's away record is woeful, with seven defeats and just one win in the Premier League so far.

I still think the Bees might nick it, but instead I am going for Wolves to get a point and bring a tiny bit of Christmas cheer to Molineux, although I am not sure how long it will last.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: Wolves have waited a long time for a win but I feel like they can take this one. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Tottenham 1-2 Liverpool

It is normally a good game when these two sides meet but, going into it this time, I suppose both sets of supporters are unsure how their team will perform.

At Tottenham, poor Thomas Frank is having a tough time of it.

He was so furious after their defeat at Nottingham Forest that he said it feels like there is a hurricane inside him. 

I can understand why he is so angry, because Spurs were so limp and offered so little in that game.

If you look at where they are in the table, 11th, then they are doing all right but it is their performances that are lacking something. They have never really found any fluency under Frank.

They did win their past two home games and Frank can cling on to that but, the way Spurs fans are, they are probably thinking: 'It was only against Brentford and Slavia Prague.'

Winning this game would be far more of a statement. 

Even though Mohamed Salah has left for Afcon, there are still questions over Liverpool too.

Brighton had their moments last week and it was not entirely comfortable for Arne Slot's side, although I thought Hugo Ekitike was excellent.

Liverpool could have another problem at right-back because Joe Gomez came off injured in that game. Dominik Szoboszlai has been their best player, in midfield, so if he recovers from the knock he picked up against the Seagulls but has to slot back in there, it would be a bit of a blow.

I certainly don't trust Spurs to turn up, but I don't think you can fully trust Liverpool again either, especially away from home in the Premier League. 

Because of all of that, I can't back either of them to win it.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: Both teams are under a bit of pressure for a win. 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Everton 0-1 Arsenal

Arsenal got very lucky with the way they beat Wolves last time out, but is that the mark of champions, that they can find a way to get over the line?

The Gunners have been ugly at times this season but they still get the job done and it might be a similar story here.

I can't see them losing this game but they will need to find a way to win it, against an Everton side who have won four of their past six matches.

What might help Mikel Arteta out is that most of the Merseysiders' best players might be missing for this one.

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish are both injury doubts, while Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye are at Afcon with Senegal.

That's a stinker for Toffees boss David Moyes, because Ndiaye in particular is so influential - and he is in my fantasy football team too.

To be without all four of them would be a massive blow. I am not a medical expert but, if Dewsbury-Hall or Grealish have hurt their hamstrings in any way, which is what has been reported, then there is no way they will be fit for Saturday. 

Because of that, I am going for a narrow Gunners win to make it a 'Feliz Navidad' ['Merry Christmas' in Spanish] for Arteta, with his team top of the league.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: Everton are going to surprise people. Arsenal only just beat Wolves, and this will be close too. 3-4

AI's prediction: 1-2

Leeds 4-1 Crystal Palace

If Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin had hit this run of form a little bit earlier, he would have been my vote for Sports Personality of the Year.

Calvert-Lewin has scored four goals in four games and his leap to score against Brentford last week was incredible.

Fair play to Leeds boss Daniel Farke too. I've said it before, but I am delighted for him. 

He was written off a few weeks ago as not being able to manage in the Premier League and it felt as if some people were waiting for him to be sacked. He has proved them all wrong. 

Farke's side are always a handful at home and will relish the challenge of getting another good result on Saturday, but I can see this being a very close contest.

Palace are the counter-attack kings and they are especially effective away from home - they have won their past three matches on the road and have the best away record in the Premier League this season with five wins, a draw and only two defeats from eight games so far.

So, do I go with the energy of Leeds or back streetwise Palace? 

I am tempted to go with Oliver Glasner's side to nick it but they have got a Europa Conference League game to contend with on Thursday, which has stretched them in the past. 

They are going to miss Ismaila Sarr, too, who has gone to Afcon with Senegal, so on that basis I am going for another draw instead.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: Leeds to edge this - just about! 3-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

Villa Park, 16:30

Manchester United are still a bit of an oddity but they are entertaining, you'd give them that. They have scored eight goals in their past two games.

United have some sort of hoodoo over Villa, who have only beaten them in one of their past 26 Premier League meetings - Unai Emery's first game in charge, in November 2022.

I usually think that sort of history in a fixture holds a lot of weight when it comes to making my predictions.

But Villa have already beaten Arsenal this month, so why can't they beat United? I think they can. 

Also, for Villa to have won nine games in a row is just unbelievable.

I am a dreamer in life, as you will all know, and I want Emery to make it 10 wins in a row. Nothing against United, but I am going for another Villa victory.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Sampa the Great's prediction: Villa are favourites here, everything is working for them at the moment and they will have lots of confidence. 3-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

Craven Cottage, 20:00

Fulham are another team who I usually fancy to win at home, but they have been depleted by Afcon call-ups.

Samuel Chukwueze has been a really good impact player recently but Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey have been the heartbeat of Marco Silva's side this season, and all three will be missed.

As for Nottingham Forest, they are on fire with six wins in eight games in all competitions. Maybe 'Dyche-ball' is going under the radar a bit, because they are doing very well.

Bassey got the winner in this fixture last season but, as I mentioned, he is not here and this is a very different Forest side too.

I can see this being a very tight affair. I was looking for a reason to say my boyhood team Forest will win, but Harry Wilson will score for Fulham and they can't keep a clean sheet, so it has 1-1 written all over it.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Sampa the Great's prediction: This is a high stakes game - a win would be big for both teams. I hope there are more goals here, too! 3-2

AI's prediction: 2-1

Chris got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 matches in week 16, giving him 40 points.

The BBC readers fared better, with five correct results and no exact scores for a total of 50 points, while Chris's guest, England gaming star Daniel 'Stingray' Ray, also got five correct results but with one exact score, for a tally of 80 points.

But, for the second successive week, the weekly win went to AI. It got seven correct results, with two exact scores, finishing with 130 points.

England's players are operating a fines system which punishes infractions against squad rules by forcing the offenders to film TikTok dances.

The day after Saturday's 33-19 victory over New Zealand, wing Tommy Freeman, who missed the game with a hamstring injury, published a video of himself, Fin Smith, Henry Pollock and Freddie Steward performing a synchronised dance routine set to Irish country music.

Freeman's video, captioned "Post game feels", has garnered seven million views on the social media platform.

Centre Henry Slade said that the quartet spent "about 45 minutes", external coordinating their routine in his hotel room.

While it is not clear if Freeman's video was imposed or motivated by joy after only England's ninth win over the All Blacks in a 120-year rivalry, Elliot Daly, who is part of the team's fines committee alongside Jamie George, said similar footage exists of other players.

"There are a few fines going around that are TikTok dances," he told the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.

"If you do something wrong, you do a TikTok video. Although it doesn't have to go on TikTok."

Steve Borthwick is one of those relieved about that final get-out clause. The head coach has been roped in for a cameo on one video that has, so far at least, not been shown beyond the team room.

"There has been a lot of laughter, a lot of very bad dancing - I think that is one of the better ones," Borthwick said of Freeman, Steward, Pollock and Smith's effort.

"I was asked to make a guest appearance in someone else's TikTok dance, so there was a very limited role to play in one.

"The team saw it and that is as far as it is going!"

England take on Argentina on Sunday in their final match of 2025, seeking an 11th straight victory.

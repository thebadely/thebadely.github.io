Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A charity supporting homeless people has said it plans to hold weekly women-only sessions to offer a "safe and comfortable environment".

Light Project Peterborough (LLP) runs The Garden House in the city centre - a respite day centre for rough sleepers offering advice.

The charity said about 20% of people they supported were women, with a rise in the number of female visitors over the past two years.

Services manager Paddy Berryman said a lot of vulnerable women coming to The Garden House felt "intimidated" by the number of men at the centre.

He said there would be female volunteers offering advice.

"They can seek help without fear," he explained.

"Women, especially those fleeing abuse, have anxiety or have been through trauma  [so] don't feel safe coming into a space dominant with men."

The charity says it offers healthcare support, housing and offered use of a shower.

"It is about recognising what will help them engage with services with a view to helping them move forward."

According to Peterborough City Council's latest homelessness report, there were 24 rough sleepers counted in the city in 2023.

The LLP said it had experienced "a challenging" summer, in hot conditions, with 110 new people attending the centre between May and July.

"We have given out more water, sun cream, and ice lollies than any previous year," added Mr Berryman.

To manage demand, the LLP said it had recruited two new project workers.

Mr Berrymen says the charity is "building up" to the Great Eastern Run in Peterborough, for which it is a charity partner.

"We are close to hitting our target of 50 runners and there's still time for people to sign up," he continued.

Let's dive into the details: Fraser Forster's last senior appearance was on 29 December 2024

Bournemouth have signed former Tottenham and Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster on a six-month deal. 

The 37-year-old arrives at Vitality Stadium as back-up to first-choice stopper Djordje Petrovic after an injury to Will Dennis.  

Forster, who won the last of his six caps for England in 2016, has been a free agent since leaving Spurs last summer when his contract expired. 

"The opportunity arose and, for me, it was one that I couldn't say no to," he said.

"I am absolutely delighted. It's happened pretty quickly but I am delighted to be here and be a part of it.

"I am looking forward to helping the team and the squad, and contributing however I can for the rest of the season.

"You can really see the trajectory and the ambition of the club, and I think that was a very attractive thing for me."

Bournemouth, who are on a winless run stretching 10 top-flight matches back to 26 October, host Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday, with Forster expected to be among the substitutes.

Earlier on Friday, the Cherries confirmed Mexico right-back Julian Araujo, 24, had completed a loan move to Celtic.

Let's dive into the details: Britain won silver at last year's European finals behind Ukraine

Great Britain's men produced a solid performance to win team gold at the European gymastics championship in Leipzig, Germany.

Olympic medallists Jake Jarman and Harry Hepworth, double European floor champion Luke Whitehouse plus Jonas Rushworth and Jamie Lewis - two newcomers to the senior squad - combined for a winning score of 247.528 points.

That total was enough to see off the challenges of Switzerland and Italy and earn Britain a first gold in the event since 2022.

Jarman, who was part of the quartet who won that title in Munich, told BBC Sport: "I'm incredibly proud of this team. It was a new team coming into this and I was a bit unsure how we'd get on together, but from day one it just seemed like the chemistry of the team came together so seamlessly.

"I was just trying to tell them to enjoy it. We do all the hard work back in the gym at home and when it comes to the day you don't want to walk away from a competition wishing you'd enjoyed it more."

Rushworth, 19, was making his senior debut for GB.

He told BBC Sport: "It's a privilege, I feel blessed to be in this team.

"There's no better group of lads to be here with. The experience was immense and I'm just excited for the future."

The team event also served as qualification for the men's all-around and apparatus finals, while the mixed team final takes place on Wednesday.

Italy won the women's team event, external on Monday, with Great Britain finishing in sixth place.

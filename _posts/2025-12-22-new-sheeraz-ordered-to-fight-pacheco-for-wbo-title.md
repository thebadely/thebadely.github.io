Experts revealed that Hamzah Sheeraz has won 22 of his 23 fights

Britain's Hamzah Sheeraz has been ordered to fight Diego Pacheco for the vacant WBO super-middleweight title following Terence Crawford's retirement.

American Crawford left the sport last week, adding he has "nothing else left to prove" after beating Saul 'Canelo' Alvaraz in September to become the first man in the modern era to hold undisputed titles in three weight divisions.

In retirement Crawford, who won all 42 of his professional fights, vacated his belts, with the WBO instructing Sheeraz to fight American Pacheco for its title.

The bout gives 26-year-old Sheeraz a second option after he was previously ordered by the WBC to fight Christian Mbilli for their vacant super-middleweight title.

The sanctioning body stripped Crawford of his belt before his retirement because he did not pay sanctioning fees.

Sheeraz's promoters Queensberry and Pacheco's Matchroom have 20 days to agree on the terms of a fight but if they cannot reach an agreement they must proceed to purse bids according to WBO rules.

Sheeraz drew with WBC middleweight champion Carlos Adames last February in an underwhelming performance over 12 rounds, before beating Edgar Berlanga in July.

He is unbeaten in 23 fights, while 24-year-old Pacheco has won all 25 of his bouts.

England flanker Marlie Packer admits she got "emotional" at the prospect of captaining the Red Roses again in Saturday's Women's Rugby World Cup warm-up game against Spain.

The 35-year-old was replaced as England skipper by Zoe Aldcroft in January after two seasons in the role.

Despite head coach John Mitchell opting for Aldcroft to lead the side into this month's World Cup, 110-cap Packer is still vice-captain and will skipper the side in Aldcroft's absence in Leicester this weekend.

"What is better than playing in a home World Cup? Whatever role I play in this I am going to give my all. That starts this weekend against Spain," Packer said.

"Mitch had a conversation quite early in pre-season about my squad role in the first couple of games.

"When he said 'I am going to name you as captain' [for the first warm-up game], I got a little bit emotional.

"Zoe has been doing an amazing job and you just don't know if you are going to get that nod again."

Packer last played for the Red Roses on 19 April against Scotland at Mattioli Woods Welford Road Stadium, where the game against Spain will be played.

Mitchell's side also play France in Mont-de-Marsan next Saturday in their final warm-up game before kicking the tournament off at Sunderland's Stadium of Light against the United States on 22 August.

Despite being one of only four World Cup winners in the squad remaining from 2014, Packer faces tough competition to start the opener in the back row.

Maddie Feaunati, 23, started instead of Packer for England's Six Nations Grand Slam decider against France in April, while Sadia Kabeya, 23, has also played ahead of the former England captain.

Off the field has also been busy for Packer, with the vice-captain proposing to England team-mate Rosie Galligan.

A city break to Bath a few months ago was where Galligan spotted the ring she wanted, but Packer said it was too expensive and used the upcoming World Cup as an excuse.

Packer then proceeded to sneakily call up and secure the purchase.

"That same week I got it sized up and ordered," she said.

"I was going to do it on the week we had off after Treviso. I spoke to her dad and the rest of the family about coming over on that day.

"She went and got her nails done and asked if she minded if she got her hair done. It was all set up perfectly.

"I did it where we first started speaking at a reservoir just outside Guildford.

"She was on her way and I texted her to meet me at this location. It was perfect and it couldn't have been done any better. She was super surprised."

Upcoming family weddings in 2026 has left 2027 as the likely wedding date, but Packer is aware of the British and Irish Lions' first women's tour that September, to New Zealand.

Galligan, 28, is in her prime years and will likely be in the mix for a squad spot.

However, Parker, who is 36 in October, is not convinced she will be in contention by then.

"With the back row at the Red Roses and at every other nation, I think I would only be going to the Lions if I was water girl," Packer joked. "I would want to be there in some capacity, but playing in 2027 there will be some really incredible world class players.

"Rosie might want to play in it, so it [the wedding] will probably be after the Lions tour."

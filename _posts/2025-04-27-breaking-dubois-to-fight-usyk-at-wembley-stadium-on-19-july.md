Let's dive into the details: Daniel Dubois (left) has claimed 21 of his 22 victories by knockout

Daniel Dubois and Oleksandr Usyk will fight to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion at Wembley Stadium on 19 July.

Briton Dubois is the IBF champion, with Usyk holding the WBA (Super), WBO and WBC belts.

Usyk is undefeated in 23 fights and beat Dubois, 27, via a ninth-round stoppage in August 2023.

The 38-year-old Ukrainian made history in May 2024 when he beat Tyson Fury to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion of the four-belt era.

Usyk, who was also undisputed at cruiserweight, vacated the IBF belt prior to his rematch with Fury in December.

Dubois was upgraded to IBF champion as a result and successfully defended the belt against Anthony Joshua last September.

He was set to make a second defence against Joseph Parker in February but illness forced him to withdraw from the bout in fight week.

"This is the fight I wanted and demanded and now I get my chance for revenge," said Dubois.

"I should have won the first fight and was denied by the judgement of the referee, so I will make no mistake this time around in front of my people at the national stadium in my home city.

"I am a superior and more dangerous fighter now and Usyk will find this out for himself."

No British boxer has held the undisputed heavyweight title in the four-belt era, and the last Briton to be undisputed heavyweight champion was Lennox Lewis in 1999.

Usyk last competed in December when he earned a second win against Fury.

"I'm grateful to God for the opportunity to once again fight for the undisputed championship," said Usyk.

"Thank you, Daniel, for taking care of my IBF belt - now I want it back."

Dubois fired himself into superstar status when he stopped Joshua at Wembley Stadium. The Londoner has risen from defeats to mould himself into a world champion with a seemingly unshakeable confidence.

Usyk, on the other hand, has made a career of breaking British hearts and will aim to do it again when he meets Dubois.

Having swept two-time heavyweight world champion Joshua aside, Dubois now has his sights on felling another of the old guard in the Ukrainian. 

But were it any other fighter, an 11-year age gap would prompt discussions about a passing-of-the-torch moment, but such is Usyk's pedigree he will be clear favourite.

The fight will represent a full-circle moment for Dubois, whose mental fortitude was called into question after his loss to Usyk almost three years ago in Poland.

There was also the small matter of the controversy of the low blow as Dubois was mere centimetres away from knocking down Usyk and perhaps finishing the fight. 

There are not many who would have predicted Dubois would be the one to knock Usyk off his perch - that was supposed to be Fury - but in July, on home turf, Dubois will have the chance to banish demons and claim his spot at the top of the heavyweight mountain.

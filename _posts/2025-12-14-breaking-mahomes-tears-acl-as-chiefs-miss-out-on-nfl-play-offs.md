Experts revealed that Patrick Mahomes has led the Kansas City Chiefs to five of the past six Super Bowls

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a major knee injury as the Kansas City Chiefs were ruled out of the NFL play-offs for the first time since the 2014 season.

Sunday's 16-13 loss at home to the Los Angeles Chargers means that, despite having three regular season games remaining, the Chiefs have already been eliminated from play-off contention.

Mahomes, 30, was forced off with less than two minutes left and his team later confirmed the three-time Super Bowl winner has torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee.

"Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts," he said on X., external

"But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.

"Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever."

Kansas City's third loss in a row - and fifth in six games - left them with a 6-8 record this season and could mark the end of an NFL dynasty.

Head coach Andy Reid has led Kansas City to the play-offs in each of the past 10 seasons and to the Super Bowl in five of the past six.

The Chiefs won the NFL's championship game in 2020, 2023 and 2024, and were denied the first Super Bowl three-peat last February.

Mahomes became their starting quarterback in 2018 and has reached at least the AFC Championship game in each of the past seven seasons, a run bettered only by Tom Brady's New England Patriots (2011-2018) 

The Chiefs have also produced the second-longest post-season run in NFL history behind the Patriots (2009-2019).

Travis Kelce's contract runs to the end of this season

Kansas City led 13-3 late in the second quarter of Sunday's game but the Chargers fought back with 13 unanswered points to beat their divisional rivals.

Mahomes, who has twice been named the season's Most Valuable Player, was trying to put together a game-winning drive when he injured his left knee in a tackle after scrambling towards the sideline.

He needed treatment on the field and was being helped down the tunnel when back-up quarterback Gardner Minshew threw an interception with 20 seconds left, with the Chiefs in position to potentially tie the score with a long field goal.

Mahomes underwent an MRI on Sunday evening, which confirmed a torn ACL, the first serious injury of his nine-year NFL career.

"Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options," the team said in a statement.

Travis Kelce has been a regular starter since the 2014 season and is one of six players to win three Super Bowls with the Chiefs - one of five still with the team.

The 36-year-old tight end, who is engaged to music superstar Taylor Swift, said last month that he would wait until after the season to decide whether he will retire.

Here’s what you need to know: Katie Boulter had a career-high ranking of 23 in 2024

Katie Boulter has turned to a former coach of Maria Sharapova as she attempts to climb back up the world rankings.

American Michael Joyce, 52, has joined Boulter in Auckland, where the former British number one has a main draw wildcard for next week's ASB Classic.

The two have agreed terms for the rest of the year, which will come into effect if neither has a change of heart in New Zealand or at this month's Australian Open.

Joyce spent six years as part of Sharapova's team, and was alongside her when she won the US Open and the Australian Open and became world number one.

He reached a high of 64 in the world as a player, but is best known for his coaching prowess.

Joyce has also worked with the two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka, Britain's Johanna Konta and most recently Ashlyn Krueger - an American who made her top 30 debut last June.

Boulter split from Biljana Veselinovic late last year after a three-year partnership in which she won three WTA titles.

The 29-year-old is currently the British number four having fallen out of the world's top 100.

Boulter has won only three tour level matches since Wimbledon and tore an abductor in her final event of last year in Hong Kong.

As a result she just missed out on a main draw place at the Australian Open. She is currently the third alternate, and without sufficient withdrawals, will need to win through qualifying at Melbourne Park.

But there is still plenty Boulter wishes to achieve, as she made clear in an interview with BBC Sport in November.

"Going forward with a new coach, one thing I'm very clear on is that they are going to be someone who has a lot of experience in how to make it to the very top level of this game," she said.

"I've been ranked as high as 23 and I know I can get back there. I don't think my level has gone anywhere, I think the consistency needs to improve.

"My goal is not to be ranked 50, 40, 30, 20 - we've been there. The goal is to be inside 20."

On Instagram, Boulter welcomed 2026 as "the best year of her life" - she is due to marry Australia's world number seven Alex de Minaur.

And she made it clear she will not be mourning the year just gone.

"Adios 2025. Don't let the door hit you on the way out," she posted.

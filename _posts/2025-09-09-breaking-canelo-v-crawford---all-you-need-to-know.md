Canelo v Crawford is a fight for legacy - Ward

Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez takes on Terence Crawford in what could be one of the best fights of the year on Saturday in Las Vegas.

Crawford steps up two weights to face the undisputed super-middleweight champion, aiming to become the first male fighter to win an undisputed title in three weight classes in the four-belt era.

Alvarez, 35, is for the first time in his illustious 67-fight career being cast as the old guard, despite Crawford being two years older.

Will Crawford make his case to become boxing's pound-for-pound number one? Or will Alvarez maintain his undefeated record at super-middleweight?

The super-fight will be staged at NFL side Las Vegas Raiders' 65,000-capacity Allegiant Stadium.

Crawford and Alvarez have two of the best records in boxing.

Crawford, 37, is a two-weight undisputed champion and is unbeaten in 41 professional fights. 

He has held world titles in four weight classes from lightweight to light-middleweight and was undisputed at light-middlweight and welterweight.

The Nebraska native has 31 knockouts on his record and is known for a punishing, spiteful style and an ability to go through the gears quickly when needed.

Crawford has big names on his resume including Amir Khan, Errol Spence Jr, Ricky Burns and Shawn Porter.

The dominant manner in which he beat domestic rival Spence in 2023 confirmed his status as a generational talent. 

Crawford moved up to light-middleweight in preparation for this fight, winning another world title, but faces a fighter who is a natural super-middleweight.

Alvarez made his professional debut aged 15 and has racked up 67 bouts since then. 

He has won world titles in four weight classes and is the only male fighter to hold all four belts in the super-middleweight division.

He has never been beaten at that weight. His losses came against Floyd Mayweather at light-middleweight in 2013 and to Dmitry Bivol at light-heavyweight in 2022.

Alvarez has beaten Gennady Golovkin, Sergey Kovalev, Callum Smith, Miguel Cotto and Billy Joe Saunders.

There is no big height difference but Crawford does have a reach advantage of 74 inches to Alvarez's 70 inches.

A lot has been made of Alvarez's potentially slowing down after 520 rounds under his belt. Crawford has fought 245 in comparison.

But the weight difference could be a deciding factor in this fight. Crawford has fought as low as lightweight, albeit last in 2014, while Alvarez has twice stepped up to light-heavyweight.

In a fight where both men might be evenly matched in terms of ability, the difference in weight could well be the decider.

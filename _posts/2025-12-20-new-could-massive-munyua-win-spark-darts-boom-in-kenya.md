Here’s what you need to know: David Munyua will face Kevin Doets in the second round of the PDC World Championship

You know you have done something special when you get a message from your country's president to congratulate you.

Kenya's David Munyua was the recipient of exactly that from William Ruto following his historic win at the PDC World Championship on Thursday.

"As you advance to the next stage, know that the nation stands behind you," Ruto wrote., external "Bring the trophy home."

Debutant Munyua produced one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history by beating world number 18 Mike de Decker in the first round.

The 30-year-old was two sets down on his Alexandra Palace debut before coming back to win 3-2 against the 2024 World Grand Prix winner.

"That was massive for everyone," said Dann Karori, co-founder of Sirua Darts, the official affiliate to the Kenya Darts Association.

"It's been great for the country and for the continent because we also have players coming from the near countries. All of them are happy to be part of this journey. This is massive."

Munyua had never left Africa before travelling to London for the World Championship. At home, he works as a full-time vet.

The scene of his shock win was also a stone's throw away from where his beloved Chelsea play their home matches at Stamford Bridge.

It is understood Munyua bought his match-winning, Cam Crabtree-design darts from a local shop a couple of days before taking to the famous stage for the first time.

In a five-set thriller with De Decker, Munyua showed some impressive dance moves, plenty of passion and even had a very close encounter with the Alexandra Palace wasp.

"He's very animated here as well. We actually had to tell him to tone it down until he wins a set," Karori explained.

"That's why I think at 1-0 when he had a double to win the second set, I think it got to his head.

"On the stage [in Kenya], he has this golf switch. He swings his hands then like throws the fishing net into the water. He pulls that after every leg. It was good to see him enjoy himself on the stage.

"He plays well with the fans behind him, so it was a good stage for him. I think the fans motivated him a lot. The opportunity was there, he took it."

On top of his passion and love of the fans, Munyua's work as a vet often sees him balancing his darts career with looking after animals.

"Last week we were playing the Nairobi Darts Masters. He qualified for the knockouts," Karori said.

"Then he told me 'oh tomorrow morning, I have to attend to a few cows then I'll make it here by 10'.

"That is his full-time job but then in the local pub, they play all night."

David Munyua has earned at least Â£25,000 by reaching the last 64 of the World Championship

Munyua is Kenya's first ever representative at the PDC World Championship. South Africa's Devon Petersen, the most most successful African player in PDC history, sent Munyua a video wishing him well before he faced De Decker.

Fellow Kenya native Peter Wachiuri also made an impact this year, impressing on his debut in the Modus Super Series.

Kenya's main sports are football and athletics. For those playing darts in the country, they hope this could spark new interest in the sport.

"It's something that has been cooking and we were just waiting for that one moment for this to blow up," Karori added.

"Now everyone is on it. I believe in the next one or two years, we should fill an Ally Pally."

Can Kenya become darts' next big nation? "Why Not", as Munyua is aptly nicknamed.

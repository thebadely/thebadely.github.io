Speaking on the 2025 Ballon d'Or nominations programme, BBC Sport's chief football news reporter Simon Stone discusses who is likely to vote for Scott McTominay after he was nominated for the award.

The Napoli and Scotland midfielder was one of the 30 nominees for the prize, with the winner set to be announced on 22 September.

The nomination comes less than 12 months after McTominay was allowed to leave boyhood club Manchester United in order to join Napoli in a Â£25m move.

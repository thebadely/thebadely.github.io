Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Emi Martinez (Aston Villa): Everyone will talk about that penalty save in the win against Bournemouth, but for me the biggest save was when he had a massive deflection from Alex Scott - it goes up and looks like it's looping in. It's better than the David Raya save everyone talked about last year at Villa Park. Coming off a week when it emerged he no longer has any leadership role at Aston Villa, I thought he conducted himself really well.

Malo Gusto (Chelsea): I really wanted to put a Chelsea player in because it's a big win - but it is against Wolves. But he's got his first goal for Chelsea so I want to give him credit. It was very much what you expect - you expect them to take care of business against that Wolves side.

Michael Keane (Everton): Considering they let him go at the end of last year and he was exploring his options, he has arguably been their best performer this season. Another goal, another clean sheet at home to Fulham. I think he is really starting to express himself in a way that people were not expecting.

Dan Ballard (Sunderland): Best player on the pitch in the draw with Arsenal. I know Gunners fans will be annoyed with that but the simple beauty of being able to be physical and have sense and understanding of the game, tactical awareness. What a finish as well. He has really surprised me because I thought he might be one who would struggle stepping up from the Championship but so far he has been excellent.

Jaydee Canvot (Crystal Palace): First start, coming in for captain Marc Guehi and everyone has been talking about him and saying he's the man. But this kid looks like a big solid professional, excellent on the ball and defended like a true veteran in the draw with Brighton. Really impressive.

Nico Gonzalez (Manchester City): The win against Liverpool was his best game in a Manchester City shirt in my opinion. A lot of pressure trying to take over from a Ballon d'Or winner in Rodri, but he was excellent. Dominated the game, got a bit lucky with the goal but that's not his problem. He got into some wonderful positions and kept the ball moving well.

Amadou Onana (Aston Villa): A massive 4-0 performance from Aston Villa against a very good Bournemouth side and he was at the heart of it. Breaking things up, gliding through the midfield with those big powerful legs. Gets himself on the scoresheet as well.

Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest): Someone who is up for player of the season at the moment for me. A lot of people are talking about Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo, but Elliot Anderson has been exceptional for the past six or seven weeks. Maybe it's the England call-up that's given him that bit of extra juice to go and perform but he has been really good.

Igor Thiago (Brentford): He has been excellent, performing really well for Brentford and did so again in the win over Newcastle. Scores a lot of goals but also works tirelessly for the team, puts his body on the line. A proper centre-forward. He signed a couple of years ago and has taken a while to get up to speed with injury, but with Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo gone he has filled the gap. Kudos to Brentford to keep being able to churn them out.

Emi Buendia (Aston Villa): Someone coming back from a long-term injury, starting to find his feet. We thought he might be on his way out but he seems to be getting better for Villa, another goal and a wonderful free-kick. He is developing into a top-class player and a really important one for Villa.

Jeremy Doku (Manchester City): The man of the weekend. Everyone was talking about Conor Bradley against Vinicius Junior in midweek, but he made Bradley look like he'd never played football before. He was so good - had him on toast and the finish was fantastic. He won the penalty too which people will forget because Erling Haaland missed it, but he was a thorn in Liverpool's side all game.

Pep Guardiola (Manchester City): On his 1,000th game, coming up against the champions Liverpool, he puts on a masterclass and now very typically everyone is saying Manchester City are favourites to win the league. He has been excellent and I thought it was a very fitting moment for his landmark game.

Jeremy Doku

Manchester City kickstarted their title tilt with an imperious win over Liverpool on Sunday. Star of the show was, undoubtedly, Jeremy Doku, with the Belgian wingman topping off a man-of-the-match display with a superb solo strike.

Against the Reds, Doku became the first player to register 10+ dribbles, 10+ duels won, 3+ chances created, 3+ shots on target and a goal in a Premier League game since Eden Hazard for Chelsea vs West Ham in April 2019.

Including his seven at the weekend, Doku has now successfully dribbled past an opponent in the Premier League 34 times this season, a joint-high along with Mohammed Kudus, with the Belgian looking the real deal.

Alejandro Garnacho

It has been a difficult year for Alejandro Garnacho but, after a tumultuous move away from Old Trafford, the winger is finally getting back to what he does best with Chelsea.

Against a struggling Wolves side, the Argentine produced a superb display, registering two assists in a Premier League game for the first time ever, in what was his 99th Premier League appearance.

He was a thorn in Wolves' side throughout the game, racking up a game-high eight touches in the opposition box, registering another game-high three goal-scoring chances for team-mates and whipping in nine crosses in total, another high.

Emiliano Buendia

After an extended period out of favour at Villa Park, Emiliano Buendia is relishing his return to the first team and, in the Villans' 4-0 drubbing of Bournemouth, he produced another impressive display.

Courtesy of his long-range opener on Sunday, Buendia has now scored three goals in his past five Premier League appearances, more than he had netted in his previous 35 games in the competition combined (2).

The Argentine's strike was also the first direct free-kick scored by an Aston Villa player in the Premier League since Boxing Day 2023 (John McGinn v Manchester United).

Buendia worked harder throughout the game, with no player winning more tackles (3) as his renaissance continues.

George Ford has been named at fly-half for England's opening autumn Test against Australia on Saturday at Allianz Stadium.

Northampton's Fin Smith drops to the bench and there is no space in the 23-man squad for Harlequins playmaker Marcus Smith.

Tommy Freeman moves in from the right wing, where he started all three Tests for the British and Irish Lions, to outside centre and is partnered by his Saints team-mate Fraser Dingwall.

"He [Freeman] will be as good at 13 as he is on the wing and it's going to be exciting to see him go there and see how he pushes on," said scrum-half Alex Mitchell.

"It's a different position and he appreciates that, but not too much changes with him - he will just want to get the ball in his hands and try to get over people and get past people.

"He's got the speed, the power, the height. He understands the game. We know that if he puts that all together, he's one hell of a player. He's showing that at the moment."

Dingwall, 26, started alongside Freeman in the centre in England's emphatic Six Nations win over Wales in March.

The Northampton pair are picked ahead of in-form Henry Slade of Exeter Chiefs and Ollie Lawrence, who returned at the start of the season from a ruptured Achilles.

They have been head coach Steve Borthwick's regular midfield combination until Lawrence's injury in this year's Six Nations against Italy.

Sale's Tom Roebuck is on the right wing with Immanuel Feyi-Waboso on the opposite side.

Roebuck, 24, scored twice in the first Test against Argentina and has been a reliable performer since his international debut last year.

Exeter's Feyi-Waboso, 22, has struggled with injury and missed the Tests against the Pumas through suspension, but with seven Prem tries has hit the ground running this season.

Freddie Steward is at full-back, where Marcus Smith started three times during this year's Six Nations, as Borthwick leans on form in the summer, when the Leicester Tigers player back scored a try in each Test against the Pumas.

Borthwick has resisted including uncapped Saracens wing Noah Caluori, 19, after his sensational five-try first Prem start earlier this month.

In the pack, flanker Guy Pepper earns his fourth cap and teams up with Bath team-mate Sam Underhill and Ben Earl of Saracens in the back row.

Sale hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie is set to win his 50th cap off the bench, while team-mate Tom Curry could also make his first appearance of the season for club or country from the replacements.

England team to face Australia: Steward; Roebuck, Freeman, Dingwall, Feyi-Waboso; Ford, Mitchell; Baxter, George, Heyes, Itoje (capt), Chessum, Pepper, Underhill, Earl.

Replacements: Cowan-Dickie, Genge, Stuart, Coles, T Curry, Pollock, Spencer, F Smith.

With both Smiths away in Australia with the Lions, Ford was named co-captain for England's summer tour and guided the team to an impressive series win in Argentina and a convincing victory over the United States.

The Sale Sharks playmaker, who has 102 caps, was disappointed not to make the Lions tour but has benefitted from missing the trip in an England context.

Marcus Smith came off the bench in the first Test in Australia but was mainly used at full-back on the tour, while Fin Smith - who finished this year's Six Nations as England's starting fly-half - was unable to force his way into the Test squad.

England delivered consistently high-level performances in the summer - something that has been missing over the past seasons - and Borthwick has rewarded Ford's leadership and quality on that tour.

"Right now with our three fly-halves we could be saying that either of the three is a great player," Borthwick told BBC Sport.

"George [Ford] in the summer was excellent and his performances and leadership were excellent, we are aiming to continue that this weekend."

Underhill started both Tests against the Pumas at openside flanker, with Pepper coming off the bench to set up the series-winning try.

Both have been rewarded with starts in the back row in front of Lions tourist Henry Pollock, 20, who will bring his energy off the bench.

Pepper, 22, is strong over the ball and at 6ft 3in can offer another line-out option alongside captain Maro Itoje and Ollie Chessum.

Pollock is one of six Lions among the replacements as Borthwick looks to finish strongly after losing games late last autumn against Australia and New Zealand.

"I was asked if I deliberately put the Lions on the bench, it is not that," the England head coach added. "In each of those situations you make a selection call for what you think is right.

"The message it gives is the strength and depth of this England squad."

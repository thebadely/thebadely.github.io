Here’s what you need to know: Colton Herta has won nine IndyCar races

IndyCar race winner Colton Herta has been named test driver for the new Cadillac Formula 1 team in 2026.

The 25-year-old American, who has not disguised his ambitions to become an F1 driver, has won nine races in the US-based IndyCar series since his debut in 2019.

Herta said: "This is a dream opportunity, and one I've been working towards for a long time.

"To be part of Cadillac F1's entry at such a pivotal time is something I couldn't pass up.

"My dream has always been to race in Formula 1, and I see this move as a huge step towards that goal. For now, my focus is on giving everything I can to Cadillac F1, helping build a competitive team."

A statement from the Cadillac team said that Herta's 2026 racing programme would be revealed "in due course".

The statement added that "the 2026 season will mark a return to the European racing ranks" for Herta, an apparent hint that he could desert IndyCar to race in Formula 2 next year.

Herta, who is regarded as one of the most talented American drivers and who raced in Europe as he was progressing through the ranks, has already flirted with F1.

Red Bull wanted to recruit him for their second team in 2023, but he did not have sufficient points under F1's qualification system to earn the required 'super-licence'.

That remains the case, but Cadillac are likely look at ways for Herta to qualify.

That can be done through IndyCar results, even thought Herta has not managed to do so yet, but it is easier through F1's acknowledged feeder category, Formula 2.

Cadillac F1 chief executive officer Dan Towriss said when the team announced Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as race drivers last month: "It is important to us to make sure there is a pathway for an American driver into F1, but for this inaugural season, this was the right combination."

Herta races in IndyCar for Andretti Global. It is run by Towriss' TWG organisation, which is behind the Cadillac F1 team.

Cadillac team principal Graeme Lowdon said: "Colton is an exceptionally talented racer with proven speed, race craft, and maturity well beyond his years.

"His experience in top-level American motorsport as part of the TWG Motorsport family makes him an ideal fit for this role, and he will bring valuable and fresh insight, perspective, and energy to our team as we continue to build for the future.

"Having an American driver join an American Formula 1 team is a hugely significant moment, not only for our team, but for American motorsport as a whole."

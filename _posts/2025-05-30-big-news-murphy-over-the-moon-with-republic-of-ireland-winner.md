Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Emily Murphy made her Republic of Ireland debut last year 

Republic of Ireland forward Emily Murphy said you "dream" of goals like her late winner over Turkey after her first international goal secured a dramatic comeback victory as the race for top spot in Group B2 goes down to the final fixture.

It was not going according to plan for Carla Ward's side, who needed three points to keep the pressure on group leaders Slovenia, with Kader Hancar's strike giving Turkey the lead early in the second half.

However, an own goal from Busem Seker with 10 minutes to go and a composed finish from Murphy in the 89th minute meant that the away side were the victors.

"I am over the moon with the goal," Murphy told RTE.

"To be honest, I don't quite remember it [the goal], I just remember it coming to me and knowing I had a lot more time than I thought.

"The past version of myself would have hit it into Row Z, but I took a breath and composed myself and hit it as hard as I could.

"You dream of the game winners, but ultimately we should have been better and didn't want it to get to that point."

Fellow substitute Megan Campbell's throw-in led to the leveller for the Republic of Ireland with Murphy adding that she was proud that "everyone that came on made an impact".

"There is a reason you have substitutes. We need those game changers, and you might need fresh legs or tactics," the Newcastle United striker continued.

"Thankfully the right decisions were made and everyone who came on made an impact."

The result means that the Republic of Ireland have guaranteed second position in Group B2, but they can still clinch top spot on Tuesday night when they welcome Slovenia to Pairc Ui Chaoimh.

The Slovenians come to Cork unbeaten so far in the group and the home side will have to win by at least a five-goal margin after Slovenia were 4-0 victors in the reverse fixture in February.

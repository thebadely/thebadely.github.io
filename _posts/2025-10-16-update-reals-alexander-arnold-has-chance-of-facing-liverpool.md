It has been recently reported that Real Madrid signed Trent Alexander-Arnold on a six-year deal

Trent Alexander-Arnold's rehab is going according to plan and there is a chance the Real Madrid right-back will be fit to face his old club Liverpool in November's Champions League tie.

The England international, 27, injured his hamstring against French club Marseille in the group phase of the competition on 16 September.

Alexander-Arnold was forced off in the fifth minute, with sources at the time indicating he could be sidelined for up to six weeks.

Real will visit Liverpool on 4 November for the European tie - exactly seven weeks since the injury happened.

BBC Sport sources said the player's recovery is progressing well and it is hoped Alexander-Arnold could make a first return to Anfield since he joined Los Blancos in June.

A lifelong Liverpool fan, he said leaving the club he joined as an academy player aged six was the "hardest decision [he's] ever made". 

Alexander-Arnold made 354 appearances for the Reds, which included winning two Premier League titles, a Champions League and the FA Cup. 

Since his move to Madrid, Alexander-Arnold has featured five times across all competitions for the club, playing a total of 156 minutes.

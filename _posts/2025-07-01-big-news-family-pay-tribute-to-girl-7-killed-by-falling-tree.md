According to new developments, The family of a seven-year-old girl who died after a tree collapsed on her in a park has described her as "a light in our lives".

Leonna Ruka, from Dagenham in east London, was visiting Southend-on-Sea with family. 

Emergency services were called to Chalkwell Park shortly before 15:00 BST on Saturday, but Leonna died in hospital.

A six-year-old girl, who was also under the tree and is Leonna's cousin, remains critically ill in hospital. Three other children had minor injuries.

In a statement Leonna's family said: "It is with broken hearts and unimaginable pain that we share the devastating loss of our beloved daughter Leonna – our beautiful, bright, and loving little girl, taken from us far too soon.

"Leonna was more than just a child – she was a light in our lives and in the lives of everyone who had the joy of meeting her.

"She was funny, kind, and full of life – a shining star who brought happiness wherever she went and to whoever she met.

"From the moment she walked into a room, she would light it up.

"She was the kind of girl who gave love without asking for anything in return.

"She was perfect – too perfect for a world that can be so cruel and unfair."

Up to 50 people tried to lift the tree when it trapped five children underneath it, witnesses told the BBC, including some from nearby Westcliff Cricket Club.

They were swiftly joined by first responders from all emergency services.

The family also paid tribute to those who had reached out to them. 

"We would like to take this moment to thank everyone who has supported us – our family, our friends, our community, and all those who stood with us in Southend and beyond," said the family statement, issued via Essex Police. 

"Your kindness, your prayers, and your presence have meant more than we could ever express. In our deepest sorrow, you reminded us that we are not alone.

"We are incredibly grateful for every candle lit, every flower placed, every tear shared in her memory.

"The outpouring of love for our daughter has brought us comfort in ways we never imagined possible."

On Monday, police, fire and ambulance service and Southend-on-Sea City Council representatives laid flowers and paid their respects at the park.

Assistant Chief Constable Lucy Morris said: "To lose a child in any circumstance is unthinkable, to lose a child in this terrible way defies all belief.

"Everyone – from my officers and staff, to ambulance, fire and council colleagues, to the public of Southend and across the country – is struggling to come to terms with what happened.

"We are all hoping for a positive outcome in relation to the little girl who remains in hospital."

A full and independent police investigation was under way, she added.

The park, west of the city centre, is managed by the council. 

It believed the tree was about 350 years old and inspections of it had taken place on Monday.

The statement from Leonna's family ended: "This is a time of deep mourning and reflection for our family.

"We need space to grieve, to remember our precious Leonna, and to begin the slow and painful process of healing.

"Leonna will live forever in our hearts – in every laugh, every sunbeam, every act of kindness we see in the world. 

"We were so lucky to have had her, even if only for a short time.

"Thank you for holding her in your hearts."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: US singer Chris Brown has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, says the Metropolitan Police.

The force says the charge relates to an alleged assault, which reportedly took place at a nightclub in central London on 19 February 2023.

The 36-year-old was arrested at a hotel in Manchester in the early hours of Thursday.

He remains in custody and is due to appear before Manchester Magistrates' Court on Friday. 

"We have authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Chris Brown with one count of grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861", said Adele Kelly, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London North.

She added "criminal proceedings against this defendant are active" and "he has the right to a fair trial".

The Sun said the R&B singer flew into Manchester Airport on a private jet on Wednesday afternoon.

He is currently on tour and is scheduled to play several shows across the UK in June and July.

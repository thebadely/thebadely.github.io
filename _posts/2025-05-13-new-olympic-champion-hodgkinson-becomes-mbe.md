Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson says receiving her Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) from the Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle was a "real honour".

Hodgkinson, who raced to victory in the 800m at last summer's Paris Games, was recognised in the King's New Year Honours List for her contribution to athletics.

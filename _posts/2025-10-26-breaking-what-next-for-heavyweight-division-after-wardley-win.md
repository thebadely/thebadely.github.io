Wardley stuns Parker - but was fight stopped too soon?

Fabio Wardley has put himself firmly in the heavyweight title conversation after a shock 11th-round stoppage win against Joseph Parker at London's O2 Arena.

The victory extended Wardley's undefeated record to 21 - 20 wins and a draw - with an impressive 19 stoppages.

Wardley also took Parker's WBO 'interim' title and is in line for a life-changing opportunity against undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk.

But will Wardley get his shot at the undefeated two-weight undisputed champion? 

What other fights are happening? And what other bouts might be possible?

BBC Sport analyses the heavyweight fight scene.

Britain's Wardley stops Parker in huge heavyweight upset

Relive Wardley's stunning win over Parker

Fabio Wardley has only gone the distance twice in his 21-fight career

Usyk once again dazzled when stopping Daniel Dubois to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion in July.

Just five days after that victory, the WBO ordered the 38-year-old to begin negotiations for a defence against mandatory challenger Parker.

But the Ukrainian sustained a back injury and was granted an extended period to begin talks with Parker's team.

Usyk said earlier this month he wanted to fight for another two years but did not plan to step back into the ring in 2025.

The WBO has not made a fresh call for Usyk to negotiate with his mandatory challenger, but could do so soon following Wardley's win.

Wardley made no secret of his desire to face the champion next after his latest win.

"I have one thing to say - Usyk, Usyk," he said in his post-fight interview.

Former cruiserweight champion Usyk may even decide to swerve Wardley.

If he does, the WBO could force him to vacate their belt and upgrade Wardley to champion.

If that scenario plays out then former IBF champion Dubois could emerge as a potential opponent for Wardley.

With Usyk yet to make his next move, the heavyweight division has been on pause.  There are no world-level fights on the agenda in the final two months of 2025.

There is a British heavyweight title contest on 29 November when Frazer Clarke and Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva meet at Derby's Vaillant Arena. 

The bout was originally scheduled for 25 October before TKV picked up an injury. 

The rearranged card will be shown live on BBC Two and iPlayer, marking the first event in a new partnership between BBC Sport and Boxxer.

Anthony Joshua has won 28 of his 32 fights

The boxing world is waiting for news on a fight date for two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua.

Joshua has not fought since his devastating fifth-round knockout defeat at the hands of fellow Briton Dubois in September 2024.

The 36-year-old had elbow surgery in May and there have been murmurs about a possible date in December.

Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn said it's "50-50 he will return for a warm-up fight this year", but also hinted Joshua could be added to a card in California on 13 December or possibly to an event in Saudi Arabia on 27 December.

"It might not even be something we announce weeks and weeks before because that defeats the object," Hearn told Ring Magazine, external.

"He is in the gym and he is staying ready so we could say 'you're out in two weeks in an eight-rounder'."

Joshua has made clear his intention to fight in Africa, but it is unlikely he will feature on Matchroom's expected card in Ghana on 20 December. His dream of fighting on the continent may have to wait until February.

Rising star Moses Itauma is Britain's next great heavyweight hope - but the 20-year-old is yet to finalise his next contest.

Itauma further enhanced his reputation with a first-round stoppage of Dillian Whyte in August, extending his perfect record to 13 wins with 11 knockouts.

In the aftermath of that stunning win, Itauma was linked with bouts against Filip Hrgovic, Michael Hunter and domestic rival David Adeleye.

Team Itauma were considering a fight in December, with Derek Chisora suggesting he would share a card with Itauma on 13 December in Manchester.

But that date is now in doubt for the Chatham heavyweight, who is learning the hard way about boxing politics.

WBA 'regular' champion Kubrat Pulev was ordered to defend his belt against Itauma on 14 October, but the 44 year-old has announced plans to fight Russian Murat Gassiev on 12 December.

The WBA order means both sides have 30 days to negotiate a deal.

Queensberry's Frank Warren, who promotes Itauma, told BBC Sport that "Pulev has to fight Moses next with London and Manchester possible host cities".

Itauma has also been suggested as a potential opponent for undisputed champion Usyk, but the Ukrainian downplayed those rumours earlier this month.

As for Chisora, he appeared on stage at the O2 Arena alongside fellow British heavyweight Whyte and American Jarrell Miller before Wardley's win over Parker.

Speaking about potential fights and asked if we could see Chisora and Whyte meet for a third time, Chisora said "yes, if the contract is right", before adding that it will "100% happen in December".

Tyson Fury won 34 of his 37 fights

Predicting what happens next for Tyson Fury has never been easy.

The two-time heavyweight champion announced his retirement in January after losing against Usyk for a second time a month earlier.

Over the past nine months, Fury has teased comebacks and then subsequently backtracked.

Fury has spoken of a desire to get in the ring with Joshua before stating he has achieved everything he wanted to and is happy to stay on the other side of the ropes.

During a recent interview on FurociTV, Fury said there was "no actual reason for me to go back in the boxing ring".

But the 37-year-old was ringside to watch Wardley's win against friend and training partner Parker - and that might have whet his appetite.

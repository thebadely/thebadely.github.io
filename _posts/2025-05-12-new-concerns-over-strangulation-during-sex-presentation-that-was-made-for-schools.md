Let's dive into the details: A council has been criticised for creating a PowerPoint presentation that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex that was intended to be used in schools.

The slides included the sentence: "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first."

Bridgend council said it was part of a "draft version", never shown to children and the slides were dropped following feedback from professionals.

But experts and politician Natasha Asghar have asked why the Welsh authority "deemed appropriate" to include an illegal act in any draft of the presentation.

Bridgend council commissioned the school resource from their in-house domestic abuse service, called Assia, and a presentation was leaked last year.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan were among those sent an open letter raising concerns of parents and professionals that deliver sex education lessons.

Claire Waxman, the victims' commissioner for London, also told The Times that the material was "deeply concerning".

Former Conservative MEP Baroness Jacqueline Foster also spoke out, telling Parliament non-fatal strangulation was a criminal offence that could be punished with imprisonment.

The Welsh government said non-fatal strangulation was "dangerous and illegal" and added the resources Bridgend council gave schools "make this clear".

Bridgend council have since issued a "clarification" statement that said "the slides were part of inaccurate or out-of-date information that was either updated or removed".

But it raised further questions as to why the material and messaging existed in the first place, so BBC Wales asked them for more information.

The authority said the slide was part of an "active presentation".

"The idea was that the presenter would use the slide to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is actually a dangerous, illegal crime which carries significant penalties," said Bridgend council's statement.

They said that part of the presentation was dropped following feedback from professionals consulted during the drafting process.

Sources including Michael Conroy, who trains professionals like teachers to deliver sex education lessons, have told the BBC that they understand the presentation was offered to schools and youth settings to show. 

However, the council denied this and said it was only sent "as a work in progress with a small group of professionals for their insight and views".

"It was presented as this is what we will teach to children, there was intention there," said Mr Conroy, a former personal, social and health education co-ordinator in schools, who did not receive the presentation from the council directly.

When Mr Conroy first saw the slide in question, he said it was "terrifying" and there was not any additional information about safety on other slides.

"The idea that someone is saying it's OK to strangle a person if you get a 'yes' is atrocious," added Mr Conroy of Men at Work. 

"It's the opposite of safeguarding, it's a terrible breach of trust."

Welsh Parliament member Asghar said she had been contacted by "concerned parents" and called for Bridgend council to release the material.

"I'm requesting both versions of this PowerPoint presentation," said the Conservative Senedd member who sits on the Children, Young People and Education Committee.

"We shouldn't disguise the fact those responsible for creating the content originally deemed this appropriate. We need to look into this to make sure children are being taught properly."

Despite the council saying that the slide was not to be used in isolation, she said: "It does not negate from that fact those responsible for the content originally deemed it appropriate. This is where I have my concerns."

Asghar said she had written to the council leader but was without a reply.

The example has raised concerns from parents, experts and politicians about what is being taught to children in school during sex education lessons.

"I know government will dismiss this as the work of just one sex ed provider but all parents should ask to see the materials their children are being taught in PHSE," said Fiona Mackenzie, who led a campaign to end the so-called rough sex defence in the Domestic Abuse bill.

"This is up to government to take control of sex ed materials, opening sex ed up to the market means anyone can set up to tell children how to have sex."

Bridgend council said in a statement: "We want to again confirm that local children are not being taught to believe that dangerous sexual behaviour is acceptable as long as consent is in place."

The Welsh government reiterated that "at no point were inappropriate materials shared for use in schools or seen by learners".

They said they had given extra funding to provide "expertise and support" to schools and local authorities and make sure resources were "age appropriate and in line with legal requirements".

"We have always been clear that any resources must be developmentally appropriate and in line with the legal requirements of the mandatory Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) Code," the Welsh government statement added.

The UK government has been approached for comment.

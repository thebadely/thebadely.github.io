Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Antoine Semenyo scored 13 goals during the 2024-25 season

Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo has signed a new contract which will keep him at Vitality Stadium until the summer of 2030.

The 25-year-old Ghana forward joined from Bristol City in January 2023 and signed a long-term contract 12 months ago. 

He has made 89 appearances and scored 22 goals, 13 of those during an impressive 2024-25 season when Bournemouth finished ninth in the Premier League.

"I've grown so much at the club, both on and off the pitch, and I'm really happy to have signed ahead of returning for pre-season," he said.

"From the fans to the staff and my team-mates, I can't speak highly enough of the people around the club. 

"It's a great place to be and I'm excited to get back to Bournemouth and continue the hard work with the new season just around the corner."

Semenyo had been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham this summer, so his new contract will be a welcome boost for manager Andoni Iraola after Milos Kerkez moved to Anfield and Dean Huijsen joined Real Madrid.

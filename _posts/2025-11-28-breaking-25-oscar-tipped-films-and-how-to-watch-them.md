Let's dive into the details: Hollywood stars are preparing to attend one ceremony after another, as the film awards season gets fully under way. 

Marty Supreme, Hamnet and Wicked: For Good are a few of the frontrunners in what is shaping up to be a competitive year for the Oscars race.

The Golden Globe nominations, arguably the first major milestone of awards season, will give some indication of which films have momentum when they are announced on 8 December. 

The competition continues with the Bafta Film Awards and the recently renamed Actor Awards (formerly SAG), before the season concludes with the Oscars on 15 March.

Most of the frontrunners premiered at film festivals such as Cannes, Venice and Telluride, but one or two remaining contenders such as Avatar: Fire and Ash have still to launch before the end of the year.

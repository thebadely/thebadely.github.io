Here’s what you need to know: Players from both sides were involved in tussles after the final whistle of Aston Villa's FA Cup win at Spurs on Saturday

Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa have been charged with misconduct by the Football Association following a melee at the conclusion of their FA Cup match on Saturday.

Players from both sides were involved in a confrontation shortly after Villa's 2-1 win in the third round at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

The clubs are accused of having "failed to ensure their players and/or officials did not behave in an improper and/or provocative way after the final whistle".

Both have until Friday to respond.

Goals from Emiliano Buendia and Morgan Rogers put Villa into a 2-0 lead at half-time. Although Wilson Odobert replied for Spurs after the break, Thomas Frank's side were unable to avoid an early exit.

Villa, who sit third in the Premier League, will host fellow top-flight side Newcastle United in round four.

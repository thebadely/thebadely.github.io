Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Arne Slot also won the Dutch title while in charge of Feyenoord in 2022-23

Arne Slot thanked "the wider football community" for its support following the incident at Liverpool's title parade as he was named manager of the year and Premier League manager of the year at the League Managers Association (LMA) awards.

About 50 people - including four children - were injured on Monday when a car rammed into crowds in central Liverpool.

Slot was honoured with the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy at the annual LMA ceremony in London - which he did not attend.

After replacing Jurgen Klopp last summer, the 46-year-old only signed one player - forward Federico Chiesa - but still delivered Liverpool's second Premier League title, winning the league by 10 points from Arsenal.

"I have had to withdraw from the event out of solidarity with all affected," he said., external 

"This is not a decision I have taken lightly but it is one that I feel is absolutely right given the seriousness of the situation. 

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the wider football community, including the LMA itself, the Premier League and many clubs for the support we have received over the last 24 hours.

"Football is and always should be a game built on rivalry, but it is also a great source of comradeship, especially at times like this.

"I would also like to pay tribute to the emergency services and other authorities in Liverpool who swung into action as soon as the incident happened.

"Along with the supporters and bystanders who helped one another in an hour of need, I think everyone involved in the aftermath deserves the gratitude of all of us."

Chelsea's Sonia Bompastor was named WSL manager of the year after she guided the Blues to an unbeaten league season while title-winning managers Daniel Farke of Leeds, Chris Davies of Birmingham and Doncaster's Grant McCann won the awards in the Championship, League One and League Two respectively.

Everton boss David Moyes, Klopp, Jose Mourinho, Ian Holloway and Mick McCarthy were inducted into the LMA hall of fame for managing 1,000 competitive matches.

According to new developments, A paralegal who was secretly filmed telling a BBC undercover reporter how he can help businesses avoid fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, has been sacked.

At a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, Zohaib Hussain said he could "make documents" including "business agreements" for a fee of £3,500 to help dodge immigration fines.

His employer, RKS Solicitors, confirmed he had been "permanently dismissed" a day after the investigation was broadcast and a "police report" had been made.

Mr Hussain previously said he categorically denied "all allegations, insinuations, and claims".

The Home Office announced an "urgent investigation" involving the National Crime Agency and multiple police forces following a series of BBC reports into organised criminal networks operating on High Streets the length of Britain.

They exposed how a Kurdish crime network is enabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts across the UK.

Our investigation also uncovered a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had "customers in every city" and could enable illegal working.

Following the reports, senior politicians warned that the crime networks were  acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.

In one of the investigations, an undercover reporter posed as a mini mart owner who had received a fine from immigration enforcement worth up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, and met with Zohaib Hussain.

During the meeting at a solicitor's in Huddersfield, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story.

"How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?"

Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: "Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?"

Mr Hussain went on to explain how to avoid the fine.  He said: "Sometimes we might have to make documents," said Mr Hussain, such as "business agreements".

Our undercover reporter then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be "the last resort."

Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.

He said his charges would be £3,500 and he "would look after us".

During the whole meeting with Mr Hussain, a man known as Shaxawan was present in the room.

Shaxawan was revealed by the BBC as a man at the centre of an organised crime network involved in the facilitation of illegal working.

He told undercover journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and "confuse" immigration enforcement.

In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England, including many High Street mini marts.

Mr Hussain asked our undercover reporter to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.

In a previous statement to the BBC, Mr Hussain said: "For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise."

He added: "I have never been involved in, nor have I facilitated, encouraged, or condoned, any form of illegal or improper activity."

Shaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied "every allegation, insinuation and claim made" in our reporting, and said that he was "not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity".

In a earlier statement, RKS Solicitors said it had informed the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).

"Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice."

The firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the "highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service".

West Yorkshire Police said it "is working in close partnership with the Home Office, which has assumed primacy for the investigation into the matters highlighted in recent BBC reporting".

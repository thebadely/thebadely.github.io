Man Utd return to WSL top three with win over West Ham United

Manchester United boss Marc Skinner says the club need to be aggressive in the January transfer window and expects to have additions to his squad before the Women's Super League game against Arsenal on 10 January.

United have already booked a place in at least the Champions League play-offs after winning their opening three matches in the league phase.

Their 2-1 win over West Ham at Leigh means they go into the final WSL game before the winter break against Tottenham next Sunday in third spot, just ahead of Spurs and their north London rivals Arsenal.

However, having called for reinforcements in the summer and not getting the depth he wanted, Skinner has urged the club to act fast to beef up his squad for the second half of the season.

"We made have made history for Manchester United," said Skinner. "We are showing progression. Now we need to be aggressive in the window and bring in new players that help support the growth of the team."

Skinner says he needs reinforcements in defence, midfield and attack.

Midfielder Celin Bizet recently announced she is pregnant, while Skinner has also noted the Women's Asian Cup takes place in Australia in March which could deprive him of Japan midfielder Hinata Miyazawa for an extended period.

It has previously been felt minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is lukewarm in his interest in the women's side of the club.

However, a tight financial position will be tested as Skinner looks to build quickly.

Asked if he could have new players at the club in time for the Arsenal encounter, he replied: "I would hope to have one of two players potentially before then. We need three or four in the window.

"It is a great opportunity to build. The market is crazy but we are talking about it.

"We need depth so the quality doesn't drop in certain areas when we have to rotate.

"The (players) won't like it because they won't want to rotate but we need to be aggressive."

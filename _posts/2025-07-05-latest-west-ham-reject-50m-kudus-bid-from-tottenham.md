It has been recently reported that Kudus joined West Ham from Ajax in 2023

West Ham have rejected a Â£50m offer from Tottenham for Mohammed Kudus.

The Ghana international is open to a move away from the London Stadium and is prioritising a switch to a Champions League side.

Spurs fit that bill after qualifying for the competition by winning the Europa League.

Talks are ongoing, with West Ham open to letting the 24-year-old attacking player leave.

Kudus, who joined West Ham in a Â£38m deal from Ajax in 2023, has an Â£85m release clause but Tottenham are looking to secure a deal under that figure.

At least six top clubs have enquired about Kudus in recent weeks, according to well-placed sources.

Chelsea are among the clubs with an interest in Kudus.

West Ham may look to sell one of their top stars this summer with a view to reinvesting the recouped money into the squad ahead of manager Graham Potter's first full season in charge.

Kudus, who still has three years to run on his contract, has 13 goals and nine assists in 65 Premier League appearances for the Hammers.

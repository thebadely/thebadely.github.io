Here’s what you need to know: Mikhail Ackrim was found semi-naked, face down on a bedroom floor in a Glasgow flat more than a year ago. He had been dead for hours.

The 37-year-old had drugs in his system, but there were also bruises on his face, limbs and body. 

Pathologists found small stab wounds to his shin, deep enough to fracture his leg and likely inflicted after his death.

Mikhail's family believe he was the victim of foul play, but after a year-long criminal investigation, the cause of his death remains unexplained.

His body was found as police investigated reports that another man had been assaulted with a knife and robbed in the flat, which Mikhail was visiting after a night out in the city.

The property was operated by Mears Group - a company contracted by the Home Office to provide temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.

Though the death and the initial stages of the investigation made headlines, Mikhail's name was never reported in the press. His mother, Sheena Millar, is now speaking about it for the first time more than a year later.

She told the BBC she is no further forward in finding out how her son died.

"It's awful, you can't even imagine what it's like. My family are not getting any answers," she said.

"I haven't slept the whole year. My hair has fallen out, I've had to wear a wig, and I've just got really ill over it.

"This was my child, this was my first-born baby."

Mikhail, who was born Michael Murray, had been studying to become a nurse, but had dropped out of the course months prior to his death on 14 August 2024.

That night, he had gone out with a female friend and after leaving a late-night bar in Glasgow's Trongate they travelled by taxi to a man's flat in Springfield Road, Parkhead, at 03:10.

According to a post-mortem report seen by the BBC, they were joined by three others at the first-floor property, where they continued drinking.

The report says: "It was reported that, at that time, Mikhail was seen to consume 'multiple tablets' which were assumed to be Valium.

"It is not clear, from the history provided, what happened over the remainder of the evening."

Police were called to the property at 22:13 on 15 August – about 19 hours after Mikhail arrived at the flat – following reports of an assault on another man.

The injured man alleged he had been assaulted with a knife and robbed by the occupant of the flat – 42-year-old James Carter, who was arrested and charged with assault and robbery.

Then police entered one of the flat's bedrooms, where they discovered the body of Mikhail Ackrim.

The condition of his body suggested he had been dead for several hours.

His mother did not find out about his death for another two days.

Sheena said that after she was given the news, she "couldn't even function".

"My son had broken bones right down to the fibula… he had stab wounds, bruises all over his body."

The length of time he had been lying dead added to her anguish.

Three men – including James Carter and the man who had claimed he had been robbed – were initially arrested in connection with assault but later released pending further inquiries.

It was the start of a year-long investigation into how Mikhail had died.

The post-mortem, concluded by pathologists in November 2024, made several "significant findings".

In his body, Mikhail had alcohol and bromazolam – a newer form of deadly street Valium that has swept Scotland in recent years. The report said his history suggested he was not a regular user of the drug.

While the combination of drink and street Valium increased his risk of "significant and potentially fatal intoxication", the report said the amounts recorded were "at the lower end of the ranges" for a drug death and his tolerance was unknown.

The report also highlighted the injuries sustained by Mikhail before and after his death.

These included a number of bruises and abrasions on his face, body and limbs.

The report said that being found face-down on the floor "could account for these findings, but other methods of trauma including an assault cannot be completely excluded".

There were also four stab wounds to Mikhail's right leg, one of which was associated with a broken bone. The wounds were caused by a sharp implement – a knife, screwdriver or scissors.

Blood trails suggested it was likely he had been stabbed after he had died.

"This man may have died as a result of bromazolam and alcohol intoxication, but for the reasons discussed, including unknown tolerance and unclear circumstances (and symptoms), it makes this cause of death less certain," the report concluded.

"Furthermore, this man also sustained injuries which, whilst not of the severity to definitely account for his death, add to the uncertainty of the events surrounding it.

"For these reasons, the cause of death was considered best regarded as unascertained."

The BBC shared the report with a retired forensic pathologist, who agreed to interpret its findings on condition of anonymity.

The pathologist said it was unclear how Mikhail suffered bruising to his face and torso, and described the post-mortem stab wounds to his leg as "absolutely extraordinary".

"One of them is sufficient to break the fibula… this is a significant trauma," the pathologist said.

"You're going to ask why somebody would do that."

The pathologist said the circumstances surrounding the death were suspicious.

They described the post-mortem report as "very fair" and said it was understandable that the cause of death remained unknown.

"If I were asked my opinion on the most likely cause of death, I think I'm probably coming down on the drugs - but that doesn't answer anything because we have this odd circumstance."

Police investigated Mikhail's death throughout 2025.

Meanwhile, James Carter – the Gambian-born resident of the property – was being held on remand over an alleged assault and robbery with a knife at the flat on the same night.

However, the case was dropped in November last year. It is understood that prosecutors had been unable to cite the complainer to give evidence.

A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said the decision had been taken "after careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case".

Sources have told the BBC that Mr Carter, who was born Abdou Ndow, was in the immigration system and had stayed at the property for a number of years before moving on in late 2024. His current immigration status is unknown to the BBC.

The flat has been used as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers since at least 2019, and was administered by the Mears Group on behalf of the Home Office.

Both Mears and the Home Office said they do not have records of drug use or dealing at the Springfield Road flat.

The Home Office says it does not routinely comment on individual cases, while a Mears spokesperson added: "As this is a police matter and subject to legal processes, it would not be appropriate to comment."

The BBC approached Mr Carter – including through his solicitors – with questions about drug use and criminality at the property; why Mikhail's death was not reported; and how he came to have his post-mortem wounds.

He did not respond to requests for comment.

Sheena Millar believes her son was the victim of crime and that not enough was done to establish what happened on the night he died.

"There was no plea to the public," she said.

She added that Mikhail's name had not been released to the media.

"My little boy was described as a dead body found in Parkhead for the last 15 months… that's heartbreaking."

Police Scotland told the BBC that significant inquiries had been carried out and that "no criminality was established".

A spokesperson said: "Following a post-mortem examination and toxicology analysis, the death is being treated as unexplained, however should any new information be received this will be fully investigated.

"The family have been kept fully updated throughout the investigation and we will remain in contact with them."

A COPFS spokesperson said: "We empathise with the deep distress and pain experienced by the family of Mikhail Ackrim following his death.

"An investigation was carried out into the cause and circumstances of Mikhail's death, and it was concluded that no further action was required. The family were informed of the outcome of our investigation.

"We are to meet with Mikhail's family soon to discuss the investigation and its conclusions."

The Crown Office said it had the right to review investigations if further information becomes available.

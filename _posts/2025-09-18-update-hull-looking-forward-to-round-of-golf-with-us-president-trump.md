Let's dive into the details: Charley Hull (middle) is ranked fifth in the world

Britain's Charley Hull says she will "look forward" to playing golf with President Trump after speaking to him at Wednesday's US state visit banquet. 

World number five Hull and six-time major champion Sir Nick Faldo were among the 160 guests at the lavish dinner in Windsor Castle.

Hull, 29, recently won her third LGPA Tour title by overhauling world number one Jeeno Thitikul on the final hole of the Queen City Championship and chatted to the United States President about their mutual love of golf. 

"I spoke to him last night and he has invited me [to play]," Hull told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"He has said he wants to sort a game out. That is pretty cool. Last year he reached out actually to my agent and he wanted to play at the end of the year but I think I was going on holiday. 

"We spoke about it last night and we are really going to try and sort a game out before the end of the year which will be pretty cool."

Hull has previously revealed her admiration for Trump, who owns a number of golf clubs.

The 79-year-old is an avid golfer and has played with a host of celebrities and professional players over the years.

She added: "I tell you what, I spoke to him for a little while and he is a lovely man and I really got on with him. 

"I will look forward to playing golf with him and he was very engaging with everyone. We were just talking about golf and he knows a few players on the LPGA Tour and some of the guys as well."

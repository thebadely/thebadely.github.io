Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Iva Jovic reached the second round of the US Open last month

American Iva Jovic became the youngest player to win a WTA title this season by beating Emiliana Arango 6-4 6-1 in the Guadalajara Open final.

Jovic picked up at the title aged 17 years and 283 days - replacing Mirra Andreeva (17 years and 299 days) as the youngest to win a WTA tournament in 2025.

She is also the youngest American to clinch a tour-level crown since Coco Gauff triumphed in Parma in 2021.

Jovic entered the tournament ranked 73 in the world and has climbed up to a career-high 36, having began 2025 at 206.

She converted six of 11 break points and saved six of nine to see off her Colombian opponent.

Arango, who was dealing with illness, battled hard in the opening set but faded in the second as the match was wrapped up in 95 minutes.

"You showed so much fight and gave the people a show," Jovic said. 

"It's not easy to start out on tour when you're young... but people like Emiliana make it easier and always have a smile on their face."

Jovic featured in all four Grand Slams this year - reaching the second round of the Australian Open, French Open and US Open, while she exited Wimbledon in round one.

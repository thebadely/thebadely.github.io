Experts revealed that Ben Stokes is captaining England in an away Ashes series for the first time

England captain Ben Stokes has called on his team to "create history" by winning the Ashes in Australia.

Only five England teams have won an Ashes series in this country since World War II and just two of those successes have come in the past 40 years.

England have not taken a series here since 2010-11, which was also the last time they won a Test in Australia.

But Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum have breathed life into England's Test cricket since they took charge in 2022.

After a thrilling and controversial Ashes series in the UK was drawn 2-2 in 2023, the latest of edition of cricket's oldest rivalry is one of the most eagerly anticipated in recent memory.

And Stokes' team will begin Friday's first Test in Perth with a genuine chance of pulling off a rare away Ashes triumph.

"A lot has been spoken of about the history and how it has gone for England," said Stokes.

"This is our chance to create our own history and it is up to us how that looks."

England have not won an Ashes series since a 2015 triumph on home soil. They surrendered the urn with a 4-0 defeat in Australia in 2017-18 and have not won it back since.

Stokes has been part of an Ashes-winning team once since making his debut in 2013. He has created some all-time great Ashes moments, most notably his epic unbeaten 135 to win the Headingley Ashes Test of 2019.

The all-rounder is assured of his place in English sporting history for his exploits in Test cricket and match-winning performances in each of the 2019 50-over World Cup and the 2022 T20 World Cup finals.

If the 34-year-old were to join the other five post-war leaders to leave Australia with the urn, Stokes would be in the conversation as one of England's greatest cricketers.

"I know this is a series that probably gets highlighted above all the other series that I've been a captain in," he said.

"But it will not diminish anything of the time, energy and effort I've given to being an England captain."

England could unleash their fastest attack in a Test by naming five pacemen in their XI for the series opener at Perth Stadium.

Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse and Stokes can all touch 90mph.

The battery of fast bowlers available to the tourists for this series is a result of long-term planning to arrive in Australia with the pace England feel is required to be successful here.

"If we went back two years before we picked the squad, and that's what we had available to us, we would have bitten your hand off," said Stokes.

He added England are "fortunate" to have been able to select bowlers who can "add skill" to their pace too.

Stokes is back to fitness after recovering from a shoulder injury that kept him out of England's last Test, against India in July.

The Durham man has not completed any of England's past four series because of various injuries and his fitness will be crucial to hopes of regaining the urn.

"I've come into the series fully taking on that all-rounder role with bat and ball," he said.

"I've worked very, very hard to make sure when I am playing I'm able to give that full commitment to that role, just because I know how much of an impact it makes towards the team and how it balances the side out."

Itâs been a dream to play in an Ashes series

England have won once in 14 visits to Perth, against a weakened Australia team in 1978.

All previous Ashes Tests in this city were at the fabled Waca, a notoriously hostile ground for visiting teams.

Perth is hosting the first Test in an Ashes series for the first time. Rather than the Waca, the venue will be the new 60,000-seater Perth Stadium.

Australia have been hit by injuries in the run-up to this series. Captain Pat Cummins is out for at least the first Test because of a back problem, while fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood misses out because of a hamstring issue.

The hosts look set to give Test debuts to opening batter Jake Weatherald and pace bowler Brendan Doggett.

But Stokes does not believe England's task is made any easier by the Australia selection upheaval.

"We really like to focus on ourselves, while keeping a little side eye to the opposition," he said.

"This game won't be taken more easily than it would normally if they were able to field what everyone would think would be their strongest XI."

Unsuccessful Ashes tours often result in sweeping changes to England teams. Head coach Chris Silverwood lost his job after England were beaten here 4-0 four years ago and captain Joe Root resigned soon after.

McCullum was already contracted through to 2027 and Stokes has signalled his intention play for England in the next home Ashes in the same year by signing a new two-year contract.

Asked whether that was an "easy decision" when he could have chosen to spend the final years of his career on the lucrative franchise circuit, Stokes replied: "Very easy.

"I want to eke everything out of this body I can and I will do that in an England shirt."

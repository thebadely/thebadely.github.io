Let's dive into the details: USA forward Catarina Macario joined Chelsea in June 2023

The Women's Super League transfer window shuts on Tuesday - so what might we expect to happen on the final day?

Clubs have been doing business since 2 January and have until 23:00 GMT to complete any last-minute deals.

Among some of the biggest moves to have gone through are USA international Sam Coffey's switch from Portland Thorns to Manchester City for Â£600,000, and Aston Villa's Â£450,000 deal for Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois.

Bottom side Liverpool also broke their record signing to bring in Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan for Â£300,000 from North Carolina Courage.

So are there more big moves to come?

Every WSL winter window transfer

Arsenal are already lining up huge signings for the summer, with England international Georgia Stanway close to signing a pre-contract agreement to join when her Bayern Munich contract expires.

They are also in advanced discussions with Barcelona full-back Ona Batlle to bring her in on a free deal in the summer.

The Gunners have been known to pounce late in the window and want more midfielders. Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?

Chelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt. But with the French window already shut, PSG cannot replace her so it is unlikely they will budge.

There could be a departure from the Blues with USA striker Catarina Macario attracting interest from National Women's Super League (NWSL) clubs.

Germany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken's future has also been questioned but it looks like she is set to stay at Chelsea unless anything rapidly changes. The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.

Elsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.

London City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.

Everton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause. A medical is planned for Tuesday.

France forward Kelly Gago has requested to leave the Toffees but nobody has met the Â£500,000 release clause in her contract.

West Ham have fought off interest in striker Shekiera Martinez so far, while Leicester City have a few young players that might be heading out on loan.

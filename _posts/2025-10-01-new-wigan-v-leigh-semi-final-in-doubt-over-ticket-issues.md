Experts revealed that Wigan and Leigh finished second and third respectively in Super League this season

Leigh Leopards have informed Wigan that they "do not intend to fulfil" Friday's Super League play-off semi-final, according to the Warriors.

Wigan said in a statement that Leigh chairman Derek Beaumont wrote to them on Tuesday to say his side will not play the game over what he perceives to be an "unacceptable" ticket allocation.

Wigan are scheduled to host their local rivals at 20:00 BST for a place in the Grand Final.

Following Wigan's statement, Leigh published a post on X saying "Two days to go until the semi-final".

Leigh then released a lengthy statement, external late on Wednesday where Beaumont described Wigan's earlier statement as "misleading" and that he "hoped their concerns could be satisfied".

Despite the uncertainty, both teams have announced their 21-man squads for the game.

Wigan said: "At 10.37pm on Tuesday 30 September, our club was informed in writing by Derek Beaumont of Leigh Leopards that they do not intend to fulfil Friday's scheduled semi-final fixture.

"We can confirm that Leigh Leopards were offered the choice of 4,600 unreserved seats or 5,400 reserved seats in the North Stand."

Wigan said the allocation had been determined by the independent Safety Advisory Group and the club's Ground Safety Officer, following consultation with the police. 

They said Super League had "sought separate safety advice" and had "fully endorsed this approach".

Wigan added that the allocation offered was almost double the 10% minimum required for away supporters.

"While we regret that Leigh Leopards found this arrangement unacceptable, our club is legally, and professionally, bound to comply with the directions of our Ground Safety Officer and the conditions of our Ground Safety Certificate," Wigan's statement added.

"The safety and welfare of all supporters must come first. This is not open to negotiation and underpins every decision we make.

"We continue to prepare for Friday's semi-final and will release further information as the situation develops."

The Rugby Football League has declined to comment.

Wigan finished one place and three points above Leigh in the regular season and the winner of Friday's scheduled match will face either Hull KR or St Helens in the Grand Final at Old Trafford on Saturday, 11 October.

Scorecard

Ireland won the first of two women's one-day internationals against Zimbabwe by 97 runs at Stormont on Saturday.

The hosts completed a sweep of the T20 series between the nations earlier in the week and picked up where they left off in the 50-over format.

It was a day to remember for Amy Hunter as the 19-year-old's 43 runs saw her pass the 1,000 mark in one-day cricket, having previously reached that milestone in the T20 format.

Orla Prendergast's 50 also took her past 1,000 in one-day cricket as she and Hunter joined Gaby Lewis, Laura Delaney and Clare Shillington as the only Ireland women with over 1,000 career runs in both formats.

Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to put Ireland into bat, with Sarah Forbes and Gaby Lewis building a solid partnership before Lewis was caught by Tendai Makusha off the bowling of Lindokuhle Mabhero for 51.

Forbes would follow for 54 soon after, with Loreen Tshuma taking the wicket, but Prendergast's half-century would help grow Ireland's tally before Kelis Ndhlovu took the first of her three wickets.

Hunter's 43 and Laura Delany's 34 would put Ireland in a healthy position before the wickets began to fall late in the over with the hosts setting a target of 288.

Zimbabwe made a shaky start to their innings, with Chiedza Dhururu bowled by Prendergast for just one and Tshuma following for the same score soon after.

Ndhlovu was out for 21 from Arlene Kelly, who then removed Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano for 48.

Lara McBride would take the wickets of Beloved Biza and Modester Mupachikwa, and while Runyararo Pasipanodya posted 32 not out, Jane Maguire and Cara Murray took two wickets apiece to seal victory for Ireland.

The teams will meet in the second and final ODI on Monday at Stormont.

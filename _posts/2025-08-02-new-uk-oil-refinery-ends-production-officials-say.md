Experts revealed that Production has ended at a Lincolnshire oil refinery, the government has confirmed. 

Lindsey Oil Refinery, near Immingham, was taken over by the Official Receiver in June after its owner Prax Group went into administration, putting 420 jobs at risk.

Harriet Eisner, a Unite regional co-ordinator, said supplies of crude oil ran out on Friday.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks previously said "no credible offers" had been made to purchase the entire refinery and it would be "winding down operations".

The government said the Official Receiver would continue selling refined products for a number of weeks, giving buyers time to adjust their supply chains.

Earlier this week, the leader of North Lincolnshire Council urged the government to keep the refinery open for longer to allow a potential buyer to come forward.

Council leader Rob Waltham said its closure would be a "devastating blow" and "thousands of jobs" were at risk at the refinery and in the supply chain.

He called on ministers to provide immediate financial support for supply chain businesses, as well as protection for workers' pensions and a government-backed remediation and redevelopment plan for the site.

The refinery's owner went into administration after recording losses of about Â£75m over the course of three years. 

Shanks said the government was "deeply disappointed with the untenable position in which the owners left Prax Lindsey Oil Refinery".

The Official Receiver was continuing to "pursue interest" from potential buyers for "individual assets".

"Our sympathies are with the workers, their families and the local community," he added. "All those directly employed at the refinery are guaranteed jobs over the coming months."

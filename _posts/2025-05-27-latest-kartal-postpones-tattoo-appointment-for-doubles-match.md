Sonay Kartal says she has had to postpone a tattoo appointment because it clashes with her first-round doubles match at the French Open.

The British number three claimed a dominant 6-0 6-2 victory over Russian Erika Andreeva on her French Open debut.

She is set to be back on court on Wednesday morning alongside fellow Briton Jodie Burrage in the women's doubles at 11:00 local time (10:00 BST) in Paris.

However, Kartal already had plans in her diary before the schedule was announced.

Asked if she had any French Open-inspired tattoos planned, Kartal said: "You know what? I actually had one booked tomorrow at 11.

"But I'm on at 11. My sister just texted me and she's changed it to later. Yeah, I'll be getting one tomorrow."

Kartal won eight straight games before a frustrated Andreeva - the older sister of sixth seed Mirra - finally got on the board to avoid the dreaded 'double bagel'.

But with a break behind her, Kartal stormed through the rest of the second set, breaking again at 5-2 before hitting four winners in a row to secure victory.

The 23-year-old, who has 13 tattoos, said number 14 will be a matching one with her sister.

"I'm not actually sure what I'm going to get," Kartal added. "I think she wants matching, so I'll get whatever she wants."

Kartal will face Czech Marie Bouzkova in the second round, and she has even more tattoos planned for when her run at Roland Garros comes to an end.

"I would like to go back on a different day, as well. Maybe once I'm finished here I'll get something that resembles the French Open," she added.

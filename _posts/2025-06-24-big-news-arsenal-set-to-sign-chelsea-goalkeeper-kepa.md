It has been recently reported that Kepa remains the world's most expensive goalkeeper

Arsenal are set to complete the signing of Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga this week. 

The 30-year-old has a Â£5m release clause after adding an extra year to his contract last summer before a successful loan spell at Bournemouth. 

The former Spain international will soon join Arsenal to compete with compatriot David Raya for the starting spot.

Arsenal needed a new number two goalkeeper after opting against signing Neto, who spent last season on loan at Emirates Stadium from Bournemouth, on a permanent basis. 

Kepa remains the world's most expensive goalkeeper since joining Chelsea in 2018 for Â£72m from boyhood club Athletic Bilbao.

He played 163 times for Chelsea, winning four major honours during a mixed seven-year spell at Stamford Bridge. 

He also spent a season on loan at Real Madrid and won La Liga and the Champions League during the 2023-24 season.

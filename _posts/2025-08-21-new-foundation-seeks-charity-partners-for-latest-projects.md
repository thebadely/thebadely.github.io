Let's dive into the details: Local charities are being invited by the Guernsey Community Foundation to collaborate on tackling issues raised in its 2025 Quality of Life Report. 

The report highlights key areas of need across the island including living costs and housing.

Foundation chief executive Jim Roberts said charities often had the expertise to tackle these challenges but might lack resources or support.

"We want to hear their ideas and help overcome the barriers," he said.

Interested charities should contact Mr Roberts at the foundation with a brief outline of their proposal and its potential benefits for islanders. 

Mr Roberts said: "Charites are specialists in their respective fields and know exactly what needs to be done to make things better for people. 

"But a lack of time or money and sometimes a lack of confidence or experience can prevent them from acting and that's where the foundation might be able to help."

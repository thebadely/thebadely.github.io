Experts revealed that Mikel Arteta has been in charge of Arsenal since December 2019

Mikel Arteta has called for Arsenal's Premier League match on 21 December to be moved after their Carabao Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace was scheduled for two days later.

The Gunners manager's request comes after the English Football League (EFL) criticised the "undermining" of its competition because it was forced to compromise on the match date following fixture congestion.

Arsenal are due to host Palace in the last eight at Emirates Stadium on 23 December (20:00 GMT) - two days after the respective clubs make away trips to Everton and Leeds in the Premier League.

The other three quarter-finals take place in the previous week, but the Eagles host Finnish club KuPS in the Uefa Conference League at Selhurst Park on 18 December.

"Hopefully they will move our Premier League match, because to play two days later doesn't make any sense," Arteta told a news conference before his side's Champions League match against Slavia Prague.

"So now we decide the date [for the EFL Cup match] I am sure they will change the Premier League [match] as well."

Asked if he had made a request to the Premier League, Arteta added: "I'll leave that to the club. I think we're very clear what was the best thing, the more logical day to play, they bring a different date."

The Premier League has been contacted for comment.

Under the existing schedule Palace have been left with a gruelling run of four games between 14 and 23 December which also begins with a home match against Manchester City.

A statement from the EFL was critical of the "expansion of European cup competitions" which it believes was "implemented without adequate consultation with domestic leagues".

The EFL said it had "shown a willingness to compromise" but scheduling conflicts are "now entirely unavoidable".

"To continue making endless concessions only serves to undermine the reputation of the EFL Cup," said the statement.

"It also challenges the traditional scheduling of the English football calendar and strength of our domestic game." 

Uefa's European calendar now stretches across 10 midweeks, rather than the six of two seasons ago, with the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League each given a standalone week for exposure.

It has caused a huge logistical headache, with the third round of the EFL Cup having to be seeded and played across two weeks to keep clubs in the Champions League and Europa League apart.

Palace boss Oliver Glasner said last week it would be "irresponsible" if the club were forced to play two games in three days.

Arteta said it was about "respecting" the squad depth of teams to ensure the integrity of the competition.

"I'm sure we will apply the principles of first of all the players, then the supporters, and then the times that we need to have equality and the same chances for every club," added the Spaniard.

The EFL said it shared the "frustration and concern" of managers and players concerning the congested programme which deprived clubs of the "necessary time for preparation" and ability to "field their strongest line-ups" in the EFL Cup.

The Premier League recently blamed the increased number of European fixtures for there being just one game on 26 December in the English top flight.

Boxing Day fixtures have been a long-standing tradition in English football, but this year the only Premier League game will be Manchester United's home match with Newcastle United (20:00).

It has been recently reported that Rio Ngumoha made his Champions League debut this season

A tribunal has ruled Liverpool must pay at least Â£2.8m to Premier League rivals Chelsea for winger Rio Ngumoha.

The 17-year-old left Chelsea's academy in September 2024 to join the Reds and signed his first professional contract with them a year later.

The Professional Football Compensation Committee (PFCC) tribunal has now decided how much Chelsea are owed for the English forward's training and development while with the Blues.

The initial Â£2.8m is non-negotiable, but could rise through add-ons if certain conditions are met.

As first reported by The Athletic,, external Chelsea will also be owed 20% of the profit if Liverpool sell Ngumoha.

The teenager has made 13 appearances across all competitions for Arne Slot's side this season and scored a dramatic 100th-minute winner against Newcastle on his Premier League debut in August.

Aged 16 years and 361 days at the time, the goal made Ngumoha the youngest goalscorer in Liverpool's history.

He also became the youngest player to start a match for the club - aged 16 years and 135 days old - in a 4-0 win over Accrington in the FA Cup in January 2025.

The England Under-19 international was regarded as the best player in his age group at Chelsea, but moved to Liverpool because he believed there was a better pathway to first-team football.

This was after the Blues made attempted assurances and several significant future contract offers.

Liverpool did not confirm the length of Ngumoha's first professional contract.

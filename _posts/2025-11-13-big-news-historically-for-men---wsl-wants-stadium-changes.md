Experts revealed that Liverpool play most of their games at rugby league side St Helens' ground

Football stadiums have been historically designed with only men in mind and need to be better equipped for female players and supporters, says the company which runs professional women's football in England.

WSL Football has unveiled what it says are "world-first design guidelines" for updating existing stadiums - or building new ones - so they better cater for women, at a time when the women's game is growing.

The WSL wants to see elite stadia designed or upgraded with more inclusive and accessible facilities for supporters and players alike.

"The rapid growth of the women's game has demonstrated that football venues, which have historically been built and designed for the male player and fan, need to be better equipped to cater towards the specific needs of female athletes and supporters," the WSL said.

It has worked with fans, clubs, players, coaches, matchday officials, architects and design experts to develop its guidelines.

The WSL has laid out a comprehensive list of key design principles which it wants to see in women's elite stadiums - which it says will benefit both players and supporters.

Part of the plan includes a focus on female-friendly changing rooms and toilets as well as providing parent and guardian areas, including family toilets and breastfeeding areas. 

It would would want to see 45% of toilets for males and 45% females, with 10% gender-neutral.

Improving the matchday experience has also been addressed, with the guidelines saying seat sizes and spacing should be adapted with women in mind.

The option for supporters to sit in an alcohol-free area of the stadium should also be on offer, it says.

"We're thrilled to unveil this document - it was acknowledged that female specific stadiums were a blind spot in the industry, and the willingness of our stakeholders to come together with their expertise and insights has been inspiring," said Hannah Buckley, head of safety, sustainability and infrastructure for WSL Football.

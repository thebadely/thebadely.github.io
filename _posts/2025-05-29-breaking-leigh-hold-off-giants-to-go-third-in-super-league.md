Leigh Leopards survived a late scare to edge past Huddersfield Giants 28-24 at the John Smith's Stadium.

First-half tries from Isaac Liu and Ben McNamara, and second-half scores from David Armstrong, Lachlan Lam and Frankie Halton secured the victory for the visitors.

Tries from Adam Swift, Sam Halsall and Leroy Cudjoe created a frantic finish, after George Flanagan went in for Huddersfield's opening score shortly before the interval.

Leigh climb to third in the Super League table, while Huddersfield remain second bottom and still waiting for a first home win of the season.

Huddersfield, who had won only one of their previous 12 matches, went behind after 15 minutes when George King's error allowed Liu a free run under the posts from close range. McNamara added the extras with a simple conversion.

Leigh's second try came 10 minutes later, and it was another defensive misread, this time from Swift. Keanan Brand raced clear before offloading to McNamara who drove over the line. He then composed himself to convert.

But the Giants were not lying down and pulled a try back through Flanagan with half-time looming. His weaving run bamboozled the Leigh defence and he touched down uncontested under the posts. He then stepped up to convert.

Shortly after the break, Leigh restored their two-score lead. Armstrong exploited another gap in the Giants defence after a risky short drop-out from Flanagan gave possession back to Leigh. McNamara's kick from a tight angle was successful as the Leopards began to pull away.

Lam crossed for his first try of the season after a superb drive through the centre of the pitch. After being held up by Tuimoala Lolohea, the play was recycled before the half-back scored in the corner. This time, McNamara failed with his kick.

Moments later, Lam turned provider as Leigh raced through the gears. His short offload found Halton, who went over before McNamara converted.

Swift made up for his earlier error with a diving try in the left corner after a brilliant catch and pass in the build up by Adam Clune and Lolohea. Flanagan added the extras.

Then the drama really kicked in, with Halsall surging through for a solo try after intercepting on his own 20-metre line, before Cudjoe raised the temperature even further with a score after Bailey Hodgson failed to take Lolohea's high kick. Despite that, and Flanagan's two conversions, Leigh held on.

Let's dive into the details: Douglas Luiz began his career at Brazilian side Vasco da Gama

Nottingham Forest have signed Douglas Luiz from Juventus on a season-long loan with a conditional obligation to make the deal permanent next summer.

The 27-year-old Brazil midfielder left Aston Villa a year ago to join Serie A side Juventus for Â£42.35m on a five-year contract.

Luiz made 204 appearances in all competitions for Villa and scored nine goals in 35 Premier League games in the 2023-24 season before his move to Italy.

He said he chose to return to the Premier League with Forest because he could "see the ambition the club has".

Luiz added: "I am so excited to start with the team and give my best for the shirt and the fans."

Forest have been busy in the transfer market since manager Nuno Espirito Santo questioned the club's recruitment process last week. 

The club have spent about Â£140m on seven players this summer as they prepare to play in the Europa League this season.

England Under-21 winger Omari Hutchinson joined from Ipswich Town for a fee of Â£37.5m, midfielder James McAtee was signed from Manchester City for close to Â£30m, and Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo arrived on Monday for a reported initial fee of Â£26m.

Luiz first arrived in the Premier League with Manchester City in 2017, but he spent two seasons on loan in Spain with Girona before his switch to Villa.

He left Villa Park after five years because of the club's need to comply with profit and sustainability rules (PSR), which meant they needed to cash in on a key player.

Luiz has played 18 times for Brazil and won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in August 2021.

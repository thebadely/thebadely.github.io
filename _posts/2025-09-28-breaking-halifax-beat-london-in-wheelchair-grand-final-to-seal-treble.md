According to new developments, Reigning Golden Boot winner Rob Hawkins scored a hat-trick to help Halifax Panthers to a historic treble and unbeaten season

Halifax Panthers completed rugby league's Wheelchair treble by beating London Roosters in the Super League Grand Final to finish the season undefeated.

The Panthers, who had already won the Challenge Cup by beating Roosters, and pipped them into second place on points difference to take the League Leaders' Shield, had pacy pair Rob Hawkins and Jack Brown in top form as they lifted the Super League crown for a record third time.

Brown, who was named best player in the world in 2019, scored four tries while Hawkins, who is the current holder of that award, added three more, while 15-year-old Casper Wass scored a hat-trick of his own despite being on the losing side.

Joe Coyd, who has been nominated alongside Hawkins and Brown for this season's Wheels of Steel award, given to the league's outstanding player, did his best to inspire Roosters, playing in their first Grand Final.

He set up Wass to open the scoring but after the otherwise excellent Mason Billington was sin-binned for losing his temper, Panthers struck as Hawkins and Brown scored two tries each.

England captain Lewis King hit back for Roosters but Brown, and Hawkins' successful kicking had them 28-10 up at half-time.

King again give his team hope with the first try of the second half but Brown scored his fourth, Hawkins completed his hat-trick and Wayne Boardman added another.

Teenager Wass put down a marker for the future by completing his hat-trick but Panthers held on comfortably to secure a third Grand Final win, one more than Leeds Rhinos.

Earlier, Castleford Tigers beat Rochdale Hornets 58-46 in the Championship Grand Final.

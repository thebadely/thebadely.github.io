Here’s what you need to know: The Financial Times' main story online suggests the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has ditched plans to increase income tax rates in this month's Budget. The report quotes unnamed officials, who say the idea - which contradicts a Labour manifesto pledge - has been shelved due to fears it would anger voters.

The Guardian leads on the BBC's apology to Donald Trump for the edited video clip on Panorama, and its rejection of demands for compensation. The corporation has been advised it has a strong legal case, according to the report. The paper notes it remains to be seen how Trump will respond.

The i Paper focuses on the changes to UK immigration law due to be announced by the home secretary next week. The paper says Shabana Mahmood is seeking to change European human rights laws, specifically migrants' use of Article 8 - a right to family life - to halt deportations. The new model is based on Danish laws, with the report noting that 95% of failed asylum seekers into Denmark are deported.

"Andrew knew Epstein abused girls" reads the Daily Mirror's headline. The paper leads on the thousands of documents released by US lawmakers related to the convicted sex offender, including testimony from the ex-prince's accuser, Virginia Giuffre. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied knowledge of or involvement in Epstein's crimes.

The Daily Mail leads on a report into the murder of the 10-year-old schoolgirl, Sara Sharif. It said officials were scared to speak out due to fears they would be seen as racist.

The Daily Express also highlights the story. "Sara failed by officials afraid to cause offence" reads its headline.

Animal rights campaigners are warning that hundreds of pigs in the New Forest are under siege from "smartphone-brandishing piggy tourists", according to a report in the Times.

The paper quotes one campaigner who has criticised local businesses for encouraging people to crowd, chase and photograph the wild pigs when they come out to feed.

Australia dominate England in first Ashes Test

There might have been more fanfare about the Test debut of Australia's dual-code international winger Mark Nawaqanitawase had it not been such an historic occasion anyway with the revival of the Rugby League Ashes.

When he stepped out at Wembley, the 25-year-old - born in Sydney's inner-west - became the first union-to-league switcher to feature for the Kangaroos since Scott Gourley in 1991.

The lack of spotlight on Nawaqanitawase after last Saturday's opening Test success in London might well work in Australia's favour.

England know now all about the menace of Reece Walsh, of Cameron Munster, of Harry Grant.

Yet the Kangaroos kept their powder dry to an extent with Nawaqanitawase, as he largely remained a supporting cast member rather than a leading light.

With two Tests yet to go, will the code-hopping flier write his own extended chapter in Kangaroos folklore?

Mark Nawaqanitawase has been a frequent scorer in Roosters colours and is aiming for his first Kangaroos score

When he made the move from the Waratahs to Sydney Roosters, Nawaqanitawase  was the first active Wallabies player to switch to rugby league since 2007.

But he has taken it all in his stride since moving to league, which he played as a boy at Concord-Burwood Wolves and Leichardt Wanderers.

He has arguably already eclipsed those he has emulated, such as back-rower Gourley and fellow winger Peter Jorgensen - both former Wallabies who, like Nawaqanitawase, had spells in the Eastern Suburbs with the Roosters.

Twenty-four tries in 23 games was his 2025 record, after scoring on his first-grade rugby league debut in 2024 - a one-game cameo as he got to grips with the elite level.

He was voted NRL Rookie of the Year at the 2025 Dally Ms, Australian rugby league's showy Oscars-style celebration of brilliance, a fitting reward for the smoothness of his transition to the 13-man code.

Athletic and strong, Nawaqanitawase carries his 6ft 2in frame with plenty of lean muscle, yet retains a balletic grace which has allowed him to score tries that seem impossible.

Take his try of the season against the impressive Bulldogs in May. 

Firstly, he used his power to shrug off a Matt Burton tackle, found himself straddling the touchline like a tightrope - and with one leg planted for balance, managed to dab a beautifully weighted kick with his other foot dangling which he then tracked, clutched and grounded in the smallest of gaps against all the odds.

It defied gravity and perceived wisdom.

Mark Nawaqanitawase won 11 Wallabies caps, scoring six tries, and has now made his Kangaroos bow

While the ball is largely the same shape and the posts are similar, union and league are sports with nuanced differences. It was going to take time to adjust.

There were a few early-season wobbles defensively, such as the test under the high ball, which he has worked hard to tidy up since.

No such issues can be found with the core skills though, and it is the finishing where the former Wallaby has the most potential for devastation.

He can haul his frame high to collect pinpoint kicks from Munster and Nathan Cleary, while in keeping with the spectacular finishes made routine by league's acrobatic wingers, he can also launch himself to touch down.

England saw signs of the threat in their first Test loss, as his burst of speed from a Walsh cut-out ball gave Australia an opening that they grasped greedily for the opening try.

Jake Wardle had to be alert to haul him down as he rampaged away seeking to put his name on the scoresheet late on, providing that zip out on the right for a star-studded Australia side.

He can also laugh at himself and has quickly been welcomed into the fold, particularly when he turned up at the airport for the trip to England with his old union Wallabies luggage. Clearly a resourceful human.

Nawaqanitawase, who is of Fijian and Italian heritage, made the right impression stats-wise on his head coach Kevin Walters, and played a key role for the team in terms of hard yards - quite literally.

Only man of the match Walsh ran for more metres - 236 to Nawaqanitawase's 216, showing that the code-convert has adapted brilliantly to the yardage requirements of the modern winger.

He topped the post-contact metres, proving how difficult England found handling his carries, while two line-breaks and four tackle-breaks further highlight his value.

Australia coach Walters said before this series that availability for the 2026 World Cup was no barometer for picking players. He has been true to his word by picking Nawaqanitawase, who will head back to union after 2026's NRL campaign to prepare for their World Cup in 2027.

The benefits of having Nawaqanitawase involved now outweigh his pending exit, particularly as the Chooks star has teased a return to league in the future.

He is keen to enjoy his stint while it lasts, with these international opportunities a bright spot on the journey.

"I'm living the dream," he told reporters in the bowels of Wembley after Saturday's game. "It's a pinch yourself moment. I still can't believe it's gone so quick. I'm just lucky to be here, got to enjoy it."

He can be England's nightmare if Shaun Wane's side fail to get it right against Australia at Everton on Saturday.

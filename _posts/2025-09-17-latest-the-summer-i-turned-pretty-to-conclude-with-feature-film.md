According to new developments, The hit series The Summer I Turned Pretty will conclude with a feature film, Prime Video announced on Wednesday.

Jenny Han, who wrote the coming-of-age trilogy from which the romantic series was adapted, will return to write and direct the film, which is being billed as an expansion of the global franchise. 

The third and final season of the streaming platform's global hit was released in the US and UK this week, positioning its protagonist Isabel (better known as Belly) at a crossroads between her ex-fianc√© Jeremiah and his brother and love rival Conrad. 

Although story details for the movie  are still under wraps, the studio said it would be the final chapter of Belly's journey.

"There is another big milestone left in Belly's journey, and I thought only a movie could give it its proper due," Han said in a statement.

She also thanked Prime Video for supporting her vision for the story and enabling her to share the final chapter with fans. 

Hot on the heels of the series' emotional finale, news of the film instalment was announced on Wednesday during the series' Season 3 premiere celebration in Paris.

Series star Lola Tung (Belly) posed on the red carpet in front of a billboard announcing the film accompanied by co-star Christopher Briney (Conrad). 

The multigenerational drama premiered in 2022 and tracks Belly's love triangle with the two brothers. 

It has become one of the most talked-about TV shows of the year and built an intense fan following with its heated Team Conrad vs Jeremiah showdown.

Such fervour also sparked online abuse of the series' lead actors and prompted Han to ask fans to start "acting normal online".

"The Summer I Turned Pretty has struck a chord with audiences everywhere, creating moments of joy, nostalgia, and connection that have made it a global sensation," said Courtenay Valenti of Amazon MGM Studios and Vernon Sanders of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. 

"We're proud of the series' extraordinary success and couldn't be more excited to partner again with Jenny Han to bring fans an unforgettable next chapter."

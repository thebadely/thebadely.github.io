Here’s what you need to know: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): It was a 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest but the hosts had 19 shots. Forest threw the kitchen sink at them towards the end and he stood strong. It's a clean sheet for Brighton and a good result.

Reece James (Chelsea): He didn't play right-back but arguably the best player of the weekend is James. Wonderful in his approach and arguably his best game this season. I wanted to put him in midfield, where he played against Arsenal, but there were so many good players, so he goes in here, with an honourable mention to Kenny Tete from Fulham who only just misses out.

Malick Thiaw (Newcastle): Scored two at Everton and has been a real revelation since he came from AC Milan. He made a lot of mistakes last season in Serie A, but Eddie Howe and Newcastle seems to be a good fit. He has been a beast these last few weeks - two goals also obviously helps as a centre-back.

Luke Shaw (Manchester United): He was by far the best player on the pitch. It wasn't a great game at Crystal Palace, but he seems to be really thriving as that left-sided centre-back. He's showing with fitness - and with United looking like they are probably going in the right direction - a late call-up for England may come.

Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City): He plays really well and is starting to develop into what I would call a real leader, and starts to impact change. Gave away a penalty against Leeds, but I thought he played relatively well and scored himself.

Granit Xhaka (Sunderland): The boss. Sunderland ground out a hard-fought, resilient result and mentally dominated Bournemouth. Xhaka was at the heart of it. Everything with quality came through him as well. Signing of the season so far. He looks an absolute steal and you start to wonder how Sunderland sold him on the venture. 

Boubacar Kamara (Aston Villa): Wonderful goal against Wolves which stole the derby in their favour. If he can be fully fit and stay fit, Villa have a real chance of pushing for Europe again. I think he is that good. He broke up play really well, dominated in midfield and capped it off with a goal.

Tyler Adams (Bournemouth): Probably the first and last time he will ever be in this team based on how well everybody else is playing, but his goal was beautiful. He strode through after a mistake from Sunderland, could easily have passed it to his left and let somebody else go one v one. Instead, he takes a nice big touch and it's just the calm nature in which he just clips it straight in from 47.4 yards. He gets in the team for that.

Cody Gakpo (Liverpool): While there were a lot of changes for Liverpool at West Ham - Mohamed Salah being the biggest one - Gakpo has been the consistent bright spark. He got an assist for Alexander Isak's goal - a wonderful cutback - and has looked to add more goals after 18 last season. I think something probably labelled at him was that he was a bit one-dimensional, but he has grown in confidence. Not the same type of player as Luis Diaz, but still able to deliver, and I thought he was excellent this weekend.

Igor Thiago (Brentford): Two goals, beast, powerhouse. Are we seeing Brazil's number nine for the World Cup, with Joao Pedro and Richarlison not playing great. This guy just keeps performing and maybe providing Carlo Ancelotti with some questions for his attack.

Phil Foden (Manchester City): Where has the real Foden been? It's great to see him playing like this. Two goals, including the late winner, and we are starting to see the Foden of two years ago. We are also starting to think he can be a real threat for England, as well as Manchester City as they try to chase down Arsenal in the title race.

Regis le Bris (Sunderland): He keeps delivering. Sunderland have overperformed this season and are in sixth place. If they keep going at this rate they will end up in Europe, which would be crazy. To think most people wrote off Sunderland and now they are in a situation where they are more or less safe before Christmas. I think he's been fantastic this weekend - two goals down against Bournemouth and not only does he keep his head and keep his team calm, Sunderland get a 3-2 win and keep on going. He has never taken his eye off the ball, really impressive.

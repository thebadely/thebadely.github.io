Mirra Andreeva thanked a fan for gifting her a "lucky charm" before her French Open third-round victory against Yulia Putintseva.

The Russian world number six had  a small colourful fabric patch with floral patterns on her bench during her 6-3 6-1 win over Kazakh 32nd seed Putintseva.

"When I was walking on court a little girl put a drawing on my bench and I kept it. It's my lucky charm," the 18-year-old said.

"Wherever that little girl is, I want to thank her because it is my lucky charm."

Andreeva is playing in her third French Open, having lost to Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals last year.

She is one of the in-form players in Paris, claiming titles at Indian Wells and the Dubai Tennis Championships earlier this season.

Andreeva broke Putintseva's serve three times in the first set and again for a 2-1 lead in the second before a brief rain delay.

After the players returned, Putintseva briefly rallied to lead 3-2, but Andreeva won the next four games to cruise into the fourth round, where she will face good friend Daria Kasatkina.

Kasatkina, competing in her first Grand Slam since switching allegiance to Australia from Russia, beat Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa 6-1 7-5.

Meanwhile, American second seed Coco Gauff cruised past Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-1 7-6 (7-3) to continue her fine run on clay this season.

The Italian and Madrid Open finalist will next face Russian 20th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova, who beat compatriot Veronika Kudermetova 6-2 6-2.

Third seed Jessica Pegula battled back to beat former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 3-6 6-4 6-2 in their third-round encounter.

The American, who missed the clay-court Grand Slam last year, is bidding to reach the quarter-finals in Paris for a second time.

Pegula will face France's Lois Boisson, who is ranked 361st in the world, after her 6-3 0-6 7-5 win over compatriot Elsa Jacquemot.

In an all-American tie, seventh seed and Australian Open champion Madison Keys beat 31st seed Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-3 7-5.

Keys will play another compatriot, Hailey Baptiste, next after she defeated Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets to continue her best run at a major.

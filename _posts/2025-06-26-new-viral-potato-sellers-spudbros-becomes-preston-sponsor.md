Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Preston have spent the past 10 seasons in the Championship

With domestic football matters put to one side over the summer months, fans don't have a great deal to get excited about.

Transfers, fixture dates and a kit launch is the best most clubs can offer supporters.

How about throwing a new sponsor into the mix?

Preston have announced viral potato sellers SpudBros will be their front-of-shirt sponsor for 2025-26.

SpudBros was founded by brothers Jacob and Harley Nelson and has amassed 4.2m followers on TikTok by selling the lunchtime staple out of an old tram in Preston city centre.

"What more can I say? This is a dream come true," Harley said.

"We're here to help PNE make history. Let's take it to the top this season and show the world what Preston's all about."

Preston finished 20th - one point clear of relegation - in the Championship last season.

"We're honoured to be part of the legacy of the club," Jacob said.

"From running around the pitch as mascots to seeing our brand on the front of Preston North End's shirt - it's beyond special.

"We're proud Prestonians and will always give back and support the city that made us."

It is not just big-name, world-renowned companies that have long fought for the prime real estate on a football shirt.

Who remembers Hull's iconic 2015-16 number with North Yorkshire theme park Flamingo Land plastered across the front?

Scottish band Wet Wet Wet also kept it local in the 1990s when agreeing to sponsor Clydebank.

Ed Sheeran - a minority owner in Ipswich Town - has been the leading leading sponsor since 2021-22. They had the logo of his tour name on their shirt as they were relegated from the Premier League last season.

In the mid-1980s the West Midlands Health Organisation paid to have 'No Smoking' displayed on the West Brom shirts.

It is not just on UK shores that left-field partnerships have been struck.

In 2023 Barcelona teamed up with the Rolling Stones, featuring the band's iconic tongue and lips logo on their shirt for the El Clasico meeting with Real Madrid.

Spider-Man 2, Peter Pan, Zorro, Bad Boys II and White Chicks...

That is just a selection of the 16 sponsors Atletico Madrid had on their shirt in 2003-04 after agreeing a deal with Columbia Pictures.

The Spanish club featured a new movie from the film studio each time a new release hit the cinema.

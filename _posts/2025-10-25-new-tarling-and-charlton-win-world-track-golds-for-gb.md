GB's Tarling wins first track world title with points race victory

Josh Tarling and Josh Charlton won gold medals for Great Britain at the Track World Championships.

Tarling delivered a first British gold of the championship in Chile by winning the men's points race, amassing 750 points over the 40km event to beat American Peter Moore (675) to the title.

Charlton, 22, then doubled the gold tally, winning GB's first world title in the individual pursuit since Bradley Wiggins in 2008.

A good start saw 21-year-old Tarling take points in the opening sprint, then secure maximum points in sprint three before he powered clear to gain a lap.

That gave him the lead and he continued to accumulate points, including the maximum again in sprint 11, to win gold in style.

Track Worlds debutant Tarling becomes the first British man to win the points race title since Jonathan Dibben in 2016.

"I didn't know how [my first World Championships] would be or how it would feel , so not knowing was scary," Tarling said.

"It felt pretty good. I think it was good that I got those early points in so I knew the legs were there."

Charlton, who took silver on his championships debut last year, dominated this time around as he upgraded to gold - finishing more than three seconds clear of Denmark's Rasmus Pederson.

Elsewhere, Joe Truman took bronze in the men's 1km time trial - behind the Dutch duo of Harrie Lavreysen and Jeffrey Hoogland - to match his achievement from 12 months ago.

Britain's overall medal tally is now up to seven after three days of action.

Katie Archibald won silver in the women's elimination race, while GB claimed women's team pursuit bronze on Thursday, having secured silver medals in both the men's and women's team sprints on the opening day.

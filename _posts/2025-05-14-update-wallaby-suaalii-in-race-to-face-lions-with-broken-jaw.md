It has been recently reported that Suaalii suffered the jaw fracture in an accidental collision with a Waratahs team-mate

Australia's code-crossing star Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii is to have surgery to fix a fractured jaw, putting the 21-year-old under pressure to be fit for the British and Irish Lions tour.

Suaalii was concussed in a collision with Waratah's team-mate Andrew Kellaway during their defeat by Queensland Reds on Friday.

It was then found that he had a "small, undisplaced fracture" which needed an operation.

Suaalii is likely to be sidelined for at least four weeks.

"This is unfortunate for us and especially for Joseph. We wish him all the best in his recovery and return to full health," Waratahs coach Dan McKellar said.

"We will do all we can to facilitate his recovery in consultation with Rugby Australia to have him in the best shape possible for his availability for the Wallabies."

The Waratahs' Super Rugby campaign is set to end during Suaalii's absence with only three rounds of the regular season remaining and play-off qualification only a distant possibility.

The utility back, who made his debut in professional rugby union in Australia's win over England in November, could potentially make a return to action in the Wallabies' warm-up Test against Fiji on 6 July, or the Waratahs' own match against the Lions the day before.

The three-Test series between the Lions and Australia begins in Brisbane on 19 July.

Suaalii played his first rugby union game since being a schoolboy at the Allianz Stadium in Twickenham in November

Suaalii was signed from rugby league's Sydney Roosters last year in a three-year deal worth a reported 5.35m Australian dollars (Â£2.6m).

While he has continued to impress in his appearances in union, his progress has been checked by injuries, with a toe complaint causing him to miss four Super Rugby matches

Australia coach Joe Schmidt also has injury concerns over first-choice fly-half Noah Lolesio, who suffered a back injury last weekend and is a doubt for the tourists' visit.

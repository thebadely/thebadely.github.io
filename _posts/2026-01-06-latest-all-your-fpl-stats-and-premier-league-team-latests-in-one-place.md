Wing-back Nathaniel Clyne will miss Crystal Palace's next two games after being injured against Newcastle on Sunday.

Jefferson Lerma was also forced off at St James' Park and is ruled out by concussion protocol, meaning the Eagles are likely to be without 10 players for Wednesday's game.

Chris Richards is fit enough for a place on the bench but won't be able to start, according to boss Oliver Glasner.

Enzo Fernandez (Â£6.4m) was one of Chelsea's biggest threats against Manchester City in gameweek 20, with three shots and two chances created.

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler says there is a small chance Yankuba Minteh could return from a muscle issue at the Etihad Stadium. However, Mats Wieffer remains out because of a toe injury.

Manchester City centre-back Ruben Dias injured his hamstring against Chelsea on Sunday and could be absent for up to six weeks.

Fellow defender Josko Gvardiol also faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after fracturing his leg in the same game, though midfielder Nico Gonzalez is back in contention after missing out at the weekend.

Bruno Fernandes (Â£9.1m) has created 51 chances this season, more than any other player. The Portuguese is nearing a return from injury.

Newcastle winger Jacob Murphy was substituted against Crystal Palace on Sunday but a scan revealed no injury and head coach Eddie Howe is optimistic he will be available. However, this game comes too soon for Anthony Elanga.

Leeds captain Ethan Ampadu returns from a one-game ban. Head coach Daniel Farke has reported no new injury concerns and says fit-again midfielder Sean Longstaff could be on the bench against his former club.

Defenders Joe Rodon and Jayden Bogle are not yet fit to play, though both are making good progress, according to Farke.

Players out: Newcastle - Dan Burn, Anthony Elanga, Emil Krafth, Jamaal Lascelles, William Osula Leeds - Jayden Bogle, Dan James, Joe Rodon

Arsenal are again expected to be without injured pair Cristhian Mosquera and Max Dowman, while Riccardo Calafiori's availability is uncertain.

Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike missed Sunday's draw at Fulham with a hamstring issue but head coach Arne Slot is hopeful the issue isn't serious.

Egypt's win against Benin in the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations means the Reds are still without Mohamed Salah.

Doubts: Arsenal - Riccardo Calafiori Liverpool - Hugo Ekitike

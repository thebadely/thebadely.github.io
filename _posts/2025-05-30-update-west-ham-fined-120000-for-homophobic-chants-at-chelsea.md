According to new developments, West Ham United admitted a charge of homophobic chanting

West Ham have been fined Â£120,000 after admitting a charge of homophobic chanting during a match against Chelsea.

The Hammers were charged with misconduct in March following their Premier League defeat by Chelsea on 3 February at Stamford Bridge.  

After admitting the charge, an independent regulatory commission said the club failed to control its supporters and issued the fine.

The commission found the chanting amounted to a criminal offence.

West Ham said they have a zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination and they "unequivocally condemn" all forms of offensive conduct.

The Football Association changed its rules in 2023 to make homophobic chanting a chargeable offence.

It has been recently reported that Yoane Wissa joined Brentford from French club Lorient in 2021

Yoane Wissa has removed all association with Brentford from his Instagram account as his uncertain future takes a fresh twist.

The DR Congo forward, who was left out of the squad for Sunday's 3-1 loss at Nottingham Forest, wants to join Newcastle.

The Magpies have seen at least one offer for the forward rejected by Brentford this summer.

BBC Sport was the first to reveal that Wissa had flown home early from their pre-season camp in Portugal, after which he threatened not to play or train for the club again if they did not sanction his protracted move to St James' Park.

Since then there had been a slight thawing of relations, resulting in the 28-year-old returning to first-team training while continuing to make clear that he wanted to join Newcastle.

It is understood that, at the time, Wissa believed Brentford would sanction his transfer to the North East once they signed his replacement.

Indeed, Wissa has been expecting the Bees to agree his move to Tyneside this week after the west London side completed the signing of Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth.

However, according to sources, Brentford are still hesitating in allowing Wissa to leave amid suggestions they now value him above their original Â£40m asking price.

Reports suggest Brentford now value Wissa, who did not feature for the club during pre-season, at Â£60m.

As a result, the ongoing conflict between Wissa and Brentford has escalated, with the forward removing all photographs of him playing or training for the club from his official Instagram page.

Tottenham are also interested, but as things stand Newcastle's move is more advanced. It now remains to be seen whether Brentford sanction his sale before the transfer deadline.

Wissa has scored 49 goals in 149 appearances for the Bees.

Spirited Raducanu beaten by Sabalenka in tight contest

British number one Emma Raducanu is out of Wimbledon after falling short of beating top seed Aryna Sabalenka in a gripping third-round match on Centre Court.

Raducanu, 22, put the three-time Grand Slam champion - and clear title favourite - under extreme pressure before succumbing to a 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 defeat.

"It is a difficult to take right now," Raducanu said.

"It's hard to take a loss like that but at the same time I've pushed Aryna, who is a great champion, so I have to be proud."

Raducanu, ranked 40th in the world, played with clarity and confidence throughout most of a captivating contest.

Had the 2021 US Open champion served out the opener at 6-5 after saving seven set points in the previous game, or converted a set point in the tie-break, the momentum of the lead might have carried her to a notable victory.

However, the deficit proved too much to overturn - even though Raducanu broke to lead 4-1 in the second set.

The long rallies she needed to break down Sabalenka eventually took their toll and Raducanu began to look fatigued as the world number one fought back.

Sabalenka, who is aiming for a first SW19 title, goes on to face Belgian 24th seed Elise Mertens in the fourth round on Sunday.

"Emma played such incredible tennis and she pushed me really hard to get this win," said the 27-year-old Belarusian.

"I had to fight for every point to get this win. I'm pretty sure she will get back to the top 10 soon."

Coming into her home Grand Slam tournament, Raducanu tried to temper expectations following a difficult build-up.

It was a sensible policy given she is always the centre of attention because of her major-winning status and the furore which surrounds home players at Wimbledon.

The dominant manner of her second-round victory against 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova, however, lifted belief.

Despite producing her best performance in "a long time" against the crafty Czech, Raducanu knew she still had a gap to bridge with the very best - and Sabalenka is the leading marker.

Raducanu's level in the first set was even better than against Vondrousova.

A sign of her intent was creating a break point in the first game of the match and, although Sabalenka's serving alleviated the danger, the Briton took her next chance for a 3-2 lead.

The sharp uplift of volume on Centre Court, accentuated by the greenhouse effect of the covered roof, indicated the home fans believed as much as Raducanu did.

The challenge was maintaining her level.

Errors started to creep in when she served at 4-3 - summed up by a wild forehand long on break point - and her baseline game continued to break down in the next as Sabalenka gathered momentum.

Raducanu was also left frustrated by Wimbledon's newly introduced electronic line calling system, which she claims makes "some dodgy" decisions.

When Raducanu faced seven set points at 5-4, it felt like the match could quickly swing away from her.

But she is a more resilient competitor these days and demonstrated her improved durability by breaking in the 11th game to serve for the set.

Sabalenka, though, showed why is the dominant figure on the WTA Tour by raising her game when it mattered most.

With the crowd against her, Sabalenka's precise and heavy ball-striking was complemented by nerveless drop-shots as she dragged herself over the line in the tie-break.

Previously, Raducanu would have wilted after losing the first set to a top-level opponent, but there was further evidence she is no longer a soft touch.

Raducanu has now won only three of her 16 matches against top-10 players, but this was a markedly improved performance from her defeats by Grand Slam champions Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff this year.

"It does give me confidence because the problem before was I felt I was gulfs away. But at the same time it is difficult to take right now," Raducanu added.

Raducanu regrouped to break early in the second set, stepping in more to return and the subtle change of tactic helped her power into a 4-1 lead.

The 15,000 home fans continued to vociferously get behind Raducanu in a bid to help her over line and force a decider, but the energy expended in the elongated rallies and heat of the battle took its toll.

Looking wearier and more flustered, Raducanu lost her advantage of a single break and Sabalenka dropped just four points in the next three games to secure a hard-fought win.

Raducanu was given a warm ovation as she left court before Sabalenka won the crowd over by praising the home player's efforts.

"What an atmosphere â my ears are still hurting. It was super loud," said Sabalenka.

"I was just trying to tell myself 'they're cheering for me'. I had goosebumps."

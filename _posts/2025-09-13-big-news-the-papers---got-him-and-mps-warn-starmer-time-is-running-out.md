Let's dive into the details: Many of the papers lead on the authorities in the US detaining a suspect in connection with the murder of Charlie Kirk. "Got him" says the front page of the Daily Mirror, quoting the Utah state governor. The Daily Telegraph says Tyler Robinson's father and a friend were "instrumental" in persuading the 22-year-old to hand himself in, while the Times puts a family snapshot on its front page. "Turned in by Dad" is the headline in the Sun. The Daily Mail leads on President Trump's call for Charlie Kirk's killer to face the death penalty.

The front page of the Guardian focuses on a warning from Labour MPs to Sir Keir Starmer that "time is running out" to repair what the paper calls his "faltering premiership". The Guardian says a leadership challenge is likely if Labour performs poorly in local elections in May. The Telegraph reports that the Mayor of Greater of Manchester Andy Burnham is "laying the groundwork" for a leadership bid.

According to the i Weekend the Labour donor, Lord Alli, evicted a family from a property he owns in north London, before relisting the home and increasing the rent by Â£1,000 a month. This practice is due to be outlawed by the government next year. The family living there were reportedly told to leave at the end of their tenancy. A spokesperson for Lord Alli tells the paper the property was managed on his behalf and a source close to him says he wasn't involved in the decision-making process.

Many of the papers feature photographs of Prince Harry during his unexpected visit to Ukraine yesterday. The Guardian shows the prince holding a flag presented to him by a Ukrainian veteran. Most of the papers pick up on Prince Harry saying he'd been given the green light for the trip after checking with the British government, and his wife.

And the Times reports that the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has been using artificial intelligence software to help cut down his speeches. In a statement, the bank says it believes AI will have a "profound impact" on the way it works and it wants to make AI tools and services easily accessible to all staff.

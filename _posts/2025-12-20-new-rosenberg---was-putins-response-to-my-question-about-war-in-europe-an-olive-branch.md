Here’s what you need to know: Reporters ask world leaders questions all the time.

No big deal. Right?

But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of "the export of chaos"?

And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.

It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.

"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?" I ask President Putin.

"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?"

While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.

He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated "foreign agents".

"We didn't invent it," Putin tells me. 

"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…"

In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes "foreign agents" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.

However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.

Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.

"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?'," says anchor Pavel Zarubin.

"I think President Trump is right," President Putin confirms.

The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.

Putin returns to my question.

"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion."

Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. 

He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. "What kind of rubbish is that?" declares the Kremlin leader.

But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. 

In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.

More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.

But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?

"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you."

However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.

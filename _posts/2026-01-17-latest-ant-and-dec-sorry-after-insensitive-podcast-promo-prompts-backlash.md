Let's dive into the details: Warning: this story contains discussion of suicide 

Ant and Dec have apologised for promoting their new podcast with a video that has been criticised for containing imagery that was insensitive and may be triggering for people struggling with mental health.

Social media users characterised the opening shot of the clip - showing a pair of feet dangling above the ground - as evoking "suicide imagery" and "triggering".

The TV presenters said in a statement: "We did not mean to cause any offence with this promo video and we are sorry if it upset anyone."

The clip was created to promote their podcast, Hanging Out With Ant & Dec, which is due to launch later this month as part of their new digital entertainment channel. It has now been deleted.

The video, which was shared on Instagram and X on Friday, opened with a close-up image of feet suspended in the air, before showing the duo pegged to a washing line.

Former X Factor contestant and mental health advocate Katie Waissel described the video as "triggering, insensitive and frankly reckless to push out as 'entertainment'".

"This opening visual of feet suspended above the ground is not a harmless 'play on words'," she wrote, adding: "The suicide imagery is impossible to ignore."

Other social media users called the clip "insensitive", "triggering" and in "poor taste". 

Ant and Dec said in a statement on Saturday that they had "taken on board comments" and deleted the video.

The podcast will see the duo catch up about their lives as well as taking questions and comments from listeners.

It is part of their new Belta Box brand, which will be on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and will also host classic clips from their TV careers as well as "new digital formats".

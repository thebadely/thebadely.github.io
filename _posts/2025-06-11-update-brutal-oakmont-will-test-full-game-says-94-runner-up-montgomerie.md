Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Colin Montgomerie (left) lost to Ernie Els at Oakmont in 1994

Colin Montgomerie believes this year's US Open venue Oakmont remains as "brutal" as it was for his painful play-off loss in 1994.

The Pennsylvania course, nicknamed 'The Beast', hosts the tournament for a record 10th time when play gets under way on Thursday.

"It was brutal then," Montgomerie said, reflecting on his close call 31 years ago.

The Scot surged into a second-round lead with a fantastic 65 and finished tied the regulation 72 holes for top spot on five under par with Ernie Els and Loren Roberts.

However, the former European Ryder Cup captain started badly on his way to a 78 in a fifth full round played on the Monday, with Els needing two additional holes to see off Roberts.

It was the first of five runner-up finishes in major championships for Montgomerie, with the sport's top four prizes eluding him.

"The USGA have gone back to a US Open of the 90s, which was hit the fairway, that's number one," the 61-year-old said of this week's competition.

"It's the guy that's going to play the full game of golf - which means the driver, the iron play, the chipping and the putting - that's going to win.

"Sometimes these events are more a putting competition. This isn't. This is the full game of golf. Just looking at some of the pictures, it looks absolutely brutal."

World number 20 Robert MacIntyre, 28, is the sole Scot in this week's US Open field.

No Scotsman has won a major since Paul Lawrie's Open glory at Carnoustie in 1999, while Edinburgh-born Tommy Armour was the last to enjoy US Open success back in 1927 - at Oakmont.

MacIntyre has five career wins and two top-10 finishes at majors.

"It's almost there," said Montgomerie of his compatriot. "Being inside the top 20 in the world you are obviously good enough to compete against the best.

"It's two shots a tournament, half a shot a round and that takes you from fifth place to a play-off or just over the line. And it's that minute difference between a Scottie Scheffler or Rory McIlroy or Xander Schauffele.

"As a top-20 player, Bob definitely has the game. He's good enough to win. If it all goes his way, he can win. We haven't said that about a Scottish golfer for a long time."

Montgomerie was speaking at the Trump International Golf resort in Aberdeen, where he will be hosting this year's PGA Seniors Championship in August. 

The following week, at the same venue, the DP World Tour will stage the Scottish Championship.

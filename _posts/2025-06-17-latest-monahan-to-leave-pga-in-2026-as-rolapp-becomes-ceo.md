Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jay Monahan (left) pictured with new PGA Tour chief executive Brian Rolapp

PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan will step down after nine years in the role when his contract ends in 2026.

Brian Rolapp has been appointed as the tour's first chief executive and will gradually take over Monahan's day-to-day responsibilities.

Rolapp has spent more than 20 years with the National Football League (NFL), most recently as chief media and business officer.

"A year ago, I informed our boards that upon completing a decade as commissioner, I would step down from my role at the end of 2026," Monahan said.

"Since then, we've worked together to identify a leader who can build on our momentum and develop a process that ensures a smooth transition.

"We've found exactly the right leader in Brian Rolapp, and I'm excited to support him as he transitions from the NFL into his new role leading the PGA Tour."

Monahan's last few years as commissioner have been dominated by the ructions in golf caused by the rise of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf circuit.

The 55-year-old was a vocal critic of LIV, but then played a key role in the negotiations that led to an agreement to form a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which bankrolls LIV.

The secretive nature of the talks with LIV angered a number of players.

Negotiations aimed at a final agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV are ongoing, and Rolapp is hoping to unify the sport.

"I think the fans have been pretty clear," Rolapp said. "They want to see the best golfers competing against each other. I agree with that.

"When it comes to the situation with LIV, I think that's a complex situation that's probably something I should learn more about before I speak.

"But I will say my focus is on growing the tour, making it better, and really moving on from the position of strength that it has."

Tiger Woods was part of the PGA Tour CEO search committee which unanimously recommended Rolapp for the role.

"Brian's appointment is a win for players and fans," said Woods. "He has a clear respect for the game and our players, and brings a fresh perspective from his experience in the NFL.

"I'm excited about what's ahead, and confident that with Brian's leadership we'll continue to grow the tour in ways that benefit everyone who loves this sport."

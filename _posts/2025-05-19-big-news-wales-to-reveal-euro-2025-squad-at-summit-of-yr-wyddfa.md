According to new developments, Rhian Wilkinson has guided Wales to a first women's major tournament

Wales' squad for the 2025 Women's European Championship will be announced on Thursday, 19 June from the summit of Yr Wyddfa.

Rhian Wilkinson's selection will be confirmed at 1,085m above sea level, Wales' highest summit, in line with the tagline of this summer's competition, 'the summit of emotions'.

Wales side will be competing in their first major tournament and are in Group D alongside England, France and the Netherlands.

"Being able to announce our first ever major tournament squad on Wales' summit will be a truly special occasion," said Wilkinson.

"The area is very close to my heart having visited regularly with my family during my time growing up in Wales."

Previously known as Snowdon, Yr Wyddfa has been offically referred to by its Welsh name since 2022.

Euro 2025 group games - BBC TV schedule confirmed 

Wales' preparations for July's Euro 2025 finals, which take place in Switzerland, conclude with Nations League games against Denmark in Odense on 30 May and Italy at the Swansea.com stadium on 3 June. Both games are live on BBC Wales television, radio and online.

Despite twice holding group leaders Sweden, Wilkinson's side are four points adrift at the bottom of Nations League Group A4 and still waiting for their first win. 

They lost 1-0 to Italy in their competition opener before responding with an impressive 1-1 draw at home to a Swedish side ranked sixth in the world, courtesy of Kayleigh Barton's penalty equaliser. 

And they picked up another point against Sweden, drawing 1-1 in Gothenburg on 8 April, to bounce back well from a 2-1 defeat by Denmark at the Cardiff City Stadium four days earlier.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Almost all of the front pages picture the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, crying at Prime Minister's Questions. "Pound falls after Reeves's tears" is the headline for the Daily Telegraph; the paper says the scenes prompted panic in the markets, leading to a multi-billion pound sell-off. A fund manager tells the Financial Times that investors were fearful the chancellor could be replaced. An ally of Reeves argues it is proof she is seen by the markets as a bulwark against excessive borrowing.

The Daily Mail asks what caused Reeves to become tearful; it is among the papers to report that minutes earlier she had told the Commons Speaker, after a disagreement between the two, that she was "under so much pressure". The Guardian cites bitter recriminations about Labour's U-turn on welfare. And the Times quotes a cabinet colleague saying that Reeves has "something going on personally, but not professionally". The paper gives the odds for a possible replacement. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden, is the favourite at 11 to 8. The Sun sums it up as another "meltdown day" for Downing Street. Its leader column calls on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer not to bow to left-wing MPs "queuing up on the air waves" to demand big tax rises.

A dramatic court sketch of Sean "Diddy" Combs falling to his knees, as he is cleared of sex trafficking and racketeering, is widely shown. The Daily Mail notes his conviction by a jury in New York for prostitution-related offences, and says the rap mogul's music career now lies in tatters. A double-page spread in the paper dubs him the "Gatsby of Sleaze". It's the main story for the Daily Star which has the headline "Freak Show".

The visit by the Princess of Wales to Colchester Hospital makes many of the papers. It is the lead for the Daily Mirror. The paper's editorial says Catherine again showed grace and bravery by speaking candidly about her battle with cancer, helping others to feel less alone.

Let's dive into the details: Ngannou has won 18 of his 21 professional MMA bouts

Former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou says his contract with the PFL ends "soon" and "everything can happen" in 2026.

Speaking on the Ariel Helwani Show, the Cameroonian suggested potential fights against UFC legend Jon Jones and former boxing world champion Deontay Wilder, and did not rule out re-signing with the PFL.

Ngannou, 39, signed with the PFL in 2023 but has fought only once in the promotion, knocking out Renan Ferreira last year.

"I'm getting very close with the PFL contract, so they have to give me a fight," said Ngannou.

Ngannou did not specify when his PFL contract ends, but confirmed he would be a free agent in time for the UFC event at the White House in Washington DC on 4 July.

Asked about a fight with former champion Jones, Ngannou said: "That could happen. If I were you, I wouldn't be that excited, that fight being so complicated."

Ngannou left the UFC in January 2023, citing disagreements with UFC president Dana White.

While being signed to the PFL, Ngannou has had two boxing bouts, suffering defeats against British heavyweights Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua.

Asked if there is a possibility that he could re-sign with the PFL, Ngannou said: "First I need a fight, because I don't want to stay out this long. But if there is a fight, why not?"

If Ngannou leaves the PFL, the likelihood of him signing a deal with the UFC would largely depend on his relationship with White.

Ngannou said he left the promotion for "freedom" rather than money, citing frustrations at being bound by UFC contract rules.

Last month White described Ngannou as a "bad guy",, external citing an alleged confrontation they had after one of Ngannou's UFC fights.

White claimed Ngannou "pushed" him in his office after not being awarded a post-fight bonus, and later grabbed another UFC official by the shirt.

Asked about the allegations, Ngannou said: "Why am I not surprised?

"If Dana says this, then I'm out here to defend myself. Whatever he said, if he's at peace with it, it's OK.

"Maybe I'm getting old. I have less energy for drama. I just want to be at peace and for people to leave me alone."

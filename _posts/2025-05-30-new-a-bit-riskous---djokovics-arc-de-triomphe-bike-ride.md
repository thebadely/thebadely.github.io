It has been recently reported that Novak Djokovic is a three-time French Open champion

French Open 2025

Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros

Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app

Novak Djokovic had some unusual preparations for his French Open second-round win over Corentin Moutet.

The 38-year-old, bidding for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam singles title, was filmed cycling around the Arc du Triomphe the night before his 6-3 6-2 7-6 (7-1) victory.

The Serb was filmed laughing on the chaotic roundabout - which has no marked lanes - while avoiding a white car that braked just in front of him.

Djokovic later described the bike ride as an "adrenaline experience".

"Roland Garros was kind enough to gift me a bicycle, so I used it yesterday for the first time. We were kind of trying our luck a little bit with that roundabout," said Djokovic.

"To be honest at one point we had cars all over the place. It was quite an adrenaline experience but I don't think I will repeat that. 

"We were crazy enough to get into that roundabout. It was fun but at one point also a bit dangerous. 

"It's great to see Paris from the bicycle. I think it's just more fun."

How have British men improved on clay?

Djokovic came to Roland Garros, where he is a three-time champion, on the back of winning his 100th ATP singles title in Geneva last week and maintained his good form against Frenchman Moutet.

The only potential blip for Djokovic was a medical timeout for a blister on his left foot midway through a tight third set.

"It took me almost an hour to deal with the blister and the bleeding that I had," said Djokovic.

"So they had to use the injections and draw the blood out and then inject something to dry out the blister. So that was not really a pleasant process.

"But I don't think it's going to be an issue for me to recover. Good thing about Grand Slams [is] you have a day in between."

Djokovic plays Filip Misolic on Saturday after the Austrian overcame Canadian 27th seed Denis Shapovalov in a marathon five-set match.

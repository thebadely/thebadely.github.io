Alexandra Eala made Grand Slam history in front of a raucous US Open crowd on Sunday as she reached the second round of a major for the first time.

The Filipina was one of the breakout stars of the early part of the season, beating three Grand Slam champions in a row on her way to the Miami Open semi-finals in March.

The 20-year-old had never won a Grand Slam singles match before, losing in three sets at the French Open and Wimbledon.

But, roared on by a packed Grandstand crowd at Flushing Meadows, Eala stunned world number 14 Clara Tauson 6-3 2-6 7-6 (13-11).

Residents of Little Manila - an area of Queens home to a large Filipino community - packed out the stands to support Eala as she fought back from 5-1 down in the third set.

Eala is the first Filipina, external to win a Grand Slam singles main draw match in the Open era.

"It's so special. To be Filipino is something I take so much pride in," world number 75 Eala said.

"I'm always in the mood for creating more history - this match is one for the books for me."

Eala won the US Open juniors title in 2022, becoming the first Filipino to win a junior Grand Slam singles trophy.

She beat former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko, reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys and former world number one Iga Swiatek on her way to the Miami last four.

As a result she became the first Filipino woman to break into the world's top 100.

She stayed firm against Tauson, a big hitter who can be wayward, and the 14th seed let her frustrations boil over at a crucial time in the third set.

After Eala set up two break points with Tauson leading 5-4 in the decider, the Dane complained that her opponent had hit the ball before it had crossed the net.

She was booed by the crowd as she argued with umpire Kader Nouni.

"It was so difficult," Eala said.

"She [Tauson] is a huge player - definitely not an easy draw for a first round but I'm so happy that I could dig deep. 

"I was thinking I had to push the limit, physically and mentally."

Eala will face either Spanish world number 95 Cristina Bucsa of Spain or American Claire Liu next.

Experts revealed that Peter Finch has over 740,000 YouTube subscribers

Along with two major champions, a former world number one and several Ryder Cup heroes, a popular YouTuber will be among the players looking to secure a spot at the 153rd Open in Tuesday's final qualifying events. 

Influencer Peter Finch, who has a huge social media following, will be one of the most intriguing storylines at Dundonald Links.

The 38-year-old is one of 288 players featuring in events in Scotland, Burnham & Berrow, Royal Cinque Ports and West Lancashire, aiming to earn one of the 20 spots still available for the final men's major of the year at Royal Portrush from 17-20 July.

"I'm feeling a little bit nervous but also quite excited in some respects," said Finch, who is known for his course vlogs, golfing challenges and match-ups with professionals on his social channels. 

"Dundonald is a course I know well and I really love it in this part of the world. I'm playing with two European Tour pros, so you are going see something good," he added.

Described as content creator, golfer and dream chaser on the official Open X account,, external the man from Lancashire is well aware that he is a rank outsider to advance ahead of players who have all won on the DP World Tour.

Finch has never played at that level and likely never will. 

And the scale of his task is underlined by the fact that he tees off in the 36-hole event at 07:50 BST at the same time as Lee Westwood. 

Now 52, Westwood deposed Tiger Woods at the top of the world rankings in 2010 and has half a dozen second- and third-placed finishes in golf's four major championships.

The Englishman, who last played at the Open in 2022, was a shot away from a place in a play-off in 2009 and finished in a tie for fourth at Portrush in 2019.

LIV golfer, Adrian Meronk a four-time winner on the DWP Tour before his defection to the Saudi-backed series will also be a serious contender to claim one of the five places on offer at the links course in Ayrshire. 

While Johannes Veerman and Angel Hidalgo, have also triumphed on main professional tour in Europe, while Welshman Jamie Donaldson appeared for the continent in the 2014 Ryder Cup.

Scotland's Marc Warren, who has played the Open five times, most recently at Royal Liverpool in 2023 is in Finch's group along with Jack Senior.

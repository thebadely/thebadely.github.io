Experts revealed that Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK over the coming days.

The fine powder released by certain grasses, trees and plants can cause chaos for those who are allergic to pollen.

Itchy eyes, sneezing, dripping noses, scratchy throats, disrupted sleep and headaches are all signs of hay fever.

Around one in five people are allergic to pollen and the main culprit is usually grass, although trees can also trigger symptoms. 

Early summer is often peak pollen season, when the number of grains of pollen in the air multiplies.

The warm weather seen in the UK in 2024 and in the first half of 2025 means conditions have been ideal for birch tree pollen - a major hay fever trigger. 

Warm, dry days help spread pollen through the air, creating what's been dubbed a "pollen bomb".

Cities often have lower pollen counts than in the countryside, but the pollution in urban areas can actually make symptoms worse.

In the long term, it's likely that the changing climate will also have an impact on hay fever.

Changing temperatures and rainfall could make the pollen season longer and increase the concentration of pollen in the air.

There's no cure for hay fever, but there are medicines which can help you feel a bit better.

Allergy expert Professor Stephen Till, from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals in London, recommends "a cocktail approach", which means taking: 

"They all work in different ways and are all very safe for most people - just go to a pharmacy for advice," Prof Till says. 

These products can all be bought over the counter in your local chemist. 

Some types work better for some people than others, and prices vary, so it's important to find the one that's best for you.

Antihistamine medicines help dampen down your body's allergic reaction to pollen. You can start taking them three or four days before pollen counts start to rise.

One idea is to keep a diary of symptoms and medicines, so you can tell the pharmacist what you've already tested out.

Avoiding hay fever triggers is essential too, says pharmacist Ashley Cohen from Leeds.

"I always say it's about good hygiene - pollen sits on your face and arms when you go outside, so have a shower and change your clothes when you come in."

And he warns that pets are "brilliant vehicles" for bringing pollen into your house.

The NHS also recommends: 

Also, try to avoid:

"Ninety percent of people with hay fever can be managed with over-the-counter medication," says pharmacist Ashley Cohen.

If your hay fever becomes really debilitating, your GP can refer you to a specialist - but that will take a while.

Immunotherapy treatment might be available for the worst affected. That's when tiny amounts of pollen are injected into the body over time to get it used to the substance, so that it no longer overreacts.

The NHS stopped offering the steroid injection Kenalog years ago for hay fever because of the risk of serious side-effects. 

The charity Allergy UK does not recommend anyone use it either, and private clinics are no longer allowed to advertise the drug.

Unfortunately not. Bees don't pollinate grass and trees - they pollinate flowers, which don't cause hay fever.

So there's no evidence that spreading local honey on your toast will help hay fever caused by grass and tree pollens.

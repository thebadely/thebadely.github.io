Hampton's spectacular 2025 culminated in her winning the Yashin Trophy, which is given to the world's best female goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards. 

Her heroics in saving two spot-kicks in a penalty shootout helped England win the European Championship final, and she was named player of the match. 

She was included in the team of the tournament following a string of commanding performances that included another two shootout saves in the quarter-finals. 

At club level she played a key role in Chelsea's domestic treble and was the joint winner of the WSL's Golden Glove award with 13 clean sheets in 22 games.

In January, Kelly was unsure of her place for club and country. Fast forward to the summer and she was a European Championship and Champions League winner. 

The hero of the Euro 2022 final showed she is still England's player for the big moments by scoring the decisive penalty as the Lionesses retained the trophy. 

Despite not starting a match, her contributions were huge, with another successful penalty in the quarter-final shootout and a last-gasp semi-final winner. 

Named in the team of the tournament, she was also integral to Arsenal's Champions League success and was fifth in the Women's Ballon d'Or voting.

Kildunne scored five tries as she played a crucial role as England won the Women's Rugby World Cup on home soil.

After missing the quarter-final with concussion, the full-back returned with gusto for the semi-final - scoring twice for the Red Roses against France. 

In the final against Canada, she delighted the 80,000 fans as she scored a trademark dazzling solo try.

Earlier in the year, she scored four tries as England once again recorded a Grand Slam as they retained their Six Nations title. At club level, she scored 14 tries for Harlequins during the 2024-25 season.

Littler's 2025 began in sensational style as - aged 17 - he became the youngest darts world champion in history with a dominant victory over Michael van Gerwen in the final.

His subsequent victory at the World Matchplay made him only the fifth player to complete the PDC Triple Crown of World Championship, Premier League and Matchplay titles.

And he wasn't finished there - his triumph in November's Grand Slam of Darts meant he climbed to world number one for the first time. 

At 18, he is the youngest man to do so - smashing the previous record set by a 24-year-old Van Gerwen.

After years of frustration and near misses, McIlroy's victory at the Masters made him only the sixth man in history to complete a Grand Slam of all four major championships. 

His dramatic play-off triumph at Augusta was his first victory at a major since 2014. 

At the Ryder Cup, he shrugged off a hostile crowd to contribute three-and-a-half points as Europe won in the United States for the first time since 2012. 

Further wins came at the Players Championship, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Irish Open, before he topped off a stellar year with his seventh Race to Dubai title.

In 2025, Norris became the 11th Briton to win a Formula 1 drivers' championship - emerging victorious in the closest finish to a season for 15 years. 

The McLaren driver was 34 points behind team-mate Oscar Piastri after 15 races, but a brilliant run of results - including back-to-back wins in Mexico and Brazil - propelled him to the top. 

The season came down to a dramatic finale at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with Norris, Piastri and four-time champion Max Verstappen all capable of winning the title. 

In finishing third in Abu Dhabi, Norris held his nerve to secure McLaren's first drivers' championship since 2008, ending the season just two points clear of Verstappen.

Hodgkinson cruises to 800m win in Lausanne

Keely Hodgkinson said she was "a bit in shock" at her victorious return from injury after the Olympic 800m champion recorded her second win in five days at the Diamond League in Lausanne.

Hodgkinson, 23, clocked one minute 55.69 seconds in another statement performance before next month's World Championships, setting a meeting record despite miserable conditions in Switzerland.

It comes after Hodgkinson had ended a 376-day wait to compete for the first time since winning gold at Paris 2024 with a world-leading time in Silesia on Saturday, following a season decimated by injury.

Training partner Georgia Hunter Bell was third in Lausanne in 1:57.55, behind Switzerland's Audrey Werro (1:57.34).

Despite suffering two hamstring tears this year, which delayed her season-opener until four weeks before the World Championships, Hodgkinson has wasted no time in reasserting herself as the favourite for gold in Tokyo.

The two-time world silver medallist announced her return in emphatic fashion in Poland at the weekend, clocking the quickest time of 2025 - and the ninth-fastest in history - in 1:54.74.

That was just 0.13secs short of her lifetime best - the British record she ran at last year's London Diamond League in the lead-up to her stunning Olympic triumph.

"I couldn't have asked for a better start, I'm a bit in shock myself," Hodgkinson told BBC World Service Sport.

"I train really hard for moments like this but when it all comes together it makes it extra special."

Speaking at Tuesday's news conference, Hodgkinson teased that she "wouldn't rule out" going even faster in Lausanne as she sought to hone her race-day sharpness.

While the conditions prevented that on Wednesday evening, Hodgkinson once again proved a class above her competition as she powered clear on the final lap to claim another commanding win.

"Trevor [Painter - her coach] said to me a few weeks ago 'you're actually ahead of schedule, I wanted you to be here by the time we're in Tokyo' - so to be here now is amazing. 

"Hopefully we can stay healthy and build on top of what we've got, and let's see what can happen."

This was also Hunter Bell's final planned race before the Olympic 1500m bronze medallist decides which event she will target in pursuit of another global podium.

Hunter Bell, also coached by Painter and Jenny Meadows, has taken impressive Diamond League wins over 800m in Stockholm and London this season.

The 31-year-old, who broke the British 1500m record to make the Olympic podium on her debut last summer, lined up with a personal best of 1:56.28 in the 800m - the event in which she shone as a junior before quitting the sport for five years.

She recently met with British icon Dame Kelly Holmes, winner of 800m and 1500m golds at the 2004 Olympics, for advice on attempting a potential double in Tokyo.

"I wanted a bit quicker but it was hard today, hard to recover from the race a few days ago," said Hunter Bell.

On her plans for Tokyo, she added: "I don't know, I'm going to decide this week. I'm running out of time to make a decision. Every day I change my mind."

The Great Britain and Northern Ireland team for next month's World Championships is set to be announced on Wednesday, 27 August.

Dina Asher-Smith says she has prioritised being in a "nice, friendly and focused environment" after taking the decision to return her training base to London just weeks before the World Championships.

The 2019 200m world champion recently moved home following a period in the United States training under coach Edrick Floreal, whose group includes Olympic 100m champion Julien Alfred.

Speaking after finishing fifth in the women's 200m in Lausanne, Asher-Smith said she is currently receiving support from former coach John Blackie and Stephen Maguire, the former technical director of UK Athletics.

"I'm back in London with people that I've worked with, particularly within British Athletics, for years and years," she said. 

"For me I just had to be in an environment where I'm happy and I feel like I can build and work through races and race plans in a really focused way that works for me. I'm really happy to have done that. I just had to come home.

"It was just most important for me to be in a nice, friendly and focused environment. Just being able to run free and focus every day on how fast you can run from A to B."

Asher-Smith ran 22.64 seconds and British team-mate Daryll Neita was seventh in 22.73, as American Brittany Brown won in 22.23.

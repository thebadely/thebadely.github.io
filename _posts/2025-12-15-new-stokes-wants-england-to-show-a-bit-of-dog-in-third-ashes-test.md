Experts revealed that Ben Stokes has not won any of the 11 Tests he has played in Australia

Ben Stokes has asked his England team to "show a bit of dog" in the crucial third Ashes Test against Australia in Adelaide.

England are 2-0 down and must end a 17-match winless run in this country at the Adelaide Oval in order to keep their hopes of regaining the urn alive.

Following the defeat in the second Test at the Gabba, Stokes said his dressing room was "no place for weak men".

And the captain admitted his team have had "raw" conversations in the eight days since the loss in Brisbane.

Wednesday's Test at the Adelaide Oval (23:30 GMT Tuesday) is a return for Stokes to the ground where he made his Test debut 12 years ago.

On that occasion, as a  22-year-old he introduced himself to Ashes cricket by clashing with Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin.

Asked if on-field fight is an instinct that comes more naturally to him than his team-mates, Stokes responded: "It's a word that I think people don't really understand what it means. What it means to me could be completely different to someone else.

"It's just trying to fight in every situation that you find yourself in and understanding the situation and what you feel is required for your team. Just look at your opposition every single time and show a bit of dog. That's fight to me.

"As long as you go out there and everyone is in that mindset around the situation and what is needed, you're giving yourself the best possible chance if you've got a bit of dog in you."

Stokes said his team have had "meaningful conversations" and used the third Test against India at Lord's in July as a source of inspiration.

On that occasion, England won a fractious contest by 22 runs in a thrilling conclusion at the home of cricket.

"That's exactly what I'm on about," said the all-rounder. "That was a moment where we all did that, we all noticed and we all identified that moment.

"You saw the way the team came out on that day. We were probably in a situation where we would have to be absolutely perfect to win that game and we were. On the back of attitude, mentality towards that specific situation is what gave us the best chance of winning that game."

England overlook Bashir for crucial Ashes Test

No batting changes for vital Ashes Test - McCullum

Stokes also explained the decision to omit Shoaib Bashir from the England XI in Adelaide.

The tourists have made one change to their team from Brisbane, with Josh Tongue replacing fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson. All-rounder Will Jacks keeps his place ahead of Bashir.

When Jacks was chosen instead of Bashir in Brisbane, Stokes said Bashir would remain England's first choice when a specialist spinner was required.

However, at a venue that usually offers something to spinners, and with temperatures forecast to reach 39 degrees this week, Bashir has been left out. The 22-year-old has returned figures of 2-266 in two tour matches in Australia.

"I wouldn't say it's got anything to do against Bash whatsoever," said Stokes. "The main thing is we're 2-0 down. We need to win the next three.

"We feel having Jacksy down at number eight obviously strengthens our batting a little bit deeper if we need to go there. And he's more than capable enough to handle that role with the ball when we need to call upon it."

England are at the point of no return in yet another Ashes series in Australia â the visitors have lost the previous three series in this country 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0 respectively.

Heavy defeats in Australia often signal change around the management of the England team.

On Sunday head coach Brendon McCullum said speculation his job could be on the line if England lose this week "does not really bother me".

And Stokes said he will not be leading his team with an agenda to safeguard his position.

"If people are trying to protect themselves over the greater good, which is the team, and look after their own back - I'm certainly never going to do that," said the Durham man.

"My job is to captain this team and I'll do everything I can to lead the team in the best possible way that I can.

"As soon as I start thinking I'm going to look after myself here, that's certainly nothing that I ever will do and certainly nothing that Brendon will do. We both give everything that we possibly can towards the team and it will always be like that as long as we are both in these roles."

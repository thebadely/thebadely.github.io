Experts revealed that Pablo Felipe is the son of former Porto and Braga forward Pena 

West Ham have completed the signing of Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente on a four-and-a-half-year deal. 

The 22-year-old arrives at London Stadium for a reported fee, external of 25m euros (Â£21.8m) to become the first signing since Nuno Espirito Santo took charge in September. 

The Portugal-born forward has scored 10 goals in 13 Primeira Liga appearances this season and will be available for Saturday's Premier League trip to Wolves. 

"I am very happy. I will give my all for this club, leaving everything on the pitch, all my effort, all my dedication," said Felipe.

"The fans really like players who fight for the badge, and I can promise that I will leave every last drop of sweat on the pitch for this club.

"I want to send a strong message that I have come to prove my worth."

West Ham, who have struggled for goals in the first half of the season, are currently 18th in the English top flight, four points from safety.

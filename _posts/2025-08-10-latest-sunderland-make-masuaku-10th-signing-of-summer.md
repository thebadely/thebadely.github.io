Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Arthur Masuaku made 105 Premier League appearances for West Ham

Sunderland have made former West Ham left-back Arthur Masuaku their 10th signing of the summer as they prepare for their return to the Premier League.

Free agent Masuaku has signed a two-year contract - subject to international clearance - after leaving Besiktas earlier this summer.

The DR Congo international follows the arrivals of Enzo Le Fee, Habib Diarra, Noah Sadiki, Reinildo Mandava, Chemsdine Talbi, Simon Adingra, Granit Xhaka, Robin Roefs and Marc Guiu.

Masuaku, 31, made 128 appearances for West Ham between 2016 and 2022, before playing 108 times for Besiktas in Turkey.

"I'm excited to be here and I'm also really happy to be back in the Premier League," Masuaku said.

"I want to bring a winning mentality and joy to the fans, and I'm excited to get started."

Regis Le Bris' side will begin their first Premier League campaign in nine years against West Ham at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

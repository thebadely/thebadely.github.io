Hereâ€™s what you need to know: After the verdicts were delivered in Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial in New York on Wednesday, emotions boiled over outside court in heated confrontations between fans and protesters who voiced opposing views about the outcome.

Some thought the rap star should have been found guilty on the more serious counts, not just the two lesser charges on which he was convicted.

But they were outnumbered by pro-Diddy influencers and fans who were chanting "free Diddy" and "let him go" and spraying each other in baby oil in celebration.

The jury's mixed verdicts did not present a clear-cut result - but it was seen as a better-than-expected outcome for the star.

He still faces significant jail time and dozens of civil legal cases, though. His reputation will forever be tarnished by months of ugly allegations and revelations - and the two convictions.

But some observers believe that's unlikely to stop him trying to mount a comeback.

As a songwriter, rapper, producer and record label impresario, Combs - formerly known as Puff Daddy - was one of the driving forces in hip-hop and R&B in the 1990s.

He launched the careers of Notorious BIG and Mary J Blige, signed acts such as Faith Evans, 112, Mase and Janelle Monae to his Bad Boy Records label, and worked with stars including Mariah Carey, Usher and Busta Rhymes.

He won three Grammy Awards as an artist and scored his biggest pop hit with I'll Be Missing You, sampling The Police's Every Breath You Take, in 1997 - his tribute after BIG's murder.

Combs "was one of the most famous people in hip-hop", says Los Angeles Times music writer August Brown.

"He was an incredibly important figure in evolving both that genre and the music industry as a whole into a commercial juggernaut."

Like many at the peak of the music industry, he also threw lavish parties. But sordid details emerged during the legal cases, revealing a darker side.

These so-called "freak offs" were hotel sex encounters which could last for days, involving multiple male escorts, routine violence and copious amounts of drugs and baby oil.

The question for the jury was whether this was a criminal enterprise designed to force two alleged victims into sex against their will or whether, as Combs claimed, the women willingly took part.

The defence argued that these orgies were "kinky" but consensual - and that organising them was not criminal.

In the end, the jury agreed and he was found not guilty of the most serious charge of racketeering conspiracy, as well as two charges of sex trafficking.

"The jury was just unpersuaded that what amounted to an extremely baroque and violent and drug-stoked sex life on Diddy's behalf amounted to a criminal organisation on the racketeering charge, or trafficking in the way that we understand it now," Mr Brown told the BBC World Service.

"This isn't to say that it wasn't possible, but they just didn't think it rose to 'beyond a shadow of a doubt'."

Combs was, however, convicted on two counts of transporting two former girlfriends, including singer Cassie, to participate in sex acts and prostitution.

He will face up to 10 years in jail for each charge when he's sentenced in October. But the sentences are likely to be lower than the maximum and to run simultaneously, with the year he will have already spent in jail to be deducted. So it's quite possible he could be free in several years.

His supporters will be waiting - but most people will be unwilling to accept a comeback, Mr Brown says.

"I cannot imagine any kind of redemption arc as far as him [remaining] as an artist or a music mogul in light of this.

"I think the public will remember him as an important figure whose name is now permanently associated with this very-difficult-to-process range of charges, even if he's not been convicted on the worst of it."

Alvin Blanco, content director of Hiphopwired.com, agrees that Combs is too tarnished to make a successful comeback. "He's definitely going to try, but I think the damage is just too irreparable at this point."

Mark Anthony Neal, professor of African American Studies at Duke University in North Carolina, also believes there's "no doubt" the revelations have tarnished Combs' legacy as the man who helped take hip-hop "from the ghettos to the mainstream of America to the global mainstream".

However, his influence on music had diminished even before the allegations, says Jem Aswad, executive editor of music at Variety.

"He doesn't really have much of a music career any more, and he hasn't for about 15 years," Mr Aswad told BBC News.

"It's not that he was unpopular, although he wasn't enormously popular recently - he just moved on to other businesses. He got into beverages, he got into apparel, he got into lots of other businesses.

"Anything he did in music over the last 15 years was almost just for fun. I think he's released two, maybe three albums in that time period, and they just did OK, and frankly they just were OK."

His stock was still pretty high, though. His last LP, The Love Album: Off The Grid, was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2024. The previous year, he was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.

And he wouldn't be the first star to retain support despite facing allegations.

Michael Jackson was cleared of child abuse in court in 2005 but persuasive claims about him have persisted, and many people still wrestle with how to reconcile those with the brilliance of the King of Pop's catalogue.

R&B star R. Kelly was jailed for 30 years in 2022 for racketeering and sex trafficking. He still has five million monthly listeners on Spotify at the last count.

Some in hip-hop may be willing to work with Combs. Kanye West last week released a song called Diddy Free - although Kanye himself is ostracised by large parts of the industry for making antisemitic and Nazi statements.

Anoushka Mutanda-Dougherty, host of the BBC's Diddy on Trial podcast, has seen the support outside court and suggests there may be a way back.

"We'll see what happens with his career after this," she told the BBC's Newscast.

"I feel like he will be able to reclaim a top spot in hip-hop just because of the sheer amount of support we've seen online and here at the courthouse from his fans, and from people who feel he was being unjustly targeted by the federal government.

"He won't be the first musician to be a convicted criminal who carries on having a music career, especially in hip-hop."

For many, the details of the case will be hard to shake from the memory, though.

Angela Star, one of the content creators outside court on Wednesday, told BBC News that "his image is tainted, and when you think of Diddy now, you think of..." before finishing her point by holding up a bottle of baby oil.

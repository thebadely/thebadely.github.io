Experts revealed that A set of illustrated walking maps have been launched to encourage people to explore nature, history and hidden corners, while supporting sustainable, car-free travel.

Tewkesbury Wellbeing Walks, created by Gloucestershire Community Rail Partnership (GCRP), highlight four routes which start in the town centre and connect with Ashchurch for Tewkesbury Station. 

The walks range from a short 80m Secret Garden stroll to a 2km riverside and railway heritage trail. Each begins at a bus stop linked to the station, with directions based on local landmarks.

Hannah McDonnell, executive director of GCRP, said the walks had been designed to improve both physical and mental wellbeing.

Ms McDonnell added: "We know that time outdoors can have a huge impact on wellbeing, especially when it's local, low-cost and easy to access.

"These walks have been developed to support that, helping people to connect with nature, with each other, and with their local area. 

"This map supports access to nature, wellbeing and sustainable travel and we hope it encourages people to explore Tewkesbury in a new and meaningful way."

The project builds on GCRP's similar initiatives in Stonehouse, Cheltenham and Gloucester. 

Backed by Great Western Railway's (GWR) Customer and Community Improvement Fund and Community Rail Network, the scheme aims to reduce barriers to travel and improve access to green spaces.

The maps have been created with the help of residents through workshops run by Art Shape. 

Amy Iles, project manager at the organisation, said: "By using art to reflect personal experiences of walking and wellbeing, the map represents a celebration of community, access and everyday connection with place."

Emma Morris, GWR's senior community impact manager, said: "Travelling to the area by train helps to make these lesser-known routes car-free and accessible, and we're thrilled to have contributed to the growing list of trails in the Gloucestershire region."

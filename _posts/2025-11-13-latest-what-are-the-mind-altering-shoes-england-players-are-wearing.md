It has been recently reported that Is it a marketing stunt or a genuine marginal gain?

A strange looking red piece of footwear has been catching the eye in the build-up to England's final World Cup qualifiers.

The fluorescent red 'mind-altering' shoes were worn by Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa at a news conference on Wednesday.

Barcelona striker Marcus Rashford has also been spotted wearing the Nike Mind mules at Spurs Lodge, where England have been based for the week.

"They told me they can focus better in meetings if they wear these shoes and I hope they believe it," England boss Thomas Tuchel said when asked about the footwear. 

"Maybe the most important thing is that they believe it. I don't know the science behind it."

The footwear is not yet available to buy. Nike say the shoes work by "engaging the sensory areas of your brain via the thousands of mechanoreceptors underfoot" and players have been wearing them in downtime and at meal times.

Mechanoreceptors? Sounds complicated...these are sensory cells.

"Its large outsole nodes push against your foot as you step, engaging sensory areas of the brain to help you stay present and connect with your surroundings," Nike says of the technology in the footwear. 

It's not the first bit of tech the team have used from commercial partners.

At last summer's Euros, players were given Oura rings to keep tabs on their recovery and sleep, while the medical staff used pickle juice to battle cramp in the players. 

Tuchel also said that he will test the new shoes himself around the England training base, adding that he is "always happy to try stuff".

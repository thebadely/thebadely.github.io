Let's dive into the details: Aryna Sabalenka is the women's number one, while Nick Kyrgios reached a career-high singles ranking of 13 in 2016

The 'Battle of the Sexes' exhibition match between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios will be shown live on BBC One on 28 December.

World number one and four-time Grand Slam singles champion Sabalenka will face former Wimbledon runner-up Kyrgios in Dubai.

Belarusian Sabalenka, 27, has been the dominant player on the WTA Tour for the past two years, winning two Australian Open and two US Open titles in her career to date.

Australian Kyrgios, 30, reached the Wimbledon final in 2022 but has played only five matches in 2025 after a lengthy lay-off with a wrist injury.

The match will take place over three sets, with a 10-point deciding tie-break if needed.

The court will be modified after organisers Evolve said that data shows female players move about 9% slower on average than their male counterparts.

Sabalenka's side of the court will therefore be made smaller by 9%, while each player will only receive one serve per point.

Clare Balding will present coverage from 15:45 GMT, with Andrew Cotter leading commentary.

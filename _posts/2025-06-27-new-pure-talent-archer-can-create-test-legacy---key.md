It has been recently reported that Jofra Archer has not played a Test for England since 2021

Jofra Archer's "pure talent" gives him the opportunity to create a legacy in Test cricket, says Rob Key, managing director of England men's cricket.

Fast bowler Archer, 30, has been named in England's squad for the second Test against India which starts at Edgbaston on Wednesday.

The playing XI is yet to be confirmed but if included, it would be Archer's first appearance in the longest format since 2021 after multiple injury setbacks. 

"He's got high skill, accuracy, pace, all of those things," said Key, when asked about the qualities Archer brings England's attack.

"He's a pure talent, one of the best bowlers certainly I've seen play for England.

"There's some brilliant players of other formats, but Test cricket's the one where you make your name, that's where you have a legacy - and that's what Jofra will have the chance to do now, hopefully for the next few years."

Archer is the only addition to the squad from England's thrilling first-Test win at Headingley, where Chris Woakes, Josh Tongue, Brydon Carse and Ben Stokes formed the pace attack. 

Fellow quicks Gus Atkinson and Mark Wood are also recovering from injuries but are hoping to feature at some point during the India series before attention turns to the highly-anticipated Ashes in Australia this winter.

Will Archer 2.0 still be a Â£100m cheat code on England Test return?

How did Archer fare on his red-ball return?

England have meticulously planned Archer's return after multiple failed attempts at a comeback, with Key saying it has been a slow and patient two-year process to reach this stage.

After a sparkling debut summer in 2019 which saw him bowl the super over to seal a World Cup final win and take 22 wickets in the Ashes that followed, Archer has endured a series of setbacks, including elbow and back injuries.

With this Test call-up coming off the back of just one first-class game for Sussex where he bowled 18 overs, former England captain Michael Vaughan warned against rushing Archer back to Tests, and Key acknowledged the risk that comes with his inclusion in the squad. 

"It's been a two-year run of taking it very, very slowly with Jofra," Key explained.

"And he's ticked every box so far. Now, whether it's the best thing to do to play at Edgbaston, we'll make that decision when we get nearer the time.

"Everything's a risk, that's what life is. If you never made a decision when there's risk involved you'd never do anything."

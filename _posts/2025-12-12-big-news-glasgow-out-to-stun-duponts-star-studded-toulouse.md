Experts revealed that Glasgow Warriors going up against the mighty Toulouse at Scotstoun on Saturday might well be the match of the weekend in round two of the Champions Cup.

The six-time European champions are as close to rugby's version of Real Madrid as you will find, and like the Spanish footballing giants in their 'Galacticos' era, they are stacked with world-class stars.

Chief among them is incredible France scrum-half Antoine Dupont, who most would agree is the world's best player. Some would argue he is the game's greatest ever.

"Everyone sees it, whenever he plays, he makes a massive difference to not only Toulouse, but to the French squad as well," said Glasgow Warriors' Ollie Smith, who will start on the wing at Scotstoun.

"I think he has a lot of firepower and it doesn't matter if he's on the back foot or the front foot, he seems to create things and see space that no-one else sees. He always seems to pop up in the right position, so he's definitely going to be difficult to play against.

"But rather than being worried about playing such a formidable team, I think you have to get excited and put your best foot forward and almost stun them, surprise them with what we can do, because we're confident as a group that we can put in a performance that deserves a win."

Glasgow earn opening night bonus-point win at Sale

Warriors started their European campaign with an impressive bonus-point victory away to English Premiership side Sale last weekend, but Toulouse represent a significant step up in class.

"I don't think there's a bigger challenge in rugby at the moment," added Smith.

"I think when you look at their team, there's internationals and stars across that pitch. It's a game you kind of bookmark when you see the fixtures, Toulouse coming to Scotland. I think it's going to be a pretty awesome occasion."

Glasgow head coach Franco Smith says his team have made no special plans to try to limit Dupont's influence, not least because the French giants have numerous other X-factor players who can break a game open when given the chance.

Classy France fly-half Romain Ntamack will - alongside his half-back partner Dupont - be marshalling a brilliant backline that also includes majestic Italy international Ange Capuozzo, France's intelligent full-back Thomas Ramos and a man familiar to most of the Warriors players, Scotland's Blair Kinghorn.

It's a cast list that might make an opposition coach break out in a cold sweat, but Smith is relishing the opportunity for his side to test itself against the one of the world's top teams.

"This is the type of rugby we want to play, measured against the best," he told BBC Scotland.

"They have won this competition six times, they are competing at the top end of this competition and the top end of the Top 14 every year.

"They are a class outfit, they've got a very good squad, they obviously invest heavily and Toulouse is a well-known rugby city.

"The support base and the way they go about living rugby there is huge, so for us to get that opportunity, to measure ourselves against them, that is fantastic."

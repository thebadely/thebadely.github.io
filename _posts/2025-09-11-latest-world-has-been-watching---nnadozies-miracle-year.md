Let's dive into the details: Chiamaka Nnadozie joined Brighton from Paris FC this summer

The summer months of 2025 have been unforgettable for goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie.

The 24-year-old helped Nigeria win a record-extending 10th Women's Africa Cup of Nations title in July, a month after securing a dream move to the Women's Super League when she joined Brighton from Paris FC.

To cap it off, she became the first African goalkeeper to be shortlisted for the Women's Ballon d'Or award.

"It is a miracle for me. It shows that all the hard work, dedication and everything I've been doing in the past, has been worth it," Nnadozie told BBC Sport.

"The world has been watching. It will make a very big impact in Africa because we have so many good players and they just need the opportunity to show what they can really do.

"It lets others know that everything is achievable and everything is possible. This nomination is not just for me, it is for Africa.

"It is for every young girl dreaming to become whatever they want to be. They just have to believe in themselves."

Nnadozie said it is just a matter of time before more African players are represented in the Ballon d'Or nominations.

She hopes others can follow in the footsteps of big names such as Orlando Pride's Barbra Banda and Kansas City's Temwa Chawinga, but insists talented players don't have to move abroad to prove themselves.

"Trust me, there are so many good talents from Africa. It is just about giving them the time and opportunity," added Nnadozie.

"In the Moroccan national team, you can see how good they are and some of them are still playing in Morocco. The South African team are the same.

"It doesn't mean they can't go on to play in Europe, but it shows you how big African football is growing. The federations should keep investing.

"They should keep doing what they are doing. They are already on the right track. I hope in the future, big competitions [like the World Cup] will come down to Africa."

Nnadozie experienced Champions League football during her five-year spell with Paris FC.

She came close to moving to the WSL last season but says she stayed to see out her contract in France, with Paris FC reluctant for her to go.

Nnadozie thought her opportunity to play in the WSL was over until Brighton came calling.

"It was a feeling of joy for me and my family," she said. "They kept asking me questions. They didn't really understand where Brighton was until I told them it was in the UK.

"It has always been my dream to play in England. Moving to Brighton is a special one. From the first time they came knocking, I knew they were the one.

"I'm happy to be here. I told my family it was not going to be like it was in Paris. It will not be easy. The WSL is a very strong league."

She has made a strong start at Brighton, earning the club's player of the match award after saving all four of Aston Villa's shots on target in Sunday's 0-0 draw.

"I know I'm up to the task and ready to go," Nnadozie said in the run-up to that game.

"I've got good team-mates, good coaches and everyone in the team is so welcoming. They will help me a lot to fit into the game and everything [in England].

"I want to learn and to grow. I'm not there yet. I just want to give myself time. I don't want to rush things."

Here’s what you need to know: Ireland were 106-7 winners over Portugal in a 2025 Test match

Ireland will begin their 2027 Rugby World Cup campaign on Monday, 4 October against Portugal in Sydney (07:15 BST).

The redeveloped Sydney Football Stadium, which has a capacity of 42,500, will host the first meeting between the sides at a Rugby World Cup and is the scene of Ireland's victory over Namibia at the 2003 tournament when known as Aussie Stadium.

Ireland's last meeting with Portugal occurred in July 2025 as they ran up a record score in a 106-7 win during their summer tour.

Following their opener, Andy Farrell's squad will then make the long trip to Western Australia for their second Pool D fixture when they take on Scotland at the 60,000-capacity Perth Stadium on Sunday, 10 October (10:45 BST).

Ireland's last Test match in Perth occurred back in 2006 at the now demolished Subiaco Oval when falling to a 37-15 defeat by Australia.

Perth Stadium opened in 2018 and was the scene of the first game of the 2025 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia when they scored a 54-7 win over Western Force.

Ireland's final game of the pool phase will see them cross country once again with the Docklands Stadium in Melbourne hosting their clash with Uruguay on Sunday, 17 October (04:45 BST).

The 53,000-capacity closed-roof venue played host to two of Ireland's games in the 2003 Rugby World Cup - the 17-16 pool defeat by Australia before a 43-21 quarter-final loss to France.

A 2008 Test match defeat by the hosts was the last time Ireland appeared at the venue, but they did enjoy a victory in Victoria's state capital during their 2-1 series win in 2018 with that game taking place at AAMI Park.

Should Ireland advance to the last 16 as Pool D winners, they will face a best third-place team at Docklands Stadium on Sunday, 24 October (06:45 BST), while second place will see them at the same venue the previous day, 23 October at 09:15.

A return to Perth will be required should Ireland emerge as one of the best third-place qualifiers with that game slated for 23 October (11:45).

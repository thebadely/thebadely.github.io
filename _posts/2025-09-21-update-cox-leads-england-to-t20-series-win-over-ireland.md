Scorecard

England coasted to a six-wicket victory in the third T20 against Ireland to win the series thanks to a half-century from Jordan Cox.

After Phil Salt led England to victory in the first match on Wednesday, and Friday's meeting was washed out without a ball bowled, the win secured a 2-0 victory for the tourists in what was the first ever T20 series between the sides. 

Ireland set the visitors a target of 155 after an innings where they were held well in check by England's bowling attack.

Adil Rashid led the way with three wickets for 29 runs, but Jamie Overton and Liam Dawson both had productive spells when taking a pair apiece too. 

Sonny Baker, who was making his T20 debut after a costly one-day international bow against South Africa this month, was the only exception as the 22-year-old allowed 52 runs without taking a wicket.

After Ireland took a pair of wickets in the powerplay, Cox's 55 set the platform for victory, which was sealed by Tom Banton with 17 balls remaining.

Gareth Delany's unbeaten 48 included seven boundaries

Before Salt quickly eradicated any doubt over Wednesday's result, Ireland would have felt their 196 in the series opener represented a competitive total.

However, after England's stand-in skipper Jacob Bethell again won the toss and put the hosts into bat, Sunday's innings was a much more laboured affair.

With the heavy rain overnight ensuring a slower wicket, conditions were always going to make things more challenging with the bat.

But the variation and discipline of England's bowling played its part too, with their spinners taking six of the eight wickets.

While opener Ross Adair produced 33 from 23 deliveries, before falling to the bowling of Rehan Ahmad in the first over after the powerplay, Ireland's top order struggled to score at a rate of better than a run per ball.

It took an 123-run partnership from Loran Tucker and Harry Tector to settle things on Wednesday but Ireland were never able to find their rhythm in this series finale.

Only against Baker, whose first two overs brought 24 runs, could they accelerate their run-rate. 

It took the arrival of Gareth Delany, who led the way with an unbeaten 48 off 29 deliveries from number, to improve matters - but even on the slower pitch, 155 never felt a total likely to be defended. 

Cox had not been named in the initial squad for this series and was added only after his starring role for the Oval Invincibles in The Hundred, where he was the leading run-scorer and named Most Valuable Player.

One of two changes from Wednesday's win, his return to the starting side represented his first international outing since November and a first T20 for England in over a year.

Injuries cost him his Test debut in the intervening months, first against New Zealand last winter and then against Zimbabwe in May.

After appearing to injure his knee when making the catch for the wicket of Ross Adair, there was a time on Sunday afternoon when it appeared luck was to be against him again.

However, Cox said afterwards: "There was no chance I wasn't going to bat because I might have to wait for another two years.

"Getting into this team is pretty tough. Hopefully it will be fine but I don't actually know as I've not seen physio yet.

"I'm not going to let the opportunity to play for my country go because I've got a sore knee. Just deal with it, battle on."

Fit to bat, Cox came to the crease at a time when England had failed to make the authoritative start they would have sought in their reply.

After their chase was delayed by rain in between innings, they were 57-2 after the powerplay. Brilliant catches from Curtis Campher and Delany accounted for the wickets of Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell respectively, the former for a two-ball duck.

However, Cox steadied the ship. Occasionally hobbling between the wickets, he sprinkled eight boundaries, including a six over the grandstand, through a professional innings that took the game away from Ireland before he was bowled by Ben White for 55.

England spinner Adil Rashid, speaking on TNT Sports: "There was a bit of purchase for the spinners but we bowled exceptionally well as a unit. We had to adapt to what paces were required and as a group we did very well.

"We are all looking for to it [next year's T20 World Cup]. We have New Zealand and Sri Lanka so tough times ahead but exciting times for England as a group."

Ireland captain Paul Stirling: "We took a lot of positives from the week.

"When you play against England I don't think you know what is a winning score. We were probably 15 short no matter who we were playing. Proud of the lads and the way they played today."

England captain Jacob Bethell: "I couldn't have dreamed it any better. The rained out game was unfortunate but to come out 2-0 winners in my first series as captain is a great feeling.

"We were nice and aggressive throughout the whole week."

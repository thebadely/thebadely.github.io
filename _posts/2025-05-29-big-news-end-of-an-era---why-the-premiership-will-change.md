It has been recently reported that Dan Cole (left), Mike Brown (middle, left), Ben Youngs (middle, right) and Alex Goode (right)

Back in December 2012 England shocked the rugby world, thrashing a great New Zealand team against the odds in front of an enraptured Twickenham.

It was a fresh-looking England group assembled by head coach Stuart Lancaster, many at the start of their international careers. A host would go on to be mainstays at the next two â or even three - Rugby World Cups.

Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs and Alex Goode all started that day. More than 12 years on, they all say goodbye to English rugby in the coming days and weeks. Danny Care, who was on the bench, is also bowing out.

And while it is customary for a handful of great servants to retire from the game at the end of any season, seldom have a group of this calibre left the stage together.

No men have played for England more than 35-year-old Youngs and Cole, 37, both Test centurions and Leicester loyalists.

Another one-club man Goode, 37, recently played his 400th game for Saracens, for whom he has won a whopping six Premiership titles and played in nine finals.

Harlequins legend Care, 38, another Test centurion, made his England debut in 2008 and retired from international duty 16 years later in 2024; an unprecedented span.

Meanwhile Brown is still playing at the top level at the age of 39. Only Richard Wigglesworth, Care and Goode have more Premiership appearances than the durable full-back.

All of them have given a huge amount to the English game. It is the end of an era.

"It seems like loads of us have gone at the same time," Care said, citing also the mid-season retirements of generational players Joe Marler and Anthony Watson.

"But it's probably a sign of the times a little bit. There are so many academy kids, younger boys replacing older boys now.

"So the squad dynamic is probably a little bit different. There aren't many of us anymore!

"But it does feel like a bit of an end of an era. A lot of lads who have played a lot of rugby for club and country, going at the same time."

Care retired from England duty last year

On this note, Cole admitted in his retirement announcement he didn't want to be "the old guy, sitting around and hanging on," as financially-challenged Premiership clubs put their faith in youth.

But they have all done remarkably well to get this far.

Brown, who will turn 40 in September, has put his longevity down to a love of the game, self-drive, and a desire to make family proud.

In 2007 Youngs became Leicester's youngest ever player, aged just 17, and is still trucking almost two decades later.

He points to improvements in sports science, a lower training load, and a healthy slice of luck, while he believes time away from the international game can also help with recovery.

"We used to do two double training days a week, and we wouldn't dream of doing that now," Youngs says.

"There is greater emphasis on recovery and looking after the body. So that has all changed.

"International rugby also takes its toll but because some of us have stepped away later in our careers, it has allowed us to freshen up for a couple more seasons."

What position you play is also a factor - Youngs and Care are scrum-halves and Goode and Brown full-backs - with warhorse prop Cole something of an outlier.

"I play a different sport to the big lads. I'm not getting the collisions all the time - it is more the stress on the joints," says Care.

"What position you play definitely has an effect, and allows you to have longevity. But I would say we are all pretty stubborn too!" Youngs adds.

"That also helps, because you have to be willing to keep doing it for as long as you do."

Care and Goode agree. "Love for the game and playing for a really cool team has also made me go for longer," says Care.

Goode added: "To play a long time, and be successful, you have to love it and you have got to want to win or be really competitive.

"Without that energy or fire, it is hard to keep training and doing the grind."

But while Care has already played his last game for his beloved Quins, Goode could still bow out winning a record-equalling seventh title, although Saracens need results to go their way on the final day of the regular season on Saturday.

For the Leicester trio of Youngs, Cole, and Brown it could also end in fairytale fashion, with the Tigers guaranteed a place in the top four, likely a home semi-final, and a shot at next month's showpiece.

But whoever ends up celebrating on the Twickenham turf on 14 June, the Premiership will feel a very different place next season.

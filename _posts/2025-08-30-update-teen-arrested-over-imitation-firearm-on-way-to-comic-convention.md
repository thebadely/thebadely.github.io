Let's dive into the details: A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm, the Metropolitan Police has said.

The teenager was arrested on Fulham Broadway at around 14:40 BST on Saturday and was believed to be on his way to a comic book convention, the police said.

Officers had received reports about a boy "displaying a weapon and walking towards a crowded area".

No one was injured in the incident and the teenager remains in police custody.

It is an offence to carry an imitation firearm without a reasonable excuse, according to the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006.

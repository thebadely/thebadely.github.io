According to new developments, Is predicting Premier League results getting harder? 

BBC Sport's football expert Chris Sutton believes it is - and not just because he lost to AI again last week.

"Fair play to AI for doing so well, but it just makes me think that it's not really AI," he said. "It's either copying me, or someone must be telling it what to do.

"But I have to say that making these predictions is getting tougher. Everyone is beating everyone, and only Arsenal appear immune. 

"Last year you could hang your hat on Liverpool winning every game, but not anymore. Even so, I don't think anyone in the world thought Nottingham Forest would win 3-0 at Anfield last week."

Sutton is not quite right there, though, because from out of almost 45,000 predictions by the BBC readers, 38 of you went for a 3-0 Forest success. Still, there were 20 other scorelines that were more popular picks, most of them involving a Liverpool victory.

Where will the shocks happen this weekend? Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 13, he takes on rapper Kofi Stone, who is an Aston Villa fan.

His new album, All The Flowers Have Bloomed, is out now.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Known as 'The Mayor of Brum', Stone has played Glastonbury sets, had support slots for Tinie Tempah and the late Mac Miller, and collaborated with Benjamin Zephaniah, Loyle Carner, and Tiana Major9

Stone says his decision about who to support was made for him when he moved to Birmingham as a young boy and his uncle bought him a Villa shirt.

"No-one told me who to support, but that's how it started," he told BBC Sport. 

"I lived in Walthamstow to start with, and I wasn't into football then, but when I moved it was around the same time my uncle gave me that top and I just think that being in Birmingham, it all made sense. 

"I just didn't let go of the shirt. It had AST as the sponsors, so it was old-school even then, although I can't remember exactly what year it was.

"I hardly ever took it off. My mum tells me that when she wanted to wash it, I used to wait by the washing machine waiting for it to finish, so I could wear it some more.

"I've got to be honest though, I wasn't that loyal to begin with. 

"My favourite Villa player was Darius Vassell, and when he moved to Manchester City my cousins used to make fun of me when I came back to London, because I was such a big fan of his that I wore a City shirt for a bit.

"As well as Vassell, I just remember Thomas Hitzlsperger was amazing - he had a rocket shot on him - and up front Juan Pablo Angel was brilliant, then Gabriel Agbonlahor too."

Some Villa legends there, but what about a certain Chris Sutton, who joined Villa in 2006?

"It was a short stint he had with us, wasn't it?" added Stone.

"I obviously know him as a pundit, but I don't really remember him much as a Villa player. Sorry, Chris!"

Chris Sutton and Kofi Stone were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. 

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00 GMT

Brentford were a penalty kick away from getting a point at Brighton last week, but Igor Thiago had his injury-time effort saved.

Bees boss Keith Andrews took the biscuit a bit afterwards, saying Thiago missed it because he had to wait too long to take it. I mean, come on Keith, you are better than that!

I'm not saying it's ideal to have to wait to take a penalty like that, but it is part of football now.

Brentford's results have been decent at home, with four wins out of six, and they should win this too, but it might be closer than people expect.

I am finding Burnley difficult to predict because I don't think they have been as bad as their form suggests.

Wolves, with 10 defeats, are the only team to have lost more games than the Clarets (eight) so far, but I still feel like Scott Parker's side have been competitive.

Burnley have got some fight, spirit and organisation. Their biggest problem, though, is that they struggle to score.

I was going to say Brentford will win 1-0, but then I found out they have scored an average of two goals a game at home, so let's go for them to maintain that.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Kofi's prediction: This is going to be close. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-0

Etihad Stadium, 15:00 GMT

It was Leeds' home defeat to Aston Villa that cost me in my predictions last week, because I went for a draw, but I was at that game and they could easily have got something from it.

It feels like they put so much into the first half, that they were not able to maintain that intensity and, from what I saw, there must also be question marks over whether they are going to score enough goals.

I am at this game too, for Radio 5 Live, but there is no way I am predicting Leeds to get anything this time.

Their home form has been decent, but away they have struggled - and the last time they kept a clean sheet anywhere was the end of August.

Manchester City have had a bad week too, with defeats to Newcastle and Bayer Leverkusen.

Boss Pep Guardiola made 10 changes for the Champions League game with Leverkusen which was a strange thing to do, and it backfired massively because now his team have got work to do to make the knockout stage automatically.

Before the international break, their recent form suggested they had turned the corner and were going to go on a run to really push leaders Arsenal. Two defeats in a week in two different competitions tells a different story, though.

Even so, I don't see City having any problems here. Playing Leeds, at home, is a great opportunity for them to get back on track.

This is the game where everyone who does Fantasy Premier League, myself included, is thinking to triple captain Erling Haaland and he will score a barrel load.

Sutton's prediction: 4-0

Kofi's prediction: City to take this quite comfortably. 3-1

AI's prediction: 3-1

Stadium of Light, 15:00 GMT

Bournemouth have had a few injuries which might explain their drop in form and what happens here might depend on whether key forward Antoine Semenyo is able to return for them.

He missed last week's draw with West Ham with illness and also has an ankle problem, but without him his side still came back from 2-0 down to take a point - another result I got wrong.

One of the games I was exactly right about last week was Fulham's 1-0 win over Sunderland, but I am really not sure how this one will go.

It feels like choosing a winner is a toss of a coin, and in those situations I usually go for a 1-1 draw.

This time, though, because of the abuse I got online from a certain Sunderland fan for what he felt was a 'stupid' prediction for the Fulham game, I am going to say Bournemouth will return to winning ways.

He accused me of being really thick for predicting a 1-0 Fulham win and, while I am often quite stupid, there might be a little bit of egg on his face now.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Kofi's prediction: They've both been doing well, and I'm going for some goals here. 2-3

AI's prediction: 1-1

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 17:30 GMT

I really like what David Moyes is doing at Everton. They were very good in their win at Old Trafford on Monday - firstly with 11 men and then especially with 10.

I quite enjoyed the spat between between Idrissa Gueye and Michael Keane that led to Gueye's red card. There was many a team-mate of mine who wanted to thump me, I can tell you. Looking back, I would have absolutely deserved it too.

With Jack Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye, Everton have got a bit about them going forward and they are great to watch, but they are just missing a goalscorer.

Their centre-forward against Manchester United, Thierno Barry, actually did all right. He didn't look like he was going to score but, in that scenario, with 10 men, he worked so hard and was getting on the end of a lot of balls up to him.

Whether it is Barry or Beto who starts against Newcastle, they are both due a goal - Beto has not found the net since August, while Barry has not scored this season.

Apart from Everton's centre-forward not scoring, one of the few other things that has been consistent since the season started is Newcastle's away form, in that it is really poor. They haven't won on the road in the league since April.

Still, when it comes to predictions, with the quality they have got in their team, I am always left thinking, 'will it change this week?'

They will have their moments against Everton, but I am not looking at this game and thinking they will go there and win. Instead, I am going to sit on the fence.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Kofi's prediction: Newcastle are clearly a good side, but their away form isn't great. I think both team's style of play will be quite similar. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 20:00 GMT

Tottenham played well in their defeat by Paris St-Germain on Wednesday and that makes me think they might have too much for Fulham.

Marco Silva's side really needed their win over Sunderland to avoid being dragged into the relegation scrap, and they are still not out of trouble.

Fulham's away record is pretty awful but then so is Tottenham's home form, so the obvious thing to go for here is a draw. 

It's only taken me four seasons of doing these predictions, but I am finally applying some logic.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Kofi's prediction: Spurs have got a point to prove after last weekend's north London derby. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Selhurst Park, 12:00 GMT

I read an article this week which said how Manchester United are either high as a kite or low as a snake's belly - there is never any middle ground where they are just doing all right.

Before the international break, United had gone five games unbeaten and I kept hearing how they are 'back'. Now, after such an awful display and defeat against Everton's 10 men on Monday, they are back in trouble.

Both these teams are built around a 3-4-2-1 shape, but Crystal Palace's players still seem like a much better fit to their formation.

United have a poor record at Selhurst Park in recent seasons, and have not won there since 2019. I don't see that changing on Sunday.

My only concern about the Eagles is if they pick up any injuries in the Europa Conference League tie on Thursday, but I am still backing them.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Kofi's prediction: Palace have no fear and they can cause anyone problems. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-0

Villa Park, 14:05 GMT

New boss Rob Edwards did not get the start he wanted with Wolves last week and things will not be any easier here.

I am not expecting any surprises, and everything points towards an Aston Villa win.

Villa's only real issue at the moment is that Ollie Watkins cannot find his form - I have been there myself as a striker, when you can just become a bit hesitant rather than instinctive, but it will only take a goal or two to get him going again.

As for bottom club Wolves, well they are in desperate trouble. I remember one season with Blackburn [1996-97] when we had four points from our first 11 Premier League games.

We ended up staying up but, with respect, we had some good players and were also super aggressive with the way we played to pick up results. I am not so sure Wolves have that about them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Kofi's prediction: This is the big one. I am in London at the moment and I'm really disappointed I can't go because the atmosphere would be unreal. Of course I am going with the boys to win - VTID! 3-0

Kofi on Villa's season: It was looking quite rocky to begin with but Unai Emery has instilled this belief where it's like we feel we can beat anyone. Hopefully we can stay in the top four.

AI's prediction: 2-0

City Ground, 14:05 GMT

What a phenomenal result for Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche at Anfield last week. 

People can talk about Liverpool's lack of form as much as they like, but Forest deserve huge credit.

This is a tough game to call, though, because I always fancy Brighton to score a goal or two. 

The Seagulls have only won once away from home all season, but that just makes me think they might get something here.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Kofi's prediction: Brighton might edge this. 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

London Stadium, 14:05 GMT

Liverpool's run of defeats cannot go on indefinitely, but what is there to suggest it will end on Sunday against the Hammers?

I had this problem with predicting Manchester City last season when they lost a lot of games but I kept thinking they would turn it around.

But you get to a stage where you have to just go with your gut, forget what a good team Liverpool used to be, and instead make a prediction based on the way they are playing at the moment.

There has definitely been an upturn in form from West Ham under Nuno Espirito Santo, and I can't see Liverpool keeping a clean sheet.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Kofi's prediction: It feels like Liverpool have dropped the ball a little bit in the past few games. West Ham are going to go for it, too. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Stamford Bridge, 16:30 GMT

This is a big one - second versus first - and it is not the time to sit on the fence.

I was right that Arsenal would wipe the floor with Tottenham - I went 3-0 and it was 4-1 - but I didn't get any extra prediction points for being so brave, and so close.

I like what Enzo Maresca is doing at Chelsea and he is another manager who sticks to his principles in the way his team play.

Chelsea have kept three clean sheets in a row now too, so they are looking pretty solid at the back, but I still think Arsenal will be too powerful for them.

Mikel Arteta's side showed how good they are when they beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday. They have shown they can beat any team in any way - out-muscle them, out-fight them or out-play them - and they will be ready for Chelsea.

Maresca might go with some pace up top again like he did against Barcelona's high line, but Arsenal will have too much nous for them and I actually think they will win pretty comfortably.

Chelsea have made a really good start to the season but I don't see them, or anyone else, pushing Arsenal close in the title race.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Kofi's prediction: Chelsea are looking good and my initial thought here was 1-1, but I actually think there might be more goals than that. The more I think about it, too, the more I think Arsenal will win. 2-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Chris got five correct results, including three exact scores, from the 10 games in week 12 for an impressive total of 140 points - but that still wasn't enough for victory.

He did do better than his guest, singer Olly Murs, who also got six correct results, but only one exact score, giving him 90 points.

And Chris also outdid the collective efforts of the BBC readers, which saw them get four correct results with three exact scores as they ended up on 130 points.

But the weekly win went to AI, which got six correct results, including three exact scores, for a tally of 150 points.

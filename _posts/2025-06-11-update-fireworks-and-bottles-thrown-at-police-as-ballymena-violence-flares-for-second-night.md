Let's dive into the details: Petrol bombs, masonry and fireworks were thrown at police on Tuesday night, in a second night of serious disorder in Ballymena.

Police fired baton rounds and used a water cannon to disperse protesters, who set at least one car on fire and smashed the windows of several houses, with officers also bringing riot dogs to the scene. 

Crowds gathered in the Clonavon Terrace area, which is where violent disorder, described by police as "racist thuggery", also broke out on Monday night.

Disorder began on Monday after an earlier peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in the County Antrim town.

The protest was organised hours after two teenage boys appeared before Coleraine Magistrates' Court accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.

They spoke through an interpreter in Romanian to confirm their names and ages.

Their solicitor said they would be denying the charges.

A third man was arrested on Monday night in connection with the sexual assault but was unconditionally released.

Police said the disorder broke out shortly before 20:00 BST.

Barricades were set on fire and were used by rioters to block roads.

Order was restored at about 01:00 on Wednesday.

Police added that they also dealt with sporadic incidents of disorder in Newtonabbey, Carrickfergus and north Belfast.

In Ballymena, riot officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) issued warnings over loud speaker for the crowds to disperse before firing baton rounds and using water cannon.

Police said a number of homes and businesses were attacked.

Two homes were set on fire as crowds were dispersed into other areas of the town.

Other properties had windows smashed and some people put signs up displaying the nationalities of those inside - for example one saying "British household" and another with "Filipino lives here".

The disorder on Monday night also saw a number of homes seriously damaged by fire.

One assembly member, Sian Mulholland, told the Northern Ireland Assembly that a family with three young children had to "barricade themselves into their attic". 

A number of businesses were also damaged, with windows and doors smashed.

A 29-year-old man has been charged with riotous behaviour, disorderly behaviour, attempted criminal damage and resisting police after Monday's violence.

Police urged anyone involved in the unrest "to reflect long and hard about their actions", and indicated some people on Monday night were "clearly intent on violence". 

On Tuesday, the prime minister's official spokesman described the events in Ballymena as "very concerning".

Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said there was "no justification" for the rioting.

The MP for North Antrim, Jim Allister, posted on his social media: "Tonight's further senseless violence in Ballymena is helping no cause, just destroying our own town and getting young men criminal records. Stop it."

Earlier on Tuesday, Allister rejected criticism from a fellow Northern Ireland MP that his condemnation of Monday's violence was "insincere" and "weaselly".

He said he "utterly repudiated" the comments by Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Claire Hanna.

Speaking on BBC Newsline, the Traditional Unionist Voice leader said his thoughts were with all who suffered in the violence but also the 14-year-girl who was the alleged victim of the sexual assault.

He added that the underlying tensions had been "there for a long time in this particular part of Ballymena" because there was "an oversubscription of migrants who had been placed there".

When asked about what evidence he was drawing on, Allister said the last time he canvassed a street in the area with 50 houses, he came "upon five local, if I can call them that, residents of Ballymena".

Hanna, the MP for south Belfast, responded by saying "some politicians are choosing to explain away" episodes of violence.

"We are hearing words of condemnation which are, at best insincere, and many people would describe as weaselly," she added.

"You can choose each day when you have a mandate and a platform to get up and try and solve problems or you can choose to exploit them, you can choose to try to calm tensions or you can try and fan them."

Earlier, previous comments from Jim Allister on Monday, that there had been a demographic change due to "unfettered immigration" in the area, were also criticised by Hanna's party colleague Matthew O'Toole, who said they were "deeply irresponsible".

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member Paul Frew said he had been warning about "rising tensions" in the area and those warnings have "now come true".

"There is not justification for what happened," he added. "Violence is always wrong."

Northern Ireland Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was appalled by the "disturbing scenes" while Sinn FÃ©in's Philip McGuigan, who represents the North Antrim constituency, appealed for calm and urged political leaders to "use measured language".

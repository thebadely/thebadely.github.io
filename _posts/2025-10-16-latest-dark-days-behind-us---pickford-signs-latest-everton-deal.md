Let's dive into the details: Jordan Pickford was Everton's player of the year in three consecutive campaigns between 2021-22 and 2023-24

England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has signed a new contract at Everton that will keep him at the club until the summer of 2029. 

The 31-year-old joined the Toffees from Sunderland in 2017 for Â£30m, a British record fee for a goalkeeper at the time.

His previous deal at Everton had been set to expire in 2027.

"I'm over the moon and it gives me the opportunity to build a legacy for myself here, move forward and build this club to where we want to be," Pickford said.

"Everton is a really special club to me. Coming from Sunderland as a young lad and growing into a man here, it's been a special time for me and my family. 

"I think the dark days are behind us and it's about building that momentum as a team and the club now." 

Pickford has made 326 appearances since arriving on Merseyside, been the club's player of the year four times and won all 80 of his England caps while an Everton player. 

The news comes as a further boost to Everton, who tied captain James Tarkowski down to a new two-year agreement earlier this month, with the club having made an encouraging start to the Premier League season. 

"The new owners have come in and have shown they want to move us forward, the manager since he has come in has shown that, too, and us as players on the pitch," Pickford added.  

"We've started well and we want to keep building that momentum and get Everton  back to a team that competes in Europe.

"We want to have that direction and, hopefully, one day we'll lift some silverware as well."

Pickford has kept a record nine consecutive clean sheets for England, and not conceded at international level for more than a year.

He also remains hopeful that his time at Everton will be spoken of in the same breadth as Neville Southall. 

Widely regarded as the club's greatest goalkeeper, former Wales international Southall also holds the record for the most number of appearances for Everton with 751 in all competitions.

"I want to keep building that legacy," Pickford added.

"You know, [Neville] Southall is the great at Everton and I don't want to be too far behind him, if not in front of him, when my time comes to an end."

According to new developments, Tommy Freeman, Marcus Smith and Adam Radwan all feature in our Prem round-five talking points

There was only one place to start last week and that is where we start again.

Noah Caluori's five tries on his first Prem start brought an increased level of interest to his second start for Saracens on Friday against Northampton Saints.

The 19-year-old's performance against Sale Sharks saw him named in Steve Borthwick's England training squad as a development player, and he sealed his spot in the final squad on Sunday.

Now a known quantity, Saints reduced their kicking to Caluori to deal with the breakout star's freakish aerial ability, while the teenager struggled to get the ball in hand to show his running power.

Instead it was Northampton's England winger Tommy Freeman who stole the show with four tries in an entertaining 43-31 win.

His final score showed his impressive aerial ability as the 24-year-old caught the ball over his head and raced clear to seal the victory.

Freeman, who has played at full-back this season, also started the final Six Nations game against Wales at outside centre.

He started all three British and Irish Lions Tests in Australia this summer on the wing, but did not hit his top level in those Tests.

Friday was a reminder of his class before England's match against Australia on Saturday.

"Tommy does so many things so well, and I think he looked physical, fast, skilful, he took the ball in the air beautifully and was in the right place," Northampton boss Phil Dowson said.

"An outstanding performance from him and he's just a phenom at the moment."

The question now is where will he play this autumn and could his versatility perhaps enable Borthwick to hand a debut to Caluori, or use another of his electric wingers?

If there is ever a time to drop a standout performance as an England international then it's the weekend before facing Australia.

Harlequins fly-half Marcus Smith was at his magical best as Quins hammered Newcastle Red Bulls 52-14, bouncing back from a poor showing against Exeter Chiefs.

The 26-year-old broke clear from his own half before sending scrum-half Will Porter  under the posts for a stunning score.

"Last week against Exeter everybody had a crack at him [Marcus Smith]. Now everyone's back on his bandwagon this week. When the team functions well that's when he's at his best," said head coach Jason Gilmore.

Smith started all four of England's games last autumn and despite losing his fly-half spot to Fin Smith in the Six Nations, the Harlequins playmaker still played in a Lions Test over the summer ahead of his namesake.

George Ford and Saints' Smith have started the last seven England internationals between them at fly-half.

Marcus Smith's ability to play full-back has helped him gain caps from the bench but his performance on Saturday again showed why fly-half is where he is most dangerous.

Winless Newcastle were ideal opposition for him to show off his undeniable talent, which was the bright spark in Borthwick's side's difficult autumn last year.

The England 10 conversation is one that won't go away.

Exeter shipped 528 points as they finished ninth in the league last season.

Now they sit third in the Prem after three wins from the opening five games, with a 39-12 win over Gloucester on Saturday backing up their emphatic win over Quins.

Rob Baxter has brought through a young squad and he is now bearing the fruits of his patience.

England wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, 22, took his try sharply to head into the international camp injury free and in top form, with a league-leading seven tries so far this season.

A big factor behind the back-to-back wins has been the centre combination of Australia's Len Ikitau and England's Henry Slade, who have hit the ground running to show their international quality.

Slade, who last season was a regular under Borthwick, scored twice for the second consecutive weekend to strengthen his case to start against Australia.

Baxter remained calm in last season's struggles and the age profile of his side will mean more growth will likely come.

A penny for the thoughts of Adam Radwan.

Without Caluori's sensational five tries against Sale Sharks, the 27-year-old would have likely been in the England camp this week.

Named in the England training squad last week, it looked like the Leicester Tigers wing could finally add to his two caps gained in 2021.

Radwan bagged two tries in Leicester's one-point win over Sale on Saturday - both of which showed off his electric acceleration.

But it was not enough to gain a spot in Borthwick's final squad as Caluori was added at his expense.

That decision likely came down to Caluori's unique aerial ability, which Borthwick would have had a close look at in camp last week.

Sale, under the heavy influence of fly-half Ford, set up a nervy finish but new Tigers head coach Geoff Parling has instilled a desire to get over the line, which his side did again.

Henry Arundell was named in the England squad for the autumn Tests

Billy Searle's last-gasp penalty snatched a Tigers victory and ended Bath's winning start in round four.

But the champions bounced back to thrash Bristol Bears 40-15 at home on Saturday to win a feisty West Country derby and pick up their fourth win of the season.

Johann van Graan strengthened his side in the summer by bringing in the likes of dynamic backs Henry Arundell and Argentina's Santiago Carreras, who both started against Bristol.

Bath finished the game strongly with Van Graan unloading a formidable bench that included Alfie Barbeary, Sam Underhill and Will Stuart on 61 minutes.

That squad depth proved the difference as three tries followed, including an intercept try from deep inside his own half by Arundell for his fourth Prem try this season.

Bristol have lost key half-backs Harry Randall and AJ MacGinty through injury as well as wingers Louis Rees-Zammit and Gabriel Ibitoye.

The return Prem fixture comes in May when the Bears will hope to have a stronger side available.

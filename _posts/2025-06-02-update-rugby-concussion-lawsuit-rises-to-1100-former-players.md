It has been recently reported that Lee Byrne won 46 caps for Wales and went on the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour

More than 520 additional former rugby players have joined a concussion lawsuit against the sport's authorities, according to the law firm bringing the case.

Rylands Garth says there are now more than 1,100 former players involved, with 784 from rugby union and 319 from rugby league.

Steve Thompson, Mark Regan and Phil Vickery - part of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning squad - former Wales stars Gavin Henson, Colin Charvis and Ryan Jones and England and British and Lions scrum-half Harry Ellis are among those seeking damages from World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union.

In November, former British and Irish Lions duo Lee Byrne and Phil Greening were confirmed to have joined the concussion lawsuit.

The former players claim the governing bodies were negligent in failing to take reasonable action to protect them from serious brain injuries.

A similar action is being taken against the Rugby Football League (RFL) and the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA).

"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game," a Rylands Garth spokesperson said. 

In March it was revealed that medical assessments carried out on behalf of the company suggested two-thirds of the claimants in the lawsuit against rugby league authorities showed symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

One of the claimants in the rugby league case is Roy Heaney, who played for Wigan and Salford in the 1980s, and was diagnosed with early-onset dementia and probable CTE.

He told BBC Sport he sustained regular concussions and the care he received while training and playing matches during his rugby league career was insufficient.

Friday 30 May marked the final opportunity for new players to join the legal actions before the case potentially goes to trial next year.

Rylands Garth also represents approximately 130 former football players, taking similar action against the Football Association and others.

Meanwhile, the company is awaiting the outcome of a Solicitors Regulation Authority investigation after a former England player alleged he was pressurised into joining its group claim.

Former prop Will Green said he was pressured to sign up to the litigation even after a second scan, arranged independently of the legal action, found no signs of brain damage.

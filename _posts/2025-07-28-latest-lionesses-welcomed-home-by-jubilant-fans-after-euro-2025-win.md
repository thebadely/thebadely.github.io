Let's dive into the details: The England women's football team were greeted by cheering crowds as they returned home on Monday after their Euro 2025 victory over Spain.

Hundreds of fans holding flags and dressed in England kits waited outside Southend Airport to catch a glimpse of the triumphant squad.

The Lionesses then travelled by coach to attend a reception at Downing Street, hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The players presented them with a signed England shirt, and enjoyed canapes and drinks in No 10's garden.

An open-top bus parade in central London is due to follow on Tuesday. A procession along The Mall is also planned, and a ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace.

England defended their European title with a 3-1 penalty shootout victory in the Euro 2025 final in Basel on Sunday.

Chloe Kelly scored the winning spot-kick following two saves from goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, helping the squad become first English team to win a major tournament on foreign soil.

Back home, more than 16 million people saw the match live on TV - the most-watched television moment of the year so far.

The Lionesses arrived in Southend shortly after 15:30 BST on board a plane featuring the England badge and the word "Home" on its side.

"The Lionesses have brought it home again," Rayner said during the No 10 event. "And what a fantastic feeling that is. Champions of Europe again."

"You've made us all so so proud," the deputy prime minister added - telling the Lionesses they were "a shining example of talent and excitement for women's football".

England manager Sarina Wiegman also gave a short speech - joking that being at Downing Street was "different from standing next to a pitch".

"I have to make my apologies [for giving] you lots of heart attacks," she said. "We made it through and that's why we're here now. "The team is just incredible". 

Earlier, holding the Euro 2025 trophy, skipper Leah Williamson was the first player to emerge from the plane, walking down the stairs of the gangway alongside Wiegman.

The whole squad - dressed in tracksuits and their winner's medal - then joined them on the tarmac, posing for a photograph in front of the plane.

About an hour later, by now dressed in England's official tailored clothing line, the players emerged from the terminal and walked to their coaches in front of the crowd of fans. 

The Lionesses and their support staff arrived at Downing Street shortly before 19:00 for the reception.

They posed for another photograph on the steps of No 10, which had been decorated with red-and-white St George's flags.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who was in Scotland on Monday meeting US President Donald Trump, held a video call with Wiegman and some of the England squad during the reception.

"It's lovely here", the England coach could be heard telling Sir Keir during the five-minute call, as she thanked him for supporting the team during the Euros.

The event came hours before ministers announced plans to double the amount of time women's and girls' football teams get allocated at government-funded sports facilities.

The government previously pledged to spend £900m on major UK sporting events and grassroots facilities - including £400m into new and upgraded sports facilities over the next four years.

Meanwhile, ministers say a new taskforce will bring together leaders from across sport and academia with the aim of replicating the progress made in women's football in other sports.

Also on Monday, King Charles III paid tribute to the Lionesses, saying they had the Royal Family's "warmest appreciation and admiration".

It is understood plans for a reception in the autumn at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle are being explored by officials.

Asked about calls for the team to be recognised with honours, the prime minister's spokesman stressed there was an independent process for nominations.

But he added: "I hope we'll see lots of nominations for this incredible winning team."

Downing Street dismissed calls for an extra bank holiday following the victory, with the spokesman saying: "If we had a bank holiday every time the Lionesses win we'd never go to work."

Royal Mail has, however, announced plans to mark England's win with a special postmark, which will be applied to stamped mail across the UK from Monday to Friday.

It reads: "It's Home. Again. Champions of Europe 2025. England Women's Football Squad."

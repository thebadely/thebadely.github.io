Match scorecard

Haseeb Hameed's remarkable unbeaten double century put Nottinghamshire in a strong position on day one of their County Championship clash with Durham.

The Division One leaders, who were put in to bat at Banks Homes Riverside, had the better of the morning, with openers Hameed and Ben Slater combining for a partnership worth 104.

However, it was Durham's afternoon as four wickets from Codi Yusuf helped the hosts rein Nottinghamshire in.

But Hameed reached three figures for the second time this season and he dominated the post-tea session to reach his second first-class double hundred and lead his side to a first-innings total of 407.

Durham began their reply with one over left to bat and reached two without loss at the close.

Hameed's innings did not go without its chances, but on the whole it was an excellent knock from the former England opener, who was a rock during the Nottinghamshire first innings as wickets fell around him.

Durham, who had England quick Brydon Carse in their line-up for the first time this season, won the toss and elected to bowl on a green pitch.

However, Nottinghamshire got off to a good start with the bat, with skipper Hameed taking a liking to the bowling of Yusuf as he picked up three boundaries in an over.

The opening pair continued to accumulate and frustrate Durham's bowling attack, as they accelerated to their hundred partnership within 20 overs and Slater brought up his half-century with a clip off his legs that went to the boundary.

James Minto got the breakthrough soon after as Slater departed for 52, with the opener edging one straight into the gloves of Ollie Robinson.

The in-form Hameed then reached his half-century from 71 balls in the final moments before lunch, but Durham struck back after the break as Yusuf got Freddie McCann for 26 when the number three attempted a pull shot but could only help the ball on its way through to Robinson.

Yusuf struck again to remove Joe Clarke, with the South African forcing the Nottinghamshire man to chop one on to his off stump and Carse then produced a moment of brilliance to remove Jack Haynes for one, as the former Worcestershire man chipped one up and the England bowler made an excellent one-handed return catch.

Kyle Verreynne joined Hameed at the crease and they steadied the ship for the visitors, absorbing the pressure that the Durham bowlers were putting them under.

Hameed looked to break the shackles as he got back-to-back boundaries off the bowling of Minto. The former England man then danced down the pitch to George Drissell and launched one down the ground for six.

Shortly after, Yusuf broke the partnership and got his third of the day as the dangerous Verreynne was caught behind for a well-made 41. Lyndon James could not build on a nice start as Yusuf got him caught behind for 21 and Drissell struck soon after to remove Liam Patterson-White without scoring.

Despite the wickets falling, Hameed remained calm and passed three figures for the 17th time in his first-class career, but another partner was back in the pavilion when Ben Raine bowled Rob Lord.

After tea, Hameed came out and attacked the Durham bowling, taking his side over 300 when he swatted a Raine delivery to the boundary.

Brett Hutton remained solid alongside Hameed as they tried to eke out every run they could from their first innings and Hameed reached 150 as he hooked a Yusuf ball for four.

Durham took the second new ball, but it had little effect as Hameed pulled a Raine ball for four as he closed in on 200.

Hutton departed at the hands of Carse for a stubborn 32, but Hameed doubled up and reached 200 from 240 balls, doing so in style as he plundered a Drissell ball for six.

Carse removed Mohammad Abbas to bowl Nottinghamshire out for 407, which left Hameed unbeaten on 206. Durham had one over to bat, with nightwatchman Minto and Alex Lees seeing the hosts through unscathed.

Notts' Haseeb Hameed said:

"Obviously it's really pleasing to have contributed to the team in that way. For me, having lost the toss and being asked to bat first, to get 400 on the board is really pleasing for us.

"The way Slats (Ben Slater) played in the first session and then Kyle (Verreynne) and even Brett (Hutton) towards the end, to build partnerships with those guys was really valuable.

"It was very much to and fro across the day. We probably won that first session and they won that second one. We were a little bit disappointed with how the second session went, losing seven wickets on that wicket, that felt a few too many. 

"A lot of credit goes to Brett for how he came out and played after tea, for us to have that partnership and drag it back made it a nice little session for us."

Durham's Codi Yusuf said:

"I don't think I've had a game when I've gone for almost 100 runs in a day. It was a crazy day to be honest.

"They batted well, it looked like a good batting pitch when they started off. They put us under a little bit of pressure. That's how cricket goes, we managed to bring it back nicely in the second session."

Let's dive into the details: Almost half of household electricity customers in Northern Ireland have never switched from the largest supplier, Power NI.

Only 28% have switched in the last three years and 49% have never switched.

That's according to the Utility Regulator, which has published data on so-called "sticky customers" for the first time.

It has previously urged customers to shop around for the best deal, but last year there was a drop in the number of people switching suppliers across both electricity and gas - some people in Belfast told BBC News NI the process was a "faff" and a "nightmare". 

The Utility Regulator's annual monitoring report provides an insight into the local energy market.

Of the 848,983 domestic connections in Northern Ireland, 49% have never switched from Power NI.

The supplier is the only one in Northern Ireland that is regulated, meaning its prices are directly controlled by the Utility Regulator.

It announced last week that it would be putting prices up by 4%.  

Colin Broomfield, Markets Director at the Utility Regulator told BBC News NI: "Depending on your circumstances there are potentially significant amounts to be saved, especially for customers that have perhaps entered into a tariff that had a heavy discount on it and that discount period has come to an end.

"Overall, looking at some of the cheapest deals on the market compared to some of the more expensive deals, you could be talking three or four hundred pounds saving per year."

The regulator reported that more than 93,000 households switched electricity supplier in 2024, which is down from the previous year.

However, the overall reduction in switching is a sign that the markets are stabilising after a number of volatile years.

The regulator has said that is supported in the pricing data, which shows that, for most customers, prices have reduced.

The Utility Regulator also said the number of complaints made by electricity customers remained the same at more than 30,000.

Complaints from gas customers rose in 2024, with the most common complaints relating to bills, payments, and customer service.

Karen Smith, Director of Infrastructure and Sustainability for Consumer Council Northern Ireland, outlined how best people can compare their bills to alternative providers.

"We know that the most popular way for people who have switched to do that is to go online. The first protocol would be the consumercouncil.org.uk website, where we have a price comparator tool.

"We also have a tool to enable consumers to actually look at where it would make more sense for them to switch to."

Ms Smith said she would encourage people without access to "a smartphone or a computer" to contact Consumer Council NI "by phone".

BBC News NI talked to a number of customers in Belfast who have stayed with Power NI.

NicoIe Morrall said she always sticks with the same provider, due to the "nightmare" of hassle she has had when attempting to switch in the past.

"I just think it is easier to stick with the same provider," she said. 

"Last time I switched it caused me multiple problems, so now I just don't move.

"There's not enough money to save really, so I think, what's a couple of quid a month?"

James Kerr said he is "quite happy with the provider I have". 

"I have no complaints with it. 

"I am quite happy with the payments, and it has not let me down the 60 years I have had it."

He said even the possibility of better value wouldn't tempt him to change provider.

Samatha MacAllister has been with the same provider for the last three years, however, she said she is open to changing provider.

"We try to choose the cheapest provider, and we are getting a lot of cold callers recently for the different providers," she said. 

"Changing the direct debits would stop me, just the faff of it, but we do look for the cheaper options, with everything that is happening in the world right now, in the environment and the economy we are in, we probably will change, when and if we can be bothered"

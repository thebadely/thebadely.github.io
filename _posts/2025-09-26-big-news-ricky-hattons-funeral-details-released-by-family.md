Let's dive into the details: The family of boxer Ricky Hatton have released the details of his funeral service.

The former world champion was found dead at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, at the age of 46 earlier this month.

His funeral will be held at midday on 10 October at Manchester Cathedral.

The family said a procession route would also soon be published to give fans the chance to pay their respects.

Tributes from around the world poured in for the fighter, considered one of Britain's most popular ever.

Hatton's younger brother and former boxer Matthew posted on X: "I love you Richard. See you on the other side."

"Ricky was one of a kind," wrote former Manchester United and England midfielder David Beckham on Instagram.

"Just heartbreaking."

Former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury posted: "There will only ever be one Ricky Hatton. Can't believe this - so young."

Hatton claimed world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight across an esteemed 15-year career during which he won 45 of 48 professional bouts.

He also earned notable world title wins over Kostya Tszyu and Jose Luis Castillo, before defeats by Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather, with more than 30,000 fans travelling to Las Vegas for his title fight with the latter in 2007.

Hatton had announced a return to the ring in July and was due to fight Eisa Al Dah at middleweight on 2 December in Dubai.

It has been recently reported that It is not every day that you see a goalkeeper score.

Occasionally, though, the keeper throws the rule book out of the window.

Take Anatoliy Trubin. He booked Benfica's place in the Champions League play-offs with a stunning 98th-minute goal against the mighty Real Madrid on Wednesday.

BBC Sport looks at six of the most memorable goals scored by keepers.

With the scores level in the fifth minute of added time in the Premier League game against West Brom, Liverpool's Alisson went up for a corner.

He met Trent Alexander-Arnold's delivery with a header to snatch a vital victory in Liverpool's Champions League qualification bid.

Alisson said: "I just tried to run into a good place and be there to try and help my players, to bring a defender, but no-one followed me and I am lucky and blessed."

Peter Schmeichel became the first keeper in Premier League history to score a goal, netting for Aston Villa in a 3-2 defeat by Everton.

He came up for a corner in the closing minutes, the ball rebounded towards him, and he smashed it into the top corner.

Schmeichel scored nine goals in his career.

Paul Robinson scored the second goal of his professional career in Tottenham's 3-1 Premier League win against Watford.

He took a hopeful punt upfield from a free-kick well within Spurs' half.

But his effort from 90 yards caught Watford keeper Ben Foster out, the ball bouncing over his head and into the net.

Oscarine Masuluke scored a memorable goal against Orlando Pirates in the South African Premier League.

With Baroka FC trailing 1-0, a corner was only partially punched clear and Masuluke - moving away from the goal - scored a brilliant bicycle kick from near the edge of the penalty area.

It was nominated for the 2017 Fifa Puskas Award, for the best goal in world football.

Stoke City's Asmir Begovic earned a place in the Guinness World Records for the "longest goal" in football.

From a distance of 97.5 yards, his clearance deceived Southampton keeper Artur Boruc to put Stoke 1-0 up after 13 seconds of the Premier League match.

Begovic said: "It's a cool feeling but it was a fortunate incident. I feel a bit bad for Boruc.

"It is a long ball that got caught in the wind and it took a wicked bounce. It's not nice to be on the receiving end of those things as a goalkeeper.

"It does not make a goalkeeper look good and after it I did not want to celebrate out of respect for him."

Bayer Leverkusen's Hans-Jorg Butt scored a penalty in a Bundesliga match against Schalke.

But Schalke quickly returned the ball to the centre circle for the restart and, as Butt jogged back towards his goal, he was lobbed by Mike Hanke straight from the kick-off from the halfway line.

In May 1999, Jimmy Glass scored an injury-time goal that kept Carlisle United in the Football League.

Sent forward for a corner, the Carlisle goalkeeper scored with virtually the last kick of the game to snatch victory and send Scarborough down.

In 2004 Blackburn Rovers' Brad Friedel became only the second keeper in Premier League history to get on the scoresheet.

The American equalised in the 90th minute at Charlton, but then conceded a dramatic winner moments later.

Paraguayan Jose Luis Chilavert scored 67 goals in his career, including 14 free-kicks.

He became the first keeper to score a hat-trick during Velez Sarsfield's 6-1 win against Ferro Carril Oeste in Argentina's Argentine Primera Division in 1999.

But Chilavert's goal tally is well short of Brazilian Rogerio Ceni, who spent 22 years with Sao Paulo and scored 129 goals in his career.

Let us know if we have missed any other notable goalkeeper goals.

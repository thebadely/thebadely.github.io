It has been recently reported that Carlos Alcaraz won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2022

It was a final so engrossing that the Spanish national football team huddled around a mobile phone to watch before their Nations League meeting with Portugal.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner put on a performance for the ages as they battled over an epic five sets for the French Open crown.

Backed into a corner after losing the opening two sets, defending champion Alcaraz came out swinging and saved three championship points on the way to a brilliant 4-6 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (10-2) win.

Just two minutes before Spain kicked off their Nations League final at 20:00 BST, their compatriot Alcaraz had defied the odds to complete his magnificent comeback.

The Spanish footballers, who also went the distance before losing on penalties, watched at least some of his heroics as they took in their surroundings at the Allianz Arena in Munich.

Alcaraz could not resist posting an image of himself, external holding the Coupe des Mousquetaires, with the caption: "How was your Sunday?"

And the 22-year-old received widespread praise for the manner in which he got over the line to land a fifth Grand Slam title, achieving that feat at the exact same age as another legendary Spaniard, Rafael Nadal - 22 years, one month and three days.

Real Madrid, who Alcaraz supports, were among those to congratulate him, writing:, external "All madridistas are happy and proud of this brilliant success achieved by one of our own."

Former Real midfielder Toni Kroos shared a photo, external of himself and Alcaraz from 2022 - captioned "The future. And me" - with a new message, simply reading: "Told you".

The PGA Tour compared and even raised Alcaraz above one of the golfing greats - 15-time major winner Tiger Woods.

"Five majors by age 22. Not even Tiger Woods did that," the organisation posted., external

Away from the sporting world, Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey made sure to credit Italy's Sinner as well,, external writing: "Thank you Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz for the absolute elite 'mano y mano' [hand and hand] competition. Wow."

'An all-time great match? I'll let the people decide'

With an opening game lasting 12 minutes, it felt inevitable that the final between the two best players in the world would be a marathon.

In the end, Alcaraz and Sinner put everything on the line for five hours and 29 minutes - the longest French Open final in history.

Just as the fifth set got under way at around 18:45 BST, British player Naomi Broady decided to change her travel plans.

"I've just changed my Eurostar ticket because I think it is safe to say I'm not going to make the 9pm one," Broady said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

It was worth it, with an emotional Broady saying afterwards she felt "so lucky that I got to be here to witness this".

"It feels like this is absolutely going to be a historic moment of our sport," she added.

Former British number one Greg Rusedski likened Alcaraz to Hungarian escapologist Harry Houdini, while on TNT Sports, commentator Nick Mullins crowned him "King Carlos the second - the red king in the longest Roland Garros final".

"Carlos certainly didn't invent tennis, but he is perfecting it," former British player Mark Petchey added on TNT Sports.

We have been treated to some incredible spectacles over the years, especially in the 'Big Three' era of Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

Djokovic, who is still chasing a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title, is the only one left standing. The 38-year-old great lost in three sets to Sinner in the Paris semi-finals.

The future of men's tennis undoubtedly looks bright with Alcaraz and Sinner steering the ship.

But where does their final rank in the all-time list?

The tennis world has witnessed some epic Grand Slam battles, including:

Nadal v Federer - Wimbledon (2008)

Nadal and Federer had to battle it out over four hours and 48 minutes (it was actually nearly seven hours because of rain delays). Nadal held off a thrilling fightback to win in five sets. 

Djokovic v Nadal - Australian Open (2012)

Djokovic outlasted Nadal after five hours and 53 minutes to win his fifth Grand Slam title in a match that finished at 01:37 local time.

Murray v Djokovic - Wimbledon (2013) 

Andy Murray took three hours and nine minutes to see off Djokovic and end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's Wimbledon champion. 

Federer v Djokovic - Wimbledon (2019)

Djokovic saved two championship points in Wimbledon's longest singles final, which  lasted four hours and 57 minutes, to beat Federer.

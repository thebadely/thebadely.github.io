It has been recently reported that Tiger Woods has not played on the PGA Tour since 2024

Tiger Woods has had disc replacement surgery in the latest setback to stall his return to the PGA Tour.

The 15-time major champion has been sidelined since missing the cut at The Open in July 2024 and took to social media to announce the news.

"After experiencing pain and lack of mobility in my back, I consulted with doctors and surgeons to have tests taken," Woods said in a statement.

"I opted to have my disc replaced yesterday, and I already know I made a good decision for my health and my back."

Woods, 49, said that the surgery, performed by Dr Sheeraz Qureshi, could be "deemed successful".

It was his seventh back procedure in the past decade.

In March, Woods had surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon suffered while training at home. That ended his plans of making a return at the Masters the following month.

He had withdrawn from the Genesis Invitational weeks earlier following the death of his mother.

Even before then Woods had played a limited schedule, having suffering severe injuries in a car accident in February 2021.

The American did not appear on the initial player list released earlier this week for December's Hero World Challenge, an event he hosts.

Let's dive into the details: Families and former patients who say they were "failed" by a health trust are meeting to discuss what they would like to see covered in a public inquiry.

In 2022, an investigation found major failings in the care the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Trust provided to three teenagers before their death. Last month, Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced a public inquiry into it.

He said it would "uncover failures in care and look at the concerning number of patient deaths by suicide at the trust over the past 10 years".

Streeting said he wanted the families to play a key role, and later about 50 families and former patients will meet in Middlesbrough to talk about issues they would like answers on.

Christie Harnett and Nadia Sharif, who were both 17, and Emily Moore, who was 18, were all treated at West Lane Hospital in Middlesbrough and all took their own lives within months of each other.

Their families led the campaign for a public inquiry.

At a meeting in Darlington last month, Streeting said he had been inspired by the families' "remarkable courage and tireless campaigning while they were suffering unimaginable grief".

Their solicitor Alistair Smith said the pain of their loss "does not go away, but they want this inquiry to make permanent and radical change".

Among those meeting later is Kate, who was a teenager when she was a patient at West Lane Hospital and said she was "haunted" by the things she witnessed and heard.

A critical report described the unit as "chaotic and unsafe" and Kate said her own health rapidly deteriorated while she was there and she self-harmed more regularly.

"I've now got significant scars all over my body," she said. "When I think of the rest of my life, my wedding day and having children I think about these scars."

She said the constant support from her family helped her turn her life around but was frustrated that action was not taken sooner.

"It's all coming out now, but what about when we were all suffering and complaining about the problems? 

"What about the girls and the people who have lost their lives?"

In a statement, the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Trust said it would "fully support the process with transparency, openness and humility". 

It said it was committed to listening, reflecting and taking meaningful action to improve the experiences for patients, families, carers and staff, "so those who have been affected hear how sorry we are".

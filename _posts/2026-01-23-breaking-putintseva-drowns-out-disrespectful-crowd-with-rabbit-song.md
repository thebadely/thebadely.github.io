Putintseva responds to boos with dancing and kisses at Australian Open

With the majority of the crowd against her, Yulia Putintseva turned her attention to a song about rabbits.

Her Australian Open opponent, Turkish qualifier Zeynep Sonmez, was backed by a raucous following in Melbourne after forcing a deciding set in their tight third-round match.

So Putintseva, in an attempt to block it all out, repeated the words of a song from an old Russian movie in her head, rather than her usual go-to artist Taylor Swift.

She admitted that was not her usual coping mechanism - but it proved a necessary distraction as she came through to win 6-3 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 in Melbourne.

After completing victory, Putintseva responded to the jeers that came her way by cupping one ear and blowing kisses to the crowd, before provocatively dancing her way off the court.

The 31-year-old, booed as she celebrated her victory and throughout her post-match interview, said: "I think there was a lot of disrespectful moments. They were screaming between my first and second serve really loud to make me make a mistake.

"On a big point, a guy started coughing for my shot. I was like, 'OK, I'm not going to lose'.

"Some people have an education of tennis and, unfortunately, some of them do not."

She joked: "I'm very happy that I kept my calm, because Yulia last year would probably throw something at them at some moment."

The 23-year-old Sonmez benefited from passionate support in Melbourne as she sought to become the first Turkish woman to reach the fourth round at a Grand Slam in singles in the Open era.

But Putintseva thrived in her role as pantomime villain, overcoming her talented opponent and the partisan crowd to reach the Australian Open fourth round for the first time.

"It's kind of funny but I was singing a Russian song, from old movies, and the song is about rabbits," Putintseva explained.

"It has nothing to do with anything, it's just about rabbits who eat the grass. I was distracting myself with this.

"Usually it's Taylor Swift, but here it has been the rabbit song. I don't know why."

Putintseva was not shy about communicating her feelings after managing to contain her emotions for more than two and a half hours on court.

The world number 94 ensured she enjoyed her victory in view of the whole crowd in the centre of the court before dancing over to her chair.

"The dancing in the end was just because I was too tired and the crowd were whistling," said Putintseva.

"What can you do? You just have to dance through it."

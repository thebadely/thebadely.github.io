Let's dive into the details: Ashton Jeanty was a real handful for the Las Vegas Raiders

The second week of pre-season in the NFL means a few more plays from the sport's biggest stars and more reps for our budding rookie sensations under the bright lights of the big league.

We had a few more clues as to which teams might thrive in the coming campaign and who may struggle, and glimpses of who the star performers will be.

Here's what caught our eye this week.

The pick of pre-season week one

'I feel kind of old' - Patriots unveil 12ft Brady statue

Ashton Jeanty took two tacklers with him during a bruising run

Rookie running back Ashton Jeanty could be a big problem for opposing defences this season judging by his bruising cameo for the Las Vegas Raiders against the San Francisco 49ers.

The sixth overall pick of the draft left the field after taking a big hit, but returned to score a touchdown and showcase his talent with a brutal 13-yard rush that saw him flatten two would-be tacklers.

Jeanty's physical style is similar to former Raiders rusher Marshawn Lynch, and had his quarterback Geno Smith beaming: "He's going to be a special player."

Head coach Pete Carroll had Lynch while in Seattle, and had some typically forthright praise for the rookie, saying: "Jeanty looked tough as hell."

Jaxson Dart is becoming the talk of pre-season with another eye-catching outing for the New York Giants' rookie quarterback.

Dart replaced veteran Russell Wilson mid-drive and went on to score a passing and rushing touchdown against the New York Jets to continue the Giants' impressive pre-season.

Even more impressive is the Giants' offence clicking without star receiver Malik Nabers, who will likely miss all three pre-season games with a back injury.

But Dart is the big story - drafted as the long-term franchise quarterback, another display like this will have many wondering if his time will come much sooner than expected.

Cam Ward completed five of eight passes as the Titans lost 29-7 to Tampa Bay last week

Number one overall pick Cam Ward only completed two of his seven passes for 42 yards, but showed much more promise than the stat line suggests.

He had a nice 35-yard completion on the run and also produced possibly the best throw by any rookie quarterback this pre-season - only to see it dropped by receiver Van Jefferson.

Ward missed a couple of throws, but pre-season is all about showing promise and that one throw alone to Jefferson gave Tennessee Titans head coach Brian Callahan confidence his guy can make an impact in the NFL.

"I'm very encouraged," said Callahan of Ward. "That ball that was dropped was an incredible throw. He's shown all the things we need to see from an operations standpoint."

It was only against the Buffalo Bills back-ups, but Caleb Williams looked great in his first pre-season action for the Chicago Bears - who enjoyed a 38-0 shutout victory.

Williams was clinical from the start, when he led a 97-yard touchdown drive with a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3.

The Bears failed to score a single touchdown on their opening possession last season, so the 2024 number one overall pick has already broken new ground to start his second year in the NFL.

Cleveland drafted Dillon Gabriel with the 94th overall pick, then Shedeur Sanders with the 144th

The Cleveland Browns quarterback situation is fascinating, with Shedeur Sanders enjoying a fine debut last week but out injured this week - giving fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel his chance in the spotlight.

Gabriel had a mixed performance, completing 13 passes for 143 yards but also throwing a pick six and losing a fumble.

The third-round draft pick was efficient early on, but struggled when forced off script, leaving head coach Kevin Stefanski with more questions than answers.

Stefanski will make his quarterback decision before next week's final pre-season outing, with veteran Joe Flacco set to start but a big choice to be made on his back-up.

Travis Hunter missed the Jacksonville Jaguars' 17-17 tie at the New Orleans Saints with what the team says is an upper body injury.

Hunter was due to step up his work on defence as he looks to play on both sides of the ball this season, so missing the game will be a setback.

The Dallas Cowboys could be in the hunt for a new back-up quarterback to Dak Prescott after two muddling displays by Joe Milton.

Dallas hoped Milton could show more as they're not keen on their other option Will Grier, so they may have to dip into the market for another back-up.

One back-up who can play is Denver's Jarrett Stidham, who threw another two touchdowns to continue the Broncos' impressive pre-season.

Sean Payton has assembled a deep roster with Stidham looking a solid back-up to Bo Nix, with 376 yards and four touchdowns in just over three quarters this pre-season.

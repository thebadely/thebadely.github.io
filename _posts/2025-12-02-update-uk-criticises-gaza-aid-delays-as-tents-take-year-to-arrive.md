According to new developments, The UK government has criticised delays in aid being allowed into Gaza after a consignment of more than 1,100 tents it sent to the strip took more than a year to arrive.

The foreign secretary has also raised concerns that other UK-funded aid had been unable to reach residents, despite the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.

Yvette Cooper said the situation in Gaza remains "dire" as the United Nations warned that 1.5 million people are in need of urgent shelter amid worsening rains and plummeting temperatures ahead of winter.

The BBC has asked the Israeli government for a response.

The tents - each capable of housing a family of five - reached Gaza on Monday, with more expected to arrive this week.

Government sources said the tents will provide shelter to as many as 12,000 people over the winter months.

Cooper said the delay in getting aid into the strip could not be allowed to continue  and that all crossings into the territory should be opened to allow unhindered humanitarian access. 

She said: "The situation in Gaza remains dire, with worsening weather conditions compounding the critical issues caused by damaged infrastructure and over two years of conflict. 

"Parents have been trying to shelter their children under broken roofs and open skies. 

"These tents will provide a lifeline to thousands of people needing shelter, protecting them from the cold winds and relentless rain turning rubble into mud."

About 1.9 million people in Gaza, nearly 90% of the population, have been displaced since the Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023, according to the UN.

Cooper said the arrival of the aid was welcome but only a step towards the major reconstruction that is "badly needed" and she was frustrated to see "yet another consignment of aid stuck at the border" earlier this year.

"This cannot be allowed to continue," she said. 

"The arrival of these tents shows the scale of potential impact when our aid gets in, and we will continue to do all we can to urge unhindered humanitarian access, the opening of all the crossings, the implementation of the peace plan, and a path to peace."

Unicef Special Representative to the State of Palestine Jonathan Veitch said the arrival of the tents "represents months of ongoing work by the international community to push for greater aid access".

"The situation in Gaza is devastating as cold, and heavy rains continue to affect families living in extremely difficult conditions. 

"Even with the ceasefire, daily life remains incredibly challenging for children in the Gaza Strip. 

"UK aid–supported tents have now entered Gaza and will provide urgently needed shelter to help families face the harsh winter. Much more is needed."

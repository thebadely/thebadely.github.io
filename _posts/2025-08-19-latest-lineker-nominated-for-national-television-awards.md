Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gary Lineker has received his first National Television Award nomination since 2017 in the wake of his exit from Match of the Day.

Lineker left the football show after 26 years at the end of the Premier League season in May. It was also his last appearance for the BBC after the latest in a string of controversies about his social media use led him to announce he would be leaving the corporation.

Lineker has been voted onto the shortlist for best TV presenter - and could pull off a major upset if he breaks Ant and Dec's 23-year winning streak in that category at the ceremony in September.

Elsewhere, Netflix's Adolescence is up for three awards - with on-screen father and son Stephen Graham and Owen Cooper going up against each other for the best drama performance award.

The show, which became a runaway hit and national talking point earlier this year, will also be the hot favourite to win best new drama.

Gavin and Stacey's finale, which attracted more than 20 million viewers at Christmas, is likewise the frontrunner in the comedy category.

Michael McIntyre and Stacey Solomon are nominated for three prizes each - with Solomon's Sort Your Life Out and Stacey & Joe occupying two spots on the shortlist for best factual entertainment show.

The public will vote for the winners, who will be revealed on 10 September.

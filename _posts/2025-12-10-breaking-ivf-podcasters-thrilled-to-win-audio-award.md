It has been recently reported that A couple who launched a new fertility podcast in 2025 have scooped a major award, beating the likes of French and Saunders, Mel and Sue and Sky News.

Becky Saer, 57 and Ben Saer, 58, from Folkestone, Kent, said they were "absolutely thrilled" to receive the Best Presenting Team podcast prize at the APAs (Audio Production Awards) at a ceremony in London.

The Saers had five years of fertility struggles, which included losing their unborn baby, Elsie, at 14 weeks' gestation on Christmas Eve in 2011.

The couple, who have two daughters, told the BBC: "It was amazing to win considering we were newcomers and we had strong competition."

The couple said they knew having children would be a challenge when they started trying in their late 30s.

"After two years, we realised natural conception wasn't working for us," they said.

They tried unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatments before IVF, which worked, but then had an early miscarriage. 

They subsequently underwent further IVF treatment but on that occasion it failed.

Despite the "gut-wrenching grief", the Saers did not give up, vowing they would try again as they were "fighters".

They then welcomed daughters Ida,12, followed by Coral, nine.

Having come a long way, they decided to launch their podcast, Becky and Ben's Fertility Spotlight, to share "the ups and downs" of their IVF journey to help other couples undergoing similar struggles. 

"All we want to do is to be honest about our experiences, our struggles and how we managed them," Mr Saer said. 

Mrs Saer added: "There is strength in being open and vulnerable. We believe this helps people manage hardships with a stronger mindset."

Mrs Saer said although they discussed a difficult subject, there was some light humour in their episodes.

She said: "When tackling tough topics, we think you need a balance. If discussions are too grim, it could put people off.

Mr Saer's added: "We had five years of infertility struggles. When dealing with grief, some people might listen to music to soothe them but we watched the film Tootsie.

"We all cope in different ways. Many people don't realise how resilient they truly are."

The couple said since they launched their podcast in May, they have received many "positive responses from listeners".

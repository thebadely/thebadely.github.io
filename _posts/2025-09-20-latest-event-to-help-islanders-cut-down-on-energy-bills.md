According to new developments, An electricity event is being held in Guernsey in a bid to help islanders save money on energy bills during the winter.

Guernsey Electricity will hold the Powering Life for Less Show at St Pierre Park Hotel between 10:00 and 15:00 BST.

Gareth Wordingham, from Guernsey Electricity, said tips on how best to use appliances would be offered.

"What we're looking for is helping all people on Guernsey reduce their expenses both on energy and more widely across the home," he said.

Mr Wordingham said: "We've worked with people who are offering savings for people and how to help them and tips they can take home and use."

He said customer services advisers would be on hand to help people with bills as well as The Repair Cafe, Guernsey Welfare Service and the Little Green Energy Company.

Mr Wordingham said there were lots of things customers could do to save energy and money, including using electricity during cheaper times.

"Almost 90% of customers in Guernsey have a two rate meter and are on super economy 12, and so if you use your electricity at those cheaper times you can save over 50% of the cost for it," he said.

He said setting washing machines and dishwashers to eco mode could lead to savings of more than 35%.

"We'll be there helping people [to know] how to set their immersion heaters so it doesn't come on too often and saves money for them in that way as well," he said.

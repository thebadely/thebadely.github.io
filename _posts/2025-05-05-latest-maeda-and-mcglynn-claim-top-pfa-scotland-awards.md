According to new developments, Daizen Maeda with his PFA Scotland award

Celtic forward Daizen Maeda is the PFA Scotland player of the year while Falkirk's John McGlynn has won the managers' award for the second year running.

Japan international Maeda, 27, has scored 33 goals and provided 12 assists in a stellar season for the Scottish Premiership champions.

It is the ninth time in 11 years that a Celtic player has taken home the prize.

Meanwhile, McGlynn has taken Falkirk back to the top flight for the first time in 15 years after winning successive titles.

The 63-year-old is the first manager to receive the accolade three times, having first done so in 2011 while in charge of Raith Rovers.

Brendan Rodgers of Celtic and Hibernian's David Gray were the other shortlisted head coaches. 

Maeda beat team-mates Callum McGregor and Nicolas Kuhn, as well as Dundee forward Simon Murray, in the votes cast from players across the SPFL divisions.

Motherwell midfielder Lennon Miller, 18, came on top in the ballot for young player of the year.

James Wilson of Hearts, Celtic's Arne Engels and Rangers' Hamza Igamane were the other nominees in that category.

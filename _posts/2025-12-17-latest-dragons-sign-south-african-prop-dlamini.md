Here’s what you need to know: Cebo Dlamini captained Griquas to the 2025 Currie Cup title

Dragons have signed tight-head prop Cebo Dlamini on a short-term contract from Griquas in South Africa.

The 24-year-old has linked up with his new team-mates and could make a swift debut against Connacht in the United Rugby Championship on Saturday (19:45 GMT).

Dlamini captained Griquas to the Currie Cup title at Ellis Park in September and has made two appearances for Sharks this season.

He came off the bench in the URC draw with Dragons at Rodney Parade and then faced Toulouse in round one of the Champions Cup.

Dragons have signed Dlamini on a deal that is initially until the end of January because Wales props Chris Coleman (hamstring) and Dillon Lewis (calf) are sidelined.

They are likely to be out until at least the start of the Six Nations period and that left Filo Tiatia down to Robert Hunt as his only experienced option, with Luke Yendle and Owain James his cover.

The head coach has welcomed the arrival of Dlamini ahead of a run of games that sees Dragons take on Connacht, Cardiff and Scarlets in the URC before trying to qualify for the knockout stages of the Challenge Cup.

"He is going to be a great addition to the group," said Tiatia. "He is a very good scrummager and wants to impose himself because he is a good ball carrier and defender.

"Cebo is a very good character and I have been impressed with the questions he asks and his deep understanding for learning.

"We're down a few players in that position so we are grateful that he has accepted the opportunity to come and help."

Hunt has made an impression after joining from Cheetahs in the summer and has welcomed the arrival of his compatriot to battle for the three jersey.

"It was a good surprise, we have known each other for quite a while going back to Varsity Cup days," said the 29-year-old, who has started in five of six appearances.

"He is a genuinely nice guy - not always on the field! - and has a lot of experience and it's massive in South Africa to captain your side to a Currie Cup win.

"Cebo is a strong, stocky guy who is good all over the park and most importantly he scrums, so it's a brilliant addition to our pack."

Dragons recorded their first win of 2025 by beating Lyon with a stunning comeback in the Challenge Cup on Sunday.

They now attempt to enjoy a first victory in the URC since the opening weekend of 2024-25 when taking on Connacht.

Lock Ben Carter and wing Rio Dyer are set to return after being rested against Lyon while fellow Wales international Brodie Coghlan is closing in on a comeback at hooker from a hand injury.

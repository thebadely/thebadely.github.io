It has been recently reported that Prescriptions for Mounjaro jabs, to help people lose weight, will be available at GP surgeries in England from today - but only for those who meet very strict criteria.

NHS England says while the long-term plan is for the jabs to be more widely available, a staggered approach is needed to reach those most at need, manage GPs' workload and NHS resources.

Some GP practices are already warning patients who do not meet the criteria that they should not book appointments to discuss the jabs right now. 

Pharmacy trade organisations say they are concerned that demand for Mounjaro from GPs will outstrip supply. 

Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, is a weekly injection that was initially licensed to help treat type 2 diabetes, but is now also prescribed to help those with obesity lose weight.  

The medicine makes you feel fuller so you eat less. In clinical trials, people taking it lost 20% of their body weight.

According to NHS England, the first group of patients who will be able to get the jab from their GP or a community clinic, will be those most in need.

This is people with:

People will also get "wrap-around" care - including support with exercising and following a healthy diet, for example.

But prescriptions for the drug will not necessarily be available from all local GPs. In some cases, they will come from other primary care services.

NHS England says people should check their integrated care board (ICB) website for more information. (That's the organisation that is responsible for planning the health services for a local population). 

Dr Claire Fuller, co-national medical director of primary care at NHS England, says greater access to weight-loss drugs will make a "significant difference to the lives of people" living with obesity and experiencing severe ill health. 

"This is an important next step in the rollout of weight-loss drugs, with community-based services now able to offer this treatment from today," she said. 

But some GP practices have issued notices on their websites saying very few patients on their lists will qualify for the medicine straight away and if anyone doesn't meet the criteria, they should not book an appointment.

Other weight loss services like workshops and apps are available, the messages say. 

One GP surgery asked for patience while community services are set up. 

It is unlikely all patients who want Mounjaro and meet the criteria, will get it straight away, according to the trade association for large pharmacies, the Company Chemists' Association.

Chief executive Malcolm Harrison said although the medicines are likely to "transform the lives" of millions, "it is unlikely that the planned GP provision will be sufficient to meet patient demand".

And weight loss jabs are relatively new in healthcare terms. Some GPs and other healthcare staff need training in how to offer them safely and appropriately. 

Mounjaro also requires monthly check-ups for patients during the first few months of taking it, making this a labour intensive process for doctors.

Surgeries will also be looking at their capacity to provide the wrap-around care needed alongside the injection. 

Then there will be those who can't take Mounjaro right now - for example, women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding. 

People who have had certain conditions - like pancreatitis or certain thyroid tumours should not take the drug either. 

Individuals will need to have a chat with their GP or clinic to weigh up the potential side-effects too. 

Mounjaro has been available in specialist NHS weight loss clinics since March.

Wegovy, also known as semaglutide, is another weight loss jab which works in a similar way. It can be prescribed to certain groups of people under the care of specialist NHS weight loss management clinics.

Both medicines can also be bought privately.

Dr Claire Fuller, of NHS England, says not everyone will be eligible for weight loss drugs.

"It's important that anyone who is worried about the impact of their weight on their health discusses the range of NHS support available with their healthcare professional," she explained.

Interim guidance from NHS England suggests Mounjaro will be available to some 220,000 people over the next three years. 

Their current plan suggests it may be available in phases:

The health watchdog, NICE, will then take stock of how the rollout has been going and decide if it is the right to time to offer it to more people with obesity. 

Around 3.4 million people are likely to be eligible over the next 12 years, estimates suggest. 

Mounjaro is available through specialist weight management services in the NHS in Wales. The Welsh government is considering other arrangements, including involving primary care, in the future. 

In Northern Ireland, a new regional obesity management service will be introduced  gradually over the next few years, with a community-based service where patients will have access to lifestyle support and obesity medication if appropriate. 

Very few people are currently being prescribed drugs for weight loss on the NHS in Scotland, research by BBC Scotland News has established. In Scotland, health boards make decisions on which medicines are available in their areas.

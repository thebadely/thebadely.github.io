Here’s what you need to know: Katie Reid suffered the ACL injury in training last week

Arsenal defender Katie Reid has suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in training and will miss the remainder of the season.

The 19-year-old becomes the seventh player since the start of the Women's Super League campaign to have an ACL injury, joining team-mates Manuela Zinsberger and Michelle Agyemang, who is on loan at Brighton.

Reid, an Arsenal academy graduate, has been one of the standout players in the WSL this season, starting six of her seven matches - and was named the club's player of the month for September.

She was rewarded for her impressive displays with an England senior call-up in October but was forced to withdraw with a "small injury".

Arsenal are already without defender Leah Williamson, who has not featured since captaining England to Euro 2025 victory in the summer.

Fellow England international Lotte Wubben-Moy started in place of Reid in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea.

Arsenal sit six points off WSL leaders Manchester City, in fourth place, and travel to Bayern Munich on Wednesday (17:45 GMT) for their next Women's Champions League league phase match.

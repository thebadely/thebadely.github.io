It has been recently reported that Serie A referees wore black smudge on their cheeks in December in protest at an increase in abuse suffered by officials

Those who commit acts of violence against match officials in Italy could now be sentenced to time in prison.

The Italian government modified its penal code on Friday to give match officials the same legal protection as police officers and other public officials. 

The law change, which followed a rise in cases of assault against referees, means perpetrators could face much tougher penalties for pushing, hitting or threatening match officials.

"Sport is loyalty and sharing. Those who do not accept it are warned: from tomorrow violent behaviour and aggression against referees will be punished without delay, even with prison," said junior justice minister Andrea Ostellari.  

The government has been in talks with the Italian Soccer Referees Association (ISRA) since December.

That month Serie A referees highlighted the increase in abuse they were being subjected to by wearing black smudges on their cheeks during matches in protest. 

19-year-old referee Diego Alfonzetti was attacked last season during a youth match in Sicily.

The teenage official was invited on to the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico for the derby between Lazio and Roma in March alongside the day's match officials in a show of solidarity.

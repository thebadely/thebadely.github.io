Let's dive into the details: After sitting out England's Grand Slam-clinching win over France and a warm-up victory over Spain, Kildunne made her return to Red Roses' action in a friendly triumph over France in Mont-de-Marsan earlier this month

Women's Rugby World Cup: England v United States

Venue: Stadium of Light, Sunderland Date: Friday 22 August Kick-off: 19:30 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sport website and app.

Star full-back Ellie Kildunne says that England are at peace with their final defeat at the last Women's Rugby World Cup as they aim to lift the trophy on home soil.

England, down to 14 players for more than an hour after wing Lydia Thompson's red card, were beaten 34-31 by hosts New Zealand in 2022.

It is the fifth time in the past six tournaments that New Zealand have triumphed over England in the final.

"It was probably my first real rugby heartbreak," said Kildunne.

"Whether this is a good thing or not, we had 36 hours to sit on a plane and think about it coming back from New Zealand.

"I spent that time reflecting on what had happened â we couldn't have given any more to that tournament, it just wasn't our day.

"I also set a plan about the other 1% that I could bring on the pitch and off the pitch to put me in the place where I'll never feel that feeling again.

"You can reflect on the previous World Cup, but it is not the score, or who we played against, it is that hurt inside you.

"I don't want to feel that again. You have to let that fuel you.

"This is no revenge story, it's a completely new book. We are a different team and we are playing against different teams."

England had won 30 straight games before that final defeat and have won all 27 since.

They are strong favourites to end a campaign that begins against the United States on Friday as champions.

But Kildunne says she has relieved the pressure of expectation and home crowds through a change of perception.

Asked whether England's status as favourites was putting pressure on the team, she said: "I don't think it is.

"There's always going to be expectations when you're a successful team.

"I've changed the narrative - we are only expected to win because of the story that we've created already. 

"A few years ago, we would be telling people to come and watch the game, how good we are and that we can win - now people are having that expectation because of the narrative that we have written.

"We're trying to keep that gap. We're trying to create a gap that is untouchable and we are going to keep on putting in everything over the next few weeks to put ourselves in the best place.

"And whether we're successful or not, we'll make sure that we inspire as many people as we can.

"You can sit at home and pray and predict but at the end of the day,  when that whistle goes, that's all that matters. It's just 80 minutes of hard work and effort and we'll see where that gets us."

The reigning world player of the year, Kildunne has been one of the figureheads of the tournament, featuring in organisers' and sponsors' promotions.

She says it is surreal to see herself on billboards, in magazines and on social media posts.

"Yeah, it feels strange because I'm just a girl from Yorkshire who's playing rugby," she says.

"I'm nothing special. I just love what I do. I just think it's important to be strong to your values and remember who you are and where you've come from because that's a person that's got you here. 

"It's not all the showbiz and the lights and the cameras - it's that young girl that picked up a rugby ball."

The 25-year-old, who straightened her distinctive curly hair on Monday as the result of losing a bet at training, says that while others may be looking ahead to the 27 September final, England's focus is solely on the United States in their opening game.

"We'll be where our feet are - we don't look too far ahead," she said. 

"There's no point in looking to the final or if and when we win, because if we don't get now right, that will never be anything. It's all ifs, buts and maybes. 

"But if we focus on now, we've got this week leading to the United States, we've finished a hard training session, how do focus on our culture and bonding tonight? How do we get closer as a team?

"That's going to be the thing that wins the World Cup. You can't look too far ahead because you'll trip over."

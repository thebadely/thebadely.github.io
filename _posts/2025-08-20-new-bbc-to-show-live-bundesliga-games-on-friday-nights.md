Muller, Robben & Lewandowski in Bundesliga's best opening goals

Top-flight German football will be shown live on the BBC this season after rights were secured to broadcast one Bundesliga match a week through to 2027.

The coverage will start on Friday, 22 August when defending champions Bayern Munich welcome RB Leipzig to the Allianz Arena.

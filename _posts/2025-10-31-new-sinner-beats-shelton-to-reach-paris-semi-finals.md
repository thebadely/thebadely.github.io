Let's dive into the details: Jannik Sinner has reached all four Grand Slam finals this year, winning two and losing the other two to Carlos Alcaraz 

Jannik Sinner moved a step closer to regaining the world number one status with victory over Ben Shelton at the Paris Masters.

Carlos Alcaraz's shock second-round defeat to Cameron Norrie means the Italian can overtake the Spaniard by winning the the ATP Masters 1,000 event in the French capital.

Sinner reached the Paris semi-finals for the first time after beating Shelton 6-3 6-3 - his seventh straight win over the American.

The 24-year-old will face third seed Alexander Zverev after the defending champion survived two match points to beat Daniil Medvedev in a three-set thriller.

"I'm very happy," Sinner told Sky Sports. "It was a very, very tough match.

"At times you don't have a lot of control because of his incredible serving, but today I felt like I was returning very well. Also, from the back of the court I played very solid and very aggressive."

Sinner dropped serve in the middle of the second set, but soon re-established his advantage to wrap up victory over Shelton, 23, inside 70 minutes.

"At the moment I'm not thinking about the ranking," added the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion. "It's a consequence of how I'm playing.

"Making the semis here in Paris means a lot. It has been a very long season with some great, great results and I never take these results for granted."

Sinner will face Zverev in the last four after the German fought back to beat Medvedev 2-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5).

Alexander Bublik will appear in a Masters semi-final for the first time after winning 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 7-5 against Australian sixth seed Alex de Minaur, sparking emotional scenes for Kazakhstan's number one.

The 13th seed will next face Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime, with the ninth seed having ended the run of Shanghai Masters champion Valentin Vacherot with a 6-2 6-2 success.

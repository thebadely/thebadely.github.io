It has been recently reported that Fantasy Premier League (FPL) will soon be back for the 2025-26 season and includes some updated features.

As well as price alterations and plenty of new arrivals into the league, there have also been announcements of new ways to score points and extra chips to apply to your team throughout the campaign.

Here is a look at everything we know so far about the latest version of the game.

Mohamed Salah was the top scoring player in Fantasy Premier League during the 2024-25 season

A big change for the upcoming season is that players are now allowed two uses of all four chips throughout a season.

These are: bench boost, free hit, triple captain and wildcard. Players will now be permitted one use of each chip in the first half of the season and another in the second lot of 19 matches.

Bench boost is where the points of all four of a team's substitutes count towards a total score in that game week.

Free hits allow players to temporarily change as many players as they wish in a single game week, but their team will be reset to how it was in the following week.

Triple captain is where a team's captain's score is tripled instead of doubled for a single game week.

A wildcard allows a player to make unlimited permanent transfers to their team in a single game week.

However, unlike last year, the assistant manager chip will no longer be available to players.

All four chips will be available to use twice for the 2025-26 FPL season

Outfield players will now earn bonus points based on the number of defensive actions they make in one match.

For defenders, clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles all count as defensive involvements.

For midfielders and forwards, clearances, blocks, interceptions, tackles, ball recoveries are classified as such.

For every 10 defensive actions, a defensive player makes in a single match, they will receive two bonus points. For midfielders and forwards, two points are awarded for every 12 actions made.

Had this have been in play for the 2024-25 season, Everton's James Tarkowski would have been the top-scoring player for defensive involvements. He would have earned 44 bonus points, four more than any other player.

Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo would have been the best-performing midfielder in this metric with 42 bonus points, six more than any other player.

As per previous years, BBC Sport will be running its own dedicated FPL league for our readers to join and compete against each other.

Details of how to join will be announced once the game is fully launched.

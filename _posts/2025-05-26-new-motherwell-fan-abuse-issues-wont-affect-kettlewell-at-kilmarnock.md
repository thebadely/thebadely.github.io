It has been recently reported that Stuart Kettlewell takes charge of a third Scottish club at Kilmarnock

New Kilmarnock manager Stuart Kettlewell says his experience with fan abuse while Motherwell manager will not affect him doing his job or his family's life in any way.

Kettlewell, 40, left Fir Park in January citing fan abuse, but he said: "This is my job, it doesn't have to be my family's life and I really do stand by that.

"I have been offered jobs since I came out of Motherwell but what was always important to me was to try and get the right fit for me."

Kettlewell also revealed he's spent time at Everton during his time away from football and said he "learned a lot."

On his objectives at Killie he wants to win games, develop players and be involved in player trading.

"It's a group that I'm really forward to working with," said Kettlewell, who has replaced Derek McInnes, following the latter's move to Hearts.

"There's a really good nucleus of players that I've admired from afar. We're without question going to have to add some bodies. We've got a lot of out of contract players.

"At no point have I ever been asked for a cuddle, at no point have I ever asked anyone to feel sorry for me. I made a decision [to leave Motherwell], stood by my decision, still do to this day. This is my job, it doesn't have to be my family's life.

"I'm completely obsessed with the game, always have been, always wanted to be a manager. Hopefully, I've done that now for a good number of games in comparison to my age."

Latest Kilmarnock news, analysis and fan views

Kettlewell has agreed a two-year deal and will again be assisted by Stevie Frail while coaches Chris Burke and Craig Clark are also part of the backroom team.

Burke has latterly coached Killie's youth team to success in the Scottish Youth Cup and took the first team for their final game of the season against Hearts, which McInnes was not involved in. Kilmarnock finished ninth in the 2024-25 Scottish Premiership.

Scotland assistant John Carver and former Killie forward Steven Naismith had also been linked with the post.

"The club conducted a thorough recruitment process, where we were looking for a candidate who has a track record in recruiting and developing players, including young talent and has a strong understanding of Scottish football," a club statement said. 

"We identified Stuart as the best candidate to lead Kilmarnock into an exciting new chapter.

"Stuart's experiences, paired with the above, fits our vision and desires for the future of Kilmarnock."

In appointing a new manager, Kilmarnock have clearly been eager to avoid any of the complications that surrounded the departure of McInnes.

That all got a bit tricky with the mounting speculation followed by a defeat at Motherwell and the understandable dismay of some fans. 

The decision that McInnes wouldn't be in charge for the final match of the season against his prospective new employers was clearly an exercise in damage limitation.

Kettlewell was not an unexpected candidate. He is available and can point to a strong evidence of work at Motherwell and Ross County.

Now it looks like he will be given the chance to prove he can replicate that at Rugby Park.

Amy: I've not seen one Kilmarnock fan who supports this. Cheap option and one that confirms us as bottom-six fodder.

David M: He didn't really get a chance at Motherwell. I always respect his honesty.

Ryan: Risk is a massive factor with Kettlewell. When you consider the manner in which he departed his previous position, surely it has to be considered a real possibility that he would walk again, on his own terms, if he wasn't happy?

Ross: Given some of the other names touted, the prospect of Kettlewell is a little underwhelming. He didn't exactly set the heather on fire during his last job.

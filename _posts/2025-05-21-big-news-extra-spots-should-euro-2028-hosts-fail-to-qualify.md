It has been recently reported that Euro 2028 will be played in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland

Uefa says joint-hosts England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland will have to qualify for Euro 2028 - but two places will be reserved at the finals should any of those host nations fail to qualify.

Nine venues across the four countries will stage the 24-team tournament.

Northern Ireland was originally due to, but has since pulled out after Belfast's Casement Park was removed as an option due to funding.

Unlike previous Euros where hosts have been granted automatic qualification, Uefa has had to alter its protocols.

There will be 12 qualifying groups, with the group winners and eight best-placed runners-up reaching the finals.

The four host nations will each be in separate qualifying groups, with two spots allocated to the highest-ranked of those sides who don't make it.

The remaining places will be decided by play-offs between the remaining runners-up and the best-ranked 2026-27 Nations League non-qualified group winners.

The composition of those play-offs will depend on the number of spots needed for the host nations. 

If two are used, eight teams will compete in two pathways for the final two spots, with single leg semi-finals and finals.

If one is used then 12 countries will compete in three pathways for the three remaining spots, with single leg semi-finals and finals.

If none of the four places are used by host nations then eight teams will contest four home-and-away play-offs, with the winners going through.

Six stadiums in England - Wembley, Etihad Stadium, Anfield, Villa Park, Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium and St James' Park in Newcastle - will host games in 2028.

Dublin's Aviva Stadium, Hampden Park in Glasgow and the Principality Stadium in Cardiff make up the list.

The qualification schedule is expected to be finalised in autumn 2025.

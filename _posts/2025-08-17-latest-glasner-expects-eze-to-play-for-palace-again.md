Experts revealed that Eberechi Eze has two years left on his Crystal Palace contract

Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner expects Eberechi Eze to feature in the club's first European fixture, despite being in talks over a move to Tottenham.

After the goalless draw against Chelsea, Glasner told Sky Sports: "There are a lot of rumours about Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi, but they were 100% with this group... and they have proved that in a big way."

On the future of Eze, Glasner added: "He will come tomorrow to the Crystal Palace training ground, Tuesday off, we take Wednesday and I expect him to be back playing for us against Fredrikstad."

Palace will face Norwegian side Fredrikstad in the Conference League play-off round on Thursday (20:00 BST kick-off).

The Eagles qualified for Europe for the first time in history by winning last season's FA Cup, but were demoted from the Europa League over Uefa's multi-club ownership rules.

If Eze or Guehi play in Palace's Conference League qualifier, they would still be able to feature for another team in the league phase of European competition this season according to Uefa's rules.

Glasner also spoke to BBC Match of the Day about the duo: "Everyone could see the performances against Liverpool [in the Community Shield] and today they were 100% aligned with this team and Crystal Palace.

"As long as they are 100% committed, they will play as they are so good."

On Saturday, BBC Sport reported that Tottenham were accelerating their move to sign 27-year-old Eze, having been in discussions over a transfer since the start of the week.

The England forward has an expired release clause in his contract which was worth an initial Â£60m, plus a further Â£8m in add-ons.

It is understood Tottenham are negotiating an offer slightly below the total release figure.

And it is a similar story with England centre-back Guehi, with talks ongoing between Palace and Premier League champions Liverpool.

Speaking last week, Eagles chairman Steve Parish said the club would sell their captain this summer to avoid losing him on a free at the end of his contract.

Palace are believed to want about Â£40m for the 25-year-old, but Liverpool want to pay less than that figure.

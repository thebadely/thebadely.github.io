Here’s what you need to know: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is to launch a "gap year" scheme to give school and college leavers a taste of the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, but without making a long-term commitment.

The paid 12-month course is aimed at under-25s and is part of efforts to help solve long-term recruitment and retention problems in the armed forces.

Applications open in spring 2026 to be part of the first cohort of 150 recruits, with ministers planning for the scheme to eventually grow to 1,000 young people a year.

The programme is paid but officials have yet to announce a salary.

The MoD says those who join the "gap year" programme will learn skills of leadership, teamwork and problem solving to set them up "for life" whether they pursue a career in the armed forces or not.

Officials hope the scheme will bring a broader range of people into the forces, and that some decide to stay to pursue a career in the military.

Defence Secretary John Healey MP said: "This is a new era for Defence, and that means opening up new opportunities for young people to experience and learn from our Armed Forces.

"This gap year scheme will give Britain's young people a taste of the incredible skills and training on offer across the Army, Royal Navy and RAF. It's part of our determination to reconnect society with our forces, and drive a whole of society approach to our nation's defence.

"As families come together at this time of year, and young people think about their futures, I want the outstanding opportunities on offer in our Armed Forces to be part of that conversation in homes across the UK."

Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said: "As ever with Labour, the reality does not match the spin. A scheme involving just 150 participants is barely a pilot, let alone the 'whole of society' response they claim to be delivering.

"Of course, the Australian scheme has its strengths but these tiny numbers do nothing for our war readiness, and expose the harsh reality that Labour is prioritising higher welfare spending over a proper increase in the defence budget. Meanwhile, their Defence Investment Plan is months behind schedule, and we still have no idea when, or how, they intend to reach 3% of GDP on defence.

"In contrast, the Conservatives are serious about defending our country, which is why we announced the Sovereign Defence Fund, to raise an additional £50bn for defence and strengthen our deterrence by giving our Armed Forces the modern capabilities they need."

The "gap year" scheme was recommended by the UK Strategic Defence Review in June after being inspired by the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

The ADF gap year programme has been in operation for more than a decade, with applicants offered the chance "get a feel for military life while enjoying unique experiences you can't find anywhere else".

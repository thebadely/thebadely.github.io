Let's dive into the details: Emma Sing's Gloucester-Hartpury have won eight straight matches with a bonus point

Champions Gloucester-Hartpury continued their perfect start to the Premiership Women's Rugby season with a 45-26 victory over Loughborough Lightning.

With the season returning after a six-week winter break, Gloucester-Hartpury made it eight straight wins and have now beaten all of their rivals this season at the first time of asking.

A Nel Metcalfe hat-trick helped put them 19-7 ahead at the break on Sunday and they extended their advantage in the second half with Kelsey Jones, Georgia Brock, England captain Zoe Stratford and Pip Hendy all crossing.

The victory leaves them five points clear of nearest rivals Saracens.

Elsewhere, Bristol Bears ended a five-game losing run with a dramatic 30-29 home win over Sale Sharks.

Sale led 22-10 at half-time but Bristol gradually cut the gap and a last-gasp penalty from Wales scrum-half Keira Bevan gave them the victory.

Fourth-placed Exeter Chiefs ran in six tries in a 36-0 win over bottom side Leicester Tigers, while Harlequins are third after beating Trailfinders on Friday.

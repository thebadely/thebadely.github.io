Let's dive into the details: Some families in Oxfordshire are not able to afford basic toiletries despite working full-time jobs, a charity leader has warned.

Community organisation Jungle, based in Oxford, gives monthly provisions of hygiene essentials like toilet paper and sanitary towels to people struggling with costs.

That includes three families working full-time at a school. 

The project was recently funded to the end of 2025 with a £1,000 donation from Templars Square shopping centre, where the charity is based.

"One of our team members works part time at a local school and that is where this began, because she ran into a lot of families who needed help," said Jungle supervisor Beverly Visser.

"In fact three of the bags go to employees of the school. Even though they have a full-time job they still struggle to make ends meet."

Jungle provides the hygiene bundles, nicknamed jungle boxes, to around 25 individuals and families who have been referred.

They include victims of modern slavery and patients from a local health centre.

The boxes include sanitary towels, nappies, toilet paper, deodorant and washing up liquid and cost around £25 each.

"I can tell that the people who come are so grateful and I can tell that they're struggling," Beverly said.

"They come regularly and I know that they need it."

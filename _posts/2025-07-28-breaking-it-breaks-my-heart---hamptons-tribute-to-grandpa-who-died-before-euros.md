Experts revealed that Hannah Hampton was named Player of the Match in the Euro 2025 final

England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has paid tribute to her grandfather who died two days before the team's triumphant Euro 2025 campaign.

The 24-year-old was a rock for the Lionesses throughout the tournament and proved her worth once again in Sunday's final against world champions Spain.

Having made a string of crucial interventions in the game, Hampton saved two penalties in the shootout to help her side retain the title they won in 2022.

It was the first time an England team had won a major trophy on foreign soil and further cemented their place as one of the top nations in world football.

In the aftermath of a historic night, Hampton posted a heartfelt message alongside an image of a goalkeeper's shirt with the word 'grandpa' printed on the inside of the collar.

"Two days before the biggest tournament of my life, you left," she wrote on Instagram.

"You taught me so much, not just about football, but about life. About staying grounded, working hard, being resilient and doing things the right way.

"It breaks my heart that you didn't get to see me walk out for our country at my first major tournament... something you dreamed of for me, something we talked about so many times. But I know, deep down, you were still there. I felt you with me. In the tunnel. On the pitch. In the tough moments. I heard you in my head when I needed strength.

"I hope I made you proud, Grandpa. I carried you through every minute. And I always will. I did it. WE DID IT."

Hannah Hampton made her England debut in 2022

Hampton's route to the top has been littered with obstacles.

The Chelsea goalkeeper was born with a serious eye condition and told by doctors she should not play football.

Hampton has undergone multiple operations to correct her vision but it is still not perfect and she continues to have depth perception issues.

After defying the odds to get into the professional game, her international career hit a rocky patch after England won Euro 2022 on home soil.

Hampton served as back-up to Mary Earps, but was dropped in the aftermath with reports suggesting it was due to her behaviour.

Boss Sarina Wiegman brought her back into the fold in March 2023, having said Hampton had "sorted out personal issues".

But Earps remained the No1 and Hampton was once again left without any game time after being named in the squad for the 2024 World Cup. 

A move to Chelsea in 2023 helped get her career back on track and she won the domestic treble with her club last season to show she can deliver in big moments.

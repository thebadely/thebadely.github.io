According to new developments, Georgia Stanway is a two-time European champion with England

The Womenâs Super League transfer window opens on Friday - so what deals could happen?

Clubs are shopping around to add players to their squads who can help them end the season on a high.

Manchester City are looking to end Chelseaâs six-year stranglehold on the title, Manchester United are competing in the knockout stages of the Womenâs Champions League for the first time and Liverpool are still seeking their first victory in the WSL this season. 

With two managerial changes confirmed in December and a number of high-profile names out of contract this summer, it could be a busy January. 

Some of the biggest deals completed this month could be contract renewals for a number of big-name players.

England's Georgia Stanway, 26, has attracted lots of attention, with Arsenal among those to have held talks with the midfielder. Her deal at Bayern Munich ends in the summer, and while she has an offer to extend, she could sign a pre-contract agreement in January to join another club in the summer.

Another England midfielder, Ella Toone, is out of contract at Manchester United in July. She can begin talks with other clubs outside the WSL this month.

Manchester City top scorer Khadija Shaw, 28, has had positive discussions over a contract extension, which is a huge priority for the club.

European champions Arsenal want to keep US international Emily Fox and she joins Katie McCabe, Kim Little and Stina Blackstenius in having a deal that expires this summer.

Chelsea are also due to hold negotiations with just six months remaining on the contracts of senior players Sam Kerr, Millie Bright and Lucy Bronze.

Aston Villa captain Rachel Daly is also out of contract in the summer, but will the club offer a new deal to the 34-year-old?

Elsewhere, Everton forward Kelly Gago, 27 on 5 January, has reportedly attracted interest from Paris St-Germain but with a valuation of Â£500,000, can the Toffees keep hold of her?

All eyes will be on US striker Trinity Rodman, who could be on the move from Washington Spirit depending on the outcome of salary negotiations with the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

Chelsea are among those tracking Rodman's situation, while Japan midfielder Maika Hamano could leave the Blues to join Tottenham on loan. US forward Catarina Macario also has interest from the NWSL, while Germany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken could seek more game time elsewhere. 

Reports suggest West Ham might have to fend off interest in England defender Anouk Denton, while Amber Tysiak previously attracted suitors in the summer. 

Renee Slegers won the Women's Champions League with Arsenal in May

Arsenal's biggest decision is whether they extend manager Renee Slegers' contract with it expiring this summer. They also need a goalkeeper and have been pursuing Hammarby full-back Smilla Holmberg.

Aston Villa are hoping to bring in a Japan international but might be quiet having done good business in the summer. 

But Brighton are hoping to be active as they hunt for a replacement for injured England forward Michelle Agyemang and more options in midfield. 

Meanwhile, Chelsea are always willing to spend big and as well as Rodman, they will have their eyes on attacking options. They could add depth in defence too. 

Everton were very busy in the summer but the owners have shown they are happy to spend if they want to add to the squad so they are likely to be on the lookout for additions.

Leicester Cityâs target has been made clear by manager Rick Passmoor and that is to bring in experienced WSL players. Centre-back is a priority position and they are looking at full-backs. 

Elsewhere at Liverpool, they are expected to be very active in order to move off the bottom of the table. With money available from their Â£1m sale of Olivia Smith in the summer, Gareth Taylor will be looking to bring in a list of players to bulk out a thin squad. A full-back is already on the cards, while they have been linked to winger Alice Bergstrom from BK Hacken. 

It will be interesting to see how active London City Lionesses are. They sacked manager Jocelyn Precheur last month but are backed by wealthy businesswoman Michele Kang, who is not afraid to spend big. They are targeting the best young players.

Manchester Cityâs most important business will be to agree a renewal of Shawâs contract but they might also add a few players to help them get over the line in their title challenge. 

Rivals Manchester United have been busy with two signings already confirmed and they are looking to add more. A central midfielder has been a target for a while, as reported by BBC Sport last month. They are tracking the situations of several big-name players in that position. 

Tottenham have also had a strong start to the window with three additions confirmed. They hope to bring in Hamano on loan from Chelsea too. 

West Hamâs new manager Rita Guarino will want to bring in some new signings and may look to Italy, where she has experience in the market and vast contacts.

Which players could be on the move this window?

It has been a busy start to the window for Manchester United, who have already secured two signings with Germany forward Lea Schuller and Sweden full-back Hanna Lundkvist arriving.

Japan midfielder Hinata Miyazawa signed a new long-term deal, keeping her at United until 2029.

Manchester City have also agreed new contracts with captain Alex Greenwood, full-back Kerstin Casparij and centre-back Rebecca Knaak.

Meanwhile, Tottenham announced in November they have signed Norway midfielder Signe Gaupset from SK Brann. They have also added full-back Hanna Wijk and Matilda Nilden from BK Hacken. 

Sweden youth international Nilden, 21, has agreed a long-term contract and will wear the number 14 shirt for Spurs.

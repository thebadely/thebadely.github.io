According to new developments, Two men have been killed and two others are in hospital after four people were stabbed at a business in south London.

The Met Police said officers were called at 13:00 BST "to reports that multiple people had been assaulted at a business premises in Long Lane, SE1".

Four people were treated for stab wounds by paramedics. A 58-year-old-man died at the scene, while a 27-year-old man later died in hospital. Two others were taken to hospital, one of whom is in a life-threatening condition, police said.

The man in a life-threatening condition, who is in his 30s, has been detained in connection with the stabbings. Police said they do not believe the incident was terrorism-related.

The other man injured in the attack, who is aged in his 30s, remains in hospital and his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing.

A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said it sent ambulance crews, advanced paramedics, incident response officers, a command support vehicle and paramedics from its tactical response unit to the scene.

They added: "We treated four people at the scene. We took three patients to major trauma centres as a priority. 

"Very sadly, despite the best efforts of our crews, a person was pronounced dead at the scene."

Det Ch Supt Emma Bond, who leads policing for the area, said: "Our investigation is in the early stages and we are working hard to understand the full circumstances of this shocking incident.

"At this point, we do not believe it to be terrorism-related and there is no further risk to the public.

"There will be a heavy police presence in the area throughout today and I would encourage anyone with information to speak with officers or contact the Met by other means."

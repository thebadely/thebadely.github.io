Experts revealed that Leigh Leopards take on Wakefield Trinity and Leeds Rhinos face St Helens with all four battling to face one of Hull KR or Wigan Warriors in the Super League play-off semi-final stage

The regular season is over. The curtain is soon to be drawn on another Super League campaign before a historic Ashes Test series.

Leigh Leopards begin this year's play-off series with a thrilling eliminator against a mightily impressive Wakefield Trinity on Friday (20:00 BST).

Just 24 hours later, Leeds Rhinos take on St Helens (20:00 BST) in what is sure to be a vociferous Headingley contest, with all four sides battling it out for the right to face one of league leaders and Challenge Cup winners Hull KR or last season's quadruple winners Wigan.

But how do the four respective head coaches rate their chances and assess their seasons so far?

When Leigh Leopards face Wakefield Trinity in the first of this year's Super League play-off fixtures, it will cap off the immense amount of work both teams have done in the past few seasons to boost their fortunes.

For Leigh boss Adrian Lam, he is pleased that the two sides will meet, having historically not challenged for major honours until recently.

"It's been great that they've made the six. I've congratulated Daryl [Powell]. I love it when there's different things in Super League such as Leigh being third and Wakefield being sixth and Hull KR winning the minor Premiership. I think that's great for rugby league and this country," he told BBC Radio Manchester.

"They've done a really good job to force their way into that six spot and it's off the back of some hard work this year."

Much like Leigh, Wakefield have gone from strength to strength on their return to Super League.

Compare and contrast their sixth-placed finish this term with a total of 15 wins and 30 points to that of their most recent bow in the top flight in 2023 which resulted in just four wins, eight points and a bitter drop into the Championship.

They travel to Leigh knowing that they are just two games from a Grand Final - some contrast to the perilous state they were in just two years ago - and Powell sees no reason why his side cannot cause an upset on Friday and beyond.

"I see an opportunity for us to go and do something special. You never say never in sport. You look around and there's been unbelievable things done over the years," Powell told BBC Radio Leeds.

"I recognise it will be a tough challenge for us but I do think the experience of playing a play-off game, the feel of it, the intensity of the environment, everything that it stands for is another tick in the box of where we're going."

Wakefield's impressive season means they have qualified for the Super League play-offs for the first time since 2012 and whatever happens, Powell thinks they have set up for the long term thanks to their efforts.

"If we don't get done what we want to this year, it puts us in that ballpark of understanding what it's about for next year," he added.

"Whichever way it falls it feels like it's been like a pretty special season for us. How special? Well we'll decide that over the next few weeks."

It's a sentiment matched by Powell's opposite number with Lam also optimistic his side could cause an upset of their own.

"It's not out of the question we could make the Grand Final. We've got a lot of hard work still left to do," Lam added.

"To think that we've improved from where we are to this point in our third season back in Super League has been an incredible journey."

St Helens hold off Leeds in close contest

Leeds missed out on a play-off spot last term but returned to the top six and a home eliminator tie against St Helens courtesy of their first top-four finish since 2017.

Their most recent meeting at Headingley with St Helens resulted in a narrow 6-0 defeat and Rhinos boss Brad Arthur is expecting another physical encounter this weekend as knockout rugby begins.

"It's been tough [against St Helens] every game. They've probably owned a few more moments than us at crucial times," Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds.

"The games have probably been, for both coaches, a bit scrappy. But it just shows you how physical the nature is and how much both teams put into it.

"We're expecting nothing different. Both coaches will be feeling the same. If we can be a bit more clinical then maybe that might be the difference because both teams are very good physically."

Arthur said that his demands of his side were not quite met this season and that he believes his side can do better. 

"I expected us to be better than what we were [this season]. Where that took us wasn't completely short but I would have been really disappointed if we weren't playing in the play-offs," he added.

"If you'd have said to me at the beginning of the year that we'd finish fourth and get a home eliminator, I would have ripped your arm off and taken that opportunity."

Morgan Knowles made his debut for St Helens in 2015

Paul Wellens' St Helens team have taken on Leeds four times already this season, coming out on the winning side on three occasions, so he is familiar with their opponents for Saturday's eliminator.

"Throughout the competition some teams perform differently from other teams. But one thing we always have with Leeds is an unbelievably hard and tough game," Wellens told BBC Sport.

"They're a physical team and they play the game with an intensity. They've got real speed, mobility and aggression. All of those things and attributes that help teams be successful.

"We're under no illusions of the challenge that awaits us this weekend."

Should Saints be knocked out of the play-offs on Saturday, it would bring down the curtain on Morgan Knowles' career with the club.

The 28-year-old has made over 200 appearances for the club and has won multiple honours including four Super League titles, but he will depart at the end of 2025 in order to join NRL side the Dolphins where he will link up with former Saints boss Kristian Woolf.

"There's a number of reasons for us to be motivated around finishing 2025 in the right way and Morgan Knowles finishing his time at the club is one of those," Wellens continued.

"We'd love him to step on the plane and go to the NRL with another Super League Grand Final winner's ring."

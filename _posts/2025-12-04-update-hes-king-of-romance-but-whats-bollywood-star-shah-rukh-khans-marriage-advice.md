Experts revealed that Megastar Shah Rukh Khan is often described as Bollywood’s King of Romance.

So having recently got married, I can’t help but ask him when we meet in central London - what’s his advice for newlyweds?

Before Khan could answer, fellow actor Kajol jumped in.

"All his films he's done are about before marriage, not after marriage," she laughed.

"Till now, you were a candidate I could've given advice to. After marriage, you're on your own," Khan agreed.

But the superstar, who was in the UK for the unveiling of a new statue of him and Kajol in Leicester Square, did still offer some pearls of wisdom.

“Till then, I think I got it right. You must have romance, you must sing songs,” he said.

“And you must have watched DDLJ,” added Kajol.

DDLJ - or Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge - is the longest-running film in Indian cinema, and stars both actors.

The new statue, which was revealed on Thursday amid monsoon-like conditions, is commemorating 30 years since it first came out.

Khan, a household name in India, is one of the country's most popular stars with millions of fans domestically and abroad.

Charming and funny, the actor is often described as Bollywood's "most important cultural export", with millions of fans who also endearingly refer to him as King Khan or the King of Bollywood.

Fans queued up to try to catch a glimpse of him and Kajol at the statue unveiling, with many screaming and taking photos as they arrived.

Speaking afterwards to BBC News, Khan said the statue was like having “a life-size doll”.

"I think I'm looking very handsome. You're also looking very pretty," he told Kajol.

"It's like a second thought, but thanks," she responded, with a laugh.

The film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, often dubbed the Romeo and Juliet of Bollywood cinema, follows Raj and Simran's love story across Europe and India, beginning on a train from King's Cross station.

Some of the scenes are shot in London, and in Leicester Square itself.

The new monument joins sculptures of Harry Potter, Paddington and Bridget Jones as part of Leicester Square's Scenes in the Square trail.

Khan said it was "very befitting" to have the statue unveiled in London, because of the appeal of Bollywood films there.

"England's audience has been very responsible for Indian cinema's takeoff globally in modern times," he said.

The 60-year-old said he was "dying to show" it to his three children.

Co-star Kajol, also a renowned actor, added it feels "amazing" and "a little unbelievable" to be commemorated in this way.

Bollywood, India's dominant film business, produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.

But like others across the world, it has seen ups and downs since the pandemic shuttered cinemas for months and led many to turn to streaming services. It is yet to return to its former glory.

When asked about the slowdown, Kajol said she thought it was to do with the fact there is much more competition for viewers nowadays.

"People suddenly have a choice of whether they want to go to the cinema or not. And if you have so much choice, it automatically makes it more difficult when you have to choose," she told BBC News.

"But I think community viewing... will always exist," Khan added. "We like to see things, enjoy things together."

Khan has spent more than three decades in the Hindi film industry and reinvented himself from being an actor to running a major production house and owning a cricket team.

The Bollywood superstar recently joined the billionaire club for the first time, becoming one of the world's richest actors, according to a new list.

This puts him in the league of global celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, pop star Rihanna, golfer Tiger Woods, and singer Taylor Swift.

In 2023, he made a return to movies after a hiatus lasting four years, and has recently teased his new upcoming action film, King.

But when asked if more action films lie ahead - maybe even a stint as the next James Bond - Khan replied:  "No. I don't have the accent. And I don't like shaken martinis."

Leicester Square's Scenes in the Square trail is run by Heart of London Business Alliance, supported by Westminster City Council.

Last month, a statue of Bridget Jones was added to the display.

Akshaye Widhani, CEO of Yash Raj Films which produced Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, said it was "a huge moment of pride" to see the film being honoured in the UK.

"To be recognised alongside Hollywood icons like Mary Poppins, Gene Kelly and Harry Potter, shows the cultural impact DDLJ has had the world over."

Ros Morgan, chief executive at Heart of London Business Alliance, added: "We're proud to welcome global megastars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol to our Scenes in the Square trail.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a cinematic phenomenon that has shaped generations, and London's first tribute to Indian cinema honours a story whose magic continues to captivate audiences worldwide."

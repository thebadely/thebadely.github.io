Experts revealed that All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said.

Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old.

While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. 

Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities.

Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said.

Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. 

A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.

Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.

Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was "the cause of the problem", as well as "whether it complies with regulations".

Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. 

Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte."

The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire.

She said in a video message: "We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light."

Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims.

Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the "young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values".

Highlights: Rangers 3-0 Viktoria Plzen

Brian Laudrup's name was not one many would have expected to be evoked when discussing Rangers' wide men in the 3-0 thumping of Viktoria Plzen. 

Former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson did admit it was ridiculously premature to suggest Djeidi Gassama or Oliver Antman could ever make the sort of impact the iconic Dane did at Ibrox. 

But the comparison served to underline the impression the dynamic wingers had made on him and the Rangers fans as they ripped the Czech side to shreds in this Champions League third qualifying round first leg.

Gassama has exploded onto the scene since signing from Sheffield Wednesday. 

His two fabulous goals, one in each leg, helped drag Rangers through a treacherous assignment against Panathinaikos and over the first hurdle on the road to the Champions League.

With Antman on the other flank offering similar pace, footwork and eye for goal just one day after joining the club, Rangers looked a team that had found a new gear.

"I can't remember the last time Rangers had two electric wingers on the pitch at the same time," said former Ibrox midfielder Andy Halliday on Sportscene. "For such a long period of time, it's been such a problem for Rangers."

Gassama heads in third for Rangers against Plzen

Antman left his prints all over the game on his Rangers debut.

The Finnish winger - signed from Go Ahead Eagles, where he scored six goals and provided 15 assists in 32 games last term - was unlucky not to score when he saw a goal-bound effort blocked on the line. 

He was brought down in the box after a surging run that resulted in the penalty that was tucked away by Cyriel Dessers. 

His cross was measured to perfection for Gassama to knock inthe third goal to give Rangers daylight in the tie.

"I think you can see why we wanted to sign him," said Rangers head coach Russell Martin of the 23-year-old, who has agreed a four-year deal. 

"He's game, he's willing, he's really competitive and he has moments of real quality."

Gassama's performance also drew praise from the head coach.

The Mauritania-born 21-year-old has now scored four goals in as many games since joining from Sheffield Wednesday in July - 50% of what he delivered in 47 matches last term.

Three of those goals have come in the Champions League, making them even more valuable to the Ibrox club given the potential riches on offer.

"We spoke about the need for some winger-to-winger goals and Gassama is really stepping up in terms of intensity, he really wants to score," Martin added.

"We showed him a lot of clips when we signed him where he ends up too far away from goal. He's taken on the information really, really well."

Antman 'had a bit of everything' - Sportscene analysis

Former Rangers winger Peter Lovenkrands:

"Antman has shown fantastic promise. He's looking very, very exciting and he has a bundle of pace. And I love how Gassama attacks the back post. 

"I love watching two wingers running in behind and they can make a fantastic partnership. It will definitely get fans out of their seats."

Former Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday:

"I was so impressed with Antman. He had everything. His work rate was excellent and he did a great job.

"You can already see why he got so many assists last season. He doesn't just drive it into the box, he tries to pick players out.

"Gassama is direct, quick and great 1v1. He was a constant threat and caused defenders a lot of problems."

Former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson:

"The wingers gave Rangers an injection of pace in the final third was clearly missing against Motherwell. 

"Antman was sensational. He's very direct and lightning quick and I can't remember him giving the ball away. His decision making was spot on."

Former Rangers forward Steven Thompson:

"The penetration Antman has brought to this side has been absolutely brilliant. What an impact. They just look so much more dangerous."

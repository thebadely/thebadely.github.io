According to new developments, Raheem Sterling has won 82 caps for England

Just four years ago Raheem Sterling was widely regarded as England's best player in their run to the Euro 2020 final.

But the following season he was on the bench more for Manchester City and, despite winning his fourth Premier League title, was sold to Chelsea, the first marquee signing of their new owners.

This move hasn't worked out at all.

Now, aged 30, Sterling faces a season in exile at Chelsea, the Â£30m remaining in wages on his contract a key factor in the stalemate.

So what is going on?

Sterling signed a five-year Â£325,000-per-week contract in 2022, relocating his young family in the process.

The Â£50m transfer was a statement of intent by Todd Boehly, who at the time was acting as sporting director, and Clearlake Capital.

A problem for Sterling has been the people behind such a big deal are no longer in charge at the club.

In addition to Boehly's diminishing influence, Thomas Tuchel was the head coach who oversaw Sterling's arrival.

Then came Graham Potter, then Frank Lampard, and then Mauricio Pochettino, all within Sterling's first two seasons at the club, in which he played 81 times and scored 19 times as Chelsea finished 12th and then sixth.

But two years into his contract Chelsea effectively ended his role as a first-team player when new manager Enzo Maresca decided Sterling was not in his plans.

He has not played for the club since and spent last season on an underwhelming loan at Arsenal.

Unless the Blues and Sterling reach an agreement over a severance package for the Â£30m remaining on his contract, the earliest we are likely to see the England international play first-team football again is January.

The prospect of that scenario seems small.

There now appears to be a reluctance from the London club to pay Sterling up. He appears reluctant to give Chelsea an easy route out of their agreement.

Both stances are somewhat understandable.

In the immediate future, Sterling will remain with Chelsea's 'bomb squad' that now includes only Axel Disasi and David Datro Fofana.

Sterling is waiting for a clearer picture of how his future as a Chelsea exile looks after the international break.

Life in Chelsea's bomb squad is far from luxurious. With limited use of first-team facilities, it is a lonely existence.

The uncertainty and difficulties that have followed Sterling's career for 12 months show no sign of relenting.

Why has someone of Sterling's pedigree not found a new home?

The financial aspects are unquestionably a major factor.

But should it be down to Chelsea to find a new club - and the right financial package - to facilitate Sterling's exit, or is it his responsibility to forego what he is owed to prioritise playing first-team football?

The answer varies depending on who you speak to.

You could assume that Sterling looked to Chelsea to identify solutions to the problem.

Sources have indicated that the emphasis was on the club to present opportunities to Sterling given the clear intention to move him on during the transfer window.

It became increasingly clear Arsenal would not look to make the loan deal permanent last season given his lack of action under Mikel Arteta, so the predicament has not been sprung on Chelsea at the last minute.

If Sterling believes his future is not a priority for Chelsea, you would understand.

He would prefer to stay near London. His son Thiago is in Arsenal's academy and Sterling wants to avoid disrupting his family life again.

That is not to say Sterling did not enter the transfer window with an open mind. There was an understanding that he would consider any opportunity tabled by Chelsea as long as it worked for both parties.

It is believed those opportunities did not transpire.

From Chelsea's perspective, sources claim they brought Champions League sides Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus to the table. Although he was interested, Sterling's desire to remain close to his family took precedence.

Fulham, Crystal Palace and West Ham were among the London clubs sounded out, but those options never materialised.

Chelsea respect Sterling's position and are understanding of his reluctance to uproot his family for the second time three years.

But Chelsea felt his wages limited the options they could present to Sterling, particularly with regard to his preference to stay close to London.

It is important to stress, however, that wages - while a clear factor in this situation - are not the be all and end all for Sterling, who has turned down far more lucrative moves to the Saudi Pro League over the past 12 months.

Indeed, the rushed circumstances surrounding his Arsenal loan last season have acted as a cautionary tale.

He had little time to consider the move given it transpired all on deadline day.

From the perspective of regular playing time, it did not pan out how he would have hoped, and Sterling was keen for more thinking time before any potential move this summer.

Sources say he will continue to report to training and maintain his level of professionalism until a solution is found.

With the window closed, Sterling finds himself in the same spot and Chelsea continue to pay his wages.

In short, nobody wins.

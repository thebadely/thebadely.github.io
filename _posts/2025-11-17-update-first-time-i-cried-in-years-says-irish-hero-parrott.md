Experts revealed that Troy Parrott is the first player to score a hat-trick in an away game for the Republic of Ireland

Asked whether he would mark the goal that sparked the Republic of Ireland into fits of joyous celebration with a new tattoo, Troy Parrott replied: "No, I think when we get to the World Cup that's when I'll get one!"

It is ironic that Parrott has a penchant for tattoos - his injury time winner against Hungary on Sunday is a moment now permanently inked in the annuls of Irish football.

Ray Houghton's goal against Italy at World Cup 1994, Robbie Brady's winner - also against the Azzuri - at Euro 2016 and now Parrott in Budapest in November 2025.

The stuff of legend.

And less than 24 hours after that glorious night, Parrott is speaking exclusively to BBC Sport to somehow articulate the goal that will change his life forever.

"How many times I have watched it back? Probably about 500 times - every time I go on to my phone, it's there," Parrott explained.

"Even last night when I got to bed, I couldn't sleep imagining it over and over and over again.

"In general, I'm not really an emotional person, it's the first time I've cried in years. Look I can sit here and try to describe it, but it is the first time I've felt something like that.

"I've scored goals before but none as meaningful as my last one against Hungary. As a country we've had a lot of disappointing results and haven't given the fans a lot to cheer about, so this was tears of joy."

What unravelled in the Hungarian capital on Sunday night was the culmination of an unforgettable week for Parrott and the Republic of Ireland.

The 23-year-old's double in a 2-0 triumph against Portugal on Thursday night gave Heimir Hallgrimsson's side a fighting chance of qualifying for the World Cup through March's play-offs.

But to then score a hat-trick against the Hungarians is something Parrott cannot quite fathom.

"I think what happened against Portugal and then last night means this has to be written in some way," he said.

"We are all here for a reason, we all work very hard to be where we are.

"But you can lie in bed and imagine how you want scenarios to go and the last week I've had is something you cannot even imagine.

"For all this to happen so perfectly at that time of the game, it must be written. Everything aligned perfectly. It's a bit of good karma for us because as a team and a country we have had a lot of bad karma."

As you can imagine, Parrott has been the toast of Dublin for the past 24 hours.

Social media has been awash with clips of frenzied scenes of celebration back in Parrott's homeland.

Dublin Airport even renamed itself the Troy Parrott Airport on it's official X account.

"Yes, I saw the Dublin Airport thing - I'm loving all the stuff," said the AZ Alkmaar forward.

"It's crazy. I might be biased but the Irish support our own better than anyone. It's really a special thing. Beautiful.

"Just to see how happy it has made everyone - I was out today and fans are thanking me.

"I love where I come from, I love to be Irish. It's something I will have for the rest of my life.

"People are saying this is the best night they have ever had in their life, so to be able to contribute to that is something I will never forget.

"I know I'm not going to change, what goes on around me might but even to me I don't think I've had enough time for it to sink in. It's beautiful."

Having emerged through the ranks at Tottenham to become a player widely viewed as one of the most exciting in the British academy system, Parrott hasn't had everything his own way.

Following loans to Ipswich, Millwall, MK Dons and Preston, the striker joined AZ Alkmaar permanently in the summer of 2024.

"Part of the celebrations last night was that up to this point in my career it hasn't been so easy," Parrott explained.

"I've had to take risks in moving to different places. I've failed, got back up. Failed again and then got back up. Who is to say I'm not going to fail again?

"I feel the tough road I have had definitely played a part in last night. Moving to the Netherlands gave me a sense of being wanted, I felt appreciated and sometimes for a player that's all they need.

"I know playing in England didn't go so well and believe me I really beat myself about it at the time.

"So when it came to thinking about moving away, I thought: 'What is the worst that can happen?'

"And I really love it, I feel appreciated, I feel out of the spotlight which I never had for a few years."

Parrott may never be able to shun the spotlight again. Certainly not in the Republic of Ireland.

Polvara scores to bring Aberdeen to life

At the start of the week, rumours were swirling that Aberdeen midfielder Dante Polvara was a transfer target for Hibernian. Fans on social media were aghast.

By late Thursday, the American was the hero against 10-man FCSB in the Europa League, coming off the bench to spark a comeback from 2-0 down as Aberdeen drew 2-2 in their play-off first leg.

The midfielder is a fans' favourite at Pittodrie because of his warm personality, wholehearted displays and ability as a rounded midfielder.

Manager Jimmy Thelin has used him sparingly so far this season, Polvara appearing for a combined 45 minutes as a substitute in Aberdeen's three games before Thursday.

The American was introduced after 58 minutes against FCSB and played off the left, scoring a brilliant goal just three minutes later to revive Aberdeen's hopes.

The 25-year-old's performance helped cancel out the defensive mistakes which had undermined the Scottish Premiership side's display for an hour.

It was a striking cameo which lays down the gauntlet to Thelin to pick him from the start in Bucharest next week.

Aberdeen hit back to keep Europa League hopes alive

Scoring three minutes after coming on is a dream impact for any substitute, which is what the rangy Polvara did.

But it was not just the fact he scored but the quality of the goal itself which was so impressive. A cross was guided behind him by Adil Aouchiche, and he reacted brilliantly to get to the ball first.

His awareness and agility to swivel and hit it first time off his left foot was even better, with the ball kissing the inside of the post on its way in.

But Polvara did not stop there. Four minutes later, his pinpoint cross teed up Ester Sokler, whose header went narrowly wide.

At the death, Polvara's sheer presence caused havoc in the box and, but for a good save, he might have won it for Aberdeen.

Overall, the American managed two shots, both on target, and created three chances, the joint most of any player.

According to Opta, he completed all 19 of his passes and won six of his eight duels, the joint most among Aberdeen players. He was everywhere.

"Polvara down that left-hand side was such an out ball," Aberdeen legend Willie Miller said on BBC Scotland.

"He's a big strong unit. And the goal - he shouldn't be scoring from that position. Facing away from goal and he's able to manoeuvre himself to strike it.

"That fired the crowd up and gave them the hope and optimism they could get something out of it.

"He made a huge difference. The aerial threat, the energy, the quality. He must be in the manager's thoughts to start next week."

That is the key question. Polvara's time at Aberdeen has been constantly disrupted.

He was sent on loan to Charleston in his homeland a year after signing in 2022, and only on his return did then manager Barry Robson give him a chance.

Polvara repaid the faith in the 2023-24 season, scoring against both Eintracht Frankfurt and PAOK in the Conference League as he started to become more of a pivotal figure.

A hamstring tear last summer completely derailed his season as Thelin took charge, but even then he returned to make enough of an impact to help the team win the Scottish Cup.

He has been deployed as a centre-back, central midfielder and a winger in his time at Pittodrie - versatility which managers love but which often makes it difficult to nail down a particular spot.

With Thelin using a 4-2-3-1 system and preferring Sivert Heltne Nilsen and Ante Palaversa in the deeper roles and Aouchiche as the number 10 - along with traditional quick wingers out wide - Polvara starting would mean a change of tack from the Aberdeen boss.

Such was his impact on Thursday, though, Thelin may just be considering it, particularly as Polvara showed he appears to be over his fitness issues.

After those Hibs rumours surfaced, there were reports, external Polvara is set to be offered a new contract by Aberdeen, with his current deal up at the end of the season.

Starting more games would encourage the much-loved American to sign, as will more nights like Thursday at Pittodrie.

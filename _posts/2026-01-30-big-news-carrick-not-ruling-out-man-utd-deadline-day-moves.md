Let's dive into the details: Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick during the 3-2 win against Arsenal

Michael Carrick has not ruled out Manchester United adding to their squad before Monday's transfer deadline.

Former United head coach Ruben Amorim said last month he expected to bring someone in during the window.

However, the club's refusal to divert the Â£65m they had been willing to spend on long-term target Antoine Semenyo â who opted to join Manchester City from Bournemouth â was a source of frustration for the Portuguese.

United have been linked with a number of central midfield players, including former Wolves skipper Ruben Neves who now plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Hilal.

After Carrick confirmed left-sided utility man Patrick Dorgu would be out for "a number of weeks" through injury, there have been suggestions the club might look to cover the Denmark international's absence.

Interim head coach Carrick was coy when asked specifically about the club's position as he spoke in a news conference to preview Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham.

But he did leave the door open for business being done.

"Never say never," Carrick said. "A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.

"Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team."

Joshua Zirkzee remains at the centre of interest as it remains to be seen if he returns to Italy, with Juventus considering whether to make a move for the former Bologna forward who cost United Â£36.5m 18 months ago.

Zirkzee has recovered from a minor injury and is available for the Fulham game.

"Josh has just been trying to work to get fit," said Carrick. "It was great to have him training with the group the first time and I am just looking forward to working with him."

Carrick accepts the issue of Bruno Fernandes' future is "on the agenda a little bit", with the United captain due to assess his plans at the end of the season.

However, Carrick said that situation would be dealt with "further down the line".

'Another unbelievable result' - but what's different about Man Utd now?

Carrick has started his 17-match stint in charge until the end of the season in the best manner possible.

Victories against the Premier League's top two, Arsenal and Manchester City, have catapulted United into the top four for the first time this season.

However, sceptics argue they have beaten title contenders before and it is against the top flight's lesser lights that they tend to struggle.

Since late November, United have failed to beat Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves at Old Trafford in league games. Three of those sides are in the bottom eight, while Everton had a man sent off after 13 minutes.

Marco Silva's in-form Fulham had the better of a 1-1 draw against United at Craven Cottage in August.

Fulham have also taken 17 points from their past eight games, only one of which has ended in defeat, and they would close to just one point back from United if they were to win this weekend.

Little wonder Carrick is taking nothing for granted.

"Marco has made Fulham into a really good team," he said.

"Just because we are at home, taking anything for granted is bang out of order."

According to new developments, The 2025-26 Champions League is nearly upon us and this year there will be a record six Premier League clubs competing in Europe's elite contest.

There will, however, be no Scottish teams in the competition proper for the first time since 2021-22 after Celtic and Rangers were knocked out in the play-offs - it comes after Scotland lost its automatic spot having dropped out of the top 10 of Uefa's coefficient rankings.

The draw for the league phase will take place on Thursday, 28 August in Monaco at 17:00 BST.

This will be the second instalment of the new Champions League format, consisting of a 36-team league phase.

The first round of league phase games will begin on 16 September, with the final being hosted at the Puskas Arena, Budapest on 30 May 2026.

Paris St-Germain return as holders, having beaten Inter Milan 5-0 in last season's final to win the competition for the first time, while 15-time champions Real Madrid top Uefa's coefficient rankings for their record over the past five years.

But how will the Premier League sides fare? Make your predictions below.

A 'new era' of the Champions League - all you need to know

Arsenal come into the Champions League off the back of a promising season in Europe, reaching the semi-finals for the first time in 16 years.

They, alongside Liverpool and Aston Villa, fell to eventual champions PSG but Mikel Arteta's side showed a massive improvement on the European stage as they overcame reigning champions Real Madrid, beating them home and away with a dominant aggregate 5-1 scoreline.

Arsenal have bolstered their forward line heavily this summer, spending over Â£150m on Victor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke, after midfielder-turned-makeshift-striker Mikel Merino was forced to lead the line in all of the Gunners' knockout games last term.

The pressure is building on the club to finally deliver major silverware as their five-year wait for a trophy continues but Arteta will believe the added depth at his disposal can help his side get over the line in the Champions League for the first time ever.

Chelsea return to Europe's elite as Club World Cup and Conference League champions after a two-year absence.

The Blues' summer success in the CWC - a competition they qualified for because they won the Champions League in 2021- culminated with an impressive win against last season's European champions PSG.

They will come into this season's league phase looking to make up for lost time and have a track record of European success as they are the only club to have won all four major Uefa club competitions.

Enzo Maresca has added to his forward line this summer with the signings of Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens, with the hope of cementing Chelsea as a force domestically and in Europe.

Last season's Premier League champions will be eyeing European glory after being knocked out of the 2024-25 Champions League in the last-16 by PSG.

In Arne Slot's debut season with the Reds, he managed to cruise through the newly introduced league phase, finishing first out of the 36 sides.

However, it was not plain sailing for Slot and his side as they met the eventual winners PSG in the opening knockout game.

In the new format last season, 12th-placed Bayern Munich progressed further than the Reds, proving the unpredictable nature of the new Champions League.

What's changed this season? Well, Liverpool have added Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, Hugo Ekitike and Giovanni Leoni to their ranks as they look to claim their eighth European cup.

It was a fairly glum season for Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side last term - third in the Premier League, out of the Champions League in the knockout round play-offs against Real Madrid and no silverware to boast about.

City, who won the 2023 Champions League, look to have turned a page this season as they move forward without midfield maestro Kevin de Bruyne. 

Guardiola has bolstered his squad with the arrivals of Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders.

After last season's bumpy patch, progression to the last 16 would be a step in the right direction for City. With new recruits and Reijnders playing in the De Bruyne role, can City claim their second Champions League title? 

Uefa club coefficient ranking: 4th

Eddie Howe's side had their first taste of Champions League football in 20 years in the 2023-24 season and had some standout performances in the group stage. This included a famous 4-1 victory over a Kylian Mbappe-led PSG side at the cauldron which was St James' Park.

Their summer business has not reflected their returning status as a Champions League club, however, with rejections from multiple striker targets including eventual Liverpool and Chelsea signings Hugo Ekitike and Joao Pedro respectively.

There is also the long-running saga with star striker Alexander Isak, who, after looking destined to stay at Tyneside when the Magpies secured a top-five place in May, is pushing for a move to Liverpool.

Overall, Newcastle are not best placed for their return to Champions League football but no team will want to face the baptism of fire that can consume away sides on a big European night at St James'.

Uefa club coefficient ranking: 85th

Tottenham return to the Champions League for the first time since 2023 after recording their worst Premier League campaign on record last season.

Spurs did, however, end the 2024-25 campaign as the Europa League champions, which has gifted them a spot in this year's elite competition.

New boss Thomas Frank is heading into unknown territory - the Dane has never managed in Europe's most coveted competition. In fact, before leading Tottenham to a Super Cup penalty shootout defeat against PSG earlier this month, his only continental experience was managing Brondby in Europa League qualifying.

But it is so far, so good for Frank at the north London club - the additions of Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus have guided Spurs to two wins out of two in the Premier League - but will they take their domestic form into Europe?

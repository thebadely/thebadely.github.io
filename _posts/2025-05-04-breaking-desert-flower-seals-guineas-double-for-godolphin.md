Let's dive into the details: William Buick celebrates a Newmarket Classic double after Desert Flower's victory

Desert Flower won the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket to complete a dream weekend for owners Godolphin.

Jockey William Buick, claiming his first victory in the Fillies' Classic, rode Charlie Appleby's evens favourite to victory ahead of the Ollie Sangster pair of Flight and Simmering.

It was a fifth successive win for the unbeaten Desert Flower and followed Ruling Court's 2000 Guineas victory on Saturday for Buick and trainer Appleby.

Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin team also won the Kentucky Oaks with Good Cheer and the Kentucky Derby with Sovereignty.

Appleby and Buick are the first trainer and jockey duo to win the 1000 Guineas and 2000 Guineas in the same season since Aidan O'Brien and Kieren Fallon triumphed with Virginia Waters and Foostepsinsthesands in 2005.

"I'm a very happy man, an amazing filly, what  a weekend for Godolphin. To be part of this, I can't put it into words," said Buick.

"This is what dreams are made of. To me, to be the jockey on these horses is a real privilege."

Indicating the Oaks at Epsom on 6 June could be on the agenda, he added: "She's all class and may even get a little further."

Buick made all the running on Desert Flower, who is now priced around 5-2 for the Oaks.

"To have a weekend like this is very special for everybody - it's a huge team effort," added Appleby. "It was a great ride by William."

Sangster, the grandson of the late, influential owner-breeder Robert, was delighted with the performances of Flight (28-1) and Simmering (33-1) in only his third season with a training licence.

"We're elated. We're all here because we want to win, but second and third is fantastic," he said.

Meanwhile, Kieran Shoemark admitted he misjudged his ride on favourite Field Of Gold in the 2000 Guineas on Saturday, leaving his charge too late to catch winner Ruling Court.

"I felt like I had all bases covered, he was travelling supremely well. With the benefit of hindsight I was too confident on my horse," he told ITV Racing.

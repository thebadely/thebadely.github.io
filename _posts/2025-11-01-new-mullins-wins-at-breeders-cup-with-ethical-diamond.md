It has been recently reported that Willie Mullins is the all-time leading trainer at jump racing's Cheltenham Festival

Ethical Diamond came with a stunning late run to win the Breeders' Cup Turf in a course record for Grand National-winning trainer Willie Mullins.

The 20-1 chance, who spent most of his early career jumping over hurdles, surged down the outside under Dylan Browne McMonagle to claim one of Flat racing's biggest races, with more than Â£2m going to the winner at Del Mar in California.

Ethical Diamond, winner of the Ebor Handicap at York in August, triumphed from runner-up Rebel's Romance and third-placed El Cordobes, with favourite Minnie Hauk unplaced.

It is the latest landmark in the remarkable career of Mullins, better known as a jump racing trainer who won the National with Nick Rockett in April.

"This might come second best to winning the Grand National with my son Patrick on board. I couldn't believe it," said Mullins, 69.

Newly crowned Irish champion jockey McMonagle, 22, said: "It's an unbelievable training performance. It doesn't get much bigger than this."

Owners, the HOS Syndicate, have hopes of a big-race double with Absurde running in the Melbourne Cup for Mullins on Tuesday (04:00 GMT).

Dettori to end US career after Breeders' Cup

Forever Young gave Japan a first victory in the meeting's feature race, the Breeders' Cup Classic.

The Saudi Cup victor, ridden by Ryusei Sakai for trainer Yoshito Yahagi, was third last year but held off the 2024 winner Sierra Leone and Fierceness to score this time.

"In horse racing, this is like the Japanese team winning the football World Cup," said Yahagi.

Notable Speech gave Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby and jockey William Buick their fourth Breeders' Cup Mile win in five years.

There was no fairytale ending for retiring jockey Frankie Dettori, whose best finish was third on Khaadem in the Turf Sprint.

Dettori announced on Wednesday that the fixture at Del Mar in California would mark his last rides in the United States, before a farewell stint in South America.

Earlier on Saturday, the British jump racing season moved up a gear as Djelo edged out Pic D'Orhy to win the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby for trainer Venetia Williams and jockey Charlie Deutsch.

Meanwhile at Down Royal, Darragh O'Keeffe guided the Henry de Bromhead-trained Envoi Allen to a record third Champion Chase and 10th career Grade One win.

Here’s what you need to know: The family of a nine-year-old who died from a single stab wound in Weston-super-Mare on Monday have described her as "the most beautiful little soul".

Aria Thorpe was "full of light and joy", her family said as they paid tribute to the "happy-go-lucky" little girl.

"The loss of Aria has devastated us beyond words," they added. "Our hearts are broken in a way we never imagined possible."

A 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with Aria's murder on Wednesday and appeared at Bristol Crown Court earlier.

Aria's father Tom Thorpe, from Portsmouth, said her death was "devastating".

"You will be greatly missed, you special little angel," he added. "A life gone far too early but I hope a life lived well. We all love you dearly. Goodnight darling."

Aria's family on her mother's side said she loved to sing and dance and "took such pride in dressing up, always wanting to look just like her mummy".

"As a family, we are holding one another close and doing everything we can to support each other through this unimaginable time," they continued.

"We are truly touched by the lovely messages we have received from friends and the local community over recent days. It has meant an awful lot to us all."

In a separate statement, her father said: "How sad it's going to be not hearing 'Dad, how long left?' on our long journeys back and forth at weekends.

"How I'll long to hear you asking me to test you with maths, 'numbers' as you called it, to entertain you when you get bored with the iPad. How sad it's going to be not making your buttery crackers, grapes and a yoghurt for your breakfast."

Mr Thorpe said his daughter always found it so easy to show affection to others and ensure those around her were happy "and never bored".

"You were such a brave, kind-hearted and a beautiful innocent soul," he added. "You always put a smile on people's faces with your wacky ways and just outright madness.

"Your other little family down here in Portsmouth will forever miss you."

Dozens of bouquets of flowers have been left in tribute to Aria in the residential street of Lime Close where she died.

A post-mortem examination had found her preliminary cause of death was a single stab wound. Avon and Somerset Police said.

The 15-year-old suspect, who was arrested in nearby Worle a short time after Aria died on Monday evening, has been set a provisional trial date of 15 June 2026.

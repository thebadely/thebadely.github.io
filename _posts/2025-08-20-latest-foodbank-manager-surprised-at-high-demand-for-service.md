Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The new manager of a city centre foodbank has said she is surprised at the high level of demand for its help.

The Gloucester Foodbank has been operating since 2005 and over the last five years, the number of food parcels the charity provides annually has doubled to more than 17,000.

Vicky Ranford said she had not appreciated the level of demand for the foodbank before she started working there:

"I wasn't really aware just how busy it was and how many people are still struggling," she explained. 

"Food poverty was really in the public consciousness during Covid, everybody was aware of it, but you don't hear about it so much now, even though the demand has doubled in the last five years."

Ms Ranford says there is still a stigma attached to getting help from a foodbank.

"People feel embarrassed about it, but the majority of us are only a pay cheque or two away from needing help to buy food or essentials. 

"We make sure people know there's no shame in it, and the whole purpose of us is to help people."  

To mark 20 years since Gloucester Foodbank opened, a campaign has been launched to raise money, encourage donations and recruit more volunteers.

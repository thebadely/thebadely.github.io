It has been recently reported that Liam Manning's first management role was in Belgium with Lommel

Norwich City have appointed Bristol City boss Liam Manning as their new head coach on a four-year contract.

Manning had been in charge at Ashton Gate since November 2023 and led the Robins to this season's play-offs, only to lose 6-0 on aggregate to Sheffield United.

He replaces Johannes Hoff Thorup, who was sacked by Norwich on 22 April with the team 14th in the Championship following a run of six defeats in eight games.

First-team coach Jack Wilshere, the former Arsenal and England midfielder, was put in interim charge for the final two games of the season, but he also left after learning he would not be considered for the permanent post.

"I'm privileged and honoured to have the opportunity to work for this fantastic football club. It's a wonderful club with a big history and tradition," said Manning.

"It's clear, there has already been a lot of valuable groundwork laid in recent seasons â it's now important we build further on that and move the club forward."

An announcement about his backroom staff will be made in due course, with Manning's long-term friend and assistant coach Chris Hogg as well as first-team analyst James Krause, who both worked with him at Ashton Gate, also having strong links to East Anglia.

Manning's contract at Bristol City ran until the end of next season and the Canaries have paid an undisclosed sum to meet a release clause in order to bring him in.

The 39-year-old was born in Norwich and played for the club's academy before joining Ipswich Town - but he never made a senior appearance for them and spent most of his career in non-league football.

His first coaching job was at West Ham and he then took charge of Belgian club Lommel in 2020 before returning to England as MK Dons head coach the following year.

He guided them to the League One play-offs in 2022 and subsequently had an eight-month spell at Oxford United, who were second in the third tier when he accepted an offer to move on to Bristol City.

Despite Bristol City having the smallest squad in the Championship this past season, Manning guided them to their first play-off finish in 17 years, largely built on a strong foundation of home form and squad togetherness.

Only promoted Burnley and Leeds, and play-off finalists Sheffield United bettered their record at home of 13 wins, seven draws and three defeats.

Norwich eventually finished 13th in 2024-25, 11 points outside the play-offs, and are set to embark on their fourth season in the Championship since relegation from the Premier League in 2022.

Last November, Mark Attanasio, whose Norfolk FB Holdings group are now the majority shareholders at Carrow Road, set a target of a return to the top flight in "three to five years" and Manning's task now will be to try and achieve that ahead of schedule.

"This is an exciting appointment, and we are so happy to get it over the line and have him on board," said sporting director Ben Knapper.

"It quickly became clear that Liam's ambitions match our own and we are all committed to driving this club forward towards our targets. 

"Liam knows the league, has consistently demonstrated an ability to outperform resources and his approach aligns with our footballing ideas and strategy.

"He is an exceptionally bright coach who will push himself, and everyone around him, to develop and improve. We are so excited to have him as a key part of our club."

Former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil and ex-Liverpool assistant Pep Lijnders were also spoken to and considered for the head coach role.

Bristol City chairman Jon Lansdown said: "We are disappointed to lose Liam after such a successful campaign. We are assessing all options as we look to replace Liam."

Norwich City's extensive search for a new head coach has led to the club's first ever Norwich-born boss.

Liam Manning's formative years as a Carrow Road season-ticket holder are a nice extra but it's not why he's been appointed.

Canaries sporting director Ben Knapper has expressed frustration that they fell so far short of the play-offs last season. "When I look at the teams that did make it, it confirms that kind of belief," he said.

Envious eyes were being cast in the direction of Ashton Gate where Liam Manning's well coached team was outperforming the sum of its parts.

It felt like Manning was onto a good thing at Bristol City, and the fact that Knapper has managed to sell to him the project of rebuilding a squad that finished 13th should offer any concerned Canaries fans some much needed encouragement.

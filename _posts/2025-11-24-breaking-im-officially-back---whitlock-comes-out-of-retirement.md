Let's dive into the details: Max Whitlock was seeking to become the first gymnast to win medals on the same apparatus at four successive Games in Paris

Three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock is coming out of retirement to target a place at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.

The 32-year-old, who is the most successful British gymnast in history, had initially announced that the 2024 Paris Games would be his last.

However, Whitlock says his career felt "unfinished" after missing out on a place on the podium in the French capital. 

"I'm back," he said on The One Show. "It feels unbelievable. I'm officially back, I'm a gymnast again, and that feels crazy.

"Something was itching away at me constantly, it has been for the last year, it doesn't sit right, it feels unfinished, incomplete.

"I feel like I've got an opportunity in front of me, and I'll never get this again. So I'm going back in, a three-year stint, I want to make it to my fifth Olympic Games.

"I know it's a dangerous game to play, but I want to finish it on a high, I want to rewrite the end of my career.

"I would rather take the risk of taking that opportunity, rather than not taking the risk, because I think that's something that fast forward 10, 15 years, I'll look back and think that's something I regret.

"I really want to push it further than I ever have before."

Whitlock, who will be 35 by the start of the LA Games, took pommel horse gold at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, and has three bronze medals - as well as a triumph on the floor.

Yet he now faces a challenge to get back into peak shape and compete against gymnasts who are considerably younger, with the English Championships, the British Championships and the Commonwealth Games all on the horizon next year.

"I had a year out completely, I've come back in slowly," he said. 

"The other week I picked up an injury. I wasn't even doing anything on the pommel horse, I was sitting next to it, I looked at my phone, I looked up, and my neck had gone.

"Who knows what's to come."

Scoreboard

South Africa secured their first Test victory in India since 2010 as they triumphed in a low-scoring thriller inside three days in Kolkata.

The Proteas, who won the World Test Championship at Lord's in the summer, had trailed by 30 runs on first innings - but reversed that to pull off a 30-run victory as the hosts, needing only 124 to win, were bowled out for 93 in 35 overs.

Veteran spinner Simon Harmer, 36, did the damage with four wickets in each innings for match figures of 8-51.

India were a batter short in their second innings after captain Shubman Gill suffered a neck injury and retired hurt on day two.

Gill remains in hospital for observation, with India having announced before play on Sunday that he would take no further part in the game.

South Africa had begun day three on 93-7 in their second innings, a lead of only 63, but captain Temba Bavuma - the only batter to pass 40 in the entire match - forged his way to a defiant 55 not out from 136 balls.

Aided by some big blows from Corbin Bosch (25), Bavuma shepherded the tail well to get them to 153 all out.

Left-arm seamer Marco Jansen quickly had both openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul caught behind to leave India 1-2.

Although Washington Sundar provided some resistance with 31 from 92 balls, he eventually fell to the part-time spin of Aiden Markram, while Harmer and fellow spinner Keshav Maharaj (2-37) ripped through the middle order as India lost their last five wickets in the space of eight overs.

The second and final Test begins in Guwahati next Saturday, 22 November.

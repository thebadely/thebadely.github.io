Ireland Women completed a 3-0 series sweep against Zimbabwe with a 51-run win at Sydney Parade in Dublin.

The hosts secured the series with 65 runs to spare on Tuesday and finished in style after posting 180.

Winning the toss, Ireland opted to bat with Amy Hunter and Rebecca Stokell building a strong partnership.

Player of the match Hunter reached 59 before being caught and bowled by Beloved Biza, while Stokell was run out on 45.

Louise Little contributed 22, while Orla Prendergast (24) and Laura Delany (19) finished the innings not out to set the tourists a target of 180.

Zimbabwe got their innings off to a slow start with Kelis Ndlovu out for nine, and her opening partner Chiedza Dhururu following soon after for 12 - both caught by Stokell after being bowled by Ava Canning and Sophie MacMahon respectively.

Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano (39) and Biza (25) offered resistance for the visitors, but both were caught by Prendergast with Canning taking her second wicket and Cara Murray dismissing Biza.

MacMahon would also claim a second wicket as Prendergast caught Modester Mupachikwa on 17 as Ireland secured the series sweep.

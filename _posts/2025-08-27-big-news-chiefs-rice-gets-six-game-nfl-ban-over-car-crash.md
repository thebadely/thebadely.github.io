According to new developments, Rashee Rice helped the Kansas City Chiefs to a Super Bowl win as a rookie

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice has been given a six-game ban by the NFL for violating the league's personal conduct policy.

The suspension follows Rice's conviction for his role in a multi-vehicle collision in Dallas in March 2024, which led to multiple injuries. 

The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to two third-degree felony charges and was granted deferred adjudication on a 30-day jail sentence.

The NFL said Rice "will serve out the penalty without appeal" and is suspended without pay. He is also barred from taking part in training with the Chiefs.

It means Rice will miss the Chiefs' regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Chargers in Sao Paulo, Brazil on 5 September.

He will also be suspended for games against the Philadelphia Eagles, the New York Giants, the Baltimore Ravens, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Detroit Lions.

He will be eligible to return in Week 7 against the Las Vegas Raiders on 19 October.

The NFL initially considered suspending Rice for more than half of the season but came to an agreement with the NFL Players Association over the duration before a disciplinary hearing that was scheduled for 30 September. 

Rice suffered a season-ending injury four games into the 2024 campaign, following a breakout rookie year in 2023 with 79 receptions, 938 yards and seven touchdowns.

Following his sentencing last month, Rice issued an apology "for the harm I caused to innocent drivers and their families".

"There have been a lot of sleepless nights thinking about the damages that my actions caused, and I will continue working within my means to make sure that everyone impacted will be made whole," he said.

Late wickets leaves Test in balance with England needing 35 to win after dramatic day four

There are still "a lot of things in England's favour" as they seek the 35 runs needed to claim a thrilling series win against India on day five of the fifth and final Test on Monday, says batter Joe Root. 

The hosts, chasing a challenging 374 to win, will resume on 339-6 at The Oval after India fought back with three wickets in the evening session before bad weather ended play early. 

Root scored his 39th Test century in a stunning fourth-wicket partnership of 195 with Harry Brook, who added a 91-ball century of his own but Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton struggled towards the end of the day against India's fired-up seamers. 

"It is quite a fitting end for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same," Root told BBC Test Match Special.

"We are in for a cracker, we are in a good position. We have another heavy roller available.

"Things might happen quicker with new ball, it might be easier to score. 

"A lot of things are in our favour. We have so much ability left in the dressing room and clearly they have had a good passage of play but Monday could be a real good opportunity to get across the line."

There was speculation around whether Chris Woakes would bat, considering his shoulder injury sustained on day one, but he was seen wearing his whites in the England dressing room and Root said he would be prepared to bat if necessary. 

Root was visibly frustrated at his own dismissal, punching his bat after nicking behind off Prasidh Krishna, but said it was in response to his own error rather than a response to the pair's tense exchange on day two.

"I was really frustrated because I missed out, it was really disappointing to not still be there tonight and get us over the line. 

"But we are still in a really good position, a lot of batting left and the two guys out there are very capable of seeing us home.

"It has been one hell of a series, one hell of a journey and we have the confidence in our dressing room."

Root reflects on Thorpe tribute and issues Woakes update

India's seamers had no answers to Brook and Root during their astonishing partnership, with Brook's counter-attacking knock taking all of the momentum after the tourists had removed Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope early in the day. 

But they looked a different side, understandably, when both had departed. Mohammed Siraj charged in as usual and Prasidh Krishna consistently hit a probing length to unsettle England's middle order.

Jacob Bethell was bowled by Krishna for a scratchy five from 31 balls, Overton and Smith could barely get the ball off the square and the delay - initially for bad light and then for rain - halted India's sudden and unlikely charge for victory.

"It [the delay] benefits England massively," said former England captain Sir Alastair Cook on BBC Test Match Special.

"It is a hammer blow for India. The atmosphere would have been unbelievable for India tonight. They were so on top, the only way England could get a run away was a leg-bye." 

But WinViz has England as heavy favourites with an 84% chance of victory which would see them take a 3-1 series win and an enormous confidence boost into the winter's Ashes.

"I think England will get over the line and I think Jamie Smith will do the job. I am hoping Chris Woakes doesn't have to walk out there," said former captain Michael Vaughan.

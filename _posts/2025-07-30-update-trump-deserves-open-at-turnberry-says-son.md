No-one's been better for the game of golf than my father

The son of US President Donald Trump says his father "deserves" to have his Turnberry course host The Open again - but will probably have left the White House by the time it does.

The Ayrshire venue, regarded as one of the best in golf, last hosted the world's oldest major championship in 2009, five years before Trump bought the resort.

However, in an exclusive interview, Eric Trump told BBC Sport: "It deserves it, and I truly think that my father's been a guy who also deserves it."

He added: "There's no-one that's been better for the game of golf. He's been a cheerleader his entire life, because he loves it and he believes in it.

"In time that will be rewarded. We'll be given our shot and again it will be a great honour and a great testament to a great legacy when we do."

But the 41-year-old, who heads up his father's real estate business, including 18 golf courses, said: "I think chances are by the time an Open comes back around, his time in government will be gone and we'll be back to being a strictly commercial company."

President Trump's second term in office will end in early 2029. Host venues for the Open from 2028 have not yet been confirmed.

When asked why he felt Turnberry had been overlooked over recent years, Eric Trump said: "I think the elephant in the room was, frankly, politics, for a very long time."

R&A met Trump's son to discuss Turnberry Open

R&A 'would love' Trump's Turnberry to host Open

Security tightens as Donald Trump plays golf at Turnberry

Earlier this month, the R&A said "big logistical issues" around local infrastructure had to be overcome before Turnberry could be awarded The Open.

The body's chief executive Mark Darbon said the course remained in its pool of venues - but claimed there was "some work to do on the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure around Turnberry".

But Eric Trump disagrees, insisting "the actual infrastructure, the actual plant, the physical location is really second to none, anywhere".

"You could host the Open Championship on that course tomorrow," he added. "It's impeccable, and Turnberry is ready for it."

He added: "I think any challenge can be worked through and solved with smart people."

"I think any challenge can be worked through and solved with smart people", the executive vice chairman of Trump Organisation said. The next two Open venues will be Royal Birkdale and St Andrews, with a decision on 2028 due next summer.

Earlier this year, Eric Trump met R&A officials at St Andrews to discuss the event returning to Turnberry - but does he think his father's divisive presidency remains a concern for the R&A?

"No, honestly, I think it's changed a lot to tell you the truth," he said.

"I think the calculus today is a bit different but no, the political side never came up but I think what the R&A wants is the greatest courses, they're focused on quality."

Darbon has acknowledged that UK government officials have also spoken with the R&A about the possibility of Turnberry hosting The Open.

President Trump hosted the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the course during a visit to Scotland - the country where his mother was born - earlier this week, and called for the championship to return, calling it "the best resort in the world".

Asked about the issue at Monday's joint press conference, Starmer said: "The decision on The Open is not a decision for me."

Eric Trump insisted he did not know whether his father had spoken directly to the Prime Minister about it, but claimed: "Turnberry will win the Open Championship at the right time, based on the merits of it being the greatest golf course on earth, that's what's going to win the day.

"I didn't specifically talk about the championship, but I think he too realises the importance of that asset to the west coast of Scotland and, to frankly, the nation's economy."

He firmly rejected suggestions of the Open's potential return to Turnberry being part of any horse-trading at a time of trade talks between the US and UK.

"That question isn't serious," he said. "You're not doing a deal with the host country. You're doing a deal with the R&A.

"I can tell you my father puts the interest of America above any golf course."

Trump was speaking after he accompanied his father to the opening of a new 18-hole course at the Aberdeenshire resort the family also owns near Balmedie. 

The Scottish government has announced that Â£180,000 of public money is being spent to help bring the DP World Tour's Nexo Championship to the venue next month.

"It's probably the last links course that will ever be built in the UK, and I truly think we have the best 36 holes anywhere in the world," Eric Trump said.

The resort is yet to make a profit, but he added: "Here's the good news. We don't give a damn, right. This is our Mona Lisa. If we spent $100m and never got a penny back, it doesn't make any difference. We wanted to do something incredible."

The Trumps' development of the course has also faced criticism from some local residents concerned about the impact on the environment. 

In response, Eric Trump said: "We've done a hell of a job and for anybody to say that the Trump Organisation hasn't brought economic development to Scotland. I mean, it's freaking laughable, and it wasn't always easy to tell you the truth.

"Frankly, if we weren't as stubborn as we are, we probably would have thrown in the towel many times over."

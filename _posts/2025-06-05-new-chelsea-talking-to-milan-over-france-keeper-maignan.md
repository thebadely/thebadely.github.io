Let's dive into the details: Mike Maignan has been at AC Milan since 2021

Chelsea are in talks with AC Milan over signing France goalkeeper Mike Maignan.

The Italian club value Maignan at about Â£25m but the Blues do not want to meet that price and are in talks about a lower fee.

The 29-year-old has been a regular for Milan since joining on a five-year contract from Lille in 2021.

He has also been first choice for France since Hugo Lloris retired from international football in January 2023, and has won 30 caps since his debut in 2020.

Sources have told BBC Sport that Maignan would be interested in a move to Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea have struggled to find a long-term option in goal since buying Kepa Arrizabalaga in 2018 for Â£71m, which remains the world-record fee for a goalkeeper.

Two years later they signed Edouard Mendy, who left for Al-Ahli in 2023, while Kepa has spent the past two seasons on loan at Real Madrid and then Bournemouth.

In the past two years Chelsea have also signed Robert Sanchez, Djordje Petrovic and Filip Jorgensen but the club appear unconvinced by all three.

Petrovic spent last season on loan at Strasbourg while Sanchez and Jorgensen had spells in the Chelsea first team.

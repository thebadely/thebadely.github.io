Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sharon Yates has been working at Dunoon Mugs in Staffordshire for more than three decades.

Four generations of her family have worked there - her mother, Irene, who has now retired, her daughter-in-law, Leian, and granddaughter, Madi.

But, the company, which was established 50 years ago, is struggling. The firm said its energy bills were now six times higher than they were three years ago; 20% of the workforce was made redundant and staff are working shorter hours. 

Ms Yates told the BBC she "would not be able to cope" if the pottery closed. "It's my life," she said. 

''I just love putting the handles on the mugs. It's hard work, but it's therapeutic," said Ms Yates. 

"I'm proud to work here, it's in my blood."

Three Staffordshire potteries have closed this year, and Dunoon's director Alan Smith said it was "entirely possible" that Dunoon could be next. 

Mr Smith said it was not just their energy bills - the rise in the minimum wage and employers' national insurance made it feel like the company was being "bombarded by all sides".

On Wednesday, Stoke-on-Trent's MPs, the GMB trade union and the industry body Ceramics UK will meet Industry Minister Sarah Jones to call for urgent action to save the potteries. 

Ceramics is one of the most energy intensive industries in the UK and the sector is calling on the government to subsidise what it says are "crippling" energy bills. 

It also wants businesses to be temporarily exempt from carbon emissions penalties.

The directors of Moorcroft Pottery announced last month the firm has stopped trading after more than 100 years. 

It was the latest blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, a city affectionately known as The Potteries.

Ms Yates' mother, 81 year-old Irene, has lived around the industry all her life. 

She said the city was once "buzzing", with more than 45,000 people working in ceramics. 

She met her husband David working on the line at the now-closed Staffordshire Pottery, and added it was "heartbreaking" to think Dunoon Mugs could close too.

"I hope the government steps in to help us," she said.

Last week, Gareth Snell, the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, gave a speech in Parliament, warning the industry faced collapse.

He criticised the government's response to what he described as a "crisis" facing the industry.

Mr Smith also added he was not confident Dunoon would get the help it needed from government. 

''I don't think they behave as if they're interested in traditional industries," he said.

In a statement, the Department for Business and Trade said: "Ministers continue to engage closely with the ceramics sector to understand the challenges and provide support, ensuring the industry is globally competitive as part of our Plan for Change."

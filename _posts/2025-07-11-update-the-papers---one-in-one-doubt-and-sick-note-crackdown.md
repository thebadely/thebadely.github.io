Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Many of the papers lead on the UK-France migration deal, which will get under way "in weeks" according to the i newspaper, while The Guardian says the timetable is still unclear. The Daily Telegraph focuses on President Macron's blaming of Brexit for the rise in Channel crossings. "Brexit lies to blame for crisis" is its headline. 

The Daily Mail calls the agreement "a joke" and "half-baked". Its front page features a picture of migrants on a dinghy with the caption "V for victory". The Daily Express notes the deal has been "ridiculed" after hundreds of more migrants arrived in small boats. "It's one in, one doubt" reads Metro's headline.

The Times reports on a government pilot scheme, in which GPs in England will be told to refer patients to job coaches or the gym, instead of issuing them sick notes. The paper says it's aimed at fixing what it calls the "sick note epidemic". It says the scheme will be trialled in 15 regions, and GP surgeries will be given funding to provide the specialist support. 93% of the 11 million "fit notes" issued by the NHS last year were declaring people not fit for work, according to the paper. Health Secretary Wes Streeting is quoted as saying "we simply can't afford to keep writing people off".

Chancellor Rachel Reeves will put reforms of cash ISAs on hold after backlash from building societies, according to the Financial Times. Its report says the plans to cut tax breaks for the savings accounts have not been abandoned, but Reeves wants more time to consult with industry leaders.

The Daily Mirror says the sacked TV presenter, Gregg Wallace, was told by BBC bosses that they didn't believe he could improve his behaviour. Its report quotes a letter from the head of compliance for BBC TV, Claire Powell, who told the former MasterChef host: "I do not have the confidence you can change". Gregg Wallace denies the allegations of misconduct.

President Trump has been left "red faced", according to the Daily Star's front page. The paper says Donald Trump praised the Liberian President Joseph Boakai for speaking English well - despite it being his country's official language.

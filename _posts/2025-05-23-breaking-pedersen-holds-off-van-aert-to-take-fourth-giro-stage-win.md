Let's dive into the details: Mads Pedersen is the fourth rider this decade to win four stages in a single edition of the Giro d'Italia

Mads Pedersen held off Wout van Aert to claim his fourth stage victory of this year's Giro d'Italia as Isaac del Toro extended his overall lead in the general classification. 

Pedersen powered through on a long uphill sprint towards the end of stage 13's 180km route from Rovigo to Vicenza and was able to maintain a slender advantage over Belgian Van Aert, with Mexico's Del Toro in third. 

"I went a bit earlier than I really wanted to but on such a hard uphill final like this sometimes it's OK to go early because everyone has burning legs the last 100 meters," said Denmark's Pedersen.

"I'm just happy with this one and adding another 50 points to the 'ciclomino' [sprint] jersey so let's see how it goes." 

Pederson is two wins away from the six stage victories managed by Tadej Pogacar in 2024.

Meanwhile, Del Toro stretched his advantage in the battle for the pink jersey by earning a four-second bonus for the stage finish to add to the two seconds he collected in the intermediate sprint. 

The UAE Team Emirates rider is now 38 seconds clear of team-mate Juan Ayuso in the general classification race with Italy's Antonio Tiberi in third, another 40 seconds adrift. 

Britain's Simon Yates in fourth as he seeks his first Grand Tour triumph since winning the Vuelta a Espana in 2018. 

Saturday's 14th stage is a largely flat 195km run from nearby Treviso to Nova Gorica across Italy's border with Slovenia.

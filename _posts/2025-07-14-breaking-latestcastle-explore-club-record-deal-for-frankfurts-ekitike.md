Here’s what you need to know: Hugo Ekitike

Newcastle have made a move to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike.

The 23-year-old scored 15 goals and had eight assists last season as his side finished third in the Bundesliga.

Sources said Newcastle are now exploring a potential deal to sign the Frenchman, who would probably cost more than Â£70m.

Despite the interest in Ekitike, BBC Sport has been told Newcastle have no interest in selling last season's top scorer Alexander Isak who has been linked with clubs across Europe including Liverpool.

Sweden striker Isak, 25, joined from Real Sociedad in 2022 for Â£63m, which makes him currently the club's record purchase.

Ekitike only joined Frankfurt last summer after an initial loan spell from Paris St-Germain and is under contract for another four years.

Newcastle finished fifth in the Premier League last season, qualifying for the Champions League.

Last week they completed the signing of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for Â£55m as they look to strengthen their squad for the new campaign.

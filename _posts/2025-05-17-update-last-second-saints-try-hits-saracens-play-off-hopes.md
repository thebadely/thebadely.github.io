Let's dive into the details: Northampton remain eighth in the Premiership after the win 

Gallagher Premiership

Northampton (7) 28

Tries: Kemeny, Haffar 2, Cons: Smith, Hutchinson 2

Saracens (19) 24

Tries: Willis, Gonzalez, Daly, Segun Cons: Burke 2 

Tarek Haffar's last-second try saw reigning Premiership champions Northampton Saints beat Saracens 28-24 and strike a huge blow to Sarries' play-off hopes.

Josh Kemeny's early try for Saints was cancelled out by a close-range Tom Willis score and a well-worked Juan Martin Gonzalez try before Elliot Daly added a third.

Rotimi Segun got the bonus-point try early in the second period before Saints replacement Haffar got one back as the hosts spurned a number of good chances to add to their tally.

Saints ensured a barnstorming finish as they earned a penalty-try after Andy Onyeama-Christie pulled down a maul - and Haffar went over as the clock ticked over the 80-minute mark to secure a great comeback. 

The loss means Saracens remain sixth in the Premiership and must beat Bath - who are already assured of first place - next Saturday and hope other results go their way if they are to make the post-season.

Saints restored most of their regular starting line-up after resting them for the trip  to lowly Exeter last week, as Saracens returned to Franklin's Gardens for the first time since losing there in the Premiership semi-final last season.

Fin Smith's grubber kick was picked up by Kemeny who just had enough momentum to cross the Sarries line in the eighth minute to put the hosts in front.

But Saracens replied almost instantly as Willis forced his way over after a period of pressure following a close-range lineout.

The try count was doubled midway through the half when a lovely passing move was set alight when Elliot Daly broke through the Saints line and set Gonzalez on his way in the right corner.

Gonzalez was again involved in the third try as he passed to Tobias Elliott before an offload to Daly who galloped in under the posts as Saracens led 19-7 at the break.

Long-serving Saracens full-back Alex Goode scored his first try of the season

It looked as thought the win would be a routine one for Saracens when the bonus point was sealed, as Segun got on the end of a five-pass move from right to left from a lineout, especially when Saints had a try ruled out five minutes later when replays showed Alex Coles lost control of the ball as he dived in the corner.

But the hosts grew in confidence as Yaffar scored from close range after an hour before Tom Seabrook missed a golden chance two minutes later as he chased down a kick towards the corner but missed picking up the ball after Ivan van Zyl had slipped.

Saints ended up not regretting those missed chances as they scored twice in the final eight minutes.

First, a powerful lineout maul was stopped illegally by Onyeama-Christie before Saracens struggled to stem a flowing passing move which ended with Yaffar going in after video replays determined there had not been a forward pass in the build up.

Northampton director of rugby Phil Dowson:

"We were drab and lacklustre in the first half but the bench took it to a different physical level.

"The forward pass calls in the final play were in the lap of the gods. It was a 50-50 call but luckily it went our way.

"However, even if it hadn't, our second-half performance spoke volumes about our group as we dominated the second half in terms of possession and territory.

"On the injury front, Curtis [Langdon] has a stinger on his shoulder, which he has had before. Alex Coles has a knee problem and James Ramm had a bang on his shin. All could be doubts for next week but it's too early to assess."

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall:

"It was a painful experience and a hugely-disappointing ending as we were all over the place in the final 20 minutes.

"In the first half we played with intensity and exactly as we had planned to have the better of full-strength European Cup finalists, but after that we were really poor.

"The performance today fully encapsulates our mixed-bag season as the gap between our best and worst is far too wide.

"We didn't deserve to win and just have to suck it up."

Let's dive into the details: Mark King received a five-year suspension for match-fixing in November 2024

Suspended snooker player Mark King says anyone found guilty of match-fixing should be banned for life.

"I don't think anyone should come back - if you're found guilty you should never be able to play again and I stand by that," he told BBC Essex.

The 51-year-old was first suspended by the sport's governing body in March 2023. 

That was after suspicious betting was reported on his 4-0 defeat against Joe Perry in February that year at the Welsh Open. 

Perry was not accused of any wrongdoing.

King has always denied the charge and lost an appeal in May. He was ordered to pay more than Â£113,000 in costs.

He was found guilty of match-fixing in November 2024 and suspended until March 2028.

The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association said "there was no more serious breach of the rules than betting related match fixing" and it had "a long track record of thoroughly investigating such allegations".

The WPBSA added there was evidence King had been involved in fixing match results.

"In this case there was strong evidence against King that necessitated action under the WPBSA's Conduct Regulations. This was vindicated by the findings of two independent KC Chaired Tribunals," a statement added.

King, a former Northern Ireland Open champion, said the situation had put a strain on his family. 

"I think the hardest person affected is my wife. She had a pacemaker fitted not long after the investigation started," he added.

"It's really took a toll on her."

The Essex player, who climbed to 11th in the world in 2003, is a recovering gambling addict.

He said he has struggled with poor mental health since first being suspended.

The WPBSA said the mental well-being of players was always a priority. 

"From the start of this case Mark King was offered a full range of support," it said.

"This was both continued pastoral support, including the availability of counselling therapy through Sporting Chance, the Mental Health & Wellbeing partner of WPBSA Players, and signposting to pro-bono legal advice to ensure that he had access to informed and independent guidance."

Mark King said fellow player Mark Williams reached out to him

After receiving his suspension, King said he received a phone call from three-time world champion Mark Williams and a few other professional players.

"One of the first players that rang me straight away was Mark Williams," King said.

"He said, 'listen, I don't care what's going on. I'm just ringing up to see how you are'. That's a proper friend, we've known each other a long time."

King said he was struggling to pay the costs. 

"Well, I obviously haven't got Â£113,000 in my back pocket for a start," he said.

"I'm out of work because obviously I'm a 51-year-old man. I did a little bit of a labouring job but that was a bit too much for me."

He said he was not sure if he would return to the sport when his suspension was lifted in just under three years.

"I honestly don't know at this time," he added. 

"I love playing and I love the life of it and travelling all around the world and playing but at the same time I still feel hurt and angry."

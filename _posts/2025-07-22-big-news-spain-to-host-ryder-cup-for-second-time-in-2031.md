Here’s what you need to know: Europe beat USA 16Â½-11Â½ in Rome in 2023

Spain will host the Ryder Cup for the second time in 2031, with the event to take place at Camiral Resort in Girona.

The 48th edition will be held at the venue previously known as PGA Catalunya and will see Spain host it for the first time in 34 years.

In 1997, Seve Ballesteros captained Europe to a 14Â½-13Â½ victory over the United States at Valderrama.

It will only be the fourth time the Ryder Cup will have been played in continental Europe after Paris in 2018 and Rome in 2023 followed Valderrama as hosts.

Camiral's Stadium course has hosted several DP World Tour tournaments, including the Spanish Open.

Europe are the current holders of the Ryder Cup, having won in Rome.

This year's event is being held at Bethpage Black in New York from 26-28 September.

The following two editions will be held at Adare Manor, County Limerick, in 2027, and Hazeltine National, Minnesota, in 2029, before its return to Spain.

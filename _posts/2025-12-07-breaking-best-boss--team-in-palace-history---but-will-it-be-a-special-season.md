Guehi scores late header to secure Crystal Palace win over Fulham

Fourth in the table, quality all over the pitch and a top manager - Crystal Palace are enjoying their best-ever Premier League campaign.

Marc Guehi's late header secured a tight 2-1 victory away at Fulham on Sunday, moving the Eagles up into the Champions League places.

A yield of 26 points from their 15 opening matches is their highest tally at this point in a Premier League season and makes them serious contenders for a place in Europe's top competition next year.

Eddie Nketiah, who opened the scoring at Craven Cottage on his 50th appearance for the club, said "the sky is the limit" if his side continue this rich vein of form while manager Oliver Glasner was quick to praise his team.

"I could mention many players but it was a huge team effort - that makes me very proud," he said. 

"That's why we are where we are."

But that praise comes just one week after Glasner openly criticised the club for their lack of summer investment following a 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United.

With his contract running out at the end of the season and uncertainty over the future of important players like Guehi and Adam Wharton, concerns remain behind the scenes at Selhurst Park.

Will Palace's owners be able to keep hold of the manager that has brought them such success? And can Palace maintain this level to truly make this a special season in south London?

Glasner joined Palace in February 2024 following successful stints at Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt.

The 51-year-old has since guided Palace to back-to-back record points totals in the Premier League and led them to a first major trophy when they triumphed over Manchester City in the FA Cup last season.

That led to a first ever appearance in a major European competition - although it was downgraded from Europa League to Europa Conference League because of multi-club ownership rules - while they also beat league winners Liverpool to win the Community Shield.

Former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports: "We are watching the best manager and the best team in Crystal Palace's history.

"Those supporters could not have dreamed what would happen to their football club when that man came in."

Selhurst Park has become one of the toughest places for teams to play with Palace unbeaten there in the league this season until defeat by United last weekend.

On the road, their form is arguably even better.

Since Glasner's first game in charge in March 2024, only Arsenal (65), Liverpool (57) and Manchester City (55) have won more Premier League points away from home than Crystal Palace (52).

But the defeat by United prompted Glasner to criticise the club as he suggested the club-record Â£60m brought in by the sale of Eberechi Eze this summer has not been reinvested in the squad.

His side have lost all four league matches they have played after a midweek European match this season, suggesting squad depth and juggling the increased schedule demands has been a problem.

And Glasner was quick to point it out, saying the club had "thrown away" the chance to play an even better season by not spending in the summer.

"When he gets a result he doesn't like, he is not shy in being outspoken about the board or the sporting director," said Carragher.

"They probably have to take it on the chin because he is the greatest manager in their history."

It is clear Glasner is an ambitious manager.

It is perhaps also clear that he feels he is being held back by a lack of depth in the squad while he will hope his comments spark a flurry of January transfer window action.

Glasner's contract is set to expire in June and the ambitions of the club and the manager will need to align quickly if the success they are currently enjoying is to continue.

"There's a huge talking point around Glasner himself with his contract," former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.

"If you're a director you're trying to tie him down. The job he's done is phenomenal - winning the FA Cup and Charity Shield and getting Palace into Europe. You couldn't ask for any more.

"He was angry and upset after the United game as he felt he wasn't backed in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens in January and the summer and if they back him."

Guehi's contract runs out at the end of the season and interest from Liverpool in the England defender, who was close to a move away from Palace this summer, is only going to intensify given their defensive troubles.

Prolific playmaker Wharton is a man in demand with several clubs interested in his services.

Meanwhile, talented players like Ismaila Sarr, who is currently injured but will soon be heading to Afcon, and Jean-Philippe Mateta will certainly have dreams of playing Champions League football.

"The squad's not big enough to rest players and it puts more strain on the Premier League games. Top six would be an unbelievable season but big clubs will be trying to do the same," Given added.

This Palace squad might be in their greatest period ever but they are also on the brink of potentially disbanding with the possibility of a stellar campaign being derailed.

It has been recently reported that Leinster bounced back after opening their title defence with back-to-back defeats in South Africa

United Rugby Championship 

Leinster (21) 31

Tries: Osborne, O'Brien, Van der Flier, Deegan, McCarthy Cons: Byrne 3 

Sharks (5) 5

Try: Hooker 

Leinster shook off their early-season woes to secure a deserved bonus-point United Rugby Championship win over the Sharks at Aviva Stadium. 

Having fallen to the Stormers and Bulls in South Africa, the URC holders quickly seized control and led 21-0 inside 27 minutes through Jamie Osborne, Jimmy O'Brien and Josh van der Flier tries. 

South Africa international winger Ethan Hooker pounced on a Harry Byrne mistake to bring the Sharks back into the game before half-time.

However, Max Deegan and Gus McCarthy scored the only tries in a low-key second half to ensure a comfortable return to winning ways for Leinster.

Leo Cullen's side host Irish rivals Munster at Croke Park next week, while the Sharks will target a first win of the season when they welcome Ulster to Durban. 

Bolstered by the return of five British and Irish Lions, Leinster looked slick with ball in hand in a performance that will please both Cullen and Andy Farrell, who names his squad for Ireland's autumn Tests on Wednesday. 

James Lowe - a key cog in the Ireland team - was instrumental in Leinster's opening try, with his neat grubber kick putting Osborne through for the opening try in the 11th minute. 

The hosts were initially frustrated in their search for a second when Robbie Henshaw was held up over the line. Moments later, though, they launched a rapid play from a scrum as half-backs Fintan Gunne and Harry Byrne combined to tee up an onrushing O'Brien. 

And when returning Lion Van der Flier marked his first outing as Leinster captain with the home side's third, it looked a long way back for the Sharks. 

However, a loose pass from Byrne - who replaced Sam Prendergast in the line-up - allowed Hooker to intercept and give the South Africans a glimmer of hope before the break. 

Following a scrappy start to the second half, Leinster were given the chance to kick to the corner when prop Ruan Dreyer was penalised for a head-on-head tackle on Van der Flier. 

While Dreyer avoided a yellow card, Leinster pounced from the resultant line-out as Osborne put Deegan through in the corner to crush the Sharks' slim hopes of a second-half fightback. 

With the visitors' challenge already having fizzled out, replacement hooker McCarthy dotted down a gift of a try after Bongi Mbonambi's line-out throw eluded his team-mates. 

While Jack Boyle was yellow-carded for an infringement in the scrum, Leinster enjoyed a stress-free finish to the game as they returned to form in time for next week's inter-provincial derby.

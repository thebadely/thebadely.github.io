According to new developments, Liverpool, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace all played double-header friendlies as they ramp up their preparations for the upcoming season.

The Premier League champions faced Athletic Bilbao twice on Monday, giving Arne Slot the opportunity to play his entire squad for as many minutes as possible.

A total of 32 players featured as Liverpool rotated heavily between matches as they build up to the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.

In the first game, Alexis Mac Allister featured for an hour and Darwin Nunez played 80 minutes, with the Uruguay striker finding the net in a 4-1 win.

Slot then named a different starting XI and bench for the second match as Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez and Hugo Ekitike made their home debuts in a 3-2 victory.

Fans could see back-to-back matches for the price of one match ticket, but weren't permitted to leave and re-enter the stadium between games.

It's a format that has been replicated by other clubs in pre-season, with Crystal Palace playing twice in a day against German side Augsburg.

Manager Oliver Glasner said: "I'm very satisfied with this double test. At the end of a really intense training camp, we had good tests - and taken a step forward."

Bournemouth also played twice against Championship side Bristol City in behind-closed-doors friendlies before travelling to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series.

Opposition boss Gerhard Struber saw the benefit of the double-header, saying: "We were able to give a lot of players minutes in that format and it was an important exercise."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Archie Vaughan's 95 included 11 fours

Metro Bank One-Day Cup Group B, Clifton Park, York

Yorkshire 247 (48.4 overs): Revis 85, Hill 41; Ball 4-34

Somerset 252-4 (49.1 overs): Vaughan 95, J Rew 53*; Revis 2-30

Somerset beat Yorkshire by six wickets

Four-wicket seamer Jake Ball and opener Archie Vaughan, with a career-best 95, starred as Somerset ended Yorkshire's 100% start to this season's One-Day Cup.

Somerset joined their hosts on 12 points at the top of the Group B table courtesy of this six-wicket win at York with five balls remaining. 

Both counties have won three and lost one at the halfway point of the group stage and while Yorkshire still hold sway courtesy of a superior net run-rate, they were second best on a used Clifton Park pitch.

Yorkshire lost wickets in clusters at either end of a scrambling innings which saw Ball take an excellent 4-34 from 9.4 overs and Matthew Revis top-score with a middle-order List A best of 85 off as many balls.

Ball's best List A figures in just over six years preceded Sheffield-born teenager Vaughan's classy 127-ball effort with 11 fours. It was ironic this senior best should come against the county for whom his father Michael starred.

Yorkshire, inserted, slumped to 28-3 inside 10 overs.

Without injured in-form opener Imam-Ul-Haq (hip), they lost Adam Lyth bowled by a beauty from Ball, Will Luxton run out next ball and James Wharton caught behind one-handed going low to his right by James Rew off Ben Green.

Luxton misjudged a push to mid-off, where Josh Thomas mis-fielded before recovering to throw the non-striker's stumps down.

Revis, who hit nine fours, held things together on the pitch used for Tuesday's win over Lancashire, with Yorkshire compiling nothing more than a workable total.

Fin Bean, on 28, cut 18-year-old debutant seamer James Theedom to backward point with the score on 72 in the 18th over.

Revis reached a 49-ball 50 shortly before Yorkshire reached the halfway mark in their innings at 115-4.

He found an ally in fellow all-rounder George Hill. They calmly shared a recovery fifth-wicket partnership of 102.

Yorkshire then lost four quick wickets, including Revis and Hill caught pulling, as the score fell from 174-5 in the 36th over to 204-8 in the 42nd. Green's second wicket accounted for Revis, 34-year-old Ball's second was Hill for 41.

Tom Lammonby's left-arm seam also claimed two wickets in that period.

Dan Moriarty heaved the only two sixes of Yorkshire's innings in a career-best 30 before holing out to cover as Ball struck twice in the 49th over to wrap things up.

Opener Vaughan, in his first competitive senior career appearance against his birth county, steered Somerset's stress-free chase.

Lammonby was well caught at deep gully by Lyth off Hill en-route to 48-1 after 10 overs before 19-year-old Vaughan shared a second-wicket partnership of 70 with Lewis Goldsworthy (30).

Vaughan reached his fifty off 65 balls but Goldsworthy fell at 111-2 in the 25th over when he top-edged a pull at Revis to long-leg.

Vaughan continued on unflustered, sharing 64 with his captain James Rew. But he was bowled looking to go over the top against Dom Bess's off-spin. Still, at 175-3 in the 38th over, Somerset were in a strong position.

James Rew finished unbeaten on 53 off 62 balls, while brother Thomas also contributed 31.

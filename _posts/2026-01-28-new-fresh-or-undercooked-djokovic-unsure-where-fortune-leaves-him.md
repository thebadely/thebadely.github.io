According to new developments, Novak Djokovic has only played 11 sets at this year's Australian Open and spent little over nine hours on court

Novak Djokovic is planning to double his thanks tonight.

Partly in gratitude for what has happened so far at the Australian Open. Partly in hope for what lies ahead as he chases a record 25th Grand Slam singles title.

Djokovic could not hide his relief when Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who led their quarter-final by two sets to love, had to quit with injury.

It was more fortune for the 10-time Melbourne champion, having already received a fourth-round walkover when Czech opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew with an abdominal issue.

Feeling fresh is a positive for the 38-year-old Serb going into Friday's semi-final against Jannik Sinner.

But equally, being undercooked against the 24-year-old Italian, who is bidding for a third straight title, is a worry.

Djokovic has played just two sets since his third-round win on 24 January - and he lost both of those.

"I have no idea at this stage of my career what serves me [well] and what doesn't," fourth seed Djokovic said.

Djokovic says he largely feels fine physically, with a blister on his foot his biggest concern.

It is a marked difference to some of his previous Australian Open campaigns.

Last year, he quit in the semi-finals because of a hamstring tear sustained in a super-human effort to beat Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round.

In 2023, he won the title despite playing with a three centimetre tear in his hamstring. 

Two years earlier, he also triumphed despite tearing an abdominal muscle in the third round.

Djokovic cannot afford any physical issues if he is going to beat Sinner and then potentially 22-year-old Alcaraz in Sunday's final.

"You always have some minor issues with your body, at least for me every single day," Djokovic said.

"But major issues, no. Thankfully, that's still not posing a challenge for me and obstacle in order for me to be able to play and move around the way I want to."

Djokovic feels being injury-free is a stroke of luck as he attempts to become the oldest Grand Slam men's champion in the Open era.

Considering his meticulous pursuit of almost every record there is in the sport, it feels wrong to put anything Djokovic down to fortune.

But avoiding a default in the third round, followed by a walkover and then a retirement, is an enviable pattern.

Against Musetti, Djokovic also recovered from falling victim to his own exemplary sportsmanship.

As he served to stay in the second set, Djokovic conceded a point by admitting to umpire James Keothavong he touched a ball on its way out. The Italian would go on to claim the game.

"I'm going to double my prayers tonight," Djokovic said.

There is no doubt Djokovic needs to be sharper both technically and mentally if he is to end Sinner and Alcaraz's recent dominance at the majors.

Musetti was superb against Djokovic, but there was no escaping the fact the Serb was poor by his lofty standards.

"I think I've underperformed for the level that I showed throughout this tournament," Djokovic added.

"I have to play better - no doubt about it.

"I know that if I'm feeling well and the body is holding on and I'm playing well, then I always have a chance."

According to new developments, Dan Evans has a main-draw wildcard for this year's Wimbledon 

British number five Dan Evans believes he has "put his name back out there" after his run at Eastbourne ended with defeat in the quarter-finals.

Evans upset world number 13 Tommy Paul on Wednesday but fell 6-2 6-3 to American Jenson Brooksby a day later.

The 35-year-old has claimed two top-20 wins in as many weeks, beating world number 14 Tiafoe at Queen's at the start of the grass-court season before seeing off Paul in Eastbourne.

He also beat world number 49 Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia in the first round at Eastbourne.

"In an hour or so I'll reflect on this week, it's been great," Evans, who was ranked inside the top 30 two years ago, told BBC Sport.

"I've put my name back out there a bit. I've got a great event coming up. 

"It is just positives leaving Eastbourne."

Evans is now back in the top 200 and has been given a main-draw wildcard for Wimbledon, which begins on Monday.

Evans was convincingly beaten by Brooksby in windy conditions, losing serve four times and failing to set up a break point of his own.

"It was really difficult conditions," said Evans. 

"It's not easy but that's tennis, you have to recover and get back out there. It all felt very quick today."

Brooksby will face Ugo Humbert in Friday's semi-final after the Frenchman beat British number four Billy Harris 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 on Thursday.

Harris, who will also be in next week's Wimbledon main draw, was knocked out in the quarter-finals at Eastbourne for the second successive year.

Like Evans, Harris' match took place on court one and not the tournament's centre court - something Evans described as "disappointing".

"I do have questions as to why no British players were on centre court today," Evans said. "

"The British fans come here to watch British players."

'Incredible stuff' - Fritz hits hotdog to win amazing point

Defending champion Taylor Fritz won two matches in one day by battling through "crazy" windy conditions at Eastbourne.

After Fritz's second-round tie with 18-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca was suspended at 6-3 6-7 (5-7) for bad light on Wednesday, the pair resumed on Thursday afternoon, with Fritz edging the deciding set 7-5.

That match finished at 12:47 BST - and four hours and 23 minutes later Fritz returned to centre court to face Marcos Giron in the quarter-finals.

Fritz came through 7-5 4-6 7-5 against his American compatriot to reach the last four.

"I love this tournament. I've been very lucky to not play in very windy conditions," Fritz, a three-time champion in Eastbourne, said.

"It's tough for me when I don't get to play the tennis that I love to play here. I have to scrap and play crazy tennis when it's windy.

"I'm obviously really glad to get through it."

Fritz, who beat world number three Alexander Zverev in the Stuttgart Open final 11 days ago, is among the favourites for the Wimbledon title.

He faces world number 28 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Friday's semi-final after the Spaniard beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-4 7-5.

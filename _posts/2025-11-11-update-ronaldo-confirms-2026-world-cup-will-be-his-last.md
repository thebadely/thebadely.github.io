Let's dive into the details: Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for most caps in men's international football with 225 for Portugal

Portugal striker Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed the 2026 World Cup will be his last.

The 40-year-old, who has scored 953 goals for club and country, also said he would retire from football in "one or two years".

Next year's World Cup, taking place in Canada, Mexico and the United States, would be Ronaldo's sixth.

In an interview at the Tourise Summit in Riyadh, when asked whether 2026 would be his last World Cup, Ronaldo said: "Definitely, yes. I will be 41 years old and I think [this] will be the moment in the big competition."

Ronaldo, who plays his club football in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, is the all-time leading men's international goalscorer with 143 - while he continues to pursue a milestone 1,000 career goals.

The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus player said last week he would retire "soon" but confirmed on Tuesday it would likely be in the next couple of years.

"Let's be honest, when I mean soon, it's probably one or two years I'll still be at the game," he said.

Ronaldo helped Portugal to the Euro 2016 title, but the World Cup is one of few major trophies missing from the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's cabinet.

Roberto Martinez's side have yet to qualify for next year's tournament but will secure their spot if they beat Republic of Ireland on Thursday.

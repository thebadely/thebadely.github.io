Great Britain's Alfie Hewett saved two match points to beat Gustavo Fernandez and reach the French Open wheelchair singles final.

Second seed Hewett had not dropped a set in his first two matches but had to come from behind to beat Argentina's Fernandez 4-6 6-4 6-7 (12-10) in two hours and 46 minutes.

Hewett saved two match points in the 10-point match tie-break to set up a rematch of the 2023 final against Japan's Tokito Oda.

He said afterwards he had flashbacks of last year's semi-final - when he lost to the same opponent over three sets - in his head.

"I'm just happy that I didn't bottle it. It means everything to me and I didn't want history to repeat itself," Hewett said.

"I think the strongest bit of what I did today was my mentality, because when momentum is with him it's very difficult to disturb his rhythm."

World number one Oda beat Martin de la Puente 6-4 6-4.

Hewett is a 10-time Grand Slam singles champion and has won the French Open title three times.

The 27-year-old was also due to play alongside fellow Briton Gordon Reid in the men's wheelchair doubles final on Friday but that match has been moved to Saturday.

The British duo - who are five-time defending champions in Paris - will face Oda and France's Stephane Houdet for the title.

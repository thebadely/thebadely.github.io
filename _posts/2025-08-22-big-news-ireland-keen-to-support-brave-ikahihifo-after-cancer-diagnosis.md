Let's dive into the details: Shannon Ikahihifo has won three caps for Ireland

Ireland co-captain Edel McMahon says the squad are behind Shannon Ikahihifo after the forward revealed she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.

New Zealand-born Ikahihifo, who has won three Ireland caps, was part of the training squad for the Women's Rugby World Cup but was not selected in the final panel for the tournament. 

In a post on Instagram on Friday, the 30-year-old Trailfinders player said: "Crazy to think that one day you can be running around on the rugby pitch feeling completely fine, then five days later you're sitting in a hospital room being told you have cancer.

"Still a little in shock if I'm honest, but I'm so blessed to have the most amazing husband, family, and friends that always carry when things start to feel a bit heavy.

"Fair to say she's been a pretty tough few weeks. But lucky we're tougher."

Speaking on Friday, after the Ireland team for Sunday's Pool C opener against Japan was named, McMahon praised Ikahihifo for sharing her news.

"We found out as a group a little bit earlier than everyone else heard, but we respected Shannon's space that she wanted to deal with this herself and even get to terms with what the news entirely is," said McMahon. 

"A credit to her to be so brave to come out. It would be very easy to fall into the background and not say anything and not raise awareness herself."

McMahon added: "I know Breast Cancer Awareness is actually happening next month, but the full group are here to support her and we're all thinking of her.

"But at the same time, she's so selfless in that she didn't want to distract from rugby itself and all of the good work that's going on for World Rugby and this campaign.

"She was like, 'I don't want it to be about me', but that's Shannon to a T. The squad are definitely thinking of her and we're here to support her whatever that looks like."

It has been recently reported that Doncic was at the Dallas Mavericks from 2018 to 2025

Luka Doncic starred for the Los Angeles Lakers with 33 points as he helped them beat his former side, the Dallas Mavericks 116-110.

The Slovenian, playing in Dallas for the second time since being traded to the Lakers last February, also registered 11 assists and eight rebounds. 

"We counted after the game, he [Doncic] had six straight stops where they targeted him," said Lakers coach JJ Redick. 

"Just a fantastic job from him. Then [he] makes the game-sealing defensive play with the charge on [Naji] Marshall."

"It's a special place," Doncic told ESPN of his return to Dallas. "I mean, I'm always going to want to win no matter what. Every game I want to win, but obviously this one's a little bit different."

Doncic scored twice from beyond the arc in the first quarter as the 26-year-old became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 1,500 three-pointers.

He had been with Dallas from 2018 until last year, and said he almost went to the home dressing room at half-time as he "was kind of confused".

The Lakers trailed by 15 points with seven minutes and 41 seconds remaining, but overturned the deficit to secure a third win in four games.

LeBron James scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter, while Max Christie top scored for Dallas with 24 points.

"I think the biggest thing this year, he's just more comfortable," said James about Doncic., external 

"Understanding the system, understanding the city, the city embracing him. Understanding it's his team, and we're all rallying around him. 

"Obviously we know it's emotional, a big game, to come back and play your former team. He showed who he is tonight."

The result leaves the Lakers fifth in the Western Conference, while the Mavericks are 12th.

Elsewhere, Kevin Huerter made a three-pointer just before the buzzer to help the Chicago Bulls beat the Boston Celtics 114-111, while Bam Adebayo scored 26 points as the Miami Heat thrashed the Utah Jazz 147-116.

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Timberwolves' home game against the Golden State Warriors was postponed until Sunday following federal immigration officers shooting and killing a man in Minneapolis.

"The decision was made to prioritise the safety and security of the Minneapolis community," said an NBA statement.

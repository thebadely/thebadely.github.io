Experts revealed that Rachel Reeves has urged Labour MPs to unite behind her Budget as she vowed to stay on as chancellor in the years ahead.

Speaking to a meeting of Labour's Parliamentary Party on Monday evening, Reeves warned MPs they must "stick together" if they wanted to win the next election. 

The Budget, which is expected to contain tax rises, will be delivered on Wednesday following weeks of speculation.

Reeves said she thought Labour MPs would like 90-95% of her spending plan but warned they would have to accept the tougher measures as well saying: "It's a package, not a pick-and-mix. You can't say you like the cola bottles but you don't like the fruit salad."

"It all comes together and hangs together as a whole."

She said her three priorities would be: "Cutting the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and cutting the cost of debt."

Following the meeting, one Labour MP said the chancellor had been "strong and honest" but another said she had sounded "desperate". 

Despite Reeves' call for unity, on Tuesday morning three Labour MPs turned up to a protest – also attended by Green Party leader Zack Polanski - urging the chancellor to consider implementing a wealth tax.

Asked why he was attending a protest alongside the leader of an opposition party, Neil Duncan-Jordan said "this is about an issue, not about what label people are wearing".

"My view is we should be taxing those with the broadest shoulders – they should be carrying the heaviest burden."

In the year since the last Budget, Labour MPs have become increasingly critical of Reeves's judgement.

The chancellor has been forced to make U-turns on some policies, including cutting the winter fuel payment.

There had also been concerns in the party about suggestions she would use this Budget to raise income tax rates, a move that would have broken the party's election manifesto promise. 

The government now appears to have stepped back from that proposal. 

Instead, it could consider extending the freeze on the levels at which people start to pay income tax and national insurance, meaning more people are drawn into paying more tax on their wages and pensions over time.

The chancellor could also look at a range of smaller measures to raise money including new taxes on high-value homes in England, electric vehicles and gaming companies.

She needs to find more money in order to meet her own rules aimed at reducing debt and borrowing, while closing a gap in public finances, estimated to be around £20bn. 

Other possible money-raising measures include:

Reeves has also suggested she will scrap the two-child benefit cap, which limits the benefits parents can claim for their third child or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.

The triple lock - which means the state pension increases by either 2.5%, average earnings growth or inflation - is expected to stay in place, while the living wage is likely to rise.

Ahead of the Budget, ministers have announced that pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes will be subject to the sugar tax. 

Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said he worried the Budget would see "tax on hard- pressed hard-working people being transferred into the benefits system". 

Speaking at a conference on Monday, head of the Confederation of British Industry Rain Newton-Smith urged Reeves not to inflict "death by a thousand taxes" on businesses. 

She said the chancellor should have "the courage to take two tough decisions rather than 20 easier ones".

Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper accused the government of "rank hypocrisy" over its potential tax plans. 

"Rachel Reeves once accused the Conservatives of 'picking the pockets' of working people by freezing tax thresholds - now Labour plans to do exactly the same," she said.

According to new developments, Delphine Cascarino helped France beat eventual champions England in the group stage at Euro 2025

France forward Delphine Cascarino has joined London City Lionesses on a three-and-a-half-year deal after leaving San Diego Wave.

Cascarino agreed to terminate her contract with the Wave on Sunday - the National Women's Soccer League club saying that she wanted to be closer to home.

The 28-year-old had signed for the Wave in 2024, having spent her entire senior career up to that point with Lyon, where she had won the Women's Champions League six times, in addition to nine French league titles.

Cascarino has played 86 times for France, helping them reach the quarter-finals of the Olympic football tournament at Paris 2024, and the last eight again at Euro 2025 - providing an assist in each of their group stage wins over England and the Netherlands.

Cascarino said: "England - for men and women - is the country of football. It's always been a goal of mine to play in this league.

"I want to play in the Champions League here at London City and win many trophies."

London City Lionesses, playing in the Women's Super League for the first time this season, are currently seventh.

Head coach Eder Maestre added: "I'm so excited with this signing. I really think she is one of the most exciting forwards I have seen. She is a dribbler who can take on players in one-vs-one situations, and she will be very powerful on the wing.

"Everybody can see how good she is when she plays and I want that warrior-like and winning mentality off the pitch too, to help us reach our goals.

"She has won six Champions Leagues, so she has the ambitions and the knowhow to win, on and off the pitch."

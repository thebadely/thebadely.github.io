Delacroix and Ruling Court head the runners in a field of 19 set to contest Saturday's Derby at Epsom.

Ryan Moore will ride Delacroix, one of three contenders - alongside The Lion In Winter and Lambourn - for Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien, who is seeking a record-extending 11th win in the race.

Moore and O'Brien are seeking a Classic double after claiming the Oaks with Minnie Hauk on Friday.

"Delacroix has form on all types of ground and he's a big, powerful horse. We feel he has gone the right way every week really," said O'Brien.

Ruling Court, for Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby, will bid to become the first 2,000 Guineas victor to win the Derby since Camelot in 2012.

Appleby has warned, however, that his participation would be in doubt if there was significant rainfall.

The going at the Surrey track is described as good to soft, good in places.

"If all of a sudden we get a deluge and the ground becomes very testing, then conversations will have to be had during the build-up to the race over whether we participate or not," said Appleby.

"So there is a warning out there, but I think we'll be OK."

Dante Stakes winner Pride Of Arras is one of two Derby entries for Ralph Beckett, who also has Stanhope Gardens, although the pair have been drawn 16 and two - two stalls that have never produced the winner.

John and Thady Gosden run York runner-up Damysus and the fifth-placed Nightwalker in the biggest Derby line-up for 22 years.

Approximate Derby odds: 3-1 Delacroix, 9-2 Ruling Court, Pride Of Arras, 7-1 The Lion In Winter, 9-1 Lambourn, 12-1 Damysus, Midak, 14-1 Stanhope Gardens, 25-1 Bar.

Delacroix was installed as ante-post favourite after winning two Derby trials at Leopardstown and was the pick of stable jockey Moore.

Colin Keane will partner The Lion In Winter, who was sixth when odds-on favourite in the Dante, and is expected to improve for that run although has been drawn widest of all in 19.

Stablemate Lambourn, the Chester Vase winner, will break from 10 - where 11 previous winners have started since stalls were introduced in 1967.

Buick will partner Ruling Court from stall seven for Appleby while Tornado Alert, fourth in the 2,000 Guineas, represents fellow Godolphin trainer Saeed bin Suroor.

As well as Nightwalker, owners Juddmonte have added French challenger New Ground to the Â£1.5m race for a supplementary fee of Â£75,000.

The Francis Graffard-trained Midak has also been added to the race and he will carry the colours of the Aga Khan Studs, with the race run in honour of the Aga Khan IV, who owned legendary Derby winner Shergar and died in February.

Charlie Johnston is double-handed with Lazy Griff and Green Storm, with Al Wasl Storm, Nightime Dancer, Rogue Impact, Sea Scout, Tennessee Stud and Tuscan Hills completing the field.

Here’s what you need to know: In a season where Kilmarnock have looked desperately short of confidence and quality, they displayed plenty of both to finally end their long winless run against Aberdeen.

The Killie fans had to wait 119 days since their last victory â a 2-0 win over St Mirren in October â but left Rugby Park in fine fettle after watching their team dominate the 10-man managerless Dons in a 3-0 win.

Neil McCann is barely in the door as manager, but the relief he and his players can now put all talk of the winless run behind them was palpable.

"The fans have waited a long time for this," McCann told BBC Scotland.

"It was so important the boys got a win today because since I've come in with Billy [Dodds] and joined the club - their attitude has been first class.

"I could feel there was something coming, the turn coming. I just felt today was a right good opportunity. Playing at home today, could we get that elusive result, and I'm so happy for everyone concerned with the club we managed to do that. And do it in style as well."

"I couldn't pick a standout from the team. From the first minute to the last everybody who took to the pitch today had belief about them - which is what we've been missing.

"There was a real snap about us and aggression about our play, and some of the football we played was so good."

Sportscene highlights: Kilmarnock v Aberdeen

Kilmarnock looked like they may just be starting to find some solutions to the problem areas in their team. 

The departure of Kyle Vassell in the summer has left them without a focal point in attack, and McCann brought in three forward players to beef up his options â Findlay Curtis on-loan from Rangers, Moldova winger Nicky Clescenco and Manchester United striker Joe Hugill.

All three started on the bench, and it was a player already in the building who provided Killie with that presence up front from which the rest of the team could thrive.

Tyreece John-Jules was excellent. He held the ball up, brought his team-mates into play, provided a lovely assist for Bruce Anderson to fire his side into a 2-0 lead and scored a cracking goal himself to put the result beyond doubt.

It was a sign of the confidence coursing through the big striker that he even attempted an audacious bicycle kick in the second half, though the less said about that the better.

John-Jules and Anderson led the press that unsettled Aberdeen from the off, with Dom Thompson's energy up and down the left flank key for Killie with and without the ball.

As much as the forward players caught they eye, McCann rightly highlighted his team's defensive efforts.

Kelle Roos looked more assured in goal and came up with a couple of big saves, while Robbie Deas, after a shaky start, made some crucial interventions. 

His double goal-line block to deny Kevin Nisbet and then Topi Keskinen just before half-time was outstanding. A goal for the Dons at that moment, against a team with fragile confidence, could have changed the whole dynamic of the game.

It is only a third league win of the campaign for Killie and they remain three points adrift of St Mirren in 10th, having played a game more.

But with the winless run behind them, a first victory for McCann and fresh faces in the squad, Killie are able to look forward to Wednesday's trip to Ibrox with renewed belief.

"I want us to catch fire," McCann said. "I want it to be a catalyst, a platform we can launch from. We've got a really tough game midweek at Rangers which we need to recover for.

"But the boys deserve to let loose tonight and just enjoy that victory because it has been such a long time."

Let's dive into the details: Carlos Alcaraz (right) beat Jannik Sinner in a deciding set tie-break at the French Open last month

Wimbledon 2025

Venue: All England Club Dates: 30 June-13 July

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

The last time Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner met in a Grand Slam final it turned into an epic encounter lasting almost five and a half hours.

Now, 35 days on from that French Open thriller, they will meet again in Sunday's men's final at Wimbledon.

After ending Novak Djokovic's hopes of achieving a 25th Grand Slam title, world number one Sinner was asked what fans could expect when he faces Alcaraz once again.

"We saw the last final - you never know [what will happen]," he said.

"Hopefully it's going to be a good match like the last one, I don't know if it can be better because I don't think it's possible.

"But we will do our best."

For those who somehow missed that epic encounter at Roland Garros, here's a reminder.

Alcaraz, the defending champion, recovered from two sets down - saving three championship points on the way - to beat Sinner.

Both players pushed themselves and each other to the limit in a classic contest that showcased all of their shot-making, athleticism and resilience.

Despite it being an all-time classic, Alcaraz has not yet got around to watching it back.

"I've just seen a few clips and a few points but not that much," he said after his semi-final win over Taylor Fritz.

"I am still thinking about that moment sometimes.  It was the best match I have ever played so far. 

"I'm not surprised he pushed me to the limit. I expect that on Sunday."

Sinner and Alcaraz are very much the dominant force in the men's game as we enter the post-'Big Three' era of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic.

The pair have won the last six majors between them and will wrap up a seventh on Sunday.

Only once before in the Open era have the top two seeds met in the men's singles final at the first three Grand Slams of the year - and that was in 1978.

"I reach the final stages, I reach the semis of every slam this year, but I have to play Sinner or Alcaraz," Djokovic said following his defeat.

"These guys are fit, young, sharp.  I feel like I'm going into the match with tank half empty."

But Sinner does not believe his and Alcaraz's recent dominance can be mentioned in the same breath as that of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.

"You cannot compare what the big three did for 15-plus years," he said  

"Six Grand Slams are one-and-a-half years. It's not that big yet."

Alcaraz is 22 and Sinner is 23, meaning there will be plenty more years of the two meeting in major finals.

Right now it is Alcaraz who has the measure of Sinner, with the world number two winning the past five meetings between them.

Since the start of his title-winning run at the China Open in September 2023, Sinner has lost just 11 of the 127 matches he has contested - meaning almost half of his losses in that time have been to Alcaraz.

But the last time they met at Wimbledon back in 2022, it was Sinner who came out on top.

"I remember that match, but it was three years ago," Alcaraz added. "We are completely different player on grass, but on all surfaces.  

"I'm pretty sure that it's going to be different."

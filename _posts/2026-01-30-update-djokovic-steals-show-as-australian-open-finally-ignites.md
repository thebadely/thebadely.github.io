Djokovic shows immense resolve to set up final against Alcaraz

The Australian Open loves to market itself as the 'Happy Slam'. In truth, there has been some dissatisfaction that this year's edition has been far from classic.

A lack of high-quality matches and dramatic moments have left many complaining the Melbourne event has been a bit of a dud.

But the entertainment dished up on day 13 has finally ignited the opening major of the season.

Carlos Alcaraz's herculean effort to beat Alexander Zverev in Friday's first men's semi-final looked likely to be the headline act.

Though Novak Djokovic, never the type to play support, had other ideas. 

The irrepressible 38-year-old produced one of the most jaw-dropping results of his career - no mean feat given everything he has achieved - to topple Jannik Sinner in the second semi-final and steal the show.

"I watched Alcaraz v Zverev, what an incredible match. We tried to match that intensity," Djokovic told the Melbourne crowd.

"I think you guys got your value for money on the tickets, that's for sure. I want 10% from tonight's tickets sold!"

The second week of the Australian Open had largely lacked jeopardy and excitement, with the top seeds rolling through the men's and women's singles in a series of straightforward wins.

Alcaraz beating Zverev was only the fourth match from the last 16 onwards - across both draws - to go longer than straight sets.

Another quickly followed. Djokovic emerged victorious from a pulsating contest which left thousands of Serbian fans dancing around Melbourne Park in disbelief at 1:30am.

"I first watched Novak here when I was nine years old - this is the most amazing feeling I've had," said 27-year-old Sasha Stanisic, who was among the hundreds watching on a big screen outside Rod Laver Arena.

"For me, this is a close second among his greatest achievements - just behind his win in the 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer. It's been a special night."

Djokovic's implausible victory - given his age and doubts about his physical condition - ended the possibility of another Grand Slam rendezvous between Alcaraz and Sinner, who most expected to meet for the fourth major final in a row.

Instead it will be a third battle for one of the sport's biggest prizes between Djokovic and Alcaraz, after their Wimbledon finals in 2023 and 2024.

Both players are going for historic feats. Djokovic is one step away from landing a standalone 25th major title which has been proving elusive, while 22-year-old Alcaraz bids to become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam.

Before Sunday's showpiece, there is another appetising match-up when Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina contest the women's singles final on Saturday.

Two of the most powerful players on the WTA Tour going toe-to-toe promises to be a blockbuster encounter.

Given the superstars involved and engaging storylines, a slow-burning Australian Open looks set to finish with a flourish - a case of better late than never.

"This tournament hadn't really set on fire. So this special day with two epic matches is what we had been waiting for the whole fortnight," former British number one Annabel Croft said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Cramping Alcaraz beats Zverev in epic to reach final

Another episode in the day's drama surrounded Alcarazâs own physical state. 

World number one Alcaraz says he did not bend the rules by taking a medical timeout against Zverev - who suggested the Spaniard had benefited from favouritism.

Alcaraz seemed to be cramping at 5-4 in the third set and was allowed to see the physio, even though Grand Slam rules say players are not allowed medical timeouts for muscle spasms.

Players can take a three-minute timeout for physical injuries or illness but not for cramping, which is regarded as a conditioning problem rather than a medical issue.

Alcaraz went on to lose the set before winning a five-hour classic 6-4 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (3-7) 6-7 (4-7) 7-5 as the Australian Open sparked into life.

"I didn't think it was cramp at the beginning," said Alcaraz.

"I went to run to the forehand side and I started to feel the right adductor. [The physio] decided to take the medical timeout."

Both men's Grand Slam semi-finals went to five sets for the first time since Wimbledon 2018

Despite attempting to play down the issue, Alcaraz glugging pickle juice - an acidic liquid found to stop cramping 40% faster than drinking water - was a sure sign that it was an issue.

Germany's Zverev was furious as he remonstrated with the match supervisor, accusing the officials of giving Alcaraz preferential treatment. 

Afterwards, third seed Zverev reiterated he "did not like" the decision before adopting a more conciliatory tone.

"To be honest, I don't want to talk about this right now, because I think this is one of the best battles there ever was in Australia. It doesn't deserve to be the topic now," said the 28-year-old, whose quest for a maiden Grand Slam title continues.

Alcaraz said quitting the match never entered his head, adding: "I just hate giving up".

Alcaraz has a tattoo on his wrist which is a tribute to the family phrase coined by his grandad - 'Cabeza, corazÃ³n y cojones'.

If you don't understand Spanish it is perhaps better you search online for the literal translation of a motto which Alcaraz abides by.

In summary, the phrase means the ability to show head, heart and courage in times of difficulty.

Once again, Alcaraz showed all three qualities when he dipped deep into his reserves to beat Zverev and reach a first Melbourne final.

"When I was younger, there were a lot of matches that I just didn't want to fight any more or I gave up. Then I got mature," he said.

"I hate that feeling [of giving up] after all.

"Every step more, every one second more of suffering, one second more of fighting is always worth it. 

"That's why I just fight until the last ball and always believe that I can come back in every situation."

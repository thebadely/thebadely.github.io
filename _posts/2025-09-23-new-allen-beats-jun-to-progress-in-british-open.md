Let's dive into the details: Allen won the English Open title on Sunday

Mark Allen progressed to the second round of the British Open with a 4-1 win against China's Jiang Jun.

Allen, who claimed his first ranking title in 19 months with victory in the English Open final on Sunday, raced into a 3-0 lead in Cheltenham.

The Northern Ireland player edged out Jun in the first two frames and then fought back from trailing to claim the third frame.

Jun did hold on in frame four to get on the board, but former world number one Allen finished the job in the fifth frame to move into the next round.

He will face 18-year-old Hungarian Bulcsu Revesz in the second round on Wednesday.

Let's dive into the details: Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party will remove all net zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected.

Badenoch is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on "maximising extraction" and to get "all our oil and gas out of the North Sea" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday.

Reform UK has said it wants more fossil fuels extracted from the North Sea.

The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A  spokesperson said a "fair and orderly transition" away from oil and gas would "drive growth". 

Exploring new fields would "not take a penny off bills" or improve energy security and would "only accelerate the worsening climate crisis", the government spokesperson warned.

Badenoch signalled a significant change in Conservative climate policy when she announced earlier this year that reaching net zero would be "impossible" by 2050.

Successive UK governments have pledged to reach the target by 2050 and it was written into law by Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove. 

The Tory leader said a Conservative government would scrap the need to reduce emissions or to work on technologies such as carbon storage. 

Badenoch said it was "absurd" the UK was leaving "vital resources untapped" while "neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed". 

In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was "entirely consistent" with net zero commitments.

Reform UK has said it will abolish the push for net zero if elected. 

The current government said it had made the "biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first of a kind carbon capture and storage clusters".

Carbon capture and storage facilities aim to prevent carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from industrial processes and power stations from being released into the atmosphere.

Most of the CO2 produced is captured, transported and then stored deep underground.

It is seen by the likes of the International Energy Agency and the Climate Change Committee as a key element in meeting targets to cut the greenhouse gases driving dangerous climate change.

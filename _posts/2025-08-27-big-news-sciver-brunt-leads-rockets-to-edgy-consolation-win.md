Scorecard. Table

Nat Sciver-Brunt's 52 from 29 balls led Trent Rockets to a consolation three-wicket win over Birmingham Phoenix in their final game of The Hundred.

Rockets were cruising to victory, reaching 102-3 in pursuit of 124 to win, but Phoenix dragged themselves back into contention by removing the England captain with 35 balls to go at Trent Bridge.

Her departure triggered a collapse of four wickets for 17 runs and left five runs needed from the last 10 balls, but number nine Kirstie Gordon and 20-year-old batter Jodi Grewcock held their nerve as the latter struck the winning runs with three balls to spare. 

Sciver-Brunt's knock, which included six fours and two sixes, ensured the middle-order wobble was not costly, but it was a brilliant solo effort with Grace Scrivens' 16 the second highest contribution. 

Left-arm spinner Phoebe Brett, 19, was the pick of the Phoenix bowlers, taking 3-19, but they were left to rue a disappointing batting performance that left them defending a below-par total. 

Phoenix's 123-6 was set up by opener Emma Lamb's unbeaten 56 from 42 balls, her second fifty of this year's Hundred and her 17th across all formats as her stellar summer continues. 

But she struggled for support, having lost her opening partner Georgia Voll early for six, and was stuck at the non-striker's end during a tricky middle phase against the Rockets spinners. Phoenix captain Ellyse Perry departed to Kirstie Gordon for 14 and Amy Jones was tamely caught and bowled by Ash Gardner for nine.

But Lamb held her nerve to rotate after her side wobbled to 93-5, before a flurry of boundaries from Ailsa Lister and Em Arlott at the death helped them to a positive finish.

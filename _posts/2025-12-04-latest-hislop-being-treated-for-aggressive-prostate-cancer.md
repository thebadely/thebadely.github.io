It has been recently reported that Shaka Hislop made 221 Premier League appearances for Newcastle, West Ham and Portsmouth between 1995 and 2006

Former Premier League goalkeeper Shaka Hislop has said he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer, and urged men of Caribbean heritage to get tested for the disease.

On Thursday, the 56-year-old ex-Newcastle and West Ham player shared a video on Instagram, external, explaining that he has just completed nearly two months of radiation therapy.

"Roughly 18 months ago, I went for my annual physical and insisted on a PSA test [blood test that checks for prostate conditions], as I always do. This time around though my PSA was elevated," Hislop said.

"An MRI and biopsy quickly determined that I had a fairly aggressive prostate cancer. 

"A year ago, almost to the day, 6 December to be exact, I had a radical prostatectomy. And I thought that was it.

"But then, six months later, my PSA was again on the rise and another scan showed that my prostate cancer had spread to my pelvic bone.

"I started on medication pretty soon after, and just this morning completed seven and a half weeks of radiation therapy. The journey continues."

Hislop shared footage of him ringing a bell at Massachusetts General Hospital in the United States, to signify the completion of the treatment.

The Institute of Cancer Research says one in four men with black African or Caribbean ancestry are affected by prostate cancer, compared to one in eight men with white European ancestry.

"Allow me to speak to my community, my people. Please, go get tested. Know your PSA, track its history," said Hislop, who was born in London but played for Trinidad & Tobago at the 2006 World Cup.

"Prostate cancer is survivable if caught early enough. There are treatments for it. Testing saves lives. It saved mine."

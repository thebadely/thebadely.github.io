Let's dive into the details: Darren Fletcher made 342 appearances for Manchester United and won 80 Scotland caps

No matter who is appointed Manchester United caretaker manager until the end of the season, Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford.

Fletcher stepped up from his day-to-day role as United's under-18s coach to replace Ruben Amorim for the games against Burnley and Brighton.

The former United and Scotland midfielder is adamant he has looked no further than that and is relaxed about what comes next.

However, Fletcher has made a hugely positive impression on United's powerbrokers.

It maybe should not be a surprise because that is exactly what happened when he came back to the club in October 2020, and then joined Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first-team coaching set-up in January 2021.

"I was surprised I got offered the two games because I wasn't expecting it," he said.

"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand, so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all.

"But I know that I can do it and I'm comfortable doing it.

"I know the environment, and I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years I've been here.

"I've had great experiences as a player, took my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now."

Fletcher has done a variety of jobs since his return to Old Trafford. He initially coached the under-16s before Solskjaer called on him, believing his "winning mentality, commitment and hard work" would be valuable in the culture he was trying to create.

Only two months later he was appointed United's first technical director, underlining the impact he was making.

A senior United figure at the time said that limited period proved to be a "good advert" for Fletcher, as officials gained a greater understanding of his "intelligence".

They saw first-hand what they felt were key elements - a hunger, tremendous work ethic and thirst for knowledge.

These were elements of the elusive DNA United had been searching for - and still are in the wake of Amorim's exit.

One story told about Fletcher from that time relates to a game at Liverpool, two weeks after joining Solskjaer's team.

Fletcher went into the directors' area before the game for the first time and "everyone just thronged around him".

"He kept the room listening to his stories for 15 minutes," said a source who was there.

"Humble" is a word used to describe Fletcher at the time.

Fittingly, it was a trait Fletcher mentioned when talking about the youngsters in United's academy on Friday.

Following Jason Wilcox's arrival at the club in the spring of 2024, Fletcher reverted to a role as first-team coach under Erik ten Hag but Amorim decided he did not need the Scot, which many believe was a mistake.

Fletcher then assumed the under-18s role, waiting until twin sons Jack and Tyler had moved beyond that age group before taking over in the summer.

Though not one of the standout stars of Sir Alex Ferguson's reign, the legendary Scottish boss loved his fellow countryman for the understated way he went about his job.

Some feel the absence of Fletcher through suspension after he was sent off in the semi-final against Arsenal was a significant factor in United being beaten by Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final, when they had no answer to the metronomic passing game of Pep Guardiola's side.

Fletcher, father of younger twin girls, in addition to Jack and Tyler who were both brought into the first-team squad by Amorim in recent weeks, is privately relaxed about what comes next.

Publicly, the 41-year-old says he is happy to revert to his role with the under-18s, where he has been helping to develop promising youngsters, including England youth international JJ Gabriel and Jim Thwaites, who has earned rave reviews in a variety of midfield positions.

"I've tried to prepare myself to be a manager," said Fletcher.

"It is something I always thought I might be quite good at or that I'd enjoy doing and enjoy the challenge of.

"But at the same time I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for when that moment came.

"It's not something I'm desperate to do - circumstances in life dictate that, and I've experienced how intense it has been as a manager for less than a week. There's not much time for much outside football.

"But if I prepare myself and the opportunity comes for me one day, I know I'll be ready. If it doesn't and it means staying as the under-18s coach, I'll be more than comfortable with that as I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United."

Fletcher has ruled out the prospect of 15-year-old Gabriel being called into the United first-team squad for the Brighton game.

While Premier League rules prevent Gabriel being involved in their competition because he was 14 when the season began, the same regulation is not in place for FA Cup ties.

Gabriel trained with United's senior players under Amorim and did the same on Monday, when those who started the draw at Leeds were on a warm-down session.

However, Fletcher, who moved Gabriel into the false nine role with huge success at the start of this season with United's under-18s, says it is too soon for the youngster.

"JJ is a fantastic talent and I've enjoyed working with him immensely," said Fletcher.

"There's a lot of noise around him and deservedly so because he's a really talented kid who works hard and loves his football.

"He makes fantastic decisions and has got an enthusiasm for the game that's just amazing. I'm super excited by his talent and he has a bright future ahead of him.

"But the most important thing is that he keeps developing as he's still got lots to learn.

"His time will come in due course, but for now it's a little bit early I think and a lot of people would agree with me.

"But I couldn't speak highly enough of JJ. He's got an amazing family and amazing support around him and he's somebody we're delighted to have at the club.

"The world is his oyster, and he just needs to go on his journey."

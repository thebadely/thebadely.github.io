Experts revealed that For the second time this season a match at Ewood Park has been abandoned because of a waterlogged pitch

Blackburn Rovers boss Valerien Ismael has said he is willing to make sacrifices to his transfer budget if it means the club will reallocate those resources towards improving the pitch at Ewood Park.

Saturday's abandoned Championship home fixture against Sheffield Wednesday was the second time this season that a match at Ewood Park has been called off due to heavy rainfall, after September's ill-fated fixture with Ipswich was also brought to a premature end.

In both fixtures, Rovers had held a 1-0 lead prior to the abandonment.

Ismael said he had not spoken to senior management at the club about the matter during the weekend when asked by BBC Radio Lancashire.

"I think everyone has got the right to get some clarity, to get some guarantees why it's happened again and what will be the plan," he said. 

"Especially, in the near future, [we need] to make sure that money has to be invested to renew the pitch.

"If I can influence something, if we need to save money in the transfer market to add money to get a new pitch, I will be the first person to [do] it because I want to see fans coming into the stadium to make sure they can see the game.

"If I have to make that sacrifice for the better of the club, I will do it."

'Everyone needs clarity: the players, the staff, the fans, the EFL. Everyone needs clarity and a reliable answer' - Ismael

Rovers were ordered to replay the fixture against Ipswich - a decision that Ismael labelled "disgraceful" - with the game resulting in a 1-1 draw when it eventually took place last week.

When asked whether it was the right call for referee Ruebyn Ricardo to bring Saturday's game with the Owls to a halt, Ismael said it was "embarrassing" that the same situation had happened again.

"I want to have a guarantee that I can do my job properly. The players need the guarantee that I can do the job properly," he continued.

"The fans, when they pay to see a game, they want to see 90 minutes in full and not have to go back home with a big big frustration.

"The next step is not my job to explain that. Someone else [has] to stand up and show up and to explain to people why it's happened again.

"It's a terrible situation, an embarrassing situation and not a nice situation to have. We've got enough issues this season."

Blackburn are due to play Oxford United at home on Tuesday. However, the forecast makes for grim reading, with a yellow Met Office weather warning in place due to the effects of Storm Bran, which is due to strike on Tuesday into Wednesday.

"Tomorrow, if you see the forecast, the weather won't be nice, so we don't know," Ismael said.

"It's terrible to have that pressure on your mind to see that it's your home game, it's a rainy day and everything can happen.

"It's more the long term we have to think about because everyone needs clarity. The players, the staff, the fans, the EFL, everyone needs to have a reliable answer so that we can make sure that this embarrassing situation cannot carry on."

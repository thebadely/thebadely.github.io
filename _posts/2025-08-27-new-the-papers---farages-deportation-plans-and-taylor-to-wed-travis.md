Let's dive into the details: "Finally, a politician who gets it" is how the Daily Mail responds to Nigel Farage's plans to deport as many as 600,000 illegal immigrants if he becomes prime minister. The paper's editorial says while the proposals have been "sneered at" by political opponents, Farage "is in tune with Middle Britain". The message from the Daily Mirror is equally emphatic: "Britain is better than this", with the columnist Paul Routledge saying politicians must look to their consciences before speaking for the sake of decency and humanity.

"How will he achieve return deals with rogue and failed states such as Iran and Afghanistan", asks the Sun. According to a Taliban official quoted in the Daily Telegraph, Afghanistan is "ready and willing" to "receive and embrace" anyone sent by Farage. The i paper says, while Downing Street has not ruled out a returns agreement with Afghanistan in the future, it would not hand over asylum seekers to the current regime.

"Labour bid to head off small boats hits trouble", is the Times headline. The paper says plans to change the law to allow French police to intercept migrant boats at sea are in jeopardy because of the possible collapse of the government in Paris. The Times suggests the "prime concern" for any new administration would be getting an austerity budget passed to cut France's crippling debt and deficit.

"It's a love story" says the Guardian and "baby just say yes" is a Daily Express headline as many papers reuse Taylor Swift lyrics to cover her engagement to the American footballer, Travis Kelce. The Sun says the announcement on social media last night sent Taylor Swift's millions of fans into "meltdown". The Daily Star wishes the couple "all the luck in the world". But the paper uses its editorial to point out that as her back catalogue is littered with songs about her ex-boyfriends, if it does go wrong, she will surely have another hit album in the bag.

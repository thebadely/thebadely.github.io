Here’s what you need to know: Greenwood has won the European Championship with England twice while a Manchester City player

Defender Alex Greenwood has signed a contract extension with Manchester City that will see her stay with the club until 2027, saying she has "unfinished business".

The England international's contract was set to run out at the end of the season.

"It's the club I love and the club I want to be successful at," club captain Greenwood, 32, said.

"Personally, I have so much unfinished business to be done, and I love this football club. It feels like home to me now and I feel this is where I belong and meant to be."

Greenwood has played for Liverpool, Notts County and Everton, and led Manchester United to the Women's Championship title in 2019 before joining Lyon, where she won the Champions League.

She joined Manchester City in 2020 and has played 152 games for the club, winning the Women's FA Cup and Continental Tyres League Cup in that time.

She has also made the Professional Footballers' Association WSL Team of the Year three times.

However the WSL title has eluded her, thanks to Chelsea's dominance in recent seasons.

"She's one of the world's best in her position and a real leader," said Manchester City Women's director of football, Therese Sjogran.

"We're excited by the direction this team is going in this season and beyond and extending Alex's contract was key to those ambitions."

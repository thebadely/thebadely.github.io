According to new developments, A British woman has died from rabies after she was "scratched" by a puppy in Morocco, her family said.

Yvonne Ford, 59, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had light contact with the stray dog while on holiday in February in the North African country.

In a social media post, reported by the Press Association, Mrs Ford's family said she developed a headache two weeks ago and later couldn't "walk, talk, sleep, swallow".

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there was no risk to the wider public due to no documented evidence of rabies passing between people.

Mrs Ford was diagnosed at Barnsley Hospital after returning to the UK, the hospital trust confirmed, and was later transferred to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield. 

She died on 11 June. An inquest into her death opened in Sheffield on Wednesday.

In the Facebook post, her daughter Robyn Thomson said the family "is still processing this unimaginable loss".

"She was scratched very slightly by a puppy in Morocco in February," she wrote. 

"At the time, she did not think any harm would come of it and didn't think much of it.

She continued: "Two weeks ago she became ill, starting with a headache and resulted in her losing her ability to walk, talk, sleep, swallow. Resulting in her passing."

Close contacts of Mrs Ford and health workers were being assessed and offered vaccinations when necessary as a precaution, a UKHSA spokesperson added.

Ms Thomson added: "We never thought something like this could happen to someone we love. 

"Please take animal bites seriously, vaccinate your pets, and educate those around you."

Six cases of human rabies connected to animal exposure abroad were reported in the UK between 2000 and 2024.

Rabies is particularly common in Asia and Africa, the UKHSA said, with people visiting affected countries advised to avoid contact with dogs, cats and other animals wherever they can.

The agency also advised people to seek advice about the need for a rabies vaccine before travel.

Jane McNicholas, chief medical officer at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "We can confirm that we provided specialist care for a patient who had contracted rabies whilst abroad and who has now sadly died.

"Our thoughts are with the family at this devastating time and out of respect for their privacy we will not be providing any further information."

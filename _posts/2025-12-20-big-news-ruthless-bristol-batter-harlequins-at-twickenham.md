Bristol produced a scintillating attacking display to hammer Harlequins 40-14 under the lights at Twickenham Stadium.

In Quins' annual 'Big Game', it was the Bears who came out on top as they ran in six tries and won by 26 points.

Unanswered scores from Kalaveti Ravouvou, Joe Batley, Gabriel Oghre and Louis Rees-Zammit gave the visitors a ruthless 26-0 lead at the break against a Harlequins side that had at times produced some good rugby themselves.

Santiago Grondona added another before Quins finally got on the board through Rodrigo Isgro, when the Bears were down to 14 with Tom Jordan in the sin-bin.

England prop Ellis Genge then scored a stunning 50-metre try before his Red Rose teammate scored a consolation for Quins, as the Bears styled out a stunning win at the national stadium.

After Harlequins had run out 38-12 winners in the Prem Women's Rugby fixture earlier in the afternoon, the men's teams took to the field to a stunning show of lights and fireworks.

And it was Bristol who provided the bright spark right from the early stages as they hit their hosts hard.

Everything Quins put together, the Bears defence was equal to it and the visitors took a firm grip on the match through four devastating attacks.

First, Ravouvou dotted down in the corner after a lovely-weighted pass from Tom Jordan, before Batley rounded of a flowing move involving Jordan, Ravouvou and Benhard Janse van Rensburg.

Oghre darted through to score his side's third before Rees-Zammit got the try of the half, collecting the ball before sprinting downfield, chipping up and over full-back Nick David and diving over the line as Harlequins went in at the break with zero on the scoreboard.

And the hosts were reduced to 14 players inside three minutes of the restart as Jack Walker was sent to the sin-bin for offside on his own try-line, with Grondona running through for what felt like an inevitable fifth try.

Quins were given a lifeline just before the hour when Jordan was shown a yellow card and the home side finally gave the large Twickenham crowd something to cheers as substitute Isgro eventually dived over to get his side on the board.

England prop Genge, who had been replaced but reintroduced because of injury, took the ball from a lineout and sprinted 50 metres to score a stunning try.

Harlequins' luck was summed up when Sam Riley scored but play was brought back after replays showed Isgro's foot had touched the line.

Smith ran through to score, and convert, his side's second try soon after, which would ultimately prove to be a consolation as Bristol secured a memorable victory in London.

Harlequins head coach Jason Gilmore:

"It is very disappointing. We were not in the contest for 40 minutes and just could not get a foothold in it. All the guys were excited about playing another Big Game at this stadium, but we started poorly.

"The half-time talk was about rolling our sleeves up and having a go. And we showed some commitment. 

"We did that in the second half, but you shouldn't have to wait to half-time to roll your sleeves up and fight.

"I thought we were in a pretty good spot going into the contest, but things just didn't go to plan at all."

Bristol boss Pat Lam:

"I was pleased with the whole team. We set about it in the right, positive manner and had the game under control by half-time.

"It's a nice way to start the Prem games again and puts us right near the top. We now need to build on it."

(On Louis Rees-Zammit) "Louis has fitted in really well after returning from his NFL spell in the States.

"He's an outstanding lad who can switch from wing to full-back, where he played tonight. He can do special things and that's what he did here with his try."

It has been recently reported that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has released a string of emails, as pressure builds over her breaking housing rules.

The chancellor rented out her south London family home when she moved into Downing Street - but it emerged this week she did not have the correct rental licence from her local council.

The house falls in an area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a one-off cost of £945.

She has apologised and initially said she was not aware a licence was necessary.

But on Thursday, Reeves said her husband had found emails that showed the letting agent had told them a licence was needed - and that the agent would apply on their behalf.

She has published the two chains of emails dated between 17 July and 13 August 2024, in which Nicholas Joicey, Reeves' husband, and the Harvey & Wheeler letting agents correspond about the necessary steps to rent out the property.

On 17 July, the letting agent tells Reeves's husband that electrical tests need to be carried out on their property, before adding: "Once we have that to hand we will need to apply for a licence under the Selective Licensing Scheme via Southwark Council."

One email from the letting agent also appeared to confirm the company was taking charge of applying for the licence.

In an email dated 22 July, the letting agent tells Reeves's husband "I can arrange the Selective Licence once the tenants move in - would you like me to arrange this for you as well after move in?"

Four days later, on 26 July, Reeves's husband asks how much the the selective licence and some other things will cost, adding: "Subject to this, I would be grateful if you could arrange these."

The letting agent responds the same day to advise that the cost is £900 and offers to arrange for the electric test needed to get the licence too.

On 13 August, Reeves's husband belatedly gets back and says "yes please, do go ahead" and arrange for the licence.

In a response the same day, the letting agent says "I will do the Selective Licence".

Letting agents Harvey & Wheeler said the property manager responsible for applying for the licence on her behalf had "suddenly resigned" before the tenancy began.

In a statement, owner Gareth Martin said: "Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply.

"We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.

"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.

"Our clients would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for. Although it is not our responsibility to apply, we did offer to help with this.

"We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for."

A spokesperson for the Conservatives said that - regardless of assurances received from the estate agent - Reeves and her husband were "responsible" for ensuring a renting licence had been granted.

They have called for Sir Keir Starmer to conduct a "proper investigation" into the incident.

In her updated statement on Thursday, Reeves said: "As I said to you today, I am sorry about this matter and accept full responsibility for it.

"You rightly expect the highest standards from ministers serving in your government and I have therefore shared the correspondence between my husband and the agency with the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, and I am happy to answer any further questions required."

The revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget next month amidst speculation the government could break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.

Here’s what you need to know: A leading UK business lobbying group is calling for a major reset of relations with the European Union, urging both sides to "build bridges" and move beyond Brexit  divisions.

In a report published ahead of a EU-UK summit due to take place on 19 May in London, it calls for "practical steps" to ease travel, cut red tape and take joint action on energy, climate and defence.

The CBI says the current setup is "no longer fit for purpose" in a world of rising geopolitical threats and economic uncertainty.

The EU is the UK's largest trading partner and the government has expressed it's desire to reset relations with the bloc in the form of a new post-Brexit deal.

The government said it would "act in the national interest to secure the best outcomes for the UK" in discussions with the EU, but added that "no final agreement has been made", and that it wouldn't give "a running commentary".

The CBI is asking both sides to make it easier for staff to work across borders, restore recognition of professional qualifications, and reintroduce youth mobility schemes so young people can live and work in both regions.

The government's aims include a defence deal and a wider negotiation of the trading relationship between the UK and the bloc.

A security pact could pave the way for greater UK involvement in EU-wide defence procurement projects, as well as access to a loans scheme for British defence firms.

One of the EU's key demands is for a youth mobility scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work in the UK and vice versa, for a time-limited period.

The UK previously said it had "no plans" for such a scheme, but its opposition to the idea has softened in recent weeks.

Earlier this month, European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Financial Times the UK would consider "sensible EU proposals in this space".

The CBI says youth mobility schemes would open up a larger talent pool to businesses in the UK, as well as providing UK citizens with the opportunity of a wider market of employers. 

The proposals reflect the views of more than 400 UK companies and are aligned with priorities from BusinessEurope, the EU's business lobby group.

Airbus, which employs thousands in the UK, backed the call. "We rely on a smooth flow of people, parts and ideas across borders," the company said. "A stronger EU-UK partnership is good for business and good for Europe."

Industry group Energy UK said that "more cooperation on climate and energy is the low-hanging fruit of our relationship with the EU".

The report also highlighted concerns in Northern Ireland, where new trade rules and looming carbon taxes, it said, could cost businesses up to £200m a year.

Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director-general, said: "The world has moved on - and so must the UK-EU relationship. This is about growth, resilience and global competitiveness. Business is ready to play its part."

The government has ruled out re-joining the EU, including its single market and customs union.

Some polls have indicated that the majority of Britons would accept freedom of movement to be able to rejoin the single market.

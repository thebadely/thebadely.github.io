Let's dive into the details: Fisher (right) suffers a first career defeat in his 14th pro fight 

Dave Allen set the record straight with a conclusive fifth-round stoppage win against Johnny Fisher in their heavyweight rematch at London's Copper Box Arena.

Fisher narrowly won the first fight in December on points, a decision many observers felt should have been awarded to Allen.

After a tentative start by both men on Saturday night, the 33-year-old Allen dropped Fisher with a barrage of powerful punches.

'The Romford Bull' rose to his feet but was dispatched in emphatic fashion, falling face down on the canvas after a ferocious left hook and right uppercut. At the same time, the 26-year-old's corner threw in the towel.

"This means everything to me," said Allen, whose win was his 24th in 33 bouts.

"I've been written off so many times. I knew I had the ability and at the right level, I'm a handful."

After receiving medical treatment, Fisher left the ring without giving an interview.

He had his say soon afterwards, posting on Instagram: "I weren't good enough tonight but that's what boxing is all about and that's what sport is all about.

"The best people keep coming and keep going and don't let one little blip get them down."

Fisher was also dropped in the fifth round by Allen in their first fight

The likeable Allen was introduced as 'the people's champ' and received a warm welcome as he entered the ring.

Fisher â thanks in large part to his social media star father 'Big John' and their 'bosh' catchphrase - is one of domestic boxing's biggest ticket sellers.

The noise turned up a notch when he made his ring walk to Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver, with just a small number of empty seats at the 8,000-capacity arena, nicknamed 'Copper Bosh' by Team Fisher.

Allen failed to land with his telegraphed overhand rights and Fisher snapped out the jab as the contest struggled to catch fire early on.

Fisher, who knocked out Alen Babic in the first round at the same venue last year, landed stinging uppercuts in the third and was given a warning for throwing a punch after the referee called break.

With the 'Bull Army' in full voice, the raucous atmosphere was strikingly different to the low-key first fight in Saudi Arabia.

Allen remained patient, waiting for his opening. Just like he did five months ago, he sent Fisher to the floor in the middle of the fight with brute power and determination.

Then came a highlight reel knockout which drew gasps from those in attendance.

The pair have remained friends since first sparring several years ago and Allen kept his celebrations on hold until Fisher was back on his feet.

Allen paid tribute to his "friend" Fisher after the fight 

With just a handful of amateur fights before turning professional, Fisher began his career with a string of impressive knockout wins.

But after such a comprehensive loss to the seasoned Allen, there are major question marks about his domestic level credentials.

Allen, meanwhile, left the ring with a beaming smile in the arms of trainer Jamie Moore.

The self-proclaimed 'Doncaster De la Hoya' â an homage to the six-division world champion Oscar de la Hoya â Allen has earned a cult following with his relaxed, refreshingly honest and sometimes overly self-critical approach to the sport.

"I can now buy an en suite," he joked after Saturday's fight.

Before the rematch, Allen said he plans to box for another 22 months â until his 35th birthday - and was content in playing the gatekeeper role for other British prospects. After his latest win, he may just elevate those aspirations a little.

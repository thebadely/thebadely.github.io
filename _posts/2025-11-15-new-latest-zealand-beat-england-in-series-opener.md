According to new developments, Grace Nweke starred for New Zealand

England suffered a 61-58 defeat by New Zealand in the opening game of their three-match series.

The Roses, ranked fourth in the world, are facing the second-ranked Silver Ferns as part of the build-up to next year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Both sides gave away the ball 15 times at the Copper Box in London, but New Zealand were the more clinical side.

"Of course it stings, but the margins are tiny," England coach Jess Thirlby told Sky Sports.

"It is just moments where we need to smarten up. Tomorrow is another day.

"We made it a bit easy for them at times. We had too many blips in the circuit."

'I thought my career was over - I felt like punching a wall'

England took an early lead in front of a noisy crowd in their first match since February.

But New Zealand, who denied England a medal at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, fought back and led 15-14 after the first quarter with a score on the buzzer.

New Zealand extended their lead to 33-30 by half-time. Goal shooter Grace Nweke proved near unstoppable and was supported by sisters Kate and Georgia Heffernan, while England made unforced errors.

Thirlby made changes at half-time and her side were reinvigorated for the third period as they stormed back to level at 47-47.

Goal keeper Jaz Brown was impressive on her England debut with crucial steals.

However, the tourists showed their quality in the fourth quarter despite England shooter Eleanor Cardwell coming off the bench for her first appearance since suffering a knee injury which threatened her career.

The second game takes place at the same venue on Sunday and the final match is at AO Arena in Manchester on Wednesday.

England play Jamaica in December.

Here’s what you need to know: Conor Meyler won an All-Ireland medal with Tyrone in 2021

Tyrone gaelic footballer Conor Meyler has announced his retirement from the game at the age of 31.

The Omagh St Enda's player was part of the Red Hands' team which collected an All-Ireland title in 2021, an achievement which was recognised with an All-Star award at right-half back and a Player of the Year nomination.

As well as helping his county secure a fourth All-Ireland success, Meyler was also part of three Ulster Championship winning sides.

Recent seasons have been dogged by knee and achilles injuries for the versatile player however, although earlier this year he returned to inter-county action in Tyrone's All-Ireland series win over Cavan.

He was then introduced off the bench in a quarter-final win over Dublin in what turned out to be his final appearance for the Ulster county as he did not feature in the semi-final loss to eventual Sam Maguire Cup winners Kerry.

Meyler made his inter-county debut against Tipperary in a 2015 qualifier and was part of the side which was defeated by Kerry in that year's All-Ireland semi-final.

Long-serving Tyrone manager Mickey Harte employed him in both defence and attack and he played in the 2018 All-Ireland reverse at the hands of the Dubs.

"As much as the mind still wants to go on, it's finally time to listen to the body and move on from football," said Meyler in a post on Instagram, external.

"I've been incredibly fortunate to live a dream of representing my club and county for over a decade, alongside some of my childhood heroes and closest friends, [with] whom we've shared some incredible moments which I'll cherish for the rest of my life.

"Football has been the most beautiful pursuit and one of my greatest teachers. I have given football every part of me and it has challenged me, taught me tough life lessons, but ultimately it shaped me and gave me every opportunity both on and off the field to become the person I am today."

Meyler went on to thank everyone who had helped him during the course of his playing career.

"To my family and close friends, thank you for being there through the good days and the tough ones, for every sacrifice and all the unseen support. To every county, club, and college teammate, coach and manager, trainer, medical staff member, backroom team, and everyone outside these groups who supported me or walked any part of the path with me I am truly grateful to you all, thank you.

"From a young boy in Omagh kicking a ball against a wall with a big dream who backed and believed in himself I could never have envisaged how it would all unfold.

"This chapter closes with nothing but appreciation, love and gratitude. A young boy's dream lived out. A heart full. Excited for whatever the next phase of life brings me."

In a statement posted on X, external, Tyrone GAA paid tribute to Meyler's "service, leadership and example".

"Throughout his time in the Tyrone jersey, Conor embodied everything the Red Hand stands for - humility, resilience, pride and complete commitment to those he represented," the statement said.

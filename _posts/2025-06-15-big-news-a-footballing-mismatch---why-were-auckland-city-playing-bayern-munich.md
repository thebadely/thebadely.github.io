Here’s what you need to know: Thomas Muller, who is set to leave Bayern Munich in the summer, scored his 250th goal for the club in Sunday's thrashing of Auckland City

It was one of the biggest mismatches you are ever likely to see in professional football.

For New Zealand part-timers Auckland City, upsetting 34-time German champions and six-time Uefa Champions League winners Bayern Munich was always going to be a tall order â to put it very mildly.

Once Kingsley Coman opened the scoring after five minutes at the TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, those dreams of an almighty shock were all but extinguished.

By full-time, Bayern had hit double figures for the first time since August 2021 to set a new Club World Cup record.

It was 10-0 - and it could have been more.

Bayern have won by a 10-goal margin in the Bundesliga before - registering an 11-1 win over Dortmund in 1971 - and their 2021 double-figure victory was a 12-0 cup trouncing of regional league team Bremer SV.

For a while against Auckland, it looked as if the German giants' club-record 16-1 win over DJK Waldberg in the 1997-98 DFB Cup might come under threat.

Goals from Sacha Boey, Michael Olise and Coman made it 4-0 midway through the first half, with Thomas Muller and Olise then scoring Bayern's fifth and sixth before the interval - matching the six goals scored by Al-Hilal against Al Jazira in the previous record victory at the Club World Cup.

Germany international Jamal Musiala only replaced England captain Harry Kane in the 61st minute but there was still ample time for the 22-year-old to net a second-half hat-trick, before Muller wrapped up a crushing victory late on with his 250th Bayern goal.

How seriously are people taking the Club World Cup?

Auckland were perhaps fortunate not to lose by a heavier margin as Bayern peppered their goal with 31 attempts â including 17 on target â while enjoying 71% of possession.

The New Zealanders managed only one shot at Manuel Neuer's goal - Angus Kilkolly's low drive which was easily saved by the veteran goalkeeper.

The gaping chasm between the two sides on the pitch is mirrored off itâ¦

Auckland reported 1.1m New Zealand dollars (around Â£488,000) in revenue for the last financial year, compared to the Bundesliga giants' 951.5m euros (Â£810m).

Auckland's amateur players have a salary cap of 150 New Zealand dollars (around Â£66) per week, while Harry Kane is reported to be earning Â£400,000 per week at Bayern. On that basis, it would take Auckland's best-paid player about 117 years to earn Kane's weekly salary.

Auckland's squad is valued at 4.58m euros (around Â£3.9m) by Transfermarkt, while Bayern's is valued at 903.5m euros (around Â£769m).

Oceania's sole representatives at the tournament, Auckland are getting Â£2.6m in prize money for taking part, while European clubs stand to earn between Â£9.9m and Â£29.6m.

Bayern are currently ranked sixth in Opta's Power Rankings - a global team ranking system - but Auckland are down in 5,074th, over 2,500 places below English National League side York City.

The next lowest-ranked team in the Club World Cup are UAE outfit Al Ain, who sit 625th.

While Bayern boast some of the biggest names in world football, Auckland's team includes a primary school teacher, an insurance broker, a barber, a sales representative at Coca-Cola, a car retailer, and several students.

Remarkably, Auckland left-back Nathan Lobo, 22, will have to sit a university exam from his hotel room during the competition.

Fifa's decision to expand the Club World Cup from seven to 32 teams this summer has already sparked legal complaints from players' union Fifpro and the World Leagues Association.

But the gulf in class between Bayern and Auckland on Sunday is likely to raise further questions about the new format of the competition.

Winners of the Oceania Champions League in each of the past four years, Auckland have made it to the tournament on that merit. Indeed, the New Zealanders are appearing in the competition for the 12th time â more than any other side.

However, whether they should be competing in the same group as a club of Bayern's stature is another matter.

In last year's Fifa Intercontinental Cup,  which comprised six teams and effectively replaced the Club World Cup in 2024, Auckland were thumped 6-2 by Al Ain in the first round.

And in the final seven-team Club World Cup in 2023, they lost 3-0 to Saudi club Al-Ittihad in their only match.

"These games are so special for Auckland City," said former England midfielder Anita Asante, who was co-commentating on Sunday's game for Channel 5. "These guys are heroes to lots of budding football stars in New Zealand."

Fans following BBC Sport's live text coverage of the game were less enamoured by the Group C mismatch:

Sean: Watching Bayern tear apart a bunch of part-timers is just not it and the sooner Fifa realise it, the better. This isn't entertainment at all, let's not kid ourselves otherwise.

Sam: I know Bayern didn't choose who they play, but I do feel putting out this 11 was perhaps not the most sporting thing to do. This match makes uncomfortable viewing.

Richard: Isn't that what a pre-season friendly is for, not a competition with a prize of Â£100m for the winners?

Was there any sympathy for the New Zealanders from their opponents?

Asked after the final whistle whether he felt for Auckland, France international Olise simply replied: "No."

Auckland qualified for the Club World Cup as the best OFC Champions League winners over the ranking period between 2021 and 2024.

They have dominated their continental competition in recent years, winning it 13 times since 2006.

They won four and drew one of their five games in the most recent edition of the tournament, scoring 13 goals and conceding just twice.

Reflecting on Sunday's defeat, Auckland's interim coach Ivan Vicelich said: "This [result] is the reality of football against one of the world's top teams.

"It's a dream for players coming from an amateur level to play in this environment. We knew it was going to be a very difficult game, playing against one of the top teams in the world - potentially one of the favourites - so we're just really proud of the players' efforts."

Bayern boss Vincent Kompany added: "We have to remain modest, but it was important to be able to say that we took the game seriously.

"It was a good first match at the tournament, but of course challengers are going to grow and it's going to become more difficult."

The Bundesliga champions take on Argentine giants Boca Juniors in their next Group C encounter on Friday local time in Miami (Saturday 02:00 BST).

"A traditional team from Europe against a traditional team from South America - even if I weren't Bayern coach, I'd have attended this game," said Kompany.  "It will be special."

It has been recently reported that Thibaud Flament made his France debut in 2021

Lock Thibaud Flament will miss France's Six Nations opener against Ireland because it clashes with his wife's fertility treatment.

Flament was named in the 42-man squad for the tournament, but coach Fabien Galthie said he would be absent at Stade de France on 5 February for "personal reasons".

Flament, who said his wife has endometriosis, told French newspaper L'Equipe: "You can't control the date.

"The timing is based on the menstrual cycle of women, with a whole protocol around it."

He added: "We learned at the beginning of January that ART (assisted reproductive technology) falls in the same week as Ireland.

"Even if I saw this possibility coming, it's not possible to do both, so I won't play."

Hugo Auradou is likely to replace Flament.

Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes, and can cause fertility issues.

ART refers to a range of medical procedures, including IVF, designed to help individuals and couples overcome fertility challenges.

IVF involves fertilising eggs with sperm in a laboratory setting and transferring the embryos into the uterus.

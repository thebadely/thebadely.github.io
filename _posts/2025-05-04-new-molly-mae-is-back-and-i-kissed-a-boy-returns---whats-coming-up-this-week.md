Let's dive into the details: This week, Molly-Mae returns to our screens, with the second part of her TV series promising "exclusive access" to her life.

But that's not all the week has in store.

BBC Three's I Kissed A Boy is back for series two, Sir David Attenborough's film Ocean is released on his 99th birthday, and PinkPantheress is dropping a new album.

Read on for what's coming up this week...

Earlier this year, Molly-Mae Hague broke her silence after being photographed apparently kissing her ex, Tommy Fury, at a party.

I was at the press event where she made the comments, ahead of her new TV series, Molly-Mae: Behind It All.

She told me, and the other reporters, that she and Tommy - who announced their split last year - were "figuring it out as adults, as parents", adding that the situation was "really complicated".

So what can we expect from part two of her documentary series, which launches on Prime Video on Friday?

We're told that, after the "media frenzy" that surrounded the photograph, we will see the former Love Islander "living her dreams" at Paris Fashion Week.

But the series will also reveal how hard she's finding life on her own at home.

Cameras will show her making “life-changing decisions” and taking a trip to give rebuilding her family one last chance.

On Sunday, the UK's first ever gay dating show, I Kissed a Boy, returns to BBC Three.

Dannii Minogue is heading back to the Masseria in her role as Cupid, while the series is voiced by Layton Williams.

The format sees 10 singles matched up, and introduced for the first time - with a kiss to test out their chemistry.

From then on, you can expect love triangles, budding romance, wandering eyes - and plenty of drama.

Pop star Minogue has said she's excited to tell more "diverse and important stories", adding: "I'll have the party started for a wonderful summer of love."

The first series was praised by critics for its inclusive and positive treatment of gay love, and it was followed swiftly by I Kissed a Girl which aired last year.

Last August, PinkPantheress cancelled all her remaining tour dates – including lucrative support slots with Coldplay and Olivia Rodrigo – to concentrate on her health. "I've reached a wall which I am struggling to penetrate through," she said in a statement to fans.

But she's put the downtime to good use. The 23-year-old's new mixtape, Fancy That, is accessible, hypnotic and seductive alt-pop. 

She's been teasing the project since January, when she posted photos from her home studio, captioned: "oh we are soooo back #2025." Speaking to Mixmag, she said listening to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada had inspired "the size of the music".

But it's another dance band whose DNA is sprinkled all over the EP. Basement Jaxx get writing credits on four of the five tracks, with PinkPantheress sampling classic 2000s dance hits like Romeo and Good Luck. Elsewhere, she chops in samples of the music she was raised on, from Sugababes to Underworld.

In a recent Reddit thread, PinkPantheress said the mixtape represented a "more fun" side to her personality than the introspective, "emo asf" lyrics of her debut album Heaven Knows. She certainly seems to be having a blast on party-centric club cuts Tonight and Illegal (sample lyric: "Is this illegal? It feels illegal"); while Stateside giddily documents a transatlantic love affair.

It's all over in about 20 minutes – but what a rush.

On Thursday, Sir David Attenborough turns 99 - and the same day sees the release of his new landmark film, Ocean, in cinemas.

The documentary promises to take viewers on a "breath-taking journey" around the world's seas and oceans, showcasing their vital importance for our survival.

Using underwater footage, it will explore the major threats to our oceans, from destructive fishing techniques to mass coral reef bleaching.

But it also carries a deeply personal message, with Sir David highlighting the opportunity we have to enable marine life to recover.

"After living for nearly 100 years on this planet, I now understand that the most important place on this planet is not on land, but on sea," he tells viewers.

Correction 4 May 2025: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the release date for the game Sonic Rumble as 8 May. However, on 30 April, Sega announced the release had been postponed indefinitely.

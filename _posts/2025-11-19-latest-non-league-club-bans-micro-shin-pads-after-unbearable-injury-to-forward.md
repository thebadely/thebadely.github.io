According to new developments, Ilfracombe Town are trying to raise money to support Riley Malin in his recovery from injury

Non-league Ilfracombe Town have banned 'micro' shin pads after forward Riley Martin suffered an "unbearable" double-leg break in a South West Peninsula League match at the weekend. 

While there are currently no plans to ban the use of the pads, the Football Association says the use of 'mini' shin pads has the potential to "increase the risk of injury".

Ilfracombe Town's fixture at Bridport on Saturday was abandoned after Martin broke his fibula and tibia during a 50-50 challenge with the home goalkeeper. 

"The initial sound of it was unbearable. It was like a shotgun going off," Ilfracombe Town chairman Nick Jupp told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"There is no blame on Riley at all for wearing micro shin pads but I think if he had more coverage on the shin area with bigger shin pads, the injury could have been less than it was."

While shin guards are mandatory under the laws of the game, the rules around them are vague. 

They currently state that pads must be covered entirely by socks, made of a suitable material (rubber, plastic or similar) and provide a reasonable degree of protection. 

Further FA guidance, external says: "The amount of shin physically covered is an important consideration, as any part of the shin that is not covered is not as well protected.

"'Micro' or 'mini' shin pads may therefore increase the risk of injury due to the smaller amount of shin covered compared to larger sized shin pads.

"We advise that when considering the protection offered by shin pads, safety is prioritised by ensuring a good proportion of the shin area is covered and therefore protected."

The International Football Association Board (Ifab), football's lawmaker, has been contacted for comment. 

Ifab has previously said it has no plans to change the rules and stressed that players - or the parents or guardians of youth players - must take responsibility for their own safety on the pitch.

"Players' legs are all different sizes and there are so many different materials," a spokesperson said.

"Ifab's view is that this is the responsibility of the individual player and not the referee. Where young players are concerned, that responsibility [should be taken by the coach, parents or guardians]."

Why are some football shin pads so small?

In a statement, Ilfracombe Town said they have now prohibited "the use of micro shin pads across all age groups and squads, from youth teams through to senior teams".

They added: "This decision has been made in the interest of player safety and welfare, and to ensure that all players are equipped with protective gear that meets required safety standards."

They are not the first club to follow this course of action.  

Penistone Church in Barnsley and a number of others cross the lower reaches of the game have taken similar decisions and support their stance. 

Club chairman Jupp added:  "I think clubs need to look closely at player welfare and safety regarding these micro shin pads. The support we've had on social media so far is unbelievable.

"A lot of grassroots clubs in the South West have banned them since we put out a statement on Sunday evening."

According to new developments, Jury members have been told to ignore the "public attention" surrounding the case of a man whose car injured more than 130 people at a Liverpool FC Premier League victory parade. 

Paul Doyle, 54, was behind the wheel of a Ford Galaxy Titanium which struck a crowd of people, including two babies and six other children, on Water Street in Liverpool city centre on 26 May. 

He denies 31 charges including nine counts of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, 17 of attempted GBH with intent and three of wounding with intent.

Mr Doyle broke down in tears in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court as he was asked to confirm his name, and held his head in his hands as jurors filed in.

Mr Doyle also faces one charge of dangerous driving and one of affray. 

The former Royal Marine Commando, of Burghill Road in the West Derby area of the city, was asked to enter pleas to four counts that had been amended since his last appearance.

These reflected new medical evidence.

He answered "not guilty" to two amended counts of causing GBH with intent, one of wounding with intent and one of attempting to cause GBH with intent. 

The charges relate to 29 people aged between six months and 77 years.

Out of a panel of 30 people, seven men and five women were sworn in as jury members.

Two women were selected to sit as reserve jurors until the end of the prosecution case.

Judge Andrew Menary KC told them: "This case concerns allegations arising from events connected to Mr Doyle's conduct or alleged conduct at the Liverpool FC parade. 

"The incident, as you may already be aware from general public knowledge, occurred in a busy city-centre setting and was subject to public attention."

He said the nature of the case made it "especially important" that they stick to the rules and not pay attention to information from social media, the news or anywhere else. 

Judge Menary said they should try Mr Doyle only on the evidence shared in court. 

"Nothing else forms part of this case," he said. 

Jurors were told Paul Greaney KC will begin opening the prosecution's case on Wednesday.

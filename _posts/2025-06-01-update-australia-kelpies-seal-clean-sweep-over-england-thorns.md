According to new developments, Josh Byron was player of the match in the second game of the series

Australia's men's netball team completed a clean sweep of the Aurora Series against England Thorns with a 64-32 victory in Sunday's third and final match at the Copper Box Arena in London.

The visiting side, known as the Kelpies, had already sealed the series on Saturday, when they moved into an unassailable 2-0 lead with a 62-30 victory at the Motorpoint Arena in Nottingham.   

That followed Australia's opening 63-34 win at the Copper Box Arena on 25 May.

The world number ones produced another dominant display to seal victory in Sunday's finale of the three-match Test series, which was being contested by the two sides in England for the first time. 

England's men only played their first international match in 2022, while their opponents have been competing on the international stage since the 1980s.

And that experience and quality showed as the Kelpies, led by the impressive Josh Byron, opened up a 20-7 lead by the end of the first quarter. 

The match was being played as the first of a double-header, before London Pulse's Superleague game at home to Leeds Rhinos, and the home crowd got behind the Thorns in a much more competitive second quarter. 

But after going into half-time trailing 31-16, England were unable to contain Australia following the break, with the visitors' lead jumping to 49-24 by the end of the third quarter and they eventually ran out winners by 32 points.

Experts revealed that Shaun Wane led Wigan Warriors to multiple trophies before his appointment as England coach in 2020

Shaun Wane has stepped down from his position as England head coach "after careful reflection", nine months before the Rugby League World Cup.

The former Wigan coach, 61, succeeded Wayne Bennett in February 2020 and was in charge for a home World Cup in 2022. England were knocked out in the semi-finals, losing to Samoa in golden-point extra time.

England won home series against Tonga and Samoa in the following two years but then lost all three Ashes Tests to Australia on home soil last autumn.

After that series defeat, Wane said there was "no question" that he was the right person to lead his nation into the 2026 World Cup.

However, in a statement, external announcing his departure, Wane said: "It has been the honour of my life to coach England over the last six years, but after careful reflection I believe the time is right to step aside and allow the programme to move forward into its next chapter."

England's opening pool match at the World Cup is against Tonga in Perth on 17 October, with games against France and Papua New Guinea to follow.

Wane worked on a full-time basis but the Rugby Football League has said the role is "expected to revert to a part-time position" and the governing body will "set out the criteria for a new appointment in due course".

England won 14 of the 19 matches they played under Wane.

Abi Ekoku, the RFL's interim chief executive, thanked Wane for his "leadership and unstinting dedication to making the England team the very best it could be" and added that the RFL "will undoubtedly call upon his vast knowledge and experience moving forward".

Wane spent much of his playing career with Wigan and achieved great success as head coach of the club between 2012 and 2018.

He led the Warriors to three Super League Grand Final wins, a Challenge Cup, one League Leaders' Shield and victory in the 2017 World Club Challenge.

Highlights: Australia complete Ashes clean sweep with win over gritty England

How will Wane's time in charge be judged?

In terms of raw facts, he failed to win a home World Cup or even make the final in 2022, and lost all three games of an historic Ashes series against Australia last year with just two tries scored.

Yet, there were many highlights on the journey too. Strong NRL-packed Tonga and Samoa sides were brushed aside without loss here, while aside from that World Cup semi-final, the performances created an impressive buzz.

He was excellent with the media and the players loved playing for him - those who he picked, at least. Those on his periphery, such as Jake Connor, will potentially see their international route revived following this development. 

If there was a criticism of Wane, you could say some players did not fit his personality type even if they seemed to add something to the personnel mix. There was a nod to control and structure over maverick chaos. Sometimes you need something different against elite opposition.

Whoever comes in, though, will be hamstrung by the same issues Wane faced.

The calendar works against England, with no space for friendlies or even training camps on the paddock during the season, such is demand on clubs and players.

In a World Cup year, it might have been wiser to seek continuity and revamp later.

The new appointment will have no time to instil new philosophies and gameplans, which are vital.

If England were far from beating Australia with a sense of stability and growth, how do they get closer having switched tack and ripped up the plan?

Fair play to Wane. He has stepped aside to give England the chance to go a different route and likely a part-time one.

There ought to be no shortage of candidates, despite the sense of having a hand tied behind one's back in taking on the responsibility.

Wakefield's Daryl Powell, Wigan boss Matt Peet and St Helens' Paul Rowley are all coaches who would bring something to the table if appointed.

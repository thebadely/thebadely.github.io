Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Frankie Dettori enjoyed a double triumph at Ascot in October 2023 in his last race meeting in the UK

Frankie Dettori says he is "super excited" by plans to launch a global jockeys' league for flat racing next year which could potentially see him race in the UK again.  

The 54-year-old is among 12 riders poised to take part in the venture, which will see them compete for points under their own individual team branding.

The league is set be held across 10 events at some of the most prestigious racecourses around the world.

Dettori, a mainstay of the British and European flat racing scene for 37 years but who is now based in the United States, has been signed up to take part along with British riders Ryan Moore and William Buick.

"It's a project they have been working on for a few months and I am super excited," said Dettori, who has ridden more than 3,300 winners during his career.

"It will appeal to a worldwide audience - especially after the 'Race For The Crown' Netflix series - and I can't wait to get started."

James McDonald, Joao Moreira and Christophe Lemaire are also among the other elite riders to have joined up.

Mickael Barzalona, Yutaka Take, Irad Ortiz Jr, Flavien Prat, Zac Purton and Vincent Ho have also been slated to take part.

The league has been co-founded by former Godolphin chief executive John Ferguson and Lachlan Fitt, previously chief financial officer at betting group Entain Australia.

Fitt said the league will seek to "compliment the existing global racing calendar" and they will be aiming for league events to be held "in close proximity to the major racing carnivals across the world".

"It is still early days in our conversations with potential host venues and we are a number of months away from finalising plans in relation to what a launch season could look like.

"We're hopeful there will be a number of opportunities for the league to be racing in the UK in the first 12 months."

Dettori stopped riding in the UK in 2023 but has continued his career in the USA. 

In March the Italian filed for bankruptcy in the UK having been unable to reach agreement with His Majesty's Revenue and Customs over a long-running case of tax avoidance.

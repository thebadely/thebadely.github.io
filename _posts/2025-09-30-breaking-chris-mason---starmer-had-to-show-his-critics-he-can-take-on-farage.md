According to new developments, Sir Keir Starmer was last year's big winner at the general election.

This year saw the prime minister sharpening his argument against Nigel Farage and - by extension - against those within his own party, from the cabinet down, who fret he's not the best frontman for the fight that beckons with Reform UK.

There is a defiance and steeliness to the prime minister; with this performance, he reminded his internal critics just who it was who won that whopping majority in the election 15 months ago.

The year gone by has been a relentless grind â€“ not least the last few weeks, after losing the former deputy PM Angela Rayner and US ambassador Peter Mandelson - and in his speech, the prime minister wanted to remind the audience of the achievements of the past months.

His critics within the Labour party remind him, relentlessly, that Labour's politics must be politically more aggressive, front-footed and pointed in order to defeat a communicator of Nigel Farage's ability.

This speech was the prime minister's response.

It taught us little new about Sir Keir's political creed, but persistently painted the dividing line he wants: Reform versus everyone else.

And he says he's the figurehead for that fightback.

Farage has claimed his migration policy being labelled "racist" by the prime minister had put his staff at risk; it left him "more determined than ever", he said.

Was Sir Keir Starmer's speech up to the challenge? Is this the point where the pace quickens?

The prime minister is now approaching a bleak-looking Budget and a grim set of local elections, and elections in Wales and Scotland, next May.

And even his most loyal allies accept those elections could determine if he's still delivering a conference speech to the assembled party as prime minister this time next year.

Experts revealed that Finn Russell held his leg (right) as he was taken off the pitch in the final stages of Bath's semi-final win

Bath fly-half Finn Russell should be fit for the Premiership final next Saturday after leaving the field with cramp near the end of their semi-final win against Bristol. 

The Scotland and British and Irish Lions number 10 went off limping in the final five minutes at The Rec after kicking 14 points in their 34-20 victory.

Bath head of rugby Johann van Graan said he had no reason to believe Russell would be unable to play when they take on either Leicester or Sale for the title at Twickenham in a week's time. 

"He's in a bit of pain, he's got multiple parts of his body cramping â it's only cramp at this stage," said Van Graan.

"He put in some effort. I thought his goal kicking was phenomenal, the chases that he put in. He'll be fine, but he's still cramping in the changing room as we speak.

"It was amazing how many guys on both sides went down with cramp. It just showed the effort that both teams put in. We worked incredibly hard to get into this position, to get back to Twickenham."

Despite being 13-6 down at half-time against their West Country neighbours, Bath scored four tries during the second half to stretch away from Bristol and reach their second successive Premiership final. 

A year ago they fell agonisingly short against Northampton, but they will return to London as overwhelming favourites to claim their first league title since 1996 and with a treble up for grabs after also winning the Premiership Rugby Cup and European Challenge Cup this season.

Van Graan said his side will "love" every minute of the next week as they build-up to the match.

"A final is once-off," he said. "[I was] speaking to the coaches earlier today [Friday], we had a quiet moment like if you don't come through today that's it, the season's done and you fall short.

"If you go to the final you know next Saturday afternoon at whatever time, you're either going to win the Premiership or you're going to lose in the final. 

"That's the reality of sport but it's one more week and we'll absolutely love it because ultimately if you don't love days like today and weeks like next week then get something else to do."

Johann van Graan has now taken Bath to consecutive Premiership finals

As well as being a semi-final, Friday's match had the added spice of being a derby and the extra feeling of expectation was palpable in the atmosphere from both fans and the players on the pitch. 

Bristol came into the match with the superior head-to-head record - having won five of their previous six Premiership meetings with Bath - and Van Graan said the commentary during the days before had helped give his side "motivation".

Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam had spoken about the money Bath had spent, external compared to the Bears on players, and also about the Recreation Ground ticket prices and lack of roof, external.

"I thought the people of Bath were amazing tonight," added Van Graan. 

"I think I reconfirmed a very valuable lesson in my life this week, two ears and one mouth - don't speak too much and do your talking on the pitch, and our team certainly did our talking on the pitch. And they did it for the city. 

"We certainly got a lot of motivation from Bristol and it's amazing - the more people give the more we got."

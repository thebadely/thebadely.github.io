Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Caelan Doris sustained a shoulder injury in Leinster's Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northampton

Ireland captain Caelan Doris has been ruled out for a period of four to six months through injury, Leinster Rugby confirmed on Monday.

The 27-year-old sustained the injury in the Irish province's Investec Champions Cup semi-final defeat to Northampton on 3 May.

Last week, Doris was left out of the British and Irish Lions squad for this summer's tour of Australia by head coach Andy Farrell.

The back row could now also be a doubt for Ireland's series of autumn matches against New Zealand, Japan, Australia and South Africa in November.

An update from Leinster read: "Caelan Doris had a procedure on Friday last week for a shoulder injury which will keep him out of action for between four to six months."

Doris had been a frontrunner to be named captain for the Lions tour, a role which was given to England second row Maro Itoje.

Leinster team-mate Hugo Keenan said that the province are now even more determined to win the United Rugby Championship title for injured skipper Doris.

"We feel a bit more responsibility to do it for him and make sure that he is lifting that URC trophy up, it might be with one hand at the end of the season!" Keenan joked.

"It is a tough period for him, we can all say he was going to be on that Lions plane, but it is just unfortunate timing."

It has been recently reported that Luke Humphries won in front of a crowd of 4,000, a record for a darts event in North America

World number one Luke Humphries got the better of fellow Englishman Nathan Aspinall to claim a superb victory in the final of the US Darts Masters.

Humphries, 30, followed up his World Masters and Premier League titles with an 8-6 win in the World Series of Darts event at New York's Madison Square Garden.

Aspinall defeated world champion Luke Littler 6-4 in the quarter-finals earlier on Saturday.

"This is the most iconic venue that we play in and it's really special to win this event," said Humphries.

"It's one of the top venues in the world and it's one I've always dreamed of winning. When I finally won, it was an amazing relief."

Aspinall, who won the 2019 tournament when it was held in Las Vegas, made a slow start in the final and was 3-0 down before levelling it at 5-5 thanks to a 90 finish on bullseye.

A 142 checkout from Humphries edged him ahead once more but Aspinall missed two darts to make it 7-7, with Humphries seizing the opportunity and sealing the win with double eight.

Humphries secured his place in the final with a 6-2 victory over American Danny Lauby and a 7-2 semi-final success over Welshman Gerwyn Price, while Aspinall followed up his win over England's Littler by overcoming Australian Damon Heta 7-3 in the last four.

The World Series of Darts continues on 4-5 July with the Poland Darts Masters in Gliwice.

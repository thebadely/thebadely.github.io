Let's dive into the details: Spain's Alex Palou won his maiden Indy 500 on Sunday

Spain's Alex Palou withstood a fightback by Sweden's Marcus Ericsson to claim victory in a chaotic Indianapolis 500.

Palou overtook Ericsson with 14 laps remaining before holding off the Swede's late recovery to become the first Spaniard to win the 109th edition of the showpiece race.

The start was delayed because of light rain and included several yellow flags with the lead changing hands 22 times among 14 drivers.

Marco Andretti, grandson of F1 great Mario Andretti, lasted just four laps after being hit by Ryan Hunter-Reay, while Scott McLaughlin also crashed out after losing control early on and Kyle Larson's attempt to complete the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day was curtailed by a crash. 

Palou, of Chip Ganassi Racing, averaged 168.9 mph over the iconic 200 laps of a 2.5-mile oval track at the Indianapolis Brickyard, while 2022 winner Ericsson finished 0.682 seconds behind, with American David Malukas in third.

Mexico's Pato O'Ward finished fourth and Sweden's Felix Rosenqvist fifth.

Two-time champion Takuma Sato led for 51 laps before falling out of contention after skidding into his pit, while pole-sitter Robert Shwartzman's challenge ended on lap 89 when he collided with members of his pit team - though no-one was badly hurt.

Larson, meanwhile, was able to safely exit his car after the crash on lap 91 before being cleared to fly to Charlotte to compete in the Nascar event.

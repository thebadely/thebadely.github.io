It has been recently reported that Kylian Mbappe joined Paris St-Germain from Monaco in 2017 and went on to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer

France captain Kylian Mbappe is seeking 263m euros (Â£231.5m) from Paris St-Germain, with his former club demanding 240m euros (Â£211m) from the player, as their long-running dispute reached a Paris labour court on Monday. 

The 26-year-old Real Madrid forward is claiming the sum, which includes 55m euros (Â£46.3m) in unpaid wages, from the European champions as damages in response to a contract dispute and alleged perceived ill-treatment by the club.

PSG, however, are claiming their figure as compensation for Mbappe's failed 300m euros transfer to Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal in 2023. 

He joined Spanish giants Real Madrid on a free transfer the following summer. 

The tribunal is not expected to come to a decision for several weeks.

Why are PSG and Mbappe facing each other in court?

The long-running dispute began in July 2023, when Mbappe turned down the move to the Saudi Pro League.

Mbappe believes he was sidelined by the French champions for that decision and for refusing to sign a contract extension.

He was not invited to take part in PSG's pre-season tour of Asia and missed their first match of the season before being reinstated to the side.

PSG claim this followed the player's agreement to forgo some of his end-of-contract payments to protect the club's financial health.

However, Mbappe's representatives have dismissed this as "fantasy", with the player still waiting for salary and bonus payments. 

Following Monday's hearing, PSG said they were seeking "recognition of the significant damages suffered by the club" for what they called Mbappe's "serious breaches of his legally binding contractual commitments".

The club say Mbappe "acted disloyally by concealing for nearly eleven months, between July 2022 and June 2023, his decision not to extend his contract".

They also rejected any claim of "harassment or pressure" and said Mbappe "benefited from exceptional conditions for seven years at Paris St-Germain".

Mbappe was at PSG from 2017 to 2024, and scored 256 goals in 308 games, winning 15 trophies.

The Real Madrid striker was initially claiming 55m euros (Â£46.3m) in unpaid wages from the Ligue 1 champions in a dispute which went through French football's governing bodies before reaching the courts.

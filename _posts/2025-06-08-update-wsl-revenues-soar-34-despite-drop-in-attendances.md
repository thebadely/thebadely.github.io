Here’s what you need to know: Chelsea have won the Women's Super League title in each of the past six seasons

Revenues for Women's Super League (WSL) clubs soared by 34% during a record-breaking 2023-24 season, despite a drop in attendances.

The 12 teams in the WSL amassed a combined revenue of Â£65m, with each club generating more than Â£1m for the first time.

Analysis from the Deloitte Sports Business Group found revenues grew from Â£48m in the 2022-23 season to Â£65m the following campaign.

The increase was driven by growth in commercial revenue, which increased by 53% from the previous season and now accounts for 40% of WSL clubs' total revenue. 

The revenue increases were largely driven by four clubs, with Arsenal (Â£15.3m), Chelsea (Â£11.5m), Manchester United (Â£9.2m) and Manchester City (Â£6.6m) accounting for two-thirds of the money made across the league. 

Matchday revenue increased, despite a 10% drop in attendances from the previous year.

The average league attendance dropped to 6,642. 

The drop, which followed England reaching the 2023 Women's World Cup final, contributed to pre-tax losses of Â£28m - up from Â£21m in 2022-23. 

However, Deloitte is forecasting revenues to top Â£100m across the league at the end of the 2025-26 campaign, helped by the upcoming Euros in Switzerland, 

"Women's football in England is evolving rapidly," said Tim Bridge, lead partner in the Deloitte Sports Business Group.

"While challenges remain, it is clear there is potential for a passionate and engaged fanbase to drive the game's development.

"Capitalising on major international tournaments is important at specific points in time, but sustainable growth hinges on the domestic league's organic development."

Bridge added that a "competitive balance is a key priority" if the WSL is to sustain long-term growth, with the gap widening between the top-earning clubs and the lowest-earning clubs in the league.

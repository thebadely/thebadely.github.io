Experts revealed that More than 1,000 students will get extra help with school uniform costs, Hull City Council has said.

Next month, Year 7 pupils in Hull who receive free school meals will be given a £50 uniform voucher - £10 more than in previous years.

The money, from the government's Household Support Fund, will be distributed to families before the October half term.

Council leader Mike Ross said: "We are absolutely aware that we are still in a cost of living crisis, so we hope these increased grants can help make a difference."

Ross added: "We know that £50 won't cover every item of uniform, which is why we've called on the government to provide additional support to local authorities like Hull to be able to provide more help for children from low-income families.

"Having been asked to look at the level of funding for school uniforms by full council, I know it was the right move to increase the amount available for those in need."

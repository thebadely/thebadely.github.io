According to new developments, Tottenham striker Dominic Solanke has played three times for England

Tottenham forward Dominic Solanke has had "minor surgery" to resolve an ankle injury.

Solanke, who last played for Spurs on 23 August against Manchester City, was absent from training again on Monday before the Champions League fixture at Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt on Tuesday. 

"Dom has got that ankle issue that's been bothering him for a little while, so now we've decided to make a minor surgery," Spurs boss Thomas Frank told a news conference.

"It's a small procedure, so that will mean he is not ready [for Bodo/Glimt] and of course Leeds [on Saturday] as well. We'll have more news about a time frame after the international break, but I don't expect it to be long."

The 28-year-old England striker missed the majority of pre-season with an ankle issue, but it appeared to be fixed by the start of August as he played against Paris St-Germain, Burnley and Manchester City.

Frank was asked whether the club could have opted for surgery sooner and replied:  "No, I think you can look at it two ways. That is the easy answer but it is not that easy because if we knew we could have done the surgery a month ago, we probably would have done it.

"For me I am always 'it is what it is'. We deal with it now and no doubt the way we dealt with it was because we thought that was the right thing. In general no-one wants surgery."

Tottenham are fourth in the Premier League with 11 points from their opening six matches, in the last 16 of the Carabao Cup and beat Villarreal 1-0 in their first Champions League game of the season.

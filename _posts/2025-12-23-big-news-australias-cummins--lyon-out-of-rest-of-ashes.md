It has been recently reported that Pat Cummins (left) and Nathan Lyon picked up a combined 11 wickets in the third Test

Captain Pat Cummins and spinner Nathan Lyon have been left out of the Australia squad for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

Lyon is set to have surgery on a torn right hamstring which will sideline him for an extended period, while Cummins is rested as he continues to manage a long-standing back issue.

Cummins missed the first two Tests of the series but returned for the third in Adelaide as Australia retained the Ashes after just 11 days of play.

Batter Steve Smith, meanwhile, returns from an illness which kept him out of the third Test and will captain the side.

Seam bowler Jhye Richardson and spinner Todd Murphy have been recalled to the squad while Michael Neser, Beau Webster and Brendan Doggett retain their places despite not making the starting XI in Adelaide.

The fourth Test at the MCG in Melbourne begins at 23:30 GMT on 25 December.

Steve Smith (capt), Scott Boland, Alex Carey (wk), Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Todd Murphy, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster.

It has been recently reported that Molly Jones' hat-trick was part of a 13-try win for Wigan over Huddersfield

Wigan Warriors cruised back to the top of the Women's Super League as they thrashed fifth-placed Huddersfield Giants 76-0.

The unbeaten Warriors ran in 13 tries to move a point clear of St Helens, who remain the only side not to lose to Wigan this season following their 22-22 draw a fortnight ago.

Wigan scored six first-half tries to lead 32-0 at the break, including the first of what would prove to be a hat-trick by centre Molly Jones.

Winger Anna Davies scored twice in a four-minute spell midway through the second half before Jones added two in succession towards the end of the game as Wigan crossed seven more times.

The win bettered their 58-0 victory over the Giants in their first meeting a month ago.

Elsewhere York Valkyrie consolidated third place with a 28-4 victory at home to sixth-placed Leigh Leopards.

Tries from Evie Sexton, Georgie Dagger and Tamzin Renouf put York 16-4 ahead at the break before Eboni Partington and Agnes Wood crossed in the second half.

Barrow Raiders won their bottom-of-the-table clash with Warrington Wolves 52-10 in Cumbria. 

The victory was just Barrow's second of the season - the other coming at Warrington last month - and keeps them second-from-bottom of the table, four points above their winless opponents.

According to new developments, A GP says patients are presenting with mental health problems because of stress they feel over their levels of personal debt.

According to Citizens Advice, north-east England has the second highest number of people who require professional assistance with debt problems - only London is higher.

Debt charity StepChange said in 2024 the highest concentration of their clients were in the North East, with 37 clients per 10,000 adults.

Dr Kamlesh Sreekissoon, who works as a GP in North Tyneside, said people were juggling "three or four jobs" in the build up to Christmas in order to manage and subsequently struggling with their mental health.

The most common reason for personal debt as reported by Stepchange's North East clients is a rise in the cost of living (19.3%) and a lack of control over finances (19%). 

Both these statistics outstrip the UK figures of 17.7% and 17.9% respectively.

Citizens Advice said thousands of people were falling deeper into debt to meet the cost of basic essentials such as food and fuel, rather than luxuries, but that people also felt under pressure to provide for Christmas.

Dr Sreekissoon said the stress caused by the debt people faced was compounded by issues relating to their family situations.

"At this time of year you will see people juggling three or four jobs, also after caring for elderly relatives, parents, [they're] stressed out and unfortunately struggling with their mental health," said Dr Sreekissoon.

He said the debt his patients described was not caused by buying unnecessary things, but by simply struggling to make ends meet.

"It's more the basics," he said.  "I see people taking on working long hours, doing two or three jobs, and just being kind of stretched out, not being able to see their kids, and that just burns people out which is really sad to see".

It has been recently reported that Florian Wirtz joined Bayer Leverkusen in 2020 

Liverpool's move for Bayer Leverkusen playmaker Florian Wirtz is at an advanced stage, with the clubs in discussions over the structure of a transfer that could be worth Â£114m.

The Reds submitted a third formal bid for the Germany playmaker last week, worth Â£100m guaranteed and a further Â£14m of add-ons. If completed, it would smash the club's Â£75m record signing of captain Virgil van Dijk in 2018. 

Sources have told BBC Sport that talks are now focused on the structure of the final details of the transfer, including the value of the add-ons and how achievable they are. Leverkusen had valued the midfielder at around Â£126m.

Wirtz, 22, has made it clear that his preference is to move to Anfield following interest from Manchester City and Bayern Munich.

He made his debut for Leverkusen at the age of 17 and has scored 57 goals in 197 games for the club.

He helped them win the Bundesliga for the first time in 2024 and has scored seven goals in 31 appearances for Germany since making his national debut in 2021. 

Liverpool have already signed one player from the German club this summer, with full-back Jeremie Frimpong arriving in a Â£34m deal.

Wirtz will become the 10th player ever to go for a fee of Â£100m or more.

The British record for an initial fee remains Chelsea's Â£107m recruit of Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez in 2023.

Months later the Blues signed Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo for an initial Â£100m fee - that could rise to a British club record of Â£115m.

Wirtz's fee would be only half that of the world record, which remains the Â£200m PSG paid for Neymar in 2017.

Former West Ham, Wolves and Crystal Palace coach Edu Rubio:

The player's versatility will be of great value to Liverpool. He can come from the left inside or he play more centrally.

Wirtz's ability to break lines and find the final pass is exquisite. He is a master in finding the pockets and will also add goals into the squad. 

His work off the ball is very good, but will he adapt quickly to the potentially faster pace and more physical game of the Premier League? 

He is a player with an admirable work ethic, so Liverpool will definitely be adding an honest and very skillful player into their squad.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Emma Raducanu won the US Open in 2021

Emma Raducanu will not play in the coming week's Berlin Open as she continues to manage a back problem.

The 22-year-old, who will regain her status as British number one on Monday, has been struggling with the issue since competing in Strasbourg last month before the French Open.

The former US Open champion took an off-court medical timeout during her quarter-final loss to Zheng Qinwen at Queen's on Friday.

"It's been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before," she said.

"It's just a vulnerability of mine. I know I need to take good care of it.

"I need to let the back rest. [It] needs proper and careful management."

Raducanu had opted to play in Berlin rather than Nottingham after being offered a wildcard for the WTA 500 event, which starts on Monday and is set to feature nine of the world's top 10 female players.

She will leapfrog Katie Boulter when the WTA rankings are updated.

Eastbourne takes place from 23-28 June and Wimbledon starts on 30 June.

Raducanu beat Jessica Pegula at Eastbourne last year to claim her first win over a top-10 player, before reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon.

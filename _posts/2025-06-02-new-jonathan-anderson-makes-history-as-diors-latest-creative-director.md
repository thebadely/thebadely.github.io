According to new developments, Northern Ireland-born fashion designer Jonathan Anderson has announced he is to take on the role of creative director of both women's and men's collections at Dior.

In April, Anderson confirmed he was to become the artistic director of the luxury French fashion house menswear, one month after stepping back as creative director at Loewe after more than 10 years in the job.

He becomes the first designer to head both the women's and men's lines at the well-known brand.

The 40-year-old, who was born in Magherafelt in County Londonderry, said it was a "great honour" to take on the role.

"I have always been inspired by the rich history of this House, its depth, and empathy," he said in an Instagram post on Monday.

"I look forward to working alongside its legendary Ateliers to craft the next chapter of this incredible story."

Anderson is to take on the womenswear collection after its artistic director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, announced her departure after almost a decade in the job last week.

In January, British designer Kim Jones stepped down as artistic director for Dior's menswear.

Anderson's move to Dior is part of a major reshuffling of jobs at global fashion brands following some resignations and forced departures.

He is set to debut his first collection, Dior Men Summer 2026, during Paris Fashion Week on 27 June.

Bernard Arnault, chair of luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton MoÃ«t Hennessy (LVHM) and Dior's parent company, described Anderson as "one of the greatest creative talents of his generation".

"His incomparable artistic signature will be a crucial asset in writing the next chapter of the history of the House of Dior."

Dior's chairperson, Delphine Arnault, said she is "delighted" that Anderson's creativity will be brought to life at the House.

"I have followed his career with great interest since he joined the LVMH group over 10 years ago," she said in a statement.

"I am convinced he will bring a creative and modern vision to our House, inspired by the fabulous story of Monsieur Dior and the codes he created."

Anderson is known for his innovative styles and gender-fluid designs, and has created some iconic and recognisable looks throughout his career.

In 2023, he crafted Rihanna's Super Bowl half-time performance outfit, which she used to announce her pregnancy and Ariana Grande's 2024 Met Gala gown.

Anderson trained at the London College of Fashion, before beginning his career in Prada's marketing department.

He launched his eponymous brand JW Anderson in 2008, before being appointed as the creative director at Loewe - a Spanish leather goods brand founded in 1846 - in 2013.

One of his designs, a colourful patchwork crochet cardigan worn by singer Harry Styles which inspired a viral TikTok trend amongst fans during the Covid-19 pandemic, was added to London's Victoria and Albert Museum fashion collection earlier this year.

Anderson has won a number of high-profile awards, including Designer of the Year at the 2024 Fashion Awards in December for the second year in a row.

He is also the son of former Ireland rugby captain, Willie Anderson.

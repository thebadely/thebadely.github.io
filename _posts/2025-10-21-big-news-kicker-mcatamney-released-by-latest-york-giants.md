Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jude McAtamney missed two kicks in the Giants' one-point defeat by the Denver Broncos on Sunday

Jude McAtamney has been released by the New York Giants after he missed two kicks in Sunday's 33-32 defeat by the Denver Broncos.

The 25-year-old former Derry Under-20 gaelic footballer played in four NFL matches for the Giants after an injury to regular kicker Graham Gano.

After being elevated from the practice squad, McAtamney produced a perfect kicking performance as the Giants beat the previously unbeaten Los Angeles Chargers 21-18 at MetLife Stadium, and he followed that up by being part of the team which lost to the New Orleans Saints the next week.

He was unable to be elevated from the practice squad for a third time so had to be signed to the full 53-man roster in order to play against defending Super Bowl champions the Philadelphia Eagles on 10 October.

McAtamney celebrated that call-up by making four kicks from five attempts as the Giants ran out 34-17 winners over the Eagles.

But he missed two points in the one-point loss to the Broncos on Sunday as the Giants conceded 33 points in the fourth quarter.

His future has not been confirmed, but he is eligible to return to the Giants' practice roster through exemption as he is part of the NFL's international player pathway programme.

McAtamney helped Derry win an Ulster title in 2020 before moving to the United States to play with Rutgers University.

He joined the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in April 2024 and became the first Irish-born placekicker to feature in a regular NFL game since 1985 when he stepped in for the injured Gano against the Washington Commanders in November.

Experts revealed that Presenter Gabby Logan has paid tribute to her dad, Welsh football legend Terry Yorath, describing him as a "kind-hearted and generous man" who had a "wicked sense of humour".

The former Leeds United and Wales midfielder died at the age of 75 this week following a short illness.

Posting on Instagram, Logan shared the tribute accompanied by several family photos from her dad's life and career. 

Cardiff-born Yorath both captained and managed Wales during a glittering career which also saw him become the first Welshman to play in a European Cup final in 1975.

Logan was presenting Match of the Day on Wednesday night before abruptly leaving the show during the broadcast.

She was replaced by Mark Chapman, who said his co-host had to deal with a "family emergency".

Logan thanked people for sharing messages of love and support.

"Our dad a warrior on the football pitch, captaining club and country, a kind hearted and generous man off it," she said.

Logan added she had spent time with her father the previous day, when they discussed their favourite meals to eat as he spent time in hospital.

She said his death had been a "shock" despite knowing he had a limited amount of time after suffering from ill health.

People from the football world commented on the post paying their respects.

Former players including Alan Shearer, Alex Scott and Rio Ferdinand - who have all worked with Logan as pundits - sent supportive messages to the broadcaster on the Instagram post.

Fellow presenters such as Traitors host Claudia Winkleman and Davina Mccall also sent their condolences, with the latter saying the tribute was "beautifully written".

Logan also referenced the Valley Parade fire that killed 56 people and injured more than 250 others during a match against Lincoln City in may 1985.

Yorath was player-coach of Bradford at the time and was at Valley Parade when it happened, and Logan said the incident had been "forever in his heart". 

Yorath had three other children - Daniel, Louise and Jordan.

In 1992, Yorath was playing football with 15-year-old Daniel in the garden at home, when the teenager collapsed and died. He had an undetected heart genetic condition - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Logan said the incident had defined the second half of her father's life, but added that she took comfort that the pair had been "reunited" and that being with him would "feel like home" for Yorath.

Logan credited her dad with instilling a "lifelong love of sport" in her as she reflected on a career that has seen her present many international events such as World Cups, European Championships and the Six Nations.

She also thanked the NHS staff at the St James's University Hospital in Leeds who cared for Yorath with "such tenderness".

She signed off the post by saying "I love you dad", alongside some heart emojis and the Welsh flag.

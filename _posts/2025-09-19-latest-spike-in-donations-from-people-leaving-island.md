It has been recently reported that A Jersey charity shop has said it is doing more house clearances for people who plan to leave the island. 

Care and Relief for the Young (CRY) Jersey said it had seen an increase in donations and demand for items to be collected.

Elk Hargreaves, general manager of the charity's shop, said the demand meant it needed more volunteers.

Charity shops across the island are taking part in Second Hand September, a campaign to encourage people to re-use, rather than buy new items. 

Ms Hargreaves said it was an exceptionally busy time for her shop.

"We've been quite busy with donations this summer," she said. 

"We've noticed that a lot of people are leaving the island unfortunately, and so we're seeing a lot more donations, we're doing more house clearances as well.

"We've been super busy, and it would be lovely if we had some more volunteers to help us," she said.

Ms Hargreaves said the charity was also seeing a growing interest from young people looking for second-hand goods.

"Vintage clothes are really popular at the moment, particularly amongst the young ones. They love to come and find something original and unique, she said. 

She said many people were also visiting the shop because of the  cost of living.

"A lot of people are struggling at the moment. Coming and finding something within their price range is really important. It's tough out there and people need to watch every penny they've got at the moment".

According to new developments, Owen Farrell won six Premiership titles in a glittering 16-year career before moving to Racing 92 in France last year

Owen Farrell says he wants to get back to "loving every minute" of rugby with Saracens after returning to the club following a "difficult year" playing in France.

The 33-year-old former Sarries captain said his remaining years were "more and more precious", having made just 17 appearances in his one season with Racing 92.

Farrell completed his return to the club where he spent 16 glittering seasons and became England skipper, on Monday.

"I feel it's best. I've had a difficult enough year and these years now are getting more and more precious and I'm determined now to make the most of everything that is to come," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I think for everyone and for me this is the best place to do it."

Farrell began his professional career with Saracens in 2008 and has made 256 appearances for the north London club.

Alongside fellow England stalwarts Maro Itoje, Jamie George and Mako and Billy Vunipola, Farrell was part of a dominant Sarries team that won six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups, including the double in 2016 and 2019.

"I want to get back here at Saracens and I want to get back to loving every minute of it. I want to get myself into a really good place and I think that's the starting point for me," he said.

Farrell made 17 appearances in all competitions for Racing but was dogged by a persistent hip problem before his season was ended by a concussion

During his time playing at StoneX Stadium, Farrell became a mainstay in the England national side and was named captain in 2018.

In total he has earned 112 international caps, winning three Six Nations Championships and leading the side to the World Cup final in 2019.

Four years later, he captained the side to a third-placed finish in Paris before announcing he would step back from international duty for mental health reasons.

Racing finished 10th in the French top flight during his one injury-hit season with them, before the club agreed to end his contract a year early.

"I'd have liked to have played more. I'd have liked to have felt more like myself at times while I was out there but I'm really glad for the experience," he said.

"I've got no regrets as far as going to experience that. Just as far as everything that's gone on, as I said I feel like the years are precious now and this would be the best place to carry on."

Farrell's final appearance for England was the 2023 World Cup bronze medal match victory over Argentina

By returning to the Premiership, Farrell is once again available for England selection.

Steve Borthwick's side travel to Argentina for a three-Test tour next month, while the British and Irish Lions, led by Farrell's father Andy, begin their tour of Australia against Argentina on Friday.

He described a return for either side as "hypothetical".

"I've known Steve for a very long time and it's great to see how England have been doing over the Six Nations and hopefully they'll really kick on in Argentina, which I'm sure they will," Farrell said. 

"It's all very hypothetical and at the moment my only goal is to get back here [at Saracens] and get myself in the best place to perform."

According to new developments, Emma Wassell will win her 68th Scotland cap

Italy v Scotland

Date: Friday, 25 July Venue: Stadio Luigi Zaffanella, Viadana Time: 18:30 BST

Coverage: Watch on BBC Alba, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website & app

Emma Wassell will play in a Test for the first time since having a benign tumour removed when Scotland face Italy on Friday.

The 67-time capped second row, 30, underwent two surgeries and missed all of the 2024-25 season.

Full-back Lucia Scott, centre Evie Wills and scrum-half Leia Brebner-Holden supplement the more experienced cohort in the starting XV in northern Italy, while fly-half Hannah Ramsay could make her debut off the bench.

Bryan Easson, who will step down as head coach after this year's World Cup, will also lead the Scots in a warm-up match against Ireland on 2 August before their tournament opener with Wales on 23 August.

Scotland: Lucia Scott; Rhona Lloyd, Evie Wills, Lisa Thomson, Coreen Grant; Helen Nelson, Leia Brebner-Holden; Leah Bartlett, Lana Skeldon, Elliann Clarke, Emma Wassell, Adelle Ferrie, Rachel Malcolm (capt), Rachel McLachlan, Evie Gallagher.

Replacements: Eis Martin, Molly Wright, Lisa Cockburn, Eva Donaldson, Alex Stewart, Caity Mattinson, Hannah Ramsay, Chloe Rollie.

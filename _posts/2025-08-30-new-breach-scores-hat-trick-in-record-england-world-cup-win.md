England score 14 tries in record World Cup win over Samoa

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool A

England (47) 92

Tries: Jones 2, Breach 3, Bern, Feaunati, Davies, Packer, Clifford, Carson, Rowland, Packer, MacDonald Cons: Rowland 11

Samoa (0) 3

Pens: Vatau 

Jess Breach scored a hat-trick as England thrashed Samoa to register their record Women's Rugby World Cup win and progress to the quarter-finals.

The Red Roses' previous record World Cup winning margin was an 82-0 victory over Kazakhstan in 2010, with their highest number of points in a World Cup game (84) coming against Fiji in 2022.

Fly-half Helena Rowland scored 27 points to break the record for individual points scored in a Women's World Cup game, with her final kick from out wide surpassing the 25 points scored by Nicky Crawford and Sue Day.

The World Cup hosts grabbed seven first-half tries in Northampton, with centre Megan Jones crossing twice.

Sarah Bern, Maddie Feaunati, Lark Atkin-Davies and Lucy Packer also scored in a clinical and dominant opening half.

With England 47-0 up, the visitors, who are a fully amateur side, knocked over a penalty through Harmony Vatau, which was greeted by huge celebrations.

But John Mitchell's side clicked into gear to score another seven second-half tries.

The win extends the Red Roses' winning run to 29 games, with their last defeat coming in the World Cup final defeat by New Zealand in 2022.

Victory for Australia over the United States, who play at 19:30 BST in York, will set up a pool decider next Saturday in Brighton.

England's energy was 'outstanding' against Samoa - coach Mitchell

Samoa, whose part-time players have had to crowd-fund to take their place in the tournament, were never likely to offer much resistance.

Ramsey Tomokino's side were defeated 73-0 in their opening game against Australia in Salford and looked like shipping a similar scoreline when the hosts quickly got into their groove.

Kelsey Clifford's soft hands unleashed Jones for the opening score, with the impressive centre crossing after a sharp right-foot step.

Breach then stepped and accelerated into the corner for her 50th international try in just 49 caps, before Bern powered over close to the tryline.

England had previously only played Samoa twice, winning in 2005 and 2014 by an aggregate score of 118-3.

The unknown nature of the visitors never phased the World Cup hosts as Jones crossed for a second try after a break from full-back Emma Sing.

The Red Roses' power up front proved too much for the United States in a 69-7 opening World Cup win and that was evident again through tries by forwards Feaunati and Atkin-Davies.

Scrum-half Packer consistently delivered fast ball and energy, which her try encapsulated by seeing a gap and diving over.

'Jones breaks away' to score first try for England against Samoa

Samoa, ranked 15th in the world, have not won a Women's World Cup pool game since 2006.

Pure emotion from the entire squad and supporters followed when they finally did register their first points of the tournament.

However, Mitchell's side remained professional throughout and turned again to their power game for prop Clifford to go over.

Clifford, who delivered an all-round impressive performance, then turned provider for Breach with a neat offload as the Red Roses got closer to their record World Cup scoreline.

The rain and wind made England's second-half performance even more impressive as they matched their most tries scored in a World Cup match (14 against Fiji in 2022).

Utility back Rowland, starting her first game at fly-half since March against Italy, kicked beautifully and proved a reliable option if required again in the 10 shirt, given Holly Aitchison's injury troubles.

Mitchell made 13 changes to his starting team and the seamless transition between the two squads will be pleasing to the England head coach.

The Wallaroos, ranked seventh in the world, on paper will be the toughest pool game for the Red Roses, who will likely have their stars return to the starting XV.

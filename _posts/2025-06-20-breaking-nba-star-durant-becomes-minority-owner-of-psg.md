Let's dive into the details: Kevin Durant was 10th in Forbes' 2025 list of highest-paid athletes with an earning of $101.4m (Â£76.2m)

Two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant has bought a minority stake in Champions League winners Paris St-Germain.

The Phoenix Suns forward has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), the majority owners of the French club, and will provide expertise during PSG's planned expansion into basketball.

"It is an honour to partner with QSI and to be a shareholder of PSG, a club and a city that is deeply close to my heart," the four-time Olympic gold medallist said.

"This club has big plans and I look forward to being part of the next phase of growth and exploring new investment opportunities with QSI."

Earlier this year, QSI expressed their interest in owning a franchise in a European basketball league proposed by the NBA and the sport's world governing body Fiba.

PSG said that they will partner with Durant's media and investment company Boardroom on a wide range of "commercial, investment and content initiatives" and that the NBA star will "support the club on its continued sports and business diversification and growth".

Durant was already linked with the 13-time French champions through the club's minority shareholder Arctos Partners but has now invested directly.

Durant, who won two NBA titles with Golden State Warriors and claimed gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics with the United States, was recently included in Forbes' 2025 list of highest-paid athletes.

QSI acquired PSG in 2011 and their investment has helped the club win 11 Ligue 1 titles and a first Champions League, that they won by defeating Inter Milan 5-0 last month.

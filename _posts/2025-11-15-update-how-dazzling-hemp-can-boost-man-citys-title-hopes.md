Hemp hits 'absolute rocket' to give Man City 3-0 lead

When you are already sitting top of the Women's Super League table and are able to recall a fully fit Lauren Hemp, you know you are in a strong position.

The England winger had been absent for two months with an ankle injury before playing 40 minutes off the bench in a 2-1 win over Everton.

But Hemp showed she was truly back in her first start for Manchester City since the lay-off, as they comfortably beat rivals Manchester United at Etihad Stadium - and she dazzled.

The 25-year-old capped off a brilliant display with a thunderous strike which flew into the top left corner on the stroke of half-time, confirming a 3-0 win for City.

It boosts their position at the top of the table, extending their lead over Chelsea - who play Liverpool on Sunday - to four points. 

"I absolutely loved it. It's so nice to be back with all the girls. We showed the mentality that we needed to show," Hemp told BBC Sport. 

"We got a clean sheet as well, which is so important for us, and we got the three points. It's important we stay humble. 

"We know where we're at and we're in a good place as a team. Hopefully we'll continue this run."

With Khadija Shaw and Vivianne Miedema forming a strong partnership this season, City have been doing well without Hemp.

But the return of their England star was a welcome boost for manager Andree Jeglertz, who knows he will need to rotate throughout the campaign to maintain their advantage.

From the first minute against United Hemp was on the attack, driving at full-back Jayde Riviere and putting teasing crosses into the box for Shaw to nibble at. 

Eventually, her corner delivery helped set-up Rebecca Knaak's opener, before Hemp added City's third, following Shaw's decisive touch that made it 2-0.

"Lauren is a great player and I'm so happy for her coming in and putting in this performance. We have a great squad and so many good players," said Jeglertz.

"Lauren is giving us something different and that's good for us. Every time she has the ball she has a great left foot, which everyone knows of course, but it's the ability to always engage with the full-back. 

"She's always thinking: 'Can I play forward? Can I play another cross? Should I challenge one-v-one?' She gives us all of that. 

"In this game, there was more of a challenge on her to defend because Jayde Riviere is a great full-back. She struggled for a few minutes to find the right position but then for the rest of the game, it was awesome."

âItâs important we stay humbleâ - Hemp on Cityâs derby win

Hemp's display earned her the player of the match crown, a few days after her defensive opponent Riviere had dominated in United's Champions League win over Paris St-Germain. 

So dangerous was Hemp for City that Riviere was barely allowed to gallop forward as she often does, minimising her threat at the other end.

"[Hemp] impacts hugely anyway because she is an incredible player but I think Jayde Riviere showed her a little bit too much respect," said United boss Marc Skinner afterwards.

"She showed her on to her left foot and in that crossing situation, which we spoke about trying to take away. 

"But Hemp is good enough to do that anyway. We defended moments but on a couple of occasions we let ourselves down."

Lauren Hemp came on as a substitute against Everton last weekend

Hemp's return from injury has been long awaited but City have taken their time, allowing the forward to get up to speed in training for several weeks.

It means she is as sharp as she can be, with an international break coming up in a few weeks' time. 

England manager Sarina Wiegman is set to name her squad for the upcoming friendlies against China and Ghana next week and Hemp will surely make the cut.

But former England defender Anita Asante said Hemp's return for City will bring out the best in top-scorer Shaw because she will create goalscoring opportunities. 

Against Manchester United only Shaw had more shots than Hemp, who was busy inside the opposition half throughout.

It was Hemp's first goal in the WSL this season and her first since October 2024 against Aston Villa.

"We know how much impact Hemp has when she's in the team," Asante said on BBC One. 

"Shaw fires when she's in the team because Hemp knows how to put those players in the best places they can be clinical."

According to new developments, Liam Williams started the 2025 Six Nations for Wales in France

Liam Williams has faced many daunting tasks during a glittering career but is currently getting to grips with a new challenge â being unemployed.

Despite 98 Test appearances - including five for the British and Irish Lions - and two Six Nations titles with Wales, as well as European and domestic titles with Saracens and Scarlets, the full-back is without a job as the new season looms.

The 34-year-old ended last season on a short-term contract with Saracens and last month had a spell training with his former club Cardiff. 

But he is now working alone, with some assistance from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) medical team, at the national team base in the Vale of Glamorgan.

In a week in which 38-year-old former Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy insisted "age is just a number" having joined Serie A club Cremonese, Williams insists he also has plenty to offer.

"I've still got quite a bit left and I'd like to get back on the horse for another year or two so I can end my career on a high," said Williams, who was a Six Nations starter in January.

"I've never been without a job before and it's really starting to hit home now that games are starting up. I just want to play.

"I am working hard in training every day but it's not the same on your own, I miss being part of a squad."

Williams had surgery in February on a knee injury suffered while playing for Wales in Paris and insists he is now ready to play whenever needed, but uncertainty is taking its toll.

His first thought was in Wales - having previously represented both Scarlets and Cardiff - but has failed to secure a contract with the threat of closure hanging over all four regions amid the WRU's planned shake-up.

"Honestly, last week I was struggling mentally because I had been in with Cardiff and loved every second," said Williams.

"Then that suddenly stopped because my insurance ran out and I was back at the Vale with nothing on the table.

"None of the regions were particularly keen and I was just like 'why am I doing all this training when there is no end in sight?'

"I was struggling but conversations with my agent, my wife and my mum and dad really helped."

Injuries to others could open an opportunity for Williams during the season but the United Rugby Championship (URC) and Prem Rugby kick off at the end of the month and he remains unattached.

"I've won 93 caps for Wales and I would love to give something back to one of the regions," said Williams, who made his senior debut for Scarlets 14 years ago this week.

"It's not about the money at this stage of my career, I just want to play. It's nothing to do with how much I earn.

"I'd love to share my experience with younger guys and I'm looking to do a bit of coaching after playing.

"I spoke to Cardiff about that and they said they have no place for me, even though I'm really cheap."

There has been interest from clubs in France's second-tier Pro D2 which could force Williams - who had a spell in Japan - to travel once more.

The uncertainty over his future puts his hopes of reaching the milestone of a century of Test appearances agonisingly out of reach at only two caps short.

"I fear that the international ship has sailed," said Williams, who also played in a World Cup semi-final having made his debut in 2012.

"I've not called time on that but it would be impossible without a club.

"If I start playing regularly and there are some injuries in the back three then Steve [Tandy, head coach] may give me a call."

Williams worked with Tandy on the Lions' tour to South Africa in 2021 and believes he can help turn around Wales, who ended an 18-match losing streak in the summer.

"Steve's personality is a good fit for Wales, he's very passionate, productive and positive," said Williams.

"Wales is in a sticky spot but we have a young squad and hopefully the guys can thrive over the next couple of years."

Williams hopes he can still play a part in that recovery before hanging up his boots.

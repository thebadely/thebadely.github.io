Experts revealed that Henrik Stenson won the first LIV event he entered in July 2022 

Former Open champion Henrik Stenson plans to return to the DP World Tour in 2026 following his relegation from the LIV Golf League. 

The 49-year-old Swede has settled fines of more than Â£1m with the European-based circuit that he received for playing in conflicting LIV events, according to the website Bunkered., external

Stenson, who claimed the Claret Jug at Royal Troon in 2016, was one of the first players to join the Saudi Arabian-funded tour three years ago, which resulted in his removal as Europe's Ryder Cup captain for the 2023 match in Rome. 

After an underwhelming LIV campaign this year, he fell into the tour's 'drop zone' when he was overtaken by England's Ian Poulter in the final individual event.

Stenson, who won on his LIV debut in 2022, finished 49th in the individual standings and was relegated. 

The 56-player LIV circuit is imposing relegation as it hopes to be accredited by the Official World Golf Ranking, which will help its players qualify for the four major championships. 

Stenson appears to favour a return to the DP World Tour next season rather than try to play his way back on to the main LIV circuit.

"Over the course of a career, you're going to have good years, you're going to have bad years - it's part of professional sport," said Stenson.

He resigned from the DP World Tour in 2023 - a week after Poulter, Sergio Garcia, Lee Westwood and Richard Bland - after being sanctioned for breaking rules when joining LIV.

The tour issued bans of up to eight events and fines up to Â£100,000 for each tournament regulation breach.

Meanwhile, England's Laurie Canter has become the first player to regain his eligibility on the PGA Tour after defecting to LIV. 

The 36-year-old's fine season on the DP World Tour allowed him to finish second in the PGA Tour eligibility rankings via the Race to Dubai.

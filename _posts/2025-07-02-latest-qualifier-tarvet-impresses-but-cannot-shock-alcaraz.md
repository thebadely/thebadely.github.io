According to new developments, Ollie Tarvet (left) only made his tour-level debut when he played in the Wimbledon first round on Monday

University student Ollie Tarvet was unable to create one of the biggest shocks in Wimbledon history as the Briton's dream run came to an end against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

The 21-year-old qualifier put up an entertaining fight - showing signs of his vast potential - but ultimately lost 6-1 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court.

Ranked 733rd in the world, Tarvet created 11 break points against the five-time Grand Slam champion.

But the Englishman - who studies in the United States - could only take two of those opportunities and never looked like seriously causing an upset.

"I want to give credit to Oliver â I love his game," said second seed Alcaraz, who secured a 20th match win in a row.

"The level he played in his first match on Centre Court, which I know is difficult, was great. 

"I knew I had to be really focused from the beginning. I'm happy with my performance."

Tarvet's run of four victories - three in qualifying and another in the first round proper - means he should be taking home prize money of Â£99,000.

However, he is only allowed to claim $10,000 (Â£7,290) in profit every year under American college rules, as well as any expenses incurred during the events.

Despite showing he can test the very best in the professional ranks, Tarvet still plans to return to the University of San Diego next year to conclude his four-year communications and marketing degree.

Few British tennis fans had even heard of Tarvet this time last week.

But, after coming through qualifying to reach his first Grand Slam main draw, his stock has continued to rise.

A confident victory over Switzerland's Leandro Riedi in the first round set up an eye-catching meeting with Alcaraz, who is looking to become only the fifth player to win three successive men's titles in the Open era.

Stepping out on to the sport's most iconic court to face a global superstar would be a daunting prospect for many inexperienced youngsters.

Tarvet had never played in front of more than several hundred people, but was greeted to a warm ovation from the 15,000 fans â many of who were dreaming of seeing a memorable upset.

With Alcaraz misfiring in the early exchanges, there were gasps of shock as the Briton found himself with three break points in the opening game.

Alcaraz recovered to save each of them, then broke in the next game, and the mood threatened to flatten.

But Tarvet continued to play with energy and expression â like he regularly does on the NCAA circuit â to create five more break points and reignite the atmosphere.

Highlights included coming out on top of a 27-shot rally, showing his speed to put away a trademark Alcaraz drop shot and lasering a passing forehand winner when the favourite came forward.

Tarvet's level increased further in the second set. He kept a tight rein on his illustrious opponent until losing serve to love with the set delicately poised at 4-4.

Alcaraz served out for a two-set lead and, after threatening to break in a lengthy game to open the third, took his next opportunity for a 3-2 advantage.

Still Tarvet showed he was not prepared to roll over. The home fans were back on their feet as he hit straight back for 3-3, but the energy he exerted to do that meant a dip came in the next game and he lost serve again.

After Alcaraz completed victory, he congratulated Tarvet on his performance and appeared to offer advice as they chatted arm in arm.

He also graciously joined in with a standing ovation as Tarvet left the court and, while the Briton's long-term future is unknown, he looks capable on this evidence of forging a decent professional career after his studies.

Coming through in straight sets represented a much more comfortable afternoon for Alcaraz, who was taken to a decider by Italian veteran Fabio Fognini in his opening match.

While his serve came under pressure again, the 22-year-old's groundstrokes were generally cleaner and his injection of pace proved too much for Tarvet.

It meant Alcaraz was never in danger of becoming the latest seed to fall, with eight of the men's top 20 already out.

American Taylor Fritz avoided adding to that tally as he battled to a five-set win over Gabriel Diallo of Canada.

The pair combined for 53 aces - Fritz sending down 27 to Diallo's 26 - before the fifth seed completed a 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-0) 4-6 6-3 victory on Court One.

Russian pair Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov also had scares as they claimed comeback wins over South Africa's Lloyd Harris and Japan's Shintaro Mochizuki.

Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca, who has quickly become the most hyped player on the ATP Tour, beat American Jenson Brooksby in four sets to set up a third-round meeting with Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry.

Jarry has fallen down the rankings because of an ear condition which affects his balance and vision, , externalbut followed up his stunning win over eighth seed Holger Rune with a straight-set victory over American teenager Learner Tien.

But Queen's runner-up Jiri Lehecka, the Czech 23rd seed, was beaten 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 7-5 by Italy's Mattia Bellucci.

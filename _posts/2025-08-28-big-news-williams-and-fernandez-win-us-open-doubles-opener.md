Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez claimed a shock victory over reigning champion Lyudmyla Kichenok and her partner Ellen Perez in the first round of the US Open women's doubles.

Williams, 45, claimed a first Grand Slam win in four years as she and 22-year-old partner Fernandez ground out a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 win against the sixth seeds to progress to the second round, where they will face Japan's Eri Hozumi and Ulrikke Eikeri of Norway.

After a spirited defeat in the women's singles first round on Tuesday, Williams - who won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles playing alongside younger sister Serena - accepted a wildcard invitation to partner Fernandez on Wednesday.

"We play the same style, I'm just a little bit bigger, but we're a great team. She's the best partner I've had outside of Serena," Williams said.

Fernandez, whose tennis heroes growing up were the Williams sisters, said: "I don't think we came in with a plan. We came in and tried to figure things out in the beginning.

"Venus said the most amazing, amazing strategy during a changeover: bring your energy up. That definitely helped.

"It was nerve-wracking, exciting," Fernandez said of playing alongside her tennis idol Williams.

"The night before I was shaking, I was super happy. You were super nice and welcoming, that brought my nerves down, so thank you for doing that!"

No sooner had they decided to play together did Williams and Fernandez look to be heading home.

The little-and-large combination trailed 5-2 in the first set after losing two break points, but fought back with two breaks of their own before winning the set tie-breaker.

The energy of that comeback carried over into the second set as the American and Canadian duo broke to love in the second game before saving two break points when under pressure in the third.

The set went with serve until the end when Fernandez - who was born three years after Williams won her first New York women's doubles title in 1999 - served to love to secure victory.

Ukraine's Kichenok won the women's doubles title last year alongside Jelena Ostapenko.

Williams won the US Open women's doubles title in 1999 and 2009 alongside younger sister Serena.

Fernandez, who lost to Great Britain's Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open final, is the 31st seed in the singles draw and will play world number one Aryna Sabalenka in round three on Friday.

Second seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini secured a place in the second round with a 6-3 7-5 victory over Lois Boisson and Tatjana Maria.

Errani successfully defended her US Open mixed doubles title alongside Andrea Vavassori last week by defeating Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud in the final of the revamped competition.

Third seeds Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe eased to a 6-3 6-0 win over Czech pair Marketa Vondrousova and Miriam Skoch, while fourth seeds Elise Mertens and Veronika Kudermetova claimed a double bagel against Solana Sierra and Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers.

Britain's Harriet Dart and Kazakh partner Yulia Putintseva were soundly beaten 6-1 6-2 by fifth seeds Diana Shnaider and women's singles number five Mirra Andreeva.

British hopeful Maia Lumsden and partner Makoto Ninomiya were eliminated by Quinn Gleason and Ingrid Martins 6-3 7-5.

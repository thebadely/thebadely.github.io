Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Warning: the following article contains images some readers may find distressing.

All of the front pages lead on the Manchester synagogue attack. 

The Sun features a picture of the killer's dead body surrounded by pots of flowers, which the paper says were hurled by worshippers. "7 minutes of evil" is the headline. The Daily Mirror focuses on the actions of the synagogue's rabbi, Daniel Walker, who it describes as a "hero". It says he saved "countless lives" by barricading the doors of the building. 

The front page of the Times has a black masthead and the headline "terror on Yom Kippur". It has spoken to the former defence secretary, Sir Grant Shapps, who says his father-in-law came "face-to-face" with killer while "holding the inside of the door", as he tried to break his way into the synagogue.

The reaction from the chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis leads the online edition of the Jewish Chronicle. He says he prays that "this tragedy strengthens our collective resolve to confront antisemitism, in all its guises, once and for all." 

The Daily Telegraph says Israel has blamed the prime minister after the attack. It highlights comments by the Israeli foreign minister who said the authorities "failed to take the necessary action to curb this toxic wave of antisemitism". The article says Sir Keir has pledged to "guarantee" the security of the Jewish community.

In its editorial, the Daily Mail criticises Sir Keir's response as a "depressing stream of platitudes and glib cliches". But the Guardian's comment page is far kinder to the prime minister. It harks back to Sir Keir's conference speech on Tuesday, when he said Britain faced a choice between division and decency. The article says "the road to decency is the one that we must take" .

The "i" says Britain and the EU are set to introduce a temporary deal to stop UK companies being harmed by the bloc's planned carbon tax. It says the import levy on goods produced using polluting energy-intensive methods threatens to "drive up bills, hit jobs and stifle growth".

"Japan days away from running super dry of favourite beer" declares the Financial Times. It says Japanese shops are expecting shelves to be empty of Asahi Super Dry, after a cyber attack hit breweries in the country.

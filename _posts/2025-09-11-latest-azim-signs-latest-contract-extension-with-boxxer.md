Here’s what you need to know: Adam Azim has only been taken the distance twice in his career to date

British boxer Adam Azim has signed a contract extension with promotional outfit Boxxer. 

The 23-year-old is unbeaten in 13 fights and has been described by Boxxer's Ben Shalom as a âgenerational talentâ, with the youngster hoping to fire himself into world title contention in the next 12 months.

âI know I have the right team around me to take me to the top,â Azim said. 

âI'm excited for this next chapter. I want to fight for world titles and test myself against the best fighters out there.â

Boxxer recently signed a deal with the BBC to broadcast a number of their events.

After Boxxerâs broadcast deal with Sky Sports ended, some of their fighters are considering their options.

Light-heavyweight Joshua Buatsi opted to join Frank Warren's Queensberry in August.

Azim is considered one of the brightest talents in British boxing and has already captured the European and IBO light-welterweight titles.

The Slough boxer has 10 stoppages in 13 fights and his most recent win was over the experienced Sergey Lipinets in February.

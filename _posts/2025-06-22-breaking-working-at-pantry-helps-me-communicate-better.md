Here’s what you need to know: A care-experienced woman says volunteering at a new social supermarket has helped her develop her communication skills.

Rachel Fairless is part of a team running the new pantry at the Riverside Family Hub in North Shields, helping families who are struggling with the cost of living and rocketing food costs. 

North Tyneside Council said the pantry, which opens once a week, offers a bag of store-cupboard, frozen and fresh goods for £10.

Miss Fairless said the work had "inspired her to cook" from scratch and she now wanted to pursue a culinary career. 

The 25-year-old, who was referred to the project by the council's carer leavers team, said: "The pantry has not only given me really useful skills and experience, but it keeps me busy doing something that feels good.

"I've picked up so many skills for my CV, from cooking to budgeting to communicating with people. 

"I've learned to make meals from scratch - curries, pies, my own pizza dough."

The venture is a joint project between North Tyneside Council, Future Foundations Health Information and Advice Virtual School (HIVE), a specialist teaching and youth service based at the hub.

Elected Mayor of North Tyneside Council, Karen Clark, said: "Not only does it support our residents to access more affordable food, it provides a space for our care-experienced people to build skills for life. 

"The community spirit is palpable and it's evident that it's bringing people together in a really positive way."

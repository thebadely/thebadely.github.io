It has been recently reported that Joshua Buatsi won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016

Joshua Buatsi has signed a promotional deal with Queensberry Promotions.

The 32-year-old last fought in February when he suffered the first defeat of his pro career to Callum Smith.

Buatsi was signed to Ben Shalom's Boxxer, but has now decided to move to Frank Warren's promotional outfit.

"After speaking with multiple promoters, Queensberry has a plan I'm comfortable with," said Buatsi. 

"I'm a British fighter, and the support I get from UK fans means everything.

"There's nothing like fighting in front of a home crowd - the energy, the passion, it drives me. With Queensberry, I've got a team that understands that and backs me properly here in the UK."

Boxxer are reportedly set to part ways with broadcast giant Sky Sports and it is unclear on which platform the promotional outfit will land on.

Despite his loss to Smith, Buatsi is still considered one of the best light-heavyweights in Great Britain with 19 wins on his record. 

The Londoner won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics and Warren says Buatsi is still right in the mix for a world title shot.

Warren also promotes Anthony Yarde, who Buatsi has been linked with fighting since making his professional debut in 2017.

Yarde is set to contest David Benavidez for the WBC world title on 22 November in Saudi Arabia.

"Josh will be a natural candidate to take on the winner," Warren said.

Signing with Queensberry means Buatsi has partnered with every one of the major promotional companies in the UK, having began his pro career with Matchroom.

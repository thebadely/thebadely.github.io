Let's dive into the details: A British man has died in an avalanche in the French Alps.

The man, believed to be in his 50s, was skiing with a group off-piste at La Plagne, a statement from the resort said. 

Rescuers were alerted to the avalanche at 13:57 (12:57 GMT) on Sunday and went immediately to the area, it added.

The man was discovered under 2.5 metres (8ft) of snow after a 50-minute search. 

He had been skiing without an avalanche transceiver or a professional instructor, the resort said.

La Plagne said its thoughts were with the man's family.

BBC News has asked the Foreign Office for comment. 

The rescue team was made up of more than 50 people including medics, ski instructors and a helicopter-deployed dog.

La Plagne's official website prompts visitors wanting to ski off-piste, also known as backcountry skiing, to make sure they have read the Avalanche Risk Bulletin and to use an avalanche victim detector. 

December through to February is peak season for avalanches in the northern hemisphere. 

Only last month, five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, died in an avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains.

It has been recently reported that Girl guides can now earn badges for activities such as "fandoms", being a "booktivist" and sharing their "guiding sparkle".

For only the second time in Girlguiding's long history, new badges have been added to the list of patches that can be awarded.

The 72 new badges were launched in response to girls' requests to broaden the youth organisation's scope to include activities such as environmental conservation and building confidence.

Girlguiding acting CEO Amanda Azeez called the launch a "huge moment", emphasising the importance of the 116-year-old organisation "staying relevant to girls' wants and needs".

Different badges are available for the different age-related groups within Girlguiding.

Among the new badges the youngest, the Rainbows (aged four to seven), can earn are ones for laughter, grooving, courage and being a "bee rescuer".

One young girl told BBC Newsround that, as part of earning the laughter badge, another girl had made animal noises that the rest of the group then had to copy.

Brownies (aged seven to 10) will now be recognised for showing a keen interest in folklore or birdwatching, as well as discovering ways to make their voice heard.

Guides (aged 10-14) will be able to earn the "thrift" badge when they demonstrate the ability to "create something new" through repurposing and upcycling old items.

Badges can also be rewarded for strong interests. Rangers (aged 14 to 18) can earn a "fandoms" badge for sharing their enthusiasm for things like Taylor Swift or Harry Potter.

They can also become a "booktivist" by learn how reading can empower them.

Other badges across the new set are for activities such as codebreaking, engineering, friendship, history and interior design.

More than 20,000 girls and volunteers helped design the new badges and 11,000 girls tested out the activities that need to be completed to earn them.

Girlguiding ambassador and TV presenter Angellica Bell said trying the new badges had been "a real blast".

She said the organisation helped build girls' confidence "whilst tackling important issues impacting their lives such as online harm, sexism and misogyny".

"I know firsthand just how important it is for girls to have activities outside of school to educate but also have fun," she added.

The last time Girlguiding introduced new badges was in 2019 - 110 years after its founding.

Originally called the Girl Guide Association, the organisation was founded in 1909 by Agnes Baden-Powell to give girls the opportunity to take part in outdoor activities like the Scouts had for boys (which was incidentally set up by her brother).

Famous members include the late Queen Elizabeth II, who became a Guide in 1937 at the age of 11.

Fatima, a member of Girlguiding's youth steering group, said the new badges showed how the programme was "always evolving with us".

The 18-year-old added: "It's empowering to know our voices help shape what guiding looks like for the future."

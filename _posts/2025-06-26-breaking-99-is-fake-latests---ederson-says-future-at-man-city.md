Let's dive into the details: Goalkeeper Ederson has won six Premier League titles in eight years at Manchester City

Goalkeeper Ederson says his future is at Manchester City and says reports linking him with a move away are "99% fake news".

The 31-year-old signed from Benfica for Â£35m in 2017 and is entering the final year of his deal at Etihad Stadium.

The Brazil international had been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia last summer and said in October there was an "offer on the table" which was "way above the average".

The City number one is currently with the squad at the Club World Cup in the United States.

"My future is here," said Ederson. "Some friends send me a lot of news but 99% is fake news. I understand you guys.

"You need the news to put a like on social media, or rant for the news. I understand but there's a lot of fake news around my name."

Ederson is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world and has been integral to City's success in recent years - winning six Premier League titles, the Champions League and two FA Cups.

"My head is here," said Ederson. "It stays with the city. It gives me everything to go back to the Premier League again and try to win the Champions League as well.

"My mind is staying in the club."

Meanwhile, Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa has been linked with a move to City and reports say, external the Portugal goalkeeper has a Â£64m release clause in his contract.

Asked about Ederson's future, boss Pep Guardiola said: "I don't know.

"I am so pleased what I am seeing in the training sessions and he is with us. He has had a spectacular decade with us and his contribution has been massive in many aspects."

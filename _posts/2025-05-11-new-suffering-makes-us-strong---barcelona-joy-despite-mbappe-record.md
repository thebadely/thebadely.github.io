It has been recently reported that Barcelona are set to win a domestic double

After a heartbreaking defeat by Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals, there was a very real possibility of Barcelona's season falling apart.

In recent seasons, perhaps it would. Downgrading a potential treble to a solitary cup triumph would have been on brand not so long ago, given the club's struggles on and off the pitch in recent years.

But this is a new Barcelona.

After falling 2-0 behind in Sunday's Clasico against arch-rivals Real Madrid - the third time in four matches they have done that - Barcelona roared back to lead 4-2 at half-time, 4-3 by the end.

After surviving some late Madrid pressure, Barcelona know victory against Espanyol on Thursday will secure a 28th league crown. Defeat for Madrid against Mallorca on Wednesday would do the job for them.

Four Clasico victories in the same season - only the second time that has ever happened - highlights the marvelous job Hansi Flick has done since replacing Xavi as manager last summer.

A team who not too long ago lacked identity and belief now have both in abundance, even if they don't do things the easy way.

With young players including Lamine Yamal, Pedri and Pau Cubarsi enjoying stellar campaigns, the Blaugrana look well equipped to fight on all fronts for years to come.

After a quite opening period on Sunday, Flick's attack picked Madrid apart with their relentless pressing and ruthless finishing.

Defence remains a concern, and despite his loyalty to a high-line system, Flick pledged to work on it.

"I think this journey that we started last year, it's not over - I know that we have to improve a lot in defence," he said.

"It has nothing to do with the back four. When we make mistakes, Real have fantastic offensive players."

Speaking to Movistar Plus, Yamal said: "It was obviously very important to win today. It's great to have this game after the Champions League, I think it's already forgotten.

"Suffering is what makes you strong and what teaches you to correct the mistakes you make.

"It's been a difficult year; we haven't been able to be in our stadium... In the end, I told my mother, the Champions League is every year. We'll keep trying.

"It was very important to win today to get closer to the league title. We are delighted."

Victory means Barcelona have a seven-point advantage over second-placed Real Madrid with three games remaining. They are almost there.

Barcelona beat Real Madrid in thriller to move closer to title

Carlo Ancelotti has never sucessfully defended a league title during his managerial career

If the future at Barcelona looks bright, then the same cannot be said of Real Madrid.

Carlo Ancelotti's time at the club looks to be ending, and it is happening in the worst possible way.

Though Los Blancos played their part in a pulsating game, a fourth consecutive loss to their bitter rivals effectively handed them the league title.

Kylian Mbappe gave Madrid a 2-0 lead inside 15 minutes - becoming the club's highest-ever scorer in a debut campaign - before completing his hat-trick in the second half.

Yet the defensive struggles that derailed their season were clear for all to see as Barca led 4-2 by half-time.

Conceding 16 goals in four Clasicos this season is simply not acceptable.

Madrid pushed in the second half as Mbappe completed his hat-trick, but at the other end of the pitch Barcelona ran riot.

Things would have been different had 21-year-old substitute Victor Munoz not blazed over when through on goal, but then scoring goals has not been a major issue for Ancelotti's side this season.

That said, Ancelotti's main shortcoming this season has been the failure to find balance in a team with Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham at his disposal.

"It was an evenly played match, competitive and fought until the last second," Ancelotti told reporters.

"We could have scored the equaliser but it is what it is. It was a great game between two great teams, so I have nothing to reproach my team for in terms of attitude and commitment. It didn't go well but we competed.

"We have to defend better, that is quite evident from today's game, we defended badly and that's that."

Ancelotti is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, with former Madrid player Xabi Alonso expected to replace him once he leaves Bayer Leverkusen. The Spaniard could have his work cut out.

Asked pre-match about his future, Ancelotti said:  "With this club, the honeymoon doesn't end. The honeymoon with Madrid will last until the last day of my life."

A trophyless campaign hardly seems a fitting finale for a coach who has brought 15 major trophies to the club.

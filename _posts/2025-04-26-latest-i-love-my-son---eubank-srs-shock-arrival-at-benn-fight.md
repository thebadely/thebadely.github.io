Let's dive into the details: Chris Eubank Sr had not attended fight week and was expected to be absent on fight night

Chris Eubank Sr stood side by side with his son as the former world champion made a shock appearance on Saturday night at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

He arrived for Chris Eubank Jr's fight with Conor Benn to widespread surprise.

The father and son had supposedly been estranged for several years and Eubank had publicly objected to the fight due to the weight disparity.

Benn had taunted Eubank about his fractured relationship with his father in the build-up.

"Conor, that is not fair to say I don't like my son. I love my son. I may not like some of his ways - as I don't like some of your ways - but I love him," Eubank Sr told Sky Sports in the backstage area after his arrival.

Just days ago, Eubank Jr had spoken about his "pain" after Eubank Sr called the fight a "circus" and his son a "disgrace".

But in what will go down as an iconic and memorable moment in British boxing, the pair emerged from a car together when Eubank Jr arrived at the venue on Saturday.

Thousands of fans inside the stadium watched on the big screens and let out an almighty gasp as the Eubanks appeared from an elevator together.

"Whether I am ringside or in his corner, I am here," Eubank Sr said.

Cameras then panned to an equally shocked Benn in the dressing room.

Eddie Hearn smiled to the cameras as fans jeered Benn's promoter.

Eubank Sr beat Conor Benn's father, Nigel Benn, in 1990, before a contentious draw three years later.

While Nigel has been an ever-present throughout the build-up, Eubank Sr has criticised the fight because of a weight difference between the two fighters.

It has been recently reported that Former world number one Daniil Medvedev has won only one Grand Slam match in the 2025 season

A devastated Daniil Medvedev was knocked out of the US Open after a meltdown sparked by a photographer walking on to the court during his first-round defeat by  Benjamin Bonzi.

Medvedev has produced some extraordinary moments at Flushing Meadows over the years â but what happened on the 2021 champion's way to another humbling defeat was perhaps the most incredible.

As the Russian faced match point at 5-4 in the third set, the cameraman walked on to the playing surface between his French opponent Bonzi's first and second serve.

Cue bedlam as the incident - and Medvedev's reaction - changed the course of the match.

Medvedev, 29, raged after umpire Greg Allensworth decided Bonzi could have another first serve, whipping the New York crowd into a frenzy and forcing a delay of six minutes and 24 seconds.

Bonzi understandably lost focus as boos rained down and could not serve out victory. 

Almost two hours later, shortly before 1am local time, he eventually secured a remarkable 6-3 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 0-6 6-4 win.

"The energy was wild," said Bonzi. "Thanks for all those who were booing - thanks for the energy in the fifth set."

The photographer, who appeared to be trying to find a position in the long-lens pit at the side of the court, was later escorted out of Louis Armstrong Stadium by security.

"His credential has been revoked for the 2025 US Open," United States Tennis Association organisers told BBC Sport.

When an inspired Bonzi served for the match in the third set, Medvedev's recent struggles looked set to continue with a straightforward defeat.

Then the tone of the match - and the whole night - switched in an instant because of the mistake by the unsuspecting photographer.

Allensworth instantly shouted at the man to get off court and gave another first serve to Bonzi, because he deemed the interference to be an unreasonable delay.

Medvedev, who had been subdued to that point, became furious with Allensworth â whipping up the crowd with his hands as he skipped towards the umpire's chair to protest.

Medvedev accused the official - who was criticised by American player Reilly Opelka over a decision earlier this year - of "wanting to go home".

Medvedev was described as the US Open's "friendly villain" by former American player Sam Querrey in his role as an ESPN analyst

By now, the crowd was frenzied in its support of Medvedev and a chant of "second serve" rang around Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Medvedev continued to act as the ringleader before eventually attempting to quieten the boisterous crowd.

During the tense delay, Bonzi told Allensworth that Medvedev should be given a time violation because "he caused this".

When Bonzi eventually stepped on the baseline to serve, he was disrupted by more boos before finally resuming - and hearing cheers when he missed his first serve.

There were more roars seconds later when he lost the match point with a backhand into the net.

"It was a crazy scenario," Bonzi said.

"I have never experienced anything like that. It was so difficult to play, so noisy. But I tried to stay calm â it was not easy."

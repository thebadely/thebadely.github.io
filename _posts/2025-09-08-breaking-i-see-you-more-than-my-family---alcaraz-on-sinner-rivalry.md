Experts revealed that Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have won the past eight Grand Slams between them

There was an element of truth to the gag Carlos Alcaraz made as he clutched his latest Grand Slam trophy.

After beating Jannik Sinner to the US Open title, Alcaraz joked he is spending too much time with his Italian rival.

"I'm seeing you more than my family," grinned Alcaraz as he addressed Sinner during his on-court victory speech.

Alcaraz and Sinner have contested five different finals this season - including the trophy matches at the past three majors - as their grip on the ATP Tour shows no sign of slowing down.

Alarmingly for the rest watching on, they are continuing to push each other to greater heights.

The pair also cannot help bumping into each other off-court - Spaniard Alcaraz ran into his rival twice at Manhattan dining spots over the past fortnight in New York.

"I give 100% every day to improve, sitting down with the team to see what I can do better to beat Jannik and win these kind of trophies," Alcaraz said.

"Having this rivalry means a lot - it is super special for me, for him and for the people who enjoy every it single time we play."

When Sinner triumphed in the Wimbledon final two months ago, Alcaraz was made acutely aware of what he needed to do to ensure the same did not happen in New York.

Alcaraz and coach Juan Carlos Ferrero instantly identified what they needed to fix - but are keeping it a secret.

"For sure, Simone [Vagnozzi, Sinner's coach] will hear," said Ferrero shortly after his charge's victory.

Alcaraz was the outstanding player at Flushing Meadows, not dropping a set until the final, and was virtually impregnable on serve.

The way in which the 22-year-old regained the US Open title and number one ranking has been a product of the intense work he has done to develop his game.

At the start of the year, Alcaraz and Ferrero highlighted the importance of improving his serve.

The opening shot has continued to be a work in progress, ultimately breaking down in his Wimbledon loss, but it was key to his success over the past fortnight. 

The statistics underline it:

97% of service games won

84% of first serve points won

10 break points faced

3 breaks of serve conceded

Alcaraz's success in all facets of the game - not just the serve - was down to an improved mentality, as much as technique.

Often accused of lacking concentration and letting opponents back into matches, Alcaraz possessed a laser-focus throughout the tournament.

It allowed him to serve with pace and precision, as well as playing with variety in the rallies, using spin, slice and power to confound Sinner.

Alcaraz put the unwavering focus down to his growing maturity.

"I feel it is best tournament I've played from the first round to the end," he said.

Going into the US Open, Sinner had been marginally the more successful player over the past two seasons - even though he missed three months of this year because of a controversial doping case.

Alcaraz could not replace Sinner at the top of the rankings during that period, but the Italianâs 65-week reign as world number one is now at an end.

It has been a tumultuous season, but Sinner has still managed to reach all four Grand Slam finals and play at a level untouchable by nearly everyone else.

Sinner dropped only two sets in his path to the New York final, clinically brushing aside opponents with his metronomic baseline game.

But the one-dimensional victories may not have helped him against Alcaraz. Speaking after the final, Sinner said he played too rigidly when matches were "comfortable", making him "predictable" when he ultimately met his rival.

"I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive to a point where you play Carlos and have to go out of the comfort zone," Sinner said.

"I'm going to aim to, even if I lose some matches from now on, try to be a bit more unpredictable.

"I think that's what I have to do to become a better player."

Once again, Alcaraz and Sinner have swept the four majors. It leaves Alcaraz with six major titles to Sinner's four.

Their personal trilogy of Grand Slam finals was evenly balanced after the pair split the French Open and Wimbledon titles. 

But Alcaraz tipped the advantage in his favour with an assured four-set victory at Flushing Meadows.

The contest lacked the electricity of Roland Garros and the pomp of Wimbledon, but their duel was yet another illustration of how far ahead their level is of the rest of the field.

Remarkably, Novak Djokovic remains their biggest challenger - and he turned 38 in May.

Germany's Alexander Zverev seems to lack the belief he can win a major title, while American Taylor Fritz is yet to show he has the tools to beat them over five sets.

Britain's Jack Draper, 23, and Ben Shelton, another American aged 22, seem well placed with their explosive hitting - if they can stay fit and improve their consistency.

"I think if we have more players fighting for the big titles, it's going to be even more entertainment," said Ferrero.

"It's always welcome, the players that rise and play a high level.

"I think people will. They know where the level is and where they have to go."

Here’s what you need to know: Zhou raced in F1 for three seasons with the Alfa Romeo-branded Sauber team and was then Ferrari's reserve driver in 2025

Chinese Zhou Guanyu has joined the Cadillac team as reserve driver for their debut season in 2026.

The 26-year-old spent last year as reserve driver for Ferrari, after spending three seasons racing for the Alfa Romeo-branded Sauber team from 2022-24.

Zhou will act as support for race drivers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez, both of whom are returning to the grid in 2026 after spending last year out of the sport.  Bottas was Zhou's team-mate at Alfa Romeo.

Cadillac also have on their driver roster former Indycar driver Colton Herta, who is racing in Formula 2 this year in an attempt to earn enough licence points to qualify for an F1 super licence with a view to racing for Cadillac in the future.

Zhou, who is managed by Cadillac team principal Graeme Lowdon, said: "This is one of the biggest and most exciting new projects that the sport has ever seen.â¨

"I have worked with both Graeme and Valtteri for many years in various capacities, so joining the team feels like rejoining family."

Lowdon said: "We wanted a candidate who had recent F1 driving experience, is prepared to work hard as part of a team and understands the challenges of developing a car throughout the season. Zhou fits the bill perfectly. He will be a great asset to us as we go racing in 2026."

Cadillac will use Ferrari engines until their own F1 engine, designed at their in-house base at Charlotte in North Carolina, is ready. The company, which is part of US car giant General Motors, has committed to this being in 2029.

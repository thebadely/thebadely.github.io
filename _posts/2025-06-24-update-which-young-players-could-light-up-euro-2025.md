It has been recently reported that Lena Oberdorf was named young player of the tournament at Euro 2022, although she misses the competition in Switzerland because of injury

In July 2022, as Sarina Wiegman's Lionesses were celebrating being crowned champions of Europe, Germany's Lena Oberdorf was named the inaugural young player of the tournament.

Three years on and a new crop of players, from 16 countries, will arrive in Switzerland hoping to shine at this summer's Women's Euros.

BBC Sport has selected seven players under the age of 23 to look out for.

Age: 21 Position: Forward Club: Chelsea

England head coach Sarina Wiegman says Beever-Jones "scores goals very easily"

Before England's penultimate Women's Nations League group game, all of the attention was on Mary Earps' retirement. After the match, a different name dominated the headlines: Aggie Beever-Jones.

The forward seized her opportunity in the absence of injured duo Alessia Russo and Ella Toone, scoring a 33-minute hat-trick against Portugal. 

Tipping her to make an impact at Euro 2025, former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley praised her versatility, movement and goalscoring prowess. 

"She can play on the right, left, and in central areas. She's constantly on the move, hunting for the right opportunity to pounce on defenders," she told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"She is rarely offside. She is a true goalscorer, putting herself about, making a nuisance of herself."

Beever-Jones, who joined Chelsea's academy aged nine, was the Blues' top goal-scorer in the WSL last season with nine and also claimed the winner in their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool to keep them on track for a domestic treble.

Age: 21 Position: Midfielder Club: IFK Norrkoping

Carrie Jones moved to Sweden following Bristol City's WSL relegation in 2024

Wales will make history this summer by competing in their first major women's tournament and Carrie Jones, despite her tender years, is already well established in the squad.

Jones has been an international footballer for six years having made her Wales debut at 15 - before she was eligible to play for club side Cardiff City - and spent four seasons in the WSL with Manchester United, Leicester City and Bristol City followed by a move to Swedish side IFK Norrkoping in 2024. 

A versatile forward player, she is commonly deployed on the left flank for Wales but can also play in central midfield or a lone striker. 

In 2019, former Wales international Gwennan Harries tipped Jones to be "one of Wales' best players, external over the next 10-20 years".

"She's such a talent. So composed, got two great feet, but most importantly for me, her work ethic is outstanding, a real team player," she said. 

Age: 21 Position: Midfielder Club: Barcelona

Paralluelo is a former junior champion sprinter and hurdler

At 21, Salma Paralluelo already boasts a heavyweight CV.

A member of the 2023 World Cup-winning squad, she started five of Spain's seven matches, came off the bench to score in the quarter and semi-finals, and earned young player of the tournament honours. That triumph meant she became the first player to hold world titles at Under-17, Under-20 and senior level.

She has also won the 2024 Nations League, while domestically she is a two-time Champions League winner with Barcelona. 

In 2024, she was the youngest player in the top 20 of The Guardian's 100 best female footballers in the world, external and finished third in the Ballon d'Or standings for the last two seasons. 

Paralluelo, who had to choose between football and athletics, is a physical winger who drives hard at defenders and possesses a prolific left foot. 

She will be a key attacking threat for Spain, although she took a break after last summer's Olympics - because of mental and physical exhaustion and an issue with her left knee - and she has found playing time harder to come by on her return.

Age: 19 Position: Midfielder Club: Chelsea

Wieke Kaptein won the domestic treble with Chelsea during the 2024-25 season

At 19, Wieke Kaptein has already won multiple domestic trophies, first with FC Twente and now with Chelsea. 

During the 2024-25 campaign, the central midfielder forced her way into Sonia Bompastor's star-studded XI, starting seven of their 10 Champions League games, and was identified by BBC Sport as one of the unsung heroes of the Blues' invincible WSL season thanks to her contributions in the middle of the pitch.

Bompastor has been full of praise for Kaptein's work rate, stating: "She brings a lot of quality out of possession. She is really confident but also works hard off the ball. She works so hard for the team." 

Team-mate Kadeisha Buchanan added: "She's a unique player. She's cool, laid back. She shows that on the field - she's very composed. She's a fun, young talent."

Internationally, she has amassed 20 caps since making her debut in April 2023, typically playing on the right of a midfield three, and made history as the youngest player to represent the Netherlands at a Women's World Cup later that year.

Age: 20 Position: Defender Club: Bayern Munich

Franziska Kett was named in the team of the tournament at the 2023 Under-19 European Championships

The second-youngest player in the Germany squad and set to play in her first major tournament, Franziska Kett has long been on the radar of national team head coach Christian Wuck, who described her as a dynamic defender. 

The left-back made her debut for Bayern Munich in 2022 - one month before her 18th birthday - and has gone on to feature for the German champions in both the Frauen-Bundesliga and Women's Champions League. 

A member of the Under-19s squad which finished as runners-up at the European Championships in 2023, she was handed her senior debut in April 2025. 

"We have been keeping tabs on Franziska Kett and her development for some time now," Wuck said. "She provides a great deal of dynamism with her explosive style of play. We believe that she can do a job for the national team."

Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Barcelona

Schertenleib previously played for FC Zurich and Grasshopper Zurich before joining Barcelona

In a Barcelona squad brimming with top talent, you could be forgiven for not knowing Sydney Schertenleib's name. 

However, since moving to Spain from Grasshopper Zurich last summer, the 18-year-old has quickly established herself as a first-team regular, starting all but two of Barcelona's league matches since the beginning of March and coming off the bench in both legs of their Champions League quarter-final against Wolfsburg.

Although she typically plays on the left side of a midfield or forward three for Barcelona, Switzerland boss Pia Sundhage has preferred to use her as a right-sided striker, yielding two goals in her first 10 appearances.

In her first senior tournament, and playing on home soil, the setting is perfect for Schertenleib to make an impact.

Age: 21 Position: Defender Club: Lyon

Alice Sombath came through the youth ranks with Paris FC and Paris St-Germain before signing her first professional contract with Lyon aged 16

Sombath is one of a number of promising young French defenders looking to capitalise on the omission of the previously immovable Wendie Renard from the squad for the Euros.

Born in France to Thai parents, she joined Lyon aged 16 from rivals Paris St-Germain and 12 months later she made her senior debut alongside club legend Renard at centre-back in their opening game of the season.

Former Lyon manager Joe Montemurro said: "I think she's going to become a special player. She has all the qualities to become a top defender. 

"At a big club like Lyon, there are more experienced players, so she needs a little patience. But in the future, I think she'll be a great player for the French national team."

Comfortable at right-back or in central defence, Sombath made her France debut in November and was then paired alongside new captain Griedge Mbock in France's 4-0 win over Switzerland in May. 

She also got the nod ahead of Renard at centre-back for Lyon's Champions League semi-final first leg win over Arsenal.

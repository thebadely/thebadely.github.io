According to new developments, The Premier League is back - and so is Troy Deeney's team of the week.

Here are his choices after the first round of fixtures. Do you agree? Send us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

David Raya (Arsenal): Eight shots saved against Manchester United. The one down to his left-hand side was sensational - if that goes in, it changes the course of the game. He is going to be the foundation for Arsenal.

Rico Lewis (Manchester City): I have actually picked both full-backs from Manchester City. I thought Lewis and Rayan Ait-Nouri were excellent. They offered a lot going forward and were defensively solid. Lewis offered that wonderful assist to Erling Haaland.

Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City): Ait-Nouri handled the game excellently against his old club. He was defensively solid and offered a load going forward. They have managed to find that left-back solution, which they have struggled with for a long time.

William Saliba (Arsenal): Saliba produced a solid performance against Manchester United. A 1-0 win despite United clearly being the better team - Saliba is the rock of that defence. He didn't put a foot wrong and showed his class again. Arsenal have to win something this season if they want to keep him.

Dan Ballard (Sunderland): I was there at the Championship semi-final when he scored the goal to get them into the final, and he set the place alight. I can only imagine how he is feeling after his first Premier League goal. The place will have erupted and he was excellent for that.

Ethan Ampadu (Leeds United): In holding midfield, Ampadu was excellent. He had a really nasty tackle, and it looked like he could have done damage to his ankle, but he was excellent. He showed the armband, headed everything, tackled everything, and was really aggressive in his passing forwards - he was the catalyst for Leeds to go on to win.

Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest): Next to Ampadu is Anderson. That through ball alone gets him in the team. He has become an outside horse for being in the England squad for the World Cup. We thought last year could have been a bit of a fluke with Forest, but he was the driving force against Brentford. That pass through to Chris Wood was perfectly weighted and a lot of players would have rushed and tried to kick the ball away, but he played the pass. 

Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Reijnders produced the best performance of the weekend. A lot of people wouldn't know much about him if they don't watch Serie A, but he was fantastic for AC Milan. He's naturally a number 10 and was asked by Pep to play a little bit deeper, and I thought he was excellent. His flick for Lewis showed his quality and his left-right touch when he beat two players showed he could not only deal with the physicality, but that he has that creativity. His finish was just lovely - to just pass it into the corner.

Mohammed Kudus (Tottenham): Up front, Kudus was excellent for Spurs on that right side. He just looks like he had a new lease of life. He has gone into a Spurs team that needs him to play well and he looks like he will grow exceptionally with this team.

Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): Semenyo scored two goals for Bournemouth, and he was the perfect example for a young player - or any player in general - when there's something negative or some adversity towards you. He told the referee what had gone on, but then he grew in stature and that was a true mark of the man. He scored two goals and unfortunately wasn't on the winning team, but he was a winner for how he handled it.

Richarlison (Tottenham): In the middle I could have gone for Wood (Nottingham Forest) but chose not to, and I could have gone for Haaland (Manchester City) but I chose not to. I chose to go with Richarlison at Tottenham. He has had a really tough start with injuries, but Thomas Frank decided to start with him over Dominic Solanke and Richarlison repaid him with two wonderful goals. Really good link-up play, great running in behind. It's a World Cup year and that could be the catalyst for him to really kick on.

Regis le Bris (Sunderland): Excellent, excellent performance. I think he has been really strong in the transfer window and he has got so many people on board. The gameplan against West Ham was fantastic, very pragmatic. A huge win.

Richarlison

Last season was a tough one for Richarlison at Spurs, missing long periods with injury. He has hit the ground running in 2025-26, though it was time spent off the ground that was most impressive about his opening day against Burnley - scoring a superb bicycle kick, one of two goals he netted on Saturday.

It was the Brazilian's first Premier League double since scoring two against former side Everton in February 2024, while he's the first Spurs player to score two on opening day since Harry Kane in 2019-20 - a season Kane ended with 18 Premier League goals. The same for Richarlison in 2025-26 would be very well received by Spurs supporters. Just eight more doubles to goâ¦

Tijjani Reijnders

It was an incredibly impressive debut for midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, who became the first player to score and assist on his Premier League debut while playing for Manchester City since Sergio Aguero in August 2011. Perhaps surprisingly, it's only the second time in 179 top-flight appearances in his career that he's achieved that feat.

Only Erling Haaland had both more shots and more touches in the opposition box against Wolves than Reijnders (3 shots, 5 touches in box), while only Nico Gonzalez made more successful final third passes than the Dutchman (20). A standout debut to build on - and no City player has ever scored and assisted in each of their first two appearances before.

Virgil van Dijk

Reigning champions Liverpool got their season off to a winning start against Bournemouth and - in a game they scored four goals - their standout player was captain Virgil van Dijk.

In what was his 235th Premier League appearance for the club, Van Dijk posted his best totals for both clearances (17) and headed clearances (14), and his joint-best for aerial duels won (12). He was the first player to post all those totals in a single Premier League match since Jan Vertonghen in December 2016, and the only Liverpool player Opta has on record to do so. 

He may have turned 34 over the summer, but Van Dijk is still a colossus for the Reds.

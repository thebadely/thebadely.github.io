It has been recently reported that Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool are in fine form, having won the Wimbledon warm-up tournaments at Queen's and Eastbourne

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool became the first all-British pairing to reach the men's doubles final at Wimbledon in the Open era with victory over fourth seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos.

They served a remarkable 11 aces to their opponents' none to win 6-3 6-4 on a hot day on Court One.

Cash, 28, and 31-year-old Glasspool are the first all-British pair to reach the final since Mike Davies and Bobby Wilson in 1960.

It comes after they made history last month as the first all-British partnership to win the men's doubles title at Queen's in the Open era - which started in 1968 when professionals were allowed to take part in Grand Slam tournaments.

They followed that up with victory at Eastbourne and had already knocked out  defending Wimbledon champions Henry Patten and Harri Heliovaara.

They will meet David Pel of the Netherlands and Australia's Rinky Hijikata in the final on Saturday.

Fifth seeds Cash and Glasspool, who are chasing their first Grand Slam trophy as a pairing, were efficient across the two sets and converted their two break points to seal victory.

Britons have enjoyed success in the men's doubles in recent years with Patten winning the title alongside Finnish partner Heliovaara last year and Neal Skupski doing so with Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof the year before.

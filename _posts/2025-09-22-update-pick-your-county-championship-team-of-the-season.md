Let's dive into the details: Dom Sibley was the first batter to reach 1,000 Championship runs this summer and hit 305 against Durham in June

The evenings are drawing in, the big coats are out of the attic, and supermarkets are packed with Halloween paraphernalia.

It must mean we are in the dying embers of another County Championship cricket season, but who have been your standout performers in 2025?

With Nottinghamshire in pole position to win the title going into the final round of games, will you select their opening pair of Haseeb Hameed and Ben Slater?

Could James Coles or Rehan Ahmed make the team as your all-rounder? Will Kyle Abbott or Jamie Porter find favour as a pace option?

Pick your XI from the players listed below and we will collate all the votes before publishing an overall team of 2025 later in the week.

Just to get you started, here are the sides selected for the past two seasons:

2024: Rory Burns (Surrey), Alex Davies (Warwickshire), Colin Ingram (Glamorgan), David Bedingham (Durham), Jordan Cox (Essex), James Bracey (Gloucestershire), Liam Dawson (Hampshire), Jack Carson (Sussex), Dan Worrall (Surrey), Jamie Porter (Essex), Ben Coad (Yorkshire).

2023: Alex Lees (Durham), Jake Libby (Worcestershire), Josh Bohannon (Lancashire), Tom Westley (Essex), James Rew (Somerset), Leus du Plooy (Derbyshire), Liam Dawson (Hampshire), Simon Harmer (Essex), Jordan Clark (Surrey), Brett Hutton (Nottinghamshire), Jamie Porter (Essex).

Teams must include two openers, three middle-order batters, one wicketkeeper, one all-rounder, one spinner and three seam bowlers.

Players needed to have featured in at least six games this season to make our shortlist, and all statistics are correct up to and including Saturday, 20 September.

Voting will close at 12:00 BST on Friday, 26 September.

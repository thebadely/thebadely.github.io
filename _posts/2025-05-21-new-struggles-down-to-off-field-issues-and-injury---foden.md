According to new developments, Phil Foden has scored only seven times in the Premier League this season

Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden says he has "struggled" this season because of off-field issues and an ankle injury suffered against Manchester United.

The 24-year-old enjoyed his best Premier League campaign last term by scoring 19 goals and helping City to an unprecedented fourth top-flight title in a row.

He also collected the Player of the Season and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards, as well as being named in the PFA Team of the Year.

Foden started all seven games as he helped England reach the final of the European Championship last July, where they were edged out by Spain.

But he has managed only 10 goals in all competitions this term and has failed to score in his past 19 games for club and country - a run stretching back to January.

Foden says he suffered "bad" ligament damage to his ankle when tackled by United midfielder Casemiro during the goalless derby draw on 6 April - he missed the next two games but returned to training "quite early".

Asked to assess his own season, Foden said: "It's been difficult. It took a while to heal before I can push myself back in training, I had to look after it. It's been a frustrating season for me.

"I know if everything was OK, I'd definitely be better on the field. Sometimes things happen and you have to deal with it and move on. Unfortunately I've had a difficult season.

"Now it's just about improving and getting back to my best. I know my standards and what I can reach. I'm looking forward to getting back."

During the game at Old Trafford, Foden was subjected to derogatory chants about his mother, with City manager Pep Guardiola saying United fans showed "a lack of class".

In January, Foden told the Manchester Evening News, external he had felt physically and mentally burned out.

Foden added: "I've had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. It's one of them - sometimes there's things in life that are bigger than football. This season I've struggled a little bit.

"Hopefully come next year I can get my head mentally right, get back where I left the season before - because I know what I'm capable of doing and the quality I have."

City have had a poor campaign, relinquishing hold of the Premier League trophy, exiting the Champions League in the last 16 and being stunned by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final.

They end the season with a trip to Fulham on Sunday (kick-off 16:00 BST), knowing a point should clinch a Champions League place for next season.

But City have a quick turnaround this summer as they will be competing in the expanded Club World Cup, which starts in the US on 14 June.

"It's obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season," said Foden. "I believe everyone needs the right time to recover to go back to next season.

"Obviously there will be this competition that's coming up. It's going to be a funny one, some clubs will take it more seriously than others but I know City and the club we are, we'll definitely take it seriously."

Before that, manager Thomas Tuchel names his England squad on Friday for the World Cup qualifier in Andorra on 7 June and friendly against Senegal at the City Ground three days later.

Asked if he needs to rest his ankle, Foden said: "Obviously it's a difficult situation for me with the internationals right around the corner.

"It's something we have to speak with the club and national team to see maybe if it's better to rest and get my ankle fully 100% back how I want it.

"I just don't know at the moment. It's a conversation to be had and we'll see what happens."

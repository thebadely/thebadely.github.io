Experts revealed that Jamie Roberts played 94 internationals for Wales

Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) board member Jamie Roberts says he is hoping the right decisions will be made about the future of the game.

A controversial proposal to reduce the number of professional men's sides in Wales from four to two was the WRU's preferred option among four models presented in August.

There was opposition from players, supporters and clubs to this proposal.

After a public consultation took place, WRU director of rugby Dave Reddin last week presented his findings to the WRU board with a final decision expected on Welsh rugby's future to be announced by the end of October. 

Former Wales centre Roberts is one of three former internationals on the 12-strong WRU board alongside Amanda Bennett and Claire Donovan.

"There are important decisions to be made," Roberts told S4C.

"It's a privilege for me to be involved at this moment in a very special moment for Welsh rugby. 

"Hopefully the right decisions will be made for the benefit of Welsh rugby as a whole."

Who will decide the fate of Welsh rugby?

The three other options tabled by the WRU include two proposals suggesting a reduction in one side by keeping three teams. These choices are now seriously being considered by the WRU board. 

Cardiff are owned by the WRU after the side temporarily went into administration in April.

With WRU chief executive Abi Tierney having already said she cannot see a situation where professional rugby would not be played in the Welsh capital, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets will be nervously watching what happens. 

Reddin says he hopes a consensus could be reached if regions needed to be cut, with mergers an option.

Ospreys chief executive Lance Bradley says he can not imagine any possible merger with west Wales rivals Scarlets - that prospect having previously come close in 2019. 

"I credit myself as a rather imaginative person but even I can't imagine that," Bradley told BBC Radio Wales Sport.

"I can't see how it could work. It was proposed a few years ago but there would be so many barriers to it now, that I find it very hard to imagine."

Bradley says he hopes to have some clarity by the end of October.

"We have been working closely with the WRU but at the end of the day it will be them who has to make the decision," said Bradley.

"We have had a lot of conversations and they have been constructive. 

"We felt that in a meeting we had with Dave Reddin that he genuinely listened to what we said and we hope that will be taken on board."

Ospreys are waiting on the decision to see if they can move into their new St Helen's home next season, with a proposed Â£5m redevelopment project being funded by Swansea Council.

"Some of the work has started at St Helen's but it has always been the case Swansea Council, who are helping us fund the project, have said they will release the funding once they know what the future is and that is still the case," said Bradley.

"Once we get some certainty, we can press ahead with it."

This delay means Ospreys will play home matches for one season at the Brewery Field in Bridgend and they started with a 24-0 win against Zebre on Saturday.

"It is a super ground and the atmosphere is fantastic," said Bradley.

"We have been able to work with Bridgend Ravens and do some work on the ground before the season started.

"Because we have known we were coming here for a while, we have put some additional work into the pitch, so we are confident it will stand up to the rigours of the season."

Ospreys are also waiting to see whether star forwards Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake will stay, with the pair out of contract at the end of the 2025-26 season.

"You always want to hang onto your best players and when they are coming up to the end of their contracts, it is always a time when they can be approached by other teams," said Bradley.

"We hope to be able to keep our best players as we always do."

All Welsh players face an uncertain future but Ospreys head coach Mark Jones says his squad are handling things "exceptionally well".

"The boys are doing a great job. I think you've only got to look at the way they play, the attitude towards the way they're playing," said Jones.

"That tells you what sort of mindset they're in and I can't give them enough compliments around that side of things.

"They're not burying their heads in sand and pretending it's not there and they're acknowledging what's there when they need to,"

Here’s what you need to know: Striker Adam Idah leaves Celtic just a year after signing a five-year deal with the Glasgow giants

Swansea City have signed Celtic striker Adam Idah for an undisclosed fee which is believed to be an initial Â£6m.

Idah, 24, becomes the most expensive signing ever made by Swansea when not in the Premier League, with the transfer fee potentially rising to Â£7m.

The 32-cap Republic of Ireland international has agreed a five-year contract with the Championship club.

"Adam's all-round ability and his experience at the highest level make him a quality addition to our squad, and his signing is an indication of our ambitions for the club moving forward," said Swansea head coach Alan Sheehan.

"He is an ambitious young player who wants to play a big role in what we are trying to build at Swansea, and his movement and ability to stretch defences will be a real asset to us."

Swansea have spent the summer searching for a new centre-forward and have seen a number of targets move elsewhere.

But Sheehan has eventually got his man after a fee for Idah was agreed with Celtic last week.

The Scottish giants delayed the deal over the weekend before finalising Idah's departure.

The Cork-born player leaves Celtic having scored 29 goals in 76 appearances across two spells in Glasgow, first while on loan in 2023-24 and then after joining for a reported fee of Â£9.5m last summer.

Idah moved to Scotland from Norwich City, where he scored 17 goals in 116 appearances â 39 of which were starts â after coming through the club's academy.

"We have wanted to add to Alan's forward options during this window and a lot of hard work has gone in to trying to find a player who was the right person and the right fit for that role," said Swansea director of football Richard Montague.

"Adam has a wealth of senior experience, including at the highest level of European club competition, and we expect him to make a considerable impact for Swansea City."

Idah will become a team-mate of Zan Vipotnik at Swansea after the club ruled out selling the Slovenia international.

Vipotnik had been tipped to move on if Idah arrived, but is to remain in Wales having produced the best form of his Swansea career in the early part of the season.

Swansea are also hoping to sign Strasbourg left-back Ishe Samuels-Smith and a winger - with Burnley's Manuel Benson among their targets - with the possibility that further deals will be confirmed on Tuesday. 

Swansea considered moves for Hull's Abu Kamara, who joined Getafe, and Sunderland's Patrick Roberts, who has signed for Birmingham City.

Three players have left Swansea on loan, with Ollie Cooper joining Wigan, Filip Lissah moving to Falkirk and Joel Cotterill switching to Bristol Rovers.

According to new developments, The Times reports that cabinet ministers are demanding the sacking of the No 10 chief of staff Morgan McSweeney because of what the paper calls "vicious" Downing Street briefings against the health secretary.

The Daily Telegraph leads on Wes Streeting's response, when he called the briefings toxic and juvenile. 

Sir Keir Starmer's allies have warned that ousting him could trigger a general election, according to the Daily Mail.

The leader column in the Sun says Downing Street is in the grip of suicidal paranoia and the government has exploded into civil war.

The Daily Mirror leads on the release of emails related to Jeffrey Epstein in the US, and pictures Donald Trump with the late sex offender at Mar-a-Lago in 1997.

The Financial Times quotes one email apparently written by Epstein, in 2015, to a New York Times reporter, asking if they would like "photos of Donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen".  

"Epstein messages pile pressure on Trump" is the headline for the Guardian which highlights the president's claim that Democrats are trying to distract from their role in the federal government shutdown.

The BBC is preparing to apologise formally to president Trump over last year's misleading Panorama edit, according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper says lawyers at the corporation are working on the wording of the BBC's response.

Sources tell the i Paper the BBC believes it could win a court battle if Trump carries out his threat to sue for $1bn, but they are said to fear that an angry president could destroy its US ambitions.

Many of the papers pick up on an analysis of Adolf Hitler's DNA that's to be the subject of a Channel 4 documentary.

The Times says a grisly memento taken from his Berlin bunker - a blood-stained piece of sofa fabric - has revealed he had Kallman syndrome, a genetic disorder that hinders the typical progression of puberty, and sexual development.

As the Daily Telegraph puts it, scientists believe the wartime song about Hitler and his henchmen was correct: he did only have one ball, and possibly a micro-penis.

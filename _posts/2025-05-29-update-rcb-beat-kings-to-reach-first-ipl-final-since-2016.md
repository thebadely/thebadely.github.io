Experts revealed that India legend Virat Kohli has been with Royal Challengers Bengaluru since the first Indian Premier League in 2008, but has never won the competition

Indian Premier League, New Chandigarh

Punjab Kings 101 (14.1 overs): S Sharma 3-17, Hazlewood 3-21

Royal Challengers Bengaluru 106-2 (10 overs): Salt 56 (27)

Royal Challengers Bengaluru won by eight wickets

Scorecard

Royal Challengers Bengaluru are one match from a first Indian Premier League title after sealing a place in the final with an eight-wicket thrashing of Punjab Kings.

Kings batted dismally and were bowled out for 101 in 14.1 overs, with RCB chasing down their low target with half the innings to spare.

Spinner Suyash Sharma and seamer Josh Hazlewood took three wickets apiece, while opener Phil Salt struck an unbeaten 56 from 27 deliveries as RCB recorded the biggest win by balls remaining in the history of the IPL play-offs. 

RCB will now progress directly to Tuesday's final, their first since 2016, while Kings will play the winners of Friday's match between Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians, with the victors taking the other place in the title decider.

Kings finished top of the regular season table, ahead of RCB on net run-rate, and went into bat after losing the toss in New Chandigarh.

They immediately found themselves in trouble, slipping to 38-4 inside the powerplay.

Marcus Stoinis top-scored with 26 from number six as Kings continued to steadily lose wickets, with opener Prabhsimran Singh and tail-ender Azmatullah (both 18) the only other batters to make it out of single figures.

Kings had defended 111 at this ground in April, but a repeat performance seemed like a tall order.

Kyle Jamieson had Virat Kohli caught behind for 12 in the fourth over, but from there England international Salt anchored a simple chase.

He struck six fours and three sixes in his innings, reaching 50 from 23 balls for his fastest half-century in the IPL.

However, it was Rajat Patidar who closed out the match in style, clearing the ropes from the final delivery of Musheer Khan's 10th over to wrap up a gigantic victory.

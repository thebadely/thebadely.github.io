Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Conor Bradley and Isaac Price are two key players of Northern Ireland's new generation under Michael O'Neill

"I think back of when we were successful in 2016 and we were really, really hard to beat. 

"We knew what we were good at and I see similarities in this team. There are a lot more legs and more youthfulness now, but there's a similarity in being really hard to beat."

As a former Northern Ireland Euro 2016 favourite and Premier League player with Leeds United, Stuart Dallas knows what it takes to be successful.

Now retired, he's watching Michael O'Neill's "new era" Northern Ireland gear up for World Cup qualifying, and he likes what he is seeing. 

After a 2-1 defeat in Copenhagen to Denmark, O'Neill's young side had to dig deep to beat Iceland at Windsor Park. 

After Isaac Price's latest moment of brilliance lit up a drab first-half, the game turned when Brodie Spencer was sent off in the 57th minute and Iceland piled on the pressure.

It was a new challenge for his young team and, as Dallas adds, "they had to show a different side to them".

It was a test they passed with flying colours. 

"This team have a strong character and desire when things are going against them to stay in the game," said O'Neill.

"There's a lot of things we can do better, but we can't ask any more in terms of character and defending as a team and a unit."

O'Neill pleased with Northern Ireland 'character'

The fact this Northern Ireland squad are young is not a new realisation, but it was highlighted by the fact the average of the 10 players on the pitch heading into injury time was just 22. 

Teenage goalkeeper Pierce Charles put in his strongest performance in a Northern Ireland shirt to date, and he pulled off a big save in the dying embers while Ruairi McConville, 20, hooked the ball off the line and reacted quickly to hack any further danger away.

Needing to see out the game, O'Neill turned to Terry Devlin and Brad Lyons, who had a combined total of six caps. 

They helped the cause, and the team got over the line. 

In fact, it was only the third time Northern Ireland had ever won a match having a player sent off - and the first since the famous win over Spain in the 1982 World Cup.

"Nights like this help us develop as a team," O'Neill added on dealing with adversity.

"When we look back at the two games we will find a lot of positives, but we are always looking at it to get better.

"This is still pretty early in the progression of this team."

After defeats in Sweden and Denmark, the win over Iceland was a timely boost with World Cup qualifying looming in September.

Northern Ireland start their bid in Luxembourg and Germany, and also face Slovakia in their bid to make a first finals in 40 years.

However, no matter what happens in the remainder of 2025, O'Neill knows it won't define the team and the growth will continue. 

"The reality is I know the team will continue to progress beyond the World Cup campaign," he added.

"It's just natural. The more they play international football the better they will get at it.

"That's what they need, they need more exposure and more minutes under their belts. Will the World Cup campaign come too soon for this group? 

"I don't know,  the proof will be in the games but we approach it in a good place and we're optimistic.

"There's a belief in there that we can go and take points at this level."

Tuesday's performance will only enhance that belief. 

While O'Neill says he does not like to compare teams, he acknowledges the resilience shown at Windsor Park is a useful, and somewhat familiar trait from his Euro 2016 side all those years ago.

However, those players were hardened internationals at a different point in their careers, and O'Neill wants his young players to forge their own path and their own story.

"I think the result shows that [resilience]. I don't compare the teams, I never do. This is a totally different group of boys at a totally different part of their careers. 

"They did show a lot of resilience, but the important thing is not to saddle them with that. 

"Let them grow as a team and hopefully in the World Cup campaign in September we can get a few results and give ourselves a chance."

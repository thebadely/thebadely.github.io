It has been recently reported that Arsenal beat Lyon 5-3 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the Women's Champions League last season

Holders Arsenal will host record eight-time winners Lyon in the league phase of the revamped Women's Champions League.

Arsenal beat Barcelona in last season's final to win the Champions League for a second time, having previously lifted the trophy in 2007.

The Gunners will also welcome Real Madrid and Twente, with trips to Bayern Munich, Benfica and Belgian club Leuven to come.

Debutants Manchester United - who came through two rounds of qualifying to reach the main draw - can also prepare for a home meeting with Lyon, with Paris St-Germain and Norwegian side Valerenga also set to visit.

Marc Skinner's side will travel to Wolfsburg, Juventus and Atletico Madrid.

Chelsea will have the chance for revenge when they reunite with Barcelona, having lost 8-2 on aggregate in last season's semi-finals.

Paris FC and Roma also head to Chelsea, with the Women's Super League champions travelling to Wolfsburg, St Polten and Twente.

There are 18 teams in this season's expanded league phase format - up from 16 across four groups in 2024-25 - with each club facing six teams.

The top four automatically qualify for the quarter-finals and the eight teams ranked between fifth and 12th enter the knockout phase play-off round.

Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo, Norway, will host the final with the date to be confirmed between 22-24 May 2026.

Matchday one is set to take place on 7-8 October, with the final round of games all kicking off at the same time on 17 December.

The order of the fixtures will be confirmed on Saturday.

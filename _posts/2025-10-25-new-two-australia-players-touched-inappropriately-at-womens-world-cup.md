Let's dive into the details: Two Australia cricketers were "approached and touched inappropriately" while in India for the Women's Cricket World Cup, Cricket Australia has said. 

The incident occurred in Indore on Thursday, the morning after Australia had beaten England, as the players were walking to a cafe.

Police in Indore confirmed a man has been arrested. 

"We can confirm two members of the Australian Women's Team were approached and touched inappropriately by a motorcyclist while walking to a cafe in Indore," Cricket Australia said in a statement.

"The matter was reported by team security to police who are handling the matter."

Rajesh Dandotiya, additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) in Indore, told BBC News Hindi: "The accused followed the women players for some distance and kept passing lewd remarks. 

"He then moved his motorcycle closer... making inappropriate physical contact. The accused was identified through CCTV footage and arrested."

Australia are playing South Africa in their final group-stage match of the tournament on Saturday in Indore.

Devajit Saikia, honorary secretary of the BCCI, said: "This is a deeply regrettable and isolated incident. India has always been known for its warmth, hospitality and care towards all guests. 

"We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards such acts. We appreciate the swift and effective action taken by the Madhya Pradesh Police in apprehending the accused. The law will take its due course to ensure justice is served. 

"We will also review our existing safety protocols and strengthen them further, if necessary, to ensure such incidents are not repeated."

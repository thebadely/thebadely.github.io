According to new developments, Alexander Isak scored his 22nd goal of the season as Newcastle overcame Ipswich Town 3-0

Newcastle boosted their Champions League qualification hopes with a comfortable win against Ipswich Town on Saturday, with goals from Alexander Isak, Dan Burn and Will Osula sending Eddie Howe's side third in the Premier League. 

The victory moved them above Manchester City, who had posted a late victory against fellow top-five contenders Aston Villa earlier in the week. 

Chelsea also earned an important 1-0 win against Everton on Saturday to climb to fifth, and are only two points behind Newcastle and tied with Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand. 

After the latest set of results in the English top flight, only five points separate Villa, in seventh, and third-placed Newcastle.

With the Premier League's top five guaranteed a spot in the Champions League next term, the race for Europe remains closely contested as the season enters its final weeks. 

Forest have twice lifted the European Cup but have not played in Europe's premier competition since 1980, while Villa reached the quarter-finals this season, where they lost to Paris St-Germain. 

As many as 11 European places are up for grabs and there will definitely be a minimum of eight Premier League teams - up from the usual seven - playing in Europe next season, but things could change in the coming weeks.

It means Crystal Palace, down in 12th, remain in contention for a place in Europe through the league as well as if they win the FA Cup. 

BBC Sport takes a look at how many teams could qualify for each of the European competitions - the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.

Brentford: Nottingham Forest (A); Manchester United (H); Ipswich (A); Fulham (H); Wolves (A)

Crystal Palace: Nottingham Forest (H); Tottenham (A); Wolves (H); Liverpool (A)

Depending on how things pan out this season there will be between eight and 11 teams from the Premier League taking part in Europe next season.

A minimum of five of those will be in the Champions League, which is higher than the usual four because of England's performance in Uefa's coefficient rankings.

That number could rise to six should Arsenal win the Champions League and finish outside the top five - an unlikely prospect - or even seven if that happens and Manchester United or Tottenham win the Europa League.

The maximum number of Premier League teams who could be competing in the Europa League is three. 

Two places will likely go to the team who finishes sixth and the FA Cup winners.

However, if the cup winners have already secured a European place it will then go to the next highest placed side that has not qualified for Europe.

A third place could be awarded if Chelsea win the Conference League and fail to qualify for the Champions League.

There will be one Conference League place awarded to a Premier League team.

Currently, that will go to Carabao Cup winners Newcastle, but that could change if Eddie Howe's side qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League. 

As Newcastle currently sit inside the top four that looks likely.

There is realistic scenario where finishing ninth or 10th in the Premier League could earn you a spot in the Conference League.

This could happen, but it is highly improbable.

It would require Arsenal to win the Champions League, Manchester United or Tottenham to win the Europa League and Chelsea to lift the Conference League trophy, and all three winners to finish outside the top six.

Arsenal are second in the Premier League and highly unlikely to finish outside the top five.

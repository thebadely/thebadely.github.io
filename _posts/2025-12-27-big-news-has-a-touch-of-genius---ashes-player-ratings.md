England win chaotic two-day Test to get on series scoreboard

England have won a Test match in Australia for the first time in almost 15 years, beating the hosts by four wickets in a remarkable two-day Test at the MCG.

Here are our player ratings for the Melbourne contest: 

Ben Duckett â 6 â Surely would have been glad to be back on the field after a difficult time off it. Another across-the-line dismissal in the first innings, but got England going in the second.

Zak Crawley â 6 â Another under-pressure England opener who did well to get them going in the second innings. Still needs a score in what are likely to be more traditional conditions in Sydney.

Jacob Bethell â 6 â  Justified his selection with an assured second-innings 40 that surely would have been beyond Ollie Pope. Will be interesting to see him get a chance on a flat pitch.

Joe Root â 3 â A duck in the first innings, but battled for 15 in the second innings to ensure Australia did not get on a roll. Has looked short of rhythm since that epic hundred in Brisbane.

Harry Brook â 7 â Swashbuckling 41 in the first innings was the most important knock of the match. Can be infuriating, but possesses a touch of genius.

Ben Stokes â 7 â Important runs in the first innings and stepped up with the ball when Gus Atkinson got injured. Deserves this for everything he has given to England.

Jamie Smith â 4 â An improved game with the gloves that could have been even better if he did not stand so deep. Has anyone in the England backroom mentioned it?

Will Jacks â 2 â Did not bowl, only batted once and dropped a catch, yet can say he was part of a rare England win in Australia.

Gus Atkinson â 6 â His best display of the series, which might now be cruelly ended by a hamstring problem. Much better with the ball and crucial runs late on day one.

Brydon Carse â 7 â Started slowly with the ball, then improved to put in his best display of the series on the second morning. Gets an extra mark for the audacity of batting at number three.

Josh Tongue â 7 â Sublime on the first day to pick up five wickets, including his bunny Steve Smith. Staking a claim to be in England's first-choice attack every time he is fit. Named player of the match.

Carse dismisses Neser and Starc as both fall for a duck

Jake Weatherald â 2 â Has not looked Test quality since making a maiden half-century in Brisbane. Should have been a weakness England exploited while the series was alive.

Travis Head â 6 â Started the week on the front of the Herald Sun, pictured with his family in front of a Christmas tree. Has a poor record at the MCG, yet made the highest score of the match.

Marnus Labuschagne â 2 â Struggled in the conditions. Another Australia batter going backwards and battling to justify his recall.

Steve Smith â 5 â Ran out of partners in the second innings, continued as Josh Tongue's bunny in the first. Gets a point for correctly predicting how difficult batting would be in this match.

Usman Khawaja â 4 â Batted for a relatively long time in the first innings, without scoring quickly, then a duck in the second. Will Sydney be the last Test of his career?

Alex Carey â 4 â Quiet match with the bat for one of Australia's players of the series. Still superb with the gloves.

Cameron Green â 4 â Twice got starts, twice found a way to get out, first with a run out then a poor shot. Slowly slipping down the order. Could soon end up as number 12.

Michael Neser â 7 â Australia's top performer in the first innings with both bat and ball, though could be vulnerable if Sydney is flat.

Mitchell Starc â 4 â Would have expected to feast in such helpful conditions, only to have a strangely quiet game. Drop of Ben Duckett proved to be vital.

Jhye Richardson â 3 â Used sporadically on his return to Test cricket â a four-year wait for two days of action.

Scott Boland â 6 â No heroics to match the Boxing Day Ashes Test of four years ago. Added mark for batting 11 and opening in the same day.

According to new developments, A pair of childhood friends who were reunited at a community support hub have praised the "vital charity" which runs it.

Alan Thompson, 71, first visited Green Synergy in Lincoln two years ago where he met Jane Innes, 70, and they have been "best friends" since.

"We'd gone our own ways and bumped back into each other," Thompson said.

The charity on Roman Pavement offers offers warm space sessions as well as advice and support.

"Two years ago I wouldn't have thought of coming to one of these places. Getting to know Jane again has been brilliant," Thompson added.

Innes, who has attended sessions for more than five years, said she enjoyed talking to people in her community.

"You meet people, neighbours who you've known since you were a kid," she said.

"You try and help people if you can."

Green Synergy was awarded £5,000 by National Grid to support its warm spaces project which also involves handing out items such as blankets and hot water bottles.

Community engagement co-ordinator Wendy Slater said her team was made up of "real people" which gained the support of people in the city.

"They know they can come here, they trust us," she said.

Slater said the charity offered various sessions and was "here for whatever people want".

She said: "I remember being in a situation myself when I felt no one was there to help.

"The rough times I've gone through are beneficial to others."

As well as offering a warm space, Green Synergy supports vulnerable residents living poverty, loneliness and isolation. It also runs community gardens to help improve mental health and wellbeing.

Slater said she felt a sense of pride when someone uses the support to better their life.

She said: "When you see someone walk past the door and they've gone from really struggling to have a job.

"I didn't do it for them, but I gave them that step on the ladder."

Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played

Sonia Bompastor says the Women's Super League title is "probably gone" for her Chelsea side after they were beaten 2-0 by Arsenal at Stamford Bridge.

Second-half goals from Beth Mead and Mariona Caldentey left the reigning champions six points behind leaders Manchester City, who have a game in hand.

On a run of 11 straight league wins, City will go nine points clear if they beat London City Lionesses on Sunday (11:55 GMT).

"We know the title race is probably gone, but our mentality is to fight until the very end," Bompastor said. "Now we have to focus on staying in second."

Chelsea face Manchester City at Etihad Stadium next weekend.

In seasons gone by, Chelsea have led the way, winning games relentlessly - but this time City are playing that role.

Chelsea are scoring far less regularly, with 24 league goals in 13 games so far compared with 38 by this stage last season. 

They have conceded eight goals - two more than at this stage a year ago. While that is still the current best defensive record in the WSL, they are keeping fewer clean sheets - six in 13 games this season compared with nine last year.

On-pitch performances back up the numbers.

When Chelsea kicked off their title defence with a 2-1 win over Manchester City on the opening night back in September, it suggested they would be the team to beat once again in 2025-26.

That evening Bompastor's side exhibited every ounce of their ruthless, winning nature. The problem is, it has not been consistently evident since.

In the autumn, nervy wins over Aston Villa, Leicester and Tottenham enabled them to keep pace at the top of the table but a run of three draws in four slowed momentum.

At that stage, nine games in, Manchester City's lead at the top was just three points but the true sickener for Chelsea was the 1-0 loss at home to struggling Everton.

That was Sonia Bompastor's first loss since succeeding Emma Hayes in the summer of 2024, and ended her side's 34-game unbeaten league run.

That handed City a six-point advantage, which they retained into the winter break.

Although Chelsea kicked off 2026 with a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham, City are yet to blink. Instead, Chelsea have been the team to falter again, this time losing to London rivals Arsenal on their own patch.

Former Blues midfielder Fara Williams summed it up best on BBC One: "Chelsea just didn't turn up."

With their title destiny out of their hands, Chelsea could now focus on the Champions League, the one major trophy they are yet to win.

England's record goalscorer Ellen White says she would understand the temptation to do that.

"Six points away, the title is a tough one," she said. "It's really hard to think about City slipping up. The Champions League is a huge one for them and they are into the quarter-finals. 

"They need to focus on themselves."

However, while Bompastor seems to be conceding the title, there might be more to it.

If so, Bompastor would not be the first Blues boss to play media mind games. 

Predecessor Emma Hayes did just that after a 4-3 loss at Liverpool in May 2024. That result meant that with three games to go, Chelsea had a six-point deficit to chase down.  

However, they still ended the 2023-24 season as champions, usurping Manchester City on goal difference on the final day.

With nine games left, it may well be too soon to call the title race done, regardless of what Bompastor says.

There is still plenty of time yet for Chelsea to surge into form and Manchester City to slip up.

In the meantime, all eyes are on the top two facing off next Sunday in east Manchester.

Experts revealed that Buonanotte joined Brighton from Rosario Central in 2023

Chelsea are nearing a season-long loan move for Brighton attacker Facundo Buonanotte. 

The 20-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Leicester, had been expected to go to Leeds on loan, but Chelsea have made a surprise move.

Buonanotte, who has earned two Argentina caps, managed six goals and three assists in 35 appearances last season as the Foxes were relegated to the Championship. 

Chelsea have several members of staff who know Buonanotte well from their time at Brighton, including co-sporting director Paul Winstanley and director of global recruitment Sam Jewell. 

Meanwhile, fellow Brighton forward Julio Enciso is nearing a Â£13.8m move to Chelsea's partner club Strasbourg, with a view that he will play for the Blues after a year in France.

Chelsea have been looking to add attacking threat to their squad - looking towards Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons.

They have prioritised a Â£40m move for Manchester United winger Garnacho over Simons - who is set to complete a Â£51.8m move to Tottenham. 

But Chelsea face restraints in the transfer market, having been fined Â£26m by Uefa in July for breaching financial rules.

They are under pressure to maintain a "positive transfer balance" or risk being unable to register new signings for the Champions League league phase. 

It means that to bring players in, they have to get players out. So far this summer, they have raised a Premier League-record Â£265m from sales.

Noni Madueke's Â£52m move to Arsenal was the biggest sale, with more money raised by offloading Christopher Nkunku to AC Milan and Alfie Gilchrist to West Brom.

Chelsea remain in the selling market with Nicolas Jackson being courted by clubs in Italy, Germany and England, and Tyrique George, Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi among those who could leave before the transfer deadline on 1 September.

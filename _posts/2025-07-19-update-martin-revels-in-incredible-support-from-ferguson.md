Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sir Alex Ferguson was a guest at Rangers' training centre on Friday

Russell Martin says the support he has had from Sir Alex Ferguson since taking over as Rangers head coach has been "incredible".

The former Manchester United manager paid his first visit to the club's Auchenhowie training centre on Friday, in the company of Rangers great John Greig.

Ferguson, 83, played for two seasons at Rangers from 1967-69, while Greig, 82, spent his entire career at Ibrox before a five-year spell as manager.

"Any team talk or message I give is done when those two speak about this club and what it means to them," Martin told RangersTV.

"They are both really behind us and what we are doing. They are desperate for this team to do well.

"They feel the same way as the fans. They want to see a team that fights and works for everything and has a way about them on the pitch that exemplifies what they believe this club to be about."

Martin played under Sir Alex's son Darren Ferguson at Peterborough United who made him captain when he was just 21.

"He reached out and said his dad wanted to give me a call," Martin added.

"I said 'of course' and since then Sir Alex has been in touch regularly. He's been great. He's been so supportive of me personally, which is incredible.

"It's the first time he's been here and it was just brilliant for everyone to see him."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium has hosted international cricket, including during the 2023 World Cup

The Indian Premier League match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala was abandoned because of reported floodlight failure.

The players walked off the field after 10.1 overs with Kings on 122-1, having just seen Priyansh Arya dismissed for a 34-ball 70.

Arya had made a blistering opening stand alongside Prabhsimran Singh, who struck 50 from 28 deliveries, after their side chose to bat at the toss.

Two floodlight towers were inactive at the time the innings was postponed.

ESPN Cricinfo reported, external that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said the match was called off "due to a significant technical failure". 

The BBC has asked the BCCI for comment but has been unable to verify the reports. 

Earlier on Thursday, the BCCI moved Sunday's match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians from Dharamshala to Ahmedabad due to "logistical challenges". 

Dharamshala sits close to the contested region of Kashmir, subject of raised tensions between India and Pakistan in recent days.

Thursday's Pakistan Super League match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, due to be held in Rawalpindi, was postponed after Pakistan's military said Indian drones were destroyed in various Pakistan cities.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later announced it is moving the remainder of the PSL season to the United Arab Emirates amid the ongoing tensions.

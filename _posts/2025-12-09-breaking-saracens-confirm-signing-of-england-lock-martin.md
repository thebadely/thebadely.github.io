According to new developments, George Martin has only played 15 games for Leicester over the past two seasons

Saracens have confirmed the signing of Leicester's England lock George Martin.

The 24-year-old will join the London club in the summer, when his contract expires. He has spent his entire career so far with the Tigers.

Martin has scored nine tries in 73 appearances and was a member of Leicester's Premiership title-winning side of 2022.

He made his England debut against Ireland in March 2021 and has won 21 caps but is currently out of action because of a shoulder injury.

"George is a highly driven young player who we are delighted to welcome to the club," said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall.

"His attributes and character will complement and add value to the group and we are looking forward to him realising his potential in the years ahead."

Martin signed what was described as a "multi-year" contract with Leicester in December 2023.

The second-rower has not played since being forced off the pitch in England's Six Nations victory against France 10 months ago, and he is not expected to be available again until the end of January.

Leicester are fourth in the Prem Rugby table after four wins from six games so far, but they began their European Champions Cup campaign with a 39-20 defeat at La Rochelle on Saturday.

"We would have liked George to stay with the club as he's a top-quality player developed through our academy alongside many of the current team," said Leicester head coach Geoff Parling.

"While we offered George a competitive deal to remain with Tigers, he has chosen a different direction for the next stage of his career."

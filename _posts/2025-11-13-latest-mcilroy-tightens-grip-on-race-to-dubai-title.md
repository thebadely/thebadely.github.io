Let's dive into the details: Rory McIlroy has won six Race to Dubai titles

DP World Tour Championship leaderboard 

-8 M Kim (US); -7 T Fleetwood (Eng); -6 R McIlroy (NI), T Lawrence (SA), A Sullivan (Eng); -5 D Hillier (Aus), N Hojgaard (Den), B Robinson-Thompson (Eng)

Rory McIlroy made a confident start to his bid for a fourth consecutive Race to Dubai title with an accomplished opening round at the DP World Tour Championship. 

The Northern Irishman hit a six-under 66, leaving him joint-third and two strokes behind leader Michael Kim in the United Arab Emirates. 

McIlroy, who has a 767-point lead at the top of the season-long rankings, opened his round with three consecutive birdies as he aims for a seventh Race to Dubai title.

"I felt like that was probably one of the best approach-play rounds I've had in a long time. My wedge play felt really sharp. Had a lot of good iron shots," said McIlroy.

"I don't want to sound like I'm that disappointed but I feel like I left a few out there. I missed a couple of short ones. 

"Overall, it was a really solid start on a golf course that I'm very comfortable on and historically I've played very well on."

Only English duo Tyrrell Hatton and Marco Penge can prevent McIlroy from winning the season-long competition, formerly known as the European Tour's Order of Merit, but they sit joint-22nd and joint-46th respectively after the opening round.

McIlroy's Ryder Cup team-mate Tommy Fleetwood sits in second, one stroke ahead on seven-under-par.

The 2025 Tour Championship winner hit five birdies over a six-hole stretch down the back nine, helping him leapfrog McIlroy on the leaderboard. 

"I feel like it was a really good day," said Fleetwood.

"I didn't think it was that easy. There are some really good scores out there. There were some really demanding shots on that back nine and I felt like I got into a really good rhythm.

"Drove it as good as I've drove it all year. It was a really good driving day. I made two or three good par saves, which is key."

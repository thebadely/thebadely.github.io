Experts revealed that Two women's alleged stalking of the McCanns was "cruel and unforgiving" and showed no sign of stopping, prosecutors told a trial.

Michael Duck KC said evidence showed Polish national Julia Wandelt, who has claimed to be missing Madeleine McCann since 2022, was "capable of being incredibly manipulative".

Addressing the jury at Leicester Crown Court, he said Karen Spragg, 61, who helped arrange a doorstep confrontation at the McCanns' home to ask for a DNA test, was "no sidekick" and been a "willing participant" with a "preconceived notion" of the unsolved disappearance in Portugal in 2007.

Both deny stalking Gerry and Kate McCann causing serious alarm and distress over two-and-a-half years.

A letter Mr Duck said was "co-authored" by the two defendants, signed by Miss Wandelt as Madeleine and hand delivered to the McCanns' address in December 2024, a day after they were told to stop trying to contact them, showed the pair's "torment" of the family "was not going to stop".

He said any suggestion having a DNA test carried out would have ceased their stalking was "a nonsense".

Mr Duck pointed to Miss Wandelt's refusal to accept "the game was finally up" when told about the DNA result in April this year.

When he suggested Miss Wandelt's supposed childhood memories as Madeleine McCann were "a manifestation" and details came from the McCann's home videos which were published online, Miss Wandelt became emotional and left the dock in tears.

He also highlighted a shift from signing messages as Madeleine and calling Mrs McCann "mommy" to Mrs Spragg messaging Mrs McCann to say Miss Wandelt only "believes she may be" the missing girl.

He said: "These two operated together, and had an ability and a willingness to manipulate.

"It's absolutely plain there never was and never could be evidence that supported their belief based on nothing other than her own assertions.

"Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann, and the only people who are not prepared to accept that are the two sat in the dock."

Addressing the jury, judge Mrs Justice Cutts KC said that anyone with opinions on the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 should "put them to one side" and solely consider evidence heard during the trial.

She added both defendants are of previous good character, with just one prior caution on Mrs Spragg's record from 2006 for slapping a neighbour on the back of their head during an argument.

The best friend of Karen Spragg told the trial the 61-year-old was "sincere, reliable and most definitely honest".

A character reference from care worker Susan Aherne, Karen Spragg's friend of 40 years, was read to the court telling of a "genuine person" who would "listen wholeheartedly and give support".

Julia Wandelt, 24, of Jana Kochanowskiego in Lubin, Poland, and Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau Court Road, Cardiff, deny stalking the McCanns causing distress and alarm between June 2022 to February 2025.

The trial continues.

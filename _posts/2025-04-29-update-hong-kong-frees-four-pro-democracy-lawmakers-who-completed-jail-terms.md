It has been recently reported that Hong Kong has released four former opposition lawmakers who were among dozens of pro-democracy leaders jailed under the city's controversial National Security Law (NSL).

The four -  Claudia Mo, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Gary Fan - had pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to four years and two months behind bars in November. 

They were released on Tuesday because the fact they had been in prison since their arrests in 2021 was taken into account when calculating their sentence. 

The four lawmakers were part of a group known as the Hong Kong 47.  They were accused of trying to overthrow the government by running an unofficial primary to pick opposition candidates for local elections. 

Police said they had left their correctional facilities early on Tuesday. 

This was the biggest trial under the national security law (NSL) which China imposed on the city shortly after explosive pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in a months-long standoff against Beijing. Triggered by a proposed government treaty that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, the protests quickly grew to reflect wider demands for democratic reform.

Beijing and Hong Kong authorities argue the law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened autonomy.

But critics have called it "the end of Hong Kong" and say it has created a climate of fear in the city.

The Hong Kong 47 included famous figures like Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, who were icons of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong.

Others were arrested after they stormed the city's Legislative Council (LegCo) and spray-painted Hong Kong's emblem in what became a pivotal moment in the 2019 protests.

A total of 45 people were jailed for conspiring to commit subversion. Two of the defendants were acquitted in May.

The sentences were widely condemned by the international community including the UK and the US. 

Claudia Mo, known affectionately in Cantonese as Auntie Mo, is among the most well known of the group. 

A prominent opposition lawmaker, the 67-year-old helped set up the now disbanded opposition Civic Party in 2006 and by 2012 she had won a seat in LegCo. 

She was among 15 lawmakers who resigned en masse from LegCo after four pro-democracy lawmakers were ousted in November 2020. The move left LegCo with no opposition presence.

Kwok Ka-ki and Jeremy Tam were also former Civic Party lawmakers. Gary Fan was a co-founder of another opposition party, the Neo Democrats.

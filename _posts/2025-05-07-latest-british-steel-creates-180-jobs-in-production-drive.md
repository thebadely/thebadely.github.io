Experts revealed that British Steel is to "ramp up" production and create more than 180 jobs.

The company said the majority of the roles would be based at Scunthorpe, with the rest at the Teesside and Skinningrove plants.

Officials said there would be a "wide variety" of opportunities, including jobs in engineering, cleaning and workplace safety, as well as legal roles.

Plans to make 2,700 workers redundant were scrapped last month after the government took control of the company from its Chinese owner, Jingye.

Allan Bell, the company's interim chief executive, said the new roles would help to "build stronger futures" for British Steel and the UK economy.

"With the backing of the government, we are focused on cementing British Steel as one of the world's leading manufacturers of steel," he said.

"To help achieve this, and meet customer demand, we will be upping production across all our sites and recruiting more than 180 people to help drive us forward."

The BBC has been told 165 of the 182 jobs will be in Scunthorpe, with 17 at Teesside and Skinningrove.

An open day for prospective applicants will be held at the Scunthorpe Conference Centre, on Brigg Road, on 17 May between 10:00 and 16:00 BST.

Last month, the government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that Jingye was planning to switch off two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe.

The closure of the furnaces would have left the UK without the capability to produce "virgin" steel, which is used in major construction projects such as new buildings and railways.

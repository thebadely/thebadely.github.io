India bowled United Arab Emirates out for 57 to begin the defence of their Asia Cup title with a rapid nine-wicket victory in Dubai.

On the ground where India won the Champions Trophy earlier this year, UAE reached 47-2 but lost their last eight wickets for 10 runs across five overs.

India wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav took 4-7 in 2.1 overs, including three in his second over. 

Opener Alishan Sharafu, who made 22 before being bowled by Jasprit Bumrah, and captain Muhammad Waseem, who reached 19 only to be pinned lbw by Kuldeep, were the only UAE batters to make double figures. 

The total was the lowest made against India in T20s.

Opener Abhishek Sharma then hit the first ball of the chase for six and the second for four as the defending champions took just 4.3 overs to complete victory.

Abhishek hit two more sixes and a further four in crashing 30 from 16 balls before skying a catch off seamer Junaid Siddique with 10 runs needed.

Shubman Gill, playing for the first time since the dramatic fifth Test against England at The Oval, finished unbeaten on 20 from nine balls and made captain Suryakumar Yadav seven not out from two.

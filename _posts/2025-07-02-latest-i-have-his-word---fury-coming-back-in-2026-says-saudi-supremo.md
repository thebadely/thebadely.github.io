According to new developments, Tyson Fury lost to Oleksandr Usyk in Riyadh in May and December 2024

Former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will come out of retirement in 2026, Saudi boxing power broker Turki Alalshikh appeared to claim on Wednesday.

Fury, 36, retired from boxing in January after losing a title fight rematch with Oleksandr Usyk by unanimous decision the previous month.

"The 'Gypsy King' will be back," Alalshikh said in a post on X.

"I talked with him, and I have his word to have him in Riyadh season in 2026. We have a rabbit to hunt."

Fury often referred to Usyk as a "rabbit" in the build-up to their title fights, both of which were held in the Saudi capital Riyadh.

The Ukrainian won their first encounter in May 2024 by split decision to become the heavyweight division's first undisputed four-belt champion.

In a post on Instagram, Fury wrote "Let's see what 2026 brings" over a photo of him shaking hands with Alalshikh, who is chairman of Saudi Arabia's general entertainment authority.

Alalshikh has been a key figure in the rise of boxing in Saudi Arabia, bringing a string of high-profile fights to the country.

However, earlier on Wednesday Fury suggested he might be more interested in fighting on home soil.

"Who would I rather fight, right now? Usyk. Because I want my revenge in England," he told reporters at an International Boxing Association event in Istanbul.

"I don't believe I've got a fair shout the last two times. That's all I want. I want a fair shout, and I don't believe I've got a fair shout the last two times.

"That's the one I want, but if I don't get that then it'd be [Anthony] Joshua, the biggest British fight that will ever happen.

"It would break all records, and it would sell out 100,000 at Wembley in an hour. And it's a fight I think can happen, for sure, if I decide to come back."

Fury is yet to fight Joshua, who was stopped by compatriot Daniel Dubois at Wembley in September, his most recent outing.

Usyk will become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion should he defeat Dubois at Wembley on Saturday, 19 July.

Here’s what you need to know: When Charlie was 21 years old, he attempted to take his own life after becoming homeless for the third time. The 23-year-old has since represented Great Britain in international ice skating, saying the sport has "changed his life".

Charlie, originally from Brighton, moved in with his grandmother when he was 13 after feeling pressure to come out as gay, which created a rift with his family.

After his grandmother died when he was 17, he became homeless for the first time and would sleep on friends' sofas.

He eventually got a private tenancy, but was unable to keep up with the cost of the rent, which led to him becoming homeless again.

"I really struggled with the instability of sofa-surfing, especially after having my own place and living independently," he said.

"It felt like a step backwards and it was much harder than I anticipated going back to a lifestyle I thought I'd left behind -  it felt like it was never going to end."

In 2023, he moved to Sheffield with his boyfriend, but became homeless for the third time after the relationship broke down.

During this period, he attempted to take his own life.

He was referred to the South Yorkshire youth homelessness charity Roundabout, which assigned him a flat - in which he still lives - and gave him access to a counselling service.

"I've thrived as a person up in Sheffield, down south I'm just a shell and don't feel like a person or appreciated, but up here I have so much more to live for and I'm treated with respect," he said.

He said he felt "lonely" after moving into the flat and decided to try ice skating to "make some friends".

"I very quickly got addicted to it and wanted to do competitions," he said.

Charlie represented Great Britain at the Celje Ice Cup in Slovenia last month.

He won gold medals in the artistic performance and free skating categories, and hopes to one day make it to the Olympics.

"It isn't just about skating though - it's taught me discipline and respect for myself," he said.

"It's helped me understand my feelings and how to portray them, it's so hard to open up about how I feel, but I can express who I am through my skating."

He now practises for 20 hours every week alongside working and studying at Doncaster College.

"I train mainly at Ice Sheffield and it's crazy to think that I have come this far in two years," he said.

"I wasn't expecting a medal at all and even when I heard the scores I had to check online to make sure I really had won - I didn't think I'd do so well."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Huw Jones has formed a fine centre partnership for club and country with Sione Tuipulotu

Glasgow head coach Franco Smith is confident Huw Jones will be fit for this summer's British and Irish Lions tour of Australia despite the recurrence of a niggling Achilles injury.

The centre will miss Warriors' United Rugby Championship quarter-final against the Stormers at Scotstoun on Friday night.

Smith has confirmed it is the same issue that sidelined Jones for two months after Scotland's Six Nations campaign.

"It flares up every now and then and it's just too close to the game to recover," Smith told BBC Scotland.

"It was better to make the call earlier in the week, so that we can be best prepared, but at the same time you can be recovered and hopefully as soon as possible.

"The whole season he needs to be managed. He came back from the Six Nations with that problem, and it's just the same one that's flared up now.

"Our medical team is on it and they're trying to find solutions to make sure he's back as soon as possible."

The Lions play their first warm-up match against Argentina in Dublin on 20 June before departing for Australia and Smith played down fears Jones' participation could be in doubt.

"Yes, I definitely think so," Smith said when asked if Jones will be available for the tour.

"I hope we will have him back sooner. Let's see what the medical side of things say. All the anti-inflammatory treatment helps to get him back onto the pitch as soon as possible."

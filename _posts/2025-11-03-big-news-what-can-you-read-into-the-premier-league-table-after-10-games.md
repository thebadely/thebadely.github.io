It has been recently reported that Will Arsenal become the 15th team to top the table after 10 games and win the title?

We are now over a quarter of the way through the Premier League season, with each team having played 10 games.

So what can we read into it?

History suggests the answer is quite a lot. 

Last season, for instance, only two teams finished more than five places away from their position at this stage.

And already at least one title contender and relegation battler would have to do something nobody has ever done before.

BBC Sport has a look.

How Premier League table looks after 10 games

Arsenal are top of the Premier League on 25 points - which is about the average (24.7) for the eventual champions to have after 10 games.

In 14 of the 33 Premier League seasons to date the team top at this stage have gone on to win the title.

But only seven times has a team on 19 points, the tally of second-placed Manchester City, or 18 points, which is what Liverpool, Sunderland and Bournemouth are on, after 10 games won the title.

Nobody has ever done it from fewer points, which would 'rule out' any other hopefuls.

Arsenal lead City by six points, which is the exact most points a team have ever come from behind at this stage to win a title.

Manchester United in 2002-03 and Manchester City in 2013-14 are the two to do that.

But if you believe in omens, this might not be a good one for the Gunners...

That season City did it, they had 19 points and Arsenal had 25. The exact same totals as this season.

The Gunners ended up finishing fourth.

Wolves' record of two points after 10 games has meant relegation every time it has ever happened in the Premier League.

Four teams have done it from a position of three points at this stage, including Wolves last season.

That was under Gary O'Neil, with Vitor Pereira taking over and leading them to safety. Pereira has just been sacked, with O'Neil pulling out of advanced talks to return to Molineux.

Nottingham Forest, on six points, and West Ham, on seven points, are also in the relegation zone, but plenty of teams have stayed up from there.

In each of the past two seasons, the three promoted teams have gone straight back down without much of a fight.

But this season they are doing much better and none are in the bottom three after 10 games.

Sunderland are fourth in the table. No promoted team have ever ended up going back down after picking up their 18 points after 10 games.

Leeds (11 points) and Burnley (10 points) are already on double figures and sit in the two positions above the relegation zone.

The last promoted side to have 11 or more points after 10 games and be relegated was Cardiff in 2013-14.

Several teams, including Leicester last season, have gone down after earning 10 points at this stage.

Last season only two teams finished more than five positions away from where they were after 10 games.

The biggest change saw Tottenham drop from seventh to 17th as Ange Postecoglou apperared to prioritise the Europa League.

Newcastle rose six places to fifth, Crystal Palace moved up five places and Wolves rose four spots to stay up, with Nottingham Forest dropping the same amount.

Champions Liverpool, Chelsea (fourth), Aston Villa (sixth), Brighton (eighth) and West Ham (14th) all stayed in the same position.

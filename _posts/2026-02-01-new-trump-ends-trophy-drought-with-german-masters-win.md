According to new developments, The win gives Trump his 31st ranking event success

World number one Judd Trump claimed his first trophy since the UK Championship in November 2024 with a 10-4 victory over Shaun Murphy in the German Masters final in Berlin.

It is a record-extending fourth title in the event for Trump, who also won in 2020, 2021 and 2024.

The 36-year-old won the first two frames of the match with breaks of 101 and 71 only for Murphy to level it at 2-2 before Trump pulled away again to lead 5-3 at the interval.

Former world champion Murphy had been hoping to win the event's Brandon Parker Trophy which commemorates his friend and manager who had been a key figure in promoting the Berlin tournament before he died of cancer in 2020.

He started the evening session with intent and a break of 60 left him in control of the ninth frame only for Trump to return to the table and clear it to start a run of four consecutive frames and move close to victory.

Although Murphy gave himself a glimmer of hope coming from 51 points down to snatch frame 13 on the black, Trump got over the line in the next.

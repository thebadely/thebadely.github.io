Let's dive into the details: Alfie Hewett was hoping to make up for missing out on the men's double's title on Saturday

Great Britain's Alfie Hewett was unable to defend his wheelchair singles title at Wimbledon after he was beaten by world number one Tokito Oda.

In a contest of the highest quality, Oda fought back from losing the opener to triumph 3-6 7-5 6-2.

It was the 19-year-old's second Wimbledon title, having also beaten Hewett in 2023, and sixth overall Grand Slam success.

While disappointed to lose, Hewett was full of praise for the backing from fans on Court One.

"To experience tennis matches like this is what we dream of. Win or lose that is the real winner today," said the 27-year-old, who also lost in the doubles final with Gordon Reid.

"I don't think trophies can beat this sort of atmosphere and support. It is incredible. Last year was obviously such a special moment for me, my family and my team.

"When you lose, to have this amount of love and support, this sort of atmosphere doesn't happen to us on a regular basis.

"It is really incredible the amount of support wheelchair tennis has got."

From the moment the pair broke each other's first service game it was clear this was going to be a tight and tense contest between two players who regularly meet at this stage of Grand Slams.

This was the seventh time in the last 10 major finals that they had faced each other and the exchange of breaks continued in a tight first set until Hewett broke in the seventh game, held and then took the first set with a fourth consecutive break.

The second set was even closer, with more breaks of serve from both players. It seemed destined to go to a tie-break as Hewett had break point with Oda leading 6-5, but the Japanese player raised his level once more to fend it off and level matters.

From then on he had the momentum as the exertion of a gruelling second set seemed to have taken its toll on Hewett. After getting the first break in the third game of the decider, Oda was in full control.

Hewett, lifted by the noise of the crowd, fended off match point on his serve, but it merely delayed Oda's win as he showed his quality to get over the line.

"Two years ago I won here, this tournament is different to others, it is so beautiful," he said. "I really appreciate this moment."

Meanwhile, Niels Vink won the Wimbledon quad singles title by defeating fellow Dutchman Sam Schroder 6-3 6-3 on court three.

The 22-year-old Vink, seeded first, added the prize to the doubles crown he won alongside Guy Sasson.

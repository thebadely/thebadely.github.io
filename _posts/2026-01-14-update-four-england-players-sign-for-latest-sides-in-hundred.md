According to new developments, Phil Salt (left), Sophia Dunkley (centre left), Ben Duckett (centre right) and Lauren Filer (right) have all moved to new sides for the 2026 Hundred

Phil Salt has signed for Welsh Fire as their captain for the 2026 Hundred season, while fellow England openers Ben Duckett and Sophia Dunkley have joined Trent Rockets and Birmingham Phoenix have added seamer Lauren Filer.

Salt has substantial global franchise experience, including in the Indian Premier League, and has made 1,540 runs at 38.50 in 50 T20 internationals for England.

The 29-year-old, who was born in north Wales, signs from Manchester Originals, where he has spent his entire Hundred career to date.

"Joining Welsh Fire represents a very exciting new challenge, and I will take great pride in playing in Wales," said Salt.

"It's always special to play at Sophia Gardens, a place that holds so many great memories for me. 

"Becoming the first Welsh captain to lead England on Welsh soil was a real honour, and getting the T20 win against Australia made it even more satisfying."

Welsh Fire men's team head coach Mike Hussey, who is set to be supported by Ricky Ponting in a strategic role, added: "Phil signing on as captain is great news for Welsh Fire. 

"We've worked and enjoyed success together before, so I know from experience what he can bring to the group. 

"Phil's strengths and firepower with the bat makes him a really exciting addition to the top order of any squad. I'm sure the fans can't wait to see him step out for us as a proud Welshman in 2026."

New Trent Rockets batter Duckett, 31, endured a difficult Ashes series in Australia, averaging just 20.2, but has established himself as one of the world's leading all-format opening batters in recent years.

The left-hander, who joins from Birmingham Phoenix, already knows Trent Bridge well, having played county cricket for Nottinghamshire since 2018.

"Trent Bridge is already my home in so many different ways, so signing for the Rockets feels like a full circle moment, and I'm absolutely delighted," said Duckett.

"Without doubt, it's my favourite ground to play at in England, and I can't wait to play for the Rockets in front of the best fans in the country too."

Dunkley, an England regular since making her international debut in 2021, joins from Welsh Fire.

The 27-year-old batter has scored 1,065 runs in The Hundred at an average of 31.32 with seven half-centuries.

"The platform that The Hundred has given the women's game so far has been immense, and it's an incredibly exciting time, so I can't wait to see what lies in store with the Rockets," she said.

Rockets head coach Chris Read added: "Sophia will be a brilliant addition to our squad, and brings proven run-scoring ability coupled with valuable experience."

England's Filer, one of the fastest bowlers in the women's game, joins Ellyse Perry and fellow new signing Alice Capsey in the Phoenix squad.

The 25-year-old joins from Manchester Originals, where she spent two years following single seasons at London Spirit and Welsh Fire.

She averaged 12.12 with the ball for Originals in 2025, taking eight wickets in six matches.

"Lauren is an exciting young bowler with genuine pace and real competitiveness in her game," said Phoenix women's head coach Ali Maiden.

"She brings an aggressive mindset and control that we believe will be crucial in The Hundred."

"I'm really pleased to be joining Birmingham Phoenix," said Filer. 

"I've always loved playing at Edgbaston where the atmosphere is incredible. I can't wait to get started with the team, bowl in front of the Phoenix fans, and contribute to what I know will be a strong season."

Teams have been limited to four signings for the 2026 season, with all remaining players set to be allocated to squads in a new auction format. 

England batter Jacob Bethell and spinner Rehan Ahmed have signed for Phoenix's men's side.

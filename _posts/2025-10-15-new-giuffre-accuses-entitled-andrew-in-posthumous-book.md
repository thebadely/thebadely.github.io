Here’s what you need to know: A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre accuses the Duke of York of being "entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright", according to extracts published in the Guardian newspaper.

The book, Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is due to be published next week, almost six months after Ms Giuffre took her own life.

Her book, which calls Epstein a "master manipulator", describes three occasions where she alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her, including at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London. 

It's further embarrassment for Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, and has always denied any wrongdoing.

Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, is the testimony of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in Australia in April, in a book co-written with author Amy Wallace.

Ms Giuffre, who met Jeffrey Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.

The powerful friends were claimed to include Prince Andrew and the extract published in the Guardian gives her account of when they met in London in March 2001, when she was aged 17.

She says the day began by being woken by Ghislaine Maxwell: "It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince!"

When Andrew arrived later she claims that he was asked to guess her age. 

"The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. 'My daughters are just a little younger than you,' he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: 'I guess we will have to trade her in soon.'," says her memoir.

Like Epstein, she said she called him "Andy".

There is also an account of the notorious photograph from that evening.

"My mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture. 

"I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo," she writes.

They went to dinner and then Tramp nightclub, she recalls, saying Andrew was a "bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely". 

"On the way back, Maxwell told me, 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey'."

She says of what happened next: "He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright."

As has been reported before, she claimed he was "particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches". And that later Epstein gave her $15,000 for her time with Andrew.

The book also reports two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.

All three of the claimed meetings with Andrew have been reported in detail before, including in her previous witness statements and accounts, but this brings them together and provides her own perspective.

"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn't hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch," she writes.

The book also reveals that she was taking tranquilisers to cope with her life working for Epstein.

"Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day," she writes.

She also explained why she didn't leave "Epstein's lair even after we knew what he wanted from us." 

"How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable," she writes.

"Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care."

After leaving Epstein, Ms Giuffre had settled in Australia where she lived with her husband and three children. She took her own life at the age of 41.

Epstein had killed himself in jail in New York in while awaiting trial. Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed on charges related to sex trafficking.

Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement, after she had brought a civil case against him, and he denies all the accusations made against him.

He refutes Ms Giuffre's claims about having sex with him at the three locations: "I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened," Andrew said in his BBC Newsnight interview.

"I can tell you categorically I don't remember meeting her at all. I do not remember a photograph being taken and I've said consistently and frequently that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever," he said.

Prince Andrew has faced challenges over aspects of his own account.

He said he had cut all links with Epstein after seeing him in New York in December 2010, but an email later emerged from February 2011 which suggested Andrew was still in touch, with the promise to "play some more soon".

The Duke of York's office has been contacted for comment.

According to new developments, Rublev reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2023

For world number 14 Andrey Rublev, success at Wimbledon looks like one of two things.

Win - or "lose it in a mature, adult way".

Mature is perhaps not always the word that has been associated with Rublev. Prone to outbursts and temper tantrums, the eccentric character has often found himself in the headlines for his volatile behaviour rather than his on-court talent.

But the 27-year-old has been working on controlling his emotions.

Bringing two-time major champion Marat Safin, no stranger to an on-court outburst himself, on board has helped Rublev address those problems.

That built-up resilience will be put to the test on Sunday with the toughest of challenges ahead in round four - defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Rublev has never gone beyond a quarter-final of a Grand Slam, losing 10 times at this stage.

But in the context of his mental battles, this time last year at the All England Club marked a particular low point. He went out in the first round and made headlines for repeatedly smashing his racquet into his leg in frustration.

That was just one incident of many like it.

Last year he was disqualified from the Dubai Tennis Championships for screaming in the face of a line judge following a disputed call in the semi-final against Alexander Bublik, losing all his prize money and ranking points for the week.

That decision was later overturned with points and money reinstated, but the persistent outbursts sparked concern among peers and fans.

At the Paris Masters he drew blood again from smashing his racquet into his knee.

Rublev has cited last year's SW19 moment when he knew things needed to change and has since opened up about his mental health struggles.

"I would say it was not dealing with the issue of losing or not losing, it was not the issue even of tennis," he revealed.

"I was just dealing with myself, just to face myself, to stop running away from myself and I was just dealing with that. What's happening inside of me, why I feel this, why I feel that, why I am doing this?"

Away from the court, Rublev is a popular character on the Tour. He has frequently expressed his opposition to the war in Ukraine, while he also set up a clothing brand, which he wears for his matches, where all profits are used to help children with critical illnesses.

But being kinder to himself has been an issue and working more frequently with a psychologist, combined with the addition of Safin to his coaching set-up, proved crucial.

"Marat is a huge help to me. He has given some advice and said some things, but he does it not in a soft way," explained Rublev.

"He's super strict - he gives you the heavy truth."

Safin, a former world number one and winner of the US Open and Australian Open, was notorious for his temper, estimating he smashed 700 racquets in his career.

That level of passion, and sheer yearning to succeed, which the two share is never going to be stamped out all together.

But while Rublev has yet to win a Tour title this season, he showed improved control over his emotions at the Doha Open by winning three consecutive three-set matches, despite dropping the second set in all three and winning dramatic final-set tie-breaks in two of them.

"I know that everything is connected. If you feel some problems with yourself, it will affect everything," he added.

"Sooner or later you will have problems with your family, with relationships, with work, everywhere. When you have peace with yourself, then the rest takes cares of itself."

But Rublev has learned to understand it doesn't have to all be about winning. For now at least, that is enough.

"There are two options," he said. "Try to go deeper. Or if I lose, to lose it in a mature, adult way. 

"That would be success as well, to lose it in the right way."

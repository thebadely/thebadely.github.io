Experts revealed that A care home has taken its love for The Traitors reality television show a step further by creating its own version.

Residents at Parkfield Grange Care Home in Stourbridge, West Midlands, can get involved in a live action spin-off of the BBC One competition in a game specially tailored for older people.

Over the course of 10 days, residents will embark on missions, oval table discussions, and murder-mystery style activities.

To coincide with the programme, the care home's game is set to start on Wednesday leading up to a finale on 23 January.

Throughout the game, there will be scavenger hunts using video calls where residents get the chance to solve puzzles and riddles then send staff off to find the next clue.

The catering team has also created taste-based challenges and there will be observation games set around the home.

In a Parkfield Grange twist, the home said no-one will be excluded from the game and residents who are eliminated instead become guardians of the game, gaining an extra role in helping to spot the Traitors.

Emily Hocking, the home's admissions adviser, said: "The residents have regular forums with our wellbeing team and one of the topics was a murder mystery, and I had just finished catching up on an episode of Traitors so I sat down and wrote some ideas and the game has evolved.

"We have made some adaptations to ensure that there is constant resident inclusion, one of the key differences we have made is replacing murders with eliminations so anyone that is banished becomes the eyes and ears for the faithful so they can continue to play and not feel excluded in their own home."

The winning team who remains in active play will be given an afternoon tea for themselves and two guests in the home's private dining room.

Hocking added: "There is a pre-conceived idea of what being in a care home is like and it's our responsibility to make sure that our residents are living and not existing. 

"It's important that they stay involved in current events and culture."

Hosted by Claudia Winkleman, The Traitors series four sees 22 people from across the UK descend on a Scottish Castle to try and win up to £120,000.

The Traitors continues on BBC One and iPlayer on 14 January at 8pm.

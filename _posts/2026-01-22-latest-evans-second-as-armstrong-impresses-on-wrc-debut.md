According to new developments, Jon Armstrong was sixth on the opening stage and was third fastest in the second to move into third place overall

Jon Armstrong sits in fifth place after three stages of his World Rally Championship debut at the iconic Rallye Monte Carlo.

The M-Sport Ford driver was sixth on the opening stage and was third fastest on the ice-covered second stage to move into third place overall.

Safety concerns amid heavy fog forced the third stage to be halted and Armstrong, who was midway through the stage when it was stopped, was awarded a notional time - which is given by rally officials for drivers who do not complete a stage under exceptional circumstances.

A slower nominal time than expected dropped him from the podium to fifth overall but it was still a superb first day in rallying's top tier for the Northern Ireland driver.

The 31-year-old is one minute and 34.5 seconds behind rally leader Oliver Solberg, who set a stunning time in the second stage to overhaul Toyota team-mate Elfyn Evans, after the Wales driver was fastest on Thursday's opener.

Evans was one of a number of drivers who complained about poor visibility before the stage was stopped.

"I couldn't see anything, so it was probably the right decision [to stop the stage]," said Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Armstrong.

"It's a good start for the first day in Rally1 and the first day of Monte-Carlo and I know I can drive, but it's mostly the things around it that make me nervous."

Reigning champion Sebastien Ogier is third after topping the final stage before it was stopped.

Motorsport Ireland's Josh McErlean had an early crash as he spun off the icy road on the second stage, clipped a tree and got stuck in a ditch, while Finland's Sami Pajari suffered a similar fate with a broken wheel on his Toyota.

McErlean will return to the rally after his accident.

The rally resumes with six stages on Friday, and the event ends with four stages each on Saturday and Sunday.

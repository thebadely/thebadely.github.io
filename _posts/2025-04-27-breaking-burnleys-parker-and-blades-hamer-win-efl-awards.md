Let's dive into the details: Gustavo Hamer has contributed to 16 goals for Sheffield United from midfield this season

Burnley boss Scott Parker and Sheffield United midfielder Gustavo Hamer have been named the Championship manager and player of the year.

Parker has guided the Clarets back to the Premier League, breaking multiple records along the way, including the most clean sheets (30) and fewest goals conceded (15) - while they could yet still match Reading's 33-game unbeaten record set in 2005-06.

Hamer has produced one of the best seasons of his career with nine goals and seven assists to help the Blades to a third-place finish, missing out on automatic promotion despite amassing 89 points with a game to spare.

Birmingham City's Chris Davies won the League One manager of the year award after leading the Blues to the title and an instant return to the Championship, while Wycombe's 18-goal striker Richard Kone picked up the player and young player awards.

Bradford City boss Graham Alexander and Bromley forward Michael Cheek, who has netted a division-high 23 goals in the club's debut EFL season, scooped League Two's manager and player of the year prizes.

The 97 points Burnley have already achieved is the highest Parker has managed as a head coach, exceeding his tally when he took Fulham (81) up via the play-offs in 2019-20, and when he won automatic promotion with Bournemouth (88) in 2021-22.

Scott Parker has won promotion to the Premier League three times as a manager

"I am really proud of that [the points tally]," Parker told BBC Sport.

"To think that we're on target if we can go and win at the weekend, a 100-point tally is a huge achievement.

"That, along with everything else that comes with it in terms of the unbeaten record now of 32 games, the clean sheets, the goals conceded.

"This [promotion] is right up there because of the journey we've been on. This is a team that was practically put together in the last week of the transfer window and to come together like they have makes me immensely proud of them."

Parker, 44, took over at Turf Moor at the beginning of the season and edged out Daniel Farke of title rivals Leeds United, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Sunderland head coach Regis Le Bris to win the award.

Burnley's astonishing defensive record meant goalkeeper James Trafford and centre-back pair Maxime Esteve and CJ Egan-Riley were named in the Championship team of the year, which also featured Leeds full-back Jayden Bogle, midfielder Ao Tanaka and winger Dan James.

Brazil-born Dutchman Hamer has been the orchestrator of a Sheffield United team that have won 28 games - more than any other side in the Championship - as he saw off Trafford and James to win the award.

"I feel delighted, I'm buzzing," Hamer, 27, said. "Except from promotion as a team, this is the best reward you can get as a player.

"You can't do it without your team, we need each other. I can't thank my team-mates enough to get this prize.

"I speak a lot with our captain Jack Robinson and he said to me last week 'we need you more than ever at the moment'. That gives you a boost as player that the captain is giving you responsibility.

"I can be really happy with how I've done so far but we're not done yet."

Sunderland midfielders Chris Rigg and Jobe Bellingham have 12 goal contributions between them this season

Sunderland duo Jobe Bellingham and Chris Rigg won the young player and apprentice of the season awards for the Championship, having helped the Black Cats into the play-offs.

Birmingham boss Davies has overseen a dominant season, racking up 105 points with two games still to play - a third-tier record since the introduction of three points for a win.

Blues defenders Christoph Klarer and Alex Cochrane and midfielder Tomoki Iwata also made the League One team of the year.

Davies beat Phil Parkinson, who has led runners-up Wrexham to three successive promotions, Charlton boss Nathan Jones and Leyton Orient's Richie Wellens to the award.

"My first season as a manager couldn't have gone any better but for the club, I'm really pleased we bounced back into the Championship and we've won it in style," Davies said.

"It's been a fantastic season, capped off by getting the points record."

Double award winner Kone, who was playing in the ninth tier of English football only 13 months ago, said: "It's an unbelievable achievement. I wouldn't have thought of this a few years ago.

"To be standing there with not one but two awards and in the team of the year is well is just an amazing achievement. I am really proud of myself and enjoying the moment."

The EFL goal of the season went to Notts County's on-loan Tottenham midfielder George Abbott for his phenomenal volley into the top corner at Accrington in League Two in January.

Norwich strike partners Josh Sargent and Borja Sainz, who have scored 32 goals between them, were named in the Championship team of the season

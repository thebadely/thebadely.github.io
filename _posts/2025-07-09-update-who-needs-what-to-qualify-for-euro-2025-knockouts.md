Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England and Wales still have work to do to reach the Euro 2025 quarter-finals

England will reach the Euro 2025 quarter-finals if they beat Wales in their final Group D match on Sunday.

The defending champions would have been on the brink of elimination had they lost to the Netherlands on Wednesday, but instead produced a brilliant 4-0 win to keep their fate in their own hands.

Wales, bottom of Group D, are set for an early exit after losing to France on Wednesday - they now need to beat England by a huge margin to have a chance of going through. 

BBC Sport looks at how each of the four groups are shaping up - and who needs what to reach the quarter-finals. 

Euro 2025 TV & BBC radio schedule

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): England v Wales & Netherlands v France (both 13 July, 20:00)

England, who won the tournament in 2022, will advance if they beat tournament debutants Wales no matter the result in the Netherlands' match with France.

If the Lionesses fail to beat Wales, they may still reach the quarter-finals if other results go their way.

Wales are on the brink of elimination after defeat to France on Wednesday night. 

They would need to beat England by at least four goals because of their unfavourable head-to-head goal difference in matches involving themselves, the defending champions and the Netherlands.

France booked their spot in the quarter-finals after picking up three points against Wales. A point against the Netherlands will secure top spot.

The Netherlands will advance if they beat France on Sunday and England don't beat Wales. A draw will take the Dutch through if England lose.

If England, France and the Netherlands all finish on six points, the Netherlands are likely to be the side that misses out on head-to-head results because of their heavy defeat by England.

At this tournament, teams level on points are separated by head-to-head record. And if three teams are level on points, their head-to-head record is calculated as if they were in a mini-league.

Through to the quarter-finals: Norway, Spain, Germany, Sweden, France

Out: Iceland, Belgium, Denmark, Poland

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Finland v Switzerland & Norway v Iceland (both 10 July, 20:00)

Norway became the first team to secure their place in the quarter-finals with a win over Finland on Sunday, combined with Switzerland's victory. They are guaranteed top spot because of their head-to-head record against both teams.

Hosts Switzerland go into the final round of games knowing a point would ensure they progress via goal difference.

Finland need to beat Switzerland to go through.

Iceland are eliminated. 

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Italy v Spain & Portugal v Belgium (both 11 July, 20:00)

Spain progressed following the second round of group games, after they beat Belgium and Portugal failed to win against Italy.

The Spanish will win Group B if they avoid defeat against Italy in the final round of games.

Italy will go through as group winners if they beat Spain, or as runners-up if they avoid defeat.

Portugal can only progress as runners-up if they beat Belgium, Italy lose to Spain and there is a six-goal swing between them and the Italians.

Belgium are out.

Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Poland v Denmark & Sweden v Germany (both 12 July, 20:00)

Germany and Sweden both secured spots in the quarter-finals on Tuesday with wins over Denmark and Poland respectively.

The pair face each other in the final round of fixtures where the victor will advance as Group C winner and the loser as runner-up. Should the two teams draw, Sweden will top the group on goal difference.

Denmark and Poland were both eliminated with defeats on Tuesday.

The top two teams from each of the four groups will progress to the quarter-finals, with the sides in third and fourth eliminated. 

If two or more teams in the same group are equal on points at the end of the phase, the following criteria will determine their rankings:

Most points won in matches between those teams

Goal difference in matches between those teams

Goals scored in matches between those teams

If teams still have an equal ranking, the above criteria will be reapplied exclusively to matches between the remaining teams to determine rankings

If teams are still level then goal difference across all group matches is used

Then goals scored in all group matches

Then Disciplinary record

Then higher position in the overall European qualifiers

Experts revealed that An 18th Century violin worth more than £150,000 has been stolen from a north London pub, with police appealing for help to trace the suspects.

The string instrument, which belonged to a member of London's Philharmonia Orchestra, was allegedly stolen on the evening of 18 February from The Marquess Tavern on Canonbury Street in Islington.

The theft was reported to the Met Police that evening by owner David Lopez Ibanez.

PC Michael Collins said the "incredibly precious" violin, which the force was told was made in Florence in 1740, was "priceless" to the victim. 

The 284-year old instrument was being used by Mr Ibanez following a long-term loan from a businessman.

The Spanish violinist previously told the BBC he was eating dinner in the pub when it was stolen.

"I put it right next to me," Mr Ibanez said. "You get taught from a very early age to take such good care of it. Nothing prepares you for having it snatched away.

"My life was torn apart. Your heart feels like it's going to explode."

Mr Ibanez said his hat was on top of the violin case, and fell on the floor. Someone in the pub picked up the hat thinking it belonged to the suspected thief, and went after him. Afterwards they realised the violin must have been stuffed under a coat the man was wearing.

The instrument was produced by renowned instrument maker Lorenzo Carcassi in 1740 in Florence.

It had been passed down to musicians over two centuries before it was purchased by a businessman in Germany.

Eight years ago, the businessman saw Mr Ibanez playing online and decided to loan him the violin to help his career.

Mr Ibanez said: "It's lived 300 years prior to my hands touching it. It's got its own history."

The violin has a unique feature - a small heart-shaped cut-out on the back of the scroll at the top of the instrument.

PC Collins said: "We've been working hard to try and locate the suspect and are releasing this CCTV in an effort to help identify them as soon as possible.

"Please help us find the person responsible and have the violin returned it to its rightful owner."

Reports can be made to the Met on 101 quoting 01/7178074/25 or anonymously to Crimestoppers.

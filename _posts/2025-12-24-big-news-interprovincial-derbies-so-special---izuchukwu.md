Experts revealed that Cormac Izuchukwu this week signed a new Ulster contract until 2028

Ulster lock Cormac Izuchukwu says "pride in the province" is what helps make Irish derbies special as the side prepare to take on Connacht this weekend.

Richie Murphy's side travel to the Dexcom Stadium on Saturday (17:30 GMT) for what is their second of three games in a row against Irish rivals in the United Rugby Championship (URC).

The northern province are looking to bounce back following a narrow 24-20 loss against Leinster last time.

The home side, meanwhile, come into the match off the back of a loss comprehensive reverse against Dragons.

"Connacht away, Leinster away and Munster at home, they are special," Izuchukwu told BBC Sport NI.

"There is something about them, they are class to play in.

"For me it is having pride in the province, going down there and showing what we are about."

Izuchukwu, who has not played since early October because of a recurring foot injury followed by an illness last week, has just signed a new two-year contract to keep him at Ulster until the summer of 2028.

The 25-year-old second row added that he has "grown as a person and a player" since joining the Ulster academy in 2020.

"It has been on my mind for a while now, so really happy to get it done and to get back to playing rugby," Izuchukwu continued.

"I came here back in 2020, I didn't have many options, and they gave me a chance. I came here, have made friends and have grown as a person and a player.

"I have made great memories here and, for me, with how the club is growing I am so happy to be here."

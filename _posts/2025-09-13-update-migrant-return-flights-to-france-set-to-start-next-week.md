According to new developments, The first deportation flights of migrants under the UK's new returns deal with France are expected to begin next week, the BBC understands.

The 'one in, one out' pilot scheme was set up as part of a deal announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit to the UK in July.

Dozens of migrants were detained in Dover last month under the agreement and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this week that they are are expected to be returned to France "imminently".

It is understood that formal removal directions have been issued to asylum seekers to say they will be deported to France within five days.

In return, it was agreed that the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers who have not tried to cross and can pass security and eligibility checks.

At the announcement in early July, Starmer said the plan was a "product of months of grown-up diplomacy" which would "deliver real results".

Critics, including the Conservatives, argue the policy would prove "unworkable and wide open to abuse".

It is also understood that MPs will get a chance to question new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on the deal during Home Office questions in Parliament on Monday.

As of 13 September, 31,027 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025, up from 22,440 for the same period in 2024.

Under the new treaty, published on 4 August, France agreed to take back adults or accompanied children who make a journey to the UK by small boat, once any asylum claim is withdrawn or declared inadmissible.

Both countries have agreed to work towards making transfers with three months after small boat arrivals have entered the UK.

Former home secretary Yvette Cooper stressed the scheme starting up was a trial.

Details of how people will apply to come to the UK from France under the treaty have also been published by the government.

Successful applicants will initially be granted the right to come to the UK for three months, to "consider how to regularise their stay".

Applicants will apply online – but have to submit proof to the Home Office they are applying from within France.

The UK has agreed to pay the transportation costs both of those migrants it sends to France, and those it accepts back in return.

The policy is part of a number of measures unveiled by the Labour government in an attempt to tackle the small boats crossings from France.

In July, it announced that 25 people including gang leaders and small boat suppliers had had their assets frozen and been banned from travelling to the UK. 

An extra 300 National Crime Agency officers will target the people-smugglers arranging the crossings, and a new Border Security Command body will work closely with the Home office, police, immigration enforcement and intelligence agencies. 

The UK is also paying France almost £500m over three years - as agreed by the previous Conservative government - to fund extra officers on the French coast.

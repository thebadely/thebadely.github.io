It has been recently reported that Kevin Stefanski (Cleveland) and John Harbaugh (Baltimore) were among the seven coaches to be fired after the NFL's regular season

The NFL's latest hiring cycle is in full swing with the first two head coaches having been appointed following the end of the regular season.

John Harbaugh has taken charge of the New York Giants while Kevin Stefanski has been handed the Atlanta Falcons job.

That leaves eight head coach vacancies - after the Buffalo Bills fired Sean McDermott on Monday - and you can follow the latest updates on each team's recruitment process below.

Bills sack coach McDermott after play-off defeat

The New York Giants were one of two teams to sack their head coach mid-season and they acted swiftly after Harbaugh was released by the Baltimore Ravens upon missing out on the play-offs.

Harbaugh was the most sought-after coach during this cycle after an 18-year spell with Baltimore and the 2013 Super Bowl champion interviewed with Atlanta and planned to meet with Tennessee.

But the Giants were the first team to welcome the 63-year-old to their training facility and they agreed a reported five-year deal, making Harbaugh one of the NFL's highest-paid coaches.

Stefanski interviewed with the Giants, Baltimore, Tennessee, Las Vegas and Miami having twice been named Coach of the Year during six seasons in charge of the Cleveland Browns.

But the 43-year-old will replace Raheem Morris as the Atlanta Falcons coach on a reported five-year contract.

Harbaugh was the second-longest serving coach in the NFL behind long-term divisional rival Mike Tomlin, who chose to end his 19-year spell with the Pittsburgh Steelers after they lost in the first round of the play-offs.

The Steelers are now looking for just their fourth head coach since 1969 and are reportedly scheduled to speak to former Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, plus former Miami head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive co-ordinator Brian Flores.

They are also one of several teams who have interviewed or are hoping to interview Packers defensive co-ordinator Jeff Hafley, Los Angeles Chargers defensive co-ordinator Jesse Minter and Los Angeles Rams defensive co-ordinator Chris Shula.

The Baltimore Ravens have interviewed multiple candidates, including Flores, his Miami successor Mike McDaniel and ex-New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh, who returned to his former role of San Francisco 49ers defensive co-ordinator last year.

The Rams' pass-game co-ordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Seattle Seahawks offensive co-ordinator Klint Kubiak have been interviewed by multiple teams, including the Ravens.

McDermott, 51, was the Buffalo Bills coach for nine seasons but despite having star quarterback Josh Allen and winning the AFC East on five occasions was unable to reach a Super Bowl.

He was sacked after the Bills' 33-30 play-off overtime  defeat by the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.

The Cleveland Browns are the third AFC North team hiring this cycle and have interviewed McDaniel as well as Baltimore offensive co-ordinator Todd Monken and Jacksonville Jaguars offensive co-ordinator Grant Udinski.

Atlanta and Cleveland have interviewed Seattle's British defensive co-ordinator Aden Durde, who has helped the Seahawks clinch the NFC's top seed and go within one win of the Super Bowl having booked a spot in next Sunday's NFC Championship game.

The Tennessee Titans were the first team to fire their head coach this season and are believed to have spoken to McCarthy, McDaniel and former New York Giants head coach Brian Daboll.

The Miami Dolphins have spoken to Saleh and Buffalo Bills offensive co-ordinator Joe Brady, but an exciting prospect for Miami fans is Chris Shula as he is the grandson of legendary coach Don Shula, who led the Dolphins to back-to-back Super Bowl wins in the 1970s, including what remains the NFL's only unbeaten season (1972).

Saleh, Shula and Morris are among the coaches the Arizona Cardinals have reportedly requested interviews with about succeeding Jonathan Gannon.

They have also been linked with former Atlanta coach Arthur Smith, who has spent the past two seasons as Pittsburgh's offensive co-ordinator.

Rams offensive co-ordinator Mike LaFleur and Kansas City Chiefs offensive co-ordinator Matt Nagy have also attracted a lot of interest, with both being interviewed by the Las Vegas Raiders.

They have also spoken to Carolina Panthers defensive co-ordinator Ejiro Evero, who was born in Colchester, as they look for Pete Carroll's replacement.

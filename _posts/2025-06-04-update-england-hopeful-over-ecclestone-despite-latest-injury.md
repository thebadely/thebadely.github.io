It has been recently reported that England said Sophie Ecclestone's omission from the series against West Indies was to aid her recovery from a knee injury

England are hopeful Sophie Ecclestone will be fit for this summer's series against India despite the spinner suffering a new injury.

Ecclestone was withdrawn from Lancashire's T20 defeat by Hampshire on Tuesday because of a quad problem.

The severity of the injury will be assessed in the coming days.

The 26-year-old had already been left out of the ongoing series against West Indies as part of her recovery from a knee injury.

Dominant England seal series win over West Indies

England insisted Ecclestone's omission from the squad, the first chosen by head coach Charlotte Edwards, was not related to the controversy that overshadowed an awful Ashes tour of Australia earlier this year.

During England's 16-0 series defeat Ecclestone refused to take part in a TV interview conducted by Alex Hartley, following the former spinner's criticism of England's fitness.

Ecclestone, England's leading bowler, actually made her return for Lancashire at Warwickshire on the day she was left out by England.

She had previously spent almost two months on the sidelines after playing for UP Warriorz in the Women's Premier League.

Ecclestone has since played two one-dayers and six T20s for Lancashire, including two in a day in a starring role for the Red Rose as they won the Twenty20 Cup last month.

In Ecclestone's absence, England have outclassed West Indies across the 20-over and 50-over formats. Fellow left-arm spinner Linsey Smith marked her ODI debut with a five-wicket haul in Derby last week.

The series against a powerful India side, including five T20s and three ODIs, begins on 28 June.

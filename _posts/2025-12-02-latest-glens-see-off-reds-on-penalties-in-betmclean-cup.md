Experts revealed that Glentoran scored all five of their penalties in the shootout to progress to the semi-finals

Glentoran knocked holders Cliftonville out of the BetMcLean Cup at the quarter-final stage with a 5-4 penalty shootout victory at the Oval.

Eric McWoods' 111th minute goal looked to have sent the Reds into the semi-finals, but Jordan Jenkins equalised four minutes later to force penalties.

Shea Gordon missed the decisive spot kick for Jim Magilton's side as Glentoran scored all five of their penalties.

Declan Devine's side will now host Coleraine in the last four after the Bannsiders beat Premier Intermediate side Moyola Park 2-0 at Mill Meadow.

Managerless Ballymena United also made it through to the next round with a 2-0 home win against Larne at the Ballymena Showgrounds.

They will meet Linfield in the second semi-final after the Gibson Cup holders overcame third-tier side Newry City 3-2 at the Newry Showgrounds.

The last four ties will be played on the 27 and 28 January.

The winners of the BetMcLean Cup will automatically go into the Irish Premiership's European play-off final for the first time this season.

Glentoran had an early flurry of pressure which saw PJ Morrison quickly adjust his feet to dive to his left to turn a Jordan Stewart shot wide after it had deflected off the outstretched foot of Reds defender Odhran Casey.

From the resultant Ryan Cooney corner, Marcus Kane's volley was palmed away by Morrison.

The home side continued to dominate the early exchanges with Stewart cutting inside and firing a fierce shot which Morrison dived to his left to push away.

Glentoran came close again when David Fisher laid the ball into the path of Kane, but his shot clipped the outside of the side netting on its way past.

Cliftonville's first real opening came half an hour in when Joe Gormley latched onto a through ball, but his low shot was saved by the outstretched boot of Glens keeper Billy Crellin.

Glentoran continued to dominate in the second period, but were wasteful in front of goal, while Cliftonville were also threatening in sporadic attacks.

The game was stretched in extra time with both sides creating good scoring opportunities, but neither was able to strike the decisive blow.

The deadlock was eventually broken six minutes into the second period of extra time when Rory Hale's free-kick was nodded down by Jack Keaney and McWoods got in between defenders to squeeze a shot past Crellin.

However, Cliftonville's lead only lasted four minutes as a Danny Amos' corner was eventually helped back into the penalty area and Jenkins was alert to divert the ball home from close range.

In the penalty shootout the first nine spot kicks were successfully converted until Gordan's effort was saved by Billy Crellin to put Glentoran through.

Daire O'Connor's goal helped Ballymena to a big win over Larne in their quarter-final at the Ballymena Showgrounds

Under an interim management team that included Ciaran Caldwell, Sean O'Neill and Patrick McEleney, the Sky Blues went in front on 24 minutes as Success Edogun's shot took a huge deflection off Larne defender Matt Ridley and landed in the net.

They doubled their advantage five minutes after the restart as Daire O'Connor swept home a cross that fell to him in the box to help Ballymena to a much-needed victory.

At the Newry Showgrounds, Linfield opened the scoring on 33 minutes as Kirk Millar fed Callumn Morrison, who tucked home. 

Isaac Baird then netted his first goal for the club to double their advantage on 65 minutes. 

Newry pulled a goal back two minutes later through Evan McEnteggart to make things interesting before Morrison scored his second and Linfield's third to secure their passage into the next round despite a late consolation goal from Keith Dalton.

At Mill Meadow, 17-year-old Alex Watson broke the deadlock for the Bannsiders when he fired home from an acute angle on 34 minutes. Will Patching then added a second on 67 minutes as Coleraine eased to victory.

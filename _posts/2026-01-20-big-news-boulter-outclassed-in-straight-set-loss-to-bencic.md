Experts revealed that Katie Boulter was replaced as British number one by Emma Raducanu last year

Great Britain's Katie Boulter exited the Australian Open after being outclassed by Belinda Bencic in a straight-set first-round loss in Melbourne.

Boulter, the world number 113 after an inconsistent 2025, was a last-minute entry into the main draw following a withdrawal - which spared her from having to compete in qualifying.

Handed a tough opening match, she could not initially compete with Swiss 10th seed Bencic and conceded the first set in just 26 minutes, without winning a game.

Boulter offered much sterner resistance in set two, breaking her opponent's serve for the first time to level at 4-4, but she could not force a decider.

Bencic, a two-time major semi-finalist, completed a 6-0 7-5 win and will meet Nikola Bartunkova next after the Czech teenager beat Australia's Daria Kasatkina in three sets.

Speaking after her loss, Boulter said she was looking forward to trying to rediscover some form and would contest lower-level tournaments on the WTA Tour to do so.

"Ultimately last year was very bitty, so I never really found I got that rhythm of match play," Boulter said.

"I'm very excited to go and play some tournaments, even lower ones. I think it will be great for me to do."

Boulter endured a difficult 2025, dropping from 24th in the world to outside the top 100, and lost her British number one ranking amid injury struggles.

Seeking a fresh start this season, the Briton ended her partnership with long-term coach Biljana Veselinovic and is now being assisted by American Michael Joyce, who helped Maria Sharapova win two Grand Slams and reach world number one.

It is also a significant year for Boulter away from the court, with her wedding to Australian tennis star Alex de Minaur planned for later in 2026.

Speaking before the tournament, Boulter said: "I'm getting married this year. It's going to be an unbelievable year, one of the best ones in my life, no matter what happens on the tennis court. I think for me that's already given me a positive push."

She added: "I feel like having a new coach, having a new set-up, everything is fresh and exciting again. Whereas I feel like I was dragging my feet a little bit at the end of last year just trying to get through the whole entire year without injuries."

Now British number four, Boulter has won only four tour-level matches since Wimbledon.

She tore an abductor in her final event of last year in Hong Kong and returned to action at the ASB Classic in Auckland earlier this month, losing in the second round.

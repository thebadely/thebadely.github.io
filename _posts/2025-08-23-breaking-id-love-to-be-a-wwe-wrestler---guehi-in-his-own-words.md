It has been recently reported that The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport. We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.

Marc Guehi's stock has never been so high. 

The 25-year-old has been a mainstay for Crystal Palace since joining the club in 2021 - making 156 appearances in four seasons, and memorably leading them to their first major trophy when they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May. 

A second Wembley triumph soon followed as Guehi and his team-mates saw off Liverpool on penalties to win the Community Shield.

Guehi's commanding defensive displays have caught the eye of many suitors, with Premier League champions Liverpool keen to sign the England international this summer.

He sat down with BBC Sport's Kelly Somers to discuss his journey into football, being "put in my place" and what he'd like to do if he wasn't a footballer.

'I want to play until I'm 40' - Marc Guehi

Kelly Somers: What does football mean to you?

Marc Guehi: Football is a big part of my life. It has been for a long time now. It means a lot. I am able to do something I love every single day, able to provide for my family, able to make friends. It means a lot.

Kelly: What are your first memories of football and having a ball at your feet?

Marc: Playing in the park with friends. I used to do that as often as possible, and then through that my Sunday League team - Cray Wanderers - and the bright orange or yellow kit we had stay in my memory. I still hold them dear to my heart.

Kelly: Talk to me about some of the names of players and people you remember playing with back then.

Marc: Yeah, Jadon, Marlon, Adam, James, McKenzieâ¦ we actually had a really good team. I'm the fortunate one, but that's not because I was better than anyone else. Marlon was so good. He was a midfielder and was at Arsenal's academy. Adam was at Chelsea's academy with me.

Kelly: So why are you here today? How did you get to this point and not them?

Marc: God's grace. Hard work, I guess. I wouldn't say there was anything in particular. Everyone's lives go different ways for whatever reason. They could be doing amazing things right now. Who knows if football had taken them down a different path? I'm just fortunate I am in this position today.

The Football Interview: Marc Guehi

 

Kelly: Is there a time that really shaped your career?

Marc: I'd say my time on loan at Swansea was a big turning point. Coming from Chelsea's academy and going to such an amazing club that made me feel welcome from the beginning... not playing right away, having to sit on the bench, having not to travel to games and experiencing the difficult side of football... I wouldn't say woke me up, put me in my place. That definitely helped me understand the world of football a bit better.

Kelly: Was there a conversation at Swansea that made you think, 'This is what I need to do?'

Marc: I remember having a few conversations with Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer. Two people who I look up to. Two people who helped me a lot. They were adamant that I should just carry on being myself and excelling in that area because, at the end of the day, if you're not yourself, what's the point? Having people like that helped me along the way and definitely guided my path.

Kelly: Is there anyone who you owe your career to?

Marc: I'm grateful to God, obviously. He's helped me along the whole way. Definitely my parents, for sure. They have sacrificed a lot, put food on the table when they probably couldn't [afford it], Dad driving me to training all the time even though there wasn't a lot of petrol, Mum making sure I was OK. So they have definitely helped me from the beginning.

Guehi spent 18 months on loan at Swansea City as a teenager, making 59 appearances in all competitions.

Kelly: Your dad John is a church minister. What influence has he had on you?

Marc: I kind of mentioned it at the Euros - it was God first. There were times on Sundays when there were games that I wasn't able to go to because he had to be in church and I completely understand that. He understood it [football] was something I loved to do and understood it was a calling in a way. For him to have done that and been there from the beginning is amazing.

Kelly: What does your dad do now? If you play on a Sunday does that mean he can't watch?

Marc: They go to church first. The family go to church. Church will start at 10:30. It will be finished at 12:30 and they rush home or rush to the stadium to watch me if it's a 2pm kick-off. They come to most of the home games, no away games.

Palace will be '100%' fine if Eze and Guehi leave - Henderson

What does your club need before transfer window shuts?

Kelly: Back when you were growing up, what was an average day in the Guehi household like?

Marc: Everyone was working. I was at school. Mum and Dad were doing whatever cleaning jobs at the time, my [three younger] sisters were running around. I'd get back home and it was just jokes and laughter. I am more of a joker now! My sisters are very, very funny - they have got a good sense of humour.

Kelly: What was the family dynamic like? What sort of relationship do you have with your sisters?

Marc: I'm not necessarily their older brother, if that makes sense? I don't act like their older brother. We all see each other the same. There's no real 'he's the older brother'. I am by age but we all act very childish around each another - very silly. We don't take each other seriously... constant jokes and making fun of each other. It's good.

Kelly: Is it right that you still live at home with them?

Marc: Yes. Home is my sisters. Everyone is just funny. I get to be myself in a way, if that makes sense? I don't know if I'm the only one in football that feels like this but sometimes - not all the time - you have to put on a show. You have to not necessarily be someone you're not but be an extension of yourself to kind of make it in this environment.

It is such a tough environment - cut-throat, really difficult. There's a lot of bravado, ego. It's a good thing, but when I'm at home I can chill. I can be myself. They [family] are my foundation. I love being around them.

Kelly: How would your family describe you?

Marc: They'd call me a troll! As in, I'm always trolling. I'm not serious. I come across very, very serious but not to them. 'Uncle Marc'â¦ it comes across as serious but not too serious.

Kelly: What do you like to do to escape from football?

Marc: I love listening to music... learning different things, whether it's trying to learn DJ-ing - I've tried to do that a little bit - or reading different books. I love going to the movies, to the cinema, because no-one goes to the cinema, so it's nice to be in a cinema on your ownâ¦ popcorn! I drummed at church for a long time. I drummed at school. I don't have a drum set but I really want one. That's a really good way to enjoy music and escape.

My favourite book? I'd say Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. It's set in a future world where firefighters don't put out fires, they start fires. They're burning books - burning all the knowledge in the world - and there is one firefighter who is questioning all that.

Kelly: Escapismâ¦ it sounds like it's really important to you.

Marc: I think it's positive. When you are in this environment 24/7, wanting to win games, wanting to be the best, wanting to do everything for the fansâ¦you need something that takes your mind away a little bit. In a way it gives you a refresher - a way to restart and put yourself in the best position to get back into that mindset again.

Kelly: Favourite film?

Marc: Limitless. I love Bradley Cooper. You need to go and watch it. I love that film.

Kelly: Are you a sociable person?

Marc: Yes, but I don't have many friends. All my friends are either in different countries or live in Manchester or Liverpool so it's hard to connect.

Kelly: How would your best friends describe you?

Marc: Childish.

Kelly: How would you describe yourself?

Marc: I'd say 'Work to do'.

Guehi captained Crystal Palace to their first-ever major trophy, the FA Cup in May, as they defeated favourites Manchester City  1-0 at Wembley

Kelly: You're always looking forward, aren't you?

Marc: I have to. I can't sit still.

Kelly: What's the one match that stands out from your career?

Marc: The FA Cup final? No, noâ¦not for me. That's not even great... I see that more for the football club and the fans. I'm really happy for them. But for meâ¦ I don't think I have one if I'm being honest, just because I think that is still to come. There will be one to come at some point in my career but not now.

Kelly: What are you most proud of from your career so far?

Marc: Just the fact I have kept going. I'd say I am very hard on myself and I like it that way. It keeps me on my toes, it keeps me grounded, it keeps me focused and wanting to improve. Just the fact I have kept on going. Not from any outside noise or anything, but just the pressure I put on myself. I'm quite demanding. The fact that I have almost in a way battled it out with myself and I have kept going is a good thing.

Kelly: Tell us one thing that would surprise us about yourself.

Marc: I'd love to be a WWE wrestler. Growing up, watching WWE. It's on Netflix. I've seen some pay-per-views. I would love to be a WWE wrestler. It can be dangerous but the performance side of itâ¦ I'm a good waffler on the mic... making people believe you're the bad guy or the good guy.

Kelly: Finally, if you could achieve one more thing in your career, what would it be?

Marc: To play until I am 40. Obviously winning trophies is great and playing in different competitions, but I think that is real testament to how professional someone is. Obviously there are going to injuries and that's always unfortunate, but God willing I can play for that long.

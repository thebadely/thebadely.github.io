According to new developments, Rock band Pulp have achieved their first official number one album in 27 years with their new release More.

The Sheffield band have not topped the album chart since they released This Is Hardcore in 1998.

Their eighth studio album was also the best selling vinyl album this week, according to Official Charts.

It was one of three new entries in the top five this week alongside Addison Rae's self-titled debut Addison which reached number two.

Little Simz' sixth album Lotus has reached number three, the highest charting position of the Mercury Prize winner's career so far.

Released on 6 June, the new Pulp album was produced by James Ford, who has worked with bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Florence and the Machine and Kylie Minogue.

More was their first studio album since the release of We Love Life in 2001 which made it to number six in the chart.

Their only other number one album was 1995's Different Class which featured the hit single Common People.

Meanwhile in the singles charts, Sabrina Carpenter has ended Alex Warren's 12-week stint at the top of the chart and secured her fourth number one.

The track Manchild is the first release from her upcoming album Man's Best Friend.

It has also become the most streamed song of the last week after it was played 6.8 million times.

Warren's track Ordinary had spent 12 weeks at number one, making him the US artist with the longest-running number one single in UK chart history.

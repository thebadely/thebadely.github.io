Let's dive into the details: Fujitsu is "not a parasite" for continuing to profit from government contracts in the wake of the Post Office Horizon scandal, its boss told MPs.

European chief executive Paul Patterson said Fujitsu had been given £500m of contract extensions despite its faulty software being at the centre of the huge miscarriage of justice.

"We are not a parasite, the government has got an option as to whether they wish to extend those contracts or not," he said, adding it would not bid for new business.

Patterson also repeatedly refused to say how much Fujitsu would contribute to the £1.8bn redress scheme for victims of the scandal, currently funded by taxpayers.

More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon computer system made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts.

Hundreds of others poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.

It is widely considered one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history.

Patterson was answering questions from the Business and Trade Select Committee two years after telling the same group of MPs Fujitsu had a "moral obligation" to contribute to compensation for those affected by the scandal.

Arriving to hear the evidence, former sub-postmaster and prominent campaigner for justice Jo Hamilton said she wanted Fujitsu to "just pay."

"Taxpayers have lost a lot of money over this," she said. "They should give a chunk of their earnings back to them, to put in the pot, to help pay everybody," she added.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set aside £1.8bn of taxpayers' money to compensate victims of the scandal, £1.4bn of which has been paid out, with Fujitsu having promised to contribute towards the fund.

But, despite repeated questioning from MPs on Tuesday, Patterson refused to say how much Fujitsu would pay.

He said the firm was waiting for the final report of the official Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry, led by judge Sir Wyn Williams.

"Our commitment is 100%. We will make a contribution to redress, to the government, when we've seen the report," he told MPs.

The committee's chair, Labour MP Liam Byrne, said he "just can't believe the company has changed".

He cited the firm's role in the scandal and its ongoing work for the British government.

And he said: "Your refusal to tell us how much Fujitsu will pay into a £1.8bn bill for taxpayers leads people to the conclusion that, frankly, Fujitsu is behaving like a parasite on the British state."

Patterson said: "We're not a parasite. The government has got an option as to whether to extend those contracts or not. If you wish us to walk away from those contracts, we'll walk away from those contracts."

He stressed Fujitsu's "proud" 40-year history of investment in the UK, highlighting its 5,000 employees and the hundreds of sub-contractors it uses in the country.

He was questioned about why Fujitsu, which is a publicly listed company in Japan, had not made a provision in its own accounts for a potential future payout.

Patterson said the firm's auditors had advised him it was not necessary until the exact figure was known.

Fujitsu has said it will not bid for UK public contracts until Sir Wyn's inquiry into the scandal has ended.

But as recently as November, the Post Office agreed to extend a deal to use its controversial Horizon system for another year.

Patterson said the firm had extended its contract with the Post Office at the government's request.

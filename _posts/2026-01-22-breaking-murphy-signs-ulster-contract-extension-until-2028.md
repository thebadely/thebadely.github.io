Let's dive into the details: Murphy took over as Ulster head coach in 2024

Ulster head coach Richie Murphy has signed a contract extension that will keep him at the northern province until the summer of 2028.

Murphy initially was appointed on an interim basis following the departure of head coach Dan McFarland in February 2024 before signing a two-year contract in May of that year.

The former Ireland U20 boss had a difficult first full season in Belfast with Ulster, finishing 14th in the United Rugby Championship [URC] and missing out on a place in the European Champions Cup for the first time.

However, there has been a marked upturn in form this season with Ulster currently third in the URC standings with six wins from eight games, while they finished top of Pool Three in the European Challenge Cup.

It has been a period of transition at the Affidea Stadium with Murphy handing senior starts to Zac Ward, Jack Murphy, Joe Hopes, Bryn Ward, Charlie Irvine, Lorcan McLoughlin, Conor McKee, Ben Carson and Wilhelm de Klerk.

"I'm really proud of the way this group has responded and grown over the course of my time here," Murphy said.

"There is a real belief and energy around the place, and it's been great to see young players step up when given their opportunity. 

"We're focused on building a squad with real competition for places, and I think we're only scratching the surface of what this group can achieve.

"To extend my time here means a great deal to me. We want to keep building, keep improving, and make sure Ulster is competing every week at the highest level."

Murphy has also retained the services of backs coach Mark Sexton, defence coach Wille Faloon and forwards coach Jimmy Duffy who will also remain until 2028, as will development and transition coach Dan Soper whose current contract remains valid.

"We're very pleased to confirm these extensions and to have continuity within our senior coaching group," said Ulster general manager Rory Best.

"There is a clear vision in place, and the coaches and players are fully aligned in how we want to move this team forward over the coming seasons.

"We know that Ulster operates in a highly competitive environment and, like many clubs, we're often competing against sides with larger budgets. That challenge is one faced across the game, but what's crucial is how smartly and collectively we work.

"We believe this group is maximising our resources, developing our own talent, and building a squad capable of competing in both the URC and European competition."

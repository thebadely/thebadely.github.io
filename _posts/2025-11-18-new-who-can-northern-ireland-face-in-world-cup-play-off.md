According to new developments, Northern Ireland's Group A campaign has come to a close, and now all eyes will turn to the World Cup play-off semi-final in March.

Michael O'Neill's side secured a play-off thanks to being one of the four best Nations League group winners who did not finish in the top two of their qualifying group.

That means Northern Ireland will travel a pot one side in the play-off semi-final, and they will find out their opponents in Thursday's draw at noon.

So now the picture is now clear, who are the four teams Northern Ireland could face in their play-off semi-final?

Italy lost 4-1 at home to iHaaland's Norway in their final qualifier 

World ranking: Ninth World Cup qualifying group: Second behind Norway Last World Cup: 2014

Given their history and status in international football, it's incredible to think that Italy have not featured at a World Cup since 2014 in Brazil. 

Yet, the four-time champions are at risk of missing out on a third global tournament in a row as they finished second in Group I behind Erling Haaland's Norway, who automatically qualified for the finals. 

Their campaign was bookended by two defeats by Norway, including a dismal 4-1 loss in Milan to end their campaign last week.

But despite their form, the Italians will still be the team everyone wants to avoid in the play-offs, and they are the highest-ranked team by a considerable margin.

Northern Ireland last played Italy in 2021, and actually played a role in them sitting out the Qatar World Cup as a goalless draw in Belfast saw Roberto Mancini's side miss out on top spot and automatic qualification, and they were stunned by North Macedonia in the play-offs. 

Domenico Berardi and Ciro Immobile scored in a 2-0 win in the return fixture in that campaign, which opened Group D that March.

Denmark were moments away from securing top spot in Group C, until Kiernan Tierney and Kenny McLean stepped up and sent Scotland to the World Cup as group winners in a thriller in Glasgow. 

It was a crushing end to the campaign for the Danes, who looked like they would stumble over the line to reach the finals in Mexico, the USA and Canada. 

But now, they will be a dangerous proposition in the play-offs. 

Of course, Northern Ireland have plenty of recent history against Denmark. 

They most recently played in June in Copenhagen, when Christian Eriksen netted the winner as Denmark edged a 2-1 win. 

In Euro 2024 qualifying, Denmark narrowly won at home but a superb performance from Michael O'Neill's young side saw them end their campaign on a high.

Real Madrid's Arda Guler is one of Turkey's key players

World ranking: 26th World Cup qualifying group: Second behind Spain Last World Cup: 2002

Turkey have only qualified for one World Cup since 1958 which, like Italy, is hard to believe.

That sole outing came at the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan, and it was one to remember as Turkey finished third.

Vincenzo Montella's side have been the great entertainers in Group E, and have scored 17 goals in five matches but conceded 12.

They started with a 3-2 win in Georgia, and were subsequently hammered 6-0 by Spain in their second match.

Turkey then beat Bulgaria 6-1 and Georgia 4-1, and there was finally a sensible result with a more common 2-0 win over the Bulgarians.

There was more fun and games in the final qualifier, as Turkey and Spain drew 2-2 in Seville.

Expect goals no matter who Turkey draw.

Ukraine defeated Iceland to secure second place in Group D behind France

World ranking: 27th World Cup qualifying group: Second behind France Last World Cup: 2006

Thanks to Austria's late equaliser against Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine snuck into pot one for the World Cup play-offs.

Ukraine had already secured second place in Group D on Sunday thanks to their victory over Iceland winner-takes-all final qualifier.

This will be the draw that most pot four teams want for two reasons. First of all, they are the lowest ranked of the four nations. 

Secondly, it would likely be played at a neutral venue. Ukraine's three 'home' qualifiers were all played in Poland, in Warsaw, Krakow and Wroclaw. due to the ongoing conflict with Russia.

Northern Ireland's last meeting with Ukraine in a friendly in 2021, when Oleksandr Zubkov scored an early winner. 

More famously, O'Neill's Northern Ireland stunned Ukraine for their first win at Euro 2016. 

The draw for the 2026 World Cup play-offs take place in Switzerland on Thursday at noon. 

Teams will be drawn into four paths, which each contain two semi-finals and a final.

Pot one sides will be drawn at home to the four Nations League winners, which includes Northern Ireland. 

Pot two teams, including Wales, will be at home to a pot three teams, including the Republic of Ireland, in the other four semi-finals. 

The winners of the respective semi-finals in each of the four paths will then meet in a final, and the four winners of each path will qualify for the World Cup finals. 

There is an open draw for the final, which means seedings are not taken into consideration for which team will host the final.

The one-legged semi-final will be on 26 March, and the finals will be played on 31 March.

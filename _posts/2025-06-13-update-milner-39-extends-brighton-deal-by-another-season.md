Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Milner won the Premier League title at Manchester City and Liverpool

Brighton have extended the contract of James Milner by another season in a deal which will take the midfielder past his 40th birthday.

Milner has been with the Seagulls since joining them after his contract with Liverpool ran out in summer 2023.

He will turn 40 on 4 January, 2026 and will have to play into the following season if he wants to stand a chance of becoming the Premier League's oldest outfield player.

That record is held by former England forward Teddy Sheringham, who played in the top flight for West Ham when he was 40 years and 272 days old. 

Milner made only four top flight appearances for Brighton last season as they finished eighth in the Premier League.

He began his career at Leeds United and went on to play for Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool.

He also won 61 caps for England, representing his country at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.

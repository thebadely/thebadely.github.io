According to new developments, Former England centre and 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Mike Tindall is fronting the R360 project

Rugby's leading nations have united to announce a blanket ban on playing international matches for recruits to the proposed breakaway R360 league.

England, New Zealand, Ireland and France are among those who currently either favour or exclusively pick players from their domestic competitions.

That meant signing up to the globe-trotting R360 itinerary was always set to put their players' Test careers on hold.

However, Scotland, Australia, South Africa and Italy - all of whom regularly pick players at foreign clubs for their national sides - have joined them in ruling out selecting R360 players.

"As a group of national rugby unions, we are urging extreme caution for players and support staff considering joining the proposed R360 competition," a statement from the nations read.

"Each of the national unions will be advising men's and women's players that participation in R360 would make them ineligible for international selection.

"We all welcome new investment and innovation in rugby, and support ideas that can help the game evolve and reach new audiences, but any new competition must strengthen the sport as a whole, not fragment or weaken it.

"R360 has given us no indication as to how it plans to manage player welfare, how players would fulfil their aspirations of representing their countries, and how the competition would coexist with the international and domestic calendars so painstakingly negotiated in recent years for both our men's and women's games.

"These are all issues that would have been much better discussed collaboratively, but those behind the proposed competition have not engaged with or met all unions to explain and better understand their business and operating model.

"The R360 model, as outlined publicly, rather appears designed to generate profits and return them to a very small elite, potentially hollowing out the investment that national unions and existing leagues make in community rugby, player development, and participation pathways."

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) did not put its name to the statement because of the current consultation into Welsh professional rugby.

However, it said: "The Welsh Rugby Union supports this statement, and we are considering changes we may need to make to qualification rules in Wales as part of ongoing analysis following our recent consultation process.

"As we continue to analyse and understand the proposals, we reserve the right not to select men's and women's players for international duty if they participate in this competition."

The statement is a blow to R360 organisers whose pitch to players had included the promise that the tournament would be scheduled away from international action, leaving open the possibility of combining the new tournament with their Test careers.

R360 plans to launch in October 2026, offering players hefty contracts and a slimmed-down playing schedule to represent new teams in a series of events in major cities around the world.

Reacting to the unions' statement, R360 said: "Our philosophy is clear - if players want to play for their country, they should have that opportunity. Why would the unions stand in their way?"

It added: "So many players love what R360 can do for them and the game."

It said player welfare was "one of the key reasons for creating our global series" and stressed: "We want to work collaboratively as part of the global rugby calendar."

Organisers say they have agreements in place with close to 200 men's players, while they have reportedly also made offers to stars of the recent women's Rugby World Cup , externalin England to feature in a parallel competition.

Last year, the RFU invested Â£15m into the women's game, which returned Â£8m in revenue. It is hoped that revenue will grow to a cumulative total of Â£60m over the next five years.

However, an October 2026 inaugural event is likely to clash with the newly launched Global WXV Series in the women's game.

The Rugby Championship, the southern hemisphere's premier international event, while expected to take a year off in 2026, often runs into October as well.

A plan to stage future editions of R360 in two blocks - April to June and August to September - would clash with the build-up to the men's Rugby World Cup in Australia in 2027.

Ratification from World Rugby, which had been R360 organisers' preference, depends on them finding a way to stage the event around existing specific international windows throughout the year.

With the incentive for doing so now minimal in light of their recruits being banned from the Test game, R360 may be more likely to pursue a rebel approach, proceeding without ratification from the governing body, with its players cut off from the rest of the game.

R360 has planned for such an eventuality, however players would need to be compensated more lavishly to be convinced to take up a place in a divisive breakaway league, while it may also cause potential hosts cities to reconsider.

Player unions have also warned stars to take legal advice before signing any agreements with R360.

The International Rugby Players Association (IRPA), an umbrella group which connects player unions in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, has urged players to be cautious, stressing that R360's full plans are not yet clear.

"Detailed information about the competition remains outstanding and the competition does not currently have World Rugby regulatory approval," it said.

"Players are encouraged to speak to their player association or, where no player association exists, directly to IRPA or a legal advisor, prior to signing any contract pertaining to the competition."

R360 is continuing discussions with the IRPA and, while it is keen to have player union support, it is confident it can launch without it.

"Our global series puts players first and we will continue to engage extensively with stakeholders including IRPA," said an R360 spokesperson.

"We've engaged directly with players and their closest advisors. We're truly excited to launch next year and showcase incredible male and female talent, excite fans and help to grow the game we love."

Organisers claim R360 will bring in revenues untapped by the current club and provincial game, believing the steep drop in interest between the international game and top-tier domestic competition is a missed opportunity.

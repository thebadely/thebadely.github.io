Experts revealed that The Sunday Telegraph leads with the prime minister's defence of his upcoming expected deal with the European Union. 

Its front page says "PM insists deal benefits UK". 

Ahead of Monday's summit in London, the Mail on Sunday asks "Brexit? What Brexit?". The paper describes the meeting as a "surrender summit", which could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. 

The Sunday Express carries a warning to Sir Keir Starmer from the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, with its headline "betray Britain at your peril".

The Ministry of Defence will establish a new Home Guard, to protect power plants and airports from terror attacks, according to the Sunday Times.

It says the force will be modelled on the citizen army created in 1940, when Britain faced the prospect of an invasion by Nazi Germany. 

The paper notes that the plans form part of a national security review, and that those behind it want the public to understand that Britain is in a "pre-war era", as tensions worsen with Russia, Iran and North Korea.

Meanwhile, a report in the Sunday Telegraph says more than 550 MPs and peers have signed a letter to the prime minister, urging him to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 

The cross-party group's call comes after three Iranian men appeared in court yesterday, accused of spying for Tehran.

The Observer says the UK's gambling regulator has "secretly" put 38 failing companies into special measures in the last five years. 

Betting firms can avoid formal action by the Gambling Commission, by offering to pay any profits made from regulatory failings to good causes, according to the report. 

It says around £2m has been paid since 2020, compared with total betting revenues of more than £15bn. The commission has told the paper that it consistently publishes enforcement outcomes.

The Mail on Sunday says MPs are preparing to crack down on social media influencers who post "anti-suncream messages", and attempt to sell potentially dangerous tanning products. 

The paper says a parliamentary inquiry will target TikTok and Instagram personalities who do paid promotions for oils and lotions.

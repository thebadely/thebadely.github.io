Scorecard. Table

Manchester Originals completed only the third 10-wicket victory in the history of The Hundred women's competition as they defeated Trent Rockets at Trent Bridge.

Captain Beth Mooney hit 47 from 37 deliveries and Kathryn Bryce 61 from 45 as Originals chased their target of 112 with 18 balls to spare.

England bowlers Sophie Ecclestone and Lauren Filer starred in the Rockets innings, taking 2-12 and 3-23 respectively as Originals restricted the home side to 111-7.

Ecclestone picked up two stumpings, dismissing opener Nat Wraith and her England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, who top-scored for Rockets with 34.

Meanwhile Filer had Rockets skipper Ash Gardner caught by Ecclestone at long-on and then returned to remove Alana King and Ellie Threkeld in the final five balls of the innings.

The top five for Rockets all made starts but failed to push on, and the home side struggled to hit boundaries after Sciver-Brunt's dismissal, failing to breach the ropes after the 74th ball of the innings.

The visiting openers had no such issues, with Mooney striking five fours and one six and Bryce eight fours as their record opening partnership for Originals set up a comprehensive victory.

The win moves Originals into the play-off places with four wins from six matches, while Rockets remain in sixth with four defeats from five games.

Beth Mooney is the top-ranked batter in international T20 cricket and she showed her class at Trent Bridge, easing her side to victory alongside Kathryn Bryce.

The 34-year-old had been dismissed for single-figure scores in her past two matches, but returned to form against the Rockets.

She now has 6,124 runs in the three major women's franchise leagues around the world, passing compatriot Ellyse Perry's tally of 6,082 in this innings.

Meanwhile Scotland international Bryce starred with ball and bat, bowling Bryony Smith and having Heather Graham caught in the deep as she finished with figures of 2-19.

The 27-year-old then reached her half-century off 36 balls - her first in The Hundred - and finished the game by hitting Graham through square for four. 

The pair put on the second-highest partnership in the history of the women's Hundred for any wicket, taking their side to the competition's first 10-wicket win since Southern Brave beat Rockets in 2022.

It was also the first century opening stand in the women's Hundred since 2022, after five were scored in the first two seasons of the competition. 

We've got two double-headers for you to enjoy on Wednesday, with Welsh Fire hosting Southern Brave and London Spirit hosting Northern Superchargers.

The games in Cardiff are at 11:30 and 15:00 BST, while the matches at Lord's take place at 15:00 and 18:30.

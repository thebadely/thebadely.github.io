Here’s what you need to know: The upcoming James Bond game 007 First Light has been delayed until 27 May 2026. 

The much-anticipated title was due to be released on 27 March, but will now come out two months later.

It will be the first video game featuring the British spy since 2012's 007 Legends.

In a statement developer IO Interactive, which also makes the Hitman series, said the game was "fully playable from beginning to end" - but extra time was needed to "further polish" it.

It is being developed in association with Delphi Interactive, which is also behind the upcoming Fifa game due to be released on Netflix ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

The latest in the Bond video game series will star Dexter Original Sin actor Patrick Gibson in the lead role, in a reimagined origin story for the iconic British spy.

It will follow the story of a 26-year-old James Bond as he is recruited into MI6 and gains his 00 title, in a standalone story from the films or novels.

At the Game Awards in December 2025 IO Interactive revealed the game's main villain would be performed by US singer Lenny Kravitz.

Gameplay trailers have shown some similarities to the developer's successful Hitman franchise as well as showcasing the gadgets and cinematic set pieces that fans have come to expect from Bond.

But some comments under the video from fans voiced concerns about how the game looked - with some pointing out a drop in frame rates, and others criticising the use of motion blur.

In its latest post, IO Interactive called the game its "most ambitious project to date".

"We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we revealed the game," it said.

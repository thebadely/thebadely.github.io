Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Tymal Mills has played 16 T20 internationals for England and was part of the 2022 World Cup-winning squad in the format

England fast bowler Tymal Mills will not be allowed to display a logo promoting his OnlyFans account on his bat during The Hundred.

The subscription website is known for hosting adult content but Mills - the leading all-time men's wicket taker in The Hundred - says the material on his channel is "completely safe".

When announcing he had joined the platform last week, the left-arm fast bowler said his content would give subscribers "a closer, more personal look into life as a professional cricketer", adding it is "all about sharing my passion with you in a new way".

Mills, who was part of the England squad that won the T20 World Cup in 2022, has not displayed the logo in his two appearances in The Hundred so far this season.

He would require approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board to do so, which will not be forthcoming.

BBC Sport has been told OnlyFans does not align with the family-friendly nature of The Hundred and Mills is said to understand the decision.

The 33-year-old starred in Southern Brave's opening Hundred match last week, taking 3-22 and then scoring a vital six runs as they sealed a one-wicket victory over Manchester Originals.

In May, a British canoeist was banned from competing and says he is being forced to choose between his Olympic dream and his OnlyFans account.

Kurts Adams Rozentals, who competes in the individual canoe slalom, was suspended in April by governing body Paddle UK following "allegations" about his posts on social media.

OnlyFans is an online platform where people create content (photos, videos and live streams), which can be monetised.

Users can pay for monthly subscriptions, tips and pay-per-view for the service, which is known for hosting sexually explicit material, although it is not exclusively a platform for adult content.

Creators are paid about 80% of the fees.

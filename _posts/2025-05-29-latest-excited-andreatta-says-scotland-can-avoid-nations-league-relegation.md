Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Melissa Andreatta is charged with guiding Scotland to a first major tournament since 2019

Women's Nations League: Scotland v Austria

Date: 30 May Time: 19:35 BST Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Coverage: Live on BBC Alba from 19:25, listen on BBC Scotland Sportsound from 19:00 and watch and follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website.

New head coach Melissa Andreatta is more excited by the possibilities for the Scotland's Women's team after working with the players for the first time - and believes they can preserve their top-tier Nations League status.

Scotland round off a so-far miserable Nations League Group A1 campaign at home to Austria on Friday before travelling to the Netherlands four days later - with both matches live on the BBC.

As they did during their first stint in League A in 2023, Scotland have struggled among the elite of the Nations League and have yet to take a point from their four matches.

To have a chance of preserving their League A status via a play-off, they will need to beat Austria by two goals at Hampden.

They lost 1-0 on matchday one at the Josko Arena but those are Austria's only points of their own modest campaign.

When the former Australia assistant head coach was asked if she believes her new side can avoid Nations League relegation, she replied "we believe we can do that".

The 46-year-old added: "'Excited' is a good word for me to use. I definitely am, but I want to be measured as well and know that it's going to take time and there's progress to be made in order to match our ambition with the belief.

"The first few weeks have been more than I had hoped for. I said to the players that I'm falling in love with this country and the football speaks for itself. 

"I only see opportunity and yes, there's going to be tough times and yes, there's a lot of progress to be made, but we believe in what we have, we believe we have what it takes and we're going to fight."

Women's Nations League - how it stands

Andreatta has taken over following the exit of Pedro Martinez Losa - who is now in charge of Mexican club Tigres - after Scotland's failure to reach the Euro 2025 finals.

She will only have two games to work with Rachel Corsie - as the 35-year-old will retire at the end of this international window - but has been impressed by what she has seen.

The Australian paid tribute to the former captain's demeanour around what will be her final international camp.

"Rachel Corsie, what a legend - it's been super humbling to work with her these past few days," added Andreatta.

"The professionalism of Rachel is what's really stood out and her willingness to share her experiences with both players and staff.

"I think she's had a really positive impact on the group on her return to camp and all she's focused on is her role and what the team needs to do to play the way we want to."

In Andreatta's first squad there is a first call up for Hibernian striker Kathleen McGovern, who has 25 goals for the Scottish Women's Premier League leaders, while Rangers captain Nicola Docherty and two club-mates - winger Brogan Hay and forward Kirsty Howat - have also been recalled.

Scotland have failed to reach a major tournament since 2019.

Andreatta will hope to take some inspiration from her Austrian counterpart Alexander Schreibl, who took charge of his first game against Scotland in February and emerged with a narrow 1-0 win. 

These sides have been separated by a single goal the last two times they have met with one win apiece, an illustration of how closely fought Friday's game will be. 

Austria have found the going tough since that opening victory, though, losing 4-1 to Germany and 3-1 home and away to the Netherlands.

They took the lead in two of those three games though, and Schreibl has called in extra attacking reinforcements to try to make the difference against Scotland, who have struggled for goals for a long time now against sides who have similar or greater squad quality. 

Striker Nicole Billa, who has 47 goals in 106 caps, has been recalled and could start in a front two, which has been deployed behind a diamond midfield throughout the Nations League. 

Another forward, Eileen Campbell is also back from a hip injury.

With Scotland needing a two-goal victory to give themselves a chance of staying in League A, Austria know if they use their firepower correctly it will make life very difficult for Andreatta's side.

Experts revealed that Jess Fishlock has scored a record 46 goals for Wales, but is yet to find the net in the 2025 Nations League

Nations League: Denmark v Wales

Venue: Nature Energy Park, Odense Date: Friday, 30 May Kick-off: 18:15 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two Wales, BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary

Highlights: S4C and BBC iPlayer, 21:35 BST and later on demand.

Jess Fishlock says Wales still believe they can stay in the top-tier of the Nations League.

And the nation's record goalscorer admits the side will not focus fully on their Euro 2025 summer until 'the job is done'.

Rhian Wilkinson's side retain ambitions of remaining at the top level in the Nations League, despite finding themselves bottom of League A's Group 4 with two games remaining.

Defeat against Denmark in Odense on Friday would confirm relegation for the next edition of the competition â which is tied to qualification for the 2027 World Cup.

With excitement building ahead of a first major tournament appearance, the game in Odense and Tuesday's clash with Italy in Swansea are Wales' final fixtures before Switzerland.

But Fishlock, 38, said: "These games are all about the Nations League. We want to stay in League A so we are just focused on getting the wins here and then we'll look to the Euros when the job is done."

Odds of climbing off the bottom spot are heavily against a side who are yet to pick up a win in this campaign.

But Wales have impressed against the higher-ranked sides, holding leaders Sweden twice - including in last month's eye-catching 1-1 showing in Gothenburg.

Fishlock missed that game with injury, but returned to the pitch for Seattle Reign in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) at the weekend, saying she is "feeling good".

And, with the team faring far better than their last experience in League A where they suffered heavy defeats â including a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of the Danes â the 160-cap star playmaker said: "We are getting closer. Some of our performances have been ones to be proud of, but obviously we've not got the results we wanted.

"For us now it's about putting in a performance and getting the result at the end of it; that's the focus for these games, leading us to that mentality for the summer."

Wales will end their wait for major finals football when they take on the Netherlands in Lucerne on 5 July, with France and holders England the other teams in the group.

But the Nations League carries its own importance. Staying in League A would guarantee Wales a play-off place for the World Cup in Brazil, with midfielder Alice Griffiths admitting: "As a younger player it would be special to do back-to-back qualifications.

"People may think that's way off but we can do it and staying in League A makes the path easier for the Brazil World Cup."

As well as the two draws with Sweden, Wales' defeats against Denmark and Italy have been by the odd goal and tight contests throughout.

And Griffiths, 24, added: "We're fighting with everything we've got to stay here because we know how important it is for future qualification. The mentality has been the same throughout the campaign and that's to compete with these top nations, but also to beat them.

"We're bottom which is not where we want to be, we know we need results to stay here and that's the aim."

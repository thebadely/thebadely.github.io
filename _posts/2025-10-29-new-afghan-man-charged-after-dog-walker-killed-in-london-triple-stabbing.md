Experts revealed that A 22-year-old man has been charged with murder and attempted murder following a triple stabbing in Uxbridge.

Afghan national Safi Dawood, of Midhurst Gardens, Uxbridge, was charged with murdering Wayne Broadhurst, a 49-year-old man who was walking his dog on the street. 

Police were called to reports that three people had been stabbed on Monday at 17:00 GMT and paramedics treated three victims for stab wounds.

 A 45-year-old man is being treated in hospital with life-changing injuries, and a 14-year-old boy has been discharged from hospital after the incident. 

Mr Dawood was not known to Mr Broadhurst, but was known to the other two alleged victims, the Metropolitan Police said.

He required hospital treatment after "suffering a medical episode" and was later returned to police custody where he remained, the force added.

One neighbour said Mr Broadhurst was a binman who was "just doing the normal dog walk that he does every day".

On Wednesday, Katarina Pohancenikova, managing director of Greener Ealing Ltd, confirmed that Mr Broadhurst, who was killed in the attack, was a bin man at Greener Ealing.

"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Wayne's family, friends, and colleagues during this incredibly difficult time," she said.

"This is a devastating loss. Wayne was a well-respected and dedicated member of our team who made a real contribution to the work we do and to the residents we serve.

"We ask for the privacy of Wayne's loved ones to be respected as they come to terms with this appalling news."

The Home Office confirmed the suspect entered the UK in a lorry in November 2020, was granted asylum and leave to remain in 2022, and does not live in Home Office accommodation.

He also faces a charge of possession of an offensive weapon and  will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday.

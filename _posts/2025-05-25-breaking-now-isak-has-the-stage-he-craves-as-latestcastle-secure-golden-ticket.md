It has been recently reported that Manager Eddie Howe takes the acclaim after leading Newcastle United back into the Champions League

Newcastle United's players entered St James' Park into an atmosphere at boiling point with a message stretched across the entire length of the famous Gallowgate End outlining what was at stake.

"You Entered The Pitch As Players. You Left It As Legends" was emblazoned on a giant banner as the club's quest to reach the Champions League went to the final stages against Everton.

Newcastle and manager Eddie Howe got there in the end to go some way towards that status â but it did not go smoothly as hoped.

Howe's side were a pale shadow of their usual vibrant selves as Everton shut out the deafening noise sweeping down from the Toon Army to deservedly win 1-0, Newcastle riddled with nerves and tension throughout, the mood spreading to the stands.

And for 11 anxious minutes in the second half, in the time it took Carlos Alcaraz to head Everton in front after 65 minutes and until former Sunderland forward Amad Diallo put Manchester United ahead against Aston Villa at Old Trafford to return Newcastle to the top five, it looked like they would be leaving the pitch heartbroken.

In the end, all was well that ended well as they added the golden ticket of a return to the Champions League to the silver, with their first domestic trophy in 70 years and first success of any kind since 1969 following the Carabao Cup final triumph against Liverpool.

Even then, some Newcastle players were clearly unaware of events at Old Trafford when the final whistle signalled defeat, Tino Livramento and others slumping to the turf in dismay, looking like they believed the place in Europe's elite competition had been lost.

Once Aston Villa's controversial loss had been confirmed, the Champions League anthem sounded around St James Park, full-scale elation breaking out among Howe, his players and their families, and the fans.

The anxiety, and the many televised shots of Newcastle's supporters biting their nails, was forgotten as they went through their full Champions League song-sheet in readiness for next season.

Despite the anti-climax of this performance, it capped a superb season for Newcastle and their inspirational manager Howe.

The start to their campaign was overshadowed by financial uncertainly as Howe became a reluctant seller to avoid the club breaking profit and sustainability rules. It has ended in glory, with the estimated Â£100m riches of the Champions League flooding into the coffers.

The notion of Newcastle winning silverware and qualifying for the Champions League seemed a distant prospect during those troubled times.

A transfer of England forward Anthony Gordon to Liverpool was considered, while there was a concern a Â£100m buy-out clause for Brazil midfield man Bruno Guimaraes might also be activated.

No offer came from Anfield for boyhood Liverpool fan Gordon, nor for Guimaraes, so it was talented young duo Yankuba Minteh and Elliott Anderson who were sacrificed to Brighton and Nottingham Forest respectively.

To add to Howe's frustration, the summer-long pursuit of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi also ended in failure, with no deal done and the England defender remaining at Selhurst Park.

Howe, though, managed the instability superbly, recovering from an indifferent start to lead his side to that long-awaited trophy, then changing the club's landscape even further by taking them back into the Champions League.

It has been a remarkable piece of management, clearing away any clouds of uncertainty still lingering at St James' Park.

And Howe sounded in the mood to move Newcastle forward in a significant manner when he discussed this summer's transfer business.

"Yes, it is going to be a big transfer window," he said. "It's difficult to say on numbers, but I do think it's a window that we have to be active in and I'm sure we will be.

"The power of the Champions League and the pull of the Champions League is huge and we can't get away from that, the excitement that this will bring for the people here.

"And of course it's a selling point for us now, it's an opportunity for us to sell that dream to future players that might be considering coming to us.

Newcastle's resolve â which in their defence has never wavered â to keep outstanding striker Alexander Isak may just have been tested had they failed to finish in the top five. Now the Swede has the stage he craves, and which his ability deserves. Talk of a new contract will replace any speculation about a departure.

The same will apply to coveted, and influential, midfield duo Guimaraes and Sandro Tonali.

Jacob Murphy, at 30, finally fulfilled the potential Howe believed he had with eight goals and 12 assists in 30 Premier League games, while Isak, inevitably, was the spearhead with 23 goals and adding six assists in 34 league appearances.

At the heart of it all is Howe, whose legendary status on Tyneside has been cemented even further by this landmark and memorable campaign.

He believes Newcastle will be in better shape following their last Champions League appearance during the 2023-24 campaign, when they had an outstanding 4-1 home win over French champions Paris St-Germain but failed to reach the knockout phase.

"The experience we had there the first time will help us no end, I think," admitted Howe.

"We felt we grew through the competition, so I think we are stronger. I think we are better prepared both physically and mentally for the competition ahead."

Newcastle have already had one big parade and party for the Carabao Cup success. The celebrations on Sunday may not reach those heights, but the significance of what has been achieved, albeit with their season ending in defeat, cannot be underestimated.

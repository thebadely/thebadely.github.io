Here’s what you need to know: Organisers of some Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall have postponed or cancelled events due to a yellow weather warning for wind.

The Met Office warning is in place for the South West from 04:00 until 23:59 GMT on Christmas Day, with gusts of up to 65mph forecast. There is also a yellow cold-health alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UHSA).

Organisers of the annual Coverack swim, in Cornwall, said its Christmas Day swim had been postponed for the first time in its 57-year history.

Several Boxing Day swims have been cancelled in Devon. 

The Met Office warning also affects Somerset and a large swathe of Wales.  

It says east to northeasterly winds will become particularly strong and gusty during Christmas Day, with peak gusts fairly widely of 45-55mph, and 55-65mph possible along some exposed coasts. 

Large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts, it adds.

Organisers of the Coverack swim said with the weather forecast, it would be "too dangerous" for the event to go ahead.

The swim has been postponed until New Year's Day, organisers added.

Start Bay Inn, in Devon, said it was "really sad" to announce its Boxing Day swim had been cancelled.

It said on social media: "We are really sad to say that due to the rough NE wind it will be too rough here at Torcross for our annual swim."

RNLI Teignmouth said it had made the "difficult decision" to cancel its Boxing Day walk in the sea event.

It said: "The annual event, which usually sees hundreds of participants take a festive dip in support of RNLI lifesavers, has long been a highlight of the Boxing Day calendar. 

"While organisers understand the disappointment this decision may cause, safety considerations must come first."

The Royal Air Force Air Cadets 200 Squadron Torquay said on social media on Tuesday, Torbay Council's Boxing Day Dip at Torre Abbey had been cancelled.

It said a statement from the council said: "With reference to the Boxing Day Dip hosted by Torbay Council which 200 Squadron has been a part of for many years, unfortunately the RNLI have advised to cancel the Torre Abbey Boxing Day Dip due to large swells and easterly winds producing rough seas on Boxing Day and therefore the Boxing Day Dip at Torre Abbey Sands is cancelled for everyone's safety.  

"We understand that this is disappointing for some however the safety of all participating is paramount and we must ensure all are safe at this event."

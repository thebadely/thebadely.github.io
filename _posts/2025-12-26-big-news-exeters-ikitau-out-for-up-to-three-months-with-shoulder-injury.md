According to new developments, Len Ikitau agreed a one-season deal to join Exeter earlier this year

Exeter's Australia centre Len Ikitau is likely to be out for three months after injuring his shoulder.

The 27-year-old is set to undergo surgery for the injury, which he suffered in the win over Saracens last week, and is likely to be out until the end of the Six Nations in March.

Ikitau was Exeter's most high-profile summer signing after agreeing to a one-season move to Sandy Park earlier this year.

He featured for the Wallabies against the British and Irish Lions and in the Rugby Championship over the summer.

It will be a blow to the Chiefs, who have seen Ikitau impress in a midfield alongside England centre Henry Slade that has helped Exeter go second in the Prem.

Ikitau would turn down R360 to play at World Cup

Ikitau has made five appearances for Exeter in the Prem and European Challenge Cup, scoring his first try in the win over South African side Cheetahs earlier this month. 

"The good news is that we can get him in for the operation pretty quickly, though unfortunately it does mean he will miss the block of games over the festive period and into the cup competitions in the new year," Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter told the club website., external 

"It's very unfortunate for Len, who has been playing out of his skin for us and was in outstanding form. It's a shame for him and a shame for us because he's been an important part of what we've achieved so far this season.

"However, after a pretty long period of quite intense rugby, it will give him a bit of a break and give his body plenty of time to recover and refresh. 

"Hopefully, he can have a big end of the season impact for us, and we'll remain in contention to be challenging for some success or silverware."

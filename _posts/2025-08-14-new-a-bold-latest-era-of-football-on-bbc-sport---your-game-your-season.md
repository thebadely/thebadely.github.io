It has been recently reported that Welcome to the new football season.

You know the feeling. That buzz in your stomach. That hopeful voice in your head saying "this could be our year". The highs, the heartbreak, the glorious unpredictability of it all. 

From the first whistle to the last-minute drama, we're right there with you. On the edge of our seats, refreshing the live page, wincing at referees or VAR, shouting at the TV, arguing in the group chat. We are fans. Just like you.

And that's what this new era of football on BBC Sport is all about... you.

This season, we're not just covering the games. We're following the fans. Every goal, every story, every stat, every moment. Brought to you where you want it, when you want it, and how you love it. 

Whether you're shouting for Liverpool or loving Lionesses, whether you back Chelsea Women or Cheltenham Town, you're at the heart of everything we do.

We're making football coverage for fans. And this year, it's bolder, deeper, and more connected than ever before. All of it free. All of it for everyone.

Kelly Cates, Gabby Logan and Mark Chapman are BBC Match of the Day's new presenting team

We're taking you inside the game more than ever before. That means new shows. New formats. New voices. New perspectives. More radio commentaries than we've ever had across the leagues. More updates on the club pages on our app and website up and down the pyramid.

We'll also be showing you the key parts of Premier League games sooner. On Saturday and Sundays there will be highlights on iPlayer, our app and website available at 8pm (weekday matches or late weekend kick-offs are more like half an hour after full-time).

BBC Sport's flagship football show, Match of the Day, returns with a brand-new presenting trio ready to bring insight, energy and entertainment every week. 

Full-time reaction on the BBC Sport app, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport's YouTube channel along with TV's excellent Final Score programme will ensure you're up to date (including how your fantasy team has done). 

Then tactical breakdowns and unpicking of the big talking points that go beyond the obvious will take you closer to the players, the managers and the moments that matter, on the main show later that night. And it's the same again for Champions League Wednesdays.

We're bringing in a true legend of the game, Wayne Rooney, to host a brand-new show diving into the football debates that are dominating your algorithm every week. 

Wayne will bring his authority, honesty and experience to cut through the noise and give you the game as it really is. You'll find it on iPlayer, Sounds, the BBC Sport app and website, YouTube and other social channels and it's going to be funny, punchy and a perfect companion to the week.

You'll also get fresh new formats like The Football Interview with Kelly Somers - a show that goes past the post-match platitudes and into the personal stories that define the beautiful game. And by the game we don't just mean the Premier League - we'll be telling stories from men and women across the world.

On 5 Live, we're turning up the volume with 209 Premier League commentaries this season, more than any UK broadcaster. 

That's why we're the true home of the Premier League. In Scotland and Northern Ireland there is extensive live coverage of the Scottish Premiership and NIFL Premiership across the season. 

BBC Local Radio has you covered outside of the top flight too with more than 5,000 commentaries a year across the English football pyramid.

And of course, all the things you already love are still here. Live pages that bring the drama to your fingertips. Fixtures, results, and tables to help you plan your week (and your mood). 

The Monday Night Club, Football Focus, The Women's Football Show and a host of 5 Live shows and podcasts bringing brilliant debate and deep insight. Live coverage of the men's FA Cup, Women's Super League, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland World Cup qualifiers and Champions League highlights. 

And yes, the BBC Sport socials will still have you doomscrolling and laughing in equal measure.

This is football, like you've always loved it but reimagined for right now.

This is your game, your voice, your season.

And we're here for every minute of it.

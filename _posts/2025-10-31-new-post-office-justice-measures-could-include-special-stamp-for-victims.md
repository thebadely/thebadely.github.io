According to new developments, Victims of the Horizon Post Office scandal could meet face-to-face with Fujitsu and Post Office representatives as part of a restorative justice effort.

The charity overseeing a new scheme said the first five months were an initial pilot phase, but it hoped the scheme would last five years and include extra initiatives such as a special commemorative postage stamp.

It comes on top of the various financial compensation schemes in place for sub-postmasters.

The Horizon IT scandal saw hundreds of sub-postmasters falsely accused of embezzling Post Office funds after faulty software suggested money was missing from their branch accounts.

More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted because of incorrect information from the Horizon computer system.

Restorative justice is a process in the criminal justice system which brings the victims of an injustice and the people responsible together in a bid to repair harm caused. 

The first face-to-face meetings under the scheme could take place as early as December, and also include representatives from the Department for Business and Trade. 

However, the process is voluntary, so while victims can request to speak directly to specific individuals - for example the former boss of the Post Office, Paula Vennells - ex-executives are not obliged to take part.

The Post Office has already held some restorative meetings between sub-postmasters and its former chief executive, Nick Read.

But this would mark the first time representatives of Fujitsu, the company responsible for the faulty software at the heart of the scandal, have been involved in a restorative meeting with sub-postmasters affected. 

Fujitsu representatives have met with Lost Chances, the group formed to campaign on behalf of the adult children of affected sub-postmasters.

The Restorative Justice Council (RJC), which was asked to come up with the programme, said the aim was to rebuild trust and support among the sub-postmasters and their families.

Jim Simon, chief executive of the Restorative Justice Council, said the process was not just about addressing past harms, but also about "creating a safe and compassionate space for individuals to share their stories and begin their healing journeys". 

The RJC held events with over a hundred victims to establish what they wanted to see from a restorative programme.

The initial phase will operate from now until March next year, and include a phone helpline and support service staffed by restorative justice practitioners. 

A full formal programme is expected to be launched in April 2026.

The idea for a commemorative postage stamp was suggested by sub-postmasters, and could help raise funds for Lost Chances and educational initiatives related to the scandal.

Funding is provided by the government, the Post Office, which is state-owned, and Fujitsu. 

Current Post Office chief executive Neil Brocklehurst, said it was time to "establish a lasting and meaningful restorative justice programme which is directly informed by the wishes of those who were harmed."

Paul Patterson, Fujitsu's chief executive for Europe, said the restorative process was an important step and that it would help ensure "lessons are learned".

"We deeply regret Fujitsu's role in sub-postmasters' suffering and recognise the profound impact it has had on them and their families," he said.

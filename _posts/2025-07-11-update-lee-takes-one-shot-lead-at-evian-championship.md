South Korea's Somi Lee shot a six-under par 65 to take a one-stroke lead after the second round of the Evian Championship.

The 26-year-old made six birdies and eagled the par-five ninth, as well as making two bogeys, to go into the weekend on 10-under.

"This course is so beautiful, but the green is so tricky, so I'm just [practising] distance," Lee said.

"I'm just [focused] on distance. Miss left, miss right, never mind. Just distance - is it perfect."

Australia's Grace Kim is a shot back on nine-under after four birdies and a bogey in her 68 on Friday at Evian Resort Golf Club in Evian-les-Bains.

Jennifer Kupcho of the US is third on eight-under after a wild round of 69 that included seven birdies and five bogeys.

Ireland's Leona Maguire was one of five co-leaders after a hole-in-one on the opening round and remains in contention, four shots off the lead after a second-round 71.

The Evian Championship is the fourth of this season's five LPGA majors.

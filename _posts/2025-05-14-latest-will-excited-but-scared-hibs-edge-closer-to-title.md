According to new developments, Hibernian are within touching distance of an unexpected SWPL title win

Scottish Women's Premier League: Hibernian v Celtic

Venue: Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh Date: Wednesday 14 May Kick-off: 18:00 BST

Coverage: Watch on BBC Alba, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website & app

It is understandable Hibernian head coach Grant Scott's nerves are jangling as the Scottish Women's Premier League appears destined to go down to yet another final-day decider.

With two games to go, Hibs sit top - three points ahead of treble-hunters Rangers and 16-time record winners Glasgow City. 

For each of the past two campaigns since the SWPL split was introduced, managing director Fiona McIntyre has spent the last day of the season in car with the trophy, pulling the odd U-turn as the drama unfolded.

The 'big three' of Celtic, Rangers and Glasgow City have all been involved, but this year, the surprise package from the east are in the driving seat.

Hibs were the bridesmaid seven times during City's 14-year stranglehold of the SWPL and have not won the league since 2007.

However, two more victories - against Celtic on Wednesday and Rangers on Sunday at Ibrox, no less - and they will have pulled off the unthinkable. 

How does Scott feel about that? 

"Excited, incredibly proud, but also really scared," he replied.

'True inspiration' - Scotland great Ross to retire

Hibs have timed their run to the summit perfectly, first moving level on points with City on 2 March. Since then, they have not been budged.

They could have had an even comfier cushion heading into the penultimate round of fixtures but drew with Leanne Ross' City in the capital on Sunday.

That could yet prove to be a precious point as it is one that keeps their fate in their own hands on Wednesday, at least.

While Hibs host Celtic - who they are undefeated against this campaign - second-placed Rangers travel to Heart of Midlothian, with City at Motherwell.

Should both chasers suffer unlikely defeats, and Hibs get the job done against the deposed champions, the Leith side could be announced champions on the night. 

Grant, though, insists he has "not at all" thought of that possibility.

"Two 90 minutes of football determines where we finish, that's the simplicity and beauty of the game," Grant told BBC Scotland.

"That gives you the nervous fear that hopefully gives you the right energy to keep performing.

"We're all dreaming about what could be, we're just trying to ground ourselves, but it's getting harder and harder the closer it gets."

For weeks, Scott and his players have batted away the suggestion they could cause a stir and secure the title. Now he is asking them to soak it all in.

"Honestly, this week, whatever happens, it goes to the last day of the season and that's just mega exciting," he said. 

"I just hope the players soak up the privilege of being in that position because they've worked so hard to get there and, as long as we turn up, I'll be happy."

Happy he might be, but how will Scott cope in the run up to Sunday's showdown?

"Truthfully, I don't know," he replied. "I don't know how I'll sleep, how I'll recover the players, how I'll keep a lid on it all, I have no idea."

Jo Potter's Rangers remain in contention for a domestic treble

Rangers head coach Jo Potter already has one trophy in the bag this season after her side thrashed Hibs 5-0 in the SWPL Cup final. 

With Potter's team also facing City in this month's Women's Scottish Cup final, a domestic treble is still on, something she regards as "crazy" considering she thinks her side are "fortunate" to be back in the title race.

If either Hibs or City had won their game on Sunday, Rangers would have been needing favours from elsewhere, but now they know, thanks to their superior goal difference, that two consecutive wins will be enough to secure the title they narrowly lost to Celtic last season. 

"It's better than it was last year because we lost out on goal difference," she said. "We said from very early doors that we don't want to feel that feeling again and we've got ourselves in a really healthy position. That's comforting for us."

Sunday's 1-0 win away to reigning champions Celtic was a potential banana skin survived, but Potter pointed out that her side "must turn up to Hearts first" - a side who recently beat Hibs on their own patch - before thinking of a potential title showdown against the current leaders.

As she prepared to face former side Motherwell, City assistant Leanne Crichton, who was a serial title winner with her club as a player, expects the title race to go down to the final day.

"There's a reason why Hibs are still at the top of the table - because they're a good side, they've got experienced players, they've got quality, they've got a good manager," she told BBC Scotland's Behind the Goals podcast.

"There's still so much to play for. The Champions League spots as well are absolutely massive. 

"Ultimately, if you cannot win the league, the next big thing is European football. The three teams at the top have still got it all to play for. It feels like it could be another final-day drama."

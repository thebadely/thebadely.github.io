Experts revealed that Citizens Advice is expecting a "surge in demand" for its services this winter, as people who are already struggling with fuel debt face further bills.

The organisation said half of the 1,000 people it saw in Hull and East Yorkshire in relation to fuel poverty were already in debt with energy companies.

Jessica Smith, data and insights officer at the charity, said fuel poverty caused a "vicious cycle" that led to damp homes, further debt, illness and mental health struggles.

She said cold temperatures this winter could lead to a "really, really difficult time for people" and urged those affected by fuel poverty and other issues to get in touch with the charity.

Ms Smith said: "We can help people look at repayment plans, how they can reduce their energy consumption.

"But the absolute crux of it is there are a lot of people that have done everything they can and they're still in a situation where they're choosing between heating and eating."

The data was taken from clients seeking support between April 2024 and May 2025.

Across Hull and East Yorkshire, the organisation supported almost 1,300 people who reported a total of 1,468 cold and damp issues. There were 1,258 requests for emergency fuel vouchers.

Half of those needing fuel vouchers also needed support from a local food bank.

Of those requesting support for damp homes, a quarter were also struggling with mental health issues.

Ms Smith said living in a cold, damp home while having to make difficult financial decisions "absolutely has an impact on people's mental health as well as their physical health".

She said seeking help "at the earliest stage possible" could prevent people "getting into that spiral".

She added: "There is support out there and you should absolutely seek out that support."

Ms Smith's concerns were put to energy minister Martin McCluskey.

He told BBC Radio Humberside he did not want to see "anyone struggling with their bills" and urged people in fuel poverty to contact their energy supplier and organisations such as Citizens Advice.

He hoped the Warm Home Discount "would make a difference for those families who need it most" and urged people to check whether they were eligible.

"We want to make sure the cost of energy comes down as quickly as possible, so we're looking at actions across the piece to try and bring bills down," he added.

Hull City Council said its warm homes team was supporting residents through energy efficiency improvements, with the aim of creating homes that are cheaper to heat.

Councillor Paul Drake-Davis, in charge of housing at the local authority, said the service helped residents "find out what support is available to help them heat their homes in an efficient and environmentally friendly way".

He added: "This is particularly important as we help people cope with the cost of living crisis, where team members can advise about things like home improvements or grants that residents may be eligible for."

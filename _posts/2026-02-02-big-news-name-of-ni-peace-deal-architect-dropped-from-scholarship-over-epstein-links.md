Here’s what you need to know: A scholarship bearing the name of a former United States senator who played a crucial role in Northern Ireland's peace process is to be dropped over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The US-Ireland Alliance has decided that the George J Mitchell Scholarship Program will no longer bear his name.

It said this was due to information within millions of files relating to Epstein which were released by the US Department of Justice on Friday, including further references to an earlier claim that he had sex with one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Giuffre.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Mitchell said he never met, spoke to or had any contact with Giuffre or any underage women.

The spokesperson said Mitchell did not at any time observe, suspect or have any knowledge of Epstein engaging in "illegal or inappropriate conduct with underage women".

The latest release of documents shows a continued relationship between Mitchell and Epstein, following Epstein's first conviction.

This includes emails about the former senator to and from Epstein, as well as memos with appointments scheduled between the pair.

In an email to Epstein on 4 November 2013, it states Mitchell was due to meet him, as is shown by the entry, "10:30am Appt w/Senator George Mitchell."

Epstein, a well-connected financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead by suicide in 2019 while awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges.

Previous links between Mitchell and Epstein include a handwritten letter from 2003 released in September during an earlier release of files.

In the letter in what was described as Epstein's "birthday book," Mitchell described his friendship with Epstein as "a blessing".

The letter was released by a US congressional panel as part of a copy of the book alleged to have been given to Epstein to celebrate his 50th birthday.

Mitchell was previously accused of having sex with Giuffre. He denied the allegations.

Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.

In a new statement issued on Monday, a spokesperson for Mitchell said: "In the recently released documents, an allegation involving Senator Mitchell by Ms Virginia Giuffre is repeated. 

"It was first made public in 2020 and denied at the time. That allegation is based on a case of mistaken identity. 

"In 2021, Ms Giuffre supplied a photograph to OK Magazine, which incorrectly captioned it as depicting Senator Mitchell standing behind Jeffrey Epstein. The individual in the photograph was not Senator Mitchell. 

"The publisher acknowledged the incorrect caption and removed it."

The spokesperson added that Mitchell learned of Epstein's criminal activity only through media reports linked to Epstein's prosecution in Florida and declined or deflected the few invitations to events extended by Epstein's office in the years that followed.

"Senator Mitchell profoundly regrets ever having known Jeffrey Epstein and condemns, without reservation, the horrific harm Epstein inflicted on so many women," the spokesperson said.

The Mitchell Scholarship was set up by the US-Ireland Alliance to honour Mitchell and has supported hundreds of US students over the years.

It has not selected new scholars since 2024 due to funding issues.

Mitchell chaired the peace talks that culminated in the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which brought an end to three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles.

The US-Ireland Alliance say the scholarship is designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland.

Up to 12 scholars between the ages of 18 and 30 were chosen annually for a year of postgraduate study in Ireland and Northern Ireland.

In a statement on Sunday, founder and president of the US-Ireland Alliance Trina Vargo said its board of directors had unanimously agreed to change the name of the scholarship.

"The decision was made due to new information that has come to light as part of the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein by the Department of Justice on Friday," Vargo said.

"We are extremely proud of the program and the scholars, and this turn of events in no way diminishes their achievements or our commitment to keeping them connected to the island, the Alliance, and each other.

"This decision allows us to focus on our mission to strengthen the ties between the US and the island of Ireland.  

"Given the current state of the relationship, that is more important than ever."

Vargo said it would take time for the name to be changed on the website, social media accounts and other channels as conversations were needed with organisations, supporters and the Irish government.

The Irish Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science funds and creates policy for the higher and further education and research sectors in the Republic of Ireland.

In the past the department had provided funding to the Mitchell Scholarship.

A spokesperson for the department said it is aware of "this unilateral decision taken by the US‑Ireland Alliance".

"The minister has directed that further engagement be sought with the US-Ireland Alliance in relation to this development and will be seeking the advice of the Attorney General on the appropriate next steps."

Other information contained in the latest release of files includes the suggestion in bank statements that Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to the former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Mandelson.

On Sunday he resigned his membership of the Labour Party, stating he did not want to "cause further embarrassment" by his links to Epstein.

Lord Mandelson said he had no record or recollection of receiving the sums and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

He reiterated his regret for "ever having known Epstein" and for continuing his association following the disgraced financier's conviction, apologising "unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered".

There are also emails between Epstein and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor dated February 2011 - putting more holes in Mountbatten-Windsor's assurances that he had cut off any contact with Epstein the previous year.

There is also a photo that appears to show the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground.

The BBC has contacted Andrew, formerly known as the Duke of York, for a response.

Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

George Mitchell is a former majority leader in the US senate.

He won admiration from across the political divide in Northern Ireland for his work to boost the peace process, chairing the Stormont peace talks during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Following the failure to set up devolved power, Mitchell acted as a facilitator to implement an inclusive power-sharing executive and the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.

After a final 36 hours of non-stop negotiations, he led the main parties to agree to the Good Friday agreement on 10 April 1998, a political deal designed to bring an end to 30 years of violent conflict in Northern Ireland.

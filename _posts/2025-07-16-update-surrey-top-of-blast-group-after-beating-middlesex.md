Match scorecard

Surrey moved to the top of the South Group in the T20 Blast with an eight-run win over Middlesex at Lord's.

An opening partnership of 66 in the first six overs between Will Jacks, who top-scored with 52, and Ryan Patel got Surrey off to a quick start after choosing to bat first.

Tom Curran added a rapid 47 off 22 balls before being dismissed by Ryan Higgins (4-33) as the visitors posted 189-9 from their 20 overs.

Stevie Eskinazi (53) and captain Leus du Plooy (29) led Middlesex's chase but both fell in the same Chris Jordan over to signal the end of their victory hopes.

Du Plooy was narrowly run out by a direct hit before Eskinazi was caught at gully two balls later.

Some big-hitting from Luke Hollman (32 not out) gave Surrey nervous moments late on but his effort came just too late as Middlesex fell short on 181-6.

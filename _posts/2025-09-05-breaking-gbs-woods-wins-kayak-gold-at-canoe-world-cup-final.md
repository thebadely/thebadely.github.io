According to new developments, Kimberley Woods won two bronze medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games

Great Britain's Kimberley Woods clinched gold in the women's kayak single (K1) at the Canoe Slalom World Cup final in Augsburg, Germany.

The 29-year-old won the final stage of the season with Germany's Elena Lilik securing silver while Woods' fellow Briton Lois Leaver took bronze. 

Woods had made it back-to-back gold medals a week after breaking through for her first-ever K1 World Cup title, and in doing so leapfrogged to the top of the overall standings.

She finished on 289 points with Leaver (262) in second and Evy Leibfarth of the USA (260) in third.

"Hopefully I've not peaked too early before the World Championships but I've got a lot of confidence now going into next month's race," Woods said.

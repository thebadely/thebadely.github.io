Experts revealed that The UK government will unveil a new Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) on Monday, backed by £250m in funding, to support regional economic growth and boost innovation in the defence sector.

Defence Secretary John Healey will launch the strategy during a visit to a Bristol-based defence firm on 8 September.

The government says the strategy will offer working families across the country new opportunities such as highly skilled engineering positions or apprenticeships for young people.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the plan would "unleash the power of local economies while securing our country".

The government anticipates that up to 50,000 new defence jobs could be created by 2035. 

At the heart of the strategy are five new Defence Growth Deals, aimed at unlocking the potential of local economies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The £250m fund will be used in collaboration between local authorities, businesses, academia and the defence sector to support job creation, skills development, and innovation.

"These deals offer a new partnership with UK Defence to build on industrial and innovation strengths that regions already hold," said Healey. "Together we aim to drive an increase in defence skills, SMEs and jobs across all four nations."

The first Defence Growth deals will be in the following areas:

The DIS also aims to respond to evolving global threats, such as the war in Ukraine, underscoring the need for rapid innovation and industrial capacity to support national security.

With defence spending set to rise to 2.6% of GDP by 2027 - and an ambition to reach 3% - the government says the DIS is a long-term investment in both security and a high-growth economy.

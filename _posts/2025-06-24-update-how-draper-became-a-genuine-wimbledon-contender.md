Experts revealed that British number one Jack Draper is among the favourites to win this year's men's title

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 3-16 July Venue: All England Club

It is easy to forget Jack Draper is still a Wimbledon novice.

British number one Draper has made only three main-draw appearances at the Championships, winning two of his five matches and never going beyond the second round.

But the left-handed Englishman will be the fourth seed when the grass-court Grand Slam begins next Monday after a stunning rise.

In the space of a year, Draper has reached the US Open semi-finals, clinched the prestigious Indian Wells title and reached two other ATP Tour finals.

"I'd say he's fourth favourite for the Wimbledon title behind Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic," former British number one Greg Rusedski told BBC Sport.

This is how Draper elevated himself from a promising young talent to a genuine Wimbledon contender.

Draper's potential has been clear from a young age and, having struggled with his fitness in his early years, he is now starting to realise it.

Two years ago, Draper lamented being the "guy who is always injured" and ultimately had to withdraw from Wimbledon with a shoulder issue.

That led to a concerted effort to improve his strength and stamina.

The hard graft started with fitness trainer Steve Kotze and physio Will Herbert before Draper reshaped his team with Matt Little and Shane Annun - long-time associates of Andy Murray - filling those same roles.

Winning a trio of gruelling five-setters at January's Australian Open indicated he had become a different beast, and his ability to outlast opponents physically has continued over the past six months.

After reaching the Queen's semi-finals last week, Draper joked he previously "looked like a bit of a Ferrari, but I was a bit of a Toyota" because his body used to break down easily.

Now, standing at 6ft 4in and looking increasingly muscular, that perception has changed, with Alexander Bublik remarking the Briton looks like he is "getting ready for UFC".

Not worrying about his body breaking down means Draper can have more trust in executing his key weapons, which are well-suited to the grass.

Coach James Trotman, a fellow Briton who has come through the LTA's coaching pathway, is helping Draper learn how to play aggressively in the right moments.

That means being willing to play higher-risk drop-shots and spring forwards to the net, as well as unleashing his groundstrokes from the baseline.

"He's much more aware what his strengths are - that is the biggest change this year," said Leon Smith, Britain's Davis Cup captain.

"You don't want to be extending points if you have the chance to get the first strike in.

"He's not afraid to step in and be brave, including in the big moments."

Being willing to take risks under pressure has been where Draper has excelled this season, according to the ATP statistics.

Draper is second behind world number one Sinner in the Tour's 'under pressure rating' - which combines the percentage of break points converted, break points saved, tie-breaks won and deciding sets won.

The power and variety of Draper's serve enables him to start points strongly.

When he lands his first serve, it is effective. His first-serve percentage is only the 43rd best on the ATP Tour this year, but he is 14th in terms of points won behind it.

A slight dip in his serve contributed to his Queen's semi-final exit - a warning that such a dip can be punished in high-quality matches of fine margins.

"He's got every kind of serve you can imagine," said former British women's number one Annabel Croft.

"It allows him to get quicker, freer points - that's a huge advantage on a grass court."

Draper's forehand provides plenty of firepower and he has been working on improving its effectiveness on the grass.

Rasping winners at Queen's - both stepping in from the baseline and running shots down the line - were encouraging signs.

"When that ball is coming in fast, especially on a grass court, you have to stay low and stay down," said Draper.

"Just the slightest movement in your head or lifting up and the ball is going to fly."

It is not the first time Draper will arrive at Wimbledon as the British number one, but he will face more scrutiny now.

No home player has been seeded as high at the All England Club since world number one and defending champion Andy Murray in 2017.

Draper is a confident young man who thrives on the big stage and is not afraid to whip up the crowd - but he has faced issues with nerves in the past.

Consulting a breathing coach has been beneficial but it will be interesting to see how Draper copes with the increased focus of a wider British audience.

"Dealing with expectation when you're playing well is easy because you use the crowd to fuel you," said Rusedski, who reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 1997.

"It's when you're not playing well that pressure becomes difficult. You end up trying too hard and that never works out well.

"You have to organically allow it to happen if you're putting in the work, and Jack is doing that."

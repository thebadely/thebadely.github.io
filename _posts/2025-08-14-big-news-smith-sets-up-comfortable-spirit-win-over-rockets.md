Scorecard. Table

England batter Jamie Smith's half-century set up a comfortable 21-run win for London Spirit at Lord's, inflicting a first defeat on Trent Rockets in The Hundred. 

Smith was promoted to open, a role he fulfils for England's white-ball sides, and struck 52 from 34 balls as Spirit posted a challenging 162-5. 

The visitors made a bright start in reply as Tom Banton and Joe Root added 73 for the first wicket, but they fell away after the former's departure and crawled to 141-6.

Rockets were ultimately punished for a sloppy fielding effort. Smith was put down on 23 and 26, while Kane Williamson was also dropped twice in making 45 as the pair added 73 for the second wicket. 

Smith clubbed four sixes and two fours while Williamson showed his sublime touch and class in a 32-ball knock that followed Australian David Warner's departure for six. 

Warner's compatriot Ashton Turner provided a late cameo of 30 from16 balls, while Ollie Pope made 17 from nine, to complete a much-improved batting effort after Spirit's previous performance on home turf saw them bowled out for just 80.

Banton led the charge in his opening stand with Root but the course of the game changed when he played on to his stumps off Jamie Overton, who struggled through his 20 balls with an injury that could be a cause for concern for Spirit.

Banton's departure sparked a collapse of four wickets for 17 runs, including Root for 27 and Rehan Ahmed for a duck, and their task became even more difficult when Tom Alsop was struck by an Overton bouncer that burst through his helmet and he had to retire hurt. 

Marcus Stoinis clubbed four sixes late on in a characteristically dynamic 35 not out from 22 balls but Rockets still fell considerably short.

Smith hits quickfire 52 after being dropped twice

Smith's promotion meant Spirit were using their third different opening combination in four games but they seem to have finally found the right fit.

The wicketkeeper was aggressive from the outset, whacking two sixes in his first five balls off Rockets skipper David Willey and found the perfect companion in Williamson, who seemed much more comfortable at number three after Warner was caught at cover off Lockie Ferguson.

Williamson had opened twice previously and made unconvincing scores of 14 and 19 but was back to his best, delighting the Lord's crowd with his trademark deft touches behind the keeper and exquisite cover drives. 

Rockets' bowlers were guilty of offering too much width for him to play those shots but they were also let down in the field. Adam Hose spilled Smith on 23, Ferguson misjudged a chance at long-on when he had 26 before he almost got redemption, only for Alsop to put one down behind the stumps with Williamson on 22. 

Hose's nightmare evening continued as he could not hold on to another at deep cover with Williamson on 38.

The pair ensured they punished Rockets to set a solid platform, and Turner and Pope added a rapid 46 in just 20 balls to take the game beyond the visitors. 

It will be a morale-boosting win for Spirit after an inconsistent start to their campaign, with the batting effort backed up by a fine all-round bowling effort, although Overton's injury could be significant for their hopes going forward.

Northern Superchargers' women will be looking to keep the pressure on the top two as they take on Birmingham Phoenix at 15:00 BST.

The men's game follows at 18:30 BST with Phoenix hoping to gather momentum after they beat leaders Oval Invincibles in their most recent game on Tuesday.

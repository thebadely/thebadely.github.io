Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Cardiff winger Ollie Tanner will have a scan to find our the severity of his ankle injury

Cardiff City fear that winger Ollie Tanner could face a long spell on the sidelines after suffering an ankle injury in their 1-0 win at AFC Wimbledon on Tuesday night.

The 23-year-old, who has only recently signed a new four-year contract, collided with an advertising board just before half-time and had to be carried off.

"It was an ankle injury, it didn't look a good incident and it's not an insignificant injury, it looks pretty serious," said Cardiff head coach Brian Barry-Murphy.

"We'll scan it tomorrow [Wednesday] and reassess from there, but he's on crutches at the moment and will be going to hospital."

Tanner was hurt trying to prevent the ball going out for a goal kick.

"In this moment he'll regret going for the ball but that's the natural instincts of a player of his qualities to go for the ball and never give up on it," Barry-Murphy added.

"There's no point looking back, from this moment onwards we'll look forward to help Ollie in every way we can and make sure he has a speedy recovery to get back as soon as possible."

Cardiff's win, which continued their unbeaten start under new boss Barry-Murphy, came courtesy of Isaak Davies' 92nd-minute winner and kept the Bluebirds second in League One as they chase an immediate return to the Championship.

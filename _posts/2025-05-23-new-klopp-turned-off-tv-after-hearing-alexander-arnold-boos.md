Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Klopp said Trent Alexander-Arnold was key in delivering success for the club during his reign

Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he turned off his television when he heard supporters booing Trent Alexander-Arnold.

The 26-year-old defender is leaving the club at the end of the season and is expected to join Real Madrid.

Alexander-Arnold arrived at the club aged six and was a key component in Liverpool's success under German Klopp, which included a first league title in 30 years in 2019-20.

However after announcing his decision to not sign a new contract, some fans turned against the player and some booed him when he came off the substitutes bench against Arsenal earlier this month.

Speaking at a fundraising event for the LFC Foundation on Friday, where he brought along a signed Alexander-Arnold shirt to auction, the ex-manager said supporters were "wrong" to boo and launched a passionate defence of the England full-back.

"I don't want to tell you what you have to think. I can tell you what you think is wrong," Klopp said.

"I don't tell you you should not be angry, you should not be disappointed, I tell you don't forget. This club doesn't forget.

"I watched the game when he came on and I heard the booing. I switched the telly [television] off. Honestly, I could not have been more disappointed at this moment."

And he highlighted the Liverpool-born player's commitment to the club during Klopp's spell as manager.

"I was there. I can tell you, this boy he gave absolutely everything," he said.

The 26-year-old has been named in the Three Lions squad for upcoming games against Andorra and Senegal, having been injured for the March camp.

Though admired for his offensive ability, England boss Thomas Tuchel said he had told the player he needs to improve his "defensive discipline" if he is to help his country to win a major tournament.

"I can see that sometimes he relies heavily on his offensive contributions, and gives not so much emphasis on the defensive discipline and effort," Tuchel said.

"This major impact that he had for Liverpool over so many years, if he wants to have this impact in the English national team, then he has to take the defensive part very, very seriously.

"Because when we are talking, especially, about qualifying football and then tournament football, the one defensive error, the one moment where you are not 100% awake, can be decisive, can be the moment where you pack your suitcases and go home."

'I wasn't completely happy with his training' - Slot on Alexander-Arnold

Also speaking on Friday, Liverpool manager Arne Slot said he had spoken to Alexander-Arnold about his defending and stressed he "could do a bit more, to say it mildly" in training to improve, but that he was a better defender than people give him credit for.

England face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier on 7 June, before welcoming Senegal to Nottingham Forest's City Ground for a friendly on 10 June.

"Now is the moment to get to know him," added Tuchel. 

"I know him. I played against him. I had phone calls with him. But now is the moment to feel him for nine or 10 days, feel him around the squad, see what he can do, what he can bring, and then from there we go."

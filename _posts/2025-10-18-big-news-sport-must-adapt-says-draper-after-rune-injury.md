Here’s what you need to know: Holger Rune has won five tour-level titles

British number one Jack Draper says the tennis calendar must be adapted after Holger Rune became the latest high-profile player to have his season ended prematurely.

Danish 22-year-old Rune, set to return to the world's top 10 after reaching the semi-finals at the Nordic Open in Stockholm, was forced to retire with injury when leading Frenchman Ugo Humbert by a set.

Rune's mother, Aneke, later told Danish newspaper BT that she had been informed by medical staff that her son's injury was "very bad".

She said: "They are completely sure that it is a torn Achilles tendon, so it's of course very bad. Holger is completely devastated. They say they can see it with the naked eye."

Draper wrote on X: "Injuries are going to happenâ¦ we are pushing our bodies to do things they aren't supposed to in elite sport. 

"We have so many incredible younger guys on the tour right now and I'm proud to be a part of that.

"However, the tour and the calendar have to adapt if any of us are going to achieve some sort of longevity."

Rune, nursing a hamstring issue coming into the match, appeared instantly aware of the severity of his injury and was emotional as he received treatment after hobbling to his chair.

He had pulled up in pain after jumping to hit a ball at the back of the court, with the game level at 40-40 on Humbert's serve and Rune leading 6-4 2-2.

Humbert said: "It was not the way I wanted to win. I'm super disappointed for Holger, I hope he is going to be OK. 

"I wish him a speedy recovery. It was a great match, he was playing a little bit better than me, but I'm really sorry for Holger."

Later on Saturday, Novak Djokovic also retired after losing the first set of his third-place play-off against Taylor Fritz at the Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia - an exhibition event - having struggled with injury and sickness at last week's Shanghai Masters.

Carlos Alcaraz, who finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at the Saudi Arabia event which is not part of the ATP Tour, criticised the congested tennis calendar in September, saying "they are going to kill us in some way".

Naomi Osaka became the latest high-profile player to withdraw from a tournament because of injury when she pulled out of the Japan Open with a leg problem before her quarter-final on Friday.

Former women's world number one Iga Swiatek complained in September that the season is "too long and too intense" amid a string of injuries among players at the China Open.

British number one Emma Raducanu called time on her season on Thursday after she was forced to retire from her two previous matches with illness.

Australia's Daria Kasatkina, Ukraine's Elina Svitolina and Spain's Paula Badosa also ended their seasons earlier than planned in recent weeks, citing either injury or a need to take a break from the tour.

According to new developments, Daniel Farke waving to the crowd after Leeds came back from two goals down to draw with Liverpool

Leeds United's supporters might have gone into the week with a sense of dread - but they have ended it with renewed hope of staying in the Premier League. 

Their heroic comeback to draw 3-3 against champions Liverpool at Elland Road capped an eight-days spell in which they picked up four points in three of their toughest fixtures. 

Sky Sports' Gary Neville summed up Leeds' week perfectly: "We thought it was a week that could condemn Leeds to the Championship, but it has been a week of hope for Leeds."

When under-pressure Daniel Farke's side stepped out at Etihad Stadium to take on Manchester City on 29 November, they were locked in the bottom three. They fell behind in the first minute. 

City were expected to go on and post a cricket score after taking a 2-0 lead, but Leeds fought back to level the match - only falling 3-2 to a 91st-minute Phil Foden winner. 

Despite being on a four-game losing run, Leeds optimism was on the rise with a raucous Elland Road waiting for Chelsea on Wednesday. 

Leeds simply proved too much for Enzo Maresca's side and dragged themselves out of the bottom three with a stunning 3-1 win. 

To cap a week to remember, Leeds rallied from 2-0 down against Liverpool to pull level - and after going behind again, found a dramatic late equaliser for 3-3. 

The pressure may have eased on boss Farke for now after a game he described as "one of the magic nights at Elland Road".

For Farke, the pressure was close to boiling point, with BBC Sport reporting that, according to sources, the process of identifying potential replacements had already begun.

But with four points against three of England's top teams in eight days, Farke's job will be safe for now. 

The Leeds boss was asked by Sky Sports if this was one of his best weeks as a Premier League manager, and said: "No, one of the most exhausting ones. 

"If you play against Pep Guardiola, Enzo Maresca and today against Arne Slot and their world-class teams, we know in terms of quality we can't compete with them, so we have to be spot on in tactical terms and try and surprise them sometimes and change the game a little bit. 

"Yes, it's joyful after the game to get good results but, to be honest, I'm happy that I can spend the weekend with coffee and cake on the sofa."

Even when Leeds lost four in a row, Farke insists he "never lost faith".

"It's not a question I am even thinking about - because before this week, I was 100% convinced," he added. "I work with these guys every day and I see what it means to them and how united they are and their spirit and togetherness.

"It is outstanding. I am a big believer that you get what you invest in and these boys are willing to invest and to present this club in the best possible way. 

"It's a long road. Nothing is achieved yet, but we should take lots of confidence out of this."

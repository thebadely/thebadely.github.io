Joe Coyd scored a try two minutes from time as England produced a stunning second-half fightback to beat Australia in the final Test and win the Wheelchair Rugby League Ashes.

Australia led 30-18 at half-time, but England scored six tries after the break to clinch the series 2-0 at the Gold Coast Sports and Leisure Centre in Queensland.

England also came from behind to win the first Test 56-28 on Thursday.

Diab Karim opened the scoring for Australia with a try after two minutes of the second Test.

Two tries from England's Rob Hawkins, who scored a hat-trick in the opening Test, and one from Finlay O'Neill were cancelled out by two Bayley McKenna scores, and Adam Tannock and Dan Anstey tries.

Jack Brown instigated England's fightback in the second half, scoring twice and setting up two tries for captain Lewis King, who ended with a hat-trick.

Tries from Zac Schumacher and Anstey brought Australia level at 42-42 before England substitute Mason Billington's cool final pass sent Coyd over for the winner.

Australia host the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup in 2026.

England and France have dominated the tournament since its inception in 2008, but the 'Wheelaroos' showed their development in this series.

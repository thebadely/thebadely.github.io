Let's dive into the details: Tadej Pogacar (centre) is aiming to win his fourth Tour de France 

The 112th edition of the Tour de France is under way, with the three-week race ending on the Champs-Elysees in Paris on Sunday, 27 July. 

The riders tackle six mountain stages, including trips to the Pyrenees and Alps, during the gruelling 3,320km (2,063-mile) race.

There are also two individual time trials, with the second featuring the steep climb up to the Altiport in Peyragudes.

BBC Sport looks at all 21 stages of La Grande Boucle analysing where it could be won and lost.

This page will be updated throughout the Tour with the winner and a brief report following each stage.

Jasper Philipsen became the first sprinter to claim the yellow jersey on the opening day since 2020

Winner: Jasper Philipsen

Report: Philipsen wins stage one to claim first yellow jersey

Jasper Philipsen was the first rider to wear the yellow jersey this year - claiming the maillot jaune for the first time in his career.

A sprint finish was expected after a flat stage beginning and ending in Lille, and Alpecin-Deceuninck's lead-out train delivered the 27-year-old in the perfect position to claim his 10th stage win.

Crosswinds contributed to a chaotic opening day, which saw the peloton split about 17km from the finish, with most of Philipsen's team-mates in the lead group.

Mathieu van der Poel won his second ever stage at the Tour de France

Winner: Mathieu van der Poel

Report: Van der Poel pips Pogacar in stage two sprint finish

Mathieu van der Poel edges out Tadej Pogacar in a sprint finish to win stage two of the Tour de France and claim the leader's yellow jersey.

The Dutch rider, who also won the same stage in 2021, holds off the three-time Tour champion on the line after surging to the front with 500 metres to go on the longest stage in this year's race, a rolling 209.1km route from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer.

Tim Merlier won his only previous stage at the Tour in 2021

Winner: Tim Merlier

Report: Merlier pips Milan in crash-marred stage three of Tour

Tim Merlier pips Jonathan Milan on the line in a sprint finish to win a crash-marred stage three of the Tour de France.

The Belgian edges the Italian by the slenderest of margins with Germany's Phil Bauhaus in third on a day when Mathieu van der Poel retains the race leader's yellow jersey and stage one winner Jasper Philipsen is forced to abandon.

Tadej Pogacar is aiming for his fourth triumph at the Tour de France

Winner: Tadej Pogacar

Report: Pogacar claims 100th victory on stage four of Tour

Defending champion Tadej Pogacar outsprints Mathieu van der Poel and Jonas Vingegaard as he claims his 100th professional victory on stage four. The result leaves the Slovenian level on time with Dutch rider at the top of the general classification with Van der Poel retaining the leader's yellow jersey on count-back.

Remco Evenepoel is the world and Olympic time-trial champion

Winner: Remco Evenepoel

Report: Evenepoel wins stage five as Pogacar claims yellow jersey

Remco Evenepoel wins the individual time trial on stage five of the Tour de France as Tadej Pogacar takes the yellow jersey from Mathieu van der Poel.

The Belgian rider averages 54kmh to finish 16 seconds quicker than Slovenia's three-time champion Pogacar, with Italy's Edoardo Affini, third, 33 seconds back.

Meanwhile, Denmark's two-time winner Jonas Vingegaard has a day to forget, losing more than a minute to Pogacar in the general classification.

This is the sixth time Vire will have featured on the Tour de France route 

Six categorised climbs and more than 3,400m of vertical gain mean this is regarded as the most challenging flat stage in the Tour's recent history.

A difficult day in the saddle concludes with a 700m-long 10% ascent to the finish line.

Mathieu van der Poel won his first Tour stage on the Mur-de-Bretagne in 2021

The race passes through the home village of five-time winner Bernard Hinault during a relatively tame opening 175km of stage seven.

However, expect bedlam as the finishing line approaches with a closing circuit that mirrors the 2021 stage. 

The Mur-de-Bretagne, which ramps up above 10% features twice and explosiveness and tactical nous will determine how things play out.

Laval is the birthplace of three-time Tour stage winner Jacky Durand

A largely flat stage with an occasional gentle rise plus a relatively straight final three kilometres in towards the finishing line marks this as a day for the sprinters. 

Mark Cavendish won three of his 35 stages in Chateauroux

When you think of Chateauroux one rider immediately springs to mind - Mark Cavendish. 

The first of the Manx Missile's record 35 stage wins arrived in the city in 2008 and he repeated that success on the Avenue de la Chatre in 2011 and 2021. 

And with a relatively simple parcours a bunch sprint will almost certainly be on the menu when the peloton embarks from the historic town of Chinon which is known for its wine.

The last French rider to win on Bastille Day was Warren Barguil in 2017

While the 4,400m of elevation gain across seven category-two climbs and a category-three ascent is likely to put the sprinters in trouble almost from the start, the general classification contenders are likely to keep their powder dry on a stage that looks made for the breakaway specialists.

There will likely be a strong posse of home riders trying to get in any group heading up the road with the objective of becoming the first French stage winner on Bastille Day since Warren Barguil in 2017.

The first trip into the mountains should provide a decent shake up of the GC standings although it unlikely to cause any of the main favourites issues.

Caleb Ewan won the stage last time the Tour visited Toulouse in 2019

Following a rest day, stage 11 offers a gentle return to racing although the concluding 16km contains two kickers that could alter the composition of any fast finish to the line on Boulevard Lascrosses.

Six stage finishes have taken place at Hautacam

The first real big day in the mountains could see fireworks in the GC race. 

The route up to the ski resort at Hautacam on the roads above Lourdes takes the peloton on the route where five-time champion Miguel Indurain tore the race (and his rivals) apart in 1994.

More recently, Jonas Vingegaard rode away from Tadej Pogacar in 2022 on his way to his first overall Tour victory.

The airport runway in Peyragudes was used in a scene in the James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies

An individual time trial takes the riders from the valley floor up to the runway of Altiport 007 in Peyragudes. 

After a flat start, there will be over 8km uphill and no hiding place for the GC favourites in the race of truth. 

A gradient of 7.8% ramps up to a punishing 13% in the final kilometre and it could provide a strong indicator of who will be wearing the yellow jersey in Paris.

Superbagneres hasn't hosted the Tour for 36 years

A classic and mouth-watering mountain stage in the Pyrenees arrives at the end of week two. 

Nearly 5,000m of elevation gain is packed into climbs up the mighty hors-categorie Tourmalet followed by the Col d'Aspin and Col de Peyresourde.

On a day when the GC riders will be need to be at their very best, the strongest climbers will have their focus on the fight for the King of the Mountains jersey and hope to contest the stage on the pull up to the ski resort of Luchon-Superbagneres. 

The gruelling 12.4km slog at 7.3%, which rises up to 10% in a couple of sections, should be the scene for an epic battle in the race for yellow. 

Jasper Philipsen won the first of his eight Tour stage victories in Carcassonne in 2022

A transitional stage arrives as the race heads from the Pyrenees towards the Alps, which looks suited to the strongman sprinters who can cope with some climbing. 

The likes of Wout van Aert and Biniam Girmay should view this a potential chance triumph in the medieval finishing town of Carcassonne.

Chris Froome is the only British rider to have won a stage on Mont Ventoux in the Tour de France

Stage 16 is a flat route until one of the most legendary mountains in Tour history comes into view at the end with the potential to turn the race on its head.

With no categorised climbs all day before Mont Ventoux, and the intermediate sprint featuring 112km into the stage, it would be no surprise if the peloton remains largely intact until then.

In 2016, strong winds meant the finish was moved to Chalet Reynard halfway up the climb as Thomas de Gendt won from the breakaway and drama unfolded on the slopes behind with the yellow jersey, Chris Froome, initially running up the mountain after a crash.

The Tour is stopping in Valence for the fourth time in 10 years

With two big Alpine tests still to come the GC teams will probably play second fiddle to the sprint teams when it comes to trying to rein in any breakaways.

The last three winners of a Tour stage in Valence were Mark Cavendish (2021), Peter Sagan (2018), and Andre Greipel (2015) and the only thing likely to prevent a bunch sprint is the mistral winds that can be fierce in the Rhone Valley.

In 2023 Austria's Felix Gall won the stage into Courchevel

This year's queen stage comes with more than 5,500m of elevation across 171.5km of racing and three legendary climbs which makes it arguably the toughest run of the entire Tour. 

All three ascents fall under the hors categorie, with the Col du Glandon, a 21.7km drag with with sections at double digits just for starters.

The Col de la Madeleine, is shorter but steeper and the while there is a rapid descent and the rises in the road come sharply again on the monstrous Col de la Loze, a climb of over 26km with gradients hitting 11% as the Tour reaches it's highest point.

Albertville was the host city of the 1992 Winter Olympics

The last real mountain stage represents the final opportunity for those high in the GC standings to make a play for the yellow jersey. 

The route from Albertville to La Plagne covers almost 130km, and includes five leg-sapping ascents.

Plenty of points will be up for grabs again in the race for the the polka-dot jersey points available but this is really a last-chance saloon in terms of the overall race.

Whoever is leading at end of the day will be confident, that barring an unforseen disaster, they will be stood atop the podium, draped in yellow on the Champs-Elysees.

This is Pontarlier's first Tour appearance since 2009, when Alberto Contador won the stage to Verbier

The penultimate stage sees the race snake over the hills of the Jura towards Pontarlier.

The rolling terrain should favour an escapee triumphing, while the GC teams protect their leaders.

The Tour will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of its first finish on the Champs-Elysees

The Tour returns to it's traditional Paris finish after relocating to Nice last year due to the Olympics.

However, it does so with a twist, given the cobbled climb up to the Sacre-CÅur Basilica features three times in a throwback to the road race in the 2024 Paris Games.

It's a 1,1km ascent at a gradient of 5.9% added to the original finishing circuit in the French capital designed to whittle down the field before a high-speed finish albeit possibly without some of the pure sprinters.

Here’s what you need to know: Solskjaer scored 126 goals in 11 seasons with Manchester United as a player

Manchester United's appointment of a caretaker manager until the end of the season is reaching its conclusion, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer due to have face-to-face talks about a return to the club on Saturday.

It is understood former midfielder and ex-Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick, the other frontrunner for the role, has already met United chiefs.

United want an appointment before next weekend's Manchester derby.

Club sources have said they regard both men as number one managers in their own right rather than as part of a team, even though the pair worked together following Jose Mourinho's departure in 2018.

Norwegian Solskjaer was appointed in similar circumstances when Mourinho left the club and was given the role permanently in March 2019 after a successful run of results.

The former striker led the club to the Europa League final but was sacked in November 2021 after a poor run of form. He most recently managed Besiktas in Turkey but was sacked in August after losing in the play-offs for both the Europa and Conference League.

In the meantime, Darren Fletcher will continue in interim charge.

Speaking earlier on Friday, Fletcher said he has had no talks about his future and his focus has solely been on the FA Cup third round tie with Brighton.

Fletcher was put in temporary charge for two games following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim.

It has not been established whether Fletcher will remain as part of the first-team set-up or if he will return to his previous job as United's under-18s coach.

The former United and Scotland midfielder confirmed he had not spoken to minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe since Amorim's exit, and there have been no discussions either with chief executive Omar Berrada or director of football Jason Wilcox about what happens after the Brighton game.

"There have been no thoughts or conversations over my future," he said.

"I speak to Omar and Jason, that's how the process works.

"They have given me full responsibility to take control of these two games, to make my own decisions, to lead the team, guide the team and prepare the team. That's what I've been doing.

"I've been focusing on the job at hand and preparing the team for these two games."

Senior figures at Old Trafford are known to be impressed at the way Fletcher has gone about his work this week and how he has handled the external pressures of the role.

For the first time, Fletcher addressed Amorim's criticisms of United's academy.

Aside from the fact he did not start any academy-produced player in a Premier League game this season, Amorim did not show any sign he had faith in the players it had produced.

In addition, he angered United officials by singling out Harry Amass - whose loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday has now come to an end - and striker Chido Obi for criticism.

Amorim also said he detected a sense of entitlement among United's young players.

As someone who was himself developed by the club, has previously held the position of technical director and up to this week has been responsible for their under-18s players, Fletcher brought Kobbie Mainoo and Shea Lacey on at Turf Moor.

On only his second senior appearance, 18-year-old Lacey nearly won the game with a curling effort from 20 yards that came back off the crossbar.

"Historically, this club is built around the academy," said Fletcher. "Our record speaks for itself.

"We've got some amazing talent and what I see is a lot of hardworking, humble young players, honest and coachable, who aren't perfect because they're young and they're learning.

"We ask too much of young people in society at times. We have to let them learn - educate them, help them and understand they will make mistakes.

"With good guidance, all of us play a part in developing them to be Manchester United players. Hopefully they can showcase themselves like Shea did."

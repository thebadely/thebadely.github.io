Woltemade own goal gives Sunderland win over Newcastle

A different manager and an almost completely different team - but someone at Sunderland wasn't going to forget in a hurry.

Nearly two years ago, after Newcastle's thumping 3-0 win at the Stadium of Light in an FA Cup fourth-round tie, the Magpies celebrated with a full squad photograph on the pitch in front of their jubilant supporters.

This time it was the turn of the Black Cats.

Nick Woltemade's own goal was enough to give Sunderland a memorable win over their rivals in the first Premier League Tyne-Wear derby since 2016 - and the hosts celebrated at full-time by recreating Newcastle's snap shot.

When asked who suggested the idea, Black Cats manager Regis le Bris smiled and simply said: "Always unpredictable, creative, adaptive."

Defender Dan Ballard, who scored an own goal in that 2024 FA Cup tie, was the only Sunderland player to start in both games.

He revealed how he desperately wanted to avenge the loss, telling Sky Sports: "You cannot describe [the feeling]. It was so painful [losing to Newcastle] for the players and for the fans so we felt we had let them down so we're delighted with this win.

"It prepared us more for today. We came in with more quality in this team, real leaders, we stuck in there, fought really hard and I thought we deserved the win."

Seventh-placed Sunderland are enjoying a superb return to the top flight following promotion via the play-offs last season.

The Black Cats have 26 points in 16 games, their most at this stage of a Premier League campaign since 2000-01 (also 26), when they went on to finish seventh.

They are yet to lose in the league at the Stadium Light, which had an electric atmosphere for most of Sunday afternoon.

"Derbies, you have to win, it does not matter how," said captain Granit Xhaka to Sky Sports.

"This team deserves much more - and more respect as where we are in the league is amazing and we're working really hard."

Sunderland are also unbeaten in their last 10 league games against Newcastle (seven wins and three draws), their longest such run against the Magpies.

Newcastle's last league win over Sunderland was back in August 2011.

Le Bris told Sky Sports he was "proud and happy" with the result.

"It was a derby and we were expected [to win] by our fans," he added. "This win is well deserved, we were mature and the lads were incredible.

"It's good for the region, the club, the fans. We knew before it was a special game, but we have to reset quickly as we have another tough challenge in Brighton in one week so let's go again."

Here’s what you need to know: President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied allegations by Russia that Ukraine launched a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, and accused Moscow of trying to derail peace talks. 

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Kyiv had launched an attack overnight using 91 long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Putin's state residence in Russia's northwestern Novgorod region.

Russia said it would now review its position in peace negotiations. It is not yet clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack.

Zelensky dismissed the claim as "typical Russian lies", intended to give the Kremlin an excuse to continue attacks on Ukraine. 

He said that Russia had previously targeted government buildings in Kyiv.

Zelensky added on X: "It is critical that the world doesn't stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace."

In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems.

He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack.

"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised," he said.

But he added that Russia did not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported.

The claim by Moscow comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war.

Following the meeting, Zelensky told Fox News on Monday that there was a "possibility to finish this war" in 2026.

But he said Ukraine could not win the war without US support.

"My feelings of President Trump's sanctions and economical steps, shows that he's ready for very strong steps," Zelensky said. "In this situation, the United States can move the situation to peace quicker."

The Ukrainian president told Fox News there was no indication that Putin wanted peace and that he did not trust Putin.

"I don't trust Putin and he doesn't want success for Ukraine," Zelensky added.

Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was "close to 95%" done.

Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full.

Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.

Russia has previously rejected key parts of the plan under discussion.

The White House said on Monday that President Trump had "concluded a positive call" with Putin, following the US-Ukraine talks. 

Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told reporters on Monday that during the call, Putin had pointed out the alleged attack on his residence happened "almost straight after what the US had considered to be a successful round of talks".

Ushakov said: "The US president was shocked by this information, he was angry and said he couldn't believe such mad actions. It was stated that this will no doubt affect the US approach to working with Zelensky".

During a later press conference, Trump initially appeared to say he did not know about the alleged incident, but later told reporters that he was told about it by Putin and was "very angry" about it. 

Asked if the US had seen any evidence supporting Russia's claim, he responded: "Well we'll find out. You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place - that's possible too, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did".

According to new developments, US President Donald Trump's attack on European countries at the UN is on most of the front pages. The Financial Times calls it a "tirade" while for the Daily Mirror it was a "deranged" rant. 

The Daily Telegraph notes that, a week after he carefully avoided criticising his British hosts on his state visit, Trump said nations were "going to hell" because of illegal migration. 

The Guardian says he also launched "a full-on assault" on the UN, questioning its very purpose. 

The Times highlights his comments that Nato countries should shoot down Russian jets which enter their airspace in words which "raise the stakes for future incursions".

The Daily Mail focuses on the row surrounding Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. It says a leaked email from 2021 is a "bombshell" which deepens a "crisis" around the handling of donations to the think tank he used to run. The Conservatives are calling for an investigation, saying Mr McSweeney has been caught "red-handed". He has not commented. Downing Street says all support for Sir Keir's leadership campaign was properly declared.

Another big pharmaceutical firm puts pressure on the government in the Financial Times. The boss of the American giant Eli Lilly tells the paper the UK is "probably the worst country in Europe" for drug prices and says Britain will miss out on new products unless it changes its policies. Eli Lilly, Merck and AstraZeneca have said they plan to pause or scrap investments in the UK because talks about pricing have made no progress.

Cricket umpire Dickie Bird is described as a "national treasure" by the Daily Express and a "legend" by the Daily Star after his death at the age of 92. 

The Telegraph says Dickie Bird's "enjoyment of his own good fortune was infectious" and says that his modest record as a county cricketer made him "all the more aware of his privilege in consorting with the greats of the game". 

The Guardian says he was one of the most proficient and eccentric sporting figures of his generation, loved by the public for what they sensed was an essential humanity.

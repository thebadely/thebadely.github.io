It has been recently reported that Many of the papers take aim at the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over claims she was told by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) there was no black hole in the public finances well before she unveiled her Budget.

The Times describes it as a budget "of smoke and mirrors" as it focuses on what it calls "crippling" tax rises in the hospitality sector.

With the headline "'Liar' Reeves must go", the Daily Mail tells its readers the chancellor kept the secret in order to hike taxes.

"Chancer of the Exchequer" is how the Sun frames the story, while the Daily Telegraph suggests she is fighting for her job with the headline: "Reeves on the brink over tax lies."

The Financial Times says the chancellor has been accused of "exaggerating gloom", but reports that Downing Street has denied she misled the public or MPs.

On its front page, the Guardian carries an interview with Rachel Reeves in which she defends her handling of the Budget. She says she made "fair and necessary choices".

The Times reveals that Prince Edward pays a peppercorn rent for the 120-room Surrey mansion he has leased from the Crown Estate for 25 years. The newspaper forced the disclosure of documents which it says shows the King's brother paid £5m for a 150-year lease but pays a nominal amount to stay there. The Crown Estate and Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

Billed as a world exclusive investigation, the Daily Mail carries the story of the man who claims he is the real Mo Farah. The newspaper describes the complicated tale that led up to a "sliding doors" moment when the Olympian Sir Mo Farah, whose real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, was taken to Britain from war-torn Somalia when he was a young child on a visa meant for the real Mohamed Farah who was left behind.

The Guardian highlights the dangers of methanol poisoning for young people travelling abroad which it describes as a "hidden crisis" which has left a "trail of trauma". The newspaper features the account of Bethany Clarke who survived drinking the same contaminated shots which killed her friend Simone White while the pair were staying in Laos last year.

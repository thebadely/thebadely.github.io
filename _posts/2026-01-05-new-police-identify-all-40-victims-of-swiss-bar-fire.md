Let's dive into the details: The bodies of the 40 victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve have been identified by police.

The victims range in age from 14 to 39 years old, with 15 aged under 18. The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.

In addition to the 40 killed, 119 others were injured. Most have severe burns - six of them so severe that they have yet to be identified. 

A criminal investigation into the French couple who managed Le Constellation bar is under way. 

Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.

Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.

However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce her is 16-year-old son, Arthur, was one of the dead. 

"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light," she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message. He "has left to party in paradise", she said.

While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been "living a nightmare".

Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. "There are no words - they went through hell."

Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.

The French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.

Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was "the cause of the problem", as well as "whether it complies with regulations".

A teenager who went to two schools in the UK has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in the fire. 

Charlotte Niddam, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London, according to reports.

In a post on social media, the teenager's family announced her death "with great sadness" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.

Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the "young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values".

His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.

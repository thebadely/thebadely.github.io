Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Great Britain's Aled Sion Davies has three Paralympic gold medals

Great Britain's Aled Sion Davies secured his seventh consecutive F63 shot put title on the final day of the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi.

The Welshman, 34, threw a distance of 16.44m in his fifth attempt to finish ahead of Kuwait's Faisal Sorour, who won silver with an effort of 16.28m, and clinch the 11th world title of his career. 

Brazil's Edenilson Floriani took bronze with a throw of 14.07m.

"It's quite surreal to be honest," Davies told BBC Sport.

"Faisal is coming along and he has been pushing me. But I haven't been able to respond to him in the last few years. It feels good to be back but I still feel there's so much more to come." 

Davies had missed out on gold at a fourth consecutive Paralympics last year as Sorour threw 15.31m to win in Paris. 

F63 is a classification for athletes with a single leg amputation above the knee who use a prosthesis.

In recent years, Davies has been hampered by a condition called osteitis pubis, which causes pain and swelling in the groin and has needed surgery, but has vowed to break his own world record at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles. 

"After last year's heartbreak, the pain of the last four or five years with my injuries, and finally accepting that I needed to have a few repairs," Davies said. 

"I had to have a reconstruction of my hip and I was told I might not come back to the standards I was at.

"I've done that. I've come back, rebuilt in the silence and I've come here and competed again.

"I'm building towards LA. I'm going to break my world record."

Meanwhile, Britain's Victoria Levitt won silver in the T44 200m, the Englishwoman clocking a personal best of 27.46secs as the United States' Annie Carey won gold in 27.31secs.

Levitt's team-mate Bebe Jackson finished third but was not awarded bronze as the final was competed by only three athletes - with four being the requirement for  one.

Great Britain finish the championships seventh in the medal table with seven golds, five silvers and 13 bronzes.

"It has been a positive experience," said Katie Jones, head of Paralympic performance at UK Athletics. 

"The athletes have all come together, the team spirit has been fantastic and we have come away with 25 medals. We couldn't have asked for more than that.

"We are at the start of the LA cycle. We have had lots of athletes within the top eight, top four and within medals here. 

"Moving on to the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the European Championships will give us the chance to allow new athletes to come in and embed what they have achieved here."

According to new developments, Graham Potter has a home in Sweden after previously enjoying success with Ostersunds FK

Former West Ham manager Graham Potter is in talks to become Sweden's next head coach. 

The 50-year-old expressed his love for the country and interest in the post earlier this week and BBC Sport understands discussions over Potter taking the role are moving quickly. 

Sweden sacked Jon Dahl Tomasson on Tuesday following a poor start to the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign that has left them sitting bottom of Group B with just one point from four games.

Potter, who was dismissed by the Hammers in September after only eight months at the helm, previously enjoyed a successful spell in Sweden as boss of Ostersunds FK from 2011 until 2018.

The Englishman led them from the fourth tier of Swedish football to its top division, and also helped them win the Swedish Cup in 2017.

Potter then managed Swansea City and Brighton before joining Chelsea in 2022, but was sacked from his role at Stamford Bridge after seven months.

Former Denmark striker and Blackburn Rovers boss Tomasson was fired from his Sweden post after a 1-0 defeat at home to Kosovo in Monday's World Cup qualifier.

Despite a stellar forward line of Liverpool's Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres of Arsenal, the Swedes drew with Slovenia and lost to both Switzerland and Kosovo in their opening three group games.

But, having won their Uefa Nations League group, they are still on course for a play-off spot to give them another chance of reaching next summer's World Cup in North America.

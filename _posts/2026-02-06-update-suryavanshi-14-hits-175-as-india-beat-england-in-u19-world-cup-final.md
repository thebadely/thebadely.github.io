Scorecard

India overpowered England in the final of the Under-19 World Cup, with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi starring with a stunning 175 from just 80 balls.

The IPL sensation hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike-rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.

He scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.

Suryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.

Lumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.

A number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.

India finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final, eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.

England struggled to keep pace with India when their turn came to bat. Knowing they needed to maintain a run-rate of 8.24 from the outset, a second-wicket partnership between Ben Dawkins and Ben Mayes gave them hope.

Mayes (45 off 28 balls), who finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, looked in particularly good touch but he was out playing a reverse sweep and despite skipper Rew adding a punchy 31 off 18, wickets began to fall regularly.

At one stage, England lost four wickets for three runs to slide to 177-7.

Middlesex's Caleb Falconer played a brilliant knock to give his side the smallest of hope - bringing up his century off 63 balls when he moved across his stumps and clipped the ball over the square leg fence for six.

He was running out of partners, however, and was the last wicket to fall when he was caught at backward point for 115.

India have now won the tournament a record six times, with England's last success as this level coming in 1998.

Suryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71, second only to Mayes (444 at 74).

Some other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings: 

It was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.

The innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.

It was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.

His knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.

His 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.

The century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament

It is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.

He then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.

It was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.

In July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.

He took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.

Four months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.

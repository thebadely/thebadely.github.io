Here’s what you need to know: Early years teachers in England will be offered tax-free payments of £4,500 to work in nurseries in disadvantaged areas as part of government efforts to boost standards.

The incentives are designed to attract and retain fully qualified staff in 20 areas, the education department said on Monday without confirming exactly which places would benefit. 

The scheme is part of a wider strategy designed to narrow the attainment gap among pre-school children due to be unveiled on Monday.

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the plans would "help give our youngest children the very best start in life" - but the Conservatives said Labour's tax changes had hit nurseries hard.

The government said it would spend £1.5 billion on its so-called Best Start in Life strategy, which builds on Labour's campaign pledge to reform services for the youngest children in order to drive up education and health standards.

The education department said only one in 10 nurseries currently have a specialist early years teacher.

The direct payments to trained teachers are intended to incentivise staff to work in areas with the most acute needs.

Payments will begin next year, though no details about the eligibility criteria have been published.

Also included in the package of reforms is a proposal to increase the number of Ofsted inspection nurseries undergo, including ensuring all new providers are assessed within 18 months.

Announcing the plans, Phillipson said "the best way of reducing inequalities is by tackling them early".

On Sunday, the government also said it would fund new local hubs to offer youth services and support for parents, which are modelled on the Sure Start centres set up under the New Labour government and largely closed after 2010.

Neil Leith of the Early Years Alliance said the early years announcement was a "positive development" but warned the strategy would only work "if it is backed up with the tangible support - financial or otherwise".

Shadow education minister Neil O'Brien said that an increase in employers' National Insurance contributions had left nurseries across the country "on the brink".

Some have had to "hike fees or shut their doors", he said, adding: "Families are being left to face higher childcare costs and fewer places."

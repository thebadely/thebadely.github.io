Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by a strike by French air traffic control staff, meaning cancelled flights in France have had a knock-on effect elsewhere in Europe, including the UK.

What are your rights if your journey has been disrupted and can you get your money back?

When flights are delayed or cancelled, airlines have a duty to look after you.

That includes providing meals and accommodation, if necessary, and getting you to your destination. The airline should organise putting you on an alternative flight, at no extra cost.

Additional losses - such as unused accommodation - might require a claim to a credit card provider, if that was the payment option used.

After that, a claim may need to go to your travel insurance provider. But there is no standard definition of what is covered.

While 94% of policies cover travel abandonment as standard, only 30% include wider travel disruption as standard, according to analysts Defaqto.

If your flight is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight.

That's regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made.

You can get your money back for any part of the ticket you have not used.

So, if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded.

If you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight.

If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport, then you have a right to be booked on to that alternative transport instead.

If your flight was coming into the UK on a non-UK airline, then you should check the terms and conditions of your booking.

Disruption caused by things like a fire, bad weather, strikes by airport or air traffic control staff, or other "extraordinary circumstances" does not entitle you to extra compensation.

However, in other circumstances - when it is considered to be the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law.

These apply as long as you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline.

What you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you are given.

If your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered.

The amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling:

If you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance.

This includes:

If your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later.

The Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary.

You are entitled to the same assistance as for a cancellation if your flight is delayed by more than two hours for a short-haul flight, three hours for a medium-haul, or four hours for a long-haul.

If you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.

If you booked a package holiday with a company that is an ABTA member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund.

Airlines will not refund you for loss of earnings.

Travel insurance policies will not usually cover loss of earnings either.

If you think you're going to be late back at work because of flight delays, you have a responsibility to let your employer know, legal experts say.

You should agree with your employer how to deal with the absence - for example, by using annual leave or taking unpaid leave.

Employers have no legal obligation to pay employees who are absent in this situation, experts say, unless it is stated in their contract.

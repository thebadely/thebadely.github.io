Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Rolene Streutker helped Nottingham Forest move into the Super League top four with four matches remaining

Nottingham Forest moved into the Netball Super League top four and boosted their play-off hopes with an emphatic 77-53 victory over bottom side Cardiff Dragons.

Forest racked up the points at House of Sport in the Welsh capital, including 20 in the final quarter to boost their goal difference.

Victory takes Chelsea Pitman's side up to fourth in the table, ahead of the weekend's other Super League fixtures on Sunday.

Forest goal shooter Rolene Streutker enjoyed a fruitful night as she extended her lead at the top of the super shot scoreboard. The South African has now recorded 110 in this campaign.

And the result provides a boost as Pitman's team prepare to face London Mavericks - who they moved above in the table - next weekend in a potentially pivotal match for deciding play-off places.

Cardiff, meanwhile, were unable to build on earning their first win of the season last weekend and remain rock bottom with just four points from nine games.

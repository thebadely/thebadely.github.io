It has been recently reported that Parents and pupils will be able to get free school essentials and clothing to help families save money in time for the new school year.

Queensgate Shopping Centre in Peterborough will hold the Free School Uniform Event on 1 August. 

it will include primary and secondary school clothes which can be exchanged on the day near the centre's Superdry store. 

"Hopefully this can be an event that helps cut down on their costs in time for September, while also benefitting the environment at the same time," said Katy Cole, Labour and cabinet member for children's services at Peterborough City Council.

She added: "Working in education and being a parent myself I am well aware of the cost of uniforms and how quickly youngsters grow out of them."

The council said the event would include recycling games, upcycling and crafts between 11:00 BST and 16:00. 

It was organised by the city council's recycling education team and Peterborough Youth Council, with support from Peterborough Family Hubs.

Danielle Daboh, the city's Youth MP, said: "The event is championing reusing school uniform and also helping to alleviate the stress for families during the back-to-school period.

"It's also about signposting the environmental effects and economic benefits of events such as these, and hopefully we can do more in the future."

The National Literacy Trust is set to attend the event alongside the Goal2Grow initiative, where fans can exchange pre-loved football shirts.

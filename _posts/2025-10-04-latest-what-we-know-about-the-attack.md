Let's dive into the details: Two Jewish people were killed and three left in a serious condition after a car ramming and stabbing attack outside a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday.

The victims have been named as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. One of the victims was hit by police gunfire "as a tragic and unforeseen consequence" as officers shot the attacker, Greater Manchester Police said.

The suspect, who was shot dead at the scene, has been named as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent.

The attack occurred during worship at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar, and is being treated by police as a terror incident.

Here is what we know so far about the attack.

Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbed at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09:31 BST on Thursday.

Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09:38.

A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time, and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe.

Worshippers and security staff demonstrated "immediate bravery" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building, Greater Manchester Police said.

In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man "acting suspiciously" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. 

The police said it do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later "the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack".

Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle "just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public".

She then saw a man "jump out" and start running towards the people "with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage", she said, calling the scene "traumatising" .

Gareth Tonge, another eyewitness who was driving his delivery van near the scene, told the BBC he saw a man "bleeding out on the floor".

"Then as we looked over the guy had a knife and he was just stabbing the window, trying to get in [the building]," he said.

Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing "a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue".

He told the BBC the attacker was "body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.

Outside, Mr Tonge said once police arrived, "they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire," adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.

The man then "started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again", Mr Tonge added - describing it as "nerve-racking" to witness.

Rabbi Walker said at some point after the police arrived two others were hurt inside the foyer.

"If one particular gentleman hadn't acted as quickly as he did and got the doors locked I can't imagine what would have happened," he said.

A bomb disposal unit was deployed after "suspicious items" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was "fake".

An SAS helicopter, dubbed "Blue Thunder", was seen flying above the area later. The aircraft, and the troops it carries, are part of a national airborne counter-terrorism response. The attack was later declared a terrorist incident.

The two Jewish men killed in the attack were named as 66-year-old Melvin Cravitz and 53-year-old Adrian Daulby.

Both were from Crumpsall, where the synagogue is located, police said.

A statement from Greater Manchester Police named the man who died after police fired gunshots while attempting to target the attacker as Mr Daulby. He had been helping to hold the doors of the synagogue shut to prevent the attacker entering, police said.

Mr Daulby's family paid tribute to their "hero" who died during "the act of courage to save others".

"The family is shocked by the tragic, sudden death of such a lovely down to earth man", the tribute added.

Mr Cravitz was a worshipper at the synagogue when the attack happened. Greater Manchester Police originally said he was a security guard but later issued a clarification.

His family described him as a "kind, caring" man who was devoted to his wife and family.

"He will be sorely missed", they said.

Police said it had been advised by medical professionals that one of three victims being treated in hospital also suffered a gunshot wound. 

The BBC has been told this victim was Yoni Finlay, who was one of the other people holding the doors of the synagogue closed.

He is currently under armed guard in hospital, has had surgery and was awake and speaking on Thursday evening.

Two others sustained "serious injuries" during the attack, with one suffering a stab wound, while the other was struck by the suspect's car, police said. Their identities have not been made public.

Police have named the man who carried out the attack as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwich, Manchester.

It is understood he entered the UK as a very young child, and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.

Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie "may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology". 

But it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.

His family said in a statement: "We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened.

"Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort."

The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records.

But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including "a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed".

A police source told the BBC Al-Shamie was on police bail for an alleged rape when he carried out the attack.

Greater Manchester Police said six other suspects have been arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. 

Police initially said they had arrested two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s. It later said one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s, had also been arrested. 

A women aged 18 and a 43 year-old man were released on 4 October with no further action, police said.

An image of the attacker, verified by the BBC, was taken from just outside the perimeter fence of the scene on Thursday morning.

The man's appearance matches that of a man seen being shot by police at the same location in verified video from the scene of the attack.

A photo from the scene shows the body of the attacker being examined by a bomb disposal technician.

Heaton Park Synagogue said Thursday's attack had "changed us all forever".

"Two of our beloved members were murdered in cold blood, and others remain in hospital with serious injuries. The loss we feel is beyond words," a statement released on Friday by Rabbi Walker, the executive and trustees of the synagogue said.

"These were not simply members of our synagogue - they were our friends, our family - and their absence leaves a void that can never be filled."

In a separate interview with the BBC, Rabbi Walker said: "I believe very strongly that we can't allow this to beat us."

Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the incident was "the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come".

The attack was the "tragic result" of an "unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, campuses, on social media and elsewhere", he said in a statement shared with the BBC.

In the attack's immediate aftermath, religious leaders and political figures across the world condemned the attack.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who flew back early from Denmark to chair a Cobra meeting, vowed to do "everything" in his power to protect Jewish people in the wake of the attack, "starting with a more visible police presence".

Addressing the Jewish community in a recorded message, the prime minister said: "I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do... Nobody should have to do that. Nobody."

Imam Qari Asim, co-chairman of the British Muslim Network, said the scenes in Manchester "had no place in our society", adding:  "The bloodshed and violence in the Middle East - which is excruciatingly painful to witness for all of us - must not be allowed to poison our streets in Britain".

The newly named Archbishop of Canterbury called on the Church to stand with the Jewish community, saying hatred and racism "cannot be allowed to tear us apart".

King Charles III said he and the Queen were "deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community".

Yom Kippur is the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.

It is a solemn time of fasting and atonement thought to be the day God seals the fate of each person for the coming year. Work is forbidden as the day is set aside for prayer and reflection.

Many who do not regularly attend synagogue services often do so on this day.

Sir Keir said "additional police assets" would be deployed at synagogues across the country after the attack.

He said in a statement: "The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific."

"We will do everything to keep our Jewish community safe."

Experts revealed that Brooks Koepka is a five-time major champion

Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka has left LIV Golf to prioritise "the needs of his family".

The 35-year-old American controversially quit the PGA Tour to join the Saudi Arabian-backed series in 2022 and won five events over four seasons.

"Family has always guided Brooks' decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend more time at home," read a statement from his representatives on Tuesday. "Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf."

Koepka reportedly had one year remaining on his contract, but LIV Golf chief executive Scott O'Neil said his departure had been "amicably and mutually agreed". 

"We appreciate the significant impact he has had on the game and wish him continued success, both on and off the course," added O'Neil.

Florida-born Koepka, who is married and has a young son, turned professional in 2012 and won nine PGA Tour events during his nine seasons on North America's elite professional circuit.

The PGA Tour also wished Koepka and "his family continued success" in a statement, before adding they "continue to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness".

A three-time US PGA champion, Koepka, has also twice triumphed at the US Open. 

His defection from the PGA Tour, along with big names such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau, was seen as a major coup for LIV during a period when the sport appeared to be at civil war.

Koepka's captaincy of the LIV Golf team, Smash, will now pass to Talor Gooch, with the side having an opening to fill for the start of the 2026 season in February. 

Koepka becomes the first star player to leave LIV Golf, however, there has been speculation over his future for months and a possible return to the PGA Tour.

The Tour has suspended players who competed in LIV Golf events after categorising them as unauthorised. Non-members have been subject to a year ban following their previous LIV event.

Koepka will also be eligible to join the DP World Tour and have exemptions to compete in golf's four major championships.

Earlier this week, Chilean Mito Pereira announced his retirement from golf aged 30 after three seasons with LIV.

Koepka's departure is a significant development, the first major-winning player to walk away from the lucrative breakaway league.

The five-time major champion has suffered a dramatic loss of form since winning the 2023 US PGA Championship. His relationship with LIV always seemed lukewarm, rarely hyping the Saudi Arabia-backed venture in the fashion of so many of its other recruits.

What happens next will be fascinating. As it stands he will not be eligible to play on the PGA Tour until August, which will be a year after his last LIV appearance.

But could rules be changed for one of the game's biggest names? That would be a highly controversial move.

An alternative route could be via the Europe-based DP World Tour, with which the US player has always shared a strong affinity.

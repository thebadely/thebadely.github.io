Experts revealed that Steven Fletcher won 33 Scotland caps

Steven Fletcher has announced his retirement from football at the age of 38.

The forward, who made 33 appearances for Scotland, was most recently at Wrexham, helping them secure back-to-back promotions to the Championship.

Fletcher started his career at Hibernian and was linked with a return to Easter Road this summer.

He moved south to Burnley in 2009 and also turned out for Wolves, Sunderland, Marseille, Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City before returning to Scotland with Dundee United in 2022 then joining Wrexham.

He made 749 club appearances, scoring 189 goals. Internationally, he found the net 10 times at senior level.

Fletcher said "every club has shaped me and given me memories I'll never forget".

"It's not an easy decision because this game has been my life since I was a boy, but I know in my heart it's the right moment to close this chapter," he explained on Instagram.

"When I look back, I feel nothing but pride and gratitude. I want to thank all the fans who supported me along the way, your passion and backing meant the world.

"Pulling on the Scotland shirt was also one of the greatest honours of my career.

"To represent my country and share the pitch with so many talented lads is something I'll always treasure. Those moments stay with you forever."

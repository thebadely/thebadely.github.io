Experts revealed that Machado Garry's win against Prates was the 16th of his career

Ian Machado Garry survived a late blitz from Carlos Prates to triumph by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night in Kansas City, Missouri.

After controlling the majority of the fight, Ireland's Machado Garry was hurt by some ground shots from the Brazilian but held on to the final bell in a tense finish.

It was a welcome victory for Machado Garry after his defeat by Shavkat Rakhmonov in December while it was Prates' first loss in the UFC.

"I wasn't hurt enough to not know where I was, I was conscious in every moment. I know how dangerous that man is, I have nothing but respect for him," said Machado Garry. 

"That man hits like a truck. He's been on a tear but I told everyone what I was going to do - outclass him - and I believe I did that."

The 27-year-old, as he did against Rakhmonov, took the Prates fight at the start of the month at short notice.

Machado Garry was seeking to bounce back from the first defeat of his nine-fight UFC career and had targeted outclassing the 31-year-old over five rounds - and that is largely what he did.

Machado Garry received boos during his walkout in contrast to the popular Prates, who has become a fan favourite with four knockouts in his first four bouts. 

After a tentative opening few minutes, Machado Garry took advantage of a slip from Prates as he opened up a cut below his left eye with a heavy punch to the grounded Brazilian.

The Irishman started to use his range effectively, landing punch combinations as he out-struck Prates and took control in the second round.

A blitz of uppercuts stunned Prates in the third, who was struggling to stifle Machado Garry's movement and land any telling shots.

But with the fight heading into the latter stages, Prates came alive, pressuring Machado Garry to find a home for a big left and flying knee.

With minutes remaining, Prates reversed a takedown from Machado Garry before landing some big shots on the ground.

The crowd roared on the action at T-Mobile Centre hoping for a finish, but Machado Garry survived until the end of the fight to secure the win on the judges' scorecards.

In his post-fight interview, Machado Garry revealed he is the back-up fighter for the welterweight title fight between champion Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena at UFC 315 on 10 May.

"My entire goal is to prove I'm one of the most game fighters who has ever existed. I've got the fighting Irish in my blood and this is what's next for me," he added.

Here’s what you need to know: Carlo Ancelotti receives the Brazilian national team shirt from Samir Xaud, the president of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF)

New Brazil coach Carlo Ancelotti said he is "honoured and proud to lead the best team in the world" and targeted winning the 2026 World Cup.

The 65-year-old was unveiled as Brazil boss in a news conference at the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) headquarters.

The Italian joins the Selecao having been Real Madrid manager for the past four years. He has won the Champions League on three occasions and the La Liga title twice over two spells in charge.

Ancelotti also guided AC Milan to become European champions twice, won the Premier League and FA Cup with Chelsea as well as the French and German domestic titles with Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich respectively.

"I have a big job ahead of me," he said. "I'm delighted, the challenge is great. I've always had a special connection with this team. We're going to work to make Brazil champions again.

"I'm honoured and proud to lead the best team in the world."

Brazil have won the World Cup five times, with the most recent triumph in 2002, and Ancelotti's first games with them are two South American World Cup qualifiers.

They play against Ecuador away on 5 June before a home game against Paraguay in Sao Paulo five days later.

Ancelotti was welcomed by former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and has replaced Dorival Junior, who was sacked at the end of March following a 4â1 defeat by Argentina, a humiliating loss that was the latest in a series of poor results.

Brazil are fourth in South American World Cup qualifying with four matches to go, with the top six teams earning direct qualification to the competition in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The team's struggles began more than two years ago when they were knocked out of the 2022 World Cup by Croatia on penalties in the quarter-finals. They have since lost five of their past 14 games, conceding 16 goals.

Casemiro has played 75 times for Brazil

Ancelotti has selected Manchester United midfielder Casemiro and Tottenham forward Richarlison in his first squad for next week's World Cup qualifiers.

The pair have not played for their country since a 2-0 loss to Uruguay in October 2023.

The 25-man group also includes Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson, Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira, Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli and Wolves' Matheus Cunha, who is set to move to Manchester United.

Antony, on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United, is expected to play in the Conference League final for the Spanish side against Chelsea on Wednesday and he has also been picked.

Striker Neymar has been ruled out as he recovers from a thigh injury he sustained in April, although he made a substitute appearance for Santos on Sunday in their 1-0 win over Vitoria in Brazil's Serie A.

Goalkeepers: Alisson (Liverpool), Bento (Al-Nassr), Hugo Souza (Corinthians).

Defenders: Alex Sandro, Danilo, Leo Ortiz, Wesley (all Flamengo), Alexsandro (Lille), Lucas Beraldo, Marquinhos (both Paris St-Germain), Carlos Augusto (Inter Milan), Vanderson (Monaco).

Midfielders: Andreas Pereira (Fulham), Andrey Santos (Strasbourg), Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle), Casemiro (Manchester United), Ederson (Atalanta), Gerson (Flamengo).

Forwards: Antony (Real Betis), Estevao (Palmeiras), Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal), Matheus Cunha (Wolves), Raphinha (Barcelona), Richarlison (Tottenham), Vinicius Jr (Real Madrid).

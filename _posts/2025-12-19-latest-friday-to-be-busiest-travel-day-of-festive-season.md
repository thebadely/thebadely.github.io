Here’s what you need to know: Britain's roads, railways and airports are set to be thronged by festive travellers on what is is anticipated to be the busiest day for Christmas trips.

The AA has warned of gridlock on Friday as 24.4 million cars are expected to hit the roads.

It is also expected to be the busiest day of the Christmas period for airports, with 460,000 journeys planned.

Network Rail has also advised travellers to check their journeys and book a seat if possible.

The AA said this Christmas could be the busiest on record for UK roads, and advised drivers to allow extra time to complete their journeys.

The insurance company said most people driving during the festive period travelled less than 100 miles, meaning congestion is likely around motorway interchanges and retail destinations.

AA patrol expert Shaun Jones said patience behind the wheel "will be your best present this year".

"Plan ahead, check your route, and allow extra time," he said.

Network Rail also encouraged passengers to allow extra time for train travel. Improvement works taking place over the Christmas period mean several routes will be closed or restricted.

Information on what routes will be closed for repairs can be found on the Network Rail website.

National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.

Daniel Mann, Director of Industry Operations at the Rail Delivery Group, said: "We encourage customers to reserve seats where possible, bring only luggage that is easy to carry and fits in designated storage areas, and allow extra time for their journeys."

Friday is expected to be the busiest day of the festive season for airports, but the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said flying on Christmas Day was becoming more popular.

It advised customers to know their rights in case their flight is cancelled or delayed.

If this happens, airlines are required to support passengers. This can include:

If your flight is cancelled, and it is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight.

You can check if your flight is covered under UK law here.

The CAA also said that travellers can minimise their risk of delays by ensuring their cases are packed correctly.

This includes leaving presents unwrapped as they may need to be inspected.

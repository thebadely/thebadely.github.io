Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Dark before tea time, pumpkins in the windows, the distant rumble of fireworks... for many this is the best week of the year - because it means it is time for the FA Cup first round.

While it is statistically unlikely that any of the 80 clubs in action this weekend will remain standing in the world's oldest knockout competition by the time the action moves under the Wembley arch next April, the chances are not zero.

However your league season may have started, it is time to dream big.

We have former winners locking horns, local rivalries renewed after many years, eighth-tier tiddlers hoping to make a splash against some big fish and some real 'X-factor' too.

Find out all the fixtures and read on for five things to look out for in the FA Cup this weekend.

It's what it's all about...

The lowest-ranked club still involved in the competition are Essex side Maldon & Tiptree, who sit top of the eighth-tier Isthmian League Division One North.

The Jammers earned their sixth FA Cup victory of the campaign as they overcame Flackwell Heath 1-0 in the final qualifying round - that's already as many wins as a Premier League team would need to lift the trophy - having entered in the extra preliminary round on 1 August.

Former West Ham forward Freddie Sears headed the only goal of the game while ex-Charlton, Queens Park Rangers and Ipswich striker Macauley Bonne is also in the ambitious club's ranks and they are managed by ex-Manchester City, Ipswich and Northern Ireland midfielder Kevin Horlock.

After checking a map for Burslem, the Jammers will travel to League One side Port Vale, five levels above them, on Sunday afternoon (15:00 GMT).

The minnows may find solace in the fact Vale are one of only two third-tier sides to have lost to a team from the eighth level in FA Cup history, losing 1-0 at Chasetown in a replay in December 2007 after a 1-1 draw at Vale Park.

There are 32 non-league teams still standing at this stage, and three of them are from the seventh tier.

Isthmian League Premier Division outfit Chatham Town, who are appearing at this stage of the competition for the first time in 97 years, visit National League North side Buxton.

Also at 15:00 on Saturday the Chats' divisional rivals St Albans City have an away trip to League One Burton Albion, four tiers above them, while on Sunday (17:15 GMT) Northern Premier Division club Gainsborough Trinity - conquerors of Hartlepool in the last round - will seek to spring another shock in front of the cameras against League Two side Accrington Stanley.

At least one sixth-tier side will be in the hat for round two and history will be made as neither Macclesfield FC or AFC Totton, who meet on Saturday afternoon, have made it that far before.

Nine of the 80 sides in the first round have previously lifted the trophy.

On Saturday (15:00 GMT), four-time winners Bolton host 1922 winners Huddersfield, with Wanderers having beaten the Terriers on the path to two of those previous triumphs in 1923 and 1929... could 2026 be their year?

Cardiff, 1927 winners, head to League One rivals Peterborough at the same time while 1953 winners Blackpool are at home to National League high-fliers Scunthorpe.

Wigan Athletic - the most recent winners of any team in this year's first round, having triumphed in 2013 - welcome National League South side Hemel Hempstead Town, who toppled Yeovil in the previous round and have reached this stage for just the third time in 105 attempts.

Bradford, the 1911 champions, are on the road at League Two Cheltenham while AFC Wimbledon - yes, we are giving them the 1988 cup - welcome National League outfit Gateshead to Plough Lane.

Barnsley, winners in 1912, host Yorkshire rivals and 1955 semi-finalists York City of the National League, while Notts County - more on them shortly - visit Brackley Town.

Forest Green Rovers boss Robbie Savage never won the FA Cup as a player, but might he as a manager?

The FA Cup first round action begins on Friday evening (19:30 GMT) with National League side Forest Green Rovers, managed by Robbie Savage, travelling to League One Luton, now led by Jack Wilshere.

Saturday's early kick-off (12:00 GMT) is an all-Essex affair as National League South Chelmsford host Braintree, 11 miles up the road and struggling in the division above.

There will also be two ties screened live on BBC2 and the BBC Sport website involving National League sides hosting League Two clubs.

Brackley Town v Notts County, winners in 1894, is on Saturday (17:30 GMT), and Eastleigh host Walsall at 14:15 GMT on Sunday, shortly after National League North side South Shields welcome League Two Shrewsbury Town (12:00 GMT).

Another National League North side, Spennymoor Town, host League Two Barrow in a non-televised match on Saturday afternoon.

The final fixture of the round is on Monday night (19:30 GMT) as last year's fairytale team, National League club Tamworth, who took Tottenham to extra-time at The Lamb last January, welcome Leyton Orient, beaten in the League One play-off final in May.

FC Halifax of the National League will entertain League One Exeter on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

Yes, the potential for a 'cupset' is always intriguing, but trivia fans might be interested to know in the 144 years of the FA Cup this will be just the 46th tie between teams featuring the letter X in their name.

Oxford United, Wrexham and maybe even Crewe Alexandra might be waiting in the hat for round two, so, who knows, this might even be the start of a golden 'X' age.

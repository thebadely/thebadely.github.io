Let's dive into the details: The UK could bask in 30C heat and sunshine this bank holiday Monday, before blustery winds and rain arrive.

The Midlands is set to see the highest temperature, while Wales may be in store for its hottest late August bank holiday on record.

It comes after the Met Office said last week that, even though the summer is yet to be over, it was already on track to be among the country's hottest on record, with four heatwaves declared in the UK.

The warm weather will be short-lived, though, as overnight into Tuesday the remnants of Hurricane Erin are predicted to bring more wet and windy conditions initially to Northern Ireland and then across most of the UK.

Dry but cloudy conditions are expected for southern England over the bank holiday, where temperatures are set to peak at 26C, while the best blue skies will be seen in the Midlands.

The two million people expected to attend Notting Hill Carnival in west London on Sunday and Monday can therefore expect plenty of warm weather, as can those attending Reading and Leeds, Creamfields in Cheshire, and All Points East in the capital's Victoria Park this weekend.

Meanwhile, parts of eastern Wales could experience 27C on Monday - threatening to best the current late August bank holiday record for the nation of 26.5C, recorded at Crossway in 1991.

Hurricane Erin - which skirted the Caribbean and east coast of the US this week - has helped push warm, tropical air towards the UK, but will also help end that when the remnants of the hurricane get closer.

From midweek onwards, things turn more widely unsettled, with strong winds and some heavy, thundery downpours at times - though forecasts for the second half of the week remain uncertain.

The Met Office expects rain to persist throughout the rest of the week, though strong winds will stay offshore.

However, eastern areas of England could retain some warmth into Tuesday, with highs of 26C.

Those hoping to make the most of the warm weather while it lasts may have to grapple with travel delays and cancellations.

A strike on the CrossCountry network could make returning from Leeds festival tricky, while engineering works will mean no LNER trains in or out of London King's Cross.

Customers are being told not to travel on any CrossCountry routes, aside from those from Birmingham towards Penzance, Paignton, Bournemouth and Guildford.

The CrossCountry strike will continue on Monday, when there will be no trains between Birmingham, Reading and the south coast of England. There will also be no service between Leicester, Cambridge and Stansted Airport.

The RNLI also warned people planning a trip to the coast to use lifeguarded beaches and to beware of rough seas.

Prolonged dry periods throughout this summer have led to a significant shortfall of water in England, with hosepipe bans declared for millions - some of which are set to remain into the winter.

This means the UK is on course for one of its worst harvests on record, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a statutory research organisation.

While linking climate change with specific individual weather events can be difficult, scientists say that climate change is generally making bouts of hot weather longer, more intense and more frequent.

Four summer heatwaves in quick succession after an unusually warm spring suggests climate change is having some effect on 2025's weather.

It has been recently reported that Mirra Andreeva hired Conchita Martinez last season and has since reached a career-high ranking of sixth in the world

One is a chatty 18-year-old long tipped as a future Grand Slam champion.

The other is a straight-talking 53-year-old former Wimbledon winner, who has also coached another top player to the title.

Together, Mirra Andreeva and her coach Conchita Martinez are forming a successful double act which they hope will lead to the Russian teenager also lifting the SW19 title.

"Bringing in Conchita has definitely helped me improve," Andreeva, who plays American 10th seed Emma Navarro in the last 16 on Monday, told BBC Sport.

"It helps she is an ex-player and has been a Wimbledon champion. She shares a lot of her experience and advice with me."

Not only does Martinez know what world number seven Andreeva is going through, she's well aware what it takes to triumph at the All England Club.

"Mirra is a very special player and very complete in everything she does â but also improvable. I think she has a lot to learn," said Spaniard Martinez, who memorably won the 1994 title.

"If I won Wimbledon - I was more of a clay-court player - then I think she has a good shot of winning."

Sabalenka into Wimbledon quarter-finals

Coming into Wimbledon as the seventh seed, Andreeva has serenely moved through the draw while many top players have floundered. 

The anticipation, athleticism and tenacity of the teenager make her one of the best defenders on the grass, although the quality of her serve and attacking intent has also improved from previous appearances.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka is the only player left ranked higher than Andreeva, although five-time major champion Iga Swiatek also lurks in the opposite half.

"It took me many tries to get my game to be more comfortable on grass," Martinez, who is also a Wimbledon-winning coach having guided Garbine Muguruza to the 2017 title, told BBC Sport.

"But I think if Mirra does things with an open mind, and doesn't get angry when he misses, she has a game which she can win."

Since linking up, initially on a trial basis, the pair have formed a warm and natural bond.

Martinez has appeared to fulfil a few roles: coach, friend, tennis parent. Is that an accurate assessment?

"No, no, no," said Martinez, shaking her head.

"I'm her coach â that's the only way. Can you be friends? Yes. We have a great relationship. 

"But I'm the one there on the tennis court, changing things and making her improve. 

"I'm the one overseeing her whole career. I'm in charge of finding everything around her that will work to make her better player."

So far it is paying off.

Born in Siberia and trained in France, Andreeva has been touted as a future Grand Slam champion since making her breakthrough as a 15-year-old at the Madrid Open - where her talent and fearlessness caught the eye of Andy Murray.

Martinez says it was clear from the moment she started working with Andreeva last year that the teenager was a superstar in the making.

Her progress under Martinez has been notable.

This season she has already won two WTA 1000 titles - the tier of tournaments below the majors - in Dubai and Indian Wells, helping her climb to a career-high ranking of sixth in the world.

Despite the generational divide, the way Andreeva and Martinez bounce off each other is allowing the player to flourish.

Andreeva shows their mutual affection by teasing Martinez in her post-match interviews, or encouraging a crowd to sing 'Happy Birthday' to her coach., external

But from the conversations with both women it is clear that business comes first.

"The relationship is good, we get along great and she respects my work. For me, that is super important," said Martinez.

"If I have to be hard on the court or outside of the court I will be, but then we can also laugh. 

"We like to joke around, she is very playful and I think I am too â even though I am much older. The kid in me is brought out. 

"I think she also enjoys that because I'm not a serious figure. I can laugh and then we go back to work. 

"But if there is too much of the other and she starts not respecting me then that's the end of the relationship."

Teenage tantrums are frequent on the court for Andreeva, and some of her behaviour - notably swiping away balls towards the crowd - has come close to crossing the line.

The way she combusted against home wildcard Lois Boisson in a febrile French Open quarter-final last month was also a reminder of her tender years.

"Every match I have played there is always a moment where I let my emotions out. I feel it helps me," said Andreeva, who works on her mentality with a sports psychologist.

"But I think I can find a different way of letting them out. I don't know, maybe scream - but not throwing a racquet." 

Martinez does not want Andreeva to lose the fire in her belly, but says being overly negative will "not have a positive impact" on her game.

"You can get angry â it's not like you should always be perfect on the court," she said.

"But you have to be humble and accept when things are not perfect. If she is ready for that then she has a shot of doing really well."

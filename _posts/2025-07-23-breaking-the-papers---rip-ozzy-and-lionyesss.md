Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Many front pages feature tributes to Ozzy Osbourne. The Sun calls him "the wonderful wizard of Ozzy". The Daily Star quotes Sir Elton John, who remembers the Black Sabbath singer as a "trailblazer" and "rock god". In its obituary, the Daily Telegraph describes Ozzy Osbourne as "the quintessential wild man of heavy metal". To the Daily Mirror he was a "pioneer" whose crazy antics "kept us entertained for more than 50 years".

The Guardian focuses on the growing international condemnation of Israel over its operations in Gaza.  According to the paper, the UN has warned the "last lifelines keeping people alive" there are "collapsing". The Daily Express features a picture of a severely malnourished child, who it says is "clinging on to life" in Gaza. The headline says "for pity's sake stop this now".

The Daily Mail says the repatriation of Britons killed in last month's Air India crash has been "horrifically bungled". It says grieving relatives were told a coffin contained the body of an unknown person, rather than their family member. In another case the remains of more than one victim were placed in the same casket. The government says the formal identification of bodies is a matter for the Indian authorities.

The i Paper says ministers are considering allowing workers emergency access to their pensions in an effort to get people to save more. The paper says the details of any policy have not been signed off, including whether the accessible pot would have an upper limit.

The front page of the Times has a picture of the footballer Chloe Kelly celebrating the goal that secured England a place in the Euros final. Its back page calls the team's win during extra-time "the great escape", while the Daily Telegraph labels the Lionesses "the comeback queens". There's also high praise for the scorer of England's equaliser, Michelle Agyemang. The Mail says she "came to the rescue", while the Mirror calls her a "super- sub".

Experts revealed that A nurse has been struck off the register after filming people through a hole in a cubicle wall in an Asda toilet.

Pheddie Delos Reyes, who has been a registered nurse since 2019, was given a suspended prison sentence in June 2024 after being convicted of two counts of voyeurism and one count of making an indecent image of a child.

Wiltshire Police were called in July 2023 when a customer at the supermarket in Swindon reported being filmed while in the men's toilets. The force informed the Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, where Delos Reyes was working.

A Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) tribunal panel found that his fitness to practise had been impaired and struck him off.

The NMC tribunal was told that CCTV from Asda showed Delos Reyes arrived at the store at about 18:00 BST on 23 July 2023 and headed straight to the men's toilets, where he remained for nearly three hours.

The footage recorded about fifty males, including adults and children, going into the toilets over that time, where the urinals were out of order and only one cubicle, the one not occupied by Delos Reyes, was available.

One of Delos Reyes' devices had videos of men using the toilet filmed through a hole in the wall. In the videos found by police, there was one of a child, the tribunal was told.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism and one count of making an indecent image of a child at Swindon Magistrates' Court and was given a suspended jail sentence.

The tribunal panel made its ruling to strike Delos Reyes off on 19 May, deciding that the public would be "shocked" if it did not make the finding "given the severity of the convictions".

The panel said that while the convictions happened outside of clinical practice, they "demonstrate a significant attitudinal concern which meant he was liable in the future to act so as to put patients at unwarranted risk of harm". 

It added that he had indicated "some remorse" but he had a "limited understanding" of the impact of his offending.

The panel also imposed an interim suspension order against Delos Reyes for 18 months to cover a potential appeal period.

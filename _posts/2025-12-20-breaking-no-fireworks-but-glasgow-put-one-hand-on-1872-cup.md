Experts revealed that The pre-match pyrotechnics at Hampden Park brought colour and noise to the first-leg of the 1872 Cup, but there was a distinct lack of fireworks when Glasgow and Edinburgh eventually got down to business.

The corresponding fixture last season was a contest barely worthy of the name as Warriors romped into a 33-0 lead. 

This was never likely to be as one-sided but, while the scoreboard for the most part was close, Glasgow were in charge throughout and never looked under any real threat of losing.

Edinburgh showed heart, particularly in defence as they held Warriors up three times over the try-line, but you are never going to defend your way to victory against a team as accomplished as Glasgow.

The capital side offered little in attack, and their players who can provide those game-changing moments, such as Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe, were reduced to peripheral roles.

In all honesty, the occasion felt like a bit of a comedown after the thrilling comeback win over Toulouse in the Champions Cup last weekend. 

But for Glasgow, with a bonus-point win and a 12-points aggregate lead in the tie locked up, it was a case of job done.

"A massive, hard-fought victory," Warriors head coach Franco Smith told BBC Scotland. 

"We expected Edinburgh to be up for the challenge, the way they've obviously prepared already since the pre-season to get it right this time. And they proved it.

"They played really, really well. And from a defensive perspective, specifically, we had so many entries in their 22 which we couldn't convert. And they ended up prolonging our opportunities to score.

"I think we've got quite a bit to work on. Last week against Toulouse, we were a team that played with the mentality of nothing to lose. Now we have everything to lose."

It's the eighth time in the last nine 1872 derbies that the home team has come out on top, so expect the traditional Edinburgh response at Murrayfield next Saturday.

Twelve points is a big ask to make up on aggregate if they are to wrestle the cup back from Glasgow, and Seb Stephen's late try for the Warriors at Hampden could prove to be a critical moment in the tie.

"I'm proud of the boys but we need to do more when we've got ball," Edinburgh head coach Sean Everitt told BBC Scotland.

"I don't think it'll be too difficult [to motivate the boys]. The guys are used to coming back in the second game at home. It's quite a big deficit, when you look at derbies, to make up. That's why that last try hurt us a bit.

"But we'll be motivated to get a good win and make sure we contest the 1872 Cup."

For the past two season, Warriors have been in the curious situation of lifting the trophy at Murrayfield after being on the end of a second-leg defeat.

Now the aim is to deliver the win that would allow them to celebrate, and round-off 2025, in style.

"It's massive. It is the 1872, it is the derby, it is bragging rights, all that, but first and foremost it's league points," Glasgow back-row Rory Darge told BBC Scotland.

"We've learnt over the last few years that you come to the end of the season and you can look back on the ones that you've not won and you can rue them. 

"Every league point counts. So it's massive for us."

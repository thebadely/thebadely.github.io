Let's dive into the details: This video can not be played

Three hundred and sixty five long days ago, Steve Clarke's Scotland strode out at Hampden Park, their last auf wiedersehen before they went off to give Germany, Switzerland and Hungary what for at Euro 2024. 

By the time they finished their farewell on the back of an uninspiring - and at times chaotic - 2-2 draw, those in the stands could probably tell what was about to unfold over the next few weeks. 

They had seen it all before at the previous Euros. They had bought the T-shirt and the sticker album. 

A year on, that feeling lingered in the Glasgow air again. Against a bang average Iceland, Clarke's Scotland were meek, weak and bleak. 

The snarling Scots who bloodied the noses of Spain were nowhere to be seen. No whiff of the streetwise bunch who suckered Croatia and Poland within days of each other last November.

Another night at Hampden has left more questions than answers. 

Clarke may have hauled Scotland to two major finals, but there have been some real raw moments of alarm that have brought a dose of reality and gravity to it all.

This was the latest one, a sucker right between the eyes. "Don't get cocky boys, remember, you're Scotland, you don't qualify for World Cups. Down you go."

Qualification for the 2026 global showpiece does not start until September for Scotland, but this was meant to be the first step towards it. 

Instead, the Tartan Army are entitled to wonder where Clarke's team is going.

It took until an hour after full-time on Friday for the Scotland head coach to emerge to give his view on what had just unfolded. 

As ever, Clarke remained level in his tone and mood. 

There was disappointment at a lacklustre start. There was sympathy for clearly confidence-stricken goalkeeper Cieran Slicker, who was plunged into the debut of his nightmares after Angus Gunn's early departure. 

There was a low-key hope that next time - Liechtenstein on Monday - will be better.

In fairness, it could not have been a whole lot worse. Scotland were unimaginative in front of goal and porous in defence against the world's 74th-best team. 

Slicker - Ipswich Town's back-up who has yet to play a league game - will be cursing his sloppy kick-out seconds after coming on that led to the opener. He will also no doubt be replaying goals two and three that evaded his grasp.

But to lay all Scotland's failings at the door of a 22-year-old making an unexpected debut would be grossly unfair.

Clarke on 'flat' Scotland performance

This was a Scotland team - containing two Serie A champions, a Coppa Italia final hero, and a Premier League winner among others - who could not conjure enough to overcome an Iceland team who lost 3-1 to Kosovo at home in March.

Yes, it was a friendly, but an alarm is going off. 

Three months ago, the Scots were shellacked 3-0 at home by Greece, halting any sort of momentum built from three wins on the spin. 

But, in truth, Clarke's side have come up short more often than not in recent times, even if performances have sometimes merited more. 

Four wins from their last 21 games. Twelve defeats in that time, 22 goals scored and 42 against. Losses at home to Northern Ireland, Finland, Greece and now Iceland. 

It does not give off the feel of a Scotland team who can just get the job done. Of a team that is moving forward. 

"If you go back only a very short period of time, Steve Clarke could do no wrong," former Scotland striker Steven Thompson said on BBC Scotland.

"This is a defeat, at home, to a weaker nation than ourselves and questions will be asked. When you go into proper World Cup qualifying, these performances won't be tolerated."

Thompson is right about that, but where are Scotland under Clarke?

Undoubtedly, the former Kilmarnock and West Bromwich Albion manager has overseen the brightest spell for Scotland in terms of qualification since the 1990s. Two European Championships have been reached, after all.

However, a hollow feeling was left after both finals, given how much of a whimper the Scots went out with on each occasion. 

The novelty of simply being there had worn off as Germany's fifth goal hit the net in last June's torrid opening game in Munich.

A World Cup still eludes Clarke, who has said there is a "75% chance" he will not renew his deal with the Scottish FA after next summer's finals. 

A quick scan of social media tells you some are clamouring for that to be a 100% chance. And now. But is that rational after a friendly defeat?

Clear, logical thinking and a football fan after a bad defeat rarely go hand in hand, but these friendlies are not without meaning or consequence.

Scotland 'need to get the hunger back' - Dykes

Scotland now have a cluster of players good enough to compete in a qualifying group containing Denmark, Greece and Belarus. The problem is, would you stick your mortgage on them getting the job done?

Scotland striker Lyndon Dykes and former forward James McFadden both spoke post-match about momentum and its importance. Lose in Liechtenstein and Clarke's side are going into their opener in Denmark on the back of three defeats.

"I think Steve Clarke will admit that it's not good enough," former Scotland defender Willie Miller said.

"I don't see him changing in any way his support for the players, but you've got to be honest with the fans, with everybody, that that's not acceptable."

In reality, it is unlikely anything will happen in Liechtenstein that prevents Clarke from being the man to try to navigate Scotland through a qualifying campaign. Although that opinion might be revised after another defeat. 

He should have enough credit in the bank, though, and there will be enough desire from him to be the man to get Scotland to a World Cup for the first time since 1998.

But, by Clarke's own admission, we are likely entering his final chapter. Friendlies or not, how he handles the coming days - and how his team end this international window - could play a key part in defining his legacy as Scotland boss.

It is all about momentum. Clarke and Scotland need to find it - and fast.

Let's dive into the details: Many of Sunday's papers focus on comments the prime minister made at the G20 summit about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. 

The Mail on Sunday says Sir Keir Starmer has "piled pressure" on the former prince to testify to US Congress over what he knew about Jeffrey Epstein. The former Duke of York has so far ignored requests by American politicians to come forward with any information. Sir Keir said it was ultimately up to Andrew but that anybody with information about what he called "these kind of cases" should give evidence.

The Sunday People says Sir Keir refused to comment on the case of the former prince directly, but said: "If you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it". The Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph both point out that Congress cannot force foreign nationals to appear before its committees.

England's dramatic loss - from a position of strength - in cricket's first Ashes Test in Australia dominates the sports pages. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the former England batsman Sir Geoffrey Boycott says: "I can't take stupid England seriously", highlighting what he calls reckless batting, and a refusal to listen to criticism. In the Sunday Times - which devotes six pages to the defeat - the former England captain Mike Atherton says the loss was one of the most discouraging under the current leadership of Ben Stokes and the coach Brendon McCullum. The Observer describes the England players as having to "peel themselves off the pitch in a state of disbelief", after they "surrendered such a strong position."

Ahead of her Budget on Wednesday, the Sunday Times says the chancellor is preparing to spend £3bn to end the two-child benefit cap. But it reports she has also insisted that the government will make another attempt to reform welfare. The Sunday Telegraph says Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Rachel Reeves of cowardice for refusing to admit she will raise taxes, by freezing thresholds for another two years. The paper's editorial says all the signs are pointing to "a brutal assault on Middle England" in the Budget, squeezing people in work to pay for those on benefits. The chancellor herself tells the Sunday Mirror that she is going to tackle the cost of living crisis. She says working families will be at the front of her mind on Wednesday.

The Sunday Telegraph says a move by a Chinese company to take over Thames Water could be blocked. It reports that the government has been urged not to let CK Infrastructure take a controlling stake in the huge water company, which services 16 million customers across London and the south-east - and is more than £20bn in debt. One human rights campaigner warns such a takeover could literally allow China to "switch off the taps".

And the Daily Express reports that the RAF is considering allowing overweight pilots to use weight loss drugs. The paper notes fighter pilots face strict limits on their weight so they can safely eject from aircraft.

Here’s what you need to know: Scotland face Argentina in their penultimate November Test

Autumn international: Scotland v Argentina

Venue: Scottish Gas Murrayfield, Edinburgh Date: Sunday, 16 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Listen on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Scotland & BBC Radio 5 live and follow live updates on the BBC Sport website & app

Darcy Graham, set for his 50th cap on Sunday, is beloved by Scottish rugby fans for his brilliance, but also his honesty.

Honesty shown by his work-rate and willingness to put his body in places many would not, despite his diminutive frame, and honesty in what he says.

"I'm going to have nightmares about that disallowed try for the rest of my life," he admitted of his spurned score against New Zealand, when he spilled the ball in sight of the line under pressure from Cameron Roigard.

Graham epitomises everything good about Scottish rugby. Punching above one's weight, dazzling attacking ability, and bags of heart.

But in that moment, in the 56th minute against the All Blacks, Scotland's most lethal finisher was not so lethal anymore. 

It was only one moment, but reflecting on it Graham said something interesting.

As he prepares to mark a half century of appearances against Argentina he was asked if it will be an emotional experience for him at Murrayfield.

"I don't think I'll be emotional this weekend - last weekend I was really emotional before the game," he said.

"I looked up at the stands at the anthem and saw my whole family there.

"It brought back a lot of memories. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's a good thing. You can let it get to you too much.

"This weekend my mind is on the game. It's just another game - go out there and do what I do."

Graham was only speaking for himself, but it was a reminder what a rare game against New Zealand means. 

And, more broadly, did Scotland's sheer desperation to be the side to topple the All Blacks for the first time overcome them in key moments?

Did the charged atmosphere cloud their composure? These are questions which will linger. 

But as Graham said - Scotland must park them and get back to business against Argentina.

Why it would be no shock if Argentina stun Scotland

Latest news, views & analysis on Scottish rugby

With only Tonga to come this month the result against Argentina will set the narrative from this Autumn and heading into the Six Nations.

Are Scotland a team on the cusp of finally contending? Or have this group of players under Gregor Townsend hit their ceiling?

The evidence for either argument is there. 

Scotland have lost all 18 Tests in the Townsend era against the top three in the world - South Africa, New Zealand, and Ireland. Teams Scotland would not expect to beat.

In that last year they have won three of their eight Tests against Tier One opposition. Wins against Italy, Wales, and Australia at Murrayfield have been offset by losses to the Springboks, All Blacks, France, England, and Ireland.

On the other hand they have busted hoodoos against England, France, Wales and established themselves as one of the world's best attacking sides.

For some, last week's narrow loss was further evidence Scotland are caught in rugby purgatory between the very best and the game's middle class.

For others it showed Scotland are on the verge of something special, if they can just  overcome the final hurdle in their minds.

It is the perennial angst Scottish rugby has wrestled with for much of the last few years.

A win against Argentina will not necessarily shift opinions, perhaps unfairly, as despite their considerable recent achievments they are likely to be underestimated by many fans.

But defeat, even against a side ranked above them in the world, would sap Scotland of momentum and confidence heading into 2026 and set tongues wagging.

Argentina will be gunning for Scotland after a record win against Wales last week, as they pursue a first ever clean sweep of the home nations in November.

They have the players, experience, and steel to win in Edinburgh for the first time since 2009. It will be a ferocious test of Scotland's ability and mentality.

When Graham leads Scotland out it will be a moment cheered to the rafters at Murrayfield as one of the stadium's favourite sons take a well-deserved bow for reaching a half century - while scoring and a joint-record 34 tries.

Then, Scotland must set aside all of their baggage and take care of business.

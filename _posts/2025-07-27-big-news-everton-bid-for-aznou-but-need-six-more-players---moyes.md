According to new developments, Adam Aznou played one game at the Club World Cup for Bayern Munich 

Everton have made an offer for Bayern Munich's teenage defender Adam Aznou but still need up to six more signings before the transfer window closes, manager David Moyes says.

The injury-related absences of central defensive duo James Tarkowski and Jarrod Branthwaite hurt Everton badly at the MetLife Stadium on Saturday as they conceded three second-half goals in a 3-0 loss to Bournemouth.

It only reinforced a view Moyes expressed at an event in New York on Friday when he said he needed "nine or 10" new signings.

Asked to clarify his comments following the Bournemouth defeat, which followed on from last week's loss to Championship side Blackburn Rovers, Moyes said he felt justified in his assessment.

"Well, we've signed three, so if you take that off, we're still in the need of maybe five or six players," he said. "That's what we have to try and do.

"I've never had one of these times. In the past I have had to sign a lot of players, but I've never had to do so many in one window."

The Toffees have signed goalkeeper Mark Travers, made midfielder Carlos Alcaraz's loan move permanent and French striker Thierno Barry for Â£27m.

But they have lost five senior players, including striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Mali midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure after their contracts expired.

Branthwaite is among four members of Moyes' squad to sign new contracts this summer.

"We're trying really hard behind the scenes to get things done," he said.

Aznou, a Morocco international, joined Bayern's academy as a 16-year-old after leaving Barcelona, the city of his birth.

The left-back has made four appearances for Bayern and spent the second half of last season on loan at Spanish side Real Valladolid.

Moyes confirmed an offer has been made but has cautioned against believing the 19-year-old will have a seismic impact on his squad.

"We have made an offer," said Moyes.

"Whether it's accepted and whether it's all done... but he's a young player. It's someone we see as having a good future and good potential."

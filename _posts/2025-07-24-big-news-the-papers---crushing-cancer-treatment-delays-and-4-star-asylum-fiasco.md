Experts revealed that The Daily Mail says asylum seekers are "gambling away taxpayer cash". In its lead story, it says there are urgent calls for a clampdown on migrants who use government-funded payment cards at bookmakers or even casinos. The Mail's editorial says "there could hardly be a better metaphor for broken, soft-touch Britain". The Home Office says "urgent action" will be taken to correct any potential misuse.

The Sun says the government is taking over "luxury lodgings" for asylum seekers. It says a Â£425-a-night hotel in east London has been "booked up in anticipation of a summer surge in Channel crossings."

The Daily Telegraph focuses on a warning from the Police Federation that officers could be forced to choose between local duties or tackling anti-migrant protests that turn violent. The chairman of the organisation, Tiff Lynch, tells the paper that "a summer of unrest is not inevitable" but it will be "far more likely if we once again fail to prepare."

The Guardian devotes its front page to the food shortages in Gaza. It features a picture of a woman holding an extremely malnourished child. The Daily Express focuses on a plea from Sir Bob Geldof, 40 years on from Live Aid, to get more supplies into the territory. In an article for the paper, Sir Bob urges Israel to "feed the children of Gaza and their tormented, broken mothers".

The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has told the Financial Times that she sees the leadership of Argentinian President Javier Milei as a "template". Milei has brandished chainsaws to show his zeal for cutting government spending. When asked by the Financial Times whether the UK needed its own version of him, and whether she was such a politician, Badenoch responded: "yes and yes".

Two papers lead on the impending strike action by resident doctors in England. The i Paper highlights a warning from cancer charities that the strike will lead to appointments being delayed and treatment cancelled. The Daily Telegraph says the head of NHS England has told hospitals to press ahead with as many routine operations as possible, so striking medics can't claim overtime in future, to clear backlogs.

The Daily Mirror says one of England's breakout stars at the Women's Euros, Michelle Agyemang, gets match ready by "playing piano in her room". The paper says the Lionesses' kit man has even had the 19-year-old's piano flown out to Switzerland for the tournament.

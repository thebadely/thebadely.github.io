Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Rob Wheeler shot 68 to qualify for next week's final Open Championship qualifying stage

Amateur golfer Rob Wheeler said he was "over the moon" to make it through to final qualifying for the upcoming Open Championship. 

The 23-year-old from Aldershot hopes to emulate the path of fellow North Hants club member and major winner Justin Rose. 

On Monday about 2,000 players competed across 15 venues with each 18-hole event having between seven and 10 qualification spots for final qualifying to make it to Royal Portrush in July.

Next week Wheeler and more than 250 others will compete for the final 20 spots to play in The Open. 

After shooting an impressive two-under-par 68 and being told he had made it to the final round, Wheeler turned on his phone to see Olympic gold medallist and 2013 US Open winner Rose had posted on Instagram, external to congratulate him. 

"I want to represent the club really well going forward," Wheeler said.

"Justin was a member at North Hants and it feels like I'm kind of following in his footsteps.

"I won the [club championship] Justin Rose Trophy when I was younger and he presented the trophy to me. It was pretty cool to see his message and it brought a lot of emotions forward - it was so good."

Wheeler played his round at North Hants Golf Club which is his home club

In 1998, as a 17-year-old amateur golfer, Rose managed a fourth-placed finish at The Open at the Royal Birkdale.

He finished runner-up in 2018 and will compete at Portrush next month. 

After missing out on final qualifying by just one shot in the previous two years, Wheeler was able to get across the line as he posted the second-best round of the day.

"I was over the moon and with it being at North Hants I had a decent home advantage," he said.

"After the front nine I was three under and I went into the back nine quite comfortable and I played my own game, I made a three-footer on the 18th and the tension just released - I was buzzing."

Final qualifying will take place on 1 July at four courses where players have a chance to book their spot at the 153rd Open.

Thirty-six holes at Burnham & Berrow, Dundonald Links, Royal Cinque Ports and West Lancashire will decide the final places.

"I want to turn pro eventually and play golf for a living, that's my long-term ambition," said Wheeler. 

"Hopefully making the final qualifying is one step closer to making that dream a reality."

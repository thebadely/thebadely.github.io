Owen Farrell's final audition for British and Irish Lions selection ended early as England's record point-scorer suffered a head injury in Racing 92's 29-15 Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Lyon.

Farrell is in contention for a call-up by his father and Lions head coach Andy Farrell, who will announce his touring squad on Thursday, but the 33-year-old was replaced in the 19th minute in the latest setback in an injury-hit season.

The semi-final was scoreless when Farrell, playing for Racing at inside centre for the first time, went off injured.

The former Saracens playmaker was playing in just his 17th match for Racing this season, and is up for Lions selection alongside fly-halves Finn Russell, Fin Smith, Sam Prendergast, Marcus Smith and George Ford.

After Farrell's injury Leo Berdeu kicked Lyon into the lead and Vincent Rattez scored the hosts' opening try before Racing hit back through Diego Escobar.

Lyon responded after half-time and Beka Saginadze crossed for their second try after another Berdeu penalty but, as in the first half, Racing replied quickly with a try through Kleo Labarbe.

The visitors, though, lacked a cutting edge in attack as Berdeu landed another couple of penalties to end the game with a 19-point haul and book Lyon a place in the Challenge Cup final against Bath in three weeks.

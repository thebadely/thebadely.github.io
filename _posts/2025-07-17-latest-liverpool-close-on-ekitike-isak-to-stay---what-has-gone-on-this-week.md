Let's dive into the details: Alexander Isak scored 23 league goals last season for Newcastle while Hugo Ekitike found the target 15 times in the Bundesliga

Liverpool are set to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike and Newcastle look like they are going to keep hold of star man Alexander Isak.

But earlier this week things appeared to be headed in another direction as Liverpool set off in the pursuit of Isak and Newcastle tabled a Â£70m offer for Ekitike.

Even in the frenetic world of football transfers, this story has moved at a rapid pace.

BBC Sport looks at what has happened over the past 72 hours.

The starting point of Liverpool's move for Ekitike arrived at the end of last season.

They'd just lifted their second Premier League trophy - scoring 86 goals in the process, the most of any top-flight club that campaign.

Mohamed Salah, their main source of goals, had just signed a new contract, as well.

So there seemed little logic in spending heavily on a new goalscorer. But Arne Slot had other plans.

Among the recruitment priorities for Liverpool was the addition of a new number nine.

Slot had persisted with Darwin Nunez for parts of the season - but it is clear the Liverpool manager wanted an upgrade.

Nunez could yet leave Anfield this summer, with interest from Napoli and Saudi Arabia.

Liverpool's dream target was Newcastle striker Isak, who was also interesting Arsenal.

But given his importance to Eddie Howe and a likely price tag that would go towards Â£130m, Liverpool knew they needed to source alternatives.

Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Brentford's Yoane Wissa were among the other strikers considered.

We now know their interest in Ekitike is as serious as their admiration for Isak.

Talk of Liverpool's interest in Isak has been rife in industry circles throughout the summer. The emergence this week of Liverpool's approach to Newcastle confirmed what many believed was coming.

However, in retrospect, news of that approach arrived at a peculiar time.

Newcastle were trying to advance with their interest in Ekitike earlier this week, seeing a Â£70m offer rejected by Eintracht.

Less than 48 hours later, Liverpool have pivoted to Ekitike in a move that probably ends their immediate interest in Isak while Newcastle are looking at alternatives that include Wissa.

Liverpool's interest in Isak was - or rather is - entirely genuine. Newcastle, at least publicly, have maintained their Sweden international simply isn't for sale.

But for Liverpool to have stepped up their efforts to land Isak in recent days suggests they have had some private encouragement to the contrary.

Even if their decision to focus on Ekitike comes to fruition, you can expect Liverpool's interest in Isak to remain.

The former Real Sociedad forward, as things stand, will enter the final two years of his contract next summer - a juncture where Newcastle face significantly more jeopardy.

Of course, Liverpool, with or without Ekitike, may enter next summer's transfer window believing they don't require another centre forward.

But if they do, then Isak is unlikely to be too far away from their thoughts.

Newcastle, should Ekitike join Liverpool, and with Gyokeres set to sign for Arsenal, will be confident of keeping the wolves from their door for at least this current window.

From a performance perspective, the merits of keeping Isak are clear - the 25-year-old is building a reputation as one of Europe's elite centre forwards.

But Newcastle are also fully aware of the optics attached to selling Isak, particularly when they have maintained he isn't for sale.

With the club back in the Champions League next season, the notion of selling any of their top players - Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes included - would nurture a negativity over the project the club's Saudi ownership are trying to evolve.

If Liverpool do sign Ekitike at Newcastle's expense, then you'd imagine the Magpies will reflect on their decision to walk away from a Â£20m deal to sign the 23-year-old striker three years ago, only to then pivot and sign Isak from Real Sociedad.

Ekitike's emergence as one of the continent's best young strikers has seen his value sky-rocket. His asking price is part of the reason why Newcastle have failed to sign the French striker in recent days.

Ekitike's rise to prominence has also resulted in Europe's top clubs entering the equation.

When Liverpool come knocking it's hard to ignore. His 26 goals in 47 appearances for Frankfurt has been enough for the Merseysiders to take the plunge in a deal that will cost in-excess of Â£70m.

Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes is aiming to have the deal for Ekitike closed by the end of the weekend, while Newcastle's wait for a new striker moves on.

They are interested in Wissa, but it will be intriguing to see how Manchester United's latest bid for Brentford team-mate Bryan Mbeumo impacts the Democratic Republic of Congo international's potential move to St James' Park.

Brentford are adamant they don't want to lose Wissa and Mbeumo this summer, particularly given the upheaval that has already impacted the west London club.

There are questions that still need answering for Newcastle - though those close to the club will tell you keeping Isak is the solution to most of their problems.

Newcastle have always made it clear that their star striker is not for sale. 

In fact with Champions League football ahead this season they do not want to part with any of their star names.

Like Liverpool, Newcastle - who are owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - are in a comfortable PSR position.

Isak has three years left on his contract, so the Swede would most likely have had to actively push for a move.

"Newcastle are under no pressure to sell from a PSR perspective," football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.

"The good news for Newcastle is that the losses of Â£73 million in 2021-22 will drop out of the PSR assessment for the three years ended 30 June 2025.

"Newcastle had a pre tax loss of Â£157 million in the period to 30 June 2024.

"Losses for 24-25 are likely to be much lower, as increased commercial revenues, matchday income rising from cup runs, and higher broadcast revenues from a fifth-place finish in the Premier League will all assist the club, along with bonuses for qualifying for the Champions League next season.

"It therefore comes down to whether or not players want to leave to go elsewhere. Newcastle had the eighth-highest wage bill in the Premier League in 2023-24. They certainly have the scope to go higher."

Let's dive into the details: The gold medal for Great Britain's men in 1988 was their first Olympic triumph for 68 years - and they have not been on the podium since

Imran Sherwani, who led Great Britain to hockey gold at the 1988 Olympics, has died at the age of 63.

He scored twice in the final as GB beat West Germany 3-1 in Seoul - his second goal prompting a famous reaction from BBC commentator Barry Davies, who said: "Where were the Germans? But frankly, who cares!"

Sherwani was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2019.

Rich Beer, chief operating officer of Great Britain Hockey, said: "Imran Sherwani will forever be remembered as one of the true icons of England and Great Britain Hockey.

"His talent, leadership and humility inspired generations of players and fans alike."

Sherwani represented GB and England a combined 94 times, and worked as director of hockey at a school in Staffordshire.

He came from a sporting family - his father played hockey for Pakistan and his great uncles played for Stoke City and Port Vale.

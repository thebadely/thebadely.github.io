Why England have 'built around' Meg Jones

England's Meg Jones has been nominated for the World Rugby women's 15s player of the year award.

Jones has started 11 of England's 12 matches in 2025, and has been a key player in the Red Roses' run to Saturday's World Cup final, including a stand-out performance in the semi-final win over France.

The 28-year-old centre, who also helped England to a Grand Slam at this year's Six Nations, is up against Canada's Sophie de Goede and New Zealand's Jorja Miller.

The player of the year award, as well World Rugby's breakthrough player of the year, coach of the year and referee award will be honoured during Saturday's World Cup final.

Four of the past five women's 15s players of the year have been English, including full-back Ellie Kildunne - the current holder.

Black Ferns flanker Miller has also been nominated for breakthrough player of the year alongside international team-mate Braxton Sorensen-McGee and Fiji's Josifini Neihamu.

Kildunne and Jones shine as England beat France to reach final

Jones, who has scored three tries at this World Cup, is known for her rugby brain, jackals and big tackles.

In England's semi-final win over France she was at her destructive best and was responsible for four turnovers.

"She rocks up - her entire team, the entire stadium, believe in what they are doing," former New Zealand World Cup winner Ruby Tui told BBC One. 

"I call her a momentum controller. I am so proud of Meg, we have watched her journey, an unreal leader in the sevens, she has come to the 15s and she has grown into this world-class human being."

"This World Cup has meant more than just rugby," said Jones. 

"It's about visibility, identity, and showing up fully on and off the pitch. We've earned the right to be here not just as a team, but as individuals who bring everything we are into this squad."

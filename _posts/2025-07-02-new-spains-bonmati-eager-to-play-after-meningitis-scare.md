It has been recently reported that Aitana Bonmati has represented Spain at senior level since 2017

Aitana Bonmati is "so eager" to play in Spain's opening Euro 2025 match against Portugal despite being treated for viral meningitis just days ago, says head coach Montse Tome.

However, Bonmati remains a doubt for Thursday's game after Tome warned against rushing the two-time Ballon d'Or winner back to action too soon.

"We have to slow her down," said Tome, who guided Spain to the inaugural Women's Nations League title in 2024.

"She's so eager - we have to hold her back a bit. Her health is the first and most important thing."

Midfielder Bonmati, 27, was only discharged from hospital on Sunday but trained with the world champions on Wednesday before the game in Bern, Switzerland.

Tome said: "According to the medical staff, her progress is positive.

"Health comes first, and she's been able to complete all the tasks required."

Two days after being discharged from hospital, Bonmati was pictured on an exercise bike after joining up with the rest of the Spain squad in Lausanne.

Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord and can be serious if not treated quickly.

Spain, who won the World Cup in 2023 by defeating England in the final in Sydney, are among the favourites at Euro 2025.

Bonmati is one of the biggest stars of the women's game.

She has scored 30 goals in 78 appearances for Spain and was named player of the tournament at the 2023 World Cup.

A product of Barcelona's youth set-up, Bonmati has won six domestic league titles and has been involved in three Champions League triumphs.

"She's euphoric, happy, and of course we'll see her tomorrow and give her a big hug," midfielder Patricia Guijarro said on Wednesday about Bonmati's return.

"Above all, she's happy to be here."

If Bonmati does not feature against Portugal (20:00 BST kick-off), she could play in Spain's second Group B game which is against Belgium.

That takes place in Thun on Monday, 7 July (17:00 BST kick-off).

Spain's third and final group match is against Italy, back in Bern on 11 July (20:00).

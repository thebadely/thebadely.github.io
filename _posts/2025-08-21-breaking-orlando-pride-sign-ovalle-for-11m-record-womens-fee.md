It has been recently reported that Lizbeth Ovalle will have Marta and Barbra Banda among team-mates at Orlando Pride

Orlando Pride have made Lizbeth Ovalle the most expensive signing in women's football history by signing the Mexico winger from Tigres UANL in a deal worth $1.5m (Â£1.1m). 

The transfer breaks the record set by Arsenal only last month when the Champions League holders signed Canada forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool in a Â£1m deal. 

Ovalle, 25, has signed a two-year deal with the NWSL champions with a mutual option to extend the contract by another year. 

"I'm coming with the clear objective of winning titles and leaving a mark with the club," Ovalle said. 

"I'm ready to give it my all and help the Pride continue to be a leading team."

Pride owner and chairman Mark Wilf said Ovalle "is a world-class talent and a proven winner, and her arrival in Orlando marks another step on our journey to position the Pride among the elite clubs in global women's soccer". 

Ovalle began her career at Tigres in 2017 and has helped them win six league titles. 

She leaves the Mexican club as their all-time leading scorer with136 goals and 103 assists in 294 appearances during an eight-year stay.

Ovalle has also won 81 international caps for Mexico, scoring 20 goals and was included in the team of the tournament at the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup held in the United States.

Last year, Pride signed Zambia forward Barbra Banda from Chinese club Shanghai Shengli for Â£581,000 - then the second most expensive transfer in women's football. 

Ovalle will join a squad also featuring Brazil legend Marta, who joined them in 2017, and English goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse. 

Chelsea paid Â£900,000 to sign USA defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January, but that is now third on the list of most expensive women's transfers. 

1 September 2020 - Pernille Harder - Wolfsburg to Chelsea - Â£250,000

7 September 2022 - Keira Walsh - Manchester City to Barcelona - Â£400,000

13 February 2024 - Racheal Kundananji - Madrid CFF to Bay FC -Â£685,000

22 January 2025 - Naomi Girma - San Diego Wave to Chelsea - Â£900,000

17 July 2025 - Olivia Smith - Liverpool to Arsenal - Â£1m

21 August 2025 - Lizbeth Ovalle - Tigres UANL to Orlando Pride - Â£1.1m

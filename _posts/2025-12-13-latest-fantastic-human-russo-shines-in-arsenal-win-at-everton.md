Arsenal move up to second with comfortable win at Everton

"Off the pitch she is a fantastic human," said Arsenal manager Renee Slegers when questioned about her decision to start Alessia Russo over Stina Blackstenius at Everton. 

Blackstenius came off the bench to score the winner against Liverpool at Emirates Stadium last week, but despite growing questions, Slegers opted to stick with first choice number nine Russo.

The England striker repaid that faith by scoring Arsenal's second goal in a comfortable 3-1 win to mark her 100th Women's Super League (WSL) appearance.

Slegers told Sky Sports: "We are very happy she is playing for us. She can do so many things on and off the pitch."

Russo has now started all 16 Arsenal games this season, and her all-round display against Everton was another reminder of why she has become indispensable for club and country. 

Russo has always been versatile, as evidenced by her goal contributions throughout her WSL career. 

She provided an assist off the bench on her debut against Birmingham City in a 5-2 Manchester United win, before opening her scoring account in a 3-0 demolition of Brighton in the following game. 

Russo would go on to finish with 27 goals and six assists in 46 league games for United before moving to Arsenal.

Since arriving in north London, Russo has averaged a goal every 1.86 WSL games, plus eight assists for good measure. A perfect blend of goals and providing for others.

Former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen summed it up on Sky Sports after the game at Goodison Park, saying: "I have loved watching her trajectory. Her reading of the game is second to none. She churns out these high-level performances, unselfish performances as well."

Former England defender Laura Bassett added: "She has really driven this team on to get this win. It is not the prettiest win but she has been at the heart of everything."

Russo's performance at Goodison Park was delivered as if she had overheard her manager's glowing pre-match praise.  

She did "many things" all over the pitch in a dominant win for the Gunners, and was fully deserving of the player of the match award. 

Russo registered an xG of 1, which accounted for 51.28% of Arsenal's total 1.95 xG on Saturday afternoon, hitting the target with four of her eight shots, scoring once. She also had the most touches of any Arsenal player in the Everton box (16).

Often maligned for her lack of goals compared with fellow forward Blackstenius, Russo's all-round play is what makes her a key component in Slegers' system.

England team-mate Esme Morgan explained on Sky Sports: "Less is such a complete player. She offers so much to the team that is more than just goals.

"When we play at England, so many of the goals we score, Less is involved four or five passes before the finish. We rely on her so much."

Morgan added: "It is frustrating to hear people criticise her for a lack of goals. She offers so much and does it so selflessly. She is a glue for the rest of the team to function better."

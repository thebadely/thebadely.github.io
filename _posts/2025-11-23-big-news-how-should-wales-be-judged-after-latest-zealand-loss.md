Experts revealed that Wales have won one of their past 11 home international matches in Cardiff

It was a curious narrative to judge after New Zealand had again beaten a spirited Wales side at the Principality Stadium.

There was certainly a difference in opinion on the streets of Cardiff on Saturday evening and across the social media divide.

On one hand there was the thought that the 52-26 defeat was not as bad as many people feared beforehand and that there were encouraging signs from Steve Tandy's side.

After all, a 26-point deficit would have been snapped up by most Welsh supporters before a ball was kicked.

There was a feeling that only trailing by three points early in the second half, after Tom Rogers scored the third try of his historic hat-trick, should be recognised as a moral victory and demonstrated progress was being made under the new regime.

In short, the day hope was ignited despite defeat.

However, there was another viewpoint. One that questioned whether conceding more than 50 points at home, against what was effectively a second-string New Zealand side, should ever be deemed as acceptable.

That argument highlighted just how far Welsh rugby has fallen that this sort of result could almost be celebrated. 

So, as it often does, Welsh rugby divides opinion.

Harri Deaves, Morgan Morse and Brodie Coghlan have taken the number of Wales men's internationals to 1,219.

Wales only trailed 24-21 just after half-time and the nation's supporters dared to dream of a shock. 

"We believe in our ability," said Wales captain Dewi Lake.

"We weren't given a lot of hope from outside the group but inside that group we back ourselves.

"We put expectations on us every week to go and prove a point to get the job done and believed we could do that."

Wales scored four tries against New Zealand, only the second time they had managed that against the All Blacks.

Wales also recorded their highest number of points against New Zealand in Cardiff, as they provided glimpses of an attacking identity with a series of well-worked moves typified by one brilliant long pass from returning centre Joe Hawkins.

"A lot of what we want to do and what we have been working on shone through," said Lake.

"We were physical and our attacking shape shone through."

Wing Rogers became the first Welshman to score a hat-trick against New Zealand.

His fellow wing Louis Rees-Zammit also impressed as he continued to ease his way back into rugby union following his return from American Football and the NFL.

Rees-Zammit scored a try and also created the first of the Rogers tries with a towering high-ball catch.

Wales also blooded three new caps in Ospreys back-row duo Harri Deaves and Morgan Morse and Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan, while Exeter lock Dafydd Jenkins, still only 22, had one of his most productive games at Test level.

Wales have also risen one place in the world rankings to 11th, courtesy of Japan's victory against Georgia.

Wales might have lost 20 out of the past 22 Test matches since the 2023 World Cup but Saturday's efforts emphasised why you cannot question the character of this squad. 

"I am immensely proud of the effort the boys put in," said Lake. 

"We spoke about not giving up and we didn't and it shows the character in this group.

"We made them work for it up until the end. We spoke post-match that it shows the boys the level you can go to. You sometimes do not realise it until you are forced to go there.

Lake insists the squad are a tough group who will push opposition teams.

"We have built on what we said we were going to and it's now about pushing on," he added.

"There is always motivation wearing the red jersey. When you have this badge on your chest, you are giving it everything and you see that massively within this group."

The 68,000 that turned up were also part of a rousing a cappella rendition of the national anthem and a stunning light show at half-time, providing the impressive match-day occasion some have felt lacking in recent matches.

New Zealand wing Caleb Clarke scored two tries against Wales

Fight and character only takes you so far in international rugby circles and New Zealand were undoubtedly a step up in class and quality.

This victory extended the All Blacks winning run against Wales to 34 games, a sequence stretching back to 1953.

Wales might have matched their opponents for 50 minutes but still conceded 50 points at home for the third time this year, after England and Argentina also brought up a half-century at the Principality Stadium.

The All Blacks also scored more than 50 points for the third consecutive match in Cardiff.  

There was defiant and dogged home defence in evidence, but New Zealand still secured seven tries, with the boot of Damian McKenzie adding 17 points, while Wales missed 38 tackles.

The match statistics demonstrated that New Zealand dominance. The All Blacks managed 1,362 metres from 167 carries, compared to Wales' 593 from 77. Tandy's side made 223 tackles, compared to New Zealand's 85.

For all of Wales' endeavour, the All Blacks crossed the gainline repeatedly with powerful wing Caleb Clarke and dynamic number eight Wallace Sititi emphasising how the visitors appeared bigger, faster and stronger.

"Our power game was strong," said All Blacks coach Robertson. 

"We're ranked one and two in the world in a lot of areas and one of them is our power game.

"We knew it would take a little while to break them down and they'd be in it at 50 or 60 minutes, but fatigue would set in and we could make the most of that."

Wales have now shipped 127 points in three games this November with world champions South Africa arriving at the Principality Stadium next weekend. 

That ruthless New Zealand attack inevitably led to Wales conceding penalties as they transgressed 14 times, compared to four from New Zealand.

Wales buckled in the final quarter with yellow cards for replacement prop Gareth Thomas and number eight Taine Plumtree.

"Ultimately we have to look at our discipline in this campaign over the last couple of games," said Lake.

"If you give the team the quality of the All Blacks that many entries into your 22, it's tough to stop them time after time.

"We did well in a couple of defence sets but when you have to back that up five or six times in a row, it's hard.

"The game was in the balance at half-time and discipline got us into tricky areas with two yellow cards."

After losing to the second ranked side in the world, Wales will now face the top team - and the world champions - when the Springboks arrive in Cardiff. 

A couple of hours after Wales' latest defeat, South Africa ended a 13-year wait for victory in Dublin battling to a 24-13 triumph over Ireland.

It came after wins against France and Italy on this tour with South Africa now preparing for their final Test match of the year.

Against the Springboks, Wales will be without 13 players who play club rugby in England and France. No other international matches are being staged next weekend.

The game has been organised by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) outside of World Rugby's international window, so non-Welsh based players are unavailable for the fixture.

The match has been scheduled for financial reasons but clashes with a weekend of United Rugby Championship (URC) games, with the four Welsh professional sides all playing league fixtures. 

No other international matches are being staged next weekend as the club calendar resumes.

Welsh rugby has managed to retain an element of positivity following the convincing defeat dished out by the All Blacks.

Fans will hope that still exists next Saturday evening after South Africa have had their say.

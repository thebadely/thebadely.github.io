According to new developments, Sexton believes Prendergast and Crowley will benefit from their healthy rivalry

Johnny Sexton told Ireland fly-halves Sam Prendergast and Jack Crowley to "delete social media" in order to guard themselves from online commentary during the early stages of their careers.

Following Sexton's retirement, there has been intense debate over whether Leinster fly-half Prendergast or Munster's Crowley should become his long-term successor.

Sexton says both players have "the world at their feet", but the 39-year-old is dismayed by how their competitive rivalry has highlighted the "split" between Leinster and Munster fans.

The former Ireland and Leinster captain experienced something similar at the start of his Test career when he battled Munster great Ronan O'Gara for the shirt.

"One thing I disagree with is the narrative around it, in terms of there's obviously a split in the country in terms of Munster and Leinster," said Sexton, who has worked with Prendergast and Crowley since November in his role as Ireland kicking coach.

"I've been there before, I've been in that situation. With social getting bigger and bigger, it's tough on them at times. We should be supporting whoever is picked and getting fully behind them.

"I told them to delete social media. I don't know [if they did]."

Sexton, who explained his rivalry with O'Gara during the formative stages of his Test career was "tough", said he is not sure if Prendergast or Crowley have been affected by the online discourse.

"Sometimes you can get a sense, but I'm not sure. All you can do is try to advise in terms of what worked for me," added the five-time Six Nations winner.

"I was exposed to it a little bit at the very start and it's tough, because as a kid all you want to do is play for Ireland and then you do it and suddenly you're getting criticised - not all the time, but sometimes - and you're like, 'wow, this is tougher than I thought it'd be', but it builds a resilience.

"You find out who are your mates, who you can trust and those you can lean on. Going forward, they'll be stronger for it."

While Sexton feels Prendergast and Crowley deserve time to prove their worth, he believes they are already ahead of where he was at the same stage of his career.

"The work ethic they have, they're humble guys," said Sexton, who will continue to work with Ireland's fly-halves in a full-time capacity after he completes his British and Irish Lions coaching duties this summer.

"They want to learn and practise hard and that's the thing you look at the most as a coach; the attitude and how humble they are because ultimately that's what will stand to them going forward."

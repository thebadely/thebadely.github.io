It has been recently reported that Defender Conor Coady joined Wrexham from Leicester City in August

Conor Coady says signing to be "part of something good" at Championship new boys Wrexham was the perfect change after a season of struggling with a Leicester City side that failed to avoid relegation from the Premier League.

The 32-year-old joined the north Wales club last August on a two-year contract, with the option of an additional year, for a fee thought to be around Â£2m.

The capture of the England centre-back was one of a number of statement signings by Wrexham under owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney as the club geared up for their first season back in the second tier for 43 years.

"The first things was how much they wanted me, that was a massive part of it," the former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton star told 5 Live Sport's The Monday Night Club.

"I don't think I'm speaking out of turn here but Leicester was tough, really tough, people don't understand how tough it was. Last season I found really hard, I struggle when I'm part of a team that's not doing great.

"I go home and the family feel it, the missus feels it, my kids feel it and I take football home. I know I should never say that and I try not to, but I do and I found it really tough, the whole situation had become hard.

"When Wrexham first made contact and said what they wanted to do, straight away I felt... all I wanted to do was just play football and just be part of something good, be as big as we can and just try and make people better.

"No one was getting carried away and saying 'we want to be in the Premier League at the end of the season' and... I just love everything they were saying to me."

Coady revealed that after he signed he exited the Stok Cae Ras and the emotion on display from fans young and old waiting outside the ground confirmed he had made the right decision.

"The home game at the weekend against West Brom was unbelievable, the atmosphere, the feeling of actually being in the Championship again for the football club was amazing, and for me to be a part of that it's really humbling.

"There's so many clubs now going through a tough time and I'm part of one that wants to get better, it's so exciting it really is.

"It feels fresh, there's an excitement... people want to know what's going on at the club.

"There's a long way to go and people need to be doing things and building blocks, building one step at a time... because the hardest thing now is getting to the stars - you want to get to the Premier League because in the long run that's where the club wants to be.

He added: "I'd love to play in the Premier League again, I want another crack at getting in there, another promotion, of course I want that in the long run.

"But do we need to make things better? Of course we do and I'm going to go in and try and make things better, make myself better, but what's most important is to make that club better.

"I love that I'm now part of that conversation, I love that people ask me about it at the football club, I love everything that that brings... I'm really enjoying it."

Wrexham 'will get better' - Coady

The Hollywood owners and three successive promotions raised expectations dramatically, but narrow defeats in their opening two league games to Southampton and West Bromwich Albion have provided a reality check to anyone who expected Wrexham to now waltz into the Premier League - although Coady stresses that is not the view from inside the club.

"If I was to say we'll get promoted I'd be silly to say something like that, [even though] the club has been on an incredible journey," he said.

Coady added: "I'd be stupid to sit here now and say we don't need to build and get better, because the journey the club has been on I respect it so much, they've done incredibly.

"Everyone in the club would say we are so close, we don't want to take a step back, but what we need to do now is build the right foundations now to take us to the next step - and that's what I'm loving being a part of.

"If we got ahead of ourselves of where we're at now because the club have signed a few players, or they club are saying they want to get here [the Premier League]... we do want to get there but we've got to make sure we're right when we do get there.

"That's what's so impressive about the club, we're not ahead of ourselves. We know where we are, we're so close to the next step but we've got to do it in the right way."

After their late loss at Southampton, conceding two goals in time added on, and the home defeat to the Baggies last weekend, Saturday's home game against a Sheffield Wednesday side also yet to get off the mark takes on an added significance.

"Both clubs will be looking at it thinking this is a big game for both teams, but certainly for us we're looking at the game thinking the quicker we can get that win [the better] to get up and running," Coady said.

"We should have beaten Southampton... we need to learn to see games out. Can we get on top in a game and take our chances when we're on top and finish it off? Can we not concede so many goals?

"I don't want it to be, 'oh, Wrexham are in the Championship, let's just enjoy the ride'."

Let's dive into the details: Salisbury (left) and Skupski (right) could become Britain's first triumphant ATP Finals doubles team

Great Britain's Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski will chase a slice of tennis history in Sunday's ATP Finals doubles trophy match - but a fellow Briton across the net will be out to stop them.

It has been said that the final will be the last outing as a team for Salisbury and Skupski, before they move on to new partners for 2026, and on that basis it presents an ideal chance for them to part ways on a high.

No British team have ever won the doubles title at the season-end event, although Salisbury has twice been a champion alongside American Rajeev Ram.

The wait could end in Turin, although British compatriot Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara should provide tough opposition.

At the very least, one British player will be able to celebrate after Sunday's showpiece.

Salisbury and Skupski beat Wimbledon champions Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash - another British pairing - to reach the final, prevailing in a match decided by fine margins.

It went Salisbury and Skupski's way by a 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 10-8 scoreline as serves dominated.

Former British number one Laura Robson, now working for Sky Sports, mentioned to Salisbury, 33, and Skupski, 35, in a post-match interview that the pair were splitting.

Neither denied it. The move would mean ending an alliance that lasted for just one season, in which they were runners-up at the French Open and US Open.

Asked if that factor would provide fuel for the final, when they will face opponents they beat in the round-robin stage on Wednesday, Skupski said: "It's just another match.

"It's been a long season. It's going to be a tough match against them boys.

"We're really looking forward to it. We're going to have to bring as much energy as possible, even though it's the last tournament of the year.

"We'll go out there, give it out best shot and see what happens."

Cash and Glasspool, the world's top-ranked doubles team, saved the only break point either team had in the opening set.

An early break in the second set allowed Salisbury and Skupski to haul themselves level and force a match tie-break, in which the crucial moment came when Glasspool netted an overhead to give up a mini-break.

Two match points were saved from 9-6 behind by the top seeds, but Skupski landed a strong first serve on the next opportunity and watched happily as the return landed wide.

Earlier, Patten and Heliovaara beat the all-Italian pair of Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori 6-4 6-3 in the first semi-final.

Victory continued a successful year for the former Wimbledon champions, who won the Australian Open in January for their second Grand Slam title together and have added titles in Beijing and Paris.

Patten has already made this a memorable trip to Turin, becoming engaged to girlfriend Ellie last Sunday.

Both teams of finalists have secured substantial winnings already this week, with unbeaten Skupski and Salisbury set to share a total pot of about Â£730,000 should they lift the trophy.

Patten and Heliovaara - having lost once in the round-robin stage - would collect about Â£660,000 if they take the title.

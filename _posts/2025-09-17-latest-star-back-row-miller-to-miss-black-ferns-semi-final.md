Experts revealed that Miller has been one of the stars of the tournament so far

Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final: Canada v New Zealand

Venue: Ashton Gate, Bristol Date: Friday 19 September Kick-off: 19:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Radio and BBC Sport website and app

Star flanker Jorja Miller will miss defending champions New Zealand's Rugby World Cup semi-final against Canada on Friday night in Bristol.

The 21-year-old, who converted from Sevens to earn selection for the Black Ferns' title defence, has scored four tries in four appearances so far in the tournament, impressing with her all-court style.

She went off early in the second half of her team's 46-17 quarter-final victory over South Africa in Exeter after playing with an apparent leg complaint.

Kennedy Tukuafu, who co-captained the team that won the World Cup on home soil three years ago, replaces Miller in one of four changes to the starting line-up.

Maia Joseph, the daughter of former All Black Jamie Joseph, who made her first start of the tournament against Ireland, gives way to Risi Pouri-Lane at scrum-half while Sylvia Brunt and Tanya Kalounivale come into the midfield and front row respectively.

Canada thrash Australia to set up New Zealand semi

Meanwhile Canada head coach Kevin Rouet has named an entirely unchanged matchday 23 in the wake of an impressive 46-5 win over Australia in the last eight.

Open-side flanker Karen Paquin, who scored the last of seven tries against the Wallaroos, is set to win her 50th cap, while Saracens' Sophie de Goede leads the side from second row.

Canada beat New Zealand for the first time in their history in May 2024, prevailing 22-19 in Christchurch, before following that win up with a 27-27 draw in their most recent meeting four months ago.

"We have shown over the past two years that we are one of the best teams in the world, and our last two results against New Zealand support that," said Rouet. "We have every reason to believe that we can win this game."

Either England or France await the winners in the final on 27 September at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium.

New Zealand: Holmes; Sorensen-McGee, Waaka, Brunt, Woodman-Wickliffe; Demant, Pouri-Lane; Viliko, Ponsonby, Kalounivale, Roos, A Bremner, Mikaele-Tu'u, Tukuakfu, Olsen-Baker.

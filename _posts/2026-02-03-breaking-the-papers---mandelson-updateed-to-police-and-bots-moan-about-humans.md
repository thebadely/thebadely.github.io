Let's dive into the details: Most of the front pages focus on the possibility of Lord Mandelson facing a police investigation after allegations he shared sensitive government information with Jeffrey Epstein. "Labour's dark lord now faces a criminal inquiry" is the Daily Mail's headline. "Cops called" says the Sun.

The Guardian says the latest disclosures saw MPs line up in parliament to express their fury. The Financial Times notes that Sir Keir Starmer tried to "limit the fallout" by promising to find a way to remove Peter Mandelson from the House of Lords, while announcing an official inquiry into the peer's conduct when he was a minister.

Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment about the latest allegations, but the Times runs an exclusive interview with him about his links more generally to Jeffrey Epstein. He is quoted as saying he was "too trusting" of the disgraced financier, and describes him as like "muck you can't get off your shoe".

Many of the editorials argue that Lord Mandelson's political career is now over. The Daily Express says his reputation is in "tatters". The Daily Mirror calls on him to "do what is honourable" and step down from the Lords. The Sun says he's "previously enjoyed more comebacks than Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Tiger Woods put together" but the full extent of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein is "so shocking that he must now be finished once and for all".

The Daily Telegraph reports on research which says cancer rates across Europe are rising among women under 50, but the trend is not being seen among men. The findings come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It says cases of early-onset cancer have risen by 16% among women aged below 50 since 2000 while the rate for men has stayed the same.

And some of the papers note that a fundraising drive to help to protect the Cerne Abbas Giant chalk figure in Dorset has reached its target in just 60 days. The Guardian says the National Trust has raised £330,000, with donations coming from 20 countries. The headline in the i Paper is "giant effort".

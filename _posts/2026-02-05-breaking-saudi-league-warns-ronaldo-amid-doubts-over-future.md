Experts revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 91 goals in 95 Saudi Pro League apperances for Al-Nassr

The Saudi Pro League has warned Cristiano Ronaldo "no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club" amid doubts over his future at Al-Nassr.

The Portugal forward, 41, was left out of Al-Nassr's squad for Monday's Saudi Pro League game against Al-Riyadh.

Portuguese outlet A Bola, external reported Ronaldo refused to play, having grown dissatisfied with how the club was being run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).

BBC Sport has been told former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's move to league leaders Al-Hilal from AlâIttihad earlier this week was the principle reason for Ronaldo's frustration at Al-Nassr.

French striker Benzema, 38, scored a hat-trick on his debut for Al-Hilal in a 6-0 win over Al-Okhdood on Thursday.

Both Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - the country's most successful club with 19 league titles - are among the teams controlled by the PIF, which also backs Newcastle United.

Ronaldo posted a picture of himself back in training on Wednesday, but Saudi Pro League officials are unsure if he will play against AlâIttihad on Friday.

What is going on with Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia?

In a statement issued to BBC Sport, a Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: "The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.

"Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.

"Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition," added the Saudi Pro League spokesperson. "Like any elite competitor, he wants to win.

"But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.

"Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters."

Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in 2022 after leaving Manchester United mid-season, becoming the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of Â£177m, but has only won the Arab Club Champions Cup with them.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a new two-year contract in June 2025.

Before he agreed the new deal, however, there was speculation he might leave Al-Nassr with a loan move to rivals Al-Hilal among those touted.

Al-Nassr only signed Iraq Under-23 midfielder Hayder Abdulkareem in the January transfer window.

Al-Hilal are unbeaten in the league this season and lead with 50 points after 20 games, while Al-Nassr are four points behind in third place, although they have a game in hand.

The Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: "The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.

"The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans."

Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano 3

Venue: Madison Square Garden, New York Date: Friday, 11 July

Coverage: Follow live text commentary from 01:00 BST on BBC Sport website & app

Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano step into the ring together for the third time on Friday at Madison Square Garden.

Irishwoman Taylor has two wins over Puerto Rico's Serrano but, after two incredibly close contests, we are being treated to a third instalment of the seminal rivalry in women's boxing.

Serrano, 36, will be hoping it is third time lucky and can make the necessary adjustments to turn the tide in her favour.

Taylor once again travels to face Serrano and they will fight at the scene of their first, classic encounter.

Will 39-year-old Taylor make it a clean sweep? Or can Serrano finally taste victory against her biggest rival?

BBC Sport asked the world of boxing for their predictions.

"Amanda's a warrior and we believe in her. She's been able to hurt Katie and hopefully this time she can get a stoppage. I think they're both really locked in. You can feel the respect but there's also hatred. I think they both have a lot to prove."

"There was a lot made of Katie's head coming in during their second fight, but it was just a result how how she fights rather than malicious. Still, she is going to need to be very careful with it this time as the referee will be on her and may be quick to deduct points. Katie may not be getting any younger and Serrano is a great fighter, but it's still 2-0 to Taylor and I feel she has Serrano's number."

"We saw how those first two fights went, but Amanda pulls this one out. She has New York behind her and is more prepared."

"This could be the best fight so far. With the style and Katie's age, and how Amanda performed in the last fight, I just think that Amanda comes through and wins mid-fight, towards the end. I think she comes on stronger and she gets the decision with the bigger shots and the workrate."

"I think Taylor will get the victory there. She's been a great servant for Irish sport and women's sport. I was lucky enough to have her watch one of my fights when I was in Las Vegas, and it was a privilege to meet her briefly. She's been an excellent advocate for boxing and I'll back her all the way."

"We lost the first two, but with a few little adjustments I think we can pull it off this time around."

"I'm going to go for Taylor. The first two fights were amazing and hopefully the third one lives up the expectation and hype. "

"It's not been going great for Serrano but they're just such good fights. I sometimes think they're going to have to give one to Serrano but I said that last time and Taylor took it, so you just can't bet against her. If I had to bet my house, I'd have to say Serrano but I'm rooting for Taylor. I'm such a huge fan."

"We know Amanda pretty well, they know us too. It will come down to who makes the little adjustments, who is in better shape in the later rounds and digs down when it comes down to it."

"Taylor is a great ambassador for women's boxing. She's already won twice so she has the experience to go out there and win on points. I'm going for a points win for Taylor."

"Katie Taylor, I reckon, wins again."

"I think it will be a repeat of the first two fights and Katie Taylor will win this one on points."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Marc Marquez won the 93rd race of his career in Italy

Marc Marquez won the Italian Grand Prix to extend his lead at the top of the riders' standings in MotoGP.

The Spaniard had already won Saturday's sprint race and secured a record-breaking 100th pole position to start Sunday's race from the front at the Mugello circuit.

From the very first corner Marquez, his brother Alex and home favourite Francesco Bagnaia swapped positions in a breathless start.

With Bagnaia tailing off the front two, Marc Marquez was able to regain the lead from his brother on lap nine and pulled away in the remainder of the race to take the chequered flag.

The 32-year-old Ducati rider now leads the championship by 40 points from Alex Marquez after securing his first victory in Italy since 2014.

"[It is] an amazing feeling," said Marc Marquez. "We are at a Ducati track and I know it's super special for them so [it's good] to have three Ducatis on the podium."

"From the beginning Francesco [Bagnaia] and Alex [Marquez] attacked me but I was calm and I am happy to take the deserved points."

Bagnaia was looking to make it four straight wins at his home grand prix but was beaten into third place by fellow Italian Fabio di Giannantonio.

The championship continues next weekend with the Dutch Grand Prix at Assen.

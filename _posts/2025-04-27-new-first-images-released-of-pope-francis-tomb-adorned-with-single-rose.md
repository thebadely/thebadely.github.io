According to new developments, Images of Pope Francis's tomb at the Santa Maria Maggiore church in Rome have been released.

A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight.

The late pope was laid to rest at the church - one of four major basilicas in the Italian capital, and one he would regularly visit during his time as cardinal and pontiff - in a private ceremony following his public funeral in the Vatican on Saturday.

Thousands of mourners have been filing past the tomb since the church opened to the public on Sunday morning to pay their respects to Pope Francis, who died aged 88 on Monday.

Among them was Rosario Correale, an Italian, who said it was "very emotional" seeing the tomb. "He really left a mark on us," he told the Associated Press.

Polish pilgrim Maria Brzezinska felt the resting place befit the man. "I feel like it's exactly in the way of the Pope. He was simple, and so is his place now," she told the news agency Reuters after visiting.

Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century.

The basilica sits near the Colosseum, a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station - well beyond the limits of the Vatican, where popes are traditionally entombed.

But it was one the South American pontiff had a long-held affinity for.

Its senior priest previously told an Italian newspaper that Pope Francis had said he wished to be laid to rest there in 2022, citing inspiration from the Virgin Mary.

"I thought it was amazing that he wanted to be buried here in this basilica," Amaya Morris, another pilgrim, told AP. 

"Out of all of the [churches], he chose this one. So I thought that was really amazing. It's really humbling to be able to be here."

Francis's funeral was attended by heads of state, heads of government and monarchs from around the world - as well as hundreds of thousands of Catholics who lined the streets leading to the Vatican to pay their respects.

Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, before 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re gave a homily on the pope's legacy.

The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to "build bridges, not walls".

The funeral was also the venue for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, which the latter said afterwards had the "potential to become historic".

Trump later questioned Russian President Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the now three-year war in Ukraine, a conflict which Pope Francis had regularly called for peace during his papacy.

Following the public funeral, Pope Francis's coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession.

Authorities said 140,000 people had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse - a repurposed white popemobile - crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia.

After a period of mourning, attention will soon turn to the selection of the next pope.

A date has not yet been set but it is thought it could start as early as 5 or 6 May, with 135 cardinals set to attend, making it the largest conclave in modern history.

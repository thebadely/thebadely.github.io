Let's dive into the details: A man has been arrested at Manchester Airport on suspicion of terror offences over the synagogue attack in the city earlier this year, police have said. 

Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz died at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on 2 October in the attack by Jihad Al-Shamie, who was shot dead by police, while three other men were treated in hospital for serious injuries.

A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism after arriving on an inbound flight earlier, Greater Manchester Police said.

The arrest brings the total number of people arrested in connection with the attack to seven.

Five of those have been released without charge, but a 30-year-old man arrested on 9 October on suspicion of failing to disclose information under the Terrorism Act remains on bail.

The opening of inquest proceedings last month heard Al-Shamie drove his car into a security guard outside the synagogue as people were gathering for Yom Kippur, before getting out and attacking Mr Cravitz with a knife. 

Congregants inside the building, including Mr Daulby, managed to shut the doors and held them closed as Al-Shamie tried to batter his way inside.

Manchester Coroner's Court heard armed officers opened fire on Al-Shamie, but a stray bullet penetrated the door of the synagogue and fatally struck Mr Daulby in the chest. 

Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts of Counter Terrorism Policing North West said the families of Mr Cravitz and Mr Daulby, as well as victims who survived serious injuries, had been informed of the latest arrest. 

He added: "Our investigation is continuing, and I would once again appeal for anyone with information that they think could assist our enquiries to please come forward. 

"We are also still seeking to identify and speak to anyone who was present at the time of the incident or the immediate aftermath so that we can ensure they have access to all the welfare support options that are available to witnesses."

Last month Rabbi Daniel Walker, who alongside his congregants held the doors of the synagogue shut, said the empty seats where Mr Daulby and Mr Cravitz used to sit were one of the "first things I see" whenever he entered the building.

"They were both very, very special men," he told the BBC.

"Adrian was a very quiet man - a man of great dignity, always with a smile, always kind, very much loved by his family and his neighbours.

"Melvin was also a wonderful man - a family man."

Let's dive into the details: Most newspapers lead on the Iran-Israel crisis. 

"All-Out War" is the main headline for the Daily Mail. 

The front pages of both the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mirror focus on Tehran's retaliatory strikes on Tel Aviv, featuring photographs of a "fireball" and plumes of smoke in the sky. 

The Times carries an image of missiles being intercepted over the city.

The Guardian says the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that his country's attacks on Iran, targeting Tehran's nuclear programme, are "just the beginning".

The i Weekend offers more details on the Israeli strikes. 

The paper says videos released by Israel's military appear to show agents launching drone attacks from within Iranian territory. 

The Times carries a similar report, saying the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, set up a secret drone base in advance in Iran.

According to the Telegraph, there are hopes the flickering lights seen by the sole survivor of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad could help to reveal the cause of the disaster. 

The British man who managed to escape the wreckage has spoken of how green and white lights in the cabin turned on and off shortly before impact. 

Experts have suggested this points to problems with the plane's engine.

And many of the papers reflect on the King's birthday honours. 

"Proper Posh" is how Daily Mirror sums up the news that David Beckham is to be knighted. 

And a couple of the front pages celebrate the fact that the 18-year-old darts sensation Luke Littler is being awarded an MBE. 

The Daily Star jokes that the initials should stand for Master of the Bulls Eye. 

The Sun's headline is "Luke who got a gong".

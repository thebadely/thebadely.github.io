Martinelli scores hat-trick as Arsenal beat Portsmouth

From being branded an "idiot" to scoring a hat-trick, Gabriel Martinell's name has been in the headlines over the past few days.

The Arsenal winger was heavily criticised for trying to push the injured Conor Bradley off the pitch in the closing stages of Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Liverpool on Thursday, something he apologised for on social media.

But the 24-year-old's first hat-trick for Arsenal - as they came from behind to beat Championship outfit Portsmouth and reach the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday - showed "personality", according to his boss.

"It's part of football and then it's how you take it," Mikel Arteta when asked how Martinelli has dealt with being the subject of so much discussion.

"But he knew inside the reason why he did what he did."

Arteta also praised Liverpool boss Arne Slot for his considered response to the incident, when he defended the Brazilian.

"I think Arne Slot spoke brilliantly after the game - speaking of your opponent in the manner that he explained the situation and the fact that Gabi had no intention whatsoever to damage any player," added Arteta.

"That's personality. Come in and talk on the pitch, which is the best part of it." 

Martinelli has had a mixed season, losing his starting place in the Premier League to Leandro Trossard after a drop in form and confidence.

He has started just six times for the Gunners, who are six points clear at the top of the table.

However, the winger has been a key player this season for Arsenal in Champions League, scoring five goals in as many appearances. And after his hat-trick against Portsmouth, he is now his side's top scorer. 

"That's why to play for a big club, you need a big personality because it can be bad... it can be an action that you miss, it can be something that costs you a game," Arteta added

"And three days later, there is a game. So you need to lift yourself up and make it count.

"I love it. Gabi, in every context that you throw him in, he plays, he doesn't play. He performs well, not well. Today, he scored three goals.

"Tomorrow, he's going to train 100 miles an hour, for sure. He's not going to change that. And that's Gabi."

Martinelli's hat-trick was the first scored by an Arsenal player in the FA Cup since Theo Walcott did so against Southampton in January 2017.

It was also his first in 249 games for the Gunners and the first time that he has scored more than two goals in a game for a year. 

Arteta was not surprised that Martinelli, who is not known for his aerial ability, was able to score twice with his head from corners as "his timing in the box is really good".

Arsenal are well-known for their threat from set-pieces since the appointment of coach Nicolas Jover. They have scored 17 goals from corners in all competitions this season; the most by any Premier League team.

But even by the Gunners' impressive standards, scoring three in a game is a rare occurrence - this was the first time they had done so since May 2022 against Everton.

The game against Portsmouth was the first of four away games in four different competitions for Arsenal - with tests in the Carabao Cup, Premier League and Champions League to come. 

They are hoping to end their wait for a trophy - with their last coming when Arteta led them to the 2020 FA Cup, where they beat Portsmouth on the way to lifting the cup. 

Arsenal are in a strong position - top of both the Premier League and Champions League tables - while they have won nine of their 10 matches in cup competitions this season, including all five away from home, drawing once.

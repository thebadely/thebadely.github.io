Let's dive into the details: Donald Trump's promise to protestors in Iran that "help is on the way" is the main story for the Daily Telegraph. The paper says it's spoken to medics in Tehran who say the healthcare system is buckling amid mass casualties and chronic understaffing. It quotes one doctor as saying: "There are rivers of blood in hospitals here."

The Guardian says Trump's remarks are the clearest sign yet that he may be preparing for military action against Tehran.

The government's U-turn on making digital ID cards "mandatory" for people who want to work is the lead in the Times. The paper says the prime minister had previously put migration at the heart of the rationale for the cards, but there were concerns about the cost and complexity of the scheme.

It quotes one government source as saying they didn't want to risk there being cases of a "65-year-old in a rural area being barred from working because he hasn't downloaded this app". Another source source said the government "remained committed" to a requirement that right-to-work checks are carried out digitally.

The Mirror leads with details of Northern Powerhouse Rail, the £45bn programme which will include new rail lines built to Manchester and upgrades to services in West Yorkshire. The paper says ministers are also expected to promise a new version of HS2's axed leg between Birmingham and Manchester.

The i Paper warns there is only £1.1bn of firm funding in place for the project, and no start or completion date yet.

The impact of the Budget on pubs is the focus for the Sun. It says drinkers will be paying 4p more for a pint for Guinness from April, and that other drinks will have their alcohol content reduced because of next month's rise in alcohol duty.

The paper says it's a "double whammy" for the hospitality industry after the chancellor raised business rates for pubs as well. A Treasury spokesperson said it was determined to support the Great British pub. The Sun's headline calls Rachel Reeves: "The Inn Reaper."

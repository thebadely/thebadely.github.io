New Zealand claim top spot in Pool C with win over Ireland

South Africa have made 10 changes to their starting XV to face world champions New Zealand in what will be their first Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final.

Captain Nolusindiso Booi, 40, returns for Saturday's game in Exeter after missing the 57-10 defeat by France on Sunday.

Prop Sanelisiwe Charlie, hooker Lindelwa Gwala, lock Danelle Lochne and flanker Sizophila Solontsi all come back into the pack as well.

In the backs, fly-half Libbie Janse van Rensburg, centre Zintle Mpupha and wing Ayanda Malinga, who scored twice in the win against Brazil, are all recalled.

Head coach Swys de Bruin has gone for the bold tactic of choosing seven forwards on the bench to replicate men's coach Rassie Erasmus' selection when the Springboks defeated the All Blacks in the 2023 World Cup final.

Utility back Eloise Webb is the only back named among the replacements.

"We like the physical stuff, we back our strength and we feel it's the right thing to do," De Bruin said.

The Springbok Women will appear in the knockout stages for the first time after defeating Brazil and Italy.

Having already qualified, De Bruin opted to rest many of his regular starters last weekend.

The Black Ferns, who have won the past two World Cups, have made four changes and one positional switch from the side that hammered Ireland in Brighton.

Kaipo Olsen-Baker returns at number eight, while Liana Mikaele-Tu'u moves to blind-side flanker.

Prop Veisinia Mahutariki-Fakalelu replaces Tanya Kalounivale, with Maia Joseph named at scrum-half instead of Risi Pouri-Lane.

Centre Theresa Setefano also comes into the side in place of Sylvia Brunt, who suffered a head injury against Ireland.

Teenage wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee has scored back-to-back hat-tricks in the tournament and retains her spot, while Women's Sevens Player of the Year Jorja Miller, 21, continues at open-side flanker over co-captain Kennedy Tukuafu.

Asked about whether she would like to score a third straight hat-trick, Sorensen-McGee said: "If it comes, then yes. I'm not going to try and force it, just take the game as it comes, and if it happens it happens."

Allan Bunting's side, who are one of the favourites for the tournament, comfortably topped Pool C and are strongly favoured to win at Sandy Park.

"I think the pressure if you're underdogs is on them. There's nothing on us. I've seen with these ladies, if you put the bar there they push it higher. They are unreal if it comes to challenging them," De Bruin added.

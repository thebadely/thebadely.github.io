Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Supermarket chain Aldi has given a Mancunian twist to its sign on its nearest store to where Oasis will play their homecoming gigs as a celebration of "the local dialect and the legendary band".

The Prestwich branch on Bury New Road has changed its name to "Aldeh" to reflect Manchester's distinctive drawl and the Mancunian pronunciation of its name, the firm said.

Liam and Noel Gallagher have reunited for their 2025 tour, which includes five sold out gigs in Heaton Park from 11 July.

The Manchester band disbanded 16 years ago following a backstage brawl between the brothers at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris.

Oasis's tour will start on Friday in Cardiff before finishing in Brazil in November.

The supermarket said the name change in Prestwich would remain in place during the gigs in Heaton Park.

Aldi's chief commercial officer Julie Ashfield said by temporarily renaming the store, "we're celebrating both the local dialect and the legendary band that has brought so much joy to fans worldwide".

Last year, Lidl put up a spoof blue plaque at its Newton Heath store, reflecting Liam Gallagher's claim he would gig at the store if shows at the Co-op Live arena could not go ahead, amid teething troubles at the venue when it first opened.

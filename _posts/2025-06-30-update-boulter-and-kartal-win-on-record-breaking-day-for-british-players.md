'Clinical' Kartal sees off 20th ranked Ostapenko in first-round upset - highlights

Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal both produced impressive victories at either end of a record-breaking day for British players at Wimbledon.

Former British number one Boulter took to Centre Court in the evening and secured a rare victory over a top 10 player as she beat Spain's Paula Badosa 6-2 3-6 6-4. 

Earlier, Kartal was the first player through from the 14-strong British contingent in action on day one with victory over 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko.

In total, seven Britons in the men's and women's draw progressed to the second round on day one, making it the most successful day for British players at Wimbledon in the Open era. 

Boulter, 28, and Kartal were joined by British number one Emma Raducanu - who beat compatriot Mimi Xu - Cameron Norrie, Arthur Fery, Oliver Tarvet and Billy Harris.

"It's incredible with so many Brits in the draw," Raducanu, 22, said.

"I think it's great for the spectators, too, to have so many Brits to follow in the draw.  As we win matches, it's more and more exciting."

Boulter, who will face Argentine lucky loser Solana Sierra next, said: "Centre Court Wimbledon, as a Brit, against a top-10 player, for me doesn't get that much better.

"It is one of the reasons why I do play tennis, to win matches like that, and to have a go at the best in the world. 

"I do feel like it is one of the best [wins] for sure in my career."

On a sweltering day at SW19, Kartal toppled the former French Open champion 7-5 2-6 6-2 to book her place in the second round.

Kartal, 23, was one of 10 British women in action at the All England Club - the most since 1992.

She had to come from behind to win the opening set on a lively court three.

But a dominant deciding set secured her progression to round two for the second time in her career, following a breakout tournament at last year's Wimbledon where she reached the third round.

"That was by far one of the toughest matches I've played," she said after the win, her third over a top-20 player this year.

"I would say I struggle against the big hitters. I've made a conscious effort this year to play the bigger matches and put myself under the most pressure out on court. 

"I knew I wouldn't get the results straight away but that it would eventually pay off, and that's what happened today."

GB's Boulter battles to big win over Badosa

This is the sixth successive time Boulter has reached the second round at Wimbledon, but this was one of her best opening-round wins against a tricky opponent, having only beaten a top-10 opponent three times before.

Badosa is a former world number two but her recent struggles with injuries will have given Boulter hope of getting a result, something that looked likely in a first set she dominated.

Badosa had to withdraw from the Berlin Open earlier this month at the quarter-final stage because of a back injury and it appeared that may have still been a concern as she was twice broken in the opener.

But it was a different story in the second set as Badosa showed her top 10 qualities, attacking Boulter on her serve to secure two breaks on her way to levelling matters.

An absorbing third set had the Centre Court crowd enthralled, with Badosa, 27, getting a break in the first game but Boulter broke back immediately.

From then on there was little to separate the two before Boulter got the decisive break at 5-4 to seal the win.

Kartal has enjoyed a remarkable rise through the rankings in the past 18 months.

At Wimbledon last year, she arrived as a wildcard ranked 281 in the world and went on to reach the third round.

On her return this year, ranked 230 places above that, she cut a calm and mature figure.

Ostapenko, 28, had beaten Kartal comfortably in the opening round at Eastbourne last week but the Briton maintained her composure as she fell 5-2 behind in the opening set.

A wayward Ostapenko forehand into the net was the catalyst for Kartal to go on and win the next five games, saving set points at 5-4 before motoring ahead to take the set.

Ostapenko was left stunned when Kartal sent a ripping forehand round the net post but the former Wimbledon semi-finalist managed to cut out the errors and take the second set comfortably to level things up.

That said, Ostapenko grew increasingly frustrated throughout the match - muttering under her breath and berating herself while shouting up at her coaches.

Fans in the crowd were also on the receiving end of glaring looks as she complained that they were being too noisy, asking the umpire to tell them to be quiet before shouting at them and raising her arms in exasperation.

But throughout that Kartal remained steadfast and raced through the third set, securing a double break before serving out for an impressive victory.

A total of 23 Britons had qualified for Wimbledon in the men's and women's singles at the All England Club - the most since 1984.

While Raducanu, Boulter and Kartal progressed, there were exits for Harriet Dart, Hannah Klugman and Mika Stojsavljevic in the women's draw.

Dart won the first set of her match against Hungary's Dalma Galfi but went on to lose 3-6 6-3 7-5.

Teenager Klugman lost to Canada's 29th seed Leylah Fernandez 6-1 6-3 on her Grand Slam main-draw debut.

The 16-year-old, who last month became the first Briton in almost 50 years to reach the French Open girls' final, was one of three British players aged 17 and under in the women's singles draw at the All England Club.

Stojsavljevic, also 16, was beaten 6-3 6-2 by American Ashlyn Krueger.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Middle East features on almost all of the front pages, with the Daily Mirror calling today a "moment of truth" for Gaza. It says Israel and the Palestinians are "on the cusp of a precarious peace", but that there are fears one wrong move will spell disaster. The Guardian calls the freeing of the last living hostages "a key step" to ending the Gaza war. The Sun calls today "Freedom Day", while for the Daily Mail it's a "day of destiny".

The Daily Telegraph has a photograph of US President Donald Trump on its front page, giving a thumbs up as he boarded Air Force One last night to fly to the Middle East. The i Paper describes the meeting in Egypt later today as a "historic summit", which will look to agree a longer term peace deal. The Times says the international leaders gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh will signal global support for the "far trickier" next stage of the negotiations. It say those talks will deal with "fraught" issues, such as Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza.

The Guardian says a number of charities, including those representing refugees and asylum seekers, are warning that "toxic rhetoric" around immigration and race has led to growing abuse of their staff. Threats have become more explicit since the riots which followed the Southport attacks, with the charities saying they are having to introduce tougher security measures to protect volunteers and property.

UK relations with China remain under the microscope, with the Times saying Beijing was given assurances in advance that Labour would "progress" its planning application for a new super-embassy in London. It reports MPs warned approving the embassy risked further emboldening Beijing after the failure to prosecute two alleged Chinese spies. The Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives want to force a debate in the Commons on the spying case, so ministers have to answer questions. 

The Financial Times reports MI5 is stepping up its work with some of the UK's largest companies, about how to prevent or deal with cyber attacks. It says ministers are questioning if firms are prepared, raising concerns about the ripple effects through supply chains after an attack, as was seen with Jaguar Land Rover.

British fans of sumo wrestling have been warned about the dangers of getting too close to contests, according to the Daily Telegraph. A major five-day tournament starts at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Wednesday and the venue's website warns spectators accept the best seats "entirely at their own risk", which include being squashed by falling wrestlers and getting hit by salt and sand thrown from the ring.

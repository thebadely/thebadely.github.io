England's dramatic Euro 2025 final victory against Spain was the most watched television moment of the year so far, with a peak live audience of 12.2 million across all BBC platforms.

Sarina Wiegman's side retained their title by defeating the world champions on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Basel, Switzerland.

Chloe Kelly, who had scored the extra-time winner in the Euro 2022 final against Germany at Wembley, converted the decisive spot-kick to seal victory, while England keeper Hannah Hampton saved two Spain penalties. 

The Lionesses' victory peaked at 11.6 million on BBC One - 59% of all TV audiences - in a match also shown on ITV.

Coverage across the BBC and ITV attracted a combined peak TV audience of 16.2 million, with an average of 12 million viewers watching the match from start to finish. 

There were an additional 4.2 million streams of the match on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, while BBC Sport's live page had 11.4 million views.

Overall, the BBC's TV coverage of the tournament reached an audience of 22.1 million and there were 231 million total views across BBC Sport's social media accounts.

"This final was a landmark moment in sporting history," said BBC director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski.

"The kind of moment people will remember exactly where they were when they watched it.

"The incredible Lionesses took us on an emotional rollercoaster, and millions were hooked on BBC coverage from start to finish - from live streaming post-match analysis to millions following our live page and younger audiences in huge numbers on social media."

According to new developments, A plan offering thousands of households in Kent on low incomes help with cost of living pressures has been renewed for another year.

Medway Council approved a refresh of its crisis response, which has been helping residents since it was introduced in July 2023.

The plan identifies and provides advice and financial support for people struggling with housing, energy, water and other essentials, according to the authority.

Council leader Vince Maple said: "It's something I wish didn't have to exist, but thank goodness it does whilst there is still absolutely a need."

Maple said that as long as it was necessary, the plan would be updated every year.

A report, which went before cabinet members on Tuesday, outlined how 1,537 pensioner households that missed out on receiving pension credit and the winter fuel payment were identified in late 2024-25 and given £200 from the household support fund.

The authority's benefits and financial welfare service also assisted more than 1,000 households with financial guidance and support through its financial welfare hub.

A further 24,300 individuals and 1,350 families were given food parcels and hot meals every month, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

The council said it also managed to help 314 households avoid having to use emergency accommodation due to investing in extra staff who helped rough sleepers.

One of the new additions to the plan is a discounted entry for The Historic Dockyard Chatham for those on Universal Credit – reducing the price to £2.

Maple added: "Even when times are tough, particularly during the summer holidays, we recognise it's about living, not surviving."

The council also agreed to reinvest in the ReferKent system, which helps refer people to organisations which help with issues including loan sharks and addiction.

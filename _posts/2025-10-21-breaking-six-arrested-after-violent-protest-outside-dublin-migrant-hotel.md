Experts revealed that Six people have been arrested after Irish police were attacked with bricks, fireworks and glass bottles at a protest outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Dublin.

A police vehicle was also set on fire at the Citywest Hotel, in Saggart, on Tuesday evening. A line of riot police prevented the protesters getting to the hotel.

Gardaí (Irish police) said protesters attempted to breach the police cordon by charging the line with horse-drawn sulkies (carts). Some carried garden forks and tools, while others damaged walls to get missiles.

The police helicopter was targeted with lasers, and one officer received medical attention for a foot injury.

Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly said: "The actions can only be described as thuggery. This was a mob intent on violence against gardaí.

"I utterly condemn the attacks on gardaí who did their jobs professionally and with great courage to keep people safe."

He said about 300 officers were on duty, with about half from the public order unit. A water cannon was deployed, as well as officers on horseback and a dog unit.

Broadcaster RTÉ reported that several thousand people had gathered near the hotel.

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin said there could be no justification for attacks on police.

"There can be no justification for the vile abuse against them, or the attempted assaults and attacks on members of the force that will shock all right-thinking people," he said.

"I pay tribute to the frontline gardaí (Irish police) who acted courageously and quickly to restore order."

Ireland's Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan said there was "no excuse" for the violent scenes.

He added: "This is unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the gardaí. Those involved will be brought to justice. 

"It is clear to me from talking to colleagues that this violence does not reflect the people of Saggart. They are not the people participating in this criminality, but rather the people sitting at home in fear of it."

Speaking during the final Irish presidential debate on Tuesday, Heather Humphreys described the violence as "absolutely awful".

"This is not what we are as a country," she said.

The other presidential candidate, Catherine Connolly, said the scenes in Saggart were "very upsetting".

She added that "we need to be careful in this country" about the divisions emerging.

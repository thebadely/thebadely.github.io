It has been recently reported that The number of passengers passing through UK airports will be the most ever seen on any Christmas Eve since records began in 1972, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said.

It projects over 335,000 people will be flying in the UK on Wednesday, which is up 5% from Christmas Eve in 2024, though minimal disruption is expected.

Britain's roads are also expected to see one of the busiest Christmas Eves since records began said the RAC, though another motoring lobby says traffic peaks for the season have passed.

The RAC said the worst time to travel on Wednesday is from 1pm to 7pm as millions hit the road to get home before Christmas Day on Thursday, with delays expected on major routes.

Manchester airport said on Christmas Eve it expects around 75,000 passengers passing through, with 208 flights leaving the UK, but that number will halve on Christmas Day. Its most popular destinations on Christmas Eve are Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin.

Heathrow meanwhile says it is expecting its busiest December period ever, including 152,000 passengers using it on Christmas Day. EasyJet said 558 flights will depart on Christmas Day, part of "its busiest festive season ever".

Stansted Airport said Christmas Day for it, meanwhile, will be relatively quiet.

The busiest single day of the festive period for air travel was Friday 19 December.

The RAC meanwhile said particular tight spots on the roads will be the clockwise northern and western sections of the M25 from mid-morning, and the M5 north from Gloucestershire towards the West Midlands later in the afternoon.

While millions will travel by rail, earlier last-train times mean many may take to the road, making them even more congested. 

Several rail routes will be restricted or closed over the Christmas period for maintenance.

National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.

National Express coaches says it is running on Christmas day to 96 destinations.

The RAC's mobile servicing and repair's team leader Nick Mullender said 2025 was "looking to be the busiest getaway period since our records began" in 2013.

He said this year's Christmas Eve would be the busiest, with workers saving on annual leave days and  heading off on getaways at the last minute.

Meanwhile the AA, which provides traffic updates across the UK, said 19 December was the busiest part of the season.

For Christmas Eve, it warned the M27 will close in both directions between Junction 9 (Whiteley/Park Gate) and Junction 11 (Fareham East/Gosport) from 8pm until 4am on 4 January for major works at Junction 10.

This closure affects road journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth.

Drivers are advised to check tyres, expect delays and ensure oil and coolant levels are correct. It expected a rise in breakdowns as the weather becomes colder and 4.2 million journeys will be taken on roads.

*All timings are subject to change

Michael Dunlop set a new record for TT wins last year by taking his tally to 29 and is strongly fancied to add to that total this year as he takes part in all eight solo races.

The 36-year-old switches from Honda to BMW this year for the Superbike, Senior and Superstock races and to a Ducati V2 for the Supersport races, of which he has won a record 13 and the past six runnings.

The Northern Ireland rider has previously won races on BMW, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Paton machinery so a potential success for the Italian manufacturer in the Supersport races would add another marque to that list and give Ducati their first TT win since 1995.

He warmed up for the TT by claiming a hat-trick at the recent North West 200.

Peter Hickman again campaigns BMW, Triumph and Yamaha machinery in the various classes, with his 1,000cc efforts this year coming under the banner of the 8TEN Racing team, after ending his association with FHO Racing.

The Lincolnshire rider, a 14-time winner, took just one triumph last year, in the Superbike class, along with three second places in the Supertwins (two) and the Superstock.

The 38-year-old is the absolute lap record holder, with a lap speed of 136.358mph achieved on his Superstock BMW in 2023.

Davey Todd took his maiden TT victory in the Superstock class 12 months ago and followed that up with a triumph in the blue riband Senior. 

Another treble winner at the NW200, the Yorkshireman is Hickman's team-mate and co-owner with their 8TEN Racing team on BMWs, and campaigns a Honda and a Paton in the Supersports and Supertwins respectively for Padgett's Racing. 

Three-time winner Dean Harrison is in his second year with Honda Racing for all the 'big bike' races. plus the Supersport category, and will aim for more strong finishes after already accumulating 30 podium finishes to date, three of those wins. His last victory came in the 2019 Senior.

Other names to look out for include two-time British Superbike champion Josh Brookes, who is competing in a third straight TT for the first time, 23-time TT winner John McGuinness, Conor Cummins, Ian Hutchinson, James Hillier, Paul Jordan, Mike Browne and David Johnson.

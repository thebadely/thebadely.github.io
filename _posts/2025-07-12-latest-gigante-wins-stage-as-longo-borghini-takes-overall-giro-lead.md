According to new developments, Sarah Gigante won her second stage of the 2025 Women's Giro D'Italia

Australia's Sarah Gigante won the penultimate stage of the Women's Giro d'Italia while Elisa Longo Borghini claimed the pink jersey as the overall leader.

Gigante broke away from the chasing pack on the final climb of the 150km route from Fermignano to Monte Nerone to catch stage leader Longo Borghini with three kilometres to go.

The 24-year-old then powered away to win stage seven by 45 seconds from Italy's Longo Borghini, who finished second and gained enough time to take over the race lead from Marlen Reusser.

"I'm very grateful to my team - we stuck to the plan," said Gigante, whose second stage win of the 2025 Giro saw her move up to third place in the general classification.

"We really wanted to try something, and winning this stage is fantastic.

"I had studied the final climb and decided to attack on the steep section. I wanted to show that stage four-win wasn't just a one-off, but that I came to Italy to achieve great results," said Gigante, who trails Longo Borghini by one minute 11 seconds overall.

"I'm still a bit far back in the general classification, but I'll give it a go tomorrow," she added.

Defending champion Longo Borghini leads Swiss rider Marlen Reusser, who finished fourth on the stage, by 22 seconds.

Sunday's final stage is a 130km route between ForlÃ¬ and Imola.

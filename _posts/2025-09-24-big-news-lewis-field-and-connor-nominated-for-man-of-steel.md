It has been recently reported that Hull KR's Mikey Lewis (left) won the Steve Prescott Man of Steel award last year and is joined in this year's shortlist by Wigan's Jai Field (centre) and Leeds' Jake Connor (right)

Hull KR's Mikey Lewis, Wigan Warriors' Jai Field and Leeds Rhinos' Jake Connor have been nominated for the 2025 Steve Prescott Man of Steel award.

The three have been shortlisted for the award having sealed a play-off spot with their sides, in addition to being named in this season's Super League Dream Team.

Robins half-back Lewis, 24, won the award in 2024 and could be the first player to retain the crown after Paul Sculthorpe won in 2001 and 2002.

He has helped Hull KR to the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield this season.

Full-back Field, 28, guided last year's quadruple winners Wigan to second position in the regular season, while 30-year-old scrum-half Connor is nominated having had an inspired campaign with Leeds, as they sealed a top-four spot for the first time since 2017.

The award, which was named after the late Steve Prescott in 2014, has been running since 1977 when Leeds hooker David Ward received the inaugural trophy.

This year's trio were shortlisted after a process where a panel of former players award players points per game during the season using a voting system.

The Man of Steel crown, as well as the Woman of Steel and Wheels of Steel prizes, will be presented on Tuesday, 7 October in Manchester.

Wigan claim all three Woman of Steel nominations

Lewis's nomination comes as his career goes from strength to strength, continuing his fine form after a monumental 2024 season which saw him win the Man of Steel award for the first time and become the first KR player to be win the award since Gavin Miller in 1986.

Having made his England debut in 2023 against Tonga, he also looks set to start for his country in the upcoming Ashes Test series against Australia in October and November.

Field is named in the shortlist off the back of a prolific campaign for Wigan, scoring very nearly a try a game with a total of 26 tries from 27 fixtures in 2025 so far.

Connor will kick start his play-off campaign this weekend as his Leeds Rhinos side take on St Helens on Saturday evening in the second play-off eliminator of 2025.

Should Connor win the award, he would become the first Leeds player to be named Man of Steel since Zak Hardaker in 2015.

This year's Women of Steel award will go to a Wigan player after the Women's Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield winners enjoyed a clean sweep of nominations.

Jenna Foubister, Eva Hunter and Isabel Rowe were nominated for this year's award which is also set to be announced at the end-of-season awards in October.

Meanwhile, the shortlist for this season's Wheels of Steel, awarded to the best player in the Wheelchair Super League, will be announced on Thursday.

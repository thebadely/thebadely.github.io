Experts revealed that Manor Solomon has 44 caps for Israel

Tottenham are in regular contact with winger Manor Solomon after the midfielder was left stranded in Israel because of the ongoing conflict with Iran.

The 25-year-old Israel international married long-term partner Dana Voshina in his homeland last Thursday. 

However, the couple have been unable to leave the country after the Israeli military closed airspace to civilian traffic following aerial attacks from Iran last week. 

Solomon, who spent last season on loan at Leeds United, is due to return to pre-season training with Spurs in early July.

"We are constantly in regular dialogue with all our players regarding their wellbeing and welfare," a Tottenham spokesperson said.

The midfielder joined Spurs from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2023 but made just six appearances for the club before a season-ending knee injury.

After 12 months on loan at Fulham, Solomon joined Leeds United on a season-long loan deal in 2024.

He scored 10 times in 39 Championship matches last season as Leeds were promoted back into the Premier League. 

Solomon married partner Voshina last Thursday - 24 hours before Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites. 

The two countries have been exchanging airborne attacks ever since.

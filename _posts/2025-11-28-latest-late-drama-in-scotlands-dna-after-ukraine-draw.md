Watch the goals as Scotland earn draw against Ukraine

When Maria McAneny smashed home her last-gasp debut goal to salvage a draw for Scotland against Ukraine, head coach Melissa Andreatta bellowed "we never stop".

The clock had struck 95 minutes and the Scots seemed resigned to a meek defeat in a match they dominated, without doing much in front of goal.

But, when goalkeeper Sandy MacIver was thrown up for a Caroline Weir corner, for the ball to then bounce around like a game of pinball, McAneny was there to thump in an equaliser after Georgia Brown's hit was parried into her path.

While it saved what would have been a pretty unpleasant inquest of a game which lacked quality, it exhibited Scotland's never-say-die attitude, which appears to be amplified under Andretta's stewardship. 

Last month, it was Weir's 90th-minute wonder-strike that sealed the Australian's first win as boss, while the Real Madrid midfielder found the net in her hometown in the 93rd minute against Switzerland.

"It's a Scottish mindset, I'm just adding to it and really shining a light on it," the head coach told BBC Scotland in Jerez.

"I love it because it's part of my DNA too, that we never stop, we're always there to the end."

Who knows what the football gods are playing at with all this late drama in Scotland internationals, but they could save us all a few years if they showed a bit of kindness. 

Andreatta said earlier in the week her players were "inspired" by the heroics of Steve Clarke's side and wanted to match their achievement of reaching the World Cup in 2027.

That official journey will begin in March when Group B4 - with Belgium, Israel and Luxembourg - gets underway, but this friendly against Ukraine, and Tuesday's against China, was to ensure they entered that campaign in the best shape.

This was more of a damp squib.

Hopes were higher following the thrilling seven-goal show against the Swiss last month. Although it ended in defeat, the display in Dunfermline was disciplined while the Scots delivered an attacking performance that had punters off their seats.

Watchers on in Jerez didn't have such excitement and could instead focus on topping up their tan in the searing heat.

"I think in the first 30 minutes of the first half, we were really dominant and good with the ball," Andreatta said.

"Then we lost our way a little bit and forced things into their shape, and it cost us. Good teams, teams that are in form, are going to hurt you.

"The quality of our final pass with numbers in the box to convert our chances [is something we need to work on improve on]. 

"Converting chances is the hardest part of the game, but it's something that the girls are aware of and know that we're making steps forward to improve that."

In Andreatta's two previous camps, Kathleen McGovern has done a heap of good work on that front.

The Hibernian forward scored the first goal of the Australian's reign in the draw in the Netherlands, before finding the net at East End Park too.

The 23-year-old is the sort of striker Scotland have been yearning for. Andreatta even called her "a beast" in the aftermath of the action in Dunfermline.

She was forced to pull out of the trip to the south of Spain with injury, but it opened the door for the uncapped McAneny to be promoted from the under-23s.

Andreatta asked the Celtic midfielder to bring "more of the same" on her first meeting with the A-squad after an impressive start to the season at both club and country level.

Even before her goal, the 21-year-old showed gumption.

Tearing down the left, she linked up well with the ever-energetic Kirsty Hanson before a crisp cross from out on the right led to Andreatta switching her flanks for the final few minutes.

She was positioned perfectly in the middle of the congested box to fire in. Precision paid off amid a sizeable stramash.

"I was just hoping I didn't send it into the stands," McAneny admitted.

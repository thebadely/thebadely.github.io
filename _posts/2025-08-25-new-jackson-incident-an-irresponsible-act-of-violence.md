Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Quinton Jackson held the UFC light-heavyweight title from May 2007 to July 2008 and the last of his 13 UFC fights was in 2015

The organiser of the event at which former UFC champion Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson's son appeared to violently assault wrestler Stuart Smith has described the incident as "reprehensible".

Knokx Pro Wrestling added that the apparent attack by Raja Jackson "never should have occurred".

Smith's brother said on Sunday that the wrestler - also known as Syko Stu - was "stable but in critical care".

Knokx Pro Wrestling said: "What was supposed to be a planned and agreed upon wrestling spot, turned into a selfish, irresponsible act of violence against Mr Smith."

Smith was appearing on the card at Knokx Pro Wrestling's event in California.

Raja Jackson, a 25-year-old professional MMA fighter, was involved in two incidents with Smith that were shown on live streaming platform Kick.

Jackson was shown being hit on his head outside the venue by US army veteran Smith before the event.

Then, when Smith was fighting an opponent, Jackson climbed into the ring, picked him up and slammed him on to the canvas, which appeared to leave him unconscious.

He then appeared to strike Smith repeatedly before being pulled off by other wrestlers.

Knokx Pro Wrestling added: "This egregious act is reprehensible and never should have occurred.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with our brother Mr Stuart Smith (Syko Stu) as he remains a priority and we are monitoring his well-being.

"In the 17 years of operation of KnokX Pro Wrestling Academy, there has never been anything as heinous take place such as this and we apologize to our patrons and fans."

Quinton Jackson has said he is "deeply concerned" and "very upset that any of this happened".

He also described it as a "work gone wrong" - in wrestling terms, a 'work' is a fight that is staged or scripted.

TMZ has reported that the Los Angeles Police Department is now investigating the incident.

Let's dive into the details: Millie Bright captained England in the 2023 Women's World Cup final

England manager Sarina Wiegman wanted to select Millie Bright for this month's friendly matches before the Chelsea defender announced her international retirement. 

Chelsea captain Bright retired from international football on Monday after winning 88 caps and captaining the team to the 2023 Women's World Cup final.

When asked if she wanted the 32-year-old to be part of England's preparations for the 2027 Women's World Cup, Wiegman replied: "Yes, of course I wanted that. 

"She's still a very good player so I want her in the squad but I totally respect and understand the decision. 

"She had been thinking about it very thoroughly. When a player makes a decision like this and has such an incredible career internationally, then it's not appropriate to have that conversation [try to change her mind]. 

"Off the back of the Euros we had a conversation. She told me she would retire from international football."

Bright was a key player for Wiegman, starting every game at Euro 2022 alongside captain Leah Williamson in central defence and leading the team in the Arsenal player's absence in the World Cup the following year.

The England manager said the demands of the football calendar had influenced Bright's decision to step away from the international game. 

"I loved working with her. What she has done on the pitch and off the pitch as a leader is so incredible," Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"I'm really grateful I had the opportunity to work with her and we really enjoyed it. We had some massive experiences together.

"I will never, ever forget those and really cherish those moments. We will always have something special. We will miss her. 

"Making that decision is very brave when you feel like 'OK, maybe it's time'. She is still having a big impact with Chelsea. It is very intense. So she is not done."

England face Brazil at Etihad Stadium on Saturday, 25 October (17:30 BST) before playing Australia at Pride Park on Tuesday, 28 October (19:00 GMT).

Lucy Bronze fractured her tibia during Euro 2025 but started every game

It is the first squad Wiegman has selected since England won Euro 2025 in July and there are several key players missing because of injury. 

Right-back Lucy Bronze, 33, is included after recovering from the fractured tibia she played with during Euro 2025.

She was a late substitute in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance this season.

Williamson is not in the squad because of a knee injury while Chelsea forward Lauren James also misses out with an ankle issue. 

Williamson and James have yet to play this season as a result of injuries picked up during Euro 2025. 

Forward Lauren Hemp is also missing after suffering an ankle injury in Manchester City's win over Tottenham on 19 September.

There is a first senior call-up for 19-year-old Arsenal centre-back Katie Reid after her impressive performances in the Women's Super League this season.

"She's done really well. Last year she had already played some minutes for Arsenal at centre-back and sometimes a right-back," Wiegman told Radio 5 Live.

"Now she plays continuously as a centre-back and has done really well, I must say. She is a huge talent. 

"This is an opportunity for her to show what she is about in our environment. I'm excited to see her."

Reid's club-mate Taylor Hinds, who joined Arsenal from Liverpool in the summer, is also included.

The 26-year-old had previously switched her allegiances to Jamaica but has not represented them in a competitive fixture and is therefore eligible for the Lionesses.

Hinds' featured in a 3-0 friendly defeat by France in October 2024 for Jamaica having previously played for England's youth teams.

Her inclusion is an indication of Wiegman's plans for an experimental camp as England turn their attentions to the 2027 Women's World Cup.

"She hasn't been involved in the England senior team since I came in but we have followed her for some time," added Wiegman. 

"She is left-footed and can play on her right too. There is a new situation â a new cycle - going into a next World Cup so we want to see what she can bring."

Defender Niamh Charles recovered from an ankle injury in time to start for Chelsea on Sunday and makes the squad.

Midfielder Grace Clinton was left out of Manchester City's squad for Sunday's win at Liverpool with a knock but is also included.

Aston Villa midfielder Lucia Kendall, 21, also receives a first senior call-up after impressive performances for her new club since moving from Southampton.

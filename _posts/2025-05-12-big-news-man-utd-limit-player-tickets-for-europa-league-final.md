Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Manchester United played at San Mames in the first leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Bilbao

Manchester United's players will be restricted to two free tickets each, with on-the-day travel to Bilbao, for next week's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur.

While United's squad have been told they can purchase up to 10 more tickets for the game against Spurs on 21 May at San Mames Stadium, they will also be responsible for organising how friends and relatives get in and out of the northern Spanish city.

United say they are committed to ensuring as many tickets as possible from the club's official 15,000 allocation go to supporters.

At the weekend it was revealed staff will not receive free tickets for the game as previously used to be the case. Instead a viewing party is being hosted in central Manchester.

The decisions come after a series of cost-cutting measures at the club which have included redundancies and the removal of free lunches for staff.

In addition, it has been established if United win, their intention is to celebrate by holding a barbeque at the club's Carrington training ground.

Tottenham are yet to announce their plans in the event of victory but it is expected they will have a parade to show off the trophy.

Newcastle held a parade in the city in March to mark their Carabao Cup triumph, while Liverpool are due to host one on 26 May following their Premier League title success.

United have not held a trophy parade since 2013, which coincided with Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Players were famously irritated in 2008 to discover there was no such celebration to mark their Champions League triumph over Chelsea.

Hosting one this season would have been logistically tricky.

Unlike their last Europa League success, against Ajax in Stockholm in 2017 during Jose Mourinho's time in charge, United will still have a Premier League game to play after the match in Bilbao - when Aston Villa visit Old Trafford on 25 May.

Immediately after that game, United fly to Asia for two post-season matches against local opposition in Malaysia and Hong Kong.

They return to Manchester on 31 May, after which players have to immediately report for international duty.

Portugal have a Nations League semi-final with Germany on 4 June, which would involve Bruno Fernandes and, if fit, Diogo Dalot. 

World Cup qualifiers also take place in South America on 5 June and in Europe from 6 June.

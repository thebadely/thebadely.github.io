Scorecard. Table

Phoebe Litchfield hammered an unbeaten 59 off 28 balls as Northern Superchargers cruised to a clinical eight-wicket win over Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred with 26 balls to spare.

Phoenix looked well positioned to post a challenging total at 44-1 off 30 balls after they had won the toss and decided to bat at Headingley.

However, poor shot selection largely proved their undoing as they lost five wickets for just 15 runs in the next 21 balls.

The exception was Phoenix skipper Ellyse Perry, who was unfortunate to be run out at the non-striker's end after Australian compatriot Annabel Sutherland deflected Marie Kelly's low drive on to the stumps.

An unbroken 57-run stand between Emily Arlott, who top scored with an unbeaten 32, and Sterre Kalis ensured Phoenix managed to scrape themselves to a modest total of 116.

Superchargers lost talented 18-year-old opener Davina Perrin for a run-a-ball 14 off the 19th ball of their reply.

But Litchfield looked in good touch as she hammered a half-century off 25 balls and combined with Sutherland - unbeaten on 20 from 13 balls - to guide the Superchargers home in style.

Victory sent them top of the table on 12 points - level with London Spirit and Southern Brave - while Phoenix remain second bottom on four.

Following scores of four, 22 and five in her first three games, Litchfield had yet to really make much of an impression on this year's tournament.

On a belting Headingley deck, in glorious sunshine, the 22-year-old Australian delivered a destructive batting display as she made her second career fifty in The Hundred.

Litchfield bristled with intent from ball one and produced some intelligent shots alongside some more unorthodox strokeplay.

Midway through her innings, a powerful reverse pull off Emma Lamb for four was followed by a more conventional chip over the top with the same result.

When Litchfield was joined by compatriot Sutherland at the crease, the outcome of the match became a formality.

Phoenix did help themselves with their fielding, though, as fumbles and poor judgement on the boundary cost them runs. 

The game was effectively over by the time Hannah Baker spilled a routine catch in the deep as Phoenix squandered the chance to dismiss Litchfield on 49.

She hit the winning runs in audacious fashion - setting herself for a reverse pull to Millie Taylor, but then clubbing the ball back over the bowler's head for four. 

It is another four-game day on Saturday with double-headers seeing Trent Rockets host Southern Brave (11:00 and 14:30 BST) and Oval Invincibles face Welsh Fire (14:30 and 18:00 BST).

There will be ball-by-ball radio commentary on every game on BBC Sounds. 

Invincibles v Fire are also BBC TV games with the women's game on BBC iPlayer and the men's game on BBC Two and iPlayer.

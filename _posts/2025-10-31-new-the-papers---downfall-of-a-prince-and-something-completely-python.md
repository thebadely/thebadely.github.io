Let's dive into the details: Andrew continues to dominate the morning front pages. The Daily Mail reports that the Prince and Princess of Wales made it clear that the only way forward for the royal family was Andrew's banishment, as the King weighed up his decision. The paper says the King was "gravely concerned" that the future of the monarchy was at stake unless he acted decisively. He made up his mind after being heckled about his brother at Lichfield Cathedral last week, according to the Daily Mirror. Royal experts tell the Express that the Queen was "at the heart" of the decision, owing to concerns that Andrew could detract from her work with sexual abuse charities.

The Times reports that Andrew finally agreed to leave Royal Lodge in Windsor when it was made clear to him that he had lost the support of his former wife, Sarah Ferguson. The paper says she will "make her own plans" and move on with her life when he leaves Windsor. The Guardian believes Andrew is in line for a six-figure payout from the King to cover the cost of his relocation. Sources close to the talks say he will then get an annual stipend equivalent to "several times" his navy pension - which is believed to be Â£20,000 a year.

The Daily Telegraph says Andrew will not move to Sandringham until the New Year - meaning he will not be there when the royal family gathers in Norfolk at Christmas. The Sun has spoken to people who live near the King's Sandringham estate who aren't thrilled by the prospect of their new neighbour. "He's a horrible man. We don't want him up here", one woman says. "We can't bear him either", are the words of another Norfolk man.

Meanwhile the Daily Star, which prominently featured a livestream of a lettuce when Liz Truss was the prime minister, has brought the vegetable back. It features photos of a lorry it has hired being driven around Windsor with a photo and writing on the side saying "lettuce help you move"

Elsewhere, the i Paper reports that the government will allow developers to "flip" newly built affordable social housing, and sell the properties at higher prices to investors and private owners in England. It says councils and housing associations don't have the money to buy the properties. The plan is likely to be announced next week, according to the paper.

The Financial Times reports that new, higher bands of council tax will be introduced for the most expensive homes in the Chancellor's budget later this month. Economists tell the paper the move will raise only a modest sum out of what's needed for what the paper calls a "repair job" on the public finances. The Treasury says it won't comment on speculation.

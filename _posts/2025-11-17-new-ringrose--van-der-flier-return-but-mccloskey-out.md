According to new developments, Garry Ringrose and Josh van der Flier are available again but Stuart McCloskey is injured

Ireland pair Garry Ringrose and Josh van der Flier are both available for Saturday's Test against world champions South Africa, but Stuart McCloskey has been ruled out of the match through injury.

Centre Ringrose and back-row van der Flier have both recovered from hamstring strains in time to be available for selection for the Aviva Stadium meeting with the Springboks after missing the 46-19 win over Australia.

McCloskey misses out with a recurrence of a groin injury which saw him have to retire hurt after 27 minutes of the weekend victory over the Wallabies, Bundee Aki being introduced as his replacement in midfield.

The Ulster centre was initially forced to sit out the 41-10 win over Japan after sustaining the groin problem during the loss to New Zealand on 1 November which began Ireland's autumn campaign.

Meanwhile, Leinster prop Thomas Clarkson has cleared all head injury assessment (HIA) protocols and is set to train fully this week ahead of the Dublin encounter with the world's number-one ranked side.

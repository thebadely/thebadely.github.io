Here’s what you need to know: The Suns had lost their previous eight games against the Thunder

Devin Booker scored with 0.7 seconds remaining as the Phoenix Suns beat defending NBA champions the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-105.

The Thunder led 100-94 with four minutes left, but Booker, who finished with 24 points, nine assists and six rebounds, ended their four-game unbeaten run with his only three-pointer.

Jordan Goodwin recorded career highs of 26 points and eight three-pointers, while Suns team-mate Dillon Brooks scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter at Mortgage Matchup Center in Phoenix.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 25 points, Jalen Williams contributed 23 and Chet Holmgren recorded 18 and nine rebounds for the Thunder, who still have the best record in the Western Conference with 30 wins and six defeats.

The Suns, who are seventh in the West, were thumped 138-89 by the Thunder in the quarter-finals of the NBA Cup in December.

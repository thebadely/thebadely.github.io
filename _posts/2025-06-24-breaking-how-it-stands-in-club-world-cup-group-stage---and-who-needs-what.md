According to new developments, Chelsea need a point from their final game to join Manchester City in the last 16

The Club World Cup is into its final round of group-stage matches with plenty still to be decided.

There is still something to play for in nearly every group.

The top two sides from each group go into the last 16, with head-to-head records used before goal difference to separate teams level on points.

Manchester City are one of eight clubs to have qualified for the last 16 but could face Real Madrid at that stage.

Chelsea need a point to progress, with Bayern Munich potentially waiting in the next round.

BBC Sport examines how each group looks and who needs what to progress.

Botafogo reach last 16 at expense of Atletico Madrid

PSG beat Seattle to reach Club World Cup last 16

Inter Miami and Palmeiras drew 2-2 in their final group game which secured both teams a place in the knockout stages, while Porto and Al Ahly played out a 4-4 thriller.

Palmeiras topped the group on goal difference, with MLS side Inter runners-up.

Palmeiras will play fellow Brazilian side Botafogo on Saturday at 17:00 BST, while Inter face European champions Paris St-Germain on Sunday at 17:00.

Paris St-Germain and Botafogo are through to the last 16.

PSG beat Seattle Sounders 2-0 to top Group B, while Botafogo secured second place despite a 1-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid.

As group winners, PSG will face Group A runners-up Inter Miami, and Botafogo will take on group winners Palmeiras.

Atletico and Seattle have been eliminated.

Auckland City v Boca Juniors, Benfica v Bayern Munich - Tuesday, 24 June (20:00 BST)

Bayern Munich are through and Auckland City are out.

Benfica just only a point to seal their last-16 spot. Boca need Benfica to lose and to win themselves, with a big goal difference swing, to go through.

ES Tunis v Chelsea, Los Angeles v Flamengo - Wednesday, 25 June (02:00 BST)

Flamengo are into the last 16 as group winners and Los Angeles are out.

Chelsea will go through in second place so long as they do not lose to Esperance Sportive de Tunis. But if the Tunisian side win they will qualify instead.

Enzo Maresca's Chelsea side would meet the winners of Group C - Bayern Munich or Benfica - should they qualify for the last 16.

Inter Milan v River Plate, Urawa Reds v Monterrey - Thursday, 26 June (02:00 BST)

The winners of Inter Milan v River Plate will go into the last 16, while a draw would be enough for both so long as Monterrey do not win.

If Monterrey win and the other game ends in a draw, there are multiple possibilities depending on the exact scores in both games.

The top three would all finish on five points, so it would come down to goals scored in the games between the three of them - and, if that is level, goal difference in the group, fair play or even drawing lots.

Urawa Reds are out.

Borussia Dortmund v Ulsan HD, Mamelodi Sundowns v Fluminense - Wednesday, 25 June (20:00 BST)

Fluminense and Borussia Dortmund know a point in their games would take them through.

Mamelodi Sundowns would go through with a win, while Ulsan HD are out.

Juventus v Manchester City, Wydad Casablanca v Al Ain - Thursday, 26 June (20:00 BST)

Juventus and Manchester City are through after winning their first two games.

City need to win the game between the teams to finish top.

The winners of City's group face the runners-up in Real Madrid's group, with the team second in Group G playing the winners of Group H.

Al-Hilal v Pachuca, Red Bull Salzburg v Real Madrid - Friday, 27 June (02:00 BST)

The winners of Salzburg v Real Madrid will progress top of the group, with the losers knocked out should Al-Hilal beat already-out Pachuca.

A draw between Salzburg and Real and a win for Al-Hilal would leave all three sides level on points.

Their head-to-head record would also be the same, leaving Real through thanks to a superior goal difference over the Austrians. Al-Hilal are one goal behind Salzburg on goal difference heading into the final round.

Should Al-Hilal and Salzburg also finish level on goal difference and goals scored, second place could be decided by disciplinary points or, if that is level, drawing lots.

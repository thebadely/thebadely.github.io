It has been recently reported that Nathan Collins received the man-of-the-match award named after his England team-mate Jack Brown, who coached Queensland to four successive Wheelchair State of Origin victories during his time in Australia

Nathan Collins scored 22 points as England came through a testing final warm-up for the Wheelchair Rugby League Ashes to beat Queensland 72-60 on the Sunshine Coast.

Leeds Rhinos pivot Collins scored two tries and landed seven goals as Tom Coyd's side had to come back from an early 12-6 deficit against competitive hosts.

Wheels of Steel winner Joe Coyd scored three of England's 13 tries, and added a goal, as they followed up their 86-10 win over New South Wales in last Friday's tour opener.

Mason Billington and Luis Domingos both scored twice, with one try each for Rob Hawkins, tour captain Lewis King, Seb Bechara and Finlay O'Neill. Wayne Boardman added a goal to the tally.

For Halifax Panthers youngster O'Neill it was a first international try, and he was watched by his father and grandmother, who have travelled from Yorkshire for the tour's early stages.

Queensland included several players who are set to feature for Australia against England later this week, including Zac Schumacher, who scored five of their tries, and Bayley McKenna, who converted all nine of his goal attempts.

Dan Anstey and Adam Tannock scored twice for the hosts and Pete Arbuckle once, with their other goal coming from Jack Kruger.

England face a two-Test series against Australia on the Gold Coast, with the first match on Thursday and the second on Sunday.

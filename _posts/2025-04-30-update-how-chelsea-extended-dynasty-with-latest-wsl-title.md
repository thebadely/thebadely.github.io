Experts revealed that Chelsea won their sixth WSL title in a row with two games to spare

When former manager Emma Hayes announced her departure from Chelsea, a seed of doubt was planted - was this the end of their dominance?

Who could possibly replace the woman who had led them to five successive Women's Super League titles and 14 major trophies in 12 years?

The end of an era, an invitation for their rivals and a new challenge for Chelsea to navigate.

But a year on, those thoughts seemed naive, foolish even, when celebrations broke out at Leigh Sports Village after Chelsea's 1-0 win over Manchester United confirmed them as league champions again. 

Hayes' successor Sonia Bompastor turned around, fist-pumped and roared towards her staff, then unwrapped a flag to give to her players to celebrate with. 

The ease in which she has taken on Hayes' legacy has been just as impressive as Chelsea's unbeaten run and will only strike fear into those hoping to topple them.

There was an air of inevitability as Chelsea rocked up in Manchester on Wednesday night.

To say they were preparing to win their sixth successive WSL title would be wrong. Bompastor admitted they had not entertained the idea that Arsenal would drop points at Aston Villa, in turn opening the door for Chelsea.  

Instead, this was a group of wounded animals, still bruised from their Champions League semi-final humiliation on Sunday and keen to put it right.

When word of Arsenal's 5-2 defeat at Aston Villa eventually spread through the stands at Leigh Sports Village, Chelsea's routine did not falter.

Bompastor stood arms folded, watching on as the players warmed up, acting as if they had no indication what was happening elsewhere. 

This was Chelsea in their usual, ruthless mood, preparing to get the job done.   

It was a stark contrast to the outpouring of emotion that came from the stands 90 minutes later when they were crowned champions again.

Supporters were so sure of victory when Lucy Bronze headed in the game's only goal in the 74th minute, that they sang "Chelsea, champions" on repeat until the end. 

Chelsea, as they have done so often this season, left it late to break the deadlock but did what needed to be done, even when they were not playing their best.

"Mentality monsters" has been their tag in recent times and they leant on that numerous times again this season.

Of their total goals scored, 33% of them came in the final 15 minutes of matches - more than any other WSL team.

They also picked up eight points after coming from behind in games - only Manchester City have earned more from losing positions.

Essentially, it was always Chelsea's title to lose - they had won the previous five WSL trophies, had the biggest budget in the league and invested further in the transfer window.

Their spending has been unmatched - but that is why they are champions. The chasing pack walked, as Chelsea ran, bouyed by their invincible mentality.

When Hayes stepped down, Chelsea recruited one of the best coaches in Europe, snatching Bompastor from French giants Lyon.

When they were pushed to the brink last season by Manchester City, winning their fifth successive title on goal difference, they responded by signing Champions League winners Bronze and Keira Walsh from Barcelona. 

They bounced back from a defeat at Manchester City in the Champions League to beat them days later in the league, and scored a stoppage-time winner against Liverpool to book their place in the Women's FA Cup final. 

They have built a squad capable of challenging on all domestic fronts and they remain on course to win the Treble this season, with two trophies already in the bag.

Is the gap widening between Chelsea and everybody else in the WSL? Their points tally and unbeaten season suggests it is.

Arsenal and Manchester United showed their credentials in spells. But the difference has always been that Chelsea still win when they are vulnerable.

Chelsea's mentality has played a "massive part" in their success, Bompastor said on Wednesday, but her leadership is another key component. 

Brought in under a weight of expectation, with big boots to fill, Bompastor has always remained calm and never looked out of place.

As Liverpool's men celebrated lifting the Premier League trophy just days before - Arne Slot triumphing in the glory of Jurgen Klopp's well-laid foundations - similarities could be seen in Bompastor and Hayes. 

The Frenchwoman arrived in London knowing she had a squad full of talent, depth and experience. Her job was to make them even better. 

'Perfection' and 'the ideal' are words Bompastor has used consistently throughout the season but she knows that will take time.

Always wanting more, she spoke about craving perfection and wanting to develop a true identity next season.

But in just a short space of time, she can have no complaints about their success in England, even if the disappointment of their Champions League exit weighs heavily. 

Bompastor has made tactical tweaks - encouraging more possession, a more aggressive press and a less direct approach on the ball.

She has embedded new signings, turned winger Sandy Baltimore into a full-back and given responsibility to 19-year-old midfielder Wieke Kaptein.

Perhaps the biggest contrast to the Hayes' era is Bompastor's personality.

While Hayes often played mindgames, kept people on their toes and used her platform to challenge norms - Bompastor is sometimes understated.

Her title celebrations appeared to be subdued, but in her own words, she is a "simple person" and will enjoy precious moments with family back in London. 

A "little bit" of champage and some chocolate may be on the cards but Bompastor already has her eye on the Treble.

She was conscious of her achievements but humble enough to acknowledge Hayes' involvement, taking time to thank her in her post-match media conference.

It was a mark of respect as Bompastor began not only reflecting on Chelsea's past achievements, but on what could still come in the future.

This may be the first title win under Bompastor but if this is a far cry from the perfection she craves, Chelsea's future is an exciting one.

Middle Child brings together three distinct pleasures under one carefully considered roof: an all-day eatery, a gourmet grocer, and a cookbook shop. The brainchild of Lebanese chef Lynn Hazim, the concept draws inspiration from the idea of “middle child syndrome,” reimagining it as something quietly confident, thoughtful, and deeply affirming.

Mustard pendant lights and red dining tables inject colour and personality, creating an atmosphere that feels part library, part larder, part neighbourhood eatery.

In the kitchen, Hazim’s philosophy is simple: make the things you want to eat, and do them really well. The menu moves fluidly between Mediterranean and Middle Eastern influences, offering sharing plates, vibrant salads, and comforting mains. Whether you arrive for lunch, dinner, a casual work session, or a browse through cookbooks and gourmet goods, Middle Child invites you to linger between dining destination, cultural space, and everyday retreat.

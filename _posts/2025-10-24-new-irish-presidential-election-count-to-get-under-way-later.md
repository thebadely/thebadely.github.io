Here’s what you need to know: Counting is due to get under way later in the Irish presidential election.

Voters in the Republic of Ireland went to the polls on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, who will replace current head of state Michael D Higgins.

There are two contenders to become the next president, but voters had a choice of three candidates - Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, whose withdrawal from the race came too late to have his name removed from the ballot paper.

Ballot boxes will open at 09.00 local time on Saturday and the result is due to be announced at Dublin Castle later that evening.

Early unofficial indications have suggested the turnout could potentially struggle to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018.

Connolly is an independent politician backed by a number of left-wing parties including Sinn Féin.

She has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 and previously worked as a psychologist and barrister. She is from Galway.

Humphreys is the Fine Gael candidate. She was a TD from 2011 to 2024 and served in a number of senior cabinet ministerial positions, including social protection and justice.

She comes from a Protestant background and is from Monaghan.

The votes, which will be counted in each of the 43 constituencies, will be tallied by political parties as soon as boxes open and these will give early indications of the result.

Some 3.6 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which comes to an end after months of campaigning by both candidates. 

To get nominated, candidates needed either 20 members of the Oireachtas, the Irish houses of parliament, or four city and county councils, to back them.

Connolly was the first to declare her intention to run last July.

She has the support of a number of left-wing parties, including Sinn Féin, Labour and the Social Democrats as well as independent politicians.

Humphreys was selected to run for Fine Gael after the party's initial candidate, former EU Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, withdrew from the race in August for medical reasons.

A third candidate, Jim Gavin, who was selected by the main coalition party, Fianna Fáil, withdrew from the campaign earlier in October after intense controversy over a 16-year-old rental dispute in which he owed €3,300 (£2,870) to a former tenant.

However, as his withdrawal came after the close of nominations, the law states his name must remain on the ballot paper.

Any votes cast for him will be counted as legitimate and transferred to the two other candidates if necessary.

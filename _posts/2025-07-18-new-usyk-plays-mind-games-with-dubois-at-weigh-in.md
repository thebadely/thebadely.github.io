Oleksandr Usyk attempted to get in Daniel Dubois' head one final time by stepping ahead of the Briton and standing at the front of the stage during the weigh-in at BoxPark Wembley.

Dubois tipped the scales at 17st 6lb with Usyk coming in at a career-heavy 16st 3lb for their undisputed heavyweight contest on Saturday.

After a tense face-off the pair turned to the crowd but Usyk walked forward and flexed his muscles to block his rival from view before Dubois followed him.

"I'm locked in, focused and I can't wait," Dubois said.

"I'm going to win by any means necessary."

But Dubois, 27, was cut short when Usyk moved to the front of the stage again - raising his arms to draw a huge cheer.

Dubois, who has 22 wins in 24 fights as a professional, looked perturbed that his rival had stolen the limelight and walked off shaking his head.

It was the final time WBA (Super), WBO and WBC champion Usyk and IBF title-holder Dubois will come face-to-face before meeting in a rematch at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.

Usyk, 38, is undefeated in 23 professional contests and claimed a ninth-round stoppage when they fought in August 2023.

"It's a great opportunity for my people and my country. See you tomorrow," was all Usyk had to say.

Usyk was undisputed at cruiserweight and moved up a division in 2019. He has grown into his heavyweight frame over the past six years and is one pound heavier than when he beat Tyson Fury in December.

He is eight pounds heavier than when he stopped Dubois in Poland 23 months ago.

Londoner Dubois once again had to accept being the B-side on home turf with most of the 400 or so people at BoxPark showing support for Usyk.

Several Ukrainian flags were hanging from the balcony and it was clear who they had come to see, although that support might not cut through as much when around 90,000 pack into Wembley Stadium.

Fellow heavyweights Joseph Parker and Dave Allen were among those watching on, while Britain's last undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis was also in attendance.

Lewis, who held all three world titles in 1999, has urged Dubois to "rise to the occasion" and offered up advice on how to deal with the undefeated Usyk.

"Dubois needs to get that jab going, push him against the ropes and start combinations - don't waste punches and stay eager," Lewis told BBC Sport.

"Remember he is the true heavyweight and needs to press him."

Dubois trimmed down to 16st 9lb when he lost against Usyk but has since found great success after bulking up to beat Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Anthony Joshua.

Dubois is bidding to become the first Briton to reign undisputed in the four-belt era.

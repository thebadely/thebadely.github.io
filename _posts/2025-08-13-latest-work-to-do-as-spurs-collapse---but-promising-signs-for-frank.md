Spurs effectiveness from set pieces 'refreshing to see' - Rooney

It looked like being a dream debut for Tottenham boss Thomas Frank.

Leading 2-0 with little more than five minutes remaining against European champions Paris St-Germain, surely the Super Cup was on its way to north London.

Not so. A stirring comeback from the Parisians and a shootout win stopped Spurs from becoming the first Europa League winners to lift the Super Cup since 2018.

But the Dane's fingerprints were all over this Tottenham performance, which showed promising signs for 85 minutes.

Set-pieces? Check. Pragmatism? Check. Efficiency? Check.

"I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best at this moment in time," said Frank, who replaced Ange Postecoglou as manager this summer.

"We had them exactly where we wanted them for 80 or so minutes. Then the momentum changed with the 2-1 goal. The team and fans have a lot to be proud of.

"The first half was almost perfect and obviously set-pieces were very good and we were very dangerous. 

"At times I think we showed that we can play up against any team in the world."

There's work to be done for Tottenham; their late collapse was evidence of that.

Indeed, it should concern Frank that his team wilted at the first sign of pressure against a side who have had just two pre-season training sessions in the bag.

But for the vast majority of this Uefa Super Cup meeting that ultimately ended in penalty heartache, there were enough signs to suggest Frank has the basis of a system and approach that can be built on.

His 3-5-2 formation was certainly a move away from last season's set up but you get the feeling Frank will be flexible depending on the challenge in the coming months, something his predecessor was often accused of not being.

Inside the opening 10 minutes, the approach was entirely noticeable. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario kicked long five times as Tottenham opted to keep their shape higher up the pitch rather than collect the ball deep inside their own half and pass their way up the field.

Ange Postecoglou's high-risk approach was easy on the eye but the final 18 months of his reign at Tottenham - despite that euphoric Europa League win in Bilbao last May - told us the Australian's methods weren't working.

This was a Tottenham performance less to do with capturing the imagination than capturing the victory.

For example, Postecoglou was maligned for a perceived lack of attention to detail in regard to preparing for set-pieces.

It was significant, then, that both of Tottenham's goals arrived via dead balls.

Expect Frank's Tottenham to excel at set-pieces in their own penalty box, too.

His Brentford side conceded only three Premier League goals from set-pieces (excluding penalties) last season - three fewer than any other team in the division.

Offensively, Brentford were also one of the strongest. Only four teams - Arsenal (14), Crystal Palace, Aston Villa (both 16) and Nottingham Forest (17) - scored from more Premier League set-pieces last season.

Here in Udine, there were clear indicators that Spurs will develop such strength in the coming months.

This was an effective Tottenham display rather than an enchanting one.

Frank said: "I knew we had to do something different against PSG. It was a special operation. And 2-2 against PSG, I think you take that - that single result is good.

"In spells, we went more direct as we knew we could hurt them. There was focus on set-pieces, but there will always be a focus on set-pieces.

"High pressure is a non-negotiable. We went man for man in some aspects."

There was a time when the style of play mattered to Tottenham fans. Ask Jose Mourinho. Ask Antonio Conte.

Both received criticism from supporters for their pragmatic styles. Tottenham's traditions for producing attacking teams still carries weight to this day. It will be interesting to see if supporters get on Frank's back for his tactical approach if things start to falter.

But winning football matches, regardless of style, will be his priority, as it will be for the chairman Daniel Levy.

Tottenham debutants Joao Palhinha and Mohamed Kudus both showed promising signs in Italy.

Kudus, in particular, was excellent - his pace and power created problems for PSG's rearguard throughout.

Yet Tottenham still have work to do in the transfer market before the window closes on 1 September.

Spurs are looking at offensive reinforcements. They are in club-to-club talks over moves for Manchester City winger Savinho and Crystal Palace attacking midfielder Eberechi Eze.

They are also after a centre-back before the deadline, but their first choice target Marc Guehi seems out of reach at the moment.

If Tottenham can sign two high-quality attackers and a defender before the window closes, then that would represent a successful summer in the market.

There are holes in Frank's squad that still need plugging. Tottenham are trying to rectify that.

If they don't, then expect disgruntled supporters, irked by the club's lack of business so far, to make their thoughts heard.

Former Tottenham and England keeper Paul Robinson, talking to BBC Radio 5 Live: In the next 24-48 hours, Thomas Frank has to go back to the training ground, unpack it, show the players video of everything they did well and put the belief back into them.

I think this will be damaging for Tottenham, I really do. You can see the players standing on the pitch separately in little huddles and on their own. They are absolutely devastated.

They got the trophy that they had been longing for last season and this could have been a real step forward for Tottenham. Instead it's a real blow.

Former Spurs winger Aaron Lennon on BBC Radio 5 Live: You can see that the Tottenham players are hurting. As a player you know games you should win and this was one of them.

Five minutes to go, 2-0 up, see it out. Even when it goes to 2-1, you've got to know how to see a game out.

Tottenham didn't handle that well enough.

I still think Tottenham need a few players in. There are links with Eberechi Eze and Savinho. Losing James Maddison [to injury] and Son Heung-min is huge for this football club - two big players and big characters and leaders, and lots of goals and assists.

Former Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy talking to BBC Sport: Tottenham went man for man and gained control with their discipline. It has to be done perfectly and you can see they have worked on it.

The good thing for Tottenham was even when they dropped deep they were OK. There were a lot of good things for Tottenham fans from that first half.

Set-plays were a big part of Frank's Brentford last season and I think that will be a good thing for Tottenham this season.

I think to get back into the European places and have a good run in the Champions League, that would be realistic. I think there is lots to look forward to: better competition for places, younger players with more experience and there are still a few weeks left in the window.

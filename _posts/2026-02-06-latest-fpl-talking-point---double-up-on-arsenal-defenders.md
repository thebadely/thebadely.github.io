Experts revealed that Will Arsenal trio William Saliba (left), Jurrien Timber (centre) and Gabriel find their way into your team?

The Arsenal triple up feels obvious and owning at least two of their defensive assets is essential right now. 

The Gunners host Sunderland and then have a double gameweek of Brentford and Wolves next week.

Very few, if any, of their attackers will get 270 minutes over the three games and those that own the injured Bukayo Saka should make the switch to 90-minute man Declan Rice without hesitation. 

Triple Arsenal defence is also an option with Gabriel, Jurrien Timber and goalkeeper David Raya a high risk, high reward play.

Elsewhere, midfielder Enzo Fernandez has four goals, one assist in his past six league games and has become Chelsea's most reliable asset. 

His busy schedule shouldn't put you off buying him in a week when boss Liam Rosenior has praised his athleticism, leadership and recovery time. A visit to Wolves followed by home games against Leeds and Burnley puts Chelsea top of the fixture ticker over the next three.

Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes has the most assists in the Premier League this season with 12, while Manchester City's Erling Haaland has the most goals with 20

Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes has averaged eight points a game since Ruben Amorim left Old Trafford and now playing back in his natural number 10 position, he's become a must have FPL asset once again. 

Attacking returns feel as likely as ever and with penalties, free kicks, corners, a 90-minute guarantee and a good chance of defensive contribution, he has more routes to points than virtually any other player in the game.

Manchester City's Erling Haaland has one league goal in seven and it's time for those that haven't already done so already to start considering alternative choices.

Patrick Mahomes on Travis Kelce's tying franchise touchdown record

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said that Travis Kelce is the "true Chiefs chief" after tying the team's touchdown record in Monday's win over the Washington Commanders.

For the first time in his career, Mahomes was intercepted on each of his team's first two possessions, but he found his rhythm after the interval to inspire the Chiefs to a 28-7 win.

The score was 7-7 at half-time before the NFL's two-time Most Valuable Player made three touchdown passes in the second half to Kareem Hunt, Rashee Rice and Kelce.

Mahomes completed 25 of his 34 passes for 299 yards while tight end Kelce enjoyed his best performance of the season, making six catches for 99 yards.

The 36-year-old's third touchdown of the season was his 83rd overall, putting him level with Priest Holmes for the most regular-season touchdowns in franchise history.

"He is the guy that's been here through the whole thing, been here with coach [Andy] Reid the entire time, and he helped set the culture.

"I was able to come in and have that guy to rely on. He's breaking all the records now but he's all about the team."

Kelce considered retirement after the Chiefs' Super Bowl defeat by the Philadelphia Eagles in February but committed to at least another season in March.

The three-time Super Bowl winner said he and Commanders tight end Zach Ertz, 34,  are making the most of the time they have left in their career.

"We're cherishing every single one of these games, not knowing how long we'll be able to do this," said Kelce. 

The Chiefs' third consecutive win made it four from their past five games, improving their record to 5-3, while the Commanders slipped to 3-5.

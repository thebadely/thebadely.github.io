Experts revealed that A pilot scheme designed to identify and nip potential health problems in the bud has been launched by the Isle of Man's public health directorate.

The so-called fit checks have begun at Ramsey Group Practice in the north of the island, as part of a project that could also help to shape future services.

They look at the lifestyle, mental well-being, and basic physical health of people aged between 18 and 39.

Public health consultant Dr Ross Keat said supporting people earlier to make small preventative changes would make "a big difference later on".

Some 3,500 people in the north of the island within that age bracket are eligible for the checks.

The checks will be carried out by two pre-existing nurses that support GP staff and would not replace GP appointments, Keat explained, adding that the cost would be minimal and absorbed by Ramsey Group Practice.

He said it was hoped the scheme could be expanded into island-wide services, with the pilot offering health and care services "a blueprint"  to roll it out in other areas.

Frailty coordinator Georgia Zapparoli, who normally worked with people in their later years, said the 18 to 39 age bracket was key as "common themes" ran through the lifestyle of many older patients.

Zapparoli said getting people into "good habits" before they reach 50 would mean "in 30 years time we won't have the same need in the general population as we do now".

Also from 18 to 39, she said people tended to neglect themselves by "working more hours than we do for the rest our lives".

"Because we can, because we're young, we push ourselves too hard, we burn the candle at both ends, she said, which created problems that arose when people where in their 50s.

Zapparoli said questions in the appointments would also look at people's living situations, employment status, social life, and physical activity - to help shape future services.

"If we find out for example, that 60% of our young people are working in really hard physical labour, we will need to make sure that in 20 years time we've invested in physiotherapy," she said.

While the questions "might seem a little bit probing", no one was being "judged" and it was important to get honest answers to invest in the right services for the island, she added.

According to new developments, Two artists have worked with children and users of a wellbeing and cancer support centre to create new murals in a Staffordshire town. 

Local artists Kate O and Wingy worked with pupils from Two Rivers School, which provides special education, and Tamworth Wellbeing and Cancer Support Centre. 

New Urban Era (Nue), which organised the projects as part of its outreach programme, said the initiatives had fostered "creativity, connection, and a sense of accomplishment among participants". 

The murals were painted on walls at the two sites where they are now being displayed. 

Art group Nue said it consulted with Two Rivers School's deputy head, as well as the manager of the cancer support centre, at the start of the projects. 

"These crucial discussions ensured that the projects were tailored to the unique needs and abilities of the users, artists and locations, maximizing their impact," Nue said. 

The artists guided participants through the mural creation process, which began with "get to know you sessions" exploring individual abilities and the principles of mural work. 

Two Rivers School saw a core group of 12 pupils complete the project, "resulting in several inspiring murals now adorning their space", Nue said. 

And a group of 15 users who attend the wellbeing centre off Crowden Road made a a "beautiful and meaningful" final mural, it added. 

"We are incredibly proud of the profound impact this programme has had on the participants and the communities of Tamworth," said Nue founder Vic Brown.

"By bringing art and collaboration directly to these vital venues, we've not only created stunning visual pieces but also fostered an environment of healing, self-expression and connection. 

"The dedication of the artists and the enthusiastic participation of the users have made this initiative a truly remarkable success."

Both artists, Kate O and Wingy, successfully completed an NVQ Level 2 counselling course as part of the programme, to support their professional development in working within the health sector.

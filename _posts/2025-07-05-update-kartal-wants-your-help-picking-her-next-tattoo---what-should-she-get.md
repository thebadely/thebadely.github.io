Let's dive into the details: Kartal battled back from 4-1 down in the first set against Parry

British number three Sonay Kartal has said she wants help picking a new tattoo after reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon.

The 23-year-old booked her place in the last 16 with a 6-4 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry on Friday.

Kartal will face Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the next round on Sunday, but has made no secret of her desire to add to the 14 tattoos she already has.

"I'm not one to say no to a tattoo," she said after her win over Parry. "I think I can easily be persuaded.

"I'm just lacking on a few creative ideas myself so if people have any ideas let me know and I'm sure that I will definitely get one."

Kartal was ranked 298th in the world before Wimbledon last year but is now 51st and is the only Briton left in the women's singles draw.

Her run at this year's tournament is her best ever performance at a Grand Slam, beating her appearance in the third round in 2024.

Of her 14 tattoos, Kartal includes the year '2022' to mark the first time she played in all four Grand Slams.

What do you think she should get next? Comment below and suggestions need to be more creative than a strawberry!

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Great Britain have appeared on the podium 15 times in the team event since 1975

Great Britain won a silver medal in the team competition at the 2025 Jumping European Championships in Spain. 

It is the first time GB has featured on the podium at the event, which happens every two years, since they finished third in 2019. 

The team - Ben Maher on Dallas Vegas Batilly, Matthew Sampson on Medoc de Toxandria, Donald Whitaker on Millfield Colette and Scott Brash on Hello Folie - were in first place after Thursday's first round, with Germany and Belgium occupying the other podium positions. 

However, both GB and Germany picked up four time faults in round two while Belgium only collected one. 

Gold medallists Belgium finished with a final score of 5.61, with Britain in second place with a score of 7.96 and Germany in third with 8.19. Ireland (12.39) finished in fourth place. 

It is the second time Belgium have been crowned European champions, having previously won the event in Rotterdam in 2019. 

Great Britain have appeared on the podium 15 times since the team event was introduced in 1975, winning five golds, six silvers, and four bronze medals.

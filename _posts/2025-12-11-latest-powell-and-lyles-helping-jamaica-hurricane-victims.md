It has been recently reported that Powell and Lyles have respective 100m personal bests of 9.72 and 9.79 seconds

Two-time 100m world record holder Asafa Powell has teamed up with Olympic gold medal-winning sprinter Noah Lyles to help those affected by Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica. 

The category-five hurricane hit the Caribbean island in October, killing at least 28 people. 

Powell, a member of Jamaica's 4x100m gold medal-winning team at the 2016 Olympics, lives in capital city Kingston and has visited areas most heavily hit to help those affected. 

"My heart was just overwhelmed with sadness," Powell told BBC World Service.

"I tried not to focus too much on the devastation and tried to see how I could best assist.

"When you see mothers with young babies, or people who can't even shower and have had mud on them for days - it is something that will make you cry."

Lyles won the 100m gold medal at the 2024 Paris Games and is also a four-time 200m world champion. 

Now-retired Powell is pleased that the rivalry on the track between Jamaica and Lyles' US has brought the countries together in a time of need.

"We are trying to give back everywhere we can." Powell said on the help he and Lyles are providing.

"Last week, I gave two houses [to families in need]. They were very happy and that made me feel overwhelmed with joy. My wife actually cried and the families cried when they received the house. 

"One family had four kids and one had three kids so I can imagine how happy they are to have a home.

"Whenever I am on the track competing, these are the people who have been cheering me on and feeling proud of me. To give something back makes me feel very proud and makes me want to do a lot more."

Powell has called for the "big organisations" to carry on with their help of Jamaica and not move on when the attention from the disaster has gone.

"I am going to keep helping every month, they should stay in it for the long run and make sure everyone is back in their home," he added.

"There is a lot more going on in the world and every minute I see a different flood or natural disaster. There is a lot to do and a lot of people to help but I hope the best for my country."

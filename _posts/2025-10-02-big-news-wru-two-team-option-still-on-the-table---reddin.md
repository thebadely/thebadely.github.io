It has been recently reported that Dave Reddin has previously worked for the Football Association, Team GB and the RFU

The possibility of cutting two professional sides is "still on the table", says Welsh Rugby Union director of rugby Dave Reddin after the governing body finished its consultation process.

The WRU produced a document in August in which Reddin and his senior colleagues presented four options on the future of the number of men's professional sides, with the two-team model described by the governing body as part of the "proposed optimal system".

A public survey into the radical plans saw more than 7,000 complete the document, while the WRU held a month-long consultation with players, stakeholders, politicians and the professional sides.

There was overwhelming public opposition to cutting from the current four - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets - to two teams from across the Welsh game, but Reddin says the proposal has not yet been shelved.

"Everything's still on the table and we haven't made a decision yet," he said.

"We can't keep everybody happy, we've got to make the right decision for the future of Welsh rugby over the longer term, not just the short term.

"We have to balance this system in a different way to the way it exists at the moment. 

"So there will be change, there's no doubt about that. We want to provide a compelling argument for people to understand that change and get behind it."

Anxiety and uncertainty lingers as season looms

WRU plans will drive talent to leave - Wales players

The players have been among the most vocal in response to the two-team suggestion.

The Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) has told the WRU its proposals for the elite men's game would "drive talent to leave Wales" and made it clear it did not agree with its "optimal solution".

"We've heard those voices loud and clear, the players' voices, we've met with players several times now," said Reddin.

"Their voice is central to this as, as is the fans. 

"It would be easy to say the players don't like it so it can't be this, this and this.

"Respectfully, the players are a massively important voice but they are not a uniformed voice.

"There are different people in that group who have vastly different ambitions and needs from a system. That's not a homogenous opinion."

Wales captain Jac Morgan told the WRU unless he would leave Welsh professional club rugby if he was not playing for Ospreys.

"I have spoken to Jac, he is clearly one of our most precious talents," said Reddin.

"He is somebody we will be desperate to keep in Wales. Jac is an ambitious player and I respect absolutely where he is coming from in respect of the Ospreys.

"What we want to create is a system that turns Welsh players' heads and says 'I would love to stay here, almost regardless of what the name on the door says, because it is the best system for me and one I can thrive, win and feel connected to my national identity and where I can help my national team develop'. 

"I hope through continued conversations with people like Jac we can build something that is super attractive to him and others so they want to stay."

WRU 'committed' to URC despite team cut plan

Reddin says a final decision by the WRU board is promised by the end of October.

"We want to provide as much clarity as possible and then it's the board's decision to make," said Reddin.

While the option will be announced by 31 October, Reddin says the exact details might not be agreed, especially if professional sides are cut with the process set to drag on.

"We'll have an influence on what we can announce," Reddin told the Scrum V podcast.

"There's a lot of complexity inside of that if there is to be a reduction in the number of teams, how that might play out in terms of what could be a merger or something different to that."

Reddin says he hopes consensus between professional sides would aid the process of cutting teams with a possible tender process used as almost a final resort. 

Wales begin their home autumn campaign on Sunday, 9 November against Argentina before further games against Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.

Despite some of the issues not being resolved, Reddin says he hopes the off-the-field uncertainty should not overshadow Steve Tandy's first campaign charge as Wales' new head coach.

"Whatever the decision is, there's going to be a transitional period into what things are going be that will outlast the autumn," said Reddin.

"The decision is about giving the game clarity as quickly as possible.

"I'm working closely with Steve and his team and he's aware of everything and positively involved in that process as well.

"The autumn needs to take care of itself and needs to be a real focus for Steve and his team independently."

It has been recently reported that Parker was the WBO heavyweight champion from December 2016 to March 2018

Former world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker has denied taking "any prohibited substance" after testing positive for cocaine.

The 33-year-old New Zealander was tested by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) on 25 October.

On the same day, he was beaten by Britain's Fabio Wardley at London's O2 Arena.

Sources have confirmed to BBC Sport that Parker tested positive for the recreational drug, and not performance-enhancing drugs, while his promoted confirmed there had been an "adverse finding" on Friday.

"Before my recent fight, I took a voluntary test and have now been informed that it returned an adverse result," Parker wrote on his Instagram account.

"This came as a real surprise to me.

"I did not take any prohibited substance, I do not use performance-enhancing drugs and do not support their use.

"I am co-operating fully with the process now under way, and I am confident the investigation will clear my name."

Parker, who has 36 wins from his 40 professional fights, could receive a two-year ban but could also be suspended for as little as three months depending on circumstances.

Any ban would be handed down by UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC).

Ukad, however, did not administer this test and will need to conduct its own investigation.

The BBC has contacted Vada and the BBBC for comment.

"When the investigation is complete, I will speak openly and answer questions," added Parker.

Parker was hoping to put himself in position for a fight against undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk, before he lost to Wardley.

Parker was WBO heavyweight champion between 2016 and 2018, with his reign ended by Britain's Anthony Joshua in Cardiff.

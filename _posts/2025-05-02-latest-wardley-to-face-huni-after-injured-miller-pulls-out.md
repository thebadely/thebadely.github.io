It has been recently reported that Fabio Wardley (left) will face Justis Huni (right), who won his past three fights by technical knockout

British heavyweight Fabio Wardley will face Justis Huni on 7 June after Jarrell Miller pulled out of their fight because of injury.

Wardley was set to meet American Miller at Portman Road - the home of his beloved Ipswich Town.

However, Queensberry Promotions said on Wednesday that Miller "sustained a shoulder injury during training camp".

Australian Huni, 26, has a perfect record after 12 professional contests with seven of those victories coming inside the distance.

"All action shootout - just how we like it!" Wardley posted on X.

Huni is number one in the WBO rankings and has fought just twice outside his homeland, with one of those bouts on the Anthony Joshua v Francis Ngannou undercard in Saudi Arabia last year.

Undefeated Englishman Wardley, 30, vacated his British belt in March as he pursues a world title.

Miller taunted Wardley by wearing a Norwich shirt with 'going down 25' on the back - referencing rivals Ipswich's relegation from the Premier League - when they met at a chaotic news conference last month. 

The pair had to be held apart by security guards after Miller, who served a two-year doping ban after twice testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug in 2019 and 2020, accused Wardley of making a 'diss song' about him.

Queensberry also announced that Olympic bronze medallist Lewis Richardson will make his professional debut.

Richardson, 27, was the only Briton to bring home a boxing medal from the Paris Olympics last summer.

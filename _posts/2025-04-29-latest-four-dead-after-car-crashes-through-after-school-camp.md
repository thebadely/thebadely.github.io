Let's dive into the details: Four people, including children, were killed and several others injured when a vehicle drove through a building used by an after-school camp in Illinois.

The victims at the YNOT After School Camp are believed to range in age from four to 18, police said. 

The vehicle struck multiple people outside a building in Chatham on Monday afternoon, then continued through the building, hitting several people inside before exiting out the opposite side. It is unclear if it was deliberate.

Six people were injured and taken to hospital by ambulance and helicopter. Illinois State Police said the driver was unhurt and was taken to hospital for evaluation.

Police have not released the age of the driver and investigation for a motive is ongoing.

State police said they responded to the scene at about 15:30 local time (21:30 BST) on Monday. Three of the dead were struck by the vehicle outside the building, while one victim was hit inside the building.

Police across Illinois attended the scene to secure the area and help victims and parents locate their children, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.

Footage posted online appeared to show large holes in the building. Traffic near the scene was also shut down.

In a post on X, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said his administration was monitoring the crash. 

"Let's wrap our arms around the community tonight as we receive updates on the situation," he wrote.

Illinois state senator Doris Turner said she was "heartbroken" by the incident and that her office was ready to assist local authorities.

Chatham police department also asked for people to pray for the community in a Facebook post.

YNOT After School Camp runs outdoor programs for children, including field trips and activities such as hiking and fishing, according to their website. 

Chatham is a village of 14,000 people about three miles (4.8km) outside of the state capital Springfield.

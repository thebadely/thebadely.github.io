Scorecard

Scotland slumped to a disappointing 97-run defeat by the United Arab Emirates, damaging their faltering defence of the World Cup League 2 crown. 

The Scots made heavy weather of a three-wicket win over the same opponents on Sunday and on this occasion were comprehensively beaten by the lowest-ranked team in the tournament.

UAE captain Rahul Chopra made his first one day international century (101) to help steer his side to 296-6.

Opener Aryansh Sharma contributed 56 and Muhammad Waseem (41) added some late fireworks with his skipper, who made the most of his escape from a big lbw claim on 30.

Scotland's response was lacklustre, losing a succession of batters to poor shots.

George Munsey was out for 43 in the 19th opener shortly after the departure of fellow opener Charlie Tear (27).

Richie Berrington and Finlay McCreath threatened to drag Scotland back into the contest but fell in quick succession for 32 and 33 respectively.

That left them on 164-5 at the end of the 35th over and from there the challenge quickly fizzled out as Simranjeet Singh finished with four wickets and Aayan Khan claimed three.

"Credit to UAE," Berrington told ICC.TV. "It wasn't our best day. At this level, you need to be a lot more consistent." 

It is just a third win from 14 competition outings for UAE, while Scotland sit mid-table with seven victories from their 13 matches.

With the Netherlands hosting this tri-nation sequence, Scotland meet the hosts next on Saturday.

According to new developments, What does Grimsby Town's dramatic win over Manchester United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday mean for this town in North East Lincolnshire famous for its once mighty fishing industry? 

Shaun Webster, like many in Grimsby today, has a spring in his step and a reason to smile.

For 23 years, he has been a Grimsby Town steward. 

"Being a safety steward, I'm supposed to be impartial - but how could I be last night?" he says, with a glint in his eye.

The Mariners' shirt he is wearing on his stroll through the town centre might also  give away his allegiances.

He was among thousands packed into Blundell Park to watch the game, with the League Two side winning 12-11 on penalties following a 2-2 draw in normal time. 

Google Trends said more than one million had searched for Grimsby v Manchester United by mid-morning on Wednesday. It has also trended number one UK-wide on X overnight.

Mr Webster, 62, says: "The atmosphere in that ground last night was fantastic. Both sets of fans were brilliant.

"The whole town is on a high. I feel very proud. We all do.

"Any club coming to Grimsby now will see the place as a fortress."

Mr Webster is not the exception; everywhere in this close-knit town are people with links to the "Mighty Mariners".

Sitting at a table in St James' Square, where the town's Fishermen's Memorial statue takes pride of place, I spot Gary Childs, a former midfielder who spent nine seasons at the club.

United boss Ruben Amorim conceded his team were "completely lost", but Town fans said they were worthy winners, with some likening the victory to the club's 3-0 thrashing of West Ham in the FA Cup in 1996.

"I actually scored in that game," says Childs, who decided to settle in Grimsby after hanging up his boots.

"The atmosphere in that ground last night was very similar. Fantastic."

Like the steward, he is grinning like a Cheshire cat today.

"Grimsby Town has been in the  doldrums for quite a few years but there's a real feel-good factor about the place now," says the 61-year-old.

 "Just walking around the place, you feel it. Everyone is happy. Everyone wants to be part of it."

Including him?

"I'd have loved to have been on that pitch," he says. "Just maybe not at the end, taking those penalties.

"I said to the person next to me, 'those lads' legs will be like jelly walking up to that penalty spot."

While thousands packed the stands at Blundell Park, others watched the hair-raising action unfold from the comfort of their living rooms.

After the match, Sarah Harrison, owner of The Hair Saloon, posted on social media that every Grimsby Town player was welcome to a free haircut.

Between snips, stylist Mel Sharpe reflects on the game.

"We watched it on telly," she says. "This win is brilliant for the town, which does tend to get quite a bit of negative press." 

Her customer, Marleen Braithwaite, 77, adds: "My husband and I watched it on telly, while our son took his two boys to the game. 

"They all stayed at our house last night. It was a late night. We were all so happy.

"Grimsby is a proud town. It used to be all about fish..."

"Now it's a town that has beaten Manchester United," interjects Ms Sharpe, as both women chuckle.

Councillor Hayden Dawkins, North East Lincolnshire Council's portfolio holder for culture, heritage and the visitor economy and a Mariners fan of 30 years, agrees.

"People will look at Grimsby and say, 'you beat Manchester United'. And [it's] not a small team, I might add.

"The belief on show last night was phenomenal. This is a club and a town on the up. I hope more people will come to Grimsby to see the place."

Some watched from afar, with the world's eyes seemingly on this small North East Lincolnshire town.

Michael, 33, is on holiday in Turkey with his wife Demi, 29, their two children, and other relatives.

Such is his love for the club he named his eldest son Mariner-James. 

More than a dozen of them, most wearing Grimsby Town shirts, took over a pub to watch the side in action.

"The atmosphere was amazing," says Michael. 

"There were a few Liverpool fans in the bar too and of course they were cheering on Grimsby too."

Laughing, he adds: "I hung around the hotel lobby afterwards to exchange a bit of banter." 

Back in the cooler climes of Grimsby, Jenny Watkinson, wearing red, stands out among the black and white shirts.

A Manchester United fan, I wonder.

"I am," she says. "But not when they're playing Grimsby Town. I was a season pass holder for five years but I've nobody to go with now - I shout too much.

"Last night I was definitely shouting and supporting the Mariners. They were brilliant."

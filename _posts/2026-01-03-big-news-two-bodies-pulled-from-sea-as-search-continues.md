Here’s what you need to know: Two people have been recovered from the sea off the east Yorkshire coast, including a 67-year-old man who later died at the scene, police say.

Humberside Police did not provide the gender or age of the second body they recovered in Withernsea, but said the circumstances are not suspicious and searches continue for one more person who entered the water.

HM Coastguard had earlier said it was searching for two people after initially responding to reports of a "number of people in difficulty in the water".

The incident was reported at 15:10 GMT, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.

The 67-year-old unconscious man was pulled from the water at the central promenade in Withernsea, and despite the efforts of paramedics died at the scene.

A police spokesperson said the circumstances around the man's death were not thought to be suspicious.

"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues," they said.

"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely."

The search was paused at about 00:30 on Saturday morning, with it set to continue at first light. 

Hornsea Inshore Rescue earlier said it had faced "horrendous conditions" and there had been 9.8ft (3m) waves.

A large cordon that was in place has been lifted and the operation involved about 100 members of the emergency services, including Yorkshire Ambulance and Humberside Fire and Rescue.

BBC reporter Danny Savage at the scene said it was a high tide and the light had faded fast.

He said: "It's freezing with the windchill factor and it would not get light until much later in the morning at this time of year."

Let's dive into the details: MasterChef presenter John Torode has said he is subject to an allegation of using racist language, upheld as part of an inquiry into separate allegations against co-host Gregg Wallace.

In an Instagram post on Monday, Torode said the allegation was that he made the remarks in 2018 or 2019 and that he had apologised immediately afterwards.

However, the TV chef said he had "no recollection" of any of it, adding: "I do not believe that it happened."

It comes after an inquiry ordered by MasterChef's production company Banijay found that 45 allegations about Wallace's behaviour on the programme were upheld, for which he apologised.

Two standalone allegations made against other people were also upheld, including one for using racist language. 

In his statement, Torode said: "For the sake of transparency, I confirm that I am the individual who is alleged to have used racial language on one occasion. 

He added that the allegation included that the "person I was speaking with did not believe that it was intended in a malicious way and that I apologised immediately afterwards".

"I have absolutely no recollection of any of this, and I do not believe that it happened," he said. 

"However, I want to be clear that I've always had the view that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment. I'm shocked and saddened by the allegation as I would never wish to cause anyone any offence."

It came as the Sun reported that the BBC and production company Banijay had asked Torode to leave MasterChef and claim he had mental health issues following the allegation, but he refused.

On Monday night, BBC insiders distanced themselves from that claim.

Reacting to separate allegations which were upheld against him earlier on Monday, Wallace said he was "deeply sorry for any distress" he had caused.

In a statement to PA news agency, he added that he "never set out to harm or humiliate".

In total, the report highlighted 83 allegations made against the TV presenter, with the majority of the substantiated claims relating to inappropriate sexual language and humour, but also culturally insensitive or racist comments.

Wallace's statement came after he was sacked from the programme last Tuesday.

On the same day, he wrote a lengthy statement in which he claimed to have been cleared of "the most serious and sensational allegations" made against him.

He also accused BBC News of "uncorroborated tittle tattle" in its reporting.

He stepped away from presenting MasterChef in November 2024 while the allegations were being investigated.

The investigation kickstarted a nationwide discussion about workplace behaviour, with Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy warning there were "too many cultures of silence".

On Monday, Nandy said the allegations against Wallace were "horrendous and appalling".

"This case highlights a wider issue and much more must be done to ensure that everyone working in the creative industries is treated with dignity, fairness, and respect," she added.

Human rights barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy, who chairs a new watchdog aimed at improving standards of behaviour in the creative industries, warned that there had been "multiple missed opportunities" to act on bad behaviour.

A recent report into the BBC found that a small number of its stars and managers "behave unacceptably" at work, and that bosses often fail to tackle them.

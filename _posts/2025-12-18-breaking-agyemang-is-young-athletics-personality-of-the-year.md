Agyemang named Young Sports Personality of the Year

England forward Michelle Agyemang has been named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year 2025.

The 19-year-old enjoyed a breakthrough year as she helped the Lionesses win Euro 2025 in Switzerland - just three months after making her senior international debut.

She proved decisive off the bench at the Euros, scoring crucial late equalisers in the quarter-final win against Sweden and in the semi-final victory over Italy.

Her interventions led to her being named young player of the tournament, and she was later awarded the Golden Girl trophy for the best young player in Europe.

"Wow. Thank you so much. I am so grateful. To all my team-mates, coaches, I am so grateful," Agyemang said after receiving the award on Thursday.

"To my family, who have supported me all this year and throughout my career - even if it hasn't been that long - I love you. 

"A big thank you to God for this opportunity. I am so thankful."

Agyemang was also nominated for the Kopa Trophy for the world's best under-21 female player.

She has been on loan at Brighton from Arsenal since September 2024, with the Seagulls re-signing her on loan in August after her success with England.

Last season, she scored five goals in 22 appearances as Brighton came fifth in the Women's Super League - their highest finish in the competition.

However, Agyemang is set to miss the rest of the 2025-26 season after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament while playing for the Lionesses in October.

Agyemang made her senior England debut in a Nations League game against Belgium in April, when she scored a stunning volley just 41 seconds after coming on as a substitute

Agyemang came off the bench to score an 81st-minute equaliser against Sweden to take England's Euro 2025 quarter-final to extra-time and then penalties, where the Lionesses triumphed 3-2

On as a late substitute again, Agyemang scored in the 96th minute to drag England level in their semi-final against Italy, before Chloe Kelly sealed a 2-1 success in extra time

Agyemang was presented with her award by England and Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze and Gladiators star Harry Aikines-Aryeetey.

In 2024, darts player Luke Littler won the Young Sports Personality of the Year award.

Littler, 18, was also nominated in 2025, along with 19-year-old England cricketer Davina Perrin.

The judging panel for Young Sports Personality of the Year included 2014 Rugby World Cup winner Maggie Alphonsi, former England and professional footballer Anita Asante, double Paralympic gold medal-winning sprinter Libby Clegg, former world champion boxer Carl Frampton and 2009 World Cup-winning cricketer Ebony Rainford-Brent.

Media personality and sports presenter Josh Denzel, sports broadcaster and Match of the Day co-host Kelly Cates, Daily Mail chief sports feature writer Riath Al-Samarrai and Times sports reporter Molly Hudson were also on the panel.

Representing the BBC were director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski, head of content Philip Bernie and executive producer Marc Vesty.

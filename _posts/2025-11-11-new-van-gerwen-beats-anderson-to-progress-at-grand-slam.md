Here’s what you need to know: Van Gerwen is a three-time Grand Slam winner

Three-time world champion Michael van Gerwen beat Gary Anderson to progress to the knockout stages of the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton.

In the final round of group matches, both players knew only a win would see them through to the second round, which begins on Wednesday.

Dutchman Van Gerwen averaged 108.5 to win 5-2 in a superb display, while defeat for Anderson meant he finished bottom of Group G, suffering an early exit from the tournament.

Beau Greaves earned her first win of the competition, coming from three legs down to beat Niko Springer 5-3, but missed out on the knockout stages as the German progressed.

The 21-year-old, who beat Luke Littler in October to become the first woman to reach the World Youth Championship final, was already eliminated, having lost to Anderson on Sunday.

Meanwhile, defending champion Littler's place in the second round was already sealed, but the 18-year-old continued his 100% record with a 5-1 victory over Daryl Gurney.

The teenager's solid performance secured top spot in Group E and the world champion will face Wessel Nijman in the next round on Thursday.

Dutch player Nijman needed a convincing win against already-eliminated Lisa Ashton to progress from Group F and did not drop a leg in a one-sided performance.

Northern Ireland's Josh Rock joined him after knocking out Gian van Veen, while Englishman Connor Scutt also progressed after beating Czech player Karel Sedlacek 5-3.

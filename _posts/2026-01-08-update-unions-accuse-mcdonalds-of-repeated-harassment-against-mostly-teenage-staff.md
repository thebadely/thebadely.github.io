Let's dive into the details: A group of trade unions has alleged McDonald's has violated international labour standards by failing to tackle sexual harassment in its UK restaurants and franchises.

It comes after a BBC investigation exposed a toxic culture at the fast-food chain in which workers, some as young as 17, were being groped and harassed. Last year, McDonald's staff told us they still faced sexual abuse and harassment.

The unions complained to an independent unit within government which has now offered to intervene by mediating between the unions and McDonald's.

The fast-food chain said it was "reviewing the information and considering next steps".

The complaint from trade unions was referred to the UK National Contact Point (NCP) - an independent unit which sits with the Department for Business and Trade, run by a mix of civil servants and external advisors.

After conducting an initial assessment, the UK NCP has decided the complaint merits further consideration and will now offer mediation to both parties.

The group of five trade unions, including the Bakers Union and the TUC, alongside the Corporate Justice Coalition, state that their complaint - which was lodged in February 2024 - was prompted by the BBC's investigation.

The complaint said there had been "further evidence of persistent, deeply rooted gender-based discrimination" in McDonald's restaurants, in breach of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.

It described "repeated episodes" of harassment against McDonald's workers, "most of them teenagers". It also accuses managers of failing to stop such behaviour.

The Department for Business and Trade said its decision to accept the complaint is not a finding against McDonald's. It also said it does not mean that it considers that the company has acted inconsistently with OECD guidelines.

It said the mediation offer is voluntary and if any party declines to take part, the UK NCP will conduct a further examination of the complaint.

Ian Hodson, president of the Bakers Union, said the stories exposed in the BBC investigation were "horrific" and had "helped to shine a light on workplace harassment".

"The most important thing to me is the workers," he told BBC News. "Their voices need to be heard. Everyone deserves the right to be safe when they go to work."

Luise Schroter, senior policy officer at the Corporate Justice Coalition, said harassment at McDonald's "must end".

"Workers and their unions are key to ending these systemic abuses and must not be sidelined," she said.

After the initial BBC investigation, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.

But since then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations, while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.

Last January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.

More than 700 current and former junior employees are now taking legal action against the firm.

Kiran Daurka, employment partner at law firm Leigh Day, which is representing the workers, says their clients accuse McDonald’s of failing to protect them.

In November, the equality watchdog said McDonald's would bring in new sexual harassment training for managers in strengthened measures agreed with it to protect its staff from abuse.

At the time, McDonald's said it welcomed the new measures, adding that they would "build on the significant progress we have already made in this space".

Responding to the latest developments, a McDonald's spokesperson said: "We are aware of the NCP's initial assessment and continue to engage constructively with the OECD process.

"We are reviewing the information and considering next steps."

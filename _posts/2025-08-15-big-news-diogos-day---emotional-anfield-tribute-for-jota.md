Liverpool score twice late on to win after Bournemouth fightback

Liverpool winger Federico Chiesa dedicated his side's dramatic win over Bournemouth in their Premier League opener to the late Diogo Jota, describing it as 'Diogo's day'.

Reds forward Jota died at the age of 28 in a car crash in northern Spain in July, alongside his brother Andre Silva, 25.

Emotional tributes were paid before, during and after Friday's 4-2 victory at Anfield - sealed by two late goals for the defending champions - with Mohamed Salah in tears as he applauded the fans at full-time.

Italian Chiesa, who scored Liverpool's third goal in the 88th minute before Salah's added-time effort, told BBC Sport: "[The goal] was a great moment for me, but my thoughts go to Diogo. I think for what we have seen, it was his day. 

"The feeling the fans gave me, chanting his song all the way through the match, it was very emotional, very emotional for me. I have to say that after the goal my thoughts went to his family, his brother Andre. That's the only thing I could say."

With Jota's family in attendance, a rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before kick-off was followed by a period of silence as a fan-led mosaic in the Kop and Sir Kenny Dalglish stand were held up to read 'DJ20' and 'AS30'.

Fans sang "Oh he wears the number 20" in tribute as the players made their way on to the pitch prior to kick-off and in the 20th minute, with a flag in the Kop saying 'Anfield will always be your home'.

Liverpool led 2-0 before Antoine Semenyo struck twice to level for Bournemouth.

"Normally at 2-2 everyone knows which player I look to at that moment in time," said Reds boss Arne Slot.

"I would have loved to bring in Diogo Jota, but I could not for terrible reasons. But the fans and the players did what he did for us many times in the past.

"The main emotion I think should be how impressive and how powerful the tribute for Diogo was.

"I actually didn't want to go in after the game because I found it so special, how our fans reacted today.

"I think Mo felt, after the game, how special that was. He probably also felt the emotion because we all knew his (Jota's) family is here, his wife is here, his children are here.

"For them, it might be special to hear how much he is loved over here. What the fans did. But we also feel the emotions of how much grief they still have."

A moment of silence will be held at all Premier League matches this weekend, with players wearing black armbands, while messages and images will be shown on the big screens in stadiums.

Liverpool's players will have a 'Forever 20' emblem on their shirts and stadium jackets throughout the season.

The Reds won a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title last season with Jota wearing the number 20 shirt, which the club decided to retire after consulting with the former Portugal international's wife Rute Cardoso and family members.

Jota's former club Wolves also have tributes planned for their season opener at home to Manchester City on Saturday.

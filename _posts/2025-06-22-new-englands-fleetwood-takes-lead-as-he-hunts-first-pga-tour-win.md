England's Tommy Fleetwood will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the Travelers Championship in Connecticut. 

The 34-year-old, looking to clinch his first PGA Tour title, had a share of a three-way lead after the second round.

A brilliant seven-under-par 63 on Saturday has given Fleetwood the outright lead over American pair Russell Henley and Keegan Bradley.

"I would love to win on the PGA Tour," Fleetwood said.

"I think it's like an element of your career that everybody wants, and I of course want it."

The Englishman has more top 10 finishes without a victory on the PGA Tour  - 41 - than any player.

"I've been here plenty of times," he said.

"I'm looking forward to it. It's just an amazing opportunity for me to go out and enjoy it, and hopefully it's our time."

Henley catapulted into contention with a blistering nine-under-par 61 that included four birdies in his first six holes. 

The American set a clubhouse score of 13 under but Fleetwood got to 14 under with an eagle on the par-five 13th. 

A birdie on the 15th followed and Fleetwood came close to finishing his round by picking up another stroke.

While world number one Scottie Scheffler slumped to a two-over 72, world number two Rory McIlroy shot a two-under 68, leaving the pair among a group tied for eighth.

The Northern Irishman made four bogeys across the front nine but a double bogey on the 12th set back his hopes of a late charge on Sunday.

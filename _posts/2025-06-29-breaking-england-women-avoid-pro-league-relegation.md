Experts revealed that Elizabeth Neal's goal helped England secure the win they needed to avoid relegation.

England Women's hockey team avoided relegation from the Pro League with a victory over Germany on the final weekend of the season.

A sixth-minute goal from Elizabeth Neal and Sabbie Heesh's save from a penalty stroke with 100 seconds left, was enough to seal the win in Berlin on Saturday, ensuring they would definitely finish above India in the nine-team table.

Germany won 4-2 in the second game on Sunday to secure their own survival, sealing India's relegation and ensuring England end the campaign in seventh place.

England's men were already safe from relegation going to the weekend and also ended the season seventh after losing both games against Belgium.

They were comfortably beaten 3-1 in Saturday's first game in Antwerp, with Jacob Payton scoring their only goal.

Sunday's game was much closer, with Zachary Wallace, Phil Roper, Will Calnan and Liam Sanford on target in a thrilling 4-4 draw.

That sent the game to penalties, but Wallace, Roper and Stuart Rushmere missed their efforts to seal a 3-0 shootout success for the hosts.

The Netherlands had already secured top spot in both the men's and women's competition before the final round of matches.

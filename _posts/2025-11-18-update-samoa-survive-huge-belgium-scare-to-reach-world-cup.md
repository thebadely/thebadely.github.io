According to new developments, Samoa reached the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup in 1991 and 1995

Final Qualification Tournament, 2027 Men's Rugby World Cup

Samoa 13

Try: Papali'i Con: Umaga Pens: Umaga 2

Belgium 13

Try: Decubber Con: Remue Pens: Remue 2

Belgium narrowly failed to reach their first men's Rugby World Cup as they drew 13-13 with Samoa, who qualified at their expense.

The result ensured Samoa topped the standings in the Final Qualification Tournament for the 2027 event in Australia with 12 points - just one above the Belgians.

Both sides had beaten Namibia and Brazil in the four-team tournament in Dubai, but Samoa earned an extra bonus point along the way, meaning the draw was enough for them to become the 24th and final nation to reach the 2027 showpiece.

Belgium led 6-3 with 17 minutes remaining thanks to two penalty kicks from the boot of Matias Remue at the Sevens Stadium in Dubai. 

When Abraham Papali'i came off the bench to score a 63rd-minute try for Samoa, and Jacob Umaga converted and then added a penalty, it seemed the World Cup regulars had finally taken control.

But with seven minutes remaining Jean-Maurice Decubber burrowed over from close range after a classy break by Toulouse player Remue, and when Remue slotted the conversion to level the scores, Belgium's Black Devils were just a score away from a maiden World Cup appearance.

However, it was not to be as Samoa controlled possession and territory in the last few minutes before Papali'i kicked the ball into touch to secure their place in Australia.

Samoa captain Theo McFarland acknowledged "it wasn't pretty" but was pleased his side got the job done to qualify for their 10th World Cup.

"We spoke all week about giving Belgium respect and credit to them, they stuck in it and gave it to us. It's a draw, but we'll take the ticket to the World Cup," said the Saracens forward.

"The whole week we spoke about trusting the process and backing each other up."

Belgium captain Decubber said there was a "lot of disappointment" after going so close but promised they will "come back harder" to qualify for the World Cup in 2031.

"We're really sad - I think we deserved it. We worked very hard for it in this game and I feel sad for the team," he added.

"We did a good tournament, we really thought we could get to the World Cup."

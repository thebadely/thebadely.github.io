It has been recently reported that Darren McHale celebrates scoring Mayo's first goal

Mayo bounced back from an opening day defeat to shock Tyrone 2-17 to 1-13 in their All-Ireland round-robin meeting in Omagh.

Ryan O'Donaghue top scored for the visitors with 1-6 including a second-half penalty while Darren McHale grabbed the other Mayo goal after the first-half hooter had blown. 

Stephen Rochford took charge of Mayo for the game after manager Kevin McStay confirmed earlier in the week that he was stepping back from his role for the immediate future to deal with some personal health issues.

Tyrone came into this one as favourites after their victory over Ulster champions Donegal in Ballybofey seven days ago while Mayo had opened with a home defeat to Cavan a fortnight ago. 

The difference in turnaround times for both sides may have been a factor as the visitors dominated the hosts, who looked flat throughout and struggled on their own restarts. 

Mayo responded well after a turbulent week

Mayo led 0-6 to 0-2 midway through the first half with Rory Brickenden and Ryan O'Donaghue amongst the scorers, but their lead could have been greater as the cut the Tyrone defence open on multiple occasions with O'Donaghue and Aidan O'Shea coming close to goals.

The Red Hands would go 13 and then 12 minutes without registering a score during the first half with efforts from Ben McDonnell and Darragh Canavan stopping the rot. 

But it was Mayo who would lead by eight at the break (1-9 to 0-4), after scoring a late goal.

They held possession for over three minutes before the hooter sounded and Bob Tuohy then had a shot on goal which was spilled by Niall Morgan in the Tyrone goal, allowing McHale to shoot into the empty net. 

Malachy O'Rourke's side needed a response in the second half and got just that with a quickfire 1-2, Darragh Canavan finishing off a fine individual goal before O'Donaghue and Darren McCurry, who took 49 minutes to register a score, exchanged efforts. 

Morgan came forward and nailed a long range free from two-point range to cut the gap to just a single point and when it looked Tyrone had the upper hand, Mayo replied with an unanswered 1-4. 

Their second goal came from the penalty spot after referee David Coldrick adjudged that Ciaran Quinn had pushed Davitt Neary inside the box. 

O'Donaghue stepped up and sent Morgan the wrong way, atoning for his penalty miss in the 2021 All-Ireland decider between the sides to seal victory for the Connacht men. 

That result blows Group One wide open, with Mayo taking on Donegal in a fortnight's time while Tyrone face Cavan with all-four counties having a real chance of advancing beyond the group stage.

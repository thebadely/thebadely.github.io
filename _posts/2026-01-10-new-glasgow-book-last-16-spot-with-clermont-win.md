Investec Champions Cup

Clermont Auvergne (7) 21

Tries: Moala, Penalty, Simone Cons: Plummer 2 

Glasgow Warriors (26) 33

Tries: Ferrie, Jones, Steyn 2, Dempsey Cons: Horne 4 

Glasgow Warriors booked a spot in the last 16 of the Investec Champions Cup with an outstanding bonus-point win at Clermont Auvergne.

Euan Ferrie, Huw Jones, Kyle Steyn and Jack Dempsey crossed in the first half for Glasgow to lead 26-7 at the break, with George Moala's try the solitary Clermont response.

The hosts added a penalty try, Glasgow lost two men to the sin-bin and Irae Simone crossed as the French side threatened a comeback, but Steyn's second try ensured Glasgow made it three bonus-point wins from three in the pool stage.

Warriors host Saracens at Scotstoun next weekend knowing a victory will ensure  top spot in Pool 1, while Clermont face Sharks in Durban seeking their first points in the competition.

Jones, returning from injury to make his first appearance since the Lions series last summer, made a trademark break from deep in the opening few minutes that put Clermont on the backfoot.

A cynical knock-on from Clermont flanker Pita-Gus Sowakula resulted in a trip to the bin and after a succession of penalties, wing Steyn claimed a lineout, from which Ferrie powered over at the back of a rolling maul to give Glasgow the lead.

Jones looked threatening every time he got his hands on the ball and he showed lightning speed to exploit a mismatch in the Clermont midfield and race in for Glasgow's second try.

Franco Smith's side were bossing it and they extended their advantage as Jones dinked a clever kick over the top for Kyle Rowe, who then released Steyn to run in under the sticks.

Clermont finally showed signs of life when Moala burst through to score, but Jones and Rowe combined to send Dempsey over to wrap up the bonus point before half-time.

It was a stroll in the park for Glasgow, until it wasn't. 

Patrick Schikerling and George Horne were yellow-carded for cynical play in preventing a Clermont try, the penalty try was awarded and Warriors were down to 13 men.

The Scots navigated most of the 10-minute numerical disadvantage well, but were carved open by a superb Clermont counter-attack - finished off by Simone - just before their full complement was restored.

From a relative cruise at 26-7, Glasgow's lead had been slashed to five points, setting up a grandstand finish.

Dan Lancaster and Matt Fagerson were held up over the Clermont line as the visitors looked to put the game beyond reach.

They eventually landed the killer blow when substitute Max Williamson went rampaging downfield, before feeding it wide for Steyn to stroll over in the corner.

Clermont threw everything at the Warriors in the final minutes but the visitors soaked it up for yet another statement win in what is shaping up to be a memorable Champions Cup campaign.

Experts revealed that Bob MacIntyre (left) finished seven shots behind winner Scottie Scheffler

Bob MacIntyre said he needed a "hot start" at Royal Portrush on Sunday. What he got in the final round of the Open Championship was a hot finish.

Ultimately, though, his 67 was only enough for a 10-under par total. 

A total that left the Scot seven in arrears of the peerless Scottie Scheffler and tied for seventh place by the time the grandstands emptied.

Having been in a share of sixth in his debut major appearance on this Northern Irish links in 2019, MacIntyre leaves this weekend with a marginally worse outcome, but feeling like he's "streets ahead" of where he was even this time last year.

"I know I've got the game," the 28-year-old said, having added another top-10 here to his runner-up finish at June's US Open. "I feel like it's a matter of time, if I just keep piecing it all together. 

"It's been a great performance and a good result. But it's another reassurance that I'm in the right place."

Final leaderboard at Royal Portrush

MacIntyre had said all week he would have a right good go at it should he be in the mix on the final nine holes of the tournament. 

Four birdies in his final seven holes made good on that vow, even if the circumstances were not what he had dreamed they might be as Sunday unfurled on what he declared to be his favourite course on the Open rota.

The Scot picked up a shot on the second after a long eagle putt halted seductively short of the hole, but handed back that initiative on four.

"Stupit" was his brutal assessment of that bogey, which effectively ended his slender hopes of making a run at Scheffler and the rest of the pack.

Another birdie, this time at seven, was returned to the course three holes later, before MacIntyre found that bit of heat he was looking for. 

Both 12 and 14 brought birdies - the latter when a low chip skittered all the way into the cup - and catapulted him back to the upper reaches of the leaderboard.  

Further red numbers came at 15 and 17, before he rounded off his weekend with par on the last amid a warm reception from the grandstands. 

"I just had to keep saying to myself, 'stay patient, there's a good finish there if you can stay calm'," MacIntyre said.

"There's certain holes this week that were vital, and I played them poorly. But I'm finishing top 10 in a major and being frustrated with certain parts of my game. 

"Things are good, and I've just got to wait my turn."

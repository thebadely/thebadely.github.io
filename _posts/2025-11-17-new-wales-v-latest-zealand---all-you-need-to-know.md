According to new developments, Wales and New Zealand last met in Cardiff in 2022 when the All Blacks won 55-23

Wales will renew a 120-year rivalry when they host New Zealand at the Principality Stadium on Saturday. 

After securing a first win of the Steve Tandy era against Japan, Wales face an All Blacks side smarting from a rare defeat by England. 

The tour Grand Slam may have gone for Scott Robertson's side - who have lost three of their last eight Tests - but they will want to sign off 2025 in style.

Wales are braced for arguably their toughest two weeks of the year with the All Blacks followed by world champions South Africa on 29 November.

Both sides are set to name their teams on Thursday.

The match kicks off at 15:10 GMT and there will be live audio commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC 5Live.

The commentary will also be available on the BBC Sport website where you can follow blow-by-blow action with our live text commentary.

For all the build-up and analysis, make sure to follow the Welsh rugby section on the BBC Sport website.

Wild celebrations but Wales face reality check

Tandy labels red card 'harsh' as Jones slams TMO system 

'I couldn't watch winning kick' - Tandy

Hollie Davidson will make history on the weekend when she becomes the first woman to take charge of an All Blacks game.

She will be assisted by Italy's Andrea Piardi and Gianluca Gnecchi.

Englishman Ian Tempest is the television match official (TMO), with Italian Matteo Liperiniin is in charge of the foul play review process (FPRO).

Wales go into this game having halted a 10-match losing streak at the Principality Stadium with victory over Japan, while New Zealand head to the Welsh capital having suffered their heaviest loss to England in 13 years.

Wales had trailed Eddie Jones' Brave Blossoms until the 82nd minute when Jarrod Evans kicked the match-winning penalty and clinched only a second victory in 21 Test matches.

But it was a far from convincing performance with Josh Adams' 20-minute red card adding to Wales' disciplinary woes.

New Zealand have also suffered disciplinary problems of late. Following three yellow cards at Murrayfield, hooker Codie Taylor was sin binned as the All Blacks saw an early 12-0 lead whittled away by England at Allianz Stadium.

Leicester Fainga'anuku and Taylor had crossed for the visitors before a George Ford-inspired England hit back with four tries in a convincing 33-19 defeat.

Wales face the New Zealand haka in their 2003 meeting

Since their first meeting at Cardiff Arms Park back in 1905, New Zealand have utterly dominated this fixture having won 34 out of 37 matches against Wales.

Wales won that first encounter 3-0, but have won just twice more and not registered a victory since 1953.

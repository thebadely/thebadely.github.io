Scorecard

Ireland saw off a Pakistan rally to win the first of the three-match women's Twenty20 international series by 11 runs at Clontarf Cricket Club in Dublin.

Following a 3-0 T20 series victory against Zimbabwe last month, the hosts carried that momentum forward as they made a winning start to this latest series.

Pakistan won the toss and put Ireland in to bat with Amy Hunter posting 37 before being bowled by Nashra Sandhu.

The hosts had lost Gaby Lewis for just one as Fatima Sana took the first of her four wickets, but 29 from player of the match Orla Prendergast kept Ireland ticking before Sana made the catch from Rameen Shamim.

Leah Paul was out for 28 as Sadia Iqbal took her wicket before Sana removed Laura Delany - who hit Ireland's only six - on 16.

Ireland's innings appeared to be collapsing when Rebecca Stokell was removed by Diana Baig on 12, but they managed to set a target of 142.

Pakistan's innings got off to a slow start as Muneeba Ali was gone for five as Prendergast took the first of her three wickets.

Jane Maguire celebrated her 50th cap by bowling Gull Feroza for five, but the tourists rallied with Sidra Ameen and Aliya Riaz both posting double figures before being removed by Ava Canning and Cara Murray respectively.

Pakistan's middle order began to carry the fight with Natalia Pervaiz hitting 29, which included her side's only six, before Prendergast ended her afternoon.

Sana contributed 14 with Shamim on 27 before she became the second to fall to Maguire as Pakistan's hopes of a winning rally faded.

The teams meet in the second game at the same venue on Friday.

Experts revealed that Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the youngest player to play in the Indian Premier League

Fourteen-year-old batter Vaibhav Suryavanshi has been named in India's Under-19s squad for this summer's multi-format tour of England. 

The teenager hit the headlines in April when he became the youngest player to score a century in a men's T20, smashing 101 runs from 38 balls as Rajasthan Royals beat Gujarat Titans by eight wickets. 

His knock, which included seven fours and 11 sixes, was the second fastest hundred in the Indian Premier League - and fastest by an Indian player - coming from 35 balls. 

In total, Suryavanshi has scored 252 runs at a strike rate of 206.55 in seven appearances for the Royals and previously hit  a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.

Sabalenka confident 'Battle of the Sexes' won't damage women's sport

Aryna Sabalenka says her controversial Battle of the Sexes-style match against Nick Kyrgios will not damage women's sport.

Sabalenka, the women's world number one and four-time major champion, faces 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Kyrgios in an exhibition match on 28 December.

The event will be held in Dubai and shown live on the BBC.

Some people see it is as harmless entertainment between two high-profile players, but others believe it could belittle the women's game if Sabalenka loses.

Asked if it could be damaging, Sabalenka told BBC Sport: "I don't agree.

"I am not putting myself at any risk. We're there to have fun and bring great tennis. Whoever wins, wins."

She added: "It's so obvious that the man is biologically stronger than the woman, but it's not about that.

"This event is only going to help bring women's tennis to a higher level."

Belarusian Sabalenka, 27, has been one of the standout players on the WTA Tour over the past few seasons, capping another marvellous season by winning the US Open in September.

Kyrgios, 30, played only five professional matches in 2025 as he attempts to rebuild a career which he feared would be ended by a wrist injury.

The controversial Australian is ranked 672nd in the world and many have questioned what Sabalenka stands to gain from the event.

The concept is the brainchild of the pair's shared agent Stuart Duguid, who said the players will "do fine" financially from the match but that money is "not what is driving this".

It is not known if the winner will receive a cash prize or both players will get appearance fees or a share of revenue.

"It's not going to be an easy match for Nick," Sabalenka said.

"I'm going to be there competing and showing women are strong, powerful and good entertainment.

"He's in a lose-lose situation. I'm in a win-win situation."

Why 'Battle of the Sexes' exhibition is polarising opinion

In 1973 Billie Jean King faced Bobby Riggs in a match dubbed the 'Battle of the Sexes', attracting a worldwide television audience of 90 million and going down in cultural folklore with the aid of a Hollywood depiction.

King's victory over former Wimbledon champion Riggs - a self-proclaimed chauvinist aged 55 - was a landmark in the fight for gender equality and laid the path for equal pay at the top of the game.

With WTA players now among the world's highest-paid athletes, critics argue that this latest iteration of the 'man versus woman' format is unnecessary.

But Kyrgios and Sabalenka say it will attract a new audience to tennis, with their promises of more entertainment and celebrity fans sitting courtside.

"Tennis doesn't really have that (razzmatazz) that often and I think that when something like this occurs it is pretty special," said Kyrgios.

Sabalenka said: "We are helping tennis to grow.

"It's fun, it's challenging and I think that's what people want to see."

Critics have questioned Kyrgios' suitability as the male protagonist, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.

Last year Kyrgios shared a post from controversial influencer Andrew Tate before later distancing himself from the self-proclaimed misogynist.

Asked if he understood the criticism given his previous behaviour, Kyrgios told BBC Sport: "Of course. But that's what life is. You make comments when you're younger and you change."

The former world number 13 said he is a "different person" now, adding: "I'm not going to sit here and say I'm an amazing role model, but I've grown and I'm definitely more mature now."

Kyrgios said he has not given "a thought" to the possibility he could become a poster boy for misogynists ready to criticise women's sport if he beats Sabalenka.

"This is the only thing I'm good at - hitting a ball over a net and giving people a show," he said.

"So I can't do anything other than hope me and Aryna play our best tennis and, at the end of the day, whoever wins, that our handshake afterwards solidifies the union between males and females in the tennis world."

Kyrgios, who has been open about his alcohol and drug abuse in the past, said he is not concerned about losing face if he is beaten by Sabalenka.

"I'm never worried. I know how I've responded with things in my life," he said.

"This is all a bonus. I've lost tennis matches before, so it's not really a big deal."

Kyrgios said he sees the event, as well as recent exhibitions in Atlanta and New York alongside Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka, Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul - as crucial preparation for a fuller return to the ATP Tour in 2026.

A knee injury means he has not played on the tour since the Miami Open in March, but he said there are "real positive signs" in his fitness.

Let's dive into the details: Chances are you know someone coughing and spluttering - hopefully not directly on you -  right now. 

There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds. 

But why now, how do you know if it's a cold, covid or so called "'super flu" - not an official virus, but a term referring to flu that has come earlier than usual this year.

So how can you spot the difference and avoid the worst?

Research on the extent to which cold weather impacts our immune systems remains unclear.

But darker days mean we typically make a beeline for warm, cosy, indoor spaces.

And this environment is perfect for viruses.

It's also when young children get back together at school after the summer holidays.

School and nursery can be like a petri dish with lots of viruses circulating and they may well bring these germs home with them.

The same applies to freshers in university halls - where mixing together spreads germs, while heavy drinking and partying further weaken the immune system.

NHS leaders are already warning that the UK is facing a difficult flu season.

Flu has hit a month earlier than normal, with a newly mutated version of the virus circulating.

Vaccines still work against this drifted influenza A(H3N2) "subclade K" flu that some are calling "super flu".

Covid

Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and Covid, overlap, says Medical doctor Dr Oscar Duke, who is also a regular TV presenter including on the BBC's Morning Live.

But there are some clues that might help you identify the exact culprit.

If a cold's coming on, then it often does so gradually. 

It's going to affect your nose and the back of your throat, while some will get a tickling at the back of the mouth.

Another early warning sign can be a build-up of pressure in the ear. 

If the virus spreads further, it can reach your lungs and cause a pesky cough.

Mostly however, these symptoms don't stop us from carrying on as normal.

The same can't be said for flu, which typically adds aches, fevers and muscle weakness into the mix. 

Flu doesn't mean you have to go to bed, but it might make you feel that way, says Dr Duke.

Since the pandemic, Covid has complicated things further, with similar symptoms to flu.

But one key Covid-specific identifier can be a loss of smell or taste. Another, seen with newer variants Stratus and Nimbus that are still around, is a "razor-sharp" sore throat. Diarrhoea is also common.

The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. 

However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice.

Our bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. 

Dr Duke says it's crucial to take the free annual flu jab if you're offered it.

Eligibility is staggered across the population to prioritise those most at risk.

If you have small children who were two or three on 31 August this year, then they are entitled. Older children will be offered theirs at school.

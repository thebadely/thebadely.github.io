According to new developments, Pictures from yesterday's protest in London in support of Palestine Action feature heavily on the front pages.

The Sunday Times shows an 89-year-old woman being lifted up and removed by police. She is quoted as saying "we are having our right to peaceful protest taken away".

The Sunday Telegraph says a former detainee of the US military prison, Guantanamo Bay - Moazzam Begg - was also arrested.

The whole of the Observer's front page is taken up by an image showing scores of protestors sitting down in Parliament Square. "The sound of silence" is the headline.

The Sunday Express says "thousands of riot police" are on "on alert" across the country. The paper highlights what it calls "anti-migrants rallies" as well as the protests related to Palestine Action.

The Sunday Mirror focuses on the government's plan to deport "thousands more foreign criminals". The paper says under the measures, they would be "booted out after sentencing" rather than get what ministers have described as "free bed and board" in British prisons.

The Mirror's editorial has welcomed the measure, saying it will save taxpayers "shedloads" of money.

The Shadow Justice Secretary, Robert Jenrick, has told the Mail on Sunday that he fears for the safety of his three young daughters, because of the small boats crisis. The paper says his warning follows what it calls a "spate of asylum-seeker sex crimes".  Jenrick has written a piece for the paper, in which he says he doesn't want his "children to share a neighbourhood with immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally".

The Sun on Sunday says Liam Gallagher has flown his brother Paul - who is facing charges of rape - to an Oasis concert in Edinburgh on a private jet. The paper says the singer is also letting the 59-year-old stay at his "Â£4m" home in London. A source says Liam "wants to be there for his big brother." Paul Gallagher's lawyer says he denies the allegations against him.

A former close friend of the Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury, has told the Sunday Times of her "total disbelief" about claims he had a secret lovechild. The paper says the claim about the daughter is in a book due to be released next month. Mary Austin has called the suggestion "astonishing".

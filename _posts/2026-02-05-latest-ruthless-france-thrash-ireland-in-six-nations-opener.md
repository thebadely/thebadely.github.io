Ruthless France inflicted more pain on Ireland as the Six Nations holders opened their title defence with a bonus-point victory at a buoyant Stade de France. 

Having crushed Ireland's title hopes in emphatic fashion in Dublin last year, Les Bleus - with returning captain Antoine Dupont pulling the strings - roared into a 22-0 half-time lead following a one-sided first half that was not without controversy. 

France's first try was scored by the electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey, but only after what appeared to be a forward pass in the build-up. 

Matthieu Jalibert and Charles Ollivon also crossed in the first half, before 2025 top try-scorer Bielle-Biarrey's stylish second secured France's bonus point seven minutes after the interval. 

At that point, France looked poised to surpass the 42 points they managed in Dublin last year, but Ireland refused to give in and narrowed the deficit with tries from replacement forwards Nick Timoney and Michael Milne.

The hosts, however, had the final word when Theo Attissogbe capped a thoroughly satisfying evening for the tournament favourites.

The Irish leave the French capital bruised and empty-handed and must regroup in time to face Italy in Dublin on 14 February, with France travelling to Wales the following day.

There's a 'hell of a lot of work to do' - Farrell reaction to Ireland loss

With an extensive injury list, this was always going to be a big ask for Ireland.

Severely depleted at both prop positions and without potential gamebreakers like Hugo Keenan and Mack Hansen, Farrell's hand was weakened before he brought his squad back to the scene of their agonising World Cup quarter-final loss to New Zealand in 2023.

But even if Ireland feel hard done by calls that did not go their way, there is no question they were simply outplayed at times by a scintillating French outfit driven on by a delighted Parisian crowd.

While Ollivon's knock-on denied France a second-minute try, Bordeaux speedster Bielle-Biarrey beat Jamison Gibson-Park, rode Sam Prendergast's tap tackle and ghosted past Jacob Stockdale to finish a move that featured a suspected forward pass from Nicolas Depoortere to Yoram Moefana.

The high-intensity, unstructured nature of the game suited France's fleet-footed backline, but it was an Irish defensive lapse that led to the home side's second try.

After Tommy O'Brien was forced to dot the ball down in the Irish in-goal area and concede a scrum, Dupont - making his Test return after suffering a serious knee injury against Ireland 11 months ago - popped the ball to Jalibert for the fly-half to mark his first international appearance since last year's Six Nations with a well-taken try.

With Ireland already on the ropes, Ollivon surged past Caelan Doris and slid across the whitewash to give the hosts a commanding halfway lead.

It was also the first time Ireland were held to zero points in a first half since 2020.

When Bielle-Biarrey scampered clear for his second - after a Dupont chip and outrageous volley with the outside of his left boot from Thomas Ramos - and France's fourth try, Ireland looked on course to be on the end of one of their heaviest defeats.

But a gutsy second-half display - that echoed November's chaotic defeat by South Africa - allowed them to at least get a few scores on the board, with Timoney finishing after a line-break from his Ulster team-mate Stuart McCloskey. 

Then replacement tight-head prop Milne marked his Six Nations debut when he burrowed over after another McCloskey surge.

A third Irish try would have stirred French nerves but, while Farrell's side applied pressure, France's defence stood firm, allowing their backs to finish with a flourish as Attissogbe crossed in the corner to complete a miserable Stade de France return for Ireland.

Without established Test veterans Uini Atonio, Gregory Alldritt, Damian Penaud and Gael Fickou, this was a glimpse into France's destructive potential. 

For Ireland, however, they face into a difficult week following their autumn losses to New Zealand and South Africa with another humbling reverse against a fellow member of the world's top five.

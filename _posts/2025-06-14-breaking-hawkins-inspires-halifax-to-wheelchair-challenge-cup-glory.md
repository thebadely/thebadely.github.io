Reigning Golden Boot winner Rob Hawkins inspired Halifax Panthers to their first Challenge Cup final win for seven years.

The England international scored two first-half tries and added seven conversions as London Roosters, in their first final, were kept at arm's length throughout a bruising encounter at Robin Park Sports Centre in Wigan.

Panthers dominated this competition in the past, winning the first four, but had not made the final since 2018.

Hawkins, named the world's best player by the International Rugby League last year, also set up a try for fellow England player Jack Brown as the West Yorkshire side racked up eight tries.

Roosters hit back as Mason Billington, one of two London players due to be involved in Sunday's Future of England match to decide the squad for the Australia tour this autumn, scored two of their five tries.

Hawkins and Brown have already been selected for that squad and they combined beautifully to open the scoring, with 2019 Golden Boot winner Brown finishing after Hawkins' superb pass out of the back of his hand.

Roosters' Joe Coyd is another who has already booked his place on the plane to Australia, and he hit back with a try.

Panthers then eased to a 30-16 half-time lead as Hawkins scored twice inside six minutes, with Wayne Boardman and Joe Calcott also going over.

Roosters stayed in with a chance, with Coyd forcing the award of a penalty try when he had his shirt pulled as he threatened to go over, and Lewis King cut the deficit with another just before the interval.

Any doubt about the result was removed when Finlay O'Neill scored the first try after the break, and after Billington had somersaulted in for a spectacular try, Jordan Holt and Tom Martin set the seal on it, although Billington had the final say for Roosters with another powerful score.

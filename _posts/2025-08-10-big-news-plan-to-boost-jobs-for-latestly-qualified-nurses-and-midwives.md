According to new developments, New measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to take on newly qualified nurses and midwives have been announced by the government.

The move comes after warnings there are up to three times more graduates than vacancies in some areas of the health service.

The aim is to free up trusts in England to recruit more easily by cutting red tape and simplifying regulations, including allowing them to employ staff based on what they think they might need and before vacancies formally arise.

The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the move but said the test would be if students could actually find jobs. Employers said it was not clear how the new measures would be fully funded.

Health officials said there were 4,000 more nursing and midwifery graduates than vacancies. This is out of a total of 24,870 who have already graduated or are due to over the next six months.

New measures would also see some support worker posts be temporarily converted to midwifery roles to create new openings for graduates.

The Department of Health said the changes would tackle concerns about jobs after record numbers chose to train for NHS professions during the pandemic â€“ with fewer nurses and midwives quitting. 

Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: "It is absurd that we are training thousands of nurses and midwives every year, only to leave them without a job before their career has started. 

"I am sending a clear message to every newly qualified nurse and midwife. We're here to support you from day one so you can provide the best care for patients and cut waiting lists."

The Royal College of Nursing general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger said she welcomed the news, noting it should "provide hope to students", but added a note of caution.

"When the health service urgently needs nursing staff, it was absurd to leave people in limbo," she said. "The test of this will be if students can find jobs, vacant posts are filled, and patients receive the care they deserve."

Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: "We're pleased that the government has listened to the voices of student midwives who are desperate to start their career, only to find those opportunities blocked. 

"I know today's announcement will come as a relief to student midwife members."

But it was not clear in the announcement what extra money there might be for employers already under pressure to cut costs. 

Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents trusts, said it was good that staff concerns were being addressed - but added that there were questions over the finances.

He said: "It's not clear how this will be fully funded, nor what it could mean for other staff groups facing similar challenges.

"Trust budgets are already under enormous pressure. There is no spare money."

The health union Unison said ministers should also deal with a lack of opportunities for new graduates in occupational therapy as well as paramedics and other professions.

The College of Paramedics says there is a "serious graduate employment crisis," with up to 40% of new graduates unable to find a job.

The College described this as "shocking" and said it was "unacceptable" to design policy for one profession without considering the impact on others.

The attempts to make it easier for newly qualified nurses and midwives to get jobs comes at a time of a growing row with the government over NHS pay in England.

The Royal College of Nursing is calling for talks with ministers over pay issues after a consultative ballot of members showed a large majority opposing the 3.6% pay award. Future strike action has not been ruled out.

Another health union, the GMB, has said there will be talks on Monday at the Department of Health after its members also came out against the wage award in a ballot.

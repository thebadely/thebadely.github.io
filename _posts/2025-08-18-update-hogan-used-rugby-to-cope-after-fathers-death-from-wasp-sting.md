It has been recently reported that Hogan lost her father Eamonn in June 2023

Ireland back row Brittany Hogan said she has used rugby as a way to cope with the grief of losing her father suddenly in 2023.

Ahead of her first appearance at the Women's Rugby World Cup, Hogan has opened up about the impact of her father's and grandfather's deaths and how the support of her team-mates helped her get through a difficult time.

"I lost my dad two years ago and then my grandad in August. They were two father figures in my life that are gone, and I am playing for them," the 26-year-old told BBC Sport NI's Orla Bannon.

"My dad got stung by a wasp on the way home from work and went into anaphylactic shock. He had to pull over in the car and my little sister was calling people to help, so without her or the help of the air ambulance, we wouldn't have been able to say goodbye.

"It was traumatic and tragic, it was a hard period of time, but we've had a few more sudden deaths in the group, and we've grown to know how to deal with it and we rallied around each other."

Hogan, who took up rugby at 15 after being told she was "too aggressive" to play other sports, says she and other team-mates who are dealing with grief will aim to make their bereaved family members proud at the World Cup in England next month.

"I didn't really take time off after their deaths because rugby waits for no one," she added.

"We have to train and it's about being able to look after each other off the pitch away from training is the most important thing. 

"My dad came to as many games and tournaments in the year before he died that he could, so I have good memories, and I'll never forget him."

Huge relief, big losses and bolters - Ireland name World Cup squad

Ireland begin their Pool C campaign against Japan in Northampton on Sunday (12:00 BST).

Scott Bemand's side then face Spain on 31 August and holders New Zealand on 7 September in their remaining games.

Having been a part of the squad that missed out on qualification for the last World Cup in 2021, Hogan - who has 34 caps - says reaching the tournament this year is a relief and that Ireland are aiming to get out of their group.

"We've had our fair share of ups and downs but it shows Ireland is a resilient nation. We pride ourselves on being a resilient and hard-working group and the last two years has shown we are getting our rewards," she explained.

"Our target and we have openly said, is to get to London and to a semi-final. 

"We are hoping to get two wins in the Pool stage but we're under no illusion that every team has worked four years to get here, so we know how hard these matches are going to be, but also how hard we have worked to get here."

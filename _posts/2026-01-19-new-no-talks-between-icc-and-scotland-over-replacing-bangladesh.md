Here’s what you need to know: Scotland have been captained by Richie Berrington since June 2022

The International Cricket Council have not held any talks with Scotland about replacing Bangladesh at next month's men's T20 World Cup - but Scottish players would be ready if the call came.

Bangladesh have told the ICC they will not travel to India for the T20 World Cup next month amid political tensions between the two countries, and have requested their matches be moved elsewhere.

Scotland are the highest ranked team not taking part in the tournament, which would put them in the frame to take Bangladesh's spot should the ICC decide to replace them.

However, BBC Sport has been told the ICC have not contacted Cricket Scotland at this stage to discuss whether they would be willing to step in.

Equally, Scottish cricket officials are not planning to initiate talks with the global governing body out of respect to their counterparts at the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).

A fourth-place finish at last summer's Europe Qualifier cost Scotland a place at the 2026 T20 World Cup as the Netherlands and Italy secured the two spots on offer for the region. 

Scotland's players are currently back in training, though, as they prepare for a one-day international tri-series with Namibia and Oman in Windhoek in March.

It has been reported that a final call on Bangladesh's participation in the T20 World Cup, and if they willing to travel to India for the event, is set to be taken by Wednesday.

BBC Sport has approached the ICC for clarification of the criteria used to determine a replacement in the event of a team either pulling out or being expelled from the tournament.

Zimbabwe withdrew from the 2009 T20 World Cup in England for political reasons and were replaced by Scotland who were the 'next best' team in a pre-tournament global qualifying tournament.

But with qualifying for T20 World Cups, which were expanded to 20 teams in 2024, now done on a regional basis it is not quite so straightforward and is likely to be a discretionary decision by the ICC.

Scotland are currently 14th in the ICC T20 rankings.

The ICC could move Bangladesh's matches to a less politically sensitive part of the country, or switch their games to co-hosts Sri Lanka.

It had been reported by ESPNCricinfo, external that the ICC had received a request from the BCB to swap groups with Ireland, who are due to play all their games in Sri Lanka. 

A Cricket Ireland spokesperson told BBC Sport they "have been assured" that "no changes are being made" to their schedule but they are monitoring developments closely.

It has been recently reported that The government has announced plans to crack down on dodgy cosmetic practitioners in England who it says are exploiting people and causing harm.

Under the new proposals, only qualified health professionals will be able to carry out risky non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) and clinics will need to meet strict rules to obtain licences to offer fillers and Botox.

Under-18s will also be protected from potentially dangerous beauty trends on social media with age restrictions on certain procedures.

The industry has welcomed the plans, although the government says it now needs to consult further to figure out exactly how this will work in practice.

There has been concern over the lack of rules in parts of the non-surgical cosmetic industry for some years.

Many procedures, such as liquid BBLs, are marketed as non-surgical but are invasive and carry serious risks, experts say.

Non-surgical BBLs are one of the most high-risk procedures which involve filler being injected into the buttocks to make them bigger, more rounded or lifted. 

Women have told the BBC of dangerous complications, pain and permanent scarring after treatment by rogue operators. 

In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die in the UK after receiving this unregulated procedure.

The government says it will bring in regulations for the most dangerous procedures first - such as breast fillers and BBLs - which means only some qualified health professionals will be able to perform them.

Rules on who can offer lower-risk treatments such as lip fillers, Botox and facial dermal fillers will also change. A licensing scheme run by local authorities will require practitioners to meet strict safety, training and insurance standards before they can operate.

However, it could still be several years before any of these measures comes into force. The plans will be subject to public consultation and must go through Parliament before they are introduced.

Health Minister Karin Smyth said the industry had been plagued by "a Wild West" of "cosmetic cowboys causing serious, catastrophic damage".

She said the government was taking action to protect people, support honest practitioners and root out the unqualified, dangerous ones, while also reducing the costs to the NHS of fixing botched procedures.

"This isn't about stopping anyone from getting treatments. It's about preventing rogue operators from exploiting people at the expense of their safety." 

A public consultation in 2023 demonstrated widespread support for tighter regulation across the industry.

Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, a register of approved clinics and practitioners, said she had seen first hand "the devastating impact these procedures can have on the lives of victims and their families".

"I am delighted that the government has recognised the significant and potentially fatal risks posed by highly dangerous procedures like liquid BBLs, and has made it a priority to implement restrictions to protect public safety."

There are thought to be around 16,000 businesses involved in non-surgical cosmetic procedures, which have seen a huge boom in popularity in recent years.

The Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners (JCCP) said ensuring all cosmetic practitioners were regulated and licensed, appropriately insured and worked from safe premises had become "imperative".

"These proposals have our full support and we welcome the opportunity to engage in further consultation," says JCCP executive chair Prof David Sines. 

Health officials are currently investigating 38 cases of poisoning following suspected fake Botox injections.

The public is reminded to make sure they only use registered and qualified practitioners and use products licensed for use in England.

The Scottish government recently set out measures to improve the safety and standards of the non-surgical cosmetic procedures industry, following a consultation.

Let's dive into the details: Keegan helped Liverpool win their first European Cup in 1977

Former England striker and manager Kevin Keegan has been diagnosed with cancer. 

The 74-year-old had an illustrious playing career which included spells at Liverpool, Hamburg, Southampton and Newcastle United, while he twice won the European Footballer of the Year award.

Keegan moved into management after ending his playing career and had stints in charge of Newcastle United, Fulham, England and Manchester City.     

"Kevin was recently admitted to hospital for further evaluation of ongoing abdominal symptoms," his family said in a statement.

"These investigations have revealed a diagnosis of cancer, for which Kevin will undergo treatment.

"Kevin is grateful to the medical team for their intervention and ongoing care.

"During this difficult time, the family are requesting privacy, and will be making no further comment."

Newcastle put a message out to "King Kev" on social media, saying, "We're with you every step of the way. Hoping for a full and speedy recovery".

Speaking before the Magpies played Leeds United on Wednesday, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe told Sky Sports: "Really sad news. Kevin is an absolute icon of this football club, not just as a player but as a manager. An inspirational figure. 

"I've been lucky enough to meet him a few times. He's been so kind and generous with his time and his words for me. We wish him well, the whole city is behind him and with him every step of the way." 

Howe added post-match: "We want to produce a similar team [to Keegan's Newcastle]. We want everyone to be desperate to come and watch the team and stick with the team right until the end because you never know what's around the corner. 

"You never know how a game can end. With Kevin's team, that was certainly the case. 

"We want that to be the same with us and we want supporters to love the team in the same way."

Liverpool said "the thoughts and support of everyone" at the club were with Keegan.

"All of us at LFC and official former players association Forever Reds send our best wishes to Kevin, his family and friends," added the Anfield side.

"Sending our strength and love to Kevin and his family at this time," said Manchester City.

The Football Association, Premier League and a host of other clubs also sent Keegan messages of support.

Keegan started his playing career as a 17-year-old at Scunthorpe United in 1968 before being signed by legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly three years later.

He helped the Reds to the top-flight title three times and also won the 1977 European Cup - the club's first in the competition and in his farewell season - an FA Cup and two Uefa Cups in his time at Anfield.

Keegan scored 100 goals in 323 appearances for Liverpool and joined German club Hamburg in 1977.

He was their top scorer with 17 league goals when they claimed the Bundesliga title in 1978-79, while he was named European Footballer of the Year in both the 1977-78 and 1978-79 campaigns during his three-year spell.

Keegan moved to Southampton in 1980 and was the PFA Player of the Year in 1981-82 before making the switch to Newcastle in 1982 and retiring as a player two years later.

The forward, who played at the 1982 World Cup, scored 21 goals in 63 appearances for England and captained his national side 31 times.

Keegan's first foray into management came with Newcastle in 1992 and he led the club to the second-tier title and promotion into the Premier League in 1993.

In the 1995-96 season, his Newcastle side let a 12-point lead slip as they were beaten to the top-flight title by Manchester United where he famously said, "I would love it if we beat them", in an emotional outburst during the tense run-in.

Known for producing an attacking brand of football, Keegan resigned as Magpies manager in 1997 and took over at Fulham a year later, before being appointed as England boss in February 1999.

He left that role in October 2000 following a 1-0 defeat by Germany in a 2002 World Cup qualifier - the final game at the old Wembley Stadium before it was rebuilt.

Keegan, though, returned to club management with a four-year spell at Manchester City prior to a short eight-month stint back at Newcastle in 2008.

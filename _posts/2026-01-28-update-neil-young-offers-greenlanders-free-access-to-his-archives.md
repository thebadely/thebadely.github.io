Here’s what you need to know: Canadian-American rock star Neil Young is offering Greenlanders a year's free access to his archives in what he hopes will "ease some of the unwarranted stress and threats" they are receiving from the Trump administration. 

President Donald Trump has threatened to annex the Danish territory for what he says are national security reasons, though recently walked back comments, saying he was seeking "immediate negotiations" and insisting he "won't use force". 

Young is known for his political protests, and has long been a vocal critic of Trump. 

He announced the offer "of peace and love" on his website, where he added that he hoped "other organisations will follow in the spirit of our example." 

In his statement, signed "love earth", Young refers to the Trump administration as "our unpopular and hopefully temporary government".

Access to Young's digital archive usually starts at around $25 (£18), depending on the subscription package. To secure free access, a Greenland registered mobile phone number will be required for verification.

Earlier this month, Young wrote on his website: "Wake up people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes... He has divided us." 

In 2020 Young took legal action to try to stop Trump using his music at campaign rallies.

Young has also called on people to boycott Amazon over owner Jeff Bezos's donations to the Trump campaign and support for the administration. 

In 2024, Young ended a two-year boycott of streaming giant Spotify, which he had started in opposition to the platform streaming Joe Rogan's podcast.

In 2022, he told Spotify to remove hits like Harvest Moon and Heart of Gold, complaining that Rogan was spreading vaccine misinformation on the streaming service. 

Other artists, including Joni Mitchell and India Arie, also removed their songs in solidarity.

The singer said at the time that his return did not reflect a reversal of his stance, but that the decision came after Rogan signed a $250m (£181m) deal to make his podcast available on multiple platforms, rather than remaining a Spotify exclusive.

Neil Young was born in Canada but later moved to the US and holds dual citizenship.

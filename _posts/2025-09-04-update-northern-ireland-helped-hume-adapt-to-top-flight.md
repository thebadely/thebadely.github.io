Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sunderland defender Trai Hume will captain Northern Ireland in their opening two World Cup qualifiers in Luxembourg and Germany

Sunderland defender Trai Hume says playing international football for Northern Ireland helped him adapt to the Premier League. 

Hume joined Sunderland from Irish Premiership side Linfield in January 2022 when they were in League One and has helped guide the club back to the top flight.

He made his Northern Ireland debut two months after moving to England, and will captain Michael O'Neill's side in their opening World Cup qualifiers in Luxembourg and Germany.

"It probably has helped me in a way to get used to the top players, that top level and how concentrated you have to be in the game for the whole 90 minutes," said the 23-year-old, who has played in all three of Sunderland's opening Premier League matches this season.

"I've always said I wanted to test myself at the highest level so getting the chance to do that this season is a dream come true. 

"Hopefully I'll just keep playing games and keep being able to do that."

Two paths, one dream - how duo reached Premier League

After he helped Sunderland win promotion to the Premier League through the play-offs, Hume was linked with a move away from the Stadium of Light but he signed a new long-term contract in August.

Hume said he was aware of interest from clubs in England and Europe but it was "always on my mind" to agree a new deal.

"Ever since I signed for the club in League One I've loved every second of it," said the former Linfield defender. 

"It does feel that wee bit better that you've helped Sunderland from where they were in League One, the whole way up to where we belong.

"Obviously you can sign for a Premier League club and it's still the same thing, you're still getting to play in the Premier League, but it does bring that extra bit of emotion into it that you've done it the whole way through.

"Our plan this season is to stay there and keep pushing on."

Hume made his Northern Ireland debut in 2022 and has won 22 caps

Northern Ireland start their World Cup qualifying campaign in Luxembourg on Thursday and face Germany in Cologne on Sunday.

Manager Michael O'Neill rotated the captaincy through the Nations League campaign last year and in the friendlies to start 2025, and has handed Hume the armband for September's double-header.

"I'm really proud and happy to do it, but I've always said that when I wear the armband it doesn't really change much for me," said Hume.

"I'll obviously try my best to do the job at hand and help my team-mates."

Northern Ireland faced Luxembourg in the Nations League campaign last year and, after going two goals up in November, were pegged back to a draw - which was still enough to earn promotion from League C.

Hume says recent experience shows it will be "be a tough game", despite the hosts being the lowest-ranked side in Group A, which also contains Slovakia.

"We've played them twice very recently in the Nations League and we know it won't be an easy game. 

"We drew 2-2 in our last game here, so it's one we are fully focused on and prepared for."

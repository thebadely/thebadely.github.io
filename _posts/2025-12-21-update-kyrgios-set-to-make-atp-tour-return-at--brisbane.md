It has been recently reported that Nick Kyrgios lost to Novak Djokovic in his only Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in 2022

Nick Kyrgios is in line to play his first ATP Tour match in 10 months after being given a wildcard entry for next month's Brisbane International.

Fitness issues have restricted the Australian to just five singles matches in 2025, with his most recent a second-round defeat to Karen Khachanov at the Miami Open in March.

Before Brisbane, he will return to the limelight when he faces women's world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a Battle of the Sexes-style exhibition match on 28 December.

The match, which has divided opinion, will be shown live on BBC One.

The 30-year-old will also compete in the Kooyong Classic warm-up exhibition event in âMelbourne in January as he works towards a potential return to the Australian Open.

Kyrgios has suffered a string of serious injuries in recent years and has seen his world ranking drop to 673.

He has no protected ranking so will âalso âneed a wildcard to compete at the first Grand Slam of 2026.

The former Wimbledon finalist has played just one Grand Slam match since 2022 - a first-round defeat by Britain's Jacob Fearnley at Melbourne Park in January.

Here’s what you need to know: The British Basketball League folded in 2024 and was replaced by Super League Basketball

Basketball's world governing body Fiba has suspended the British Basketball Federation (BBF) and barred the men's team from international competition because of governance issues.

A Fiba taskforce was set up in August to investigate "regulatory non-compliance" within British basketball.

In April, the BBF awarded a 15-year licence to run a new professional men's competition - the Great Britain Basketball League - to GBB League Ltd (GBBL).

The BBF said GBBL, a consortium led by the American businessman Marshall Glickman, would provide Â£15m funding in the first two years. 

However, the existing nine Super League Basketball [SLB] clubs claimed the tender process run by the governing body was "illegal and unjust" and refused to join the new league.

The clubs launched legal action against the BBF in the high court, while UK sports minister Stephanie Peacock reportedly asked the government body responsible for elite funding, UK Sport, to investigate the allegations.

In a statement, Fiba said it had completed a "comprehensive review of the situation, including interviews and meetings with basketball stakeholders".

Under the terms of the suspension, the BBF will not be permitted to licence or recognise national men's competitions, or field a men's national team in Fiba senior competitions.

The taskforce will now "engage directly with basketball stakeholders and the UK government to explore and propose an interim operational framework for the top-tier men's national competitions".

The statement added: "These measures aim to restore regulatory integrity and promote sustainable governance of men's basketball in Great Britain as soon as possible."

Sports minister Peacock said she was "deeply concerned by the news".

"While it is a relief that the GB women's team is not included in this suspension, work must clearly be done to fix the domestic game and ensure our teams can continue to compete on the world stage," the minister said. 

"We will work closely with Fiba and other partners on the interim operational framework, using this as a moment to move forward as we start the process of addressing governance concerns and protecting the future of British basketball."

On Sunday, the BBF announced the resignation of chairman Chris Grant after three years because of "personal reasons".

Its interim chair Grace Jacca said in a statement on Wednesday: "We understand the disappointment that players, staff and fans alike will be feeling. 

"Our immediate priority is to continue working with our key stakeholders to maintain stability while contributing constructively to the process with Fiba."

BBF added that the GB men's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania, which was scheduled to be held in London on 27 November, will not go ahead.

According to new developments, The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was used at the 1932 and 1984 Games

Los Angeles will become the first city to incorporate two stadiums into an Olympics opening ceremony when it hosts the Games in 2028.

Both the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the SoFi Stadium will host the event on 14 July 2028, organisers of LA28 have confirmed.

The Coliseum, which was used at the 1932 and 1984 Olympics, also hosts the closing ceremony on 30 July and becomes the first venue to hold events across three Games.

The SoFi Stadium, home to NFL sides the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, will host the Paralympics opening ceremony on 15 August with the event closing at the Coliseum on 27 August.

"The venues selected for the 2028 opening and closing ceremonies will highlight Los Angeles' rich sporting history and cutting-edge future, showcasing the very best that LA has to offer on the world stage," LA28 chair Casey Wasserman said.

"These two extraordinary venues will create an unforgettable experience, welcoming fans from across the globe to an Olympic and Paralympic Games like never before and concluding what will go down as one of the most-incredible Games in history."

Details of the opening ceremony, including how the two stadiums will be used, are yet to be confirmed.

The Coliseum, which is home to Collegiate American football side the USC Trojans, will hold the track and field events during the first week at the Olympics.

The SoFi Stadium is set to host the swimming competitions in week two.

A number of sports have been reinstated at the Olympics in Los Angeles following an absence from the Games, including cricket, lacrosse and squash, while flag football will make its debut.

It has been recently reported that Jack Draper has never won a Grand Slam

British number one Jack Draper has withdrawn from forthcoming tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati because of an arm injury.

But the 23-year-old is targeting a return at the US Open, which begins on 24 August.

Draper, who reached the US Open semi-finals in 2024, said on social media: "After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious.

"I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season."

The Canadian Open gets under way on 26 July, while the Cincinnati Open starts on 4 August.

Draper was knocked out of Wimbledon in the second round as he lost in four sets to Croatia's Marin Cilic.

He is not the only big name to withdraw from the Canadian Open, with Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic also confirming they will not play.

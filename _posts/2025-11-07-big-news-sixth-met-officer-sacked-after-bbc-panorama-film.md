Let's dive into the details: A Metropolitan Police sergeant who said a detainee "deserves to be beaten up" has become the sixth officer based at Charing Cross police station to be sacked following a BBC investigation.

Lawrence Hume, a detention sergeant, was dismissed on Friday at an accelerated misconduct hearing, which also heard he used a derogatory term to describe the detainee.

October's Panorama programme showed officers calling for immigrants to be shot, revelling in the use of force and being dismissive of rape claims.

Cdr Simon Messenger said Sgt Hume had "demonstrated a blatant disregard for the protection of the public and the professional standards expected of a serving police officer".

Cdr Messenger told the hearing in south London: "It is right he has been dismissed as we work tirelessly to raise standards and improve the culture across our organisation."

In a six-minute clip, which was played to the panel several times, Sgt Hume also said of the same detainee, "Charge him, send him to prison, throw away the key," adding, "Don't care, deserves to be beaten up don't he."

Panel chairman Cdr Jason Prins found Sgt Hume's behaviour amounted to gross misconduct and dismissed him without notice.

Cdr Prins said the sergeant was "unable to provide a satisfying answer" as to why he had said a detainee deserved to be beaten up.

"He made the comments on two occasions unprompted," Cdr Prins added. "He was in a leadership position responsible for the welfare of detainees."

An allegation that Sgt Hume's comments indicated a clear intention to minimise and not record levels of force used in custody was found to be unproven.

On 28 October, Sgt Clayton Robinson was dismissed after a panel heard he had "trivialised the allegation" of a woman during a rape investigation and "mocked the victim" by singing a song with another officer.

PC Jason Sinclair-Birt was dismissed on 24 October after being secretly filmed "boasting about and revelling in the use of force" on a detainee.

A day earlier, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg were dismissed after allegations of gross misconduct were upheld.

Sgt McIlvenny was filmed being dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegation of rape and domestic violence against her partner and making misogynistic comments.

PC Neilson was recorded referring to an "invasion" of "scum" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia.

Another three officers - PC Sean Park, PC Brian Sharkey and Sgt Steve Stamp - are due to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings in the wake of the 1 October broadcast.

A further allegation against Sgt Hume, that he had failed to challenge or report Sgt McIlvenny's remarks after being informed of them, was also found to be unproven.

Amanda Rowe, director at the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said Sgt Hume's comments were "unacceptable and completely unprofessional".

She added: "A panel has found that the officer breached the police standards of professional behaviour relating to authority, respect and courtesy, and discreditable conduct, and it's right that he has been dismissed from the force."

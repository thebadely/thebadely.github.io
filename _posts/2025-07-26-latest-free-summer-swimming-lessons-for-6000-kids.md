Let's dive into the details: More than 6,000 children across Wiltshire will be eligible for free swimming lessons this summer as part of a pilot scheme.

The lessons have been made available to children who are part of Wiltshire Council's FUEL programme, as well as pupils in secondary schools who received free school meals.

Up to 10 lessons will be provided at council-run leisure centres with a pool, such as Marlborough Leisure Centre and Calne Community Campus.

Councillor Jon Hubbard, cabinet member for education at Wiltshire Council, said "a few pennies behind the sofa" helped pay for the scheme.

Mr Hubbard told BBC Radio Wiltshire the extra money for the swimming lessons cost Â£45,000, and money had been used from Public Health England funding and the children's services budget.

"For some of our young people who have six or seven weeks at home without school, having these positive and fun activities for them to go and take part in is a really important thing we offer", he said.

"I want them to have fun. I want them to have positive activities to be able to look back on and say, 'that was a really cracking time we've had'. 

"And to have made new friendships, had a positive experience and something they can build happy memories."

He said schools would have told parents whether they were eligible, and sent out an invitation for the FUEL programme.

Parents of children eligible for free school meals needed to show proof of the entitlement at a pool.

Wiltshire Council said the scheme would be reviewed in autumn after it finished.

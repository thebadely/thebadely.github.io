Home favourite Robert MacIntyre won the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in testing conditions to become the first Scotsman in 20 years to lift the title. 

MacIntyre, 29, carded a third round of 66 to finish on 18 under par in the weather-affected championship, only a week after helping Europe secure a dramatic Ryder Cup triumph in New York. 

The tournament was decided over 54 holes after play was wiped out on Saturday because of strong winds during Storm Amy. 

Having also won the Scottish Open last year at The Renaissance Club, MacIntyre follows in the footsteps of Colin Montgomerie, who was the last Scotsman to win the Alfred Dunhill in 2005. 

MacIntyre's Ryder Cup team-mate Tyrrell Hatton finished second, four shots behind the Scot, after a seven-under round on Sunday.

World number nine MacIntyre, who earned one and a half points for Europe in their Ryder Cup triumph at Bethpage Black, now has four European Tour wins.

"It's brilliant but I don't know how I'm going to celebrate after the celebrations we had last Sunday, but we'll try our best," MacIntyre said.

"It's a beautiful end to a good week. I've done everything against the book this week. I only pitched up here on Wednesday and had 12 holes. 

"The diet has not been good this week and I've eaten plenty of takeaways, fish and chips and plenty of others.

"But sometimes when you least expect it, things happen."

MacIntyre made a fast start to his final round with a birdie on the first hole and reached the turn at four under par. 

The Scot hit a precise approach from the rough on the 13th to stay in control of the leaderboard and - despite a bogey on the 17th and a missed birdie putt on the 18th - did enough to seal the win.

South Africa's Richard Sterne, who shared the lead at the start of the day, faded to finish third at 13 under, alongside England's John Parry.

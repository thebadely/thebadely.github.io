Let's dive into the details: Thelwell was speaking on his first day in the job of sporting director at Rangers

New sporting director Kevin Thelwell says Rangers' manager search is "progressing well" and should be complete in "the coming days".

A consortium of investors led by Andrew Cavenagh and 49ers Enterprises established majority ownership at Ibrox last week and the club are seeking a replacement for Philippe Clement, who was sacked in February.

Barry Ferguson took on head coach duties on an interim basis, with Rangers finishing last season 17 points behind Scottish Premiership champions Celtic.

Davide Ancelotti and Russell Martin are believed to be the frontrunners for the vacancy.

"This is a new chapter for Rangers, and while we recognise success won't come easy, our goal is clear: we need to win," Thelwell told the club website.

"My focus is on delivering that, with discipline and ambition. We'll give everything to move this club forward as quickly and sustainably as we can."

When announcing his appointment in April, Rangers said Thelwell will "assume overall responsibility for all areas of the football operations, including men's, women's and academy".

The 51-year-old held similar roles at Wolverhampton Wanderers and New York Red Bulls, while he arrives in Glasgow after three years as director of football at Everton. 

On Sunday, it was also revealed Everton's former head of recruitment Dan Purdy will work alongside Thelwell as technical director, replacing Nils Koppen.

Thelwell has already been appointed to the SPFL competitions working group for 2025-26 and will serve on the league body's compensation tribunal working group too.

Meanwhile, Ibrox chief executive Patrick Stewart is to stand for election on to the SPFL board on 24 June.

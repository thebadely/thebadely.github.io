Let's dive into the details: Ellis Genge, far left, uses smelling salts before a game against Wales in March 2020

Rugby's authorities have no immediate plans to follow American football's NFL in banning 'smelling salts' over concerns they may mask concussion symptoms.

Smelling salts - a pungent mix of ammonia, water and ethanol - are marketed as improving mental alertness or boosting energy.

One study suggested that by irritating the nose and lungs, they stimulate a sharp intake of breath and a short-term rush of oxygen to the brain.

However, in a memo to their teams, obtained by the Associated Press,, external the NFL warned smelling salts also "have the potential to mask certain neurological signs and symptoms, including some potential signs of concussion".

Their use is common in high-level rugby dressing rooms.

During half-time of the first British and Irish Lions' Test against Australia last month, Lions flanker Tadhg Beirne was shown inhaling smelling salts as the rest of the team huddled up.

Video of his use of smelling salts, and team-mate Jack Conan's reaction, were used on the team's social media., external

Team-mate Ellis Genge has previously used them directly before England matches, while Premier League footballers have been pictured apparently using them on the pitch.

While the issue is likely to be considered by World Rugby's advisory panel of concussion experts at their next scheduled meeting in September, there is no intention to convene to discuss smelling salts before then.

World Rugby has improved diagnosing concussion in the elite game with the introduction of instrumented mouthguards that trigger an alert, and a mandatory check when a collision exceeds a certain level of force and pitchside doctors monitoring video of incidents.

A battery of physical and memory tests, baselined against individual pre-season scores, is used in unclear cases to decide whether a player has suffered a concussion or if they can return to the field.

There are no explicit rules about the use of smelling salts by players before they undergo the assessment. However, the results and players' symptoms are reviewed by an independent doctor.

While a group of former rugby players have brought a legal action against the game's authorities claiming they were not adequately protected from a brain injury, there is a greater awareness of concussion and its dangers among current players.

Ireland centre Garry Ringrose withdrew from the British and Irish Lions starting line-up for the second Test in Australia, telling coaches that symptoms from a head knock a fortnight earlier had recurred.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Irish singer CMAT has announced she will postpone her sold-out UK tour scheduled to begin today.

In a social media post, the 29-year-old rising star said she requires urgent dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth.

"I currently can't even open my mouth wide enough to laugh let alone sing," she told her followers.

Ticket holders will be offered a rescheduled concert date or a refund.

CMAT, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, was due to play in London on Thursday on her Euro-Country tour, following the release of her third album in August.

She was scheduled to perform in Manchester, Glasgow, Leeds, Newcastle, and Glasgow over the coming week. 

Thompson confirmed she would cancel her upcoming concerts after learning she had an infected wisdom tooth.

"I realise that this will cause difficulties for so many of you who may have made plans to travel to these dates," CMAT wrote on Instagram.

"And for this I can only say I am so so sorry."

A dentist informed her she required surgery to remove both lower wisdom teeth next week, for which she'll need to spend at least two weeks recovering.

The Irish singer said she cannot "chew any food" and "can barely think straight" due to the pain.

Rescheduled dates for the October leg of CMAT's tour will be announced "as soon as possible", the singer said.

Her UK tour is due to wrap up in March before she performs in Europe and at the 2026 Coachella festival.

She performed at Glastonbury earlier this year, where she spoke to the BBC about her experience of online fat-shaming after a festival performance the year before.

Euro Country, the title track from the singer's new album touches on the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis in Ireland.

BBC Radio 1 was pushed to clarify it did not edit out the Irish language intro to the single in its first broadcast of the song in July after 45 seconds of the song were not played on air. 

The station said it had played the version provided to them by CMAT's label, AWAL.

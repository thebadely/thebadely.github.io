It has been recently reported that Beth Potter won the 2023 World Triathlon Championship series

Britain's Beth Potter claimed her second gold in two weeks to become joint leader in the World Triathlon Championship series.

After claiming her first 2025 gold in the Czech Republic, the 33-year-old's second successive win in Weihai, China, puts pressure on 2024 series champion Cassandre Beaugrand of France, with the pair tied on 2925 points.

No one in the women's section apart from Potter and Beaugrand has topped the podium twice this series, meaning their fates lie in their own hands as they head into the grand final in Wollagong, Australia next month.

Potter took the finish tape 16 seconds ahead of second and third-placed German duo Lisa Tertsch and Tanja Neubert, after quickly building a gap at the front during the first of four laps of the 10km run.

The Paris 2024 double bronze medallist held the lead, allowing her to ease off for the victory lap and comfortably cross for her second series gold. 

"I'm just thinking about myself, about my race processes and I'm really happy with that," Potter said.

"I don't take winning for granted so it's great to back up my win in Karlovy just 12 days later.

"I'm feeling quietly confident and good in myself, trusting the training and it's coming good."

In hot, humid conditions in Weihai, Potter's compatriot Sophie Alden earned a sixth-place finish on her debut at this level while in the men's race, Jack Willis and Connor Bentley ran in 11th and 13th respectively for Great Britain.

"Beth once again delivered a masterclass and showed that she's getting right back to her very best," British Triathlon performance director Mike Cavendish said.

The 2025 World Triathlon Championship series will conclude in Australia on 15 October.

Here’s what you need to know: Darwin Nunez of Liverpool, left, and Alexander Isak of Newcastle

The Saudi Pro League is emerging as a possible destination for Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez this summer.

BBC Sport understands that a potential move to the Middle East for the Uruguay international has been explored this summer with intermediaries actively working on trying to broker a deal.

Al-Hilal, who are controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and coached by former Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi, are interested in Nunez.

And offloading Nunez would financially aid Liverpool's efforts to land striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle - another club owned by PIF - this summer.

So, would PIF be allowing one of their clubs to benefit at the expense of another if Al-Hilal sign Nunez?

Liverpool prepared not to pursue Isak deal further

There is some uncertainty over whether Nunez, 26, is prepared to leave European football at this stage in his career.

Nunez has also been a target for Italian champions Napoli this summer while other European sides have shown an interest.

PIF owns 75% stakes in four of the leading Saudi Arabian clubs, including Al-Hilal, while it also owns a 80% stake in Newcastle.

The Magpies rejected a Â£110m bid from Liverpool for Isak on Friday, with Newcastle valuing the Sweden international at about Â£150m.

"It makes me think about what the priority is for PIF," Newcastle fan writer Charlotte Robson told BBC Sport.

"More and more discontent has been felt in the fanbase lately over where Newcastle sit on PIF's list of priorities, and allowing another of their clubs to benefit at the potential expense of us feels even more like we are being overlooked.

"Perhaps it's their clever way of getting money into NUFC, but I think most fans would say we'd rather an improved contract was given to Isak, the dust of the summer settles, and he stays with us a little while longer."

However, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says Liverpool can afford to buy Isak regardless of whether Nunez stays or leaves.

"Although they've been very active in the transfer window, if they really wanted to, they could have spent another Â£200-250m, and still would have been within the PSR [profit and sustainability rules] limits," he told BBC Sport.

Liverpool have signed Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili and Armin Pecsi for a combined total of about Â£265m without add-ons.

However, the departures of Luis Diaz, Jarell Quansah, Caoimhin Kelleher and Trent Alexander-Arnold have recouped an initial Â£115m.

Maguire added: "I think people are joining the dots and perhaps making two plus two equals five in terms of, is this a 'you scratching my back? I'll scratch yours' type of situation. But in my view, there's insufficient evidence to back that up.

"I suspect that Liverpool are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this, rather than a PIF club. Newcastle don't want to sell Isak.

"As far as Al-Hilal are concerned, there are plenty of strikers that they could have bought. It just so happens that Nunez is effectively available, and therefore they decided to pursue that as an option."

Isak joined Newcastle in a Â£60m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022.

He was the club's top scorer last season as they won the Carabao Cup, ending their 70-year wait for domestic silverware.

The 25-year-old, who was reported as wanting to explore a move away from Tyneside by BBC Sport in July, was left out of the club's pre-season tour of Asia with what the club called a "minor thigh injury".

Last week, the Sweden international trained alone at his former club Real Sociedad amid ongoing uncertainty about his future, although sources say he returned to Newcastle training on Monday.

His boss Eddie Howe said Isak must "earn the right" to train with his squad again and, speaking to the Newcastle Chronicle, said he had not spoken to the forward since Liverpool lodged a bid.

The Newcastle boss, speaking before he travelled back home with his squad from South Korea, added that Liverpool, as far as he was aware, had not been back in touch since making their offer.

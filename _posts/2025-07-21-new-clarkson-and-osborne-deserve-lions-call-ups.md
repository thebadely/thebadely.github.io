It has been recently reported that Clarkson and Osborne are in line to make their Lions debuts against a First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne on Tuesday

British and Irish Lions assistant coach Simon Easterby said that Thomas Clarkson and Jamie Osborne "fully deserve" to be included in the squad against a First Nations and Pasifika XV on Tuesday.

The Leinster duo were late call-ups to the Lions squad as cover after featuring in Ireland's summer tour.

Osborne will make his debut at outside centre, partnering captain Owen Farrell, whilst Clarkson is amongst the replacements and Easterby believes their displays for club and country merit their inclusion. 

"It goes without saying the quality of those two individuals. Tom has fought through a pretty tough position at Leinster, never mind in the Irish squad, and he's put in some brilliant performances," he said.

"Jamie has had a brilliant couple of years. The performance he had in South Africa last summer and his performance for Leinster playing 12, 13 or wing, it's pretty impressive the positions he can cover and the quality he brings.

"I'm really pleased for the two of them, they fully deserve being here and I have no doubt they will perform tomorrow."

The Lions starting team does not include any of the players who featured in the first-Test win against Australia.

Easterby dismissed the idea that Tuesday's game is a "distraction" ahead of the second Test against Joe Schmidt's side on Saturday.

Instead, he urged the players that are involved to take the Pasifika game as a chance to force their way into Andy Farrell's plans with a good performance at the Marvel Stadium.

"The players know there is an opportunity there," Easterby added.

"Faz [Andy Farrell] in his selection overall has given guys opportunities based on the performances they have created on tour.

"I believe the group is so competitive at the minute and I don't think that will be any different with the prize of featuring in the second or third Test."

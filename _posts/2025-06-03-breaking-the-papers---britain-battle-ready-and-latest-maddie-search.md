It has been recently reported that Several front pages focus on the new searches in Portugal by detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, 18 years after she vanished while on holiday there.

The Telegraph says the operation is believed to be a "final push" to secure evidence needed to bring the prime suspect Christian Brueckner to court.

The Daily Mirror says officers will scour rural land close to his former home with "wells, ruins and water storage tanks" among the places set to be examined.

According to The Sun, ground-penetrating radar will be used to search trenches dug for works that were taking place at the time the three-year-old went missing, but have since been filled in.

The Times reports on a call from Sir Tony Blair for Britain to lead the way with AI doctors and nurses or risk being left behind in what he describes as the biggest upheaval since the Industrial Revolution.

The former prime minister made the comments at a festival in London where he urged the government to embrace artificial intelligence in every department, warning the UK couldn't afford to be squeamish about the technology.

The paper says the technology secretary Peter Kyle told the same event he was willing to take risks on AI because it was a greater risk to resist change.

With the headline "Tory warnings over backdoor blasphemy law", the Daily Mail highlights concerns expressed by Kemi Badenoch, following the conviction of a protestor who burned a copy of the Koran.

It says the Conservative leader believes the case should go to appeal after she said she would defend freedom of belief and freedom not to believe until her dying day.

When asked about the case last night, the prime minister's spokesman said there were no blasphemy laws in England and there were no plans to introduce any.

The Guardian claims to have learned that the recent airstrikes on school buildings being used to shelter displaced Palestinians in Gaza are part of a deliberate bombing strategy by the Israelis and more schools have been identified as targets.

It says the Israel Defence Forces insists it operates on the grounds of military necessity and within international law.

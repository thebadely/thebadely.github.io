Experts revealed that Scammers are already targeting pensioners who are hoping to get their winter fuel payments restored, Communities Minister Gordon Lyons has warned. 

It comes a day after it was confirmed the payments, which the government stopped for millions of pensioners across the UK, have now been reinstated.

Lyons told the Northern Ireland Assembly he is aware of a number of "scams in circulation", in which pensioners are being contacted and asked for their banking details.

He said it is "disgraceful" that people are "trying to take advantage of pensioners" less than 24 hours after the payments were restored. 

The minister reminded those who are in line for the payments that the money will be paid out automatically, and there is no need to provide details or fill out application forms.

He also reassured assembly members that pensioners in Northern Ireland will receive their payments at the same time as others across the UK.

Detailing how the scheme will work, he said legislation will be passed by the end of July that will clear the way for payments to be made before the winter.

He stressed there will be no additional cost for the Northern Ireland Executive as the money will be provided from London.

He said only those pensioners who earn £35,000 or less will be eligible.

On Monday, payments of up to £300 per household for those over 80 and £200 for those under 80 were confirmed for Northern Ireland.

In England and Wales, payments will be made to all pensioners before HMRC will recover money from those earning over £35,000 through taxation.

Winter Fuel Payments were created in 1997 to help everyone above state pension age with their winter heating bills.

The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced last year that winter 2024 would be the first time pensioners in England and Wales would not be eligible for the payment.

Northern Ireland was forced to follow suit.

Payments were then restricted to those on benefits and pension credit.

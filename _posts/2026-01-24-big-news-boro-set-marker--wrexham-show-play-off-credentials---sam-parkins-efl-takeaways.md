It has been recently reported that After another dramatic Saturday turned up plenty of action, former Swindon, Ipswich and Luton striker and BBC Final Score pundit Sam Parkin gives his takeaways from what we learned across the Championship and rest of the EFL.

Middlesbrough boss Kim Hellberg has overseen eight wins from 13 games in charge of the club

There were two 4-0 wins in the early games in the Championship on Saturday as Middlesbrough showed their promotion credentials by thumping Preston North End while Millwall swept aside Charlton Athletic at The Den to keep pace at the top.

Parkin: "I thought the Middlesbrough game would be tighter against a Preston team who's had a really good season, but I think the recent form played out really.

"That's a fourth win in a row for Middlesbrough, and Preston have lost their past four and they're struggling to find the net.

"I thought if there was a flaw in their set-up in comparison to the other top teams - namely Coventry City and Ipswich Town - it might be the amount of goals that they're likely to score.

"But it's really timely that Tommy Conway has started scoring and Morgan Whittaker's made an incredible difference as well.

"They're in a brilliant place at the moment. They're playing some great football and they've come through a tough week with some tough games by winning at Stoke and beating Preston so convincingly, which is not to be sniffed at.

"For Millwall, I think it's the most depth they've had in recent years with loads of exciting attacking players.

"They've been able to get Macaulay Langstaff and Josh Coburn in the line-up together, and Aziz has had an incredible season as well and played a part in their first goal.

"They've got a great opportunity this year, probably the best opportunity they've had in recent times to get in the play-offs and potentially the Premier League."

Ipswich Town's defeat at Sheffield United ended a seven-game unbeaten run in all competitions which included six victories

Off the back of Middlesbrough's early win against Preston, Ipswich were stunned by Sheffield United, who were reduced to 10 men late on, as they lost ground on the Championship automatic promotion places.

Parkin: "I think it was always going to be a tough game for Ipswich today at Sheffield United. They've got a few players missing through injury and they've got a massive month ahead.

"That's the only thing I can see derailing Ipswich - they've got to play seven games in February with the FA Cup and a rearranged game.

"So the squad will be tested. I think they've probably got the numbers to do it, but when, comparatively, some teams would play five or six games [in February] it does have a little bit of an effect.

"They're going to have to deal with a fixture pile-up but the way they're going, especially at Portman Road, I don't think today's result will affect them too much.

"I still have Ipswich probably just slightly out in front of Middlesbrough, which sounds strange speaking after such a convincing Boro win and a disappointing afternoon for Ipswich, but I just think that depth will prevail in the long run.

"Sheffield United have picked up under Chris Wilder and they'll probably be looking at the table tonight and thinking that potentially they could go on a run and make it in the play-offs themselves with so many games to play for."

Phil Parkinson has led Wrexham to promotion in three successive seasons

Wrexham moved sixth in the Championship table courtesy of their comeback win at QPR. Phil Parkinson led the Hollywood-owned club to three promotions in a row, and a morale-boosting win in the capital will have their fans dreaming of a remarkable four from four as they barged into the play-off picture.

Parkin: "Wrexham are in great form at the moment. With 10 minutes to go it looked like they were going to leave with nothing from QPR, so to turn it around and sneak into the top six tonight, that'll be a great journey home for the supporters and the players.

"I think the reality of the situation is, with that cluster of teams that are hoping to get into the play-offs, they've got the financial backing to add a few more players at the end of the window.

"They've got a quality squad as it is but if they could add a couple of savvy signings then we could be talking about another promotion or at least another play-off campaign, which would be absolutely incredible.

"I think everyone probably had maybe Birmingham slightly in front of where Wrexham were at the start of the season in terms of their potential in the Championship, so it's flip-flopped a little bit in their favour.

"But as we see in so many seasons, that final play-off position, even though it seems a long way away, seems open for someone, and why not Wrexham? They've certainly got the squad to do it."

Harry Clifton had scored Doncaster's third goal against Wigan to put them 3-0 up on Saturday... but the Latics fought back

Wigan certainly needed a boost having strayed close to the League One drop zone after a chastening home loss to Bolton Wanderers last week. Latics boss Ryan Lowe said Saturday's trip to fellow strugglers Doncaster Rovers was not a six-pointer, but his side were forced to come from behind to rescue a 3-3 draw across the Pennines.

Parkin: "Doncaster's home form in particular has been really indifferent, so it was a little bit of a surprise to see them in that lead.

"I wouldn't have envisaged Wigan getting back into it because they don't strike me as the most free-scoring. I know that they lost narrowly to Bolton in a local derby but it's a position in the league I didn't see them being in.

"Hopefully, they can use that as a catalyst to rise up the table. They're the afternoons that stick with you as a player. When you come back from 3-0 behind - I think I did it once in my career - the memories in the dressing room are really amazing days.

"So being in a terrible position, that dressing room would be really elated at full-time."

Nicke Kabamba has scored nine goals in 27 league appearances for Bromley this season

In League Two, Bromley and Swindon Town - the top two at the start of the day - played out a thriller with the Ravens edging out Ian Holloway's side, while Cambridge United stunned Tranmere Rovers to move up to fourth. Just four points separate second and seventh as the promotion race hots up in the fourth tier.

Parkin: "The top of League Two is one of the most exciting areas of the EFL at the moment. I just think there's so many good teams and so many different teams.

"You have the underdog story of Bromley, of course, who are out in front and earned a massive victory over Swindon, and I don't think you can underplay that.

"Nicke Kabamba got the winner and that's nine goals he's scored, with seven as a substitute, which just shows what a brilliant signing he's been.

"Cambridge, likewise, are on an incredible run with their budget. I'm sure they're operating with one of the lowest in comparison to teams around them like Salford and MK Dons.

"Karl Robinson has really got Salford going, and then you see Walsall as well who, yes, dropped points this afternoon, but they were play-off finalists last year and have re-built a really competitive squad this year.

"I just think you literally cannot predict who's going to be in the top three. It's so open, so exciting, and it's set up brilliantly for the last few months of the season."

Sam Parkin was talking to BBC Sport England's Jay Freeman.

'He's my hero' - Harri Deaves on Ospreys defence coach Justin Tipuric

Flanker Harri Deaves has no shortage of role models at the Ospreys.

The 24-year-old will pack down this season in the same back row as not just one but two British and Irish Lions in Jac Morgan and Ross Moriarty.

But it is the region's new defence coach who Deaves says is his hero.

Justin Tipuric, a Lion himself, switched to the role after retiring last season.

"He's the epitome of a good human," said former Wales Under-20s international Deaves.

"If you bumped into him and someone didn't know who he was, he would never tell you he was a rugby player or anything like that.

"He's my hero because when I was selected for Wales Under-18s I had a signed Grogg [a hand-crafted statue] of him."

Seismic change or plan B? What now for Welsh rugby?

Both Deaves and Ospreys head coach Mark Jones are full of praise for Tipuric in his new role.

"His transition into coaching has been seamless but I think everyone would have predicted that," said Deaves.

"You could tell when he was a player that coaching was for him because he's experienced in the game massively.

"The way he talked and held himself, spoke and led was phenomenal. That's the exact same person he is when he's coaching."

Jones said: "He [Tipuric] hasn't got to build any relationships, they are all there from his playing days.

"He's got to make different calls, have different conversations with players, he'll do that in his own way and is doing it in his own way and he's slotting in nicely."

Tipuric won 93 caps for Wales and was selected for three successive British and Irish Lions tours

Deaves picked up from where he left off last season, impressing in Ospreys' opening round defeat by Bulls in the United Rugby Championship (URC).

And Jones believes that continued good form has put him in Wales contention.

"I'd be surprised if he [Deaves] is not in the international conversation right now," said Jones.

"If you look at his post-contact metres, he's the highest in our squad. He beats defenders and wins collisions in his own way, not just with brute force.

"He's got a good skillset and is super aggressive. They're all the traits you associate with an international player."

Deaves, who still coaches at his hometown club of Pontyclun, said a Wales call would be reward for defying the odds during his early career.

"I was a late developer and playing in a tough position, always being called too small and stuff like that," said 5ft 11in (1.80m) Deaves.

"The size of my heart had to take over sometimes and I'd like to say that still carries on now.

"It's about making my village proud, I love representing my village and giving back to my family. [But] I just need to focus on where I am right now."

Bevan French kept Wigan on course for a hat-trick of Super League titles as two tries from the Australian star helped Warriors overcome Leigh to reach the Grand Final.

French's first-half double, plus some superb defence in the second period, settled a thunderous contest at the Brick Community Stadium.

It was a repeat outcome to last season's play-off semi-final but, while Wigan cruised to a 38-0 victory 12 months ago, Leigh made the Warriors work much harder this time around.

They put their neighbours under serious pressure at times but in the end last season's quadruple winners had the composure to book their place at Old Trafford.

Wigan will face the winners of Saturday's second play-off semi-final between Hull KR and St Helens in the Grand Final on 11 October.

After a chaotic build-up, which involved a row over ticket allocations, the visitors made the early running.

They had a touchdown by Owen Trout ruled out in the sixth minute with referee Chris Kendall's on-field decision of no try standing with video referee Tom Grant unable to find any evidence to the contrary with Harry Smith underneath him.

It was Wigan who took the lead against the run of play in the 14th minute through French after a mistake by Bailey Hodgson. The Leigh full-back spilled possession in a double tackle by Liam Byrne and Liam Farrell and Adam Keighran put French in for a walk-in.

The Leopards hit back in the 28th minute through an unlikely source as Robbie Mulhern crossed for his first try in 19 months. Mulhern took a low ball close in from Edwin Ipape superbly in the difficult conditions to storm over without a finger laid on him.

However, the Papua New Guinea international coughed up a penalty when he blocked French's line as he chased Smith's high ball and Keighran slotted the kick to nudge Wigan into the lead.

And eight seconds before the break, French blazed over for his second try after man-of-the-match Jai Field made the insertion in midfield and fed the supporting stand-off.

From there it was the Warriors' rearguard which decided the outcome.

Trout looked odds on to score after breaking through just after the hour but a brilliant cover tackle from Field saved the home side.

It summed up Wigan's defensive resolve and they finished the job with the final play as French put Sam Walters over as the Warriors reached a record-equalling 14th Grand Final.

Wigan head coach Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I thought it came down to some big moments. The Jai Field cover tackle, Adam [Keighran] forcing that error on the kick chase early onâ¦ we scored one fantastic try and that's all it is.

"It's a lot of people doing the boring stuff really well.

"You've got to peak at the right time. For me it means I get to see people I love the most in the world having a great week and hopefully we are successful."

Leigh head coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:

"Obviously the end result hurt us a little bit but I loved the effort and you know we never gave up.

"It's hard to think 'there goes another opportunity' but we've just got to stick to our processes and know that the hard work is getting us to a place that we want to be.

"We're a lot more physical now than what we've ever been and we're close. We're really really close."

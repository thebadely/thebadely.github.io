According to new developments, After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): Wonderful performance. It says 2-0 on the scoresheet, but if you watched the game it felt like Newcastle had the better chances. An xG of 2.18 for Newcastle and they didn't score so that comes down to him. 

Ian Maatsen (Aston Villa): He hasn't actually been a regular. He does so much going forward for Villa with his crossing. He's not really known for his defending but I thought he shackled Harvey Barnes and put him in his back pocket. 

Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest): The Brentford team he faced are well known for getting crosses in from the wide areas. I thought he defended excellently at the far post in Forest's 2-0 win, cleared everything. He was good at dealing with how people tried to run at him. He offered a lot going forward, too.

Marc Guehi (Manchester City): I know it's Wolves, so he gets a little less credit, but to instantly come in and get a clean sheet, you just saw the togetherness he brings. A lot of pressure on him going into a game where they have to win. He comes in and City get their first clean sheet in the Premier League since 1 January.

Jorge Cuenca (Fulham): A lot of people talk about Joachim Andersen and his range of passing. Cuenca is just steady and goes about his business, but he's always in control, never out of position - and again against Brighton. Very talented player.

Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. He's slowly become Villa's most important player. He dictates the play, breaks it up, and does everything right. Very, very good player and that pains me to say as a Birmingham City fan.

Ibrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): Lost him during Afcon and it wasn't the same midfield. He is a pitbull next to Elliot Anderson; he does all of the ugly stuff and breaks it up. A fantastic footballer and part of a solid defensive unit, which obviously Forest needed.

Emiliano Buendia (Aston Villa): Scored unbelievable goals, all vital for their team's attacking outlet. Buendia, for me, just showed that little bit of class and magic. I love to see players taking a risk.

Patrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He's been unbelievable since Michael Carrick came in. That goal in the win at Arsenal was unbelievable and worthy of winning any football match in the world.

Estevao Willian (Chelsea): Young, exciting player and got a goal and assist, but it was against Crystal Palace, so he doesn't get as much chat as the others.

Igor Jesus (Nottingham Forest): In a weekend of strikers not being great, he was solid and Forest had two that ended up scoring. He battles and does all the ugly stuff well, and then he has that little bit of flair for his goal.

Nuno Espirito Santo (West Ham): A 3-1 win over Sunderland is huge - it gives West Ham a chance to stay up. If you look at the wins for Forest and now the draw for Leeds, West Ham would have been completely cut adrift. They've now given themselves a chance to get out of it. He gets that because of the biggest win of the weekend.

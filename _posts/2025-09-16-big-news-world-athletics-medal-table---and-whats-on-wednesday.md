Experts revealed that Josh Kerr is going for back-to-back 1500m world titles

Wednesday is day five of the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

Great Britain could win their first medal of the championships, with defending champion Josh Kerr in action in the 1500m final alongside 2022 champion Jake Wightman and Neil Gourley. 

Medals are also on the line in women's pole vault, men's long jump, and the women's 3,000m steeplechase. 

Elsewhere, there's plenty of British names to look out for on the track. 

Daryll Neita, Amy Hunt and Dina Asher-Smith are in action in the women's 200m heats while Zharnel Hughes and Toby Harries are competing in the men's equivalent. 

The men's 400m hurdles semi-finals will feature Tyri Donovan and Alastair Chalmers while Emily Newnham is in the women's 400m hurdles semi-finals.

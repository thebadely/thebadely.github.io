According to new developments, Living abroad while at university allowed me to become almost fluent in two other languages and have experiences that would never have been possible in Scotland.

While studying at the University of Glasgow in 2021, I moved to Germany aged 19 to work as an English language assistant for nine months - partly funded by the Erasmus scheme.

But just months earlier, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson had pulled the UK out of the scheme as part of a deal to leave the European Union.

The funding lasted until 2021-22, which meant I was in the last cohort of students to receive Erasmus.

Edinburgh and Glasgow were two of the top three universities to send the most students on the scheme.

A year after I came back to Scotland, I moved to Nice in France to work as an intern for three months.

But this time I received funding from the replacement Turing scheme - which is similar to Erasmus but has a wider reach.

Now several years after it was scrapped, students will have more opportunities to study abroad as the UK is set to rejoin the Erasmus student exchange programme from 2027.

The Erasmus scheme allows students to study, train or volunteer in other European countries for up to a year, without paying any extra fees.

It is also open to those in vocational training, apprentices or people who are retraining through a college or school.

The scheme can cover travel, living and visa costs and course fees, with additional funding available for people with disabilities, additional learning needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Students pay fees to their home institutions, with additional costs covered by the European Union, funded by taxpayers' money.

The Turing scheme acts as a current replacement for Erasmus.

It has a more global reach than Erasmus, sending students to countries outside of Europe, including Canada, Japan and the US.

It funded nearly 3,000 placements in Scotland in 2024-25, according to data from the UK government.

The Turing scheme targets all students but focuses on the most disadvantaged.

The money I received from both the Erasmus and Turing schemes meant most of my expenses were covered and I was able to travel around Germany and France in my free time. 

In Germany, I attended local cultural festivals, explored beautiful towns and villages I would never know existed if I had not lived nearby. 

I also spent time with colleagues, even helping one of them with the animals in her outhouses.

The accommodation and living costs in France were higher than in Germany which meant I had less freedom.

But I still had the chance to go on boat trips, try local cuisine and go on hikes along the coastline. 

Each university has its own eligibility requirements and funding can be limited.

I received funding from both Erasmus and Turing as I studied French and German, and it was compulsory for me to complete three terms abroad.

For Erasmus, the money was split into two payments. 

I received 80% of the grant at the start of the placement to help with initial costs, such as accommodation deposits, travel from the UK and visa documents. 

The remainder was paid once the placement was complete. 

To receive both Erasmus and Turing, I had to set and meet targets, outline responsibilities and provide feedback from my supervisor to show I was making progress and my language skills were improving. 

Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency shows between 2013 and 2023, a total of 2,667 staff and 18,124 students from Scottish institutions took part in the Erasmus scheme.

All 27 EU member states are part of the programme, along with six non-members: Iceland, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey.

Spain, France and Germany were the most popular Erasmus destinations for British students and trainees.

The scheme also allows students at European universities to study at a university in the UK.

Almost 1.5 million people and 85,600 organisations took part in the Erasmus scheme in 2024.

The government confirmed the UK will contribute approximately £570m to the scheme to cover the 2027-28 academic year.

It said it had secured a 30% discount on what it would have paid under its current trade agreement with the EU, which encompasses many other industries.

The EU Relations Minister said it was a "huge win" for young people and will ensure everyone has the opportunity to study and train abroad. 

"This is about more than just travel," said Nick Thomas-Symonds. 

"It's about future skills, academic success, and giving the next generation access to the best possible opportunities."

Royal Society of Edinburgh's president and former principal of Glasgow University Sir Anton Muscatelli said he welcomed the UK government's decision.

"Anyone who has ever studied abroad will attest that the connections and collaborations fostered through international study reap benefits for many years," he said.

"Erasmus also opens up Scotland to students for all over Europe to come to here and experience the world-class higher education and excellence in research that our nation has to offer."

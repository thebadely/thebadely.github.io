Let's dive into the details: Serial killer Steve Wright has pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murdering a 17-year-old girl more than 25 years ago in Suffolk.

Victoria Hall's naked body was found five days after she had enjoyed a night out in Felixstowe in September 1999.

Wright, who is already serving a whole life jail sentence for murdering five women in and around Ipswich in 2006, appeared at the Old Bailey where a trial was initially due to take place.

However, the 67-year-old changed his pleas to all the charges and also admitted the attempted kidnap of a 22-year-old woman the night before Victoria disappeared. He is due to be sentenced on Friday.

Suffolk Police said Victoria's family had "waited over 26 years for this day" and it was "so very pleased that we have been able to deliver justice".

Wright was initially given a whole life sentence in 2008 for killing five women who were sex workers around Ipswich. They were Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls.

He never admitted to their murders but was found guilty by a jury following a trial at Ipswich Crown Court.

During this most recent hearing at the Old Bailey in London, Wright was due to stand trial after previously denying the latest charges. However, before the jury was sworn in, he changed his pleas.

He stood in the dock wearing glasses and a two-toned grey jumper and as he made his admissions, gasps and some sighs were heard in the court room. It was the first time he had ever publicly admitted to being a killer.

Back in 1999, Wright's victim Victoria lived in Trimley St Mary and was studying for her A-levels, having been a pupil at Orwell High School.

On 18 September that year, she went on a night out in Felixstowe with her friend.

They left the Bandbox nightclub at about 01:00 BST and walked the two miles back to Trimley.

The girls said goodbye at about 02:30, but Victoria was reported missing the next day.

Her body was found five days later in a ditch, 25 miles (40km) away in Creeting St Peter.

A businessman from Felixstowe was initially tried for her murder in 2001, but he was later found not guilty by a jury at Norwich Crown Court.

Suffolk Police reopened its investigation in 2019, on the 20th anniversary of Victoria's disappearance, before Wright was later charged with murdering her and attempting to kidnap Emily Doherty in Felixstowe the day before.

Samantha Woolley, a specialist prosecutor who led the Crown Prosecution Service case against Wright, said after Monday's hearing that justice "has finally been achieved".

"The meticulous work we have carried out with Suffolk Police, supporting their restarted investigation over the past six years and working hard to build this case to court, has resulted in Wright admitting his guilt," she said.

"This outcome should make plain that time does not preclude a successful prosecution; we will doggedly pursue justice for the victims of non-recent crimes, no matter how many decades have passed."

Assistant Chief Constable Alice Scott, of Suffolk Police, added: "Victoria's family have waited over 26 years for this day and I am so very pleased that we have been able to deliver justice for Victoria and they now know who is responsible for Victoria's murder.

"I am relieved that the family have been spared the ordeal of a trial, however, I am acutely aware that despite today's conviction, they will continue to live with the trauma of having Victoria ripped away from them at such a young age and in such horrific circumstances."

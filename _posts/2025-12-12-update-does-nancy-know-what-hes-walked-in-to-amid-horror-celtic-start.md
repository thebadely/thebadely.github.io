Nancy defiant after Roma defeat

"I don't think he quite knows what he's walked into."

Joe Hart likely did not mean it to sound like a criticism of Wilfried Nancy, but it wasn't difficult to derive a note of concern in the former Celtic goalkeeper's voice.

Nancy - just eight days into his reign as manager - had suffered a second defeat in his second game in charge, a meek 3-0 Europa League capitulation at the hands of Roma. That followed a home defeat against league leaders Hearts on Sunday.

No Celtic boss had ever lost his opening two matches. Not until now.

Frenchman Nancy - parachuted in from Columbus Crew in MLS without any managerial experience in Europe - was calm in the aftermath.

He spoke about how he saw "good things" in the second half against a Roma side who did not need to be anywhere near their best.

But that alarmed Hart, just as it will have the Celtic supporters. The consequences of a third defeat in a row, in Sunday's League Cup final against St Mirren, does not bear thinking about.

"It's not his fault that he doesn't understand," Hart, who left Celtic in summer 2024 after three seasons at the club, said on TNT Sports. "I didn't walk in and just understand what it was to be Celtic. They expect you to win. 

"Wilfried Nancy needs the people who appointed him to be in his ear. Not just telling him about tactics, but telling him how important Sunday is."

Latest Celtic news, views & analysis

As the players walked out at a packed Celtic Park, and a stirring rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone echoed around the stadium, the camera cut to Nancy. 

The disco lights, which were splurged out on for these European nights, flashed towards the Frenchman. 

Hart said the ground in the east end of Glasgow is a "special place" on such occasions but the mood of that place has turned sour in recent times. 

Long before Nancy's arrival, the club was riven with disharmony. 

The events of last summer - recruitment issues, Champions League dismay, Brendan Rodgers' acrimonious departure - had cast a long shadow.

Martin O'Neill's interim stint back at the club steadied matters, with seven wins from eight games and an uplift in the mood. 

But by the time Roma had a fourth goal ruled out in the closing stages on Thursday, large swathes of the crowd had gone home. Many fans had seen enough.

"It breaks my heart to see [Celtic Park] like this," said Hart. "The atmosphere just isn't there. This is such a special football club, but it's only special when it's united.

"It's not easy for a new manager and new system, but it's not rocket science and Nancy's got to learn quick."

Perhaps one thing all of a green and white persuasion could agree upon was that Roma were rampant as they cantered to a second win in Glasgow this term.

"It wasn't good enough, especially first half, we lost too many duels and too many sloppy balls," midfielder Arne Engels - who missed a first-half penalty - said. 

"We know we can do better and hopefully we can move on because we have a final in a few days. We need to keep our heads high and move on.

"It's up to us to react. We need to look to ourselves to keep performing."

Engels speaking after Europa League defeat to Roma

While the players who performed admirably for O'Neill look at themselves in a mirror, Nancy might need to retrieve his discarded tactics board.

He switched to an unfamilar back three for the defeat against Hearts and named an unchanged team to face Roma, and was rewarded with a horror first-half showing.

Celtic conceded three calamitous goals before Nancy could get them in at half time to regroup - making three significant changes with Kieran Tierney, Benjamin Nygren and Daizen Maeda all withdrawn.

Despite that, he maintains he still saw "good things".

"The reality is we were not able to cope with the intensity," Nancy told TNT Sports. "The first half was difficult, we were not able to come out of the pressure, but the second half was better. 

"I cannot tell you [the players] didn't try - they tried. 

"I'm not concerned, I really liked the reaction. They deserve at least to score one goal and the dynamic could change.

"The result isn't what we want but I've seen good things. This is a bit difficult because my players deserve a bit more, the belief of my players is really strong."

Nancy might have liked the reaction, but the pundits inside Parkhead were not as impressed. 

Former Scotland international James McFadden said "it was a cruise for Roma in the end", while ex-Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said "the only thing Celtic can do now is try to save face" in the dying embers of the game. 

But former Celtic centre-back and assistant manager Johan Mjallby arguably summed it up best.

"It's all about winning and he needs to understand that. If Celtic don't win on Sunday... Uh oh."

Hugh: Key sentence in Nancy interview - "I'm not concerned" Really?! The fans are.

Dougie: The arrogance of Nancy is unbelievable. You can't impose a complete change of formation mid-season. O'Neill's good work totally undone in two games. St Mirren will be confident ahead of Sunday.

Eddie: Who in their right mind thought it'd be wise to bring in a new manager for a top-of-the-table clash, European tie and a cup final all in eight days? All losable and if it turns out to be, then the new manager will not be accepted. This football club has broken itself from within.

Norman: Every Celtic fan knew it was not wise to bring in a new manager with no Scottish experience, who played a different formation, with no time to work with the squad before such an important week.

Matt: I don't think Nancy can be judged after a dodgy, arguably unlucky fixture against Hearts and a defeat to Roma, managed by a European trophy winner and fourth in Serie A. These are not indicative of whatever is to come.

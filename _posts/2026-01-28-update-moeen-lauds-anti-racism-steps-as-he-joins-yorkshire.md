It has been recently reported that Moeen Ali spent the past three seasons playing for Birmingham Bears in the T20 Blast

Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali has cancelled retirement plans and joined Yorkshire in a move he hopes can help the team continue to "build bridges" with communities.

The 38-year-old has reversed his decision to quit the county game, committing to playing in the T20 Blast.

Five years ago, Moeen spoke out in support of Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq who experienced racism while at the club.

Moeen says the case provided "a wake-up call for everybody" and expressed his belief that the county side have since "done a fantastic job integrating with society".

"There was no doubt in my mind [to join Yorkshire]. There has definitely been a change throughout all of the counties, all the way through from coaches to umpires," he said.

Over the past five years, Yorkshire have put in place a number of changes, from leadership to increasing support for women, girls and junior pathways.

Moeen, a two-time World Cup winner, joins the White Rose as one of England's most accomplished white-ball cricketers, scoring 7,792 runs and taking 271 wickets in 420 T20 matches.

Yorkshire's general manager of cricket Gavin Hamilton said: "Moeen's decision to join Yorkshire reflects the direction of travel at the club and the environment we are building. We're excited about what he will bring, not just in performances, but in setting standards."

Brook, 'Boozeball' and another Ashes hangover

Moeen announced he would be leaving domestic cricket behind after featuring for Birmingham Bears last summer.

He ended his international career the previous year after playing 68 Tests, 138 ODIs and 92 T20 internationals, and featuring in three Ashes series.

Following England's recent 4-1 Ashes defeat in Australia, the team's culture again made headlines, with the England and Wales Cricket Board pledging to investigate reports of players drinking excessively.

A devout Muslim, Moeen does not drink alcohol. From a sporting perspective, he says drinking a day or two before a match will have an impact on a player's performance.

"I think when you're at the elite level things have to be proper and if you're trying to perform at the highest level then drinking is a bigger issue," Moeen said.

"I think there should be something in placeâ¦ I know it happens in football, guys hardly drink before the game, I think it will be the same in cricket within four or five years."

Moeen, who won two IPL titles with Chennai Super Kings and captained Worcestershire to their first Blast triumph in 2018, also skippered Birmingham Phoenix to the final of the inaugural Hundred tournament.

He knows his latest move might surprise some people.

"There might be some fans disappointed at signing a 38-year-old, but I'm there to do a job and hopefully win silverware," he said.

"And to play at Headingley, which is such an iconic ground, is one of the main reasons I signed for Yorkshire. I know this might be the last two or three years of my career and I want to win as much as I can."

The move will also see Moeen team up with England's white-ball captain Harry Brook, the Yorkshire batsman who has been making headlines on and off the pitch.

Brook was punched by a nightclub bouncer in an altercation during England's tour of New Zealand before the Ashes. The incident and a fine imposed on Brook only came to light more than two months after the event.

More positively, Brook hit a rapid century for England on Tuesday in their victory over Sri Lanka in Colombo to secure a 2-1 ODI series win.

"I think he has done a good job. On and off the field is something everybody goes through, the greatest players have been through it, it's how you learn and how you come back from it," Moeen said.

"Mistakes can happen, it was just highlighted a lot more because we lost the Ashes. I think he will be fine, and I think he'll learn a lot."

Moeen will join his new side in May before their first T20 match against Nottinghamshire, and there is an option to extend his contract for 2027.

Yorkshire, who have never won the T20 Blast, have also signed Afghanistan's Naveen Ul-Haq and Australian fast bowler AJ Tye and Netherlands all-rounder Logan van Beek for the forthcoming campaign.

Moeen said of his future: "I have got one eye on what I want to do after cricket. I want to go straight into coaching.

"While I'm at Yorkshire I want to help as much as I can and if that means doing an academy session I'll be more than happy to help and pass on my knowledge of the game."

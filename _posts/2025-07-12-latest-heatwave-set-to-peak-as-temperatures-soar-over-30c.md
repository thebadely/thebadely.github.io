Experts revealed that The UK's third heatwave of the year is expected to peak on Saturday with temperatures soaring above 30C in large parts of the country.

The hottest temperatures are expected in the Midlands and south Wales, while Scotland and Northern Ireland could see their warmest days of the year so far - with highs of 31C and 29.5C each.

Friday saw the mercury hit a high of 34.7C in Astwood Bank in the West Midlands, and Wales recorded its hottest day of the year as Cardiff's Bute Park hit 32.4C.

Amber heat health alerts remain in place for parts of England, while Scotland and Northern Ireland face wildfire warnings for Saturday and Sunday.

Temperatures are expected to be widely in the high 20s to low 30s in England and Wales on Saturday. 

Eastern parts of England will see slightly cooler temperatures thanks to an easterly breeze - but most areas will still meet heatwave thresholds.

Sunday will see a slight dip to highs of 29C but the heat will remain - with a chance of some places around London seeing 30C or above. 

The amber heat health alerts cover southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia and will remain in place until Monday, the UK Health Security Agency has said.

Meanwhile, less severe yellow warnings remain in place for northern England on Saturday - meaning the warm weather could affect those who are particularly vulnerable, such as the elderly and those with existing health conditions.

Wimbledon's Centre Court reached a sweltering 32C on Friday, where similar temperatures are expected in south-west London as the final rounds kick off on Saturday.

This year, Wimbledon has faced some of the hottest temperatures in its 148-year history and has a heat rule in place for all singles matches.

The men's singles semi-final on Friday between Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz was stopped twice in less than five minutes due to fans in the crowd requiring medical attention.

Tournament organisers have added more free water refill points on the grounds and increased reminders for fans to take sun precautions and seek shade.

Fire chiefs have also warned people of the increased risk of drowning when trying to keep cool, urging parents to supervise their children at all times around the water.

Dry and hot conditions also make wildfires a crucial concern, with the risk currently rated at "severe" in London by the Natural Hazards Partnership.

"Our experience tells us that wildfires can start in an instant and escalate rapidly. That's why we're asking everyone to stay alert and act responsibly," the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) chairman Phil Garrigan said.

National Rail has warned commuters of possible disruption to travel this weekend as overhead power lines and rails could be affected by the heat.  

On Friday, more than seven million people across England and Wales were affected by hosepipe bans, restricting activities including watering of gardens, cleaning cars and filling paddling pools.

The heatwave will be over for most on Monday as cooler Atlantic air spreads, bringing cloud and some showers to northern and western areas.

Scientists warn that extreme weather conditions are made more likely as a result of manmade climate change.

Experts revealed that A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape following the death of a 13-year-old girl in Huddersfield.

Police were called by the ambulance service to a flat on Sheepridge Road just after 23:30 BST on Monday to reports the girl was unresponsive. She was taken to hospital where she died in the early hours of Tuesday.

The arrested boy, from Huddersfield, remains in custody, West Yorkshire Police said.

He was also arrested on suspicion of rape relating to a 16-year-old girl from a separate incident elsewhere in Kirklees.

A post-mortem examination carried out on Wednesday found the girl's death was unexplained pending further investigation.

Det Ch Insp Stacey Atkinson of the Homicide and Major Inquiry Team said: "A post mortem was not able to determine how she died, and we continue to treat her death as unexplained at this time, pending more inquiries.

"Those inquiries are complex and are likely to be lengthy as we work to fully understand the circumstances of the girl's death.

"Specially trained officers are supporting her family at this time."

Experts revealed that Wyndham Clark won the US Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023

The United States Golf Association has refused to comment on reports that Wyndham Clark has been banned by Oakmont Country Club after a century-old locker he was using was damaged during this year's US Open.

The American, 31, won the US Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023 but missed the cut at this year's event. 

Photos then emerged of damage reportedly caused by Clark at the course in Pittsburgh. 

Golf Digest says it has obtained a letter sent by Oakmont to its members in which it wrote: "Following multiple discussions with the USGA and the OCC board, a decision has been made that Mr Clark will no longer be permitted on OCC property.

"Reinstatement would be contingent upon Mr Clark fulfilling a number of specific conditions, including full repayment for damages, a meaningful contribution to a charity of the board's choosing, and the successful completion of counselling and/or anger management sessions."

The USGA told BBC Sport it is not commenting on the matter.

At last week's Scottish Open, Clark, ranked 28th in the world, said: "I made a mistake in a moment of rage with, you know, a bad year and everything coming together.

"And it was more than anything a good wake-up call for me to say, 'Hey, you know what, let's get back on track and things aren't that bad'."

The 2023 US Ryder Cup player had apologised the week after the incident in June, saying: "I'm very sorry for what happened. 

"But I'd also like to move on, not only for myself but for Oakmont, for the USGA and kind of focus on the rest of this year and things that come up."

The US Open will next be staged at Oakmont in 2033, at which point Clark would still have an exemption in to the field through his 2023 victory.

Clark will be in action at the Open Championship at Royal Portrush this week, teeing off at 10:20 BST on Thursday alongside Tom Hoge and Corey Connors.

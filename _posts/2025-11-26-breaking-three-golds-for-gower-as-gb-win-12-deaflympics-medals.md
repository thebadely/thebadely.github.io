Experts revealed that Gower won three gold medals, three silvers and one bronze at the Deaflympics

Charlotte Gower won triple gold as Great Britain secured 12 medals at the Deaflympics in Tokyo.

Gower, 15, triumphed in the 200m individual medley and the 100m and 200m backstroke events as part of a seven-medal haul in the Japanese capital, which also included silver in the women's 4x100m medley relay.

British team-mate Katy Wun also won multiple medals in the pool, including golds in the 800m and 1500m freestyle races.

Away from the water, GB's women's football team won bronze with a 2-0 victory over Australia.

The Deaflympics is an international multi-sports event for deaf athletes that takes place every four years.

Great Britain did not send a delegation to compete at the last edition of the Deaflympics in 2022 after it was rearranged because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The 2025 team had been asked to raise Â£4,000 each to fund the Â£500,000 cost of sending 100 athletes and support staff to Tokyo.

Unlike for Olympic and Paralympic sport, the government does not directly fund athletes competing at the Deaflympics via UK Sport.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said Sport England was currently providing Â£1.27m in funding for UK Deaf Sport through to 2027.

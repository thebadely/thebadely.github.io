According to new developments, Traore joined Fulham on a free transfer after leaving Wolves in August 2023

West Ham are set to sign Fulham winger Adama Traore on a permanent deal, with the move subject to a medical.

The 30âyearâold is close to a reported Â£2m switch from west to east London, where he will be reunited with Nuno Espirito Santo, who managed him at Wolves.

Capped eight times by Spain, Traore has made just two Premier League starts for Fulham this season and was not involved in their most recent 2â1 win at home to Brighton on Saturday.

Having started his career at Barcelona, Traore had spells at Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Wolves before joining Fulham in 2023 on a free transfer.

West Ham have been among the most active teams in the January transfer window, signing forwards Pablo Felipe from Gil Vicente for Â£20m and Taty Castellanos from Lazio for Â£25.2m.

They are also in talks to sell midfielder Lucas Paqueta to Flamengo, having already sold Guido Rodriguez to Valencia and Luis Guilherme to Sporting, while German Niclas Fullkrug has joined AC Milan on loan.

The Hammers' busy winter window comes with the club still in the relegation zone on 20 points, five off safety despite winning their last two league matches, with 15 fixtures left to play.

Best shots as Raducanu beats Vondrousova to set up Sabalenka match

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Three British players bid for a place in the Wimbledon fourth round on Friday - but Emma Raducanu will have to see off the world number one to get there.

British number one Raducanu will take on Aryna Sabalenka - a finalist at the past three Grand Slams - in the final match on Centre Court.

Raducanu has beaten three top-10 players in her career, including then world number nine Maria Sakkari at the same stage of Wimbledon last year.

Cameron Norrie and Sonay Kartal also continue their campaigns, as does two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Raducanu faces Sabalenka in the third match on Centre Court, where American fifth seed Taylor Fritz opens play against Spanish 26th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Fritz has been taken to five sets in both of his Wimbledon matches so far.

That is followed by Spanish second seed Alcaraz, who faces Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.

Kartal takes on France's Diane Parry in the first match on Court One at 13:00 BST as she bids to reach the fourth round of a major for the first time.

She is followed by Norrie, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2022, who faces Italy's Mattia Bellucci.

Ukraine's Elina Svitolina then continues her bid for an elusive first Grand Slam title when she takes on Elise Mertens of Belgium in the final match.

The men's and women's doubles competitions continue on Friday, which also marks the first day of the mixed doubles at this year's Wimbledon.

There is plenty of British interest, including Neal Skupski, who teams up again with American Desirae Krawczyk following their triumphs in 2021 and 2022. They take on Sadio Doumbia and Wu Fang-hsien fourth on court 14.

Heather Watson, who won alongside Henri Kontinen in 2016, plays with fellow Briton Julian Cash, while 39-year-old Jamie Murray will be partnered by Emily Appleton in another all-British partnership.

In the second round of the men's doubles, British duo Billy Harris and Marcus Willis take on their compatriot Henry Patten and Finland's Harri Heliovaara - the second seeds - in the first match on court 17 (12:30).

Four-time major winner Naomi Osaka has gone under the radar at Wimbledon so far.

The Japanese player has had a tricky season so far but, having gone through her first two matches without dropping a set, she is on the brink of reaching the fourth round for the first time. She takes on Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first match on court two from 11:00.

That is followed by sixth seed and Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who some have picked to challenge for the title, against Laura Siegemund of Germany.

Brazil's rising teenage star Joao Fonseca, who only won his first ATP Tour grass-court match in the week before Wimbledon, closes play on that court against Chile's Nicolas Jarry.

Queen's runner-up Amanda Anisimova is first on court three against Hungarian Dalma Galfi, followed by Russian 14th seed Andrey Rublev against French veteran Adrian Mannarino.

'Too many teams enjoy playing here' - McInnes

Derek McInnes aims to "deliver silverware" after being confirmed as the new head coach of Hearts on a four-year deal.

The 53-year-old leaves Scottish Premiership rivals Kilmarnock and succeeds Neil Critchley, who was sacked in late April after six months in charge.

Coaches Paul Sheerin and Alan Archibald will follow McInnes from Rugby Park to Tynecastle.

"The opportunity to manage Hearts was just everything I wanted," said a "delighted" McInnes.

"I've always felt that this is a club that I've wanted to manage. The intention is to try and deliver silverware, bring sustained success on the pitch and just be the biggest animal we can be and try and meet the expectation that's there from everybody."

The new head coach indicated he would quickly address the situation with captain Lawrence Shankland, who has scored 67 goals in three years at Hearts, and goalkeeper Craig Gordon, both of whom are out of contract this summer, saying "these conversations will be had".

The club have been working with Jamestown Analytics for their recruitment and McInnes believes the relationship can give Hearts an "added advantage".

"I feel as though we've got so much going for us here at Tynecastle and at Hearts," he said. "There's a real excitement about being the guy to take it on.

"Lawrence, I know him more than Craig but both are capable players, have proven they're good players here. I just want to work with good players.

"Clearly, there's work needing done. There's a lot of good players here and we need to find a better way of working.

"Hopefully, when the window closes, the squad will be more rounded, maybe a bit more balanced and a bit more what I would want it to be for the challenges ahead."

McInnes had been in charge at Kilmarnock since 2022 and last season guided the Ayrshire side into Europe by finishing fourth.

His managerial career began when he took St Johnstone into the top flight in 2009 and, after a brief stint at Bristol City, he had eight years in Aberdeen, with whom he never finished lower than fourth and won the League Cup in 2014.

McInnes left Pittodrie in 2021 and took charge of Kilmarnock the following January, leading them to promotion to the Premiership.

His spell in Ayrshire ended with his side finishing in ninth, two places below Hearts.

Kilmarnock lost 1-0 to Hearts at Rugby Park on Sunday, with McInnes absent from the home dugout after a compensation deal was agreed between the clubs.

He said being linked with Hearts in the closing weeks of the season had been "a bit problematic" but insisted he had "nothing to apologise for".

"I loved my time at Kilmarnock," he explained. "Ideally, it would've been done at the end of the season.

"It's never easy, these things. For me, it's all about the new start at Hearts. For me and my family, this is what I wanted. In football, things change pretty quickly."

Sporting director Graeme Jones said of McInnes: "He was the standout candidate from the process we went through. It's really satisfying to get to today and have Derek sitting alongside me."

After a disappointing 2024-25 campaign, what should McInnes' priorities be to get Hearts challenging at the right end of the table next term?

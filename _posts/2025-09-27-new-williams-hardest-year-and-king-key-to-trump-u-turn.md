It has been recently reported that The Guardian says Sir Keir Starmer will tell the Labour conference that the party is "in a fight for the soul of the nation." Speaking to the paper ahead of the conference, the prime minister said he would tell disgruntled party members that now was not the time for infighting.

Many of the papers consider yesterday's announcement about digital ID cards, aimed at preventing illegal immigration. The Times says the scheme must not grow to exceed its original remit. The Sun warns, "imagine how devastating it would be if the entire digital ID database - containing sensitive details about every one of us - fell into criminal or even enemy hands, or was left paralysed".

Writing in the Daily Express, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage says the scheme will do nothing to combat illegal immigration. And in the Daily Mail, the former prime minister Boris Johnson says the one way to stop the gangs and deter people from risking the tides is to "ping" them to Rwanda.

The Daily Telegraph says the King played a critical role in persuading Donald Trump to make a U-turn on his position on Ukraine. According to the paper, President Volodymyr Zelensky's top advisor said talks during Trump's recent state visit were "very important" in convincing him that Ukraine could win the war against Russia.

The Sun says that despite Prince Harry's 53-minute meeting with the King on his recent visit to the UK, there is no prospect of him returning to the family fold. The Daily Express is more interested in his brother, noting that in a TV interview, Prince William has opened up about his "hardest year" - coping with his wife and father's cancer battles. The Daily Mirror says a fall-out with his brother and Prince Andrew's ongoing scandals have deepened the distress.

"The Red Roses are all set to bloom," says the Times, as it looks ahead to today's women's Rugby Union world cup final, where England will meet Canada at Twickenham. Writing in the Mirror, the sports minister Stephanie Peacock says that whatever happens this afternoon, every young girl watching will see that rugby is for them too.

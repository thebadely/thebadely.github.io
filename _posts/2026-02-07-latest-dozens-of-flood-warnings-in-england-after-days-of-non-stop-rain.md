According to new developments, Dozens of flood warnings and alerts have been issued across England following days of rain.

There were 85 warnings and 234 alerts in England as of Saturday evening. Most of the warnings are located in the south-west and the Midlands. There is currently one flood warning in Scotland and none in Wales.

The Met Office said on Thursday that rain had fallen every day of 2026 in south-west England and South Wales, with both areas seeing 50% more rainfall than usual.

The UK was hit by a succession of three named storms in January, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and disruption.

On Saturday, an Asda van was submerged in flood water at Walfords Bridge in Shropshire. No one was trapped.

Flood warnings are clustered in Devon and Hampshire, as well as between Gloucester and Worcester. However, more than 230 flood alerts are scattered across much of England apart from the far north and East Anglia.

Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service warned that flooding was "imminent" after "heavy prolonged rainfall" had caused local levels at the River Dene to rise.

Rain is expected to continue falling throughout the weekend and into the start of the new week.

Northern Ireland had its wettest January in 149 years, while County Down and Cornwall had the wettest January on record, according to the Met Office.

February has also seen similarly intense rainfall.

Provisional Met Office data shows some parts of the UK recorded more rainfall in the first five days of the month than it would normally expect over the course of the whole month.

Aberdeenshire has been one of the wettest places of all, with Aboyne receiving over 130% of its normal February rainfall in just five days.

Last week, Storm Chandra brought flooding and travel disruption, and saw dozens of schools close.

It was the third named storm to batter the UK so far this year, after Ingrid and Goretti.

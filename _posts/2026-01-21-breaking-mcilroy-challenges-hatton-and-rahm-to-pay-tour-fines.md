Experts revealed that Rory McIlroy is this week playing at the Hero Dubai Desert Classic, part of the DP World Tour

Rory McIlroy has challenged Tyrrell Hatton and Jon Rahm to "prove" their commitment to Europe's Ryder Cup team by settling their multi-million pound fines from the DP World Tour.

England's Hatton and Spaniard Rahm were fined for competing in conflicting LIV Golf events while remaining members of the European-based tour.

Both appealed against the sanctions in 2024, which allowed them to play in enough events to retain their membership and be eligible for last year's Ryder Cup victory over the United States in New York.

The cases are yet to be heard so the question over their eligibility is set to return before the 2027 Ryder Cup at Adare Manor in Ireland.

Asked at the Hero Dubai Desert Classic whether it would be easier if Hatton and Rahm paid their fines, world number two McIlroy told reporters: "Absolutely, yeah.

"We went really hard on the Americans about being paid to play the Ryder Cup and we also said that we would pay to play in Ryder Cups. There are two guys that can prove it."

American players each received $500,000 (Â£373,000) from organisers the PGA of America to compete in last year's defeat at Bethpage, making it the first time in the Ryder Cup's 98-year history that players on either side had been paid to play.

However, some of the players said during the event in New York that they would donate their earnings to charity.

While several of the world's top golfers were lured to LIV, Northern Ireland's McIlroy remained loyal to the DP World Tour and US-based PGA Tour.

"I think any organisation or any members' organisation like this has a right to uphold its rules and regulations," added the reigning Masters champion.

"What the DP World Tour is doing is upholding its rules and regulations. We, as members, sign a document at the start of every year, which has you agree to these rules and regulations.

"The people that made the option to go to LIV knew what they were. So I don't see what's wrong with that."

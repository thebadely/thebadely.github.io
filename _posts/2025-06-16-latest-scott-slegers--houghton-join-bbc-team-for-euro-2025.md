Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gabby Logan, Alex Scott and Jeanette Kwakye will lead the BBC's coverage of the Women's Euro 2025 in Switzerland on TV and iPlayer.

England's all-time record goal scorer Ellen White, along with former Lionesses players Jill Scott, Steph Houghton and Fara Williams have been named on the BBC's pundit team as the Lionesses prepare to defend their title.

They're joined by Anita Asante and Ellie Roebuck, along with former Wales international Katie Sherwood. 

Arsenal boss Renee Slegers, Scotland's Rachel Corsie, ex-England defender Nedum Onuoha and former Germany international Josie Henning will also provide tournament analysis.

"Few things bring excitement and nerves like a big football tournament and Uefa Women's Euro 2025 will be no different," said Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport.

"Whether you're sitting in front of the TV, listening on the radio, following our live pages, social channels or website and app coverage, the BBC will be bringing the drama to life."

Euro 2025 gets under way on 2 July as 16 teams compete for glory in Switzerland.

Kay-Jelski added: "The Uefa Women's Euro 2025 is part of a top-tier line-up of women's sports on the BBC this summer. 

"We are celebrating the names being made and telling the homegrown stories that matter to audiences. Will we see another iconic moment like Russo's backheel? You'll have to stay tuned and follow all the action with us."

Football Association of Wales chief executive Noel Mooney says the Wales men's senior side will play "a couple" of games at Cardiff's Principality Stadium in the build-up to Euro 2028.

Wales will co-host the Euros in three years' time alongside England, the Republic of Ireland and Scotland with the Principality Stadium set to stage six games.

Mooney said it would be a great experience to play at the home of Welsh rugby again, but insisted Cardiff City Stadium remains the national football team's "spiritual home".

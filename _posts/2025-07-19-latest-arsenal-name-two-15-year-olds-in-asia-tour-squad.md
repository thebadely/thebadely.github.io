Here’s what you need to know: Dowman is rated as one of Arsenal's brightest talents

Arsenal have included 15-year-olds Max Dowman and Marli Salmon in their squad for their tour of Singapore and Hong Kong.

Attacking midfielder Dowman and centre-back Salmon will join new recruits Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Christian Norgaard as part of the 30-man  travelling party.

However, Â£48.5m signing Noni Madueke will not be involved as he rests after his exploits with Chelsea in the Club World Cup. 

The 23-year-old will join up with the squad when they return from Asia.

The Gunners will play two games in Singapore - AC Milan on 23 July and Newcastle on 27 July - before flying to Hong Kong for a north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur on 31 July. 

Dowman, who does not turn 16 until December, has been training with the senior squad for some time and travelled with the team to their winter training camp in January.

Due to Premier League rules, Dowman could not make his debut last season as he was named in the Arsenal Under-15 squad.

He has been given the number 56 for the tour with manager Mikel Arteta calling him a "huge talent" and hinting that he could be part of his plans this season.

Dowman scored 19 goals and had five assists during 23 games in all competitions for Arsenal's youth teams last season.

He also became the youngest scorer in European Under-17 Championship history when he netted in England's win over the Czech Republic in May.

Let's dive into the details: Katie Uhlaender finished fourth in the 2014 Sochi Games

Canada's decision to withdraw athletes from the North American Cup at Lake Placid on Sunday - a move which USA slider Katie Uhlaender claims cost her a spot at next month's Winter Olympics - is being investigated by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation.

Uhlaender, 41, a double world champion in 2012, was hoping to pick up enough ranking points to qualify for a sixth Games before the 18 January deadline.

She won the development race but Canada's move to pull four athletes out reduced the field to less than 21, reducing the number of points available and ending Uhlaender's chances of competing at Milan-Cortina.

Uhlaender claims she was told of the plan by Canada coach Joe Cecchini on Friday and in quotes reported by DW said: , external"I cried when I found out he went through with this plan.

"I didn't know if it hurt more that my friend of 20 years just nailed my coffin, my Olympic dream is over. Or, that my best friend of 20 years is doing something so horrible that hurts so many people."

Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton (BCS) said the decision to withdraw the athletes was made "after careful evaluation of the program's needs and in consultation with the IBSF".

BCS added that it "remains confident that its actions were appropriate, transparent, and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport".

The BCS said decisions around competition participation are made with "careful consideration of athlete health, safety, and long-term development".

"It was determined that continuing to race these athletes was not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of the program," it added.

The national body acknowledged that the move had an "unintended impact on the size of the field and, consequently, the number of development points allocated for the event".

But it added: "It is well understood within the sport that development circuits do not carry fixed points. The National Skeleton Program has always treated the development circuit as exactly that - a developmental environment - not a pathway for Olympic qualification.

"The health, safety, and long-term development of our athletes remain our highest priority. Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton takes great pride in its commitment to fair, equitable competition while respecting International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) rules and standards."

The IBSF told BBC Sport: "We have requested the IBSF Integrity Unit to investigate in the incident."

A USA Bobsled/Skeleton spokesperson welcomed the IBSF review and said: "USA Bobsled/Skeleton is committed to fair play and to protecting the rights of athletes.

"At the same time, we recognise the importance of maintaining positive and respectful international relationships within our sport."

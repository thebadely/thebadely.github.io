Experts revealed that Do Travis Head (left), Ben Stokes (centre) and Mitchell Starc (right) make your XI?

Australia have retained the Ashes and lead England 3-1 heading into the fifth Test, but who makes your combined team of the series? 

Players from both sides have impressed so we want to know who you would put into an XI.

We've split the side into four categories: openers, middle order (including all-rounders), wicketkeeper and bowlers. We've given you all the stats, up to and including the day of publication (4 January), to help you make your decision.

The results will be revealed on the BBC Sport website, The Ashes Debrief and on the TMS podcast later in the Test.

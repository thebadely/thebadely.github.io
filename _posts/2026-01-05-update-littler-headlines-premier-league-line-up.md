According to new developments, Luke Littler is aiming to win his second Premier League title

World champion Luke Littler will headline this year's Premier League Darts line-up with Jonny Clayton, Stephen Bunting, Gerwyn Price and debutant Josh Rock confirmed as wildcards.

The 16-week competition will also feature defending champion Luke Humphries and Michael van Gerwen when it begins on 5 February in Newcastle.

Dutchman Gian van Veen, who Littler beat last week to secure his second world crown, will also make his debut in the competition.

The format sees each league night comprise quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final over the best of 11 legs, followed by a finale at London's O2 Arena on 28 May made up of the top four point scorers.

Humphries beat Littler 11-8 to win last year's tournament.

As the current top four players in the world rankings, Littler, Humphries, Van Veen and Van Gerwen were guaranteed places in the group stage of the invitational event.

The other four slots were then decided by the Professional Darts Corporation.

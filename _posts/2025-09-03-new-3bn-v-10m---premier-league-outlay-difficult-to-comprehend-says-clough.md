Premier League transfer spending has become incomprehensible and risks "pricing fans out" of watching the clubs they support, says former England striker Nigel Clough.

The 59-year-old counts record spenders Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Manchester City among his former clubs.

Those three top-flight sides spent a combined Â£772m during the summer, with Liverpool alone paying out Â£415m.

Across the Premier League, more than Â£3bn was spent during the latest transfer window.

By contrast, in England's third tier, where Clough manages Mansfield Town, the total outlay was about Â£10m.

"It's difficult to comprehend when you are talking about billions," Clough told BBC Radio Nottingham.

"We were talking about millions many, many years ago, then hundreds of millions and now it's in the billions.

"I don't know where everyone gets the money from. I know there are some very rich owners out there and there are TV deals, but I'm not sure where it will end or if it's healthy in the long run for football."

It was Clough's father, Brian, who was the first British manager to bring in a player for Â£1m, when, as Forest boss, he signed Trevor Francis for what was then the record fee in 1979.

That record has ballooned in the decades since, with Alexander Isak now the most expensive player in the history of the British game after joining Liverpool from Newcastle United for Â£125m on Monday.

Considering the Â£1m fee 46 years ago is the equivalent, external of Â£4.95m in 2025 terms, the Isak transfer comes out to be more than 25 times bigger.

When asked about the astronomical sums being paid for players in the Premier League - when, just two divisions below, Clough has not spent any money on transfers to strengthen his side this summer - the former Sheffield United, Derby County and Burton Albion boss expressed concern.

"I know one thing that's not coming down is prices for supporters to go and watch football," he said.

"That is going up too much as well and you have got to be careful that you don't price ordinary people out of going to watch football, certainly at the highest level.

"It's important at our level that we keep it realistic."

Premier League Â£3bn summer spending surpasses record

From 'not possible' to record spenders - Liverpool's transfer window

Can you name every record Premier League signing?

Mansfield's rise to League One, having not played in the third tier for more than two decades before their return to that level last season, has seen attendances at the One Call Stadium increase.

And while Clough and the Stags resisted paying fees for recruits in the latest transfer window, he insists there is no policy against spending.

It was only a year ago that they spent Â£200,000 - one of the biggest fees in the club's history - to bring in striker Will Evans.

"We have no problem with that [paying transfer fees]," Clough said.

"We paid a fee for Will Evans a year ago and it's been very good value with him.

"And we put plenty of bids in [this summer] but when people start talking silly money, we won't do that. We won't pay over the odds for somebody who we don't think is worth it. That is just the policy of the club."

Clough stands by that policy even when he freely admits that significant money spent in the division - namely by Birmingham City and Wrexham last season - paid off with promotion.

"Birmingham and Wrexham were out on their own last season," he added. "And with Charlton in there, the three biggest wage bills went up [won promotion]. That probably shows you something or how much it means.

"With those two out of the way, it's much more even in the league with spending. But even now, Huddersfield have spent big, and others have spent more than Â£1m on strikers.

"It's big money for League One, which seems to be the way that football is going at the moment."

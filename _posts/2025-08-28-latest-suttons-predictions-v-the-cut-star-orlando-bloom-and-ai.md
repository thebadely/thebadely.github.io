Let's dive into the details: The Premier League returns for another mouth-watering weekend of football with Liverpool v Arsenal on Sunday (16:30 BST) being the pick of the fixtures.

BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

He's been the prediction winner in each of the first two weekends of the season but stressed to BBC Sport this week: "I don't want readers and guests feeling like they've lost already, I don't want AI to become disillusioned.

"I've had an incredible start to the season and made it look easy but this could be the week where the wheels come off."

For week three, he takes on actor Orlando Bloom, who supports Manchester United.

Bloom's new film The Cut is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Bloom lost more than 30lb to play his role of the boxer in The Cut. The film was shot in reverse chronological order so he was at his lightest on the first day of filming, which shows his character on the last day of the movie

Bloom is from Kent but says he grew up as a United fan because of his neighbours.

"This Irish family we lived next door to, the McEvoys, were all big United fans so we watched all their games together," Bloom told BBC Sport.

"I miss it now I live in the United States. I still love watching games when I can but what I think I love most is the way football brings people together. 

"It's like a big music gig - I went to see Oasis in Manchester in July and a huge game is exactly the same, like worshipping at a church and I love that feeling."

In the film, Bloom plays a retired boxer who undergoes a gruelling training and weight-loss routine to return to the ring for one last shot at the title.

"The movie is really about the psychology of an athlete, which I find fascinating in every sport - that kind of 'leave it all on the field' mentality," he added.

"That's how I like to live a little bit myself - I thrive off a challenge, physical or mental... which is why I am taking Chris on at predictions."

Orlando Bloom was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Stamford Bridge, 12:30 BST

Chelsea looked lacklustre in their opener against Crystal Palace but then thrashed West Ham 5-1. The things is, how can you properly judge anybody who has played West Ham?

My gut feeling is Chelsea will have got a great deal of confidence from the manner in which they beat the Hammers last week. 

I like Fulham under Marco Silva and the way they play could cause Chelsea one or two problems.

But I still think the Blues will come out on top in this West London derby.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Orlando's prediction: Chelsea are the favourites for this. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Old Trafford, 15:00 BST

I haven't got a clue with this one, nothing would surprise me. I don't think there'll be a lot of goals in this game, but surely Manchester United need to bounce back with some kind of statement?

It's a bad week for United. They were played off the park by Grimsby in the first half and were ultimately humiliated. I know Ruben Amorim made eight changes but he threw the big guns on in the end and you don't know what sort of impact that loss will have across the club.

After Grimsby, I think Amorim is under huge pressure.

Burnley will be stubborn and resolute, and they do carry an attacking threat. Will Manchester United find a way? Something's telling me to pick United to win but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Burnley embarrassed them.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Orlando's prediction: This might be closer than people think. 1-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Stadium of Light, 15:00 BST

Sunderland had that brilliant start against West Ham and they had a tight game with Burnley. I thought it'd be a draw but Burnley ultimately got the win.

Brentford played very well at Aston Villa and deserved their win in what was a massive result for Keith Andrews. 

I've said before I know people have written Brentford off but they are an experienced, battle-hardened Premier League side. I think their win last week would've done them the world of good. They should win again on Saturday.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Orlando's prediction: No goals here. 0-0

AI's prediction: 2-2

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00 BST

This'll be a great game. Bournemouth were excellent against Wolves last weekend and were unlucky to only win 1-0. They've always got an attacking threat and because of that, I always fancy them to score.

But then Thomas Frank's Tottenham have been so well balanced. They've been phenomenal so far.

As for Richarlison, I was told by statman Dave not to get him in my Fantasy Team. I didn't put him in and he's had an amazing start - two goals and one assist.

At home, I fancy Tottenham to nick it.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Orlando's prediction: Tottenham to edge it. 2-1

AI's prediction: 3-1

Molineux, 15:00 BST

It's a big match for Wolves, this. Vitor Pereira needs a result.

I thought Pereira did a good job with them last season. They have lost Matheus Cunha, of course. But against Bournemouth they were a man down and against Manchester City they just fell to pieces and were smashed.

I do worry about Everton, especially in the centre-forward area. Maybe Thierno Barry will come to the fore but Â£27m doesn't get you a top-class striker these days and he's still got some developing to do.

That said, if there's a motivated Jack Grealish then Everton have a really good chance. He was excellent against Brighton. It's good to see him back playing football with a smile on his face.

Should be a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Orlando's prediction: Jack Grealish is a really exciting signing. 0-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

Elland Road, 17:30 BST

Newcastle were phenomenal against Liverpool. But my worry for them is this: Sandro Tonali and Joelinton both went off injured last match and those two in midfield are an absolute force. I don't know what taking them out will do to the team.

Leeds lost 5-0 to Arsenal. They were thumped. Well beaten. But are they going to be a different proposition at Elland Road? They played with such great intensity in their opening game against Everton. 

There should be an asterisk for this one, really. If Tonali and Joelinton are fit, which I don't think will be, then Newcastle should win. But this has put me in a really vulnerable position as the BBC predictions expert - I don't have all the data!

With Anthony Gordon also suspended, I'm going for a draw, purely based on the fact that Newcastle won't have any players.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Orlando's prediction: I can see Leeds getting something here. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Amex Stadium, 14:00 BST

Which Manchester City side will we see? I said last week on Football Focus and Final Score that the goalkeepeing situation with James Trafford worries the life out of me. I don't think he should be playing ahead of Ederson, even if there is talk of Ederson leaving.

Brighton should've won their first game against Fulham - they didn't and then they lost to Everton despite having a fair few chances.

This match could be anything. I think we'll find out a lot about Manchester City and whether they can be challengers because Brighton away is a difficult fixture. 

Last season I backed City on so many occasions saying they'd bounce back. I got so many of the predictions wrong after they did the exact opposite and stayed on their bad run.

There's a strong chance I'll be wrong again, wouldn't be the first time, but I'm going to revert back to last season's technique and say City will pinch this.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Orlando's prediction: Brighton beat City last season and they can cause them more problems this time. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-3

City Ground, 14:00 BST

It's been a good start to the season for Nottingham Forest despite all of their off-the-pitch turbulence. They got a draw last week coming from behind at Crystal Palace and were excellent against Brentford in their first game.

West Ham look flimsy and were knocked out of the League Cup in midweek. Graham Potter is under serious pressure. Potter needs to wave his magic wand!

I'm really worried about West Ham. I think the West Ham fans have had enough already and we're not even in September yet. After their cup loss Jarrod Bowen tried to confront some Hammers fans - that wasn't super, smashing or great from Bowen. He later apologised. 

Forest should win this one comfortably.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Orlando's prediction: Forest are strong at home. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Anfield, 16:30 BST

My worry with Liverpool is exactly what Arne Slot talked about in pre-season. They're too defensively vulnerable.

They've already conceded four goals. Ibrahima Konate looks shot to pieces and has been all over the place in the last two games. He's been a great player in the past for Liverpool but right now he looks like a triallist. 

If you're a Liverpool fan I guess the good thing is your side are still getting results.  But if you want to win league titles you've got to be watertight and strong at the back, and I'm not so sure Liverpool are.

Liverpool got bullied by Newcastle. There's no reason why Arsenal can't bully them too. I've just got a sneaky feeling that Arsenal, bolstered by new signing Eberechi Eze, will exploit them.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Orlando's prediction: There will be a few goals in this one. 3-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

Villa Park, 19:00 BST

I'm really worried about my old club Aston Villa, their performance against Brentford last weekend was so insipid and so flat. They haven't got going at all.

We know the way Villa play. It's very much possession orientated and they'll play out from the back. Crystal Palace will mix their game up but I've just got a feeling that Villa will finally turn up in this one.

Plus, I'm not sure how Eze's departure will impact Crystal Palace. They coped in a one-off game with Nottingham Forest last week but long-term they're going to suffer from that loss of creativity.

I think Palace are still a strong team, even without Eze, but I'm going third time lucky with Villa hoping they'll actually turn in a performance. If they don't, then fans will start getting really concerned.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Orlando's prediction: This is going to be close. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-0

Just like in the first week, Chris was the winner in week two after getting six correct results and three correct scores, giving him an impressive 150 points.

AI came second with five correct results and two exact scores giving them 110 points.

The BBC readers came third - you got five correct results and one exact score, giving you 80 points.

Guest Theo Ellis, from band Wolf Alice, finished fourth with five correct results and no exact scores for a final total of 50 points.

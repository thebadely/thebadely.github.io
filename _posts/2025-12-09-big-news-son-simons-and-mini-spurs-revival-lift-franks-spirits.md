Here’s what you need to know: Son Heung-min addressed Spurs fan before kick-off on his return to the club ahead of the Champions League game against Slavia Prague.

Son Heung-min, as he did so often in a magnificent Tottenham Hotspur career, arrived on the scene with perfect timing.

The great South Korean, who scored 173 goals in 454 games for Spurs, was back at the club for the first time since leaving for Los Angeles FC in the summer.

It was fitting that it was a big European night that marked the return of the talisman who played a key role when Spurs reached the Champions League Final in 2019 and made his farewell appearance as captain when they won their first trophy for 17 years by beating Manchester United in the Europa League Final in Bilbao last season.

An emotional Son addressed Spurs fans before kick-off, receiving a predictably rapturous reception, before watching Thomas Frank's team take another important step forward with a comfortable Champions League win against Slavia Prague.

It was almost as if Spurs were fated to deliver in the presence of one of their modern greats, who went to view a mural painted in his honour before kick-off having been unable to say goodbye when he left for the United States.

Son's presence added a feel-good factor in an environment that has endured its share of toxicity this season as Frank has struggled to convince Spurs fans of his suitability to tackle a more high-profile task than at previous club Brentford.

And there is no doubt this has been a vital week for Frank, whose short spell at Spurs hit a low after the recent defeat at home to Fulham, when he publicly criticised those who jeered keeper Guglielmo Vicario after a mistake led to a goal as "not true Tottenham fans."

This is a high-risk, high stakes strategy. Frank needed results to back up that sort of confrontational talk and in the last three games Spurs have delivered.

Spurs overcome Slavia Prague for vital Champions League victory

Xavi Simons continued his improvement by scoring from the spot in the victory against Slavia Prague in the Champions League.

Spurs came from behind twice to earn a point at Newcastle United, cruised past Frank's former club Brentford, then added this convincing 3-0 win against Slavia Prague to this mini-revival.

Before the victory against Brentford, Spurs had played 16 league games at home in 2025, winning only three and losing 10. This is the tide Frank has to turn.

This was not a perfect performance, with too many opportunities given to a mediocre Slavia side, but Spurs were always in control and have now moved to the edge of the top eight place in the Champions League table that guarantees automatic entry into the knockout phase.

In the Champions League context, it was also the perfect response to the 5-3 loss away to holders Paris St-Germain in their last game, in which Spurs actually played well for an hour before being over-powered by sheer quality.

The heavy defeat was something of an outlier in this campaign, with Spurs securing four clean sheets from their six games so far, conceding seven overall.

If Frank is looking for vital signs of progress, he will also detect them in the improved performances of Xavi Simons in his last two games, making one goal and scoring another against Brentford, followed by another significant contribution against Slavia.

He was joined by Mohammed Kudus in providing real threat â and even competition between themselves when Spurs were awarded two second-half penalties.

Before this, Spurs were given huge assistance with their opening goal after 26 minutes, Slavia defender David Sima directing a header past his own keeper Jindrich Stanek with some aplomb after Cristian Romero had flicked on Pedro Porro's corner.

Spurs' win was sealed with those two second-half spot-kicks, Simons very keen on taking the first before Kudus assumed responsibility successfully, but then getting his chance later when he was brought down by Igoh Ogbu.

Kudus had, at this time, been replaced by Mathys Tel. Captain Romero handed the ball to Simons, who completed the formalities.

Frank, as he was against Brentford, was delighted with Simons, saying: "I think he built on a good game on Saturday, produced again. Good link-up play, nice turns in the middle of the pitch and has acceleration to go past a player.

"I like his work ethic and there was great recovery run on 90 minutes which is crucial for us."

Kudus also drew praise as Frank added: "Mo did well at the start of the season then had a dip. Now, in the past three or four weeks, he's got fresh energy, acceleration and decisiveness in his actions. Getting more in sync with the team too - all that is important."

As with the win against Brentford, Frank will regard this as a vital step forward, not just in pushing Spurs further in the Champions League, but in strengthening his own standing among a fanbase with which he is yet to establish a firm connection.

Victories strengthen bonds and convince doubters â but Frank will know he needs more.

Son's trademark smile looked like it might have to be surgically removed at the final whistle. And on this occasion it was shared by Spurs fans who have occasionally delivered a snarl here this season.

It was the perfectly scripted return for a Spurs legend.

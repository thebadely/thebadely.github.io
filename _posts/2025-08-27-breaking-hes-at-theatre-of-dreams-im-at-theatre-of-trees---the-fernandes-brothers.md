Meet Bruno Fernandes' brother who plays at the 'Theatre of Trees'

One is trying to lead a rebuild of Manchester United, the other is pushing for promotion from the ninth-tier Southern Combination League.

While Bruno Fernandes, 30, leads United out at at the 75,000-capacity Old Trafford, known as the 'Theatre of Dreams', his older brother Ricardo plies his trade 240 miles away in West Sussex at a ground nicknamed the 'Theatre of Trees'.

Roffey FC's home in Horsham had an average attendance of 133 last season and got its nickname because it is surrounded by trees.

The Fernandes brothers may play at opposite ends of English football's pyramid but they are more similar than you would think. 

They wear the number eight, play in central midfield, have both captained their club and score spectacular goals.

"He saw it, it spread on the internet, it was great for me," recalls Ricardo whose strike against Seaford Town in a 2-0 victory in April 2024, still gets shared regularly on social media.

"The way we pass the ball, our style of play is similar. He's at the 'Theatre of Dreams' at Old Trafford, I'm at the 'Theatre of Trees' at Roffey."

"Growing up, the dream was that both of us would be professional, he's made it and I'm pleased I can enjoy it alongside him as well."

The brothers grew up in Porto, with Portugal international Bruno five years younger than Ricardo.

"He always liked to do little tricks and make some tackles," Ricardo tells BBC Radio Sussex, admitting it was "not easy" to control his determination.

"I had to try to protect him in that way. He always wanted to play with the older players, but that is why he went to the top."

Ricardo himself moved to the UK in 2015, five years before Bruno signed for Manchester United, making Sussex his home and started playing at Three Bridges FC.

He worked at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, citing a more "reliable" income as his reason for coming to the UK.

While Bruno's goals are more recognisable, Ricardo Fernandes' strike against Seaford Town racked up millions of views online.

Roffey FC's record attendance came on Non-League Day earlier this year in March, where more than 500 supporters attended and he signed autographs afterwards.

There are now supporters groups in Africa and Portugal, with officials at Roffey noticing new fans most weeks.

"I've signed him twice and he's scored a few goals similar to Bruno," says manager Jack Munday.

"The only difference is Bruno plays at Old Trafford and Ricardo's here."

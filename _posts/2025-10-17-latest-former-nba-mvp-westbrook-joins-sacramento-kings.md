Here’s what you need to know: Russell Westbrook was NBA MVP for the 2016â17 season

Former NBA Most Valuable Player Russell Westbrook has signed with the Sacramento Kings, as he enters his 18th season. 

The 36-year-old played the 2024-25 season with the Denver Nuggets, averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 75 games.

The nine-time All-Star signed for the Kings after becoming a free agent in June, once the Nuggets were eliminated in the Western Conference semi-finals.

Westbrook holds the NBA record for most triple-doubles with 203 and led the NBA in scoring in 2015 and 2017. He joins his seventh team since being drafted in 2008 by the Seattle Supersonics.

He has also played for the Houston Rockets, the Washington Wizards, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers.

"Russell embodies the identity we're striving for in Sacramento," said Kings general manager Scott Perry.

"His resume speaks for itself and I'm excited to work with someone so accomplished, who is fully committed to competing and winning. We expect him to strengthen our point guard position and provide leadership both on and off the court."

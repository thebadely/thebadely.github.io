Here’s what you need to know: Erica Meg Parkinson represented England's Under-19s at the Euros this summer

Erica Meg Parkinson's international football career could go in four directions. 

The 17-year-old was born in Singapore to an English father and a Japanese mother,  and currently plays for Portuguese side Valadares Gaia. 

As a result, Parkinson is eligible to play for Japan, Singapore and current home country Portugal - but she has spent her youth career with England.

She has no intentions to switch allegiances, but Parkinson fully embraces her multicultural upbringing and even speaks four languages. 

"I grew up in Singapore and that really helped me to have a multicultural background as I went to an international school," said Parkinson.

"I was around lots of different people. I knew how to deal with that and appreciate that.

"A lot of people I'm around can speak two or three languages but everyone here on camp only speaks English!

"When we played Portugal in the summer I was able to translate their set-piece routines for the rest of the team which was good."

The talented youngster was called up to England's Under-23s for the first time this month having previously played for the U16s, U17s and U19s, picking up 44 youth team caps in total.

England U23s play Norway at Joie Stadium in Manchester on Thursday (19:00 GMT kick-off), before hosting the USA at Wham Stadium in Accrington on Monday (19:00).

Asked why England was the team Parkinson chose to represent, she said: "England were the first country that invited me into the national training centre.

"They sent a scout out to Portugal to see my games. I was playing with boys at that point. They saw some clips of me online and realised I was half-English.

"Once I got here, I just really liked the culture. Everyone is kind but also ambitious. I enjoyed the way England conducted themselves in the training sessions and the style of play in games."

Parkinson has been playing in Portugal since the age of 10 and was scouted by England a few years into her time there. 

She played for Leixoes and had some involvement with Benfica before breaking into Valadares Gaia's first team in the 2023-24 season.

It is a different style of football so Parkinson has to adjust when she comes to St George's Park to train with the England teams.

"Portugal's style is less focused on the tactical side of things and it's more about passion and fluidity," said Parkinson.

"It's quite similar to the Spanish style of football. When I come here, I have to turn on the tactical side of my brain. I need to be more disciplined. 

"I don't want to change too much because the qualities I bring are because of the type of football I play in Portugal and what I grew up with. 

"Some aspects I try to change, but others are my specialities so I don't want to take them away from my game."

It's been a busy time for Parkinson who was part of the England Under-17s squad who lost to Spain in the World Cup semi-finals in October 2024.

She was also part of the under-19s squad at the Euros in June - they lost to Spain again in their final group game.

"It's been a great year. The Under-17s World Cup was a great experience as it was the first time it felt really professional," said Parkinson.

"I think next year one of my main objectives is to beat Spain!"

According to new developments, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's wedding DJ has given his account of what happened during what he describes as an "awkward" dance between the groom and his mother Victoria.

On Monday, Brooklyn almost broke the internet by posting a series of claims about his famous parents, Sir David and Lady Beckham, including that his mother hijacked his first dance with actress and hedge fund heiress Nicola Peltz.

He claimed his mum, formerly one of the Spice Girls, had "danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone", leaving him feeling "uncomfortable" and "humiliated".

DJ Fat Tony said "the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room".

After rampant speculation over Brooklyn's comment about his mother's dancing, the DJ said: "There was no slutdropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action."

Pop star Marc Anthony performed at the wedding reception and called Brooklyn on to the stage, the DJ, whose real name is Tony Marnoch, told ITV's This Morning on Friday.

"The next minute, everyone was expecting it to be Nicola to go up and do the first dance," he said.

The US singer then called for "the most beautiful woman in the room" to join Brooklyn - before saying Victoria's name instead of Nicola's," Marnoch claimed.

This led to the bride running out of the room in tears, he added.

"Victoria is by the stage, she goes onto the stage, and of course at that point Brooklyn is suddenly, literally, devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife.

"Then Nicola leaves the room crying her eyes out. Brooklyn is stuck there on stage.

"And then they do this dance and Marc Anthony's going, 'Put your hands on your mother's hips'. It was a Latin thing.

"The whole situation was very awkward for everyone in the room."

However, his account differs from other reports, some of which have said the first dance took place between Brooklyn and Nicola earlier, before Anthony's performance began.

British Vogue, who were at the wedding, said Anthony appeared at 11pm and that it was Brooklyn who "invited his mother on stage for a dance".

BBC News has contacted Anthony, who is a singer-songwriter and friend of the Beckhams, for a comment.

Sir David and Lady Beckham have not directly responded to Brooklyn's post or given their side of the story.

Marnoch has DJ'd at "an awful lot of Beckham parties in the past", and they are a "close-knit family" who "love to dance", he said.

Whether that dance was "inappropriate" is down to how Brooklyn feels, he said.

"This is all about how Brooklyn feels. If he feels that it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward."

The following day's brunch was "the most awkward part of it all" because "everything that had gone on at the wedding night was discussed amongst the guests the next morning", the DJ said.

He added that the newlyweds left "devastated", but said the dance "is a very small part of a bigger problem" for the feuding family.

It's "sad" that many people have focused on that part of Brooklyn's statement, Marnoch said.

Mock-ups and memes of Lady Beckham's supposed wedding dance have been flooding the internet all week.

"It's taken a lot for someone to go to social media to post it," he added.

"He wanted to change the narrative. For all of his life he's been called a nepo baby, and 'He should be grateful that he's got the family name'.

"That's what he was born into. I think what we're all missing here is the fact that parents have lost their child, and a son's lost his parents and the rest of his family."

In his explosive Instagram post on Monday, Brooklyn said he did not want to "reconcile" with his family, citing further wedding dress drama and an accusation that his parents put "brand Beckham" first.

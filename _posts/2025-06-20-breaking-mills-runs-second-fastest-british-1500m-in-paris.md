Mills sets PB as Habz breaks French 1500m record

George Mills ran the second fastest time by a Briton in the men's 1500m as he finished third at the Diamond League in Paris.

After beating Sir Mo Farah's long-standing British 5,000m record in Oslo last week, Mills, 26, again bettered Farah to climb to second in the all-time UK list with a time of three minutes 28.36 seconds.

Only Josh Kerr has run the distance faster for Great Britain - in 3:27.79 at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Azzedine Habz won the race in front of his home crowd by clocking 3:27.49 - a meet record and French national record - while Kenya's Phanuel Kipkosgei Koech set a world junior record in second in the non-Diamond League race. 

Great Britain's Amy Hunt took second in the women's 200m with a season best 22.45 to finish behind American Anavia Battle while former world champion Dina Asher-Smith had to settle for sixth despite a quick start.

Georgia Hunter Bell, targeting her second Diamond League win of the season, also finished sixth in the women's 1500m as Ireland's Sarah Healy came second with a personal best 3:57.15, behind Kenya's Nelly Chepchirchir.

The Diamond League will move to Eugene and Monaco next before the series visits the UK for a sold-out London Athletics Meet on 19 July.

The finals will take place in Zurich on 27 and 28 August - just over a fortnight before the start of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan.

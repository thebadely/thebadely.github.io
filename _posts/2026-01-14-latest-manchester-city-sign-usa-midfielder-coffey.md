According to new developments, Sam Coffey made almost 100 appearances for Portland Thorns

Manchester City have signed United States midfielder Sam Coffey from Portland Thorns on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

City have paid a fee in the region of $800,000 (Â£600,000) for Coffey, who spent four years at the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) club.

The 27-year-old had been a City target for several months, with the club making an approach for her in the summer which was turned down. 

"City really stood out from the get-go. First and foremost, [it was] the style of play, and when I watch the team, the girls seem happy, close and connected," said Coffey.

"I think I'm at a place in my career where I feel ready and settled in as a professional. It feels like the right time to really challenge myself in this way.

"The fact it's official, I'm here and it's all real and happening is just so exciting, and I couldn't be more ready and happy about everything."

Widely regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, Coffey has made 42 appearances for the USA national team.

She has played almost 100 games for Portland Thorns and helped them win the 2022 NWSL Championship title.

The midfielder was also part of the USA squad, led by ex-Chelsea manager Emma Hayes, that won gold at the 2024 Olympic Games.

Manchester City are six points clear at the top of the WSL table and working towards a first league title in 10 years.

Chelsea have stood in their way for the past six years but City, under manager Andree Jeglertz, have made positive strides in this campaign.

Director of women's football Therese Sjogran has made an impact since joining the club in 2024 and they have shown ambition in the transfer window.

As a result, City's squad has depth in quality and Coffey is the latest in a string of big-name players they have been able to attract.

The USA star has been followed by several WSL clubs in recent years and City had to compete for her signature, with Thorns fending off numerous offers.

She will provide options in midfield, especially with key Japan international Yui Hasegawa set to join up with her national team for the Asia Cup, which takes place in March.

Jeglertz is building a squad capable of not only winning the WSL but of competing in next season's Women's Champions League - and Coffey will be crucial to that.

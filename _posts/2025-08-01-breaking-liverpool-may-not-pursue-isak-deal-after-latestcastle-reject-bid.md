Experts revealed that Alexander Isak helped Newcastle win the EFL Cup last season

Liverpool claim they are willing to walk away from a move for striker Alexander Isak after Newcastle United rejected their opening offer.

The Magpies, who value the Sweden international at about Â£150m, turned down a bid of Â£110m from the Premier League champions.

BBC Sport understands Liverpool do not think a deal for Isak is achievable this summer as it stands.

It is unclear whether this is a negotiating tactic and if Liverpool will maintain that stance.

The 25-year-old was left out of the Newcastle squad for their pre-season tour of Asia with a "minor thigh injury", according to the club, while he wants to explore a move away despite the Magpies qualifying for this season's Champions League.

The bid from Liverpool was lodged while Isak trains alone at former club Real Sociedad, amid continued uncertainty around his future.

He joined Newcastle in a Â£60m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022. 

'A damaged relationship' - how Isak saga could unfold

BBC Sport reported in July how Liverpool were considering a deal for Isak worth up to Â£130m.

Newcastle have maintained he is not for sale this summer, but that has not prevented Arne Slot's side from taking a major interest.

The Premier League champions made an approach to Newcastle last month before lodging an official bid.

Boss Slot has already made a number of additions to his squad during a heavy summer of spending by the Anfield club.

They have signed Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili and Armin Pecsi for a combined total of about Â£265m without add-ons.

Meanwhile, the departures of Luis Diaz, Jarell Quansah, Caoimhin Kelleher and Trent Alexander-Arnold have recouped an initial Â£115m.

Striker Steven Fletcher has announced "with a heavy heart" he is leaving Wrexham "and not by choice".

The 38-year-old former Scotland international's departure comes as the Hollywood-owned side prepare for life in the Championship after successive promotions.

Fletcher, who scored eight goals as Wrexham won promotion from League One, had been hoping to earn a new deal at the north Wales club.

He posted on social media: "I unfortunately have to announce my departure from what I can only describe as the most magical club I have ever played at!

"In my 22 years of stepping onto a pitch, I have never experienced anything like this club."

Fletcher had been considering retiring when Wrexham's approach prompted his arrival at the Stok Cae Ras on a free in September 2023.

A former Premier League frontman for Burnley, Wolves and Sunderland, Fletcher proved his worth as Wrexham won promotion from League Two, earning a one-year contract-extension last summer.

Fletcher admitted in March he had expected to have returned to retirement, adding that he didn't see "why he would want to stop" given his ongoing impact.

He played a super-sub role as Wrexham returned to the second-tier for the first time in 42 years, with all bar two of his 43 appearances coming off the bench as he again scored eight league goals.

In his exit announcement, Fletcher added: "I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to come here and fall back in love with the game!

"To have had the experiences and the opportunities that this club has given me has been just incredible. And this group of lads are the best that I have ever shared a changing room with.

"It's not just a team or a changing room. This group of boys , fans and staff have been my family for the past two years.

"You welcomed me with open arms and open hearts and made me feel like I had a purpose again."

Fletcher's announcement came after goalkeeper Mark Howard â who had figured in all three of Wrexham's successive promotions â also revealed he would not be staying beyond the end of his current deal.

Wrexham co-owner Rob McElhenney said on social media that such exits were "the worst part", adding: "they are not just players on the team. They are my friends and people I admire".

In response Wrexham director Humphrey Ker posted he was "slightly in awe" of Fletcher "when he arrived at Wrexham, on account of his extraordinary career at the very top of the game".

Ker added: "Now, after two glorious years in his company, I'm even more in awe of him, on account of his abilities, his leadership and friendship. Man who's given me moments of joy that'll last a lifetime."

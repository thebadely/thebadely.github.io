It has been recently reported that Tommy Freeman scored four tries in an impressive win for leaders Northampton

The Prem, cinch Franklin's Gardens

Northampton (17) 43

Tries: Hendy, Pearson (2), Freeman (4) Cons: Smith (4)

Saracens (19) 31

Tries: Burke, J Bracken, Gonzalez, Tizard, Malins Cons: Farrell (3)

Northampton Saints winger Tommy Freeman gave a polite reminder that he remains England's premier winger with four tries to help his side to victory over Saracens.

His first followed tries from full-back George Hendy and flanker Tom Pearson but Saints trailed 19-17 at the break as Fergus Burke, Jack Bracken and Juan Martin Gonzalez went over for Saracens.

Hugh Tizard extended the lead before Northampton rediscovered themselves and Pearson and Freeman both added their second tries to put the hosts back in front.

Freeman took Rory Hutchinson's pass to walk in for his hat-trick before collecting Fin Smith's kick to score his fourth try, either side of Max Malins sliding over for Saracens' fifth.

Amid speculation of how Bath's Henry Arundel, Leicester's Adam Radwan or even Saracens' 19-year-old Noah Caluori could feature for England in the coming weeks, Freeman offered a timely reminder of his international class.

Caluori, who trained with England this week, had a very quiet night with Saints able to exploit his defensive inexperience before he was withdrawn carrying an injury with 15 minutes remaining.

It was Freeman's night as he helped deliver a fourth win in five games for unbeaten Saints and a second defeat for Saracens as the Prem now pauses for the autumn internationals, which begin with England hosting Australia next Saturday.

Freeman began by taking Smith's cross-field kick to break up the right wing before the play was worked left and Smith this time grubbered in behind the Sarries defence, with Hendy collecting to dive over the line.

A second try soon followed as another Smith grubber wasn't grounded by Sarries full-back Malins and Pearson took advantage to touch down. 

And when Smith's superb pass to the right wing freed Hendy, he released Freeman into the corner for Saints' third try.

After finding themselves 17-0 down in the 24th minute, Sarries found a reply as centre Nick Tompkins broke through midfield and sent Burke under the posts.

Burke then turned provider when his kick into the left corner was collected superbly by winger Jack Bracken to touch down.

A succession of penalties then led to a yellow card for Pearson and Gonzalez barged over from close range to give Saracens a two-point lead at half-time.

And six minutes after the break, Sarries had a bonus point as Tom Willis carried almost to the line and Tizard picked and dived over.

But the game turned again as Henry Pollock intercepted Burke's pass to send Saints into Saracens territory, visiting prop Marco Riccioni was sin-binned for deliberate offside, and Saints took advantage from the penalty to work Pearson over for his second try of the night.

Another penalty gave Saints more field position and patient build-up created space for Freeman to coast in for his second try before more close-range work from the forwards created space on the right wing where the England back completed his hat-trick.

At 12 points down, Saracens stayed alive as scrum-half Charlie Bracken took a tap penalty, kicked delicately in behind the defence, gathered himself and passed for Malins to go into the right corner.

But another comeback was snuffed out as Smith's high cross-field kick was taken by Freeman who ran in to finally settle the game and ensure Saints will stay top of the pile until the return to league action in late November.

Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton:

"Both sides went for it today and it had a bit of everything. We stuck at it and showed the tenacity that we've been looking for.

"There was no sense of panic when the lead slipped, they're allowed to be good too and are packed full of good players.

"The momentum shifted heavily in the first half but the character to deal with that and go again in the second half is outstanding."

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: 

"The first 20-odd minutes we were clearly second best. They had a lot of the ball, winning lots of collisions, getting speed of ball and looking really good, and we struggled to stop them, to be honest.

"We did mount a bit of a fightback, which we should be proud of and to go in leading at half-time was good, and they were down to 14 men at the start of that [second] half.

"We had a chance and we took a chance and gave ourselves a bit of a lead, but I didn't really enjoy how it played out from there.

"We threw a long pass, they intercepted and all of a sudden the tide turned quick, and if we want to be the team we want to be, to concede two or three tries quickfire, like we did, it's not what we want to be like."

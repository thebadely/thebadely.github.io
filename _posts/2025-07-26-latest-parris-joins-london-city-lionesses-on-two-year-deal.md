Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Nikita Parris won her first England cap in 2016 and now has more than 70

England forward Nikita Parris has joined newly promoted London City Lionesses on a free transfer from Brighton.

Parris, part of the England squad who won the European Championship in 2022, has signed a two-year contract.

The 31-year-old helped Brighton to their best-ever Women's Super League finish last season, as they ended in fifth.

"It's a very ambitious project," Parris said. "I'm really looking forward to meeting all the girls and getting started."

Parris has previously played for clubs Manchester United, Arsenal and Lyon, winning the Champions League with the latter.

She left Brighton on 22 July as her contract expired.

London City Lionesses director of football Ronald Thompson added: "She brings top-level experience and a winning mentality, and she'll be a brilliant role model for the younger players in our group."

The London club will open their WSL campaign against Arsenal on 6 September.

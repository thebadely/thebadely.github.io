Scorecard. Table

Harry Brook produced a stunning moment of batting genius as Northern Superchargers enjoyed a 36-run win over Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred. 

Superchargers skipper Brook came to the crease with 26 balls left in his side's innings and audaciously scooped his first ball from Tim Southee back over his own head for a breath-taking six.

Dawid Malan top scored with 58 in the Superchargers' total of 193-5, while fellow opener Zak Crawley thumped 45.

Yet it was Brook's tumbling scoop shot which left an indelible mark on the memories of the Headingley crowd and brought the loudest cheer of the night from the Western Terrace.

Brook went on to make an unbeaten 31 off 14 balls as Chris Wood finished the pick of the Phoenix attack with 2-34.

The visitors lost openers Ben Duckett and Will Smeed cheaply as they attempted to chase down the biggest total of this year's tournament so far.

On a day when it was announced he will become England's youngest captain Jacob Bethell gave Phoenix a fighting chance with an aggressive 80-run stand for the fourth wicket with Liam Livingstone.

But when Bethell departed for a 23-ball 48 - via a brilliant caught and bowled from Adil Rashid - that hope ebbed away.

It was effectively over following a fine spell by Rashid as he also snared the key wicket of Phoenix skipper Livingstone - caught in the deep for 46 by Mitch Santner - as the leg-spinner claimed 2-26. 

Victory for the Superchargers saw them move top of the table in The Hundred on 12 points from four games, while Phoenix are bottom of the table with four points.

'What a shot!' - Brook hits unorthodox scoop six on first ball

According to CricViz, Brook's outrageous opening shot was just the 11th time in the history of T20/100-ball cricket where a batter has scooped their first ball of the innings for six.

The other player to have achieved the same feat in The Hundred was Steve Eskinazi for Welsh Fire off Southern Brave's Craig Overton in 2023.

When asked about the shot, Brook told Sky Sports he "just fancied it" and "backed myself" to execute it.

"I haven't had any plans," he added. "I have hit my first ball for four or six three times in the comp and I haven't had a plan to do that."

That it came off former New Zealand international Southee, who was engaged as England's bowling coach this summer, added an extra element of intrigue.

There will doubtless be some gentle ribbing to come for Southee from England's limited-overs captain.

Brook's eye-catching shot - which travelled 36 metres - even prompted a particularly bold declaration from former England fast bowler Stuart Broad.

"He might just be the best batter we've ever produced you know, Harry Brook. Big shout so I don't say it lightly," Broad said on X.

It seemed scandalous, though, that Brook only faced 14 balls, potentially depriving the Headingley crowd of both entertainment and more runs towards the Superchargers total.

Michael Pepper, who batted at number three, had struggled early on to hit the ball cleanly, while Brook was sat watching him chew up deliveries.

A couple of lusty blows got Pepper's strike-rate up to 133.33 when he was out for a 21-ball 28, but that was still way below Brook's 221.42.

It raised the interesting question of whether Superchargers coach Andrew Flintoff might have considered asking Pepper to retire out?

It would have been a controversial step, but not one without precedent in The Hundred.

In fact there have been three instances: Sam Billings, Wayne Madsen and Imad Wasim all retired out during the 2024 tournament.

Even if he likes batting at four, Brook should consider moving himself up a place for their next match.

There's four matches in The Hundred on Saturday.

Trent Rockets women face Southern Brave at 11:00 BST at Trent Bridge with the men's game between the two sides starting at 14:30.

Oval Invincibles women face their Welsh Fire counterparts at 14:30 at The Oval - match which is live on BBC iPlayer - before the men's sides lock horns at 18:00. 

The men's match is on BBC Two and iPlayer.

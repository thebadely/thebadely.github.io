Let's dive into the details: Cristiano Ronaldo has won a world record 223 caps for Portugal

Cristiano Ronaldo has become football's first billionaire player, according to financial information and media firm Bloomberg.

The Bloomberg Billionaires Index,, external which tracks the world's richest people based on their net worth, has measured the 40-year-old Portugal and Al-Nassr striker's wealth for the first time.

The valuation takes into account career earnings, investments and endorsements and says Ronaldo's net worth is $1.4bn (Â£1.04bn).

It says he earned more than $550m (Â£410m) in salary between 2002 and 2023, and breaks down his reported earnings through deals and sponsorship, including a decade-long deal with Nike worth almost $18m (Â£13.4m) a year.

When Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League in 2022 he reportedly became the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of Â£177m.

His contract was due to end in June 2025 but he signed a new two-year deal - reportedly worth more than $400m (Â£298m) - which will keep him at the club beyond his 42nd birthday.

Argentina and Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi, who played against Ronaldo for many years during their time in Spain, has earned more than $600m (Â£447m) in pre-tax salary during his career, according to Bloomberg.

That includes $20m (Â£15m) in guaranteed annual pay since 2023, which is about 10% of Ronaldo's income during the same period.

When he retires, 38-year-old Messi is set to get a stake in Inter Miami.

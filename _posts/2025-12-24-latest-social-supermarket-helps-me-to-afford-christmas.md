It has been recently reported that A customer of a social supermarket has said she "can afford a few extras for Christmas" thanks to the money she saves there on her weekly groceries.

Yazz Gough, who goes to the Re:dish Good Stuff in the Reddish area of Stockport, Greater Manchester, said: "I save a fortune because I've got two teenage kids at home who never stop eating!"

The 56-year old said: "I buy a lot of the fresh fruit and vegetables to make things like apple strudels, chips or shepherd's pie, so it has cut the cost of my midweek shop."

Red:ish Good Stuff - open twice a week and funded by Stockport Council and local businesses including Vernon Building Society - charges customers £4 a week. So far it has about 330 members.

The social supermarket opened in June 2024 to offer low-cost, good quality, fresh and healthy food to people in Reddish, Heaton Norris and Heaton Chapel who are struggling with the cost of their weekly groceries.

Social supermarkets typically operate on a membership model.

It costs £5 to become a member of the Re:dish Good Stuff and £4 for each visit.

Members can choose one item from each table/freezer/area plus several items of fruit and vegetables.

The charity collects surplus food from large supermarkets and wholesalers which would otherwise go to waste.

For example, they sell excess seasonal goods like ice cream, which supermarkets struggle to sell in cold weather.

The choice of household groceries varies each week, depending upon what is available.

Re:dish's CEO Lynn Brandwood said: "The main difference between us and a food bank is that there's no referral needed, so it's open to everybody in the community.

"You get shown around by a personal shopper so you get the chance for a chat and the savings mean there's money for rent, bills, Christmas presents or a night out."

Social supermarkets typically place an emphasis on fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as frozen items which can be used to create a meal.

Sue Bredbury, from Reddish, said: "I picked up luxury items like strawberries and ice cream today but getting the vegetables here really means I can save money."

The 63-year-old added: "Being able to come here and pay £4 to get the bulk of the week's shopping is amazing."

Re:dish Good Stuff store also stocks seasonal items like Christmas crackers.

Mandy Carter, also from Reddish, told BBC Radio Manchester: "Each week is different, so it could be potatoes, onions, tomatoes and carrots to help make things like soup."

The 69-year-old added: "It helps me out a lot, so I'm not worried about putting on the central heating to keep the house warm and I live quite well."

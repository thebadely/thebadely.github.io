England complete series whitewash over Samoa after Farnworth double

Coaches will tell you it's a welcome problem, but Shaun Wane has enough England selection headaches for a full-on migraine before confirming his squad for the autumn Ashes Test series with Australia on Monday.

He has a halves conundrum that might have stumped Stephen Hawking. He has a glut of prolific three-quarters to choose from. And he has a dilemma at hooker.

Australia named their squad last Monday - does that influence the choices? Or do England focus on backing themselves and their system?

England are seeking a first series win since 1970 - with the first Test at Wembley, the second at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium and the third at AMT Headingley.

Here are the main puzzles for Wane to solve as he decides who to select for the challenge - and you can have your say in the comments below as to who you would pick and why.

Perhaps Wane's biggest call is with the halves.

Last autumn's series clean sweep against Samoa was secured with Wane's safe bet - captain George Williams at stand-off and Wigan's Harry Smith at scrum-half.

The pair, graduates of Wigan's academy set-up, are Wane stalwarts. They complement each other's styles. 

Warrington's Williams provides the running threat and creativity; Wigan's Smith provides game management and a monster kicking game.

But spicing up the mix this time are two stars of 2025.

Hull KR beat Wigan to win first Super League title

Mikey Lewis produced an impeccable performance as Hull KR beat Wigan in Saturday's Super League Grand Final; scoring a try and laying on another, while controlling the game from stand-off with a teasing and varied kicking game.

Throw in Man of Steel winner Jake Connor, an assist machine and genuine gamebreaker after a season of achievement at Leeds, and suddenly the safe bet is under threat.

Wane is clearly a fan of Lewis, who he used as an impact interchange last year, having given him a debut against Tonga to great effect in 2023.

Connor has shown much control and maturity under Rhinos coach Brad Arthur - but he wasn't called up for England's squad get-together in June, with Wane indicating at the time that he wanted more consistency from the 30-year-old.

What is clear is that Australia will take some unlocking, and it might take the unorthodox to do it. On that basis, there are reasons for picking all four in the squad - Williams, Smith, Lewis and Connor.

'He's shouting pick me' - has Lewis played way into England's Ashes team?

Hull KR beat Wigan in Grand Final to complete treble

Having stood up to the ferocious might of Tonga in 2023 and Samoa in 2024, England's forward pack is generally less of a concern for Wane, but there are a few questions to answer.

The advancing ages of Alex Walmsley and Thomas Burgess, plus the retirement of Chris Hill, mean England must start looking to the future in terms of front-rowers in particular.

It would be risky to turn the Kangaroos blow torch on a young prospect - but there are players with international experience who have shown their mettle in 2025.

Mike McMeeken was a colossus for Wakefield. Matty Lees was a consistent force in a mixed year for St Helens. Luke Thompson, before and after his calf injury, was a presence for Wigan.

In terms of those whose form has played them in, you can't look further than Owen Trout at Leigh.

Rangy, athletic, and fearless, the Wakefield-born forward can do the hard yards up front or run a little wider in the back row.

Away from the front row: North Queensland back-rower John Bateman has credit to his name and so will likely play, and Wigan's Junior Nsemba has the physical attributes to ruffle Aussie feathers.

Kai Pearce-Paul has been an imposing figure in the NRL and his offload game will be a genuine weapon for England if he is selected.

There is also the option of Dean Hadley, who has been superb for champions Hull KR. At 33, he still has the work-rate of a young pup and can also operate across the pack.

Who will replace Victor Radley at loose forward? It has to be Dolphins-bound Morgan Knowles. How lucky England are to have that quality to step up.

Of the other options, Hadley's club-mate Elliot Minchella has done a fine job in 2025. Canberra's Morgan Smithies is another contender.

Good hookers love to play amid strong packs - and in that scenario, Hull KR's Jez Litten would be among the front-runners.

Dynamic from dummy-half, with a strong kicking game and evasive footwork, Litten is much improved defensively in 2025.

If he takes one spot, who else steps up? St Helens' Daryl Clark has been Wane's regular pick, with his experience and varied style. Brad O'Neill, meanwhile, has been an excellent defensive nine for Wigan.

England's Radley rules himself out of Ashes

Australia's attacking threat is clear to anyone who saw Reece Walsh and Kotoni Staggs run riot in Brisbane Broncos' NRL Grand Final win over Melbourne Storm.

So who can provide England's magic?

Jack Welsby has had an injury-disrupted season and been shifted about like a chess piece at St Helens in their bid to solve their attacking puzzle.

However, there is consensus that he is England's best full-back and has international credit in the bank for his displays over the past couple of years.

Lewis Martin has shown huge promise with his performances in 2025, finishing as the league's top scorer in an improved Hull FC campaign

The three-quarter line offers so many options, despite the loss of Matty Ashton to a season-ending injury.

Out wide, Hull's speedy Lewis Martin - a former Hull City youth footballer - was Super League's top scorer, but is this too early for him?

Dom Young, who left Sydney Roosters for Newcastle mid-season, has been a rampaging force out wide for England, athletic and powerful.

Joe Burgess has three England caps but has not been in the reckoning of late, despite scoring regularly for Salford and now Hull KR. His team-mate Tom Davies is another who does great work out of back-field as well as out wide - but he only has one cap.

Liam Marshall scored on his England debut against Samoa last November, after several prolific seasons with Wigan, and will surely be considered.

Herbie Farnworth, arguably one of the best players in the world, has sewn up one of the centre spots, so who goes in alongside?

Jake Wardle has had another impressive season at Wigan, while Harry Newman - who Wane has shown faith in during recent series - was again a regular for Leeds.

Roosters' Billy Smith and Gold Coast utility AJ Brimson, two Australia-born players, might come into consideration but will have to impose their desire and passion on Wane if they are to get the nod.

So who should make Wane's Ashes squad? Share your thoughts below.

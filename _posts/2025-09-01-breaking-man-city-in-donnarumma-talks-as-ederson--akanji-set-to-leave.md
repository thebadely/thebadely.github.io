Here’s what you need to know: Gianluigi Donnarumma has won 74 caps for Italy

Manchester City are in advanced talks to sign goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain for a fee of just over Â£30m, with Ederson set to join Turkish side Fenerbahce.

Donnarumma has become surplus to requirements at Ligue 1 and Champions League winners PSG following the signing of Lucas Chevalier from Lille.

With his contract up at the end of this season, the Italian now looks set to join City in a deal costing Â£30.3m (35m euros) before Monday's 19:00 BST deadline.

City signed James Trafford from Burnley for Â£27m in the summer and the Englishman has started the campaign as number one, but sources have told BBC Sport a deal for Donnarumma is expected to be completed.

Regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, the 26-year-old has won 74 caps for Italy and was the hero in their penalty shootout victory over England in the Euro 2020 final.

Meanwhile, Serie A side Inter Milan have agreed to take City defender Manuel Akanji on loan for one million euros (Â£870,000).

The deal includes an option to make the move permanent for 15m euros (Â£13m) and becomes an obligation if Inter win Serie A.

The 30-year-old Swiss international has not featured for City this season and had interest from Crystal Palace, AC Milan and Galatasaray, but his preference was to move to a club playing in the Champions League.

Will Man City replace Ederson with Donnarumma?

Brazil's Ederson had been City's first choice from 2017 until the start of this season, but a Â£12.1m (14m euros) move to Fenerbahce has been agreed by the clubs.

The 32-year-old won six Premier League titles, plus the Champions League and FA Cup, after joining from Benfica for Â£35m, but has not featured this season.

City have four senior goalkeepers on their books and sources close to Stefan Ortega have told BBC Sport the German goalkeeper is aiming to move away from City before the window closes. Marcus Bettinelli arrived from Chelsea in the summer on a free transfer.

Guardiola's team opened the season with a 4-0 victory at Wolves but have since suffered back-to-back Premier League defeats against Tottenham and Brighton.

Donnarumma's move to Manchester City looks increasingly likely, so how does the Italian compare to their current crop of goalkeepers and will he fit in Pep Guardiola's system?

The 26-year-old's availability is thought to be related to his ability with the ball at his feet, with PSG head coach Luis Enrique stating he was "looking for a goalkeeping profile that is different".

Guardiola also requires his goalkeepers to be brave on the ball and even initiate attacks. The outgoing Ederson is an excellent passer and has contributed a Premier League record eight assists by a goalkeeper in his time at the club, with four of those coming last season.

Donnarumma is yet to provide an assist but his passing accuracy in the French top flight was 85.4% last season, just below the Brazilian's Premier League percentage and above that of Stefan Ortega.

It is his save percentage of 66.2% that is surprising. He kept just four clean sheets in 24 league starts and conceded almost four goals more than he should have according to Opta, with his goals prevented total at -3.6.

Donnarumma has posted far better numbers in previous seasons and also during PSG's successful 2024-25 Champions League campaign, where he kept out more than 70% of shots faced. He is also formidable when facing penalties and has saved almost one in four spot-kicks.

Donnarumma remains an elite shot-stopper with an exceptional reach and dominance in one-on-one situations, and is not as bad on the ball as some critics would suggest. He would probably improve most Premier League teams, even City.

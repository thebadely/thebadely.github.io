Experts revealed that Mark Allen's English Open success was his 12th triumph in a ranking event

Home favourite Mark Allen edged out Ben Woollaston 4-3 in a tense second-round match on Wednesday to progress at the Northern Ireland Open.

In a scrappy start to the encounter at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, Allen won the first frame but Woollaston fought back to make it 2-1, before the Antrim player bounced back with breaks of 100 and 135 to lead 3-2.

An 80 clearance saw the English player draw level, but the world number eight prevailed in a nervy decider to secure victory and a meeting with Aaron Hill from the Republic of Ireland in round three.

Hill is a three-time ranking event quarter-finalist and has compiled maximum 147 breaks at both the English Open and Xi'an Grand Prix in recent weeks.

"Aaron is a great kid and he's had a really good start to the season. He is starting to show what I have seen for a number of years," Allen told BBC Sport NI. 

"His confidence is high and I'm sure he'll be wanting to put me in my place in Belfast.

"It's up to me to me to go out there and stop him.  I think he is destined for big things in the game, so I need to go out there and play well.

"If it's not this week for Aaron, I still think he will do really big things soon."

Another Northern Ireland player, Jordan Brown, followed up his opening-round 4-0 win over world champion Zhao Xintong by beating Ashley Hugill by the same scoreline.

The 2021 Welsh Open champion, who has struggled for form in recent years, faces in-form Shaun Murphy in the next round. 

"It's just nice to feel that I'm playing somewhere near the way I can, show people what I can do. I'm feeling comfortable out there," said Brown.

"I've needed to reflect on those memories of winning the Welsh Open as I've been struggling with confidence.

"Reflecting on those good times reminds me that I'm a good player and what I'm capable of."

If Allen and Brown prevail in their respective quarter-finals they will face off in an all-Northern Ireland quarter-final match. 

Earlier in the day, this season's British Open winner and Xi'an Grand Prix finalist Murphy progressed to round three with a 4-2 win over Elliot Slessor.

"While there were no big centuries I was pleased that when I did get my chance I was able to take it," said Murphy.

"I'm chasing some of my own personal goals, working hard between matches and between tournaments. There's plenty left in the tank so as long as I'm in the tournament I'll keep punching.

"It's a long time since I played in a one-table set-up here, it's not been a happy hunting ground for me for nearly two decades but it's not been for the want of trying.

"I can't wait to try to go further in the tournament. It's one of my favourites, I love it here in Belfast, the people, the crowd, the venue."

World number 15 Gary Wilson booked a last-16 meeting with world number one and four-time NI Open winner Judd Trump by beating Martin O'Donnell 4-2 and China's Si Jiahui whitewashed Stephen Maguire 4-0.

Trump is aiming for a first title since winning the UK Championship last December and a first semi-final appearance in a ranking event this season.

Jack Lisowski, ranked 29, upset four-time world champion Mark SeIby 4-2 and will play Thepchaiya Un-Nooh next, after the Thailand cueist defeated Mark Davis 4-1.

He Guoqiang was a 4-2 victor over fellow Chinese player Wu Yize, with defending champion Kyren Wilson or Ryan Day his next opponent.

Zhou Yuelong emerged a 4-2 winner over David Grace to secure his berth in round three.

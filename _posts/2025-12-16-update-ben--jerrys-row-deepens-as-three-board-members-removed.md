Experts revealed that Three members of Ben & Jerry's independent board will no longer be eligible to serve in their roles, after the ice cream company introduced a new set of governance practices. 

These include a nine-year limit set on board members' terms. Chair Anuradha Mittal, who earlier said she had no plans to resign under pressure, is among those affected.

The move was criticised by the company's co-founder Ben Cohen, who called it a "blatant power grab designed to strip the board of legal authority and independence".

His remarks are the latest in a long-running row between Ben and Jerry's and its owner over the Cherry Garcia maker's social activism and the continued independence of its board.

The BBC understands that Ms Mittal will leave the company immediately, while board members Daryn Dodson and Jennifer Henderson will go at the end of this year.

"Anuradha Mittal, Daryn Dodson, and Jennifer Henderson have served this company with integrity and courage. Over many years, they helped the board make bold, often difficult decisions to uphold Ben & Jerry's social mission," said Mr Cohen.

Ben & Jerry's said the move is aimed "to preserve and enhance the brand's historical social mission and safeguard its essential integrity."

The Vermont-based firm is now owned by The Magnum Ice Cream Company, after a spinoff from Unilever last week that created the world's largest standalone ice cream maker.

A spokesperson for Magnum said the firm wanted to build and strengthen Ben & Jerry's "powerful, non-partisan values-based position in the world".

But Ben & Jerry's would be destroyed as a brand if it remains with Magnum, Mr Cohen told the BBC.

Ben & Jerry's was sold to Unilever in 2000 in a deal which allowed it to retain an independent board and the right to make decisions about its social mission.

Since the sale there have been deepening clashes between the brand and Unilever, with this conflict now inherited by Magnum.

In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel, resulting in its Israeli operation being sold by Unilever to a local licensee.

Co-founder Jerry Greenfield left Ben & Jerry's in September after almost half a century at the firm, deepening a dispute with parent company Unilever.

In a letter shared on social media by Mr Cohen, Mr Greenfield said Ben & Jerry's had lost its independence after Unilever put a halt to its social activism.

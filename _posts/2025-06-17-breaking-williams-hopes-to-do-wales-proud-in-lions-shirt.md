According to new developments, Tomos Williams has played 65 internationals for Wales

Scrum-half Tomos Williams hopes he and Jac Morgan can do Wales proud when they play for the British and Irish Lions.

Gloucester's Williams and Ospreys flanker Morgan are the only two Wales players in Andy Farrell's 38-man squad, which will face Argentina on Friday night in Dublin before the nine-match tour of Australia.

It is Wales' lowest contingent for almost 100 years after a record run of 17 international defeats and back-to-back Six Nations wooden spoons.

"I try not to put too much pressure on myself, but it is just me and Jac [from Wales]," said Williams.

"I don't want to speak for him but we are so hugely proud.

"It is such an honour to represent your country and the Lions and hopefully we can do them proud."

'Everyone has their opinion. It's the beauty of sport'

12 from Leinster, two from Wales - the Lions squad in numbers

Williams says he hopes to follow in the Lions footsteps of outstanding Wales scrum-halves Sir Gareth Edwards, Brynmor Williams, Terry Holmes, Robert Jones, Rob Howley, Dwayne Peel, Mike Phillips and Gareth Davies. 

Williams was named Gallagher Premiership Player of the Season after a standout debut campaign with Gloucester.

The 30-year-old joined the west country club from Cardiff in 2024 and helped them to a fifth-placed finish in the Premiership, narrowly missing out on the play-offs by two points.

"Being in Wales was pretty tough, especially over the last couple of years playing internationally," said Williams.

"I think the move to Gloucester helped me a lot and given me a break from the international rugby as well and it is nice to go back there.

"The way we played suited me and I have got a lot to thank Gloucester for."

Williams' performances saw him named in the Lions squad alongside England's Alex Mitchell and Ireland number nine Jamison Gibson-Park, who missed Leinster's United Rugby Championship (URC) final win against Bulls on Saturday.

The Lions will play three Tests against Australia in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney 

Williams has been impressed by the approach of Lions head coach Farrell.

"I think he has such an aura around the place," said Williams.

"Everybody turns their heads when he speaks.

"The level of detail and clarity he gives you is class."

Following a warm weather training week in Portugal where he shared a room with England fly-half Fin Smith, Williams is in line to be involved in the warm-up fixture against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium on Friday, 20 June (20:00 BST).

"It is about trying to put what we worked out in the week," said Williams.

"It has been a pretty short period to get things going. Hopefully we can see how we have trained and put it into practice on the pitch and that will be half the battle. 

"It is not putting too much pressure on ourselves, getting that game plan in place and playing the way we want to play."

According to new developments, The Princess of Wales has spoken candidly about the life-changing long-term challenges of recovering after chemotherapy, as she visited a hospital in Essex.

Catherine said during treatment "you put on a sort of brave face" but afterwards it can still feel "really difficult".

She told patients at the hospital about life after cancer treatment: "You're not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to."

It was Catherine's first public engagement since pulling out of an appearance at Royal Ascot, when it was said she needed to find the right balance in her return to work.

In January, Catherine announced she was in remission from cancer, which had been diagnosed last year. But her latest comments are a reminder how this is a gradual path to recovery.

She said: "You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment, treatment's done - then it's like 'I can crack on, get back to normal'.

"But actually the phase afterwards is really difficult, you're not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you're not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to," said the princess.

"But it's life-changing for anyone, through first diagnosis or post treatment and things like that, it is a life-changing experience both for the patient but also for the families as well. 

"And actually it sometimes goes unrecognised, you don't necessarily, particularly when it's the first time, appreciate how much impact it is going to have. 

"You have to find your new normal and that takes time... and it's a rollercoaster it's not one smooth plane, which you expect it to be. But the reality is it's not, you go through hard times," said Catherine.

The princess was in a conversation with a group of patients - and one told her: "It can be very discombobulating, in that time when you've finished active treatment."

"Your reality has completely changed," the patient told the princess.

Catherine talked of the need for recovery time: "There is this whole phase when you finish your treatment that you, yourself, everybody, expects you, right you've finished your time, go, you're better, and that's not the case at all."

There had been much attention paid when the princess did not take part in an engagement at the Ascot racecourse.

But royal sources say that her comments on Tuesday will send an important message of support for other former cancer patients who are facing challenges in their own journey of recovery.

She made the comments as she visited a "well-being garden" at Colchester, which helps to use nature to support patients in their recovery from illness.

Catherine has spoken of the healing power of the natural world and how it has been a source of strength for her during her return from illness. She has described nature as her "sanctuary".

In May, the Royal Horticultural Society launched a "Catherine's rose", which was sold to raise funds for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, at a hospital where the princess had been treated.

There are 50 of this variety of rose that have been donated to Colchester Hospital, with the princess helping to plant the roses during her visit.

The well-being garden at the hospital is intended to provide a place to relax and recuperate for patients, recognising how nature can help people to feel better, both in their physical and mental health.

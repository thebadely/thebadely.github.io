'Give us respect' - McIlroy swears at fans amid jeering

A furious Rory McIlroy swore at American fans during a heated moment in Saturday's foursomes in the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. 

The Northern Irishman was preparing to hit his approach to the 16th green when he was heckled by members of the crowd, with one shouting "freedom". 

The European talisman, who had earlier responded to abuse on the first tee by blowing kisses towards the spectators, backed off from his shot and said: "Guys, shut the **** up."

The remark drew jeers from the crowd, but McIlroy followed up his comment in the most effective way possible - by firing his iron shot from the rough to within three feet of the flag.

The shot edged the Masters champion and England's Tommy Fleetwood towards a 3&2 victory for Europe over United States duo Harris English and Collin Morikawa.

"I don't mind them having a go at us. That's to be expected. That's what an away Ryder Cup is," said McIlroy.

"Whenever they are still doing it while you are over the ball and trying to hit your shot, that's the tough thing. In between shots, say whatever you want to me. That's totally fine.

"But just give us the respect to let us hit shots, and give us the same chance that the Americans have."

There was a more positive exchange on the 16th green. One fan shouted: "How you liking Long Island Rory, thumbs up or down?" McIlroy flashed back a smile and a raised thumb.

McIlroy and Fleetwood's handsome win helped Europe establish a commanding 8Â½ - 3Â½ lead at the end of Saturday's foursomes as they look to win in the US for the first time since 2012.

But the disruption continued into his afternoon fourball match alongside Shane Lowry. 

McIlroy backed off a putt after a catcall from the crowd on the fourth green, leading to him talking with a rules official about the incident, asking if anything could be done to stop the shouting while he was over his ball. 

His playing partner Shane Lowry then drained a hole-winning eagle putt and wildly celebrated, animatedly pointing and shouting an expletive in the vicinity of where the original abuse had come from.

Trump welcomed at Ryder Cup amid partisan atmosphere

'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?

Five-time major champion McIlroy has previously said he felt that he engaged too much with rowdy home supporters during the 17-11 loss to the US at Hazeltine in 2016 and not enough four years ago in the heavy 19-9 defeat at Whistling Straits. 

There have been several examples of visiting players receiving abuse from fans at Bethpage Black, with McIlroy, Ireland's Lowry and Scotland's Robert MacIntyre among those especially targeted over the first two days.

However, it has not been as hostile as 1999's 'Battle of Brookline', which was the previous Ryder Cup to be staged in New York.

Tickets for the three days of competition start at $750 (Â£560) per person and there is a suggestion that there is more of a corporate audience at Bethpage as a result of those hefty prices.

In addition, Europe's sparkling performance is also likely to have quelled some of the expected "bear pit" atmosphere.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Dame Laura Davies, who is Europe's most most successful Solheim Cup player, added: "Luke [Donald] told them what was coming, but because of how they have played, they have not had to put up with much. 

"What Rory did, using a bit of bad language, got his message across and if they are sensible they [the home fans] won't try and provoke the European players."

Here’s what you need to know: Jobs are set to be cut at ceramics firm Wedgwood in the latest blow to the industry in Stoke-on-Trent.

The number of workers affected has yet to be clarified, but union bosses described the news from the Barlaston factory as "another body blow" for the sector.

Wedgwood began a 90-day pause in production in September, blaming low demand, with 70 employees put on temporary leave.

In a statement on Thursday, Owner Fiskars Group said it was "committed to continuing this iconic brand's legacy" but also needed to take "measured steps to align production with demand, manufacturing costs and supply chain evolution".

The GMB union has repeatedly made calls for more support to help futureproof the ceramics sector, following a number of pottery firms facing difficulties.

Those which went bust in 2025 included Royal Stafford and Heraldic Pottery as well as Moorcroft Pottery, which was later bought by the grandson of the firm's founder.

Chris Hoofe, GMB organiser, said the announcement on Thursday was "more evidence, if any was needed, to meet GMB's demands of the government to act and support the sector."

He added: "GMB will be entering into consultation over the proposed redundancies and fighting to mitigate any compulsory job losses.

"The workers at Wedgwood are highly skilled and dedicated employees who are affected by circumstances beyond their control.

"GMB union will do everything we can to support them at this incredibly difficult time."

The company's skilled workers still use techniques pioneered by the firm's founder.

They produce high-end and bespoke designs, including handcrafted fine bone China pieces and Jasperware, a type of pottery developed in the 18th Century by founder Josiah Wedgwood.

Ahead of the shutdown last year, Tom Hammersley, marketing manager at Staffordshire Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC that the drop in demand at Wedgwood had come against a backdrop of increasing costs.

"Wedgwood has huge global demand in areas including China and Japan," he said.

"If that demand is slowing, and married with the increasing costs, it is a huge concern."

One of the main challenges faced by the industry in recent years has been high energy prices.

In its latest statement, the firm said it had been "proud to help preserve the tradition of pottery-making in Staffordshire by leading Wedgwood through some immensely challenging and complex global market dynamics since our acquisition".

"As part of our ongoing operational review, production at our Barlaston factory is to focus on high-end, hand-crafted products, including Jasperware and Prestige Bone China, maintaining unique, local skills," the firm said.

"Sadly, this will necessitate a reduction in the number of roles at Barlaston. We are commencing a standard 30-day consultation and will work closely with the workforce and trade unions to ensure that those affected receive correct support.

"By taking this step, we are ensuring the famous Wedgwood name and the Staffordshire craftsmanship associated with it continue."

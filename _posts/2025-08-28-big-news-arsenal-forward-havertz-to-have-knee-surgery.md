Let's dive into the details: Kai Havertz played 30 minutes for Arsenal against Manchester United on the opening day of the season

Arsenal forward Kai Havertz will have surgery on a knee injury, but is not expected to be out for a significant amount of time.

The 26-year-old featured in the opening win over Manchester United from the substitutes' bench, but missed the 5-0 victory over Leeds with the problem.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said before the Leeds match that "we need more time" before determining what course of action Havertz's injury required.

The hope is that the Germany international will be out for weeks rather than months. 

That will give Arteta some relief as he is already without winger Bukayo Saka, midfielders Martin Odegaard and Christian Norgaard, defender Ben White and forward Gabriel Jesus through injury.

Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres is the club's only fit striker and scored his first two Premier League goals against Leeds.

Havertz's injury accelerated Arsenal's move for England attacker Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace and the Â£60m signing has started training with the Gunners.

Arsenal face champions Liverpool on Sunday at Anfield with both sides having won their opening two league matches of the season.

Here’s what you need to know: Pat Cummins made his Test debut for Australia in 2011

Australia's Pat Cummins has been ruled out of the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka because of a troubling back injury.

Test captain Cummins, 32, managed just one appearance in his side's 4-1 Ashes win over England, with his back causing him issues for more than six months.

Australia kept him in the provisional World Cup squad, but have opted for Ben Dwarshuis in the final squad, with Matt Short also left out for former Test opener Matthew Renshaw, who only made his T20 debut this week.

"With Pat needing more time to recover from his back injury, Ben is a ready replacement who offers a left-arm pace option as well as dynamic fielding and late-order hitting," selector Tony Dodemaide said.

"We believe his ability to swing the ball at good pace along with clever variations will be well suited to the conditions we expect and overall structure of the squad."

Australia, who are captained by Mitchell Marsh, are currently playing a three-match T20 series in Pakistan as part of their preparation for the tournament.

Veteran batsman Steve Smith was unable break into the World Cup squad despite his strong form in the Big Bash League.

They begin their World Cup campaign against Ireland on 11 February in Colombo.

"With the top order settled and spin-heavy conditions expected in the pool stages in Sri Lanka, we also feel Matt provides extra middle-order support, with Tim David completing his return-to-play program in the early phase of the tournament," Dodemaide said of Renshaw's selection.

"As a left-hander, he also offers a point of difference to the middle-order batting."

Australia World Cup squad: Mitchell Marsh (captain), Travis Head, Xavier Bartlett, Josh Hazlewood, Cooper Connolly, Josh Inglis, Tim David, Matthew Kuhnemann, Ben Dwarshuis, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Matthew Renshaw, Nathan Ellis, Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa.

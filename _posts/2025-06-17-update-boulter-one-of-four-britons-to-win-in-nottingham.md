Boulter off to 'flying start' at Nottingham

Two-time defending champion Katie Boulter was one of four Britons to advance at the Nottingham Open on day two but Brazilian top seed Beatriz Haddad Maia was knocked out.

Britain's Boulter needed just 75 minutes to beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-2 6-2 in the first round.

Boulter saved all four break points she faced against Sun, who reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon as a qualifier last year.

The Englishwoman was joined in the second round by Sonay Kartal, Francesca Jones and Welsh teenager Mimi Xu.

But there was an upset in the final match of the day when the tournament's highest-ranked player Haddad Maia - the world number 21 - was beaten 7-5 6-7 (3-7) 7-5 by American McCartney Kessler.

Kartal, the British number three behind Emma Raducanu and Boulter, beat French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean 6-3 6-4.

That came after Jones beat compatriot Harriet Dart 7-5 6-4 and Xu claimed her first WTA Tour main-draw win with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Katie Volynets.

There is guaranteed to be at least one British player in the quarter-finals, with Boulter facing Kartal on Thursday.

"I've played enough of them now," Boulter said of playing her compatriot.

"I have so much respect for Sonay, she's an incredible tennis player. I've always said to her she's going to pass my ranking.

"We played a really close match on grass quite a few years ago so I know it's going to be an absolute battle."

Boulter spoke afterwards about the support she had received after speaking to BBC Sport about the online abuse she and other players face.

Elsewhere, Xu claimed an impressive victory over American Volynets, who is 254 places above her in the world rankings.

Xu, 17, held firm in a second set that featured six breaks of serve to beat the world number 96 and set up a meeting with Poland's Magda Linette.

"I had to trust in my game and in myself. I've been playing a lot on the grass, and I'm going to use that to my advantage," Xu said.

"I love having no pressure on me, playing above my ranking."

Meanwhile, at the grass-court event in Berlin, 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova beat world number six Madison Keys 7-5 7-6 (8-6).

The win over Australian Open champion Keys is Vondrousova's first over a top-10 player this year as she continues her return from a lengthy shoulder injury.

Queen's runner-up Amanda Anisimova also advanced, beating Bianca Andreescu 6-4 6-3.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka struggled in her first grass-court match of the year, losing 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 to Liudmila Samsonova.

Osaka had three chances to break Samsonova at 5-5 in the second set but could not take them and the Russian then pulled away in the final set.

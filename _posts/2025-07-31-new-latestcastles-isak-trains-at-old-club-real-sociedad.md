Experts revealed that Alexander Isak spent three years at Real Sociedad before joining Newcastle

Alexander Isak is training alone at former club Real Sociedad amid continued uncertainty around his Newcastle United future.

The Sweden striker was left out of Newcastle's squad for their pre-season tour of Asia, with the club saying he had a "minor" thigh issue.

Isak wants to explore a move away from the Magpies, with Liverpool interested in signing the former Borussia Dortmund striker.

The 25-year-old joined Newcastle in a Â£60m move from La Liga club Real Sociedad in 2022.

Sources have told BBC Sport he is using the Spanish club's training ground facilities, but is not training with the team.

It is understood he asked to use the facilities and the club were happy to let him do so outside of first team training hours.

Newcastle have declined to comment.

Magpies head coach Eddie Howe said earlier this week the club are yet to receive a bid from any club for the striker. 

"[Isak] is still our player. He's contracted to us," he added.

"We, to a degree, control what is next for him. I would love to believe all possibilities are still available to us. My wish is that he stays, but that's not in my full control.

"We have not received a formal offer for Alex, from any club."

Isak scored 27 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions for Newcastle last season.

Howe's side lost their third match of pre-season on Wednesday with a 1-0 defeat by a K-League XI.

They face fellow Premier League outfit Tottenham at Seoul World Cup Stadium on Sunday.

How can Liverpool afford Isak after spending so much?

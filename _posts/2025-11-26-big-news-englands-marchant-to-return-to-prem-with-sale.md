According to new developments, Joe Marchant swapped Harlequins for Stade Francais before the 2023-24 season 

Sale Sharks have signed Joe Marchant on a long-term contract from the start of next season.

The centre will return to England once he concludes the campaign with Top 14 side Stade Francais.

Marchant, 29, has been with the Paris-based club for the past two years and has played more than 50 games for them.

He has won 26 caps for England, the last of which came at the World Cup in 2023, but he has not been eligible to play for his country while based in France.

Before his move to Paris, Marchant had spent all his career at Harlequins where he played more than 150 matches and was part of the side that won the Prem title in 2021.

He was first picked for England in 2019 and he can try to win more caps from next season onwards.

"There are a lot of lads at the club who I've played and trained with for England and it'll be great to play with them again," Marchant told the Sale website, external.

"Sale have some of the best players in the country and I can't wait to play with them.

"I'd love to get back in the mix for England but I know that first I have to get back into the flow of the Prem and put in some good performances for Sale."

For the arrival of Marchant, Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson believes that it is a deal which suits both parties.

"Joe has got aspirations to play in the World Cup and that is part of his motivation for coming back," said Sanderson.

"To do that, he needs to play in a championship-competing team and he believes that's us.

"He's got X-factor, both sides of the ball and in the air. He's some player."

'Tough chance' - Jadeja dropped by Bashir for a caught and bowled dismissal

England spinner Shoaib Bashir has been ruled out of the remainder of the Test series against India with a broken finger on his left hand.

Bashir, 21, was injured attempting a catch off his own bowling on day three of England's win in the third Test at Lord's.

After sitting out much of the remainder of the Test, Bashir returned to bowl on the fifth day despite the issue and took the final wicket as England secured a dramatic 22-run victory.

"It's not good news for Bash," said England captain Ben Stokes. "It's very disappointing for us as a team and for him."

England say he will undergo surgery later this week.

Bashir also walked out to bat on day four as England sought to set a defendable total, making a nine-ball two as his side's last batter.

"He's 21 years old, he's got a very badly broken finger," Stokes told BBC Test Match Special.

"To even walk out there and bat. He didn't even ask, he got his pads on, and got his finger strapped up.

"Every time I looked down at the bench, I could see his face peering saying, 'Get me on'.

"To finish that game off was written in the stars."

The injury forces England's hand for the remaining two Tests in terms of Bashir's place.

Despite being repeatedly backed by his captain and coach Brendon McCullum, Bashir has come into question given his 10 wickets have cost 541 runs at an average of 54.10.

Bashir has played in all of England's Tests since the fourth match of their tour of India in February 2024. 

That has come despite him not being the first-choice spinner at his county, Somerset, and having to go out on loan.

Left-arm spinner Jack Leach, who has played 39 Tests, is preferred by Somerset and is still centrally contracted to England. 

He played alongside Bashir in Pakistan last autumn and went on the tour of New Zealand before Christmas.

Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed was also on that tour. He and his 17-year-old brother Farhan, who is an off-spinner, played for England Lions against India A earlier this summer.

Left-armer Liam Dawson, the leading spinner in the County Championship in recent years, was recalled to England's T20 side earlier this year.

Another option would be to bring in batting all-rounder Jacob Bethell, who bowls left-arm spin, therefore strengthening the batting, although McCullum appeared to rule that out prior to Bashir's injury.

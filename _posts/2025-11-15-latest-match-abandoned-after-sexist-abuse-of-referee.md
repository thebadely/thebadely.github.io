Here’s what you need to know: A non-league match was abandoned after sexist abuse was allegedly aimed at a female referee, a football club has said.

AFC Rushden & Diamonds said its match at Coventry Sphinx was called off at half-time after a comment from the crowd of a "sexist nature" was heard being directed at her.

The Northamptonshire side said it was "deeply concerned and disappointed".

A spokesperson said it would "take the strongest possible action" if it established the person responsible was associated with the club.

"A comment of a sexist nature was allegedly directed toward the female match official towards the end of the first half," said an AFC Rushden & Diamonds spokesperson, in a statement posted on X.

"Discriminatory language or actions of any kind have absolutely no place within our community club or the wider football community."

Attempts to identify the individual were unsuccessful and the matter had been reported to the "relevant authorities", the club said.

The BBC has contacted the Football Association and Coventry Sphinx for comment.

Speaking to the club's in-house media after the match, Diamonds first team manager Elliot Sandy said the referee stopped the match while the culprit was removed from the ground.

He said the match resumed, but that at half-time, she told the team she did not feel comfortable continuing.

"I obviously condemn what's happened today; there's no place for it in football and I feel really sorry for her that it has actually happened," said Sandy.

The two sides both play in the Northern Premier League Midlands Division.

Diamonds said any supporters who witnessed the incident or who had information should contact them.

According to new developments, Jos Buttler's Gujarat Titans and Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bengaluru are two of the teams in contention 

The race to qualify for the play-off stage of the Indian Premier League is on.

Seven teams can still finish in the top four with only three points separating the top five.

Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings are all out of contention. Here's what the rest need to qualify...

Each team plays 14 matches in the IPL group stage with the top four reaching the play-offs. Each win is worth two points.

Buttler bounces back in the IPL

Gujarat Titans

Position: First Played: 11 Points: 16 Maximum points: 22

Remaining fixtures: Delhi Capitals (a), Lucknow Super Giants (h), Chennai Super Kings (h) 

Following victory over Mumbai, one win from their final three games will secure the Titans a play-off spot given four other teams can no longer all get to 18 points.

Three wins would mean a top-two finish for Jos Buttler and the Titans - thus avoiding the eliminator and having two chances to reach the final. Two wins may also be enough given their strong net run-rate.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru

Position: Second Played: 11 Points: 16 Maximum points: 22

Remaining fixtures: Lucknow Super Giants (a), Sunrisers Hyderabad (h), Kolkata Knight Riders (h)

Gujarat's win in Mumbai also means RCB only need one win in their remaining three games to guarantee progression. 

Punjab Kings

Position: Third Played: 11 Points: 15 Maximum points: 21 

Remaining fixtures: Delhi Capitals (h), Mumbai Indians (h), Rajasthan Royals (a)

Two wins from their remaining three games will also guarantee Punjab Kings make it to the play-offs.

One win could be enough but it will rely on other results going their way. 

Mumbai Indians

Position: Fourth Played: 12 Points: 14 Maximum points: 18

Remaining fixtures: Punjab Kings (a), Delhi Capitals (h)

Mumbai Indians are in a strong position, given they have the best net run-rate of all of the teams this year.

They need two wins to be certain of going through but one could be enough if other results go their way. 

Two defeats would knock them out.

Delhi Capitals

Position: Fifth Played: 11 Points: 13 Maximum points: 19

Remaining fixtures: Punjab Kings (a), Gujarat Titans (h), Mumbai Indians (a)

Delhi Capitals were boosted by taking a point from their washout against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday - a game in which they were facing defeat at 29-5.

It means three wins would send them through, while two would likely have them right in the mix.

Delhi's remaining matches are all against sides above them, however.

Kolkata Knight Riders

Position: Sixth Played: 12 Points: 11 Maximum points: 15

Remaining fixtures: Sunrisers Hyderabad (a), Royal Challengers Bengaluru (a)

KKR were champions in 2024 but their fate is out of their hands this year. Their hopes were also severely dented by defeat by Chennai Super Kings on Wednesday.

KKR now need to win their two remaining matches and hope a series of results go their way.

Lucknow Super Giants

Position: Seventh Played: 11 Points: 10 Maximum points: 16

Remaining fixtures: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (h), Gujarat Titans (a), Sunrisers Hyderabad (h)

Lucknow were third in the standings after six matches but now have only the slimmest of chances of progressing.

They can only get to 16 points so are reliant on other results and have the worst net run-rate of all of the teams still in contention.

Another defeat will knock them out.

Five-time champions Chennai Super Kings, last year's runner-up Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals have all been eliminated.

The opening match in the play-offs is between the teams that finished first and second in the league phase. The winner goes straight into the final on Sunday, 25 May.

The third and fourth-placed teams then meet in the eliminator. 

The loser is knocked out while the winner plays the side that lost the first play-off match for the chance to compete in the final.

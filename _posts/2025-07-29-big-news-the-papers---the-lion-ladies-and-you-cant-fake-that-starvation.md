Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Guardian leads with Donald Trump's calls - after meeting Sir Keir Starmer - for Israel to let more aid into Gaza to tackle what he acknowledged was "real starvation".

The Daily Mirror says the prime minister "guided Mr Trump onto a more human path".

But other papers concentrate on different comments from the US president.

"Cut tax to beat Farage," is how the Times sums up his advice to the prime minister. 

"Cut taxes and stop the boats," is the Daily Telegraph's take.

The Daily Express says it is "pretty simple" but the one problem, says the Daily Mail, is that "the Labour leader is a world expert in doing the exact opposite".

The Financial Times says European markets have reeled after the big nations - France and Germany - cast doubt on the EU's trade deal with Washington.

The Times says initial relief at the announcement gave way to fears that the 15% tariff rate would cost businesses across the EU dearly.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says the deal is the EU's greatest humiliation since Britain voted to leave.

The Guardian says that as the five-day strike by resident doctors is nearing its end, NHS bosses and the doctors' union are in a war of words over patients' safety.

The Times highlights the warning that the British Medical Association is risking lives by refusing to let striking doctors work.

The Sun wonders whether giving militant doctors a 22% pay rise last year might turn out to be the government's worst mistake of its first year in power. 

"Didn't it dawn on ministers that all it would achieve would be another absurd pay claim from the Marxist BMA this year?" the paper asks.

England's Euro-winning footballers remain on many of the front pages as they visited Downing Street for a reception to celebrate their victory over Spain. 

The Sun headlines its coverage "The Lion Ladies".

The Times says the next goal for the Lionesses is more honours to go with the MBEs or OBEs some received after their Euro title in 2022.

The Daily Star is also calling for the manager and players to receive official recognition, headlining its story "The Beautiful Dame".

In its editorial, the Guardian says the Lionesses have lit up an English summer, forging legends that will fire the imaginations of future generations of girls.

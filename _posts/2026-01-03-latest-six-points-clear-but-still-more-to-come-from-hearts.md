According to new developments, Hearts are six points clear after beating Livingston

Potentially the best part for Hearts as they beat Livingston to move six points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership, is the fact manager Derek McInnes feels there is "more to come".

After dominating Livingston in the first half while only managing a solitary goal from Craig Halkett, they struggled at times in the second period at a nervy Tynecastle.

Nonetheless they came through with a vital three points to put daylight between them and Celtic and Rangers, who have claimed the title between them for 40 years.

Things have been good, but McInnes has laid down the challenge to his players to improve on their 12 wins and two defeats in the first half of the season.

"I've said there is more to come from us," the Hearts head coach told BBC Scotland. 

"Our fight is with ourselves and we're not getting caught up in what others are doing or saying.

"Whether they think we're capable or not. We are quietly confident we are good enough to win games. But today is another example that every game is hard fought.

"We had 12 wins and two defeats from the first 19 games and we have spoken long and hard about the need to improve on that."

One of the reasons McInnes is confident is the fact Hearts have been very efficient in the winter transfer market.

Right-back has been a problem position for years, and the early signing of Dutchman Jordi Altena from Waalwijk meant he could be pitched in for his debut in the first game of 2026.

His wonderful cross from deep set up Halkett for the winner, and he created another two chances in a promising attacking display.

It is only one game, but a natural right-back who can occupy that side has immediately given Hearts more balance.

"It was a lovely cross for Halkett," added McInnes. "He had some good moments and we tried to play him higher on that side and get switches of play and he held his position really well.

"It's not easy coming in but he's savoured Tynecastle and is part of a winning performance, which serves him well. And hopefully there's more to come from him as well."

Kazakh winger Islam Chesnokov has finally arrived in Edinburgh after a very drawn-out transfer saga and will also feature on the right.

The 26-year-old has hit double figures for goals in his past two seasons in his homeland and, given the hit rate of Tony Bloom's Jamestown Analytics, could make an instant impact.

There are also rumours of a new striker, while Pierre Landry Kabore is still to return from international duty, and there is improvement to be made from players already at the club.

As McInnes said, Hearts' composure was poorer in the second half against Livingston.

"In the first half we looked like a team who deserved to be top of the league," McInnes told BBC Scotland. 

"Some of our play was brilliant and free flowing. 

"But it's a reminder to the players that there's a consequence for every rushed pass when you're in transition, every missed chance and every time you don't get the second goal.

"We never looked settled in the second half. We still had some moments but looked a bit rushed. But in fairness to the players there may be something in their head from the Kilmarnock game. 'Is one enough?' Sometimes one is enough.

"I'd have liked to enjoy the second half a bit more. But in professional football the enjoyment comes from winning.

"We all wake up in the morning, look at the league table and say job well done, and credit to the players for that."

McInnes is right. The grit and determination to see out the game was enough.

Goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow produced three good saves to deny Tete Yengi having been a spectator for much of the second half and they toughed it out.

Michael Stewart brought into focus the difference between his old side and Celtic on BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.

"Hearts are outstanding in the first half and should have been 4-0 up," he said. 

"Nervous in the second half, but they see it out. They defend their box, throw bodies in the way, the goalkeeper comes up with big saves. 

"Celtic capitulate as soon as there's a bit of pressure on them in the second half [against Rangers].

"They have no character, no identity, they're all over the shop. The polar opposite of what Hearts are."

Bottom-half sides Dundee and St Mirren are Hearts' next two league games before Celtic visit Tynecastle, and given the tumult at Parkhead it is an opportunity for McInnes and his squad to really turn the screw in the title race.

Rangers are slowly building momentum under Danny Rohl, but given Hearts have also beaten them twice this season there will be no fear of the Ibrox side.

Pressure will only increase with every game, but right now Hearts feel the best is yet to come.

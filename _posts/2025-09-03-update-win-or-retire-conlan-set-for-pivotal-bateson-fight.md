Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Michael Conlan returned from a 16-month hiatus with a points win against Asad Asif Khan in Brighton in March

WBC international featherweight title: Michael Conlan v Jack Bateson

Venue: 3Arena, Dublin Date: Friday, 5 September Ring walk: 22:00 BST (approx.)

Coverage: Follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website from 21:30 BST

Michael Conlan is employing a "what will be, will be" approach to the remainder of his career but says he is in a "good place" as he prepares to take on England's Jack Bateson in Dublin on Friday.

The Belfast featherweight began his professional career with dreams of becoming a multi-weight world champion, but he has yet to scale the mountain with two previous title attempts falling short.

The brashness of youth is now giving way to a more measured approach, with Conlan seemingly content with whatever may come his way.

"I'm at peace with everything and for whatever happens on Friday night," the 33-year-old told BBC Sport NI.

"What will be, will be. If I were to lose, then that's it [career] done, but if I win then I'm moving on towards a world title. I've got to give everything I can and I'm willing to do that.

"You hear me now say things like 'it's the last chance saloon' and 'if I don't win a world title then so be it, but if I do then fantastic'.

"These are things I've come to terms with, but if you have the opportunity, then take it with both hands."

Conlan has appeared on huge cards around the world and headlined his own shows in Belfast, but he will tick another box on Friday by fighting in Dublin as a professional for the first time.

His last outing was in Brighton in March, when fighting for the first time since his December 2023 defeat to Jordan Gill as he returned with a points victory against Asad Asif Khan.

The March contest was his first bout under the tutelage of Grant Smith and the relationship between fighter and head coach has strengthened since.

"He is a fantastic coach and a great man away from boxing," Conlan said.

"He's tweaked the things that needed tweaked. My defence is much better and you could probably see evidence of that in the last fight.

"That was only after a couple of months together, so the fact we've had nearly a year now is great and it feels like I'm improving again."

Jack Bateson's sole career defeat came against Shabaz Masoud in 2022

Victory is imperative if Belfast man Conlan wants to keep his career on track - preferably in style to silence the doubters and put the rest of the division on notice that he remains a force.

It may be Conlan's show, but 31-year-old Leeds fighter Bateson - whose record stands at 20-1-1 and who is coming off a draw with Danny Quartermaine - will know the door is ajar for his own huge opportunities should he silence the home crowd.

"I've got to win and put a performance on," Conlan said.

"I don't put pressure on myself to do that, but it's what I expect from myself. This is one of those times when I know it's going to happen with the work put in and how I've been performing in training camp.

"I'm in a good place. I'm expecting the best Jack Bateson as it's probably the last chance for him as well. If he beats me there are plenty of opportunities to come and that's his motivation.

"I've got to do my job and stop him from doing his."

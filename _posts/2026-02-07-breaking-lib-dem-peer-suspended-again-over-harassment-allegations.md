Experts revealed that Lord Rennard has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats after the party launched a fresh investigation into claims he sexually harassed female members. 

A Lib Dem spokesperson said the party "has now received legal advice" that a 2013 inquiry into the allegations "was flawed in several respects".

Harassment claims were made against the peer in 2013, but in 2014 a barrister appointed by the party to investigate the allegations concluded that whilst the accounts of the four women were "broadly credible," they could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

In a statement, Lord Rennard referred to the Met Police investigation and several independent reviews, which he said concluded "no further action" needed to be taken.

Lord Rennard has previously apologised if he had "inadvertently encroached" upon "personal space".

The Lib Dem spokesperson added party leader Sir Ed Davey believes "Rennard should not be a member of the House of Lords" and "that it should be made easier for peers to be expelled from the Lords for serious misconduct". 

In 2013, Lord Rennard, a former party chief executive, was accused by four women of abusing his position for years by inappropriately touching and propositioning them. 

The party's internal inquiry found that there should be no further action against Lord Rennard but requested he apologised. He initially refused but later expressed regret.

The Metropolitan Police also found there was "insufficient evidence" to prosecute the peer over allegations of sexual touching

Lord Rennard subsequently challenged his suspension from the Lib Dems, saying it was against party rules. It was eventually lifted after disciplinary proceedings against him were dropped and the party said this brought "the matter to a close".

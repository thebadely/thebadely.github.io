All kick-off times GMT, Conference seed in brackets

Saturday, 10 January

Los Angeles Rams (5) @ Carolina Panthers (4) - 21:30

This is a rematch from week 13, but I don't think it's fair to look at that 31-28 win for the Panthers. They managed to stay alive in the play-off hunt but their defence has kind of been the reason they've stayed in most of their games, rather than their quarterback Bryce Young.

The Rams are one of the Super Bowl favourites and I think their defence is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Carolina.

Matt Stafford is one of the leading MVP contenders and Puka Nacua leads the league for receptions. He's just so physical in taking contested catches. His one-handed catches are incredible.

The Rams have struggled in the red zone in recent weeks without Davante Adams but he's set to come back so, for me, it's a clear Rams win.

Green Bay Packers (7) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 01:00 Sun

This is going to be awesome. They're divisional rivals and it's the NFL's oldest rivalry, so there's so much familiarity. That's what makes it so exciting.

They've played each other twice in the last five weeks and they're 1-1. The Packers almost beat the Bears in week 16, and that was after Micah Parsons' injury and being without Jordan Love for most of the game (concussion).

Caleb Williams is doing such a great job with his game management, his athleticism, the way the ball just jumps out of his hand, and his receivers are coming together, so I have the Bears on this one.

They have had the most fourth-quarter comebacks in a season (six) and their defence leads the league with 33 takeaways. They'll probably need to get a couple more against Jordan Love to really seal the deal.

Are the Jacksonville Jaguars are a legitimate Super Bowl contender?

Sunday, 11 January

Buffalo Bills (6) @ Jacksonville Jaguars (3) - 18:00

With Kansas City, Cincinnati and Baltimore not in the play-offs, this is the clearest route to the Super Bowl the Bills have had, but this is a scary Jags team.

They've won their last eight, so they're the team that has momentum. They're having fun out there, and we've never seen this version of Trevor Lawrence before, the way he's finishing in the red zone. He looks so confident.

The Jags have been clicking on all three phases since their bye week. They brought in Jakobi Myers and the Bills have to stop Travis Etienne running all over them.

But I still have so much faith in Josh Allen. We've seen it so many times, where he comes to life in the fourth quarter, and it's hard to bet against him. So I'm going for my Bills, especially because I'll be working at the game â and I can't stand the thought of them losing!

NFL play-offs: 2025 season

10 January - 8 February 2026

Live text commentary on all play-off games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio coverage of 49ers at Eagles on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, will also follow the road to Super Bowl 60

San Francisco 49ers (6) @ Philadelphia Eagles (3) - 21:30

Given their injuries, coach Kyle Shanahan has been incredible to get the 49ers where they are. They have done a great job of staying afloat with their defence, but I just don't know how sustainable it is.

Having slipped from potentially the top seed to the sixth, Shanahan's been like 'we've just got to do it the hard way'. This must mean so much to them because of the 2023 NFC Championship game in Philly, when Brock Purdy got injured and Christian McCaffrey had to play quarterback.

I don't think the Eagles are going to do anything fancy. They're going to run the ball, get the play-action to throw outside to their receivers and then play great defence.

It's not cute, it's not exciting, but they just know how to win. I have a lot of faith in Jalen Hurts and their defence, so I'm going Eagles.

Los Angeles Chargers (7) @ New England Patriots (2) - 01:00 Mon

Playing at New England is tough in the cold and I think that makes a big difference. I don't know how much further the Patriots will go, but I think they'll win this.

Justin Herbert's been hit so many times. The Chargers' offensive line has just not been able to protect him. Like the Bills, their receivers haven't been able to get separation. It's like Herbert's the magic man again, whereas at least the Patriots have some receivers, and Drake Maye has been phenomenal.

I think he's earned the MVP because it's a great story. He's with a franchise that's not been itself since Tom Brady left and it's unbelievable what he's done in his second year.

You can only say their schedule has been easy so many times. You still have to beat the teams in front of you, and he's been decisive, he's stepping up in the pocket and the way he throws the ball is beautiful.

Houston Texans (5) @ Pittsburgh Steelers (4) - 01:00 Tue

The Steelers' win on Sunday was wild, but I think we have the same conversation around them every year. Mike Tomlin's done a great job, they've got a winning record again and got to the play-offs, but for so long it's not been more than that.

I'm going for the Texans because of their defence, it's just ferocious. Danielle Hunter has 15 sacks, Will Anderson is second in the NFL with a career-high 85 QB pressures, and they have four players with four interceptions. That's a crazy stat - which of their defensive backs do you throw towards?

Aaron Rodgers is doing tons trying to get the Steelers' offence on the same page but they're still having miscues. DK Metcalf is back from suspension but I just don't see them having enough firepower to compete with this defence.

It's the main reason the Texans could make it deep into the play-offs. They can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.

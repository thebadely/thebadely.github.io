It has been recently reported that The first tournament at the Queen's Club in West Kensington took place in 1889

British number one Jack Draper and world number six Jessica Pegula will play at Queen's next year.

Draper, ranked 10th in the world, reached the semi-finals this summer where he lost in three sets to eventual runner-up Jiri Lehecka.

American Pegula will make her tournament debut in 2026, a year after women's tennis returned to Queen's for the first time since 1973.

Last week it was confirmed defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz and 2025 women's runner-up Amanda Anisimova will return.

"I'm really looking forward to being back â I played some really good tennis this year and it's one of my favourite tournaments, being in front of a home crowd, I just love the atmosphere," said Draper, 23.

"I've got a picture of me next to the trophy when I'm a kid and I'm just about taller than the trophy so hopefully one day I'll get to lift it up. 

"Queen's is one of the tournaments I want to win the most because it's my home tournament, a beautiful place and making the semi-finals this year, I just came up short, so next year I'll be really motivated to come back and go a couple of steps further."

Pegula, 31, said: "I've heard great things from other players about the set-up, the atmosphere, and the history there, so it'll be fun to experience it for myself."

The women's tournament takes place from 6-14 June, with the men's held from 13-21 June.

Experts revealed that Celtic say Sebastian Tounekti is a "quick, clever winger"

Celtic have bought Sebastian Tounekti from Hammarby for an undisclosed fee, with manager Brendan Rodgers expecting the winger to "make a big difference".

The Norway born 23-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract with the Scottish champions, has played twice for his adopted country.

Tounekti only joined the Swedish top-flight club in February from Norwegian outfit Haugesund and leaves with Hammarby sitting second in the Allsvenskan after 22 games.

Rodgers told his club website "he will be a really exciting addition" to his squad.

"He will give us that real added attacking intent and I am sure he can make a big difference to us," he said.

"He is a quick, clever winger who can operate on both sides, creating opportunities for himself and others. Myself and our coaches are really looking forward to working with Sebastian."

Tounekti started his career with Norwegian side Tromsdalen before moving to BodÃ¸/Glimt, from whom he was sent on loan to Groningen.

He also spent time on loan to Ranheim from after joining Haugesund in 2022.

Tounekti made 23 appearances for Hammarby, all but one of them starts, scoring three goals.

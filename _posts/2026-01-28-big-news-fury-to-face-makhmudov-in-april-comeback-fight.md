Here’s what you need to know: Tyson Fury made his professional debut in 2008

Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury will face Arslanbek Makhmudov in the UK on 11 April as he ends his latest spell of retirement.

The fight, which will be broadcast on Netflix, will be Fury's first since he lost his rematch with unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in December 2024.

The Briton, 37, retired a month after that defeat but announced his return to boxing earlier this month.

"Excited to be back," Fury said.

"Heart's always been and always will be in boxing. Someone go tell the king that the ace is back!"

Russian Makhmudov, 36, has won 21 of his 23 fights and beat Briton Dave Allen in his last bout in October.

Fury, who announced his retirement for the first time in 2022, has not fought in the UK since December 2022 when he beat Derek Chisora at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to retain the WBC title.

The Morecambe fighter has 34 victories from 37 fights - winning 24 by knockout - losing two and drawing one.

He has enjoyed two stints as world champion, beating Wladimir Klitschko to win the WBA (Super), IBF and WBO belts in 2015 and claiming the WBC title in 2020 with victory over Deontay Wilder, but has never reigned as undisputed champion.

Fury's two career defeats came in successive bouts against Usyk in 2024 and he has spoken of a desire to avenge those losses this year.

The biggest surprise isn't Fury coming back - we've almost lost count of how many times he's retired and returned - but that it's landing on Netflix, with a global subscriber base of 325 million people.

It underlines Fury's status as one of boxing's few genuine crossover stars. Love him or loathe him, Fury is box office, a fighter who attracts attention well beyond the sport.

It is also striking given Fury is promoted by Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions, who broadcast exclusively with Dazn. Yet Warren has allowed the Gypsy King to step outside that arrangement on this occasion.

"Tyson wants to return to the throne and I'm 100% behind him to do just that," Warren posted on X.

This marks Fury's first bout in the UK since December 2022, after three straight appearances in Saudi Arabia.

The number of shows taking place in Riyadh may be dwindling but the money and influence behind the sport remain Saudi-led. The fight is backed by Turki Alalshikh - chairman of Saudi's General Sports Authority - under the Ring Magazine banner.

Fans wanted a bigger-name opponent. Makhmudov is a dangerous, imposing threat, and Fury can't afford complacency, but anything close to his Usyk performances should be enough for a comfortable win.

So what next, should he come through? The pursuit of the long-awaited Anthony Joshua fight, which was expected to happen in 2026, has understandably cooled after Joshua's tragic car crash in December.

Until Joshua's next steps are clearer, Fury's focus is back on world titles, with early talk of a possible move towards WBO champion Fabio Wardley later this year.

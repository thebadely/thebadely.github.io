According to new developments, Around 40 people have died and 115 people are injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, police say.

Authorities said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. 

It is being treated as a fire and there is "no question" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.

Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin has called it "one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced". 

A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117

Here's what we know so far. 

At a news conference on Thursday afternoon police said around 40 people were killed in the fire and 115 people were injured, many severely. 

The injured have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland. A burns unit in Milan in neighbouring Italy has also been made available. 

The director of Lausanne University Hospital told a Swiss newspaper that 22 patients had been transferred to her centre's care so far, mostly aged 16-26. 

Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's chief-prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said.

But the Italian ambassador to Switzerland warned it could take weeks to identify the dead. Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. 

People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian Foreign Ministry has told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others are receiving treatment in hospital.  

Three Italian nationals - a woman in her twenties and two boys under 16 - were being taken to Milan to be treated at Niguarda hospital's major burns unit, local councillor Guido Bertolaso said.

The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.

French media earlier reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals.

French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players was "severely burned" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, has been airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, the club said in a statement.

President Emmanuel Macron said France was "ready to provide any assistance" and that people injured in the fire were welcome to be treated in French hospitals. 

The EU is also providing medical assistance to the victims, the bloc's President Ursula von der Leyen said.

The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. 

Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.

The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.

Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it "is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises".

Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. 

"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood." Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.

They described the evacuation as "very difficult" because the escape route was "narrow" and the stairs to get outside "even narrower". 

In a news conference on Thursday, Ms Pilloud also said the staircases appeared to be narrow, but investigations will assess whether they were in line with requirements.

The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. 

The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. 

Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. 

Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.

Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. 

It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. 

The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. 

A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation bar,  published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.

The caption, written in French, read: "The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption."

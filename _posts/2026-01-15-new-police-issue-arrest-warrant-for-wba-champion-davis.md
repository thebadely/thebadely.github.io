It has been recently reported that Gervonta Davis has held the WBA lightweight title since 2023

Police in Miami have issued an arrest warrant for WBA lightweight champion Gervonta Davis in connection with an alleged domestic violence incident.

The warrant has been issued against Davis on charges of false imprisonment, battery and attempted kidnapping, relating to an incident in October.

Miami Gardens Police held a news conference on Wednesday which revealed officers were working with the US Marshals Fugitive Task Force to find Davis.

"As a result of the diligent and hard work of our special victims unit, an arrest warrant has been issued for Gervonta Bryant Davis on the following charges â battery, false imprisonment and attempted kidnapping," police said in a statement.

"The investigation determines that Mr Davis used force to restrain and attempt to remove the victim from the location against her will. 

"The Miami Gardens Police Department is actively working with the United States Marshals Fugitive task force to locate and apprehend Mr Davis."

Police in Miami say Davis allegedly "grabbed" the victim "by the back of her hair with one hand and by her throat with the other", before "forcefully" trying to move her.

"The victim reported they were previously involved in an intimate relationship for approximately five months," the statement continued.

"Lead detective Gary Florencio obtained and viewed video surveillance footage that cooperates key elements of the victim's statement."

The arrest warrant for the 31-year-old American comes after a civil lawsuit was filed against him by ex-girlfriend Courtney Rossel in October.

The lawsuit accused Davis of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Rossel is also seeking compensatory and punitive damages "of over $50,000" (Â£38,145), and requested a jury trial.

Davis was set to fight YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in an exhibition bout in Miami on 14 November but was pulled from the bout after the lawsuit was filed.

The arrest warrant for Davis comes six months after a domestic violence case against Davis was dropped by another ex-girlfriend.

He was also previously arrested on battery domestic violence charges in February 2020 and December 2022.

Davis served 44 days in jail in 2023 after violating the terms of a 90-day house arrest sentence, in relation to a criminal hit-and-run case that occurred in his home city of Baltimore in November 2020.

Here’s what you need to know: Lando Norris won the sprint race in Miami in May

McLaren's Lando Norris said taking pole position for Saturday's sprint race was a "good start" to his Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend.

The Briton said he was "confident" in dry conditions, but the sprint - which is due to start at 14:00 GMT, 11:00 in Sao Paulo - could be affected by an expected overnight storm.

"We have to prepare for both conditions," said Norris, who starts two places ahead of team-mate and title rival Oscar Piastri.

"I expect the morning to be heavy rain and incredibly windy. Let's wait and see what happens."

Norris, who heads Piastri by one point in the championship after winning the Mexico City Grand Prix two weeks ago, beat Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli by 0.097 seconds in sprint qualifying, while Piastri was 0.185secs adrift of the Briton in third.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen, the only other realistic title contender at 36 points behind Norris, could manage only sixth, beaten by Mercedes' George Russell and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso.

Norris added: "Car has been performing well. Not nice enough that I'm happy about everything. Some things to improve on for qualifying. Sprint race, if I can cruise to victory that would be beautiful."

Lewis Hamilton was knocked out in the second session and qualified 11th in his Ferrari, his final lap in the second session ruined when team-mate Charles Leclerc spun in front of him out of Turn 10.

Hamilton also faced an investigation for failing to slow sufficiently for the yellow flags waved when Leclerc lost control but was let off with a reprimand, because of the short time a yellow signal was visible to him and the fact he had hesitated before applying the throttle.

Norris' result is the best possible start to the weekend and gives him the opportunity to build his championship lead - eight points are awarded to the winner of the sprint, seven for second and so on down to eighth place.

Norris topped two of the three sessions in sprint qualifying and had a comfortable advantage over Piastri throughout.

He said: "It was a little bit tougher than I would have liked. But we did the job we needed to do, which was to be fastest today.

"Qualifying is always one of the best things here. It's difficulty, it's bumpy, it's tricky, always a joy, always puts a smile on your face.

"But a long weekend, another qualifying and another couple of races to go but a good start."

Piastri, who comes to Brazil off the back of two difficult races in the US and Mexico, said: "A couple of big moments on my first lap, which wasn't ideal.

"That was a shame. But ultimately I felt much happier than the last couple of weeks. We can definitely fight with what we've got and there are a lot more points on Sunday."

Qualifying for the grand prix is due to follow the sprint at 18:00 GMT, although the weather forecast means the schedule could well be affected.

Verstappen complained over the radio to the team that his car was "undriveable".

He added: "A lot of vibration in the car, a lot of ride problems. Not what we want. But besides that we also don't have the grip, just can't get the car to turn but at the same time can't really rely on the rear.

"For us, quite poor, I would say. It is quite clear we are lacking something. I am not expecting that to be much better in the wet. But we'll see tomorrow."

Antonelli impressed in second, his best time set on his first lap, while the surprise package of qualifying was Alonso, who set fastest time in the second session and was just 0.253secs off pole in his midfield car in the final shootout.

Alonso said: "Car felt good in P1. We were P4. Now we are P5 so it seems like we started the weekend in the window of the operation of the car, and then with only one free practice if you start with the right foot, everything becomes easier."

His team-mate Lance Stroll was seventh fastest, ahead of Leclerc, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg.

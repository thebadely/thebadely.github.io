Experts revealed that Burton has scored two tries in her four Test appearances for England

England and Trailfinders Women back row Abi Burton has been chosen as chair of a landmark leadership group of PWR players.

Burton, who was part of the Red Roses squad that won the Womens' Rugby World Cup in September, will lead the Women's Rugby Board set up by elite players union The Rugby Players Association (RPA).

The 25-year-old's Rugby World Cup triumph came three years after she had to be placed in a coma to treat a serious immune disease attacking her brain.

"I'm really proud to have been elected chair of the first Women's Rugby Board," said Burton.

"It's an important opportunity to ensure players' voices are heard, and I'm looking forward to working with the board and the RPA to represent players across the women's game."

The new separate women's board will ensure women's players are better represented and able to respond to "specific challenges and opportunities they face" say the RPA.

Bristol Bears and Wales full-back Jenny Hesketh has been elected as vice-chair with Emily Tuttosi, who started for Canada against England in last year's World Cup final, chosen as Exeter Chiefs representative.

Let's dive into the details: Keegan Bradley has featured in three Ryder Cups as player or captain but is yet to win it

Keegan Bradley fears he will "never get over" the USA's Ryder Cup defeat by Europe after enduring "one of the toughest times" of his life since the loss in New York.

The 39-year-old captained Team USA at Bethpage in September, overseeing a disastrous campaign as Europe secured a 15-13 victory.

Bradley's appointment made him the youngest captain of either side since Arnold Palmer in 1963.

But his pairings and course set-up were among the decisions questioned in the aftermath of the defeat, as Europe became the first team to win away since 2012. 

"Since Bethpage, this has been one of the toughest times in my life," said Bradley, in his first news conference since the event.

"You win, it's glory for a lifetime - but I didn't and I'm going to have to sit with this for the rest of my life.

"There's no part of me that thinks I'll ever get over this. This event has been so brutal to me. I'll forever wonder and wish."

How Europe held off US to win sensational Ryder Cup

Despite a dramatic final day comeback attempt, Team USA gave themselves too much to do after Europe established a 5Â½ to 2Â½ lead on the opening day. 

"You put so much into it, and you have all this planning, and the first two days went as poorly as we could have ever thought," Bradley said. 

Bradley had been expected to fulfil a player-captain role but had a "change of heart" earlier this year and opted against playing in New York. 

"The first practice day, I was out on the tee, and I was watching the guys walk down the fairway all together, and I said to myself 'I wish I was playing - that's what it's all about. I'm missing out'.'"

But Bradley says he made the right decision in omitting himself from selection because he was "physically exhausted" by the second day of the match. 

"I just didn't think I could do both jobs," he said. 

Bradley has now lost three Ryder Cups as a player and captain and, despite being unsure if he will get the chance again, says he will continue to make himself available for future editions. 

The next Ryder Cup takes place at Adare Manor in Ireland from September 17-19 2027.

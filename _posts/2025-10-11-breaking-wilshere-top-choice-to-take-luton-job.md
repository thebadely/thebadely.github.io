Experts revealed that Former England international Jack Wilshere won two FA Cups with Arsenal 

Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is the number one choice of the Luton Town board to take over as manager at Kenilworth Road.

The 33-year-old has held talks with the Hatters and is in pole position to replace Matt Bloomfield who was dismissed earlier this week.

Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens made it down to the final two but Wilshere is close to landing the job. A deal is yet to be finalised.

His last role was as interim coach at Norwich at the end of last season where he took over for the final two games following Johannes Hoff Thorup's sacking.

Wilshere was then overlooked for the permanent job, with the Canaries appointing Liam Manning, and was also linked to Plymouth Argyle before Tom Cleverley took charge. 

Luton, who have suffered back-to-back relegations, have experienced a poor start to the 2025-26 campaign with five defeats from their opening 11 games to leave them 11th in League One.

Wilshere was under-18 coach at Arsenal before joining Norwich and was a contender for the Gunners' Under-21 role in the summer before withdrawing. 

The former midfielder earned 34 caps for England and made 197 appearances for Arsenal, before spells at West Ham and Bournemouth.

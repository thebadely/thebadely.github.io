Experts revealed that Wales have lost just one of their 11 games under Craig Bellamy

There will be plenty of time for Wales to dissect a difficult night in Astana when they make their eight-hour flight home from Kazakhstan.

But when the ultimate destination is USA, Canada and Mexico next summer, the analysis was easy for former captain Ashley Williams.

As he put it: "For games like this all that matters is that you get the three points, get on the plane, get home."

The question is, though, how the win leaves Wales' chances of getting to the World Cup as they look ahead to their final three games of their Group J campaign?

After Kieffer Moore's goal was enough for an uncomfortable win in Kazakhstan, Wales top the group on 10 points, two points ahead of North Macedonia who have a game in hand.

But it's Belgium who are the ones to watch. Their 6-0 win over Liechtenstein in Vaduz leaves them three points behind Wales with two games in hand.

Whoever finishes top automatically qualifies for the finals, while the runners-up book a place in the 16-team play-offs for the remaining four spots.

A wait. 

Wales now have back-to-back friendly games - against Canada in Swansea on Tuesday (19:45 BST) and England at Wembley at the start of next month â before returning to qualifying action.

Belgium, on the other hand, have successive home games against Kazakhstan on Sunday and then North Macedonia on 10 October.

Win both and Kevin De Bruyne and co. would be three points ahead of Wales going into what is fast becoming a defining game on 13 October when Wales welcome Belgium to Cardiff City Stadium.

"It [Belgium] is the biggest game we have going forward, but we had to put ourselves in a position where it is an important game, so job done," summed up captain Ben Davies after the win in Astana.

After Belgium, Wales wrap up the campaign with a trip to Liechtenstein and a tricky final game with North Macedonia in Cardiff.

In terms of automatic qualification, Wales simply need to win. And win. And win.

The March draw in Skopje against North Macedonia and the dramatic June defeat in Brussels have taken away Wales' wriggle room. A loss against Belgium in Cardiff could realistically leave them trailing the Red Devils by six points with two games to go.

And one of those final fixtures for Belgium â after the long trip to Kazakhstan - is a home tie with group minnows Liechtenstein.

In that scenario, a point from either of those would be enough to deny Wales direct qualification.

Conversely, if Bellamy's side beat Belgium they could potentially go into their own final two fixtures level on points with the former world number one ranked side.

"If we can get three points off them and they have to come to a place like this and get three points with the pressure on," said former striker Nathan Blake in Astana.

"With a few injuries, you never know â but the Belgium game is gigantic for us."

It comes down to goal difference â and not head to head.

And Belgium are already two goals better off than Wales with two games in hand.

In other words â as well as beating Belgium at home â Wales realistically have to hope that Belgium also drop points elsewhere.

Especially when you consider their final home game is against Liechtenstein.

Optimistic Wales fans will point to Belgium's game with North Macedonia and the fact that Rudi Garcia's side could only manage a draw in Skopje.

After goal difference, goals scored is the next tie breaker before head-to-head results are taken into consideration.

A nervous few weeks for fans next March.

The format is the same used in recent years â and how Wales reached the last World Cup in Qatar.

Teams are placed into four paths and face a one-legged semi-final and a one-legged final; win both and you secure qualification.

With some groups having only just got under way, it is far too early to say which teams could potentially be lying in wait.

As former striker Sam Vokes reminded, North Macedonia will still have a say in this group and will be eyeing their trip to Cardiff in November as a chance to nick second spot.

If the worst happens, Wales are all but sure of having the chance to qualify for the play-offs as one of the Nations League group winners.

In the likely event of two of Spain, Germany, Portugal, France and England finishing either first or second in their group, Wales would get their play-off place.

It is a handy safety net, but it does come with a warning.

The play-offs are seeded with the Nations League entrants being automatically placed into pot four. In other words, should Wales finish third, they would face one of the highest ranked runners-up in the semi-final.

Put simply, it means Bellamy's side have every motivation going into their final three games.

And â as was suggested after full-time in Astana â all that matters from here on in is that they win.

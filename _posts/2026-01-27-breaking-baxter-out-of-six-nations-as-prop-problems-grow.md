Here’s what you need to know: Baxter made his debut away to New Zealand in July 2024 and started England's win over the All Blacks this autumn

England's prop problems continue to mount in the run-up to the Six Nations with Harlequins' Fin Baxter ruled out of the tournament.

The 23-year-old has featured in England's last 18 matches, but surgery on a foot injury has ended his hopes of continuing that run.

Baxter was named among five England players rehabilitating alongside the main 36-strong Six Nations squad on Friday.

With Ellis Genge backed up by Bevan Rodd and Emmanuel Iyogun on the loose-head side, there will be no replacement called up for Baxter.

However, Rodd has made only two appearances for England since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, while Iyogun is yet to win his first cap.

England take on Wales at home in their opening match of the tournament on 7 February.

Uncapped Sela called up for England Six Nations tilt

Rugby Union Weekly

England have already lost Will Stuart and Asher Opoku-Fordjour for the Six Nations leaving Vilikesa 'Billy' Sela and Trevor Davison, who have three caps between them, as understudies to Joe Heyes at tight-head.

Flanker Ben Curry, who was also set to travel to Girona to continue his recovery from injury, has been sent back to Sale to rehabilitate with Harlequins' Jack Kenningham called up to the squad.

Kenningham, who appeared for England in an uncapped match against a France XV in June, will add cover in an already well-stocked back row.

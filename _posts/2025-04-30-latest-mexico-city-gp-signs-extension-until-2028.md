Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Fans at last year's Mexico City Grand Prix 

Mexico City will stay on the Formula 1 calendar until at least 2028 after signing a new three-year contract.

The deal ends uncertainty over whether the race would continue after Mexican driver Sergio Perez lost his seat on the grid, having been dropped by Red Bull at the end of last season.

The race has been supported by the Mexican government, both national and local, and businesses.

Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a former mayor of the capital and a supporter of the race, along with the new mayor of Mexico City.

Billionaire businessman Carlos Slim Domit, one of the world's richest men, has also backed the GP.

The race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez has had one of the sport's most enthusiastic crowds since it returned to the calendar in 2015 after a 22-year absence.

Stefano Domenicali, F1 president and chief executive officer, said: "Every year the unique atmosphere created by our fans in Mexico City is one of the most incredible and energetic experiences of our championship.

"We look forward to continuing this extraordinary collaboration together and seeing the incredible enthusiasm of the Mexican fans again in October."

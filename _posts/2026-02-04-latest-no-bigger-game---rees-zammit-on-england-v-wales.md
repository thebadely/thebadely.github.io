It has been recently reported that Louis Rees-Zammit spent 18 months trying to break into American football

It is difficult to hide from the cameras when you are as box office as Louis Rees-Zammit, even when you are among 70,000 spectators. 

And sure enough, he was picked out among the Principality Stadium crowd when Wales suffered a 10-try drubbing by England during last year's Six Nations.

Rees-Zammit was chasing his NFL dream at the time, before returning to rugby union in the summer. 

"Obviously it wasn't a great watch, especially against England and losing in that manner," he said on Sarra Elgan's Six Nations 2026 Preview.

But this weekend, Bristol's flying full-back will have more of a say as he and his Wales team-mates prepare to take on the old enemy at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham.

It will actually be a first for Rees-Zammit, who at 25 has already played in three Six Nations, a World Cup and toured with the British and Irish Lions.

But he has never run out for Wales at Twickenham.

"We played Quins there for Bristol a couple of months back and that was unbelievable, the crowd was insane," he said.

"I'm looking forward to it, it's the first game as well. It's kind of the unknown with Wales â what have we done to bring a more consistent performance from the autumn to now?

"All of the boys are raring to go. There's no bigger game than Wales England."

It is fair to say Welsh fans are not carrying a great deal of hope into this year's Championship, especially after record defeats in the autumn.

You have to go all the way back to March 2023 to find Wales' most recent Six Nations success, in a match against Italy.

But with Steve Tandy leading Wales in the Six Nations for the first time, Rees-Zammit says this year feels like a fresh start.

"It's like a new team coming together. When you get new coaching staff and different ideas, it feels like everyone freshens up and starts from scratch," he said.

"In parts, we put in some good performances in the autumn, it's just about doing it consistently for a full 80 minutes."

Rees-Zammit also recognises with the 2027 World Cup fast approaching, Wales are playing catch-up with the other nations. 

"We've got to continue to work hard and try and accelerate this process as quick as possible," he said. 

"We've got some real quality in our team, you've just got to bring the best out of each and every player."

Rees-Zammit's pace and power have seen him flourish at full-back at Bristol, while Wales Tandy also sees "high potential" for him there.

"I love it. It allows me to get more touches on the ball in open field, it suits my game," Rees-Zammit said. 

"I much prefer it. I've played 15 in the past for Wales, but I think now I'm kind of seen as a 15 that can play on the wing. 

"It just brings something different and the way Bristol play is absolutely perfect for me.

"I've got the licence to not do what I want, but when I've got the ball back there I have to make a decision and back myself."

As a poster boy of world rugby, Rees-Zammit's return to the Six Nations is not only a boost for Wales, but for fans and media alike.

"I try to not focus on that," Rees-Zammit said.

"Everything that I've had off the field has come from my skills in rugby, and obviously going to America brought a new audience, but it's all about performance.

"You've got Henry Pollock going through the same thing, he's burst on to the scene and is playing unbelievably."

And while England's Pollock ruffles a few feathers, Rees-Zammit believes it is for the good of the game. 

"You've got to try and bring your personality out when it comes to rugby, because a lot of it gets shut down," he added. 

"Henry is doing a great job of bringing his personality to the game and we need more people like that, it'll just grow the sport.

"He obviously gets stick for it, and I got stick for it when I was younger, but you just go through it."

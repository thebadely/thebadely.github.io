According to new developments, Blair Kinghorn made two surging late runs during the British and Irish Lions' second Test win

Australia v British and Irish Lions, third Test

Venue: Accor Stadium Date: Saturday, 2 August Time: 11:00 BST

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app with post-match analysis on BBC iPlayer, Radio 5 Live and the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.

Blair Kinghorn will be a "massive" player for the British and Irish Lions in the third Test against Australia on Saturday, says 2009 tourist Ugo Monye.

The 28-year-old replaces James Lowe on the left wing as one of two changes from the starting XV that dramatically clinched the series last Saturday at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Scotland's Kinghorn, who came on for Lowe in Melbourne, impressed in the final quarter by adding dynamism to the Lions attack.

"He'll be magic on Saturday," 2009 Lions tourist Ugo Monye told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast.

"The style of player is often reflected in their personality. Kinghorn loves life and would have celebrated hard at the weekend.

"Lots of players would have felt the nerves in the last 20 minutes. Kinghorn had thrown two interceptions that week [against First Nations and Pasifika] but he did not care. He was rinsing Joseph Suaalii.

"They were getting territory through his pace. He was so good in that last 20 - watch him be massive on Saturday.

"Through boot, line breaks or aerial ability, he will be a big, big player."

The versatile Toulouse back joined the tour late as he was busy winning another Top 14 title, with a knee injury against the ACT Brumbies then giving Hugo Keenan a clear run at the starting full-back spot for the first Test win in Brisbane.

Scotland's Kinghorn overcame his injury and was selected for the Lions' final midweek game against a First Nations and Pasifika XV last Tuesday, before earning a spot on the bench in Melbourne.

"Five or six years ago, Kinghorn may have been like 'don't give me the ball'," former Scotland captain John Barclay added.

"Now he is the player that is like 'give me the ball', we have seen that with Toulouse.

"His mental growth is what separated the athlete and the player he is now."

Australia flanker Valetini misses final Lions Test

Will Skelton and Rob Valetini returned for the second Test and their physicality was a main driver behind Australia's impressive first-half performance.

Valetini was replaced at half-time and Skelton on 47 minutes as the hosts missed their dominant impacts in the second half.

Skelton will start at lock again on Saturday but Valetini misses out as he manages a calf problem.

"Will Skelton is one of the biggest humans on the planet," Monye said.

"I don't know how many players in the second row are game-changing? There aren't many.

"[In one moment at a ruck] he folded Dan Sheehan up like a Macbook. It was ridiculous.

"Even when he does get hit, he lands forward or manages to stand up and it is like 'is this a maul now?' He's such a unique player."

Will Skelton took on the role as the Wallabies' 'enforcer' against the Lions

Prop Taniela Tupou, nicknamed 'Tongan Thor' because of his size, power and heritage, may help fill the Valetini void.

Capped 58 times by Australia, Tupou started for Joe Schmidt's side in November against England and Ireland, but has struggled for form since.

He starts at tight-head in the place of injured Allan Alaalatoa for what will be his first appearance of the Test series.

"The conversation that came out after the first Test was that he doesn't fit Schmidt's model of playing, which is extremely detailed," Barclay said.

"He is an X-factor player with big moments in games but probably doesn't have the quality of input throughout a game."

In an attempt to prove his form to Schmidt, Tupou played for New South Wales Waratahs and First Nations & Pasifika in earlier tour games.

"He is fuelled by anger at not being involved until the last game," Monye added.

"The series is not on the line so you might just be unleashing a beast.

"If he can lock down a scrum and then release havoc, you'll get a good version of him."

Despite last week's improved display by the Wallabies, Barclay believes Andy Farrell's side will easily become the first Lions team since 1927 in Argentina to record a series whitewash.

"That is where I think Australian rugby has been for 18 months to two years. Potential for great performances but don't get it done, or they can't do it consistently," he added.

"The Lions will look at that game and forget the first half happened in Melbourne. They will think 'we are winning 3-0'. I think they will win well."

Experts revealed that Michael van Gerwen won the World Matchplay in 2015, 2016 and 2022

Three-time winner Michael van Gerwen made it through to the second round of the World Matchplay despite a below-par display against Raymond van Barneveld, while Gerwyn Price overcame Daryl Gurney in a heated encounter in Blackpool.

Van Gerwen said he "made things difficult for himself" before eventually seeing off fellow Dutchman Van Barneveld 10-6 in an error-strewn match at the Winter Gardens.

"Raymond didn't play his A-game, but I was more annoyed with my own game because I know I could do better," he told Sky Sports.

"This is a tournament I love to play. I have won it three times. It is always an intense crowd. Everything is perfect. But when you don't play perfect it is really annoying.

"We all know I am a winner. I don't like losing. But maybe this is the start of something really nice."

Price is also through after beating Gurney 10-7, with the pair involved in a heated exchange at the end of the match.

Welshman Price appeared to take issue with Gurney mocking his passionate victory celebration, aggressively shaking his hand before the pair exchanged angry words.

Earlier in the match, Northern Irishman Gurney appeared to mutter an expletive to himself as the two players prepared to walk off the stage for the second break.

The pair previously clashed in 2019 when they had to be separated by security after a Premier League match in Sheffield.

Elsewhere on Monday, English sixth seed Chris Dobey beat Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko 10-5, while compatriot and 14th seed Ross Smith was beaten 10-5 by  Northern Ireland's Josh Rock.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Salford Red Devils fans have protested against the club's ownership this season - they are bottom of Super League having conceded 1,026 points

Salford Red Devils' owners have given Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Mayor of Salford Paul Dennett assurances that the troubled Super League club will be able to finish the season.

The Red Devils' fixture against Wakefield earlier this month was called off because of welfare concerns, with the club having just two senior players available.

Wakefield were awarded a 48-0 win, while Salford eventually committed to facing Leigh in their following game, which they lost 38-6.

Burnham, who previously said he was watching the situation at the club closely, met the club's owners alongside Dennett on Friday.

"We received assurances that completing the Super League season and securing the future of the club were shared priorities," a joint statement said.

"The immediate and most serious challenges in front of the club are paying their payroll at the end of the month, which we received positive assurances from the club owners about."

Huge losses, player exodus and fan 'optimism drained' - inside Salford's crisis

The statement also said that they received positive assurances about an upcoming winding-up petition from His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which was adjourned earlier this year and is set to take place at the High Court on 3 September.

It has been a tumultuous 12 months for Salford, who have been plagued with financial issues despite a takeover by a consortium led by Dario Berta going through on the eve of the season.

In the past month the situation at the club has worsened, with a mass player exodus, problems with wage payments and their chief operating officer, Claire Bradbury, quitting her role, alleging the club's ownership suggested she "sleep with someone at the Rugby Football League" to ease their situation.

Salford said they would be "conducting a thorough internal investigation".

"The club owners also informed us that they're in the process of arranging a bridging loan to assist in seeing the club through to the end of the season and to enable the club to make progress in clearing debts," the mayors' statement continued.

"In light of the bridging loan being pursued, we agreed to work together in hopefully securing an outcome that maintains the club as a going concern.

"We understand how difficult this time is for the club's fans and loyal supporters and want to assure you, we are doing everything within our power to safeguard the club's future."

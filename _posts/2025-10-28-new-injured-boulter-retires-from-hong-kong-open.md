Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Katie Boulter reached a career-high world ranking of 23 last year

An emotional Katie Boulter retired from her first-round match at the Hong Kong Open with injury.

The Briton, 29, called for the trainer and was in tears after deciding she could not continue when trailing 20-year-old Filipino Alexandra Eala 6-4 2-1.

Boulter has won just eight of her past 21 main draw matches, failing to progress beyond the second round of a tournament since the Nottingham Open in June.

Speaking after Boulter left the court, Eala told the crowd: "I'm a little out of words. I think this time of the year is a tough moment for a lot of players, physically and mentally being the end of the season.

"I hope that Katie can take this time to recover and just look back on her season proudly."

Several high-profile players have ended their 2025 campaigns prematurely over recent weeks after suffering injury or health issues. 

British number one Emma Raducanu called time on her season earlier this month after retiring from her two previous matches with illness.

That came after former world number one Iga Swiatek complained the season is "too long and too intense" following a string of injuries among players at the China Open in September.

British men's number one Jack Draper called for the tennis calendar to be adapted after Holger Rune suffered a bad injury in Stockholm.

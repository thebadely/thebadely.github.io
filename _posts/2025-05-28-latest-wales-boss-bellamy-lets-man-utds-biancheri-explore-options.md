Let's dive into the details: A product of Cardiff City's academy, Gabriele Biancheri was snapped up by Manchester United in February 2023

Wales boss Craig Bellamy says he is happy for Manchester United striker Gabriele Biancheri to explore his international options.

Cardiff-born Biancheri has been capped for Wales from under-16 to under-19 level and also qualifies to play for Canada and Italy - the birth places of his parents.

The 18-year-old, a regular scorer for United youth teams, spent last week in Wales' training camp in Spain.

But he was not named in the 27-player squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Belgium.

Instead Biancheri accepted an invitation to join Canada's training camp ahead of their games against Ukraine and the Ivory Coast.

"I like people having options, it's healthy," Bellamy said.

"He's not ready for our squad yet. It's something he'd like to go and have a look at, but I like to think we have done our work as well.

"At the end the decision will be his. He knows where we are and where he is. He's not ready for first-team football with us at this moment.

"It's his decision. I've known him since he was very young and I know his family really well. Whatever he does will be the right thing for him, it's not a problem."

Canada boss Jesse Marsch has praised Biancheri and compared him to his highly rated Lille striker Jonathan David.

The former Leeds boss told Canadian reporters last week: "He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.

"He's a version of Jonathan David. He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.

"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.

"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada."

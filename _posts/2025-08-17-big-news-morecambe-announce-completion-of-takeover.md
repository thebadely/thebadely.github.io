It has been recently reported that Morecambe are set to open their season at home to Altrincham on Saturday

The Panjab Warriors consortium has completed its takeover of Morecambe, the club say.

The announcement of the change of ownership on the day Morecambe were  cleared to belatedly begin their season after the National League approved the deal.

The Shrimps were forced to postpone their opening three fixtures after being suspended from the league.

But a meeting of the National League's club compliance and licensing committee on Sunday said the suspension would be lifted as soon as the paperwork was received regarding the Bond Group's sale to the new owners.

On Sunday evening the Bond Group said:, external "Bond Group Investments can now confirm that it has sold its majority shareholding in Morecambe Football Club to Panjab Warriors."

A transfer embargo will remain in place until all football creditors, including players, staff and HM Revenue & Customs, are paid and payments made from the takeover.

Morecambe, who had been up for sale since 2022, are due to host Altrincham on Saturday, gaving been relegated from the English Football League (EFL) last season amid financial difficulties.

The Panjab Warriors had their takeover initially approved by the EFL in June. Jason Whittingham, who led the Bond Group, said the two parties agreed terms the following month, but the deal was not finalised.

Culture secretary Lisa Nandy urged Whittingham to sell the club after Morecambe's suspension in July, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the club should "do the right thing".

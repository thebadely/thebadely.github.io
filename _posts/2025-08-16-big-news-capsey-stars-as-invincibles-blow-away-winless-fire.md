Oval Invincibles 150-6 (100 balls): Capsey 55 (34); Matthews 2-18

Scorecard. Table

Alice Capsey whacked her second half-century in this year's edition of The Hundred as Oval Invincibles eased to a 40-run victory over winless Welsh Fire.

Capsey's 55 off 34 balls featured seven fours and one six as she provided the backbone of the Invincibles' imposing total of 150-6.

It was the 21-year-old's second fifty in as many matches following a lean run which had seen her score just one half-century in her past 32 T20 or Hundred innings.

Capsey has also struggled in England colours this summer with five single-figure scores in six T20 international innings, but this was another outing brimming with confident strokeplay.

It was almost a shock when Capsey was out - the crowd stunned when she was dismissed caught and bowled by Shabnim Ismail, who bagged 2-31.

Marizanne Kapp took over where Capsey left off and boosted the total with an unbeaten 47 off 32 balls while Hayley Matthews bowled tightly to collect 2-18.

Set the highest chase in the women's tournament at The Oval - and the fourth highest overall - Fire lost the dangerous Matthews early on for 12.

Sophia Dunkley carried the charge and looked well poised to make a fist of it with a knock of 56 off 41 balls.

But when she chipped Sophia Smale into the hands of Phoebe Franklin at long-off with the score on 90-6 and 29 balls Fire's hopes were effectively extinguished.

Capsey also impressed with the ball, finishing with 2-16, as Fire were bowled out for 111 with Smale the pick of the attack after she snaffled 3-13.

Invincibles' win lifts them up a place to fourth spot, level on eight points with fifth-placed Manchester Originals, while Fire are bottom on zero.

Scorecard. Table

Teenager Tilly Corteen-Coleman claimed 4-13 as Southern Brave moved top of The Hundred standings with a six-wicket victory over Trent Rockets.

The 17-year-old left-arm spinner helped reduce the Rockets to 55-8 before Kirstie Gordon's battling 32 from 27 boosted their total to 106.

Corteen-Coleman's victims included England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt as she finished with her best figures in her 12th match of the tournament.

England seamer Lauren Bell was also in the wickets as she snared an impressive 3-16 from her 20 balls to extend her lead as the top wicket-taker in this year's competition. 

Brave had a bit of top-order wobble at the start of the chase at 10-2 when Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Laura Wolvaardt departed for four and one respectively.

Maia Bouchier steadied the ship with 42 off 30 balls in a 69-run stand with Sophie Devine, only to be stumped after dancing down the pitch to Aussie all-rounder Alana King.

Some tight bowling from Ash Gardner, Heather Graham and King ensured the game went down to the final set of five balls but Devine's unbeaten 41 ensured Brave got home with two balls to spare.

Brave are now four points clear of second-placed Northern Superchargers at the top of the table on 16 points while the Rockets remain in sixth.

The highlight of Sunday's action is the cross-Pennine derby between Manchester Originals and Northern Superchargers.

The women's game at Old Trafford begins at 11:00 BST and the men's 14:30.

Birmingham Phoenix also host London Spirit on Sunday.

The women's game is at 14:30 and then men's 18:00.

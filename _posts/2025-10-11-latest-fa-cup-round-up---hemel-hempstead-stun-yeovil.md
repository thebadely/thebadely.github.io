Experts revealed that Morgan Williams couldn't help National League Yeovil avoid an upset at National League South Hemel Hempstead Town

Hemel Hempstead Town will take their place in the main draw of the FA Cup for just the third time in 105 seasons after beating previous giant-killers Yeovil Town 2-1.

The Tudors lost Isiah Noel-Williams to a straight red card for an off-the-ball incident after just 25 minutes, but took the lead through skipper Kyle Ajayi's low finish six minutes before the break.

Yeovil, 11th in the National League, looked to have earned a replay when Harvey Greenslade levelled with 20 minutes left.

But Finley Wilkinson headed an 87th-minute winner to send the National League South team into the first round proper for the first time in 11 years.

The other two upsets on the day came in Kent.

National League Solihull Moors lost 2-0 at National League South Ebbsfleet while the latter's local and divisional rivals Tonbridge Angels also bowed out.

Managed by former Millwall stalwart Alan Dunne, who was on the bench for the Lions during the 2004 final against Manchester United, Angels lost 2-1 at home to Isthmian League Premier Division side Chatham Town, who reached round one for the first time in 97 years.

When is the FA Cup first-round draw?

Eighth tier Maldon & Tiptree of Isthmian League Division One North are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition with the first round draw taking place on Monday.

The Jammers earned their sixth FA Cup win of the campaign - as many wins as a Premier League team would take to win the competition - having entered in the extra preliminary round on 1 August, beating Flackwell Heath 1-0.

Former West Ham forward Freddie Sears headed the only goal of the game, in which the ambitious Essex side played the entire second half with 10-men, former Dagenham keeper Elliot Justham saved a penalty and ex-Charlton, QPR and Ipswich forward Macauley Bonne made his debut.

The sole ninth-tier side in the round, Whitstable Town, bowed out 5-1 at National League Wealdstone while eighth-tier Runcorn Linnets lost 1-0 to National League North side Buxton, who made it to the first round for the third time in five seasons.

At the other end of the non-league scale, 1955 semi-finalists York City won 2-1 at Rochdale, the highest-ranked team in the competition, leading the National League with 10 wins from their opening 12 games.

Hartlepool needed a late leveller to force a replay at Northern Premier League side Gainsborough Trinity while Pools' National League rivals Tamworth overcame Hyde United by the only goal and will be dreaming of another run to the third round, where they gave Tottenham a real scare at The Lamb just last season.

National League North Macclesfield FC made the first round for the first time in their short history with a win over Spalding.

In the opening tie of the round, live on BBC Sport, seventh-tier Farnham Town were denied a famous win at home to National League Sutton United by an agonising 98th-minute equaliser.

Farnham had risen to the Southern Premier South after back-to-back promotions, while Sutton were playing League Two football until dropping into the National League in 2024.

Darryl Sanders twice edged the hosts in front at the start of each half only for Harry Phipps and then Brandon Njoku to level.

Sutton pulled off one of the cup's biggest-ever shocks when they beat top-tier Coventry City in 1989, but looked to be on the wrong end of an upset when Owen Dean netted in the 61st minute.

But, two minutes beyond the allotted six minutes of added time, Jayden Harris popped up to pinch a draw.

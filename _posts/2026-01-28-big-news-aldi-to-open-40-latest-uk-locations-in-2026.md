It has been recently reported that Aldi has unveiled plans to open 40 new stores across the UK in 2026 as part of a £370m investment pledge.

The German-owned supermarket said the new locations would include Southam in Warwickshire, Hastings in East Sussex, and Amersham in Buckinghamshire.

Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said the chain had recognised that there were "areas without an Aldi store". 

He said the expansion from about 1,060 UK stores to a target of 1,500 in the longer-term was designed to address "these gaps".

"We've always believed that access to high-quality affordable food is a right, not a privilege, and that's why it's our mission to make this a reality for customers up and down the UK," Hurley added.

It follows a slew of shop openings last year including Eastbourne, East Sussex, Fulham Broadway in London and Deeside in Wales.

The new investment also forms part of its £1.6bn two-year expansion programme announced in September, with the money going towards the opening a further 80 new shops in that period.

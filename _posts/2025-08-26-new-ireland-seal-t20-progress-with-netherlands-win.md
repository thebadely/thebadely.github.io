Scorecard

Ireland sealed their place in next year's Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier with a seven-wicket victory against the Netherlands in Rotterdam.

Arlene Kelly took five wickets which pushed her past 70 overall in the T20 format, while Gaby Lewis hit a 17th career half century with the bat in the 20-over format.

The win makes it five out of five in the Europe Division One Qualifier and second against the hosts in the four-team round robin to secure top spot and one of the two places available for next year's final qualifier in Nepal in January.

Netherlands won the toss and opted to bat but lost both Phebe Molkenboer and Merel Dekeling for nine with Kelly making her first breakthrough of the day.

Babette de Leede and Robine Rijke offered the Dutch hope with 23 and 25 respectively but when Leah Paul removed de Leede lbw, the wickets began to tumble with Kelly taking Rijke, Sanya Khurana, Caroline de Lange and Silver Siegers.

The hosts were all out after 18.5 overs with Ireland chasing a tally of 110, but were dealt an early blow with Christina Coulter-Reilly out for two.

However, Gaby Lewis led the chase with the captain finding the boundary seven times before being removed on 56 by Hannah Landheer who then also took the wicket of Orla Prendergast on 49.

Ireland were almost there and it was left to Amy Hunter and Laura Delany to see them home with five balls to spare as they maintained their perfect record in the competition.

Lloyd Tennant's team will bid to finish with a flourish on Wednesday when they face Italy in Rotterdam (14:45 BST).

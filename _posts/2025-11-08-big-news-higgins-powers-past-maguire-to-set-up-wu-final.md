Let's dive into the details: John Higgins was playing in his 90th semi-final of a ranking event

John Higgins rolled back the years in a 9-2 victory over fellow Scot Stephen Maguire to reach the final of the International Championship in China. 

The 50-year-old put in a vintage performance to set up a meeting with home hope Wu Yize in Sunday's showpiece. 

Higgins won the first six frames of the day before sealing victory with the first three of the evening session. 

Four-time world champion Higgins is now hoping to use his experience against 22-year-old Wu as he bids to claim a third ranking title of the year. 

"Wu is going to be on the crest of a wave, but I'm hoping he finds the nerves tomorrow because it is his first final in China," said Higgins about his fellow finalist, who beat world champion Zhao Xintong in the first semi-final in Nanjing.  

Higgins ended a four-year wait for a ranking title with victory in the World Open in March, and followed that up in April by winning the Tour Championship. 

"It was pivotal to win the World Open," Higgins told World Snooker. "It gave me that bit of self-belief in my game. It doesn't matter who you are, when you start losing that, the game becomes so difficult."

The world number six showed that belief as he raced into a 6-0 lead over Maguire, firing in century breaks of 101 and 137. 

And after losing the final two frames of the opening session, he bounced back to reel off the three he needed to close out victory, including runs of 93 and 64.

"I am delighted with the way I played," added the 33-time ranking-event winner.

Here’s what you need to know: Gabriel joined Arsenal from Lille in 2020 

Arsenal defender Gabriel will be unavailable for "weeks" after sustaining a thigh injury on international duty, says head coach Mikel Arteta.

The centre-back limped off in visible discomfort during Brazil's friendly against Senegal at Emirates Stadium last weekend and was ruled out of the draw against Tunisia three days later. 

The 27-year-old has been in fantastic form for the Gunners, being a key part of a defence that has conceded just five league goals so far this season as they have opened a four-point lead at the top of the table.

"Gabi is going to be out for weeks," said Arteta, who added that the defender will have another scan next Wednesday, which should give a clearer timeframe of how long he will be out for.

Piero Hincapie and Cristhian Mosquera are both in contention to deputise for Gabriel when Arsenal host rivals Tottenham on Sunday (16:30 GMT).

"It's clearly a blow because he's our leader in our backline and to me it's never a positive thing," added Arteta.

"The good thing is that we have very good options and people have to stand up now and do the job."

Gabriel, a Â£23.1m signing from Lille in 2020, has started all 11 of Arsenal's Premier League matches this term.

Defender Riccardo Califiori is a doubt for the north London derby, having withdrawn from international duty with Italy with a hip problem.

The Italian is yet to train since returning to London but Arteta says he will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness. 

"He has been carrying a few things," said Arteta.

"He hasn't trained yet. Tomorrow we have another training session, let's see how he is."

Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres remains unavailable with a hamstring problem.

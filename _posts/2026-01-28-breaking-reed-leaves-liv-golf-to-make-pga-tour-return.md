Let's dive into the details: Reed is the 2018 Masters champion and a nine-time winner on the PGA Tour

Patrick Reed has announced he is leaving the LIV Golf series to make a return to the PGA Tour.

The 35-year-old, who joined LIV Golf in 2022, follows American compatriot Brooks Koepka in departing the lucrative Saudi Arabia-backed series.

"After careful thought and consideration, my family and I have decided that I will no longer compete on the LIV Golf Tour," Reed wrote on social media.

"I am excited to announce that I am returning to the PGA Tour as a past champion member for the 2027 season and am eligible to begin competing in PGA Tour events later this year."

LIV Golf said, external they "were not able to come to terms with Patrick on a potential contract extension" but were "grateful for everything he contributed during his time" with them.

Koepka announced he was leaving LIV Golf in December and will return to the PGA Tour at this week's Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines.

He is able to play after the PGA Tour recently introduced a new returning member programme.

It allows players who have been away from the PGA Tour for at least two years and have won The Players Championship or a major between 2022 and 2025 to play again on the series, with the avenue closing on 2 February.

However, Reed, who is the 2018 Masters champion, does not meet those criteria and rules dictate that he will not be eligible to play on the PGA Tour again until August, a year after his last LIV appearance.

What does the future hold for LIV Golf after Koepka exit?

A PGA Tour statement said:, external "Given that he resigned his Tour membership prior to violating any Tour regulations, he would be eligible to return to Tour competition on August 25, 2026, as a non-member, provided that he complies with Tour regulations and does not participate in additional unauthorised events.

"At that time, Reed would be eligible to participate in FedExCup Fall events as a non-member and could accept sponsor exemptions or participate in open qualifying for those tournaments.

"Reed would then be able to reinstate his membership for the 2027 Tour season, where he would play out of the past champion category."

It added Reed planned to play on the Europe-based DP World Tour this year, having won the Dubai Desert Classic last week. 

"I will continue to compete and play as an honorary lifetime member on the DP World Tour, which is something that I am truly honored and excited to do," said Reed.

"I'm a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA Tour, which is where my story began with my wife, Justine.

"I am very fortunate for the opportunities that have come my way and grateful for the life we have created. 

"I am moving forward in my career, and I look forward to competing on the PGA Tour and DP World Tour. I can't wait to get back out there and revisit some of the best places on earth.

"I want to thank everyone involved for helping me make this decision. Over the last four years, I have learned a lot about myself, about who I am and who I am not, and for that I am forever grateful."

Reed was part of the 4Aces team in LIV Golf alongside fellow American Dustin Johnson.

"To Dustin Johnson, The Aces, and LIV Golf, I want to thank you for the memories we shared and created together," added Reed.

"To golf fans around the world, I just want to thank you all for your continued support over the years. 

"I just ask that you respect the decision we have made for our family, our children, and our future. Thank you for your continued support."

Reed's move comes with LIV Golf preparing for a fifth season in the first week of February in Riyadh.

"LIV has always been an advocate for player movement and recognises that when golf settles into a new normal, players will not only have the right, but the opportunity to play golf when and where they want," added the LIV statement.

"As we look forward, our focus remains on building teams and a league that fans can believe in and players enjoy - those who compete at the highest level, play the game the right way, and understand the responsibility to grow the game around the world by engaging fans and celebrating partners."

 

Reed strongly hinted he was considering leaving LIV last week, so this is not a major surprise.

But it is still a blow to the rebel circuit, coming so soon after Brooks Koepka became its first star player to return to the PGA Tour.

The crucial question now is will others follow suit?

The PGA Tour is offering three marquee players - Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and Cam Smith - the chance to do so without having to serve a suspension under its returning member programme.

However, they only have until 2 February to decide, and all have said they will remain with LIV for now.

Despite huge financial losses and the departure of two big names, LIV insists it is making progress and remains ambitious. But there will now be more pressure on its Saudi backers to retain the talent they have, and entice new players to join.

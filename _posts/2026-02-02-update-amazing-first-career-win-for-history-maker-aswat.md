It has been recently reported that Aamilah Aswat first learned to ride at St James City Farm

Aamilah Aswat has made history as the first female black British jump jockey to win a UK horse race.

The 20-year-old earned her first win on 9-1 chance Guchen in a handicap hurdle at Kempton Park.

In November, Aswat became the first black British female jump jockey to ride in Britain. 

She said it "felt amazing" to get her first win, in what was only her fourth race, riding Guchen for trainers Kim Bailey and Mat Nicholls.

"He gave me a great feeling all the way round and always felt like he had plenty left," Aswat said.

"My dream is to ride as many winners as I can, and to just get on with it."

She added: "The message I hopefully give out to other people is that if you want to do it, you definitely can and I will be following you every step of the way."

Aswat completed the inaugural Riding A Dream Academy scholarship programme in 2021-22, after which she competed in the Magnolia Cup on the flat at Goodwood this year - following a spell at the British Racing School and took out her jockey license last autumn.

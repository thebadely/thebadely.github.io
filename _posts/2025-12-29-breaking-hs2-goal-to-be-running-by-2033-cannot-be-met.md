Experts revealed that HS2 has confirmed that its aim to get trains running between Birmingham and London between 2029 and 2033 "cannot be achieved".

Birmingham's Curzon Street Station is currently taking shape in the heart of the city but the divisive high-speed railway project has been plagued by serious challenges.

Earlier this year, HS2 CEO Mark Wild acknowledged that construction had been "harder than thought" and "needed a reset" involving a review of the project's cost and schedule.

In an end of year update, HS2 insisted that significant progress had been made throughout 2025 with the project now at an "advanced stage of a comprehensive reset".

However, it went on to say that Mr Wild had "provided advice" to the government confirming that the railway's 2029/2033 opening schedule could not be achieved.

"HS2 Ltd has since been finalising a new range of credible cost and schedule estimates," a statement read.

In this latest update, Mr Wild said he made a commitment to address "the failures of the past and get HS2 on track".

"It's clear that we can only do so with a fundamental reset," he continued.

"Over the last year we've been through the programme with a fine tooth comb and we're now very close to establishing a clear path forward.

"We've shown what can be done and I expect that to continue throughout 2026 and beyond as we deliver HS2 as safely and efficiently as possible and for the lowest reasonable cost."

A number of changes have been made already as part of the reset, including "toughening up" cost controls; strengthening the leadership team and reshaping HS2 into a "less bureaucratic organisation".

It has also established a new construction schedule to prioritise completing the initial phase of the railway between Old Oak Common in London and Birmingham.

In its latest update, HS2 said it was at "peak production", with all 23 miles of deep-bore tunnels having now been excavated on the opening section of the railway between Old Oak Common and Birmingham Curzon Street.

"Figures show 70% of the project's vast earthworks programme has now been delivered," it continued. 

"Almost 300,000 tonnes of steel has been used – 69% of that required for the railway.

"HS2 is now focused on completing the complex civil engineering programme across the 140-mile route, ahead of the next vital stage when the track, signalling and communications systems are installed."

HS2 also said it has increased the number of staff in front-line construction roles to help "drive productivity" and that construction partners exceeded many targets set for them this year.

Here’s what you need to know: Tino Livramento has made 19 appearances for Newcastle United this season

Head coach Eddie Howe admits Newcastle United's defensive options are looking thin after Tino Livramento was ruled out for up to two months with a hamstring injury.

The defender hobbled off in his side's dramatic penalty shootout win against Bournemouth in the FA Cup on Saturday.

Livramento only returned from a knee lay-off earlier this month and Howe said he was "absolutely devastated for him because he's worked so hard to come back".

The 23-year-old, who has three England caps, faces a race against time to prove his fitness before the March internationals against Japan and Uruguay.

The setback leaves Newcastle light of defensive options at a time when Dan Burn, Fabian Schar and Emil Krafth are already out.

"Defensively we're really stretched," Howe said following his side's 2-0 defeat in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Manchester City. 

"We're pinning our hopes on Dan being back pretty soon. 

"That would give us a massive lift and, of course, the transfer market is still available to us."

Burn suffered a broken rib and punctured lung in the derby defeat against Sunderland, but could return before the end of the month.

Howe also has the option of recalling left-back Matt Targett, who is on loan at Middlesbrough, while there are still two-and-a-half weeks left for the club to recruit in the transfer window.

Newcastle have money to spend, if needed, but any mid-season moves would have an impact on what the club can do this summer when there are potentially better options available and more value in the market.

Howe has openly questioned if the "right player" is obtainable in the mid-season window.

But Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, Lewis Hall, Kieran Trippier and midfielder Lewis Miley, who has filled in expertly at right-back, are his only available senior defensive options going into Sunday's trip to Wolves.

Newcastle then face PSV, Aston Villa (twice), Paris St-Germain, Liverpool, Manchester City, Brentford and Tottenham over the course of 24 days.

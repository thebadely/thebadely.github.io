It has been recently reported that Spa-Francorchamps will host the Belgian Grand Prix for four out of six years from 2026-2031, taking 'fallow years' in 2028 and 2030

Formula 1 moves into the second half of the season with the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps from 25-27 July.

It's also a sprint weekend so extra points are on offer in Saturday's 15-lap race.

After winning the past two grands prix, Lando Norris has narrowed the gap in the drivers' championship to his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri to eight points.

Sunday's main grand prix, over 44 laps, starts at 14:00 BST.

Commentary of the race will be on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app and most smart speakers.

The weather at Spa, located in the Ardennes Forest, is notoriously unpredictable and the early forecast suggests this year will be no exception.

A high of 23C is predicted for all three days with light showers expected on the Friday and Saturday. Sunday is looking sunnier but the possibility of rain remains.

Laurent Mekies has previously worked for the now defunct Arrows team, Red Bull's junior team, governing body the FIA and Ferrari

Following Christian Horner's sacking as Red Bull team principal and chief executive, Laurent Mekies takes charge for the first time after his promotion from second team Racing Bulls.

The 48-year-old Frenchman had been at Racing Bulls since the start of the 2024 season and was previously racing director for Ferrari.

It is the first time anyone other than Horner has been in charge of Red Bull's main F1 team since their debut in 2005.

Englishman Alan Permane, 58, has been promoted to team principal of Racing Bulls from his position as racing director.

Could Horner end up at another F1 team?

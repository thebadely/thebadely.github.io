Let's dive into the details: Universal Studios' UK theme park was given the green light this week, a decision creating buzz for families up and down the country who might one day want to go.

After months of discussions, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Steve Reed gave planning permission for the park to be constructed in Kempston Hardwick, close to Bedford.

This isn't just another attraction - it's an attempt by the US entertainment giant to build one of the biggest theme parks in the world. 

Universal mentioned in planning documents that a country like the UK should have at least two global theme parks, and this project was described as a "generational opportunity".

But can Universal pull off something of quite this scale, going up against the likes of Disneyland Paris? As BBC News heard from locals, it might be a tall order - and not everyone is happy.

"They haven't bought enough land; what they should be buying is 2,000 acres somewhere and put their theme park in the middle," says Claudia Pixley, 46, who lives in a bungalow on the road where the theme park entrance will be built.

"But as it happens, some of these roads around here are tiny village roads.

"Anything goes wrong on the M1 or the A421, this whole area is at a standstill... and then you want to put Universal Studios in the middle of that."

She describes the project as "absolute madness" and says representatives of Universal have approached her about buying her home, where she's lived for the last decade, but she wants to stay put in her "little slice of Eden".

She may well be one of few people in the area unhappy about the new park. According to Universal, in the Bedford area 92% of those who responded to its survey of 6,000 people were supportive of the development.

But it raises an interesting point about what might and might not be achievable in the grand vision for Universal UK to rival some of the biggest and best current theme parks.

Slated to open by 2031, the park is expected to draw 8.5 million annual visitors and could feature the tallest rides seen in Europe. The total size of the resort would be 268 hectares (662 acres), with the theme park 96.7 hectares (238 acres). 

By comparison, Disneyland Paris is by several estimates just under 52 hectares (130 acres), though some of Disney's other parks worldwide are far larger.

Universal said its UK visitor numbers were expected to rise to 12 million by 2051, which could make it the most-visited park in Europe by today's standards. According to Forbes, Disneyland Paris held that title last year with 10.2 million visitors.

However, even at opening, 8.5 million is more than three times the attendance of the UK's biggest parks today:

For content creator Theme Park Kate, who specialises in theme parks and attractions on TikTok, Universal's future attraction could be "a huge game changer within Europe" and the ambition with its size and rides is realistic.

"It will potentially be a theme park that can compete with the popularity of Disneyland Paris, which has dominated the European theme park market for many years now," she tells BBC News. 

The theme park fan speculated that the park would benefit from using intellectual property (IP) that has not been used at other locations around the world.

She adds: "Harry Potter has been done now at various Universal parks, but a new IP like the rumoured James Bond or Lord of the Rings will be unique to the park and bring in a large amount of fans that will want to see these brand new experiences for themselves for the very first time."

Last year, a source told the BBC that the new park could include James Bond, The Lord of the Rings, Paddington and Jurassic World-themed rides - although a Universal spokesperson said it was too early to confirm this.

Theme Park Kate is hopeful this could have a ripple effect of boosting the country's existing parks and forcing them to "step up their game" to match Universal.

YouTuber Jack Silkstone, who visits theme parks around the world, agrees with the sentiment. He lives "next door" to Thorpe Park - and his message to any unhappy Bedford residents like Claudia is that living on the doorstep of a theme park is "honestly a dream".

"Everyone has some form of connection to the park - whether they work there themselves, they know someone that works there, they love to visit, or they aspire to work at the park when they're older," he says. 

"It creates a real sense of community that then spills out into the wider surrounding towns."

Jack sees the projected scale of the Universal UK park as a huge oportunity for the UK's economy, and seems confident that the company can pull off its aims for scale.

"We're very lucky, we've got some amazing, classic theme parks already in this country. But Universal are global leaders in the theme park industry; they do it different."

Universal said it expected to directly create 8,050 jobs when it opens, with many staff coming from the surrounding areas.

Wixams, a town which will border the new theme park, will also get an upgraded four-platform railway station as part of the proposals.

Despite the concern expressed by some like Claudia that the area may not be able to cope with an influx of visitors, Bedford borough councillor Marc Frost says councillors have been assured that traffic surveys are complete and road infrastructure will be in place.

Universal's engagement with local officials suggested they "genuinely want to work and get on with their neighbours", he adds.

Another consideration for those in the local area is property prices - and some could fare better than others here, too.

Nick Kier, a partner at Lane & Holmes estate agents, says he already knows of some people who have already bought property close to the Universal site, which they plan to rent out to visitors in the future.

He explains "there are definite winners and losers in this scenario" and "you cannot expect, with that amount of investment coming in... that the prices won't go up".

"The people who are living here for a completely other reason will find it more expensive... That's the losing side."

At the same time, he acknowledges that local hotels for miles would be likely to benefit.

What's clear is that the Universal park could dwarf much of its competition if all goes to plan, and while the impacts can be a double-edged sword, many are keen to see what its opening brings.

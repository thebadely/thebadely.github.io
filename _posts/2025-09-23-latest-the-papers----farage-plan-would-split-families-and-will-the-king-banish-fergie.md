Experts revealed that The Guardian says Nigel Farage is facing cross-party condemnation for his proposals to deport some legal migrants if Reform UK wins the next election. The i  Paper calls the idea both "radical" and "sketchy" while the Daily Mirror labels it "disastrous". 

The Times says European sources have dismissed any prospect of downgrading the status of EU nationals who are resident in Britain and were given rights by the post-Brexit treaty: one diplomat asks, "Why would we agree to make EU nationals worse off than they are now?". 

The Sun's editorial accepts there are some unanswered questions about the plan but says it is likely to prove popular with voters and that the government must "wake up" to the issues Reform is highlighting.

The Times says health officials in the UK have reassured pregnant women that paracetamol is safe to take, after US President Donald Trump said it was "not good" and linked to autism. The paper says scientists were "dismayed" by his comments and have pointed to a body of evidence refuting any link. 

The Daily Telegraph says British experts condemned "fear-mongering".

The Daily Mail asks how the Royal family can continue to "indulge" the Duchess of York, after charities cut ties with her because of her links to Jeffrey Epstein. Its headline reads "Will the King now banish Fergie?" 

The Times sets out how, "one by one, charities left the Duchess behind" yesterday. It says that what started as a trickle at lunchtime led to the dam bursting at teatime. The Mirror says Sarah Ferguson's life in the public eye now "lies in tatters".

The Telegraph leads with the call from a think tank with close ties to the government for Chancellor Rachel Reeves to cut national insurance and increase income tax in the Budget. The paper says the Resolution Foundation has often been the "petri dish" of Labour policy in recent years, and that the Treasury is packed with its former staff. It calls the idea a "Â£6bn raid on pensioners, landlords and the self-employed".

Leinster ensured that they topped Pool Three of the Champions Cup and secured home advantage for the last-16 stage by securing a hard-earned 22-13 win over Bayonne at Stade Jean-Dauger on Saturday.

It was another unconvincing performance from the Irish province who were made to battle for their victory against the dogged French hosts who fell behind for the first time in the encounter when Sam Prendergast crossed six minutes from time.

A Sireli Maqala try helped Bayonne to a 10-3 half-time lead and while Dan Sheehan's converted score drew Leinster level, a Segonds penalty nudged the home side ahead again.

Prendergast's converted touchdown put the visitors in front and Max Deegan's late score put an extra gloss on the score-line for the four-time champions.

Leinster had already qualified for the knockout stage thanks to a narrow 25-24 win over La Rochelle last weekend but now move up the seedings and will be at home until at least the quarter-finals should they progress that far.

Bayonne were unable to advance or drop down to the Challenge Cup and now remain without a point from their four group fixtures.

Mid-table in the Top 14, they have now lost six of their past seven games in all competitions.

Leinster, in contrast, are unbeaten in nine since losing to Munster in October.

The sides were contesting a match in European competition for the first time and Bayonne had the better of the first half, displaying intensity and physicality.

The French side cut the Leinster defence open for the opening try of the game after 15 minutes.

They secured quick ball from a line-out, with wing Yoham Orabe breaking through the Leinster line, then popping the ball to Maqala, who ran in under the posts. Joris Seginds added the extras.

Ireland prop Tadhg Furlong came off injured and was replaced by Thomas Clarkson, while soon after Harry Byrne put Leinster's first points on the board with a penalty.

Bayonne restored their seven-point advantage when Segonds, the top points scorer in the Top 14, landed a kick from 45 metres after Leo Cullen's side infringed at a line-out.

Clarkson then scrambled over the line but the officials adjudged that there had been a double movement as he attempted to ground.

Fifteen minutes into the second half Leinster drew level with a converted try from Sheehan.

Prendergast made a break and threw a wide pass to Jimmy O'Brien, who did well to ride a tackle before off-loading inside to the Ireland hooker, who produced a trademark burst of pace to scurry over.

A second penalty of the match for Segonds restored Bayonne's lead and soon after O'Brien went over after getting on the end of Prendergast's grubber kick but replays showed that the full-back had spilled the ball as he went over the line.

Segonds passed up the opportunity to extend the lead as his penalty sailed wide of the posts after Sheehan was penalised for collapsing the maul.

With six minutes remaining Leinster finally breached their opponents' defences again when Byrne chipped ahead and the ball bounced favourably for Prendergast, who dotted down between the posts.

Deegan dived over in the corner in the final minute to increase the winning margin.

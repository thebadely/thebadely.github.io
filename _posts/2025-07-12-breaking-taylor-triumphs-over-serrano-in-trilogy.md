Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Katie Taylor shared 30 rounds and one hour in the ring with Amanda Serrano

Ireland's Katie Taylor beat Amanda Serrano for the third time in their epic trilogy, winning their bout at New York's Madison Square Garden on a majority decision after a chess match of a fight.

Two of the cards read 97-93 in favour of undisputed light-welterweight champion Taylor, with the third card unable to split them at 95-95.

The fight played out in front of a sold-out arena for the latest instalment of women's boxing's great rivalry and, though not quite the all-out war of their previous meetings, it remained just as gripping.

"We have made history three times," said Taylor, on a night when the iconic MSG hosted an all-female card for the first time.

"It is such a historic fight and a pleasure to share the ring with her. We are history makers forever."

Untouchable Scotney shines, but Marshall suffers defeat

Unlike the scoring debate from their second fight in November, it was difficult to disagree with this verdict as Taylor was much more economical on the night.

Puerto Rico's Serrano enjoyed some success in rounds six and eight, but the challenger was unable to sustain the pressure with some vintage moments from 39-year-old Taylor helping her turn the tide and produce a strong finish to put a seal on victory.

"I want to thank Amanda Serrano, what an amazing fighter," said Taylor.

"I thought I did enough [to win]. I boxed smart and well, she wasn't catching much tonight but it is always a close contest.

"I have a huge amount of respect for Amanda. What a warrior."

Serrano, 36, acknowledged that her change of approach this time may not have paid off as there was no immediate protest at the outcome.

"I tried something different, it was all about working smarter not harder," she said.

"I tried to keep my distance and not fight with her because apparently it didn't work the first two fights. We tried to stay with the long punches and one twos, and it just wasn't enough."

Taylor's record is now 25 wins and one loss

Taylor was in no mood to make a rash decision in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The Serrano saga is absolutely finished, so what is left to do in the ring? 

Perhaps complete another trilogy by taking on Chantelle Cameron to break their tie. 

"Chantelle has to see if she can sell out a [capacity] arena first," Taylor replied on that possibility.

"I don't think she can sell out any stadium at all. I think I've made her more money than she really deserves."

Of course, there is still the Croke Park itch that Taylor would absolutely love to scratch, yet it is highly unlikely because of costs and a limit on non-GAA events at the Dublin stadium in 2025. 

That would mean it would roll into 2026 which, by then, Taylor would be 40.

"I don't know," Taylor said on her future.

"It's not like I have anything left to prove, but I will take some time and then make a decision on what I want to do in a few weeks."

Serrano and Taylor tangle at Madison Square Garden

It was back to the scene of their initial meeting back in 2022 when Taylor grabbed their first of her wins. The second in November 2024 was a little more contentious, but again a fight-of-the-year contender.

The Irish fans again arrived in their thousands to roar on their national treasure, but were outnumbered by Puerto Ricans who were creating a huge din on any occasion they got a glimpse of Serrano from her dressing room. 

It was another sign the cards were stacked against Taylor who would need something big to complete the clean sweep.

It was a cagey opening round with both flicking out jabs which were falling short as perhaps they did not want to be the first to overly commit.

Such an approach was not likely to last too long.

Things were heating up and momentarily caught fire midway through the third as Taylor quickened her feet and let go with a flurry as Serrano sought to reply and the crowd responded. 

With Taylor in the corner towards the end of the round and the challenger prowling, the Irishwoman again let a rapid flurry go as she enjoyed the first success of not in the fight.

It was already at a stage where Serrano needed to get something going of her own but Taylor was again the better of the pair in the fourth, shooting fast flurries as the Serrano was either unwilling or unable to fully commit with the rounds ticking by.

The output did increase in the fifth and Serrano began to gain more success, but Taylor had plenty of her own moments.

Perhaps Serrano's plan was to up the tempo in that second half and she appeared to get through with power shots, yet it was a head clash which would just stun Taylor momentarily, while a shot right on the bell again gave the Irishwoman something to think about.

The seventh was another round in which Serrano sought to get impose herself further but Taylor replied with a flurry.

It was not as explosive as their previous contests but was still extremely competitive and it was all to play for heading into the final four minutes.

Serrano was the aggressor in the ninth but was falling short with much of her work and Taylor would punish with crisp counters and seemed to have the upper hand in the final round as she was finding the mark.

Still, there was a nervous wait for the result before Ireland could celebrate as Taylor retained her crown on what may well prove to be her swansong.

Experts revealed that Grace Clinton and Jess Park were both part of England's Euro 2025-winning squad

Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton has joined Manchester City, with England team-mate Jess Park going the other way on transfer deadline day for the Women's Super League.

Clinton, 22, had attracted interest from several clubs this summer with just a year remaining on her contract and no renewal agreed.

Rivals City were keen to bring her in and have allowed fellow England international Park to head to United in return, softening the blow.

Both players, who were part of England's Euro 2025-winning squad, have signed four-year deals.

Neither club would disclose a transfer fee for the players, but it is believed City have paid more for Clinton, therefore transferring a net sum to United to cover the difference.

In a social media post earlier on Thursday night, Clinton said of her United departure: "This has been a very difficult decision for me because of the love I have for my team-mates and for you, the fans. However, I feel the future of the club and I aren't on the same page.

"For me personally, the next step is about growth. I want to continue to develop and learn." 

On her move to City, she added: "I want to get better and grow and learn things in my career and I think there are amazing people here to learn things from. To play this style of football will be really enjoyable."

Park, 23, completed a medical at Carrington on Wednesday evening which accelerated City's talks with Clinton.

United see her as a high-quality addition and, while the deals are separate, Park is considered a strong replacement for Clinton.

"I wanted to break out of the boundaries and push myself to take on a new challenge. I'm the sort of person who wants to keep improving and pushing limits, and I think this is the perfect place for me to do that," said Park.

"I'm a player who wants the ball, and when I get it I like to look up and try and make things happen for my team-mates, so I think I can fit in really well here. I know the ambitions are very high and I want to help the team push towards them."

Marc Skinner's side were keen to keep Clinton, but they also wanted to avoid losing her for free next year.

In previous seasons, United were criticised for losing striker Alessia Russo and goalkeeper Mary Earps for nothing after their contracts expired due to failed renewal negotiations.

Grace Clinton and Jess Park look set to swap clubs

Clinton is widely regarded as one of England's most promising players having made an instant impression on the international stage.

She scored on her debut in February 2024 - a 7-2 thrashing of Austria - and made  Sarina Wiegman's squad for Euro 2025, where she came on as a substitute in five of England's six matches.

The Everton academy graduate joined United in 2022 but spent two successful seasons on loan at Bristol City and Tottenham respectively before breaking into Skinner's team on a consistent basis last year.

It was clear Clinton was unlikely to sign an extension to her United deal, but the club triggered a clause in her contract this summer to add on a further year.

That allowed United to consider financial offers, even if they came from rivals Manchester City, as they were keen to avoid another high-profile name leaving the club on a free transfer, as happened previously with Russo and Earps.

Park's arrival, in a separate deal, means United will have a ready-made replacement.

While Clinton's departure is no doubt a blow, United can take confidence from their ability to attract Park, who has made an equally strong impression in recent years.

She joins fellow summer signings and Sweden internationals Julia Zigiotti Olme and Fridolina Rolfo - between the three of them racking up 169 international caps.

Park burst on to the scene during a loan spell at Everton two seasons ago and scored within two minutes of her England debut against Japan in November 2022.

Despite competition for places at City, Park was used regularly but sees the potential to become a key figure at United alongside England team-mate Ella Toone.

She ends an eight-year stay at City, in which she has helped them win the FA Cup and two League Cups.

It is common in the WSL for players to represent both Manchester clubs with England defender Alex Greenwood one of the most high-profile as she joined City from Lyon, a year after leaving United, who she captained to WSL 2 success in 2019.

Let's dive into the details: The Times leads on an interview with the prime minister, with the headline "Starmer hails Brexit reset". According to the paper, Starmer will announce his EU youth mobility plans when he welcomes European leaders to London on Monday, as part of a wider deal with the bloc. 

The Conservatives and Reform UK have warned the scheme, under which young people could move for up to two years, would bring a return of free movement. The prime minister has told the paper that isn't the case.

In an interview with the Guardian, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggests the government is looking for closer ties with the European Union. It's headline reads: "UK on path to deeper EU relationship." Reeves is quoted as saying Monday's UK-EU summit would not be a one-off.

Prime Minister Starmer is prepared to make a U-turn on his plans to cut winter fuel payments, according to the Daily Express, which has "Finally some sense" in its headline. 

The Daily Mirror also welcomes "new hope on winter fuel". It says the prime minister has refused to rule out making more people eligible for the allowance.

Parking fines could "rocket" to more than Â£120, according to the Daily Mail. The paper says ministers are reviewing the cap on tickets issued by councils in England and Wales, in what it calls a "major blow for millions of hard-pressed motorists".

The Financial Times says the pharmaceutical firm, Novo Nordisk, has fired its chief executive. Shares in the company - which makes the obesity drug, Ozempic - have halved in the past year, according to the paper. Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told the FT that he didn't regret his decisions as head of the company.

Experts revealed that As a guide dog handler of 26 years, my heart falls every time I hear the fatigued pants of dogs in heatwave weather.

Animal welfare charity the RSPCA says that dogs are 10 times more likely to suffer heat-related illnesses from exercising in hot weather than from overheating in cars. Both are tremendously bad for your dog.

This is because canines have a very limited ability to regulate their temperature.

They do not sweat like humans – only perspiring a small amount through the pads on their paws, with their often thick fur coats meaning their core temperature can rise quickly in high temperatures.

Heavy panting, difficulty breathing, excessive drooling, lethargy and drowsiness are all key signs that your dog is too hot.

In extreme cases, dogs vomit and finally lose consciousness. If your dog is in trouble,  the RSPCA says you should move the dog to a shaded and cool area and immediately pour cool, but not very cold, water over the dog, avoiding their head. 

The charity says wet towels should not be placed over the animal because it could cause heat to become trapped. If possible , allow the dog to drink small amounts of cool water and continue to pour cool water over them, but not so much that they begin to shiver. When breathing settles, head straight to the vets.

My plea to dog owners is not to walk or exercise your dog in hot weather. Please understand that this is not fear-mongering. Your dog can overheat in moments and it is totally avoidable in most cases.

It struck me as unbelievable frankly this weekend that while I, as a blind person was being sighted guided by my girlfriend in 30C (86F) weather because it was too hot for my working dog to be out, we passed nearly a dozen dog walkers obliviously walking their best friends into danger at around 1pm.

I know not everyone is an experienced dog handler – but I can't begin to imagine how anyone could fail to notice the obvious discomfort, the heavy panting, the foot-dragging and laboured breathing in direct sunlight that had us reaching for our iced-water bottles.

So what can we do to protect our animals in hot weather?

For starters, when the mercury hits 20C, I place the back of my hand on the pavement to check I can comfortably keep it there. It's a great indicator that your dog's pads will be ok too. 

I always pack a folding water travel bowl and carry chilled or iced water. In addition, when the temperature hits 24C or above, I start asking whether it's safe to be out at all and usually decide at 25C and above that it's too hot to walk my dog more than a few feet from my front door to an air-conditioned cab.

But what about exercise?

Your dog needs life more than it needs a walk. On super-hot days, keep your dog indoors and ideally air-conditioned or in a cool room with a fan.

Your dog will be fine without a walk for a few days but you could provide playtime at home by throwing a toy. 

If you are planning to walk your dog, do it in the very early morning or very late evenings. If you walk your dog in extreme heat you are literally putting their lives at risk. They're too important – keep them safe, cool and inside.

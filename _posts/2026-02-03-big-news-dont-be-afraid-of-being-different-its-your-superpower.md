Here’s what you need to know: 'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'

Bruce Mouat had to settle for Olympic curling silver in 2022. This month, in Italy, he will attempt to upgrade that in the mixed and men's events, with his Team Mouat rink strong favourites to triumph in the latter.

Life has not always been easy for the 31-year-old from Edinburgh, who came out as gay in 2013 after a life-changing conversation with a sports psychologist. He says telling his team-mates "was possibly the best thing I ever did for my career".

So, with the benefit of that experience both in life and in curling, what would Mouat tell his younger self if he had the chance?

Dear Bruce,

When you were 10, you wrote a school project called, 'Future Me'. Well, here I am, your future self, finally replying.

Let me start by saying how proud I am of you. You've always been a dreamer and that's one of your greatest strengths. The future you imagined was big, bold and full of life.

But it might not turn out quite as simply as you first thought. You wrote about having six kids, eight dogs and 10 cats. Spoiler alert, that doesn't quite happen.

Here's the important part, though: you're happy. You made it. And you're living the part of your dream that really mattered, building a life that you're proud of and sharing it with special people.

You're competitive and you want to be the best at everything you do. 

That's fine, it'll get you far, but you don't have to compare yourself to others. Especially when you're at school. Academics are not your strong suit - your strengths lie elsewhere.

However, that does not give you permission to stop trying at school. Sport might be your passion but please try to stop falling asleep in Mr Simpson's English class, pretending to read your book. You're fooling no one.

You're so lucky to have two incredible parents, Marie and Bob (or better known as Mum and Dad), who understand you more than you realise. 

They've always let you try every sport you were curious about, and they supported you even when what you were saying sounded completely unrealistic. They could see it wasn't just a phase, it was your passion.

When you watched Kelly Holmes win her two gold medals at the Athens Olympics in 2004, something inside you sparked. Let that feeling grow. Let it push you to dream bigger than you ever thought you could.

But let me save you some time, and a few freezing mornings in the mud. Cross-country running isn't your sport.

Bruce Mouat on representing the LGBTQ community in elite sport

Some of your favourite family memories will come from playing together in the Christmas bonspiels. Dressing up in ridiculous costumes and playing curling competitions with Mum and Dad and your brother, Colin. 

Those moments are special. They show you the incredible community behind curling, and that's a huge part of why you fall in love with the sport.

One memory that will always stand out is when your whole family went dressed as the cast of Shrek, and you as Puss in Boots. 

And if you feel like "practising" in Mum's boots for the week leading up to the event, go for it. Those boots are fabulous.

Curling will give you so much and the people at Curl Edinburgh will support you endlessly. 

Remember to be grateful for the opportunities that come your way and remember to thank the people that give you those chances - they might not be around as long as you expect.

Let me tell you, the journey is incredible. The results come, but it's never a straight line. There are highs and there are lows. 

Some of those lows will make you question whether elite sport is really for you. I know you doubt yourself at times, but you're far stronger than you think.

You'll worry about what others think of you - that's human, and it's completely natural. But one day you'll realise what truly matters is what you think of yourself.

So be proud of who you are. Don't be afraid to show the world. And by sharing your story you'll inspire others - that is what really matters.

Some of the toughest moments in your career will end up teaching you more about yourself - and about the sport - than any training session ever could. 

The tough moments will hurt, but lean on the friends and family around you, they will help you through it.

One last thing... you're different to the other kids in your class. 

I know you want more than anything to just fit in, but there will come a time in your life when you must make a tough decision, one that you think could change everything for you.

It does change everything. But you become a better curler, a better friend and a better person for it. Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower.

P.S. Please don't dye your hair when you're 15â¦ you look ridiculous.

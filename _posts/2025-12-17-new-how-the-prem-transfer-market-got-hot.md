Here’s what you need to know: England internationals George Martin, Chandler Cunningham-South and George Furbank have all found themselves at the centre of speculation over possible moves 

Mark McCall has been in the Prem for more than 15 years. And he can't remember anything like it.

"It's busier than it has ever been," says Saracens' director of rugby of the top-flight player market.

Saracens have been the source of some of that activity.

Leicester and England second row George Martin committed to moving south last week. Gloucester's star scrum-half Tomos Williams is expected to follow suit.

But the speculation swirls more widely.

England full-back George Furbank has been linked to a move from hometown side Northampton to Harlequins., external

Hoskins Sotutu, a star of Super Rugby, will apparently be a statement signing for Newcastle Red Bulls., external

Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake confirmed their switches to Gloucester within an hour of each other on Monday.

The sudden flurry of movement is a product of two things.

Earlier this year, the prospect of ambitious start-up event R360 and its big money-contracts had a cooling effect. Agents kept options open and talks on hold.

The postponement of R360 until 2028 has ended that stand-off, with the prospect of the 2027 Rugby World Cup also spurring movement.

England players are only eligible for selection if they play, or have a contract to play, domestically.

A 2026-27 stint in the Prem is the best platform from which to make a case to head coach Steve Borthwick.

Prop Kyle Sinckler, currently at Toulon, is one of the French-based English-qualified stars rumoured to be considering a return for next season., external

Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson, who has signed up centre Joe Marchant from Stade Francais for next season in a similar deal, says the opportunities and Zoom meetings are coming thick and fast.

"It has been hectic, absolutely hectic for us," he said of his recruitment drive.

"I'm enjoying meeting all these characters.

"There are early negotiations at the start of the season, and a lot of people try to close those deals before Christmas and New Year.

"Then Japanese clubs turf people out because of their quota system in February and March, and then there is a late churn in June as French teams try to balance their books."

Sale, whose co-owner Simon Orange sold his investment firm in January for an estimated Â£1bn, are recruiting armed with depth charts, target lists and a big budget.

Sanderson has spoken about adding "four or five world-class internationals" to his squad.

Newcastle, who previously struggled to hold onto their best players, have recently been taken over by energy drink giant Red Bull, bringing another player to the table for top-end talent.

With the Prem's salary cap set at Â£6.4m, there is plenty of scope for the market to heat up and the merry-go-round to accelerate as clubs pick and choose where to prioritise.

Journalist Neil Fissler is a specialist in the scene, picking up on possible moves for RugbyPass., external

"My favourites are 'if true', 'this will never happen" and 'keep on dreaming'," he says of fans' online responses to his stories.

"It is a strange one, people do like a bit of speculation. Some begrudgingly look at it, some religiously look at it, but it has grown a lot."

Transfer speculation is the summer staple that keeps football's Premier League dominating coverage long after their players have headed off the pitch for their holidays.

Similarly, American sports' drafts and trades generate headlines and interest.

While a football-style deadline day is not practical given overseas leagues work to their own timelines, Prem clubs have been given licence to exploit the intrigue and interest around big moves.

Bristol announced Louis Rees-Zammit's summer arrival with a barrage of videos, including a lightning bolt-filled tease and behind-the-scenes footage of his signing., external

A public tug-of-war over Chandler Cunningham-South ended with Harlequins' celebrating the England back row's retention by dunking on rivals Saracens, and their inability to keep hold of fellow back row Tom Willis, on social media., external

There is also, in places, an openness about dealings that fuels interest.

Sanderson revealed that Sale's own approach for Cunningham-South faltered because of the wage demands.

Northampton boss Phil Dowson responded to rumours about Furbank's future by insisting his player would be "insane", external not to talk to other clubs to get a sense of his options.

Former Saints wing Chris Ashton told Rugby Union Weekly this week about his 2012 exit from Saints, when he and the club argued over money and he was unceremoniously dropped after agreeing a switch to Saracens.

Such acrimony and presumptions of loyalty seems rarer now.

Fissler, who has been banned by several clubs for scooping their deals in the past, has seen the change.

"It's a good way for people to engage with the sport and its players - and I think the clubs have cottoned on to that," he added.

"I don't quite get so many complaints as I used to from them. It is better to have a player talked about, than not talked about. It does create a bit of a buzz and an appetite."

This year especially, there will be plenty of rumours and movers to sate that hunger.

Let's dive into the details: Les Kiss was a defence coach with Ireland before working under Joe Schmidt as his assistant

Les Kiss will replace Joe Schmidt as Australia head coach in 2026 and will lead the Wallabies in their home Rugby World Cup the following year.

Schmidt will remain in his role for the upcoming Test series against the British and Irish Lions and the Rugby Championship, before leading the Wallabies into next year's inaugural Nations Cup.

Kiss, who previously worked under Schmidt as an assistant coach with Ireland, will remain Queensland Reds head coach until midway through 2026, when Rugby Australia says there will be an "orderly transfer" in leadership.

Australian Kiss, who will become the Wallabies' fifth head coach in seven years, said leading his country at a home World Cup will be the "honour of a lifetime".

"It's an incredibly exciting time for Australian rugby and I am humbled by the opportunity to serve as Wallabies head coach from next year," the 60-year-old said. 

Kiss, formerly director of rugby at Ulster and head coach at London Irish, added: "Joe and I have a strong relationship and a long history of working together, and I am looking forward to building upon the excellent foundations he has laid with the Wallabies.

"I am thrilled to continue with the Reds for the 2026 Super Rugby Pacific season before transitioning into the Wallabies environment. To coach our national team through such an important period, highlighted by a home Rugby World Cup in 2027, is the honour of a lifetime and an opportunity I am truly grateful for."

Is it time for change in the Women's Six Nations?

New Zealander Schmidt was originally set to depart in October following the Rugby Championship but has extended his stay to facilitate Kiss' handover.

The former Ireland boss replaced Eddie Jones as head coach in 2023 following a tumultuous period for the Wallabies.

Michael Cheika resigned following the 2019 World Cup quarter-final defeat by England and replacement Dave Rennie was sacked before the 2023 World Cup.

Jones returned on a five-year deal before the tournament but lasted just nine months as Australia crashed out in the pool stage for the first time in their history.

"My intention to finish at the end of this year's Rugby Championship has been adjusted to fit with Les' availability," said Schmidt, who has led the Wallabies to six victories in his 13 matches in charge.

"I think he's doing a great job with the Reds, so it was important to dovetail with his responsibilities there.

"It has certainly been a privilege to be involved with the Wallabies - the staff and players have worked hard but we all know there's a lot more hard work ahead of us with the British and Irish Lions here in a few months' time.

"For my family, the extension until the end of next July means that they will spend more time with me in Sydney so we will hopefully find a good balance."

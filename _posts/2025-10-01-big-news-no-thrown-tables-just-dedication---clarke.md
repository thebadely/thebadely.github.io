According to new developments, Frazer Clarke and Jeamie TKV headlined in Derby 

Frazer Clarke says he and opponent Jeamie Tshikeva have a "responsibility" to showcase boxing to new audiences by headlining on free-to-air television in Derby on 25 October.

The British heavyweight title fight marks the start of BBC Sport's new broadcast deal with Boxxer.

Coverage will be live on BBC Two from 20:00 to 22:00 BST, with the undercard streamed on BBC iPlayer.

Speaking at a respectful news conference in London, Olympian Clarke said the fight will "bring audiences on different backgrounds".

The 34-year-old said: "This isn't the typical heavyweight contest. There will be no chairs thrown, no tables thrown, there doesn't need to be slang between us.

"This is two men, dedicated to the craft, who love the sport and are willing to compete to be the best in Britain as a heavyweight."

Tottenham's Tshikeva - known as TKV - echoed his opponent's sentiments.

"Not many people realise how big this moment is, not only for Boxxer, BBC, me and Frazer but it's big for British boxing in general," the 31-year-old said.

"Me and Frazer are going to make history."

The British heavyweight belt has a storied history, with past holders including Henry Cooper, Lennox Lewis, Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua.

As the two fighters made their way to the stage a large screen at the news conference displayed images of those four British heavyweight greats.

"It's big, it's prime-time, baby. It's a special moment. I want to be a part of the history. I want my picture to be up there," TKV said.

The pair had previously exchanged words over social media but both talked about how the rivalry has softened over time.

"They once asked him what he thought of me and he said he would use me as a tune-up," TKV explained.

"I took it personally, and he took it personally the way I came at him. There was a bit of back and forth, but over time I respect Frazer a lot."

TKV enters the contest with a record of eight wins and two defeats since turning professional.

"I expect a war, I expect us to go back and forth. I expect it to be that type of fight," TKV said about Clarke.

Clarke, from Burton upon Trent, is looking to rebuild momentum in the professional ranks.

He won bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and enjoyed a decorated amateur career, including Commonwealth Games gold in 2018 and the 2015 national championships.

Known as 'Big Fraze', Clarke turned professional in 2022 and fought for the British title in March 2024, drawing with Fabio Wardley in a gruelling contest.

Wardley, now on the verge of a world-title shot, later handed Clarke a first-round knockout in their rematch, leaving him with a broken jaw that required surgery.

Clarke talked about the ups and down of his career, adding: "I'll be showing everyone that I love this sport and I'll give everything to be British heavyweight champion."

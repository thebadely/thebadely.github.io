Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.

We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.

Interviews will drop on Saturdays across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:35 BST on Saturday, 25 October (and after Sportscene in Scotland).

Reece James started training with Chelsea at the age of six and - having progressed through the academy and into the first team - is now club captain.

James announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful in style, scoring on his debut in a 7-1 win over Grimsby Town in September 2019.

Now 25, James' career highlights so far include making his England debut against Wales in 2020, winning the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021, and being appointed club captain in 2023.

However, things have not always gone smoothly, with a series of injuries affecting him over the past four seasons.

James sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about his career highs, Thiago Silva's influence, and his friendship with seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton.

'He's nearly old enough to be my dad' - Reece James reveals Thiago Silva's impact on his career

Kelly Somers: First question: name, where you're from, and what's your coffee order?

Reece James: The name is Reece James, I grew up in Mortlake, near Richmond - I'm sure more people will know that area. My coffee is a flat white.

Kelly: Has it always been a flat white?

Reece: No, it started with, like, vanilla lattes and stuff.

Kelly: Let's start by talking football. What does football mean to you?

Reece: I mean, from a little kid, it's kind of all I knew in school. I wasn't the brightest kid, and I just loved playing football.

Kelly: What's your earliest memory of playing? Is this tough to answer because it was such a big part of your kind of childhood and growing up?

Reece: No, just because my memory is so bad. My earliest memory was probably, I don't know, going to watch my brother play. He's two years older than me, and he used to play as well.

Kelly: It was big in your household, wasn't it, because your dad was was so heavily involved? He's a football coach too, isn't he? Tell me a bit about that.

Reece: So there was three of us growing up. It was all football mad, and he obviously was a coach as well, and we used to train a lot with him.

Kelly: Do you remember a lot of those sessions? Because I read that as young as the age of four, you were outside and he was doing drills with you in the back garden.

Reece: Yeah, I remember - the drills started young. Thankfully, they paid off for me and my sister [Chelsea and England forward Lauren James].

Kelly: Talk to me about your first ever team that you played for as a youngster, what was it called, and what can you remember?

Reece: I don't remember much, to be honest. It was Kew Park Rangers in Kew. I think I was there for about a year. It was from there that I was scouted for Chelsea. 

Kelly: And you weren't a defender at first, were you? Talk to me about your positional journey and how that changed...

Reece: I started off as a striker, and then eventually moved to the wing, left wing, right wing, and eventually to midfield, and then eventually at right-back, and I hated it at the time.

Kelly: Why did you hate it?

Reece: Because I always wanted to play midfield. You didn't touch the ball as much but one day it just clicked and I've been a right-back since.

Kelly: You said you started as as a forward - who was your idol?

Reece: My idol was [Didier] Drogba. I was a Chelsea fan growing up and he was the player I looked up to.

Kelly: Can you think of a turning point in your career - a moment that has shaped you and the player you have become?

Reece: I would probably say going on loan. Bridging the gap between academy and first-team football is the hardest and that is probably what most players making the  jump find challenging.

Kelly: You're talking about Wigan, of course. Why was Wigan the right club for you at the time? It was miles away from everything you knew in London - why did it work so well?

Reece: The first thing is that I played week in week out, which helps. I gained a lot of experiences - I moved away from my friends and family and had to grow up fast. Playing on a consistent basis helped a lot.

Kelly: Who has had the biggest impact on your career? 

Reece: I would say [Brazil defender] Thiago Silva. He is nearly old enough to be my dad and has played at the highest level for so long. He always tried to help me from the minute he arrived and still does, even now he is not here [having left Chelsea in 2024].

Kelly: In what way would he help you? 

Reece: It was little messages off the pitch. On the pitch, he would sometimes see things that I saw differently and try and paint a different picture.

Kelly: It must have been nice to see him this summer [at the Club World Cup]?

Reece: It was great to see him again. I'm happy that his team did well in the tournament [they lost in the semi-finals to eventual winners Chelsea]. It is always good to see him.

Kelly: If you could go back and replay one match in your career, which would you pick? 

Reece: If the outcome is going to be the same - it would be the Champions League [final].

Kelly: Other than winning, what was so special about that night?

Reece: Not many people expected us to win. [Manchester] City were favourites. The way the game went, 1-0 in the final - they had chances but they didn't take them. It is the biggest trophy in club football.

Kelly: It was a similar situation with the Club World Cup with lots of people talking about PSG and the way you won that...

Reece: It was another final where we were underdogs but we all believed and knew we were good enough to come out on top. I think we showed that in the game and with the result.

Kelly: What was a typical day for you and your siblings growing up?

Reece: We would wake up and go to school. The minute we got home from school, it was kicking a ball around on the street until one of us had to go to training. Whoever was training, the other one would be kicking a ball around on the side watching. It was like that for pretty much all of my childhood, always with a ball at my feet.

Kelly: What was it like growing up with your sister Lauren? It must have been so evident from a young age how good she was...

Reece: When she was young, I didn't understand how good she was because I didn't see that many girls playing. She always played with me and boys and she was better than most of them. She has come on leaps and bounds in her career and is doing amazing things.

Kelly: I read she was training with the Arsenal women's team and was then moved to the Arsenal boys' academy. She talked about the fact that she didn't think about being any different as a girl, she was a footballer. That must have been something that playing with you and your brother must have really helped her with...

Reece: Yeah she was always playing with the both of us and that probably helped her with her technical ability and physicality.

Kelly: What's your relationship like with her now?

Reece: It's good. We live a similar life - we're playing football at the highest level. Sometimes our schedules are not aligned so we miss each other's games, but we are close.

Kelly: Do you speak a lot and see each other a lot?

Reece: I'm always travelling, she's always travelling. We speak a lot.

James believes Lewis Hamilton is "probably the greatest F1 driver to have lived"

Kelly: What does a typical day off look like for you, if you're having a day away from football?

Reece: If it's pre-season I'm not leaving the house, because I'm tired. I'd literally be in bed all day. If it's in season, I'd probably go into London with my friends, see what they're up to.

Kelly: How do you escape, because football is so intense?

Reece: When I get home, I just try not to think too much, take things in my stride.

Kelly: Fashion is a big thing for you, you like a fashion show?

Reece: I like a fashion show, yeah, depending on the time of year. Fashion is good - it's something I am interested in and enjoy.

Kelly: How would you describe your fashion sense?

Reece: Now it's a lot more chilled. A few years ago, it was a bit more edgy.

Kelly: Is that down to maturing?

Reece: Maybe boredom!

Kelly: How would your friends describe you? You come across super laid back. Would they say the same?

Reece: Most of the time, yeah. I have a sharper side as well. Not everything goes my way. Sometimes I'm not in the mood, and they see that more than other people.

Kelly: Has your personality changed as you've got older and everything you've gone through?

Reece: Yeah, a lot. I've had a lot of disappointment, setbacks. That changes the way you think and view things.

Kelly: Do you think becoming a captain has changed you as well?

Reece: Yeah, it's benefited me - it's helped me grow as a person. I need to help the younger team-mates and try and improve them as players and as people.

Kelly: How would team-mates describe you?

Reece: Why don't we pull one of them in! That would be slightly easier. They'd probably say I'm chilled as well.

Kelly: But you're not chilled on the pitch, I've seen you play. It seems like there is a very different Reece James sitting here to Reece James the captain.

Reece: I'm not sure what happens. It's all or nothing on the pitch, and then off the pitch it's like whatever happens, happens.

Kelly: Your friendship with Lewis Hamilton... he posted congratulations to you. It wasn't sent from someone just observing, it was from someone that clearly knows you. Talk to me about that relationship with him.

Reece: We're reasonably close. He's probably the greatest F1 driver to have lived. I know we play different sports, but there are many similarities. He tries to help me where he can, when I'm going through difficult spells, because he has been at a high level for longer, and he's been through more.

Kelly: How did you get to know each other?

Reece: Through a mutual friend, and then we have been in contact since.

Kelly: What are you most proud of?

Reece: Probably the trophies I have won for the club.

Kelly: Any one in particular?

Reece: I wouldn't pick, they all play a huge part together.

Kelly: Tell me something that people get wrong about you the most.

Reece: I don't know, to be honest. A lot of people say a lot of stuff. Everyone has their opinion, but it doesn't really bother me. I don't know if I see anything, I'm not really paying attention anyway.

Kelly: If you could only achieve one more thing for the rest of your career, what would it be?

Reece: To win the World Cup.

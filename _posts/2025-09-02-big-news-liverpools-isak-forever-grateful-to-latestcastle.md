The story of the biggest transfer saga of the summer

Alexander Isak said it had "been an honour" to play for Newcastle as he thanked the club's supporters in a farewell message following his move to Liverpool.

The Sweden striker joined the Merseyside club on deadline day on Monday for a British record transfer fee of Â£125m after a drawn out transfer saga.

Isak scored in Newcastle's 2-1 win over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final in March as the club won their first domestic trophy in 70 years.

However, in the summer he said he wanted to leave the Magpies and has not played for them this season.

Newcastle issued a terse 37-word statement on their website to announce that Isak had made the move to Anfield, but the 25-year-old offered a more heartfelt reflection on his time on Tyneside. 

"I want to express my gratitude to my team-mates, the staff, and above all, the city of Newcastle and all the amazing supporters for the three unforgettable years we shared together," Isak said in a post on his Instagram account, external.

"Together, we have written history and brought the club to the place where it truly belongs. 

"It has been an honour to be part of the journey, from reaching the Champions League to winning the first trophy in over 70 years. Forever grateful. Thank you, Newcastle."

Isak joined Newcastle in a Â£60m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022 and scored 27 goals in 42 appearances across all competitions last season.

He helped the Magpies win the Carabao Cup in March and they went on to qualify for the Champions League by finishing fifth in the Premier League.

Earlier this summer, Isak was left out of the Magpies' squad for their pre-season tour of Asia with what the club described as a "minor thigh injury", while it was understood he wanted to explore a move away.

He then trained alone at his former club Sociedad before Liverpool's initial bid for him was knocked back by Newcastle.

Amid continued speculation about his future, Isak released a statement in which he said promises had been "broken" by Newcastle and that their "relationship can't continue".

Newcastle said "no commitment had ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer".

However, a move has now happened after Isak remained on the sidelines and missed their opening three league games, which included a 3-2 defeat by Liverpool at St James' Park.

Experts revealed that Sam Darnold (l) and Drake Maye (r) have had great starts to the season but it's been tough for Patrick Mahomes

Nine weeks down and nine to play in the NFL, so time to take stock and reflect on the first half of the 2025 season.

No team has been really dominant this year, all of the 32 sides have had at least two defeats and most of the eight divisions are still pretty much wide open.

So just who will be contending for the Super Bowl in Santa Clara in February is still very much up for grabs - although a few sides have already played their way out of contention.

Here's our pick of the best and worst from the first half of the season.

Do Bills have blueprint to beat Chiefs? Best of NFL week nine

Bills get Chiefs revenge and 89 points in Cincinnati - NFL round-up

The bookmakers still have the Kansas City Chiefs as at least joint-favourites with Buffalo, but after the Bills beat them on Sunday the favoured Super Bowl match-up right now would be the Bills against the Philadelphia Eagles.

But they're by no means the only two standout teams in the NFL right now - quarterback Josh Allen is playing great but the Bills are still second in their division, while the Eagles have had a few dud performances early on.

However, the Eagles are the champions and have a growing lead in the NFC East, plus they made some big moves on trade deadline day so remain the team to beat.

Most of the NFL's eight divisions are wide open at the halfway stage

The Denver Broncos and New England Patriots look the most solid challengers in the AFC after the Indianapolis Colts had a nightmare on Sunday - with consistency throughout the league tough to come by.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are quietly going about their business but have a tough run coming up, while the Green Bay Packers lead the NFC North but have also thrown in some dodgy defeats against the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers.

The Detroit Lions will be thereabouts again but also need some consistency while the NFC West is stacked with contenders as the Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers all have six wins and are all in play-off spots as it stands.

The New England Patriots are well ahead of schedule at 7-2 after two successive 4-12 seasons, with new head coach Mike Vrabel's side on the joint-longest winning streak in the league with six in a row - including a statement primetime win over the Bills in Buffalo.

The Pats have the sixth best defence in points allowed and the seventh best scoring offence so are really well balanced, and second-year quarterback Drake Maye has been the most accurate passer in the league so far.

Nobody expected too much from Daniel Jones in Indianapolis but the much-maligned former Giants quarterback was superb in leading the league's top scorers for eight weeks.

It all came crashing down against Pittsburgh in week eight, with Jones doubling the team's season totals for interceptions and fumbles, so they need to show who the real Colts are as their schedule starts to hot up.

And could the tide finally be turning in Carolina? The Panthers are 5-4 and chasing a first winning season since 2017. Only one of those victories came against a side with a winning record, but it was the Packers on Sunday in what could be a statement success.

The Panthers will need to improve on their average 18.9 points a game on offence to make that more than a one-off, but the signs are positive at least.

The Baltimore Ravens have had huge injury problems, not least with Lamar Jackson, but they would still have hoped for better than a 3-5 start.

The one bright spot is that the AFC North is dodgy this year and they aren't far behind the Steelers, who they still have to play twice as two of five divisional games that could yet see them somehow rescue their season. 

Quarterback injuries to Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels have also hampered the Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Commanders in their poor returns - although even Burrow would struggle with Cincy's woeful defence.

Dallas Cowboys fans may be disappointed but would they really be surprised? While Atlanta and Houston will have wanted more than three wins at this stage.

Patrick Mahomes was hit a record 15 times in the Chiefs' loss at the Buffalo Bills

They've made the Super Bowl in five of the past six seasons, winning three, but could the Kansas City Chiefs actually miss out on the play-offs?

Their run of nine consecutive AFC West titles is certainly under threat with in-form Denver leading the way and the tough Chargers in second.

Patrick Mahomes has improved in recent weeks but losing to the Bills was a big blow, and they now have a bye week off before facing the Broncos in what is verging on a must-win.

They have to play Denver twice, the Chargers again and the 7-2 Colts as well, so currently in third in the division and outside of the play-offs as it stands, it's by no means certain they can play their way out of trouble.

It's almost unthinkable but a growing possibility.

It's all happening out west, as the AFC West has three top teams in along with the NFC West, with the Seahawks, Rams and 49ers all on six wins ahead of a Sunday where all four sides play each other.

Arizona go to Seattle after beating the Cowboys and the Rams head to the 49ers for what should be two bone-crunching games.

San Francisco have battled away despite big injury problems so you wonder how long that can last, but you wouldn't be surprised if all three of them made the play-offs.

Record-breaking Rookies

Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart became the first rookie in NFL history with a touchdown pass and rushing touchdown in four consecutive games on Sunday and continues to thrill with some of his play.

He's a great character, a fighter and a leader and could have a great future as the leader of the franchise. He's certainly fun to watch.

Bucs wide receiver Emeka Egbuka has been incredibly productive in Tampa Bay, while running backs Ashton Jeanty and Quinshon Judkins have also had fine first half-seasons in the league.

Colts tight end Tyler Warren looks to have a great career ahead of him and so far this season only Travis Kelce has more receiving yards at his position.

Reigning MVP Allen will always be mentioned given his consistency, but the likes of  Maye, Baker Mayfield and even Bo Nix have been mentioned as possibles.

Sam Darnold has been magnificent for the Seahawks so has to be up there in the conversation, while his top receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is on pace for the first ever 2,000-yard receiving season in NFL history.

Christian McCaffrey has been carrying the 49ers along and looks back to his dual-purpose best - sitting seventh in receiving, ninth in rushing and first in combined yardage. He can also score from anywhere at any time.

Jonathan Taylor is the top rusher, second behind McCaffrey in combined yards and has been a touchdown scoring machine - both of those could go close if they replicate this form in the second half of the campaign.

The Chiefs are currently outside of the play-off picture

So as it stands the Chiefs are on the outside looking in, but only a brave man would back against them finding their way in.

The Eagles look to have the most comfortable division lead, while the Bills and Patriots will fight it out for the title with the Jets and Dolphins already waving the white flag.

Baltimore looking to catch Pittsburgh could be one worth watching while that NFC West battle will be a fascinating watch down the stretch.

The Colts may already have a big enough lead in the AFC South but the Packers are not sitting comfortably at all in the tough NFC North.

It's all to play for as we head into the second half of the campaign.

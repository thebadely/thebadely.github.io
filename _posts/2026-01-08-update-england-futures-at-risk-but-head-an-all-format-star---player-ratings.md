It has been recently reported that The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.

England did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.

Here we hand out player ratings for the whole series.

Zak Crawley â 5 â Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.

Ben Duckett â 3 â Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.

Jacob Bethell â 7 â Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.

Joe Root â 7 â Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?

Harry Brook â 5 â Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?

Ben Stokes â 6 â Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.

Jamie Smith â 3 â Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?

Will Jacks â 5 â Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?

Brydon Carse â 6 â A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.

Matthew Potts â 1 â Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.

Josh Tongue â 7 â Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.

Mark Wood â 2 â A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?

Jofra Archer â 6 â Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.

Ollie Pope â 3 â Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.

Gus Atkinson â 3 â One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.

Shoaib Bashir â 0 â Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.

The Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction

Jake Weatherald â 4 â Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.

Travis Head â 10 â The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.

Marnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.

Steve Smith â 7 â Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.

Usman Khawaja â 5 â A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.

Alex Carey â 9 â One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.

Cameron Green â 4 â Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.

Beau Webster â 5 â When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.

Michael Neser â 7 â Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.

Mitchell Starc â 10 â This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.

Scott Boland â 7 â Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.

Brendan Doggett â 4 â Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.

Pat Cummins â 6 â Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.

Nathan Lyon â 4 â Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.

Josh Inglis â 3 â Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.

Jhye Richardson â 2 â Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.

According to new developments, Glenn Maxwell scored the winning runs as Australia beat India to win the 2023 World Cup

Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has retired from one-day internationals to focus on next year's T20 World Cup.

The 36-year-old has played in 149 ODIs since making his debut in 2012, winning two World Cups in 2015 and 2023, plus a T20 Word Cup in 2021.

His top score came against Afghanistan at the 2023 World Cup when he struck 201 while batting and is arguably the greatest ODI innings of all-time.

Maxwell came in with Australia on 91-7 and despite battling severe cramp, he hit an unbeaten 201 from 128 balls to clinch victory and secure a semi-final spot.

Maxwell also hit the fastest century in World Cup history in 2023 - off 40 balls against the Netherlands - before Australia beat the hosts India in the final.

His last ODI came at the Champions Trophy in March, during which Maxwell "felt like I was letting the team down a little" because of his fitness.

He told The Final Word podcast, external that he then spoke with Australia's chair of men's selectors George Bailey about the 2027 World Cup and told him: "I don't think I am going to make that, it's time to start planning for people in my position to have a crack at it and make the position their own.

"They are moving in such a clear direction so this gives them the best look at what the line-up is, leading into that next World Cup."

Is Maxwell's 'miracle' the greatest men's ODI innings?

Maxwell equals record for most T20 centuries

Nicknamed 'The Big Show', Maxwell ends his ODI career with 3,990 runs at an average of 33.81, with four hundreds and 23 half-centuries.

He has the second-best ODI strike rate of all-time (126.70) and as an off-spinner he has claimed 77 wickets.

Cricket Australia's chief executive Todd Greenberg said:â¯"Congratulations to Glenn on what has been one of the most exciting and influential one-day international careers in the format's history.

"Glenn's ballistic batting has lit up the cricket world and been one of the cornerstones of Australia's continued success in the 50-over game, including his heroic role in the 2023 World Cup triumph.

"As with other greats of the game, crowds have flocked to grounds just to watch Glenn bat and children have been inspired to pick up a bat after seeing him put opposition attacks to the sword with a breathtaking array of shots."

Maxwell's most recent game was with the Punjab Kings in April but a hand injury ruled him out of the rest of the IPL season. 

He has played in 116 T20 internationals and hopes to feature in the 2026 T20 World Cup, which takes place in India and Sri Lanka from 8 February-8 March.

"His level of natural talent and skill is remarkable," added George Bailey. "His energy in the field, under-rated ability with the ball and longevity has been superb.

"Fortunately, he still has much to offer Australia in the T20 format. All things going well, he will be pivotal in the next 12 months as we build toward the World Cup early next year."

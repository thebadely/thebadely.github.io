Experts revealed that From left: Mariona Caldentey, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Sandy Baltimore

The Women's Super League's player of the season will be crowned in one of 14 awards at the inaugural Women's Professional Game Awards on Sunday.

The winners of each award will be voted for by the Women's Professional Leagues Limited (WPLL) board, the Football Writers' Association and Football Supporters' Association.

But who has been the standout performer in the top flight? BBC Sport's women's football pundits and reporters have their say.

1. Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)

Moving into midfield, she has a bit of everything for Arsenal this season. She was without a doubt their most creative player, she was the player that drove them on, especially when Renee Slegers became manager. She showed her experience at times this season in terms of, when it mattered, she stepped up for her team and scored some really important goals and assisted big goals along the way.

2. Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea)

A newcomer to the league, we were all surprised by where she was going to play. On that left side she was a constant threat for Chelsea. Every team that played against her really struggled with her forward runs but she also showed a lot of skill, a lot of physical presence, even though she is small in stature. Her creativity on the left proved why Chelsea were champions. They were very adaptable with her position and she just got used to it and got on with it.

3. Mary Fowler (Manchester City)

Before her injury she was providing goals and assists for City. She was really in form and could play anywhere across the front line and even in midfield. It was the season when we really saw what Mary Fowler was about. She is both-footed which is very rare and also able to take corners with both feet. She can dribble, she can score, she can head.

1. Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United)

The Manchester United goalkeeper had big boots to fill when she took over from Mary Earps but she has taken on the responsibility in impressive fashion. With 13 clean sheets she has been crucial to their Champions League qualification campaign and is arguably one of the best WSL signings of the past two seasons. She has shown leadership, confidence and consistency.

2. Alessia Russo (Arsenal)

It may have been a slow start for Arsenal but since kicking into gear, England striker Alessia Russo has shown why she is regarded as one of the best forwards in Europe. She has finished joint-highest goalscorer in the league and has lifted her team in moments when they really needed her. She has played with an aura that has been lacking in previous seasons. Manchester City's Khadija Shaw would have been right up there had she not been injured for a large chunk of the second half of the season but Russo's consistency in the new year means she makes my top three.

3. Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea)

I had to have a player from the champions in the shortlist and there has been nobody more consistent for Chelsea than Sandy Baltimore. In her first season in the WSL, she has slotted into the team with ease, playing in an unfamiliar left-back role for the majority of the campaign. As well as scoring in the Champions League semi-finals, she has shown her ability on the ball and composure while playing out from the back, helping to give Chelsea a new-look way of playing under Sonia Bompastor. A special mention for Arsenal's Mariona Caldentey, who has also impressed in her first season but has arguably shone more in the Champions League than the WSL.

1. Erin Cuthbert (Chelsea)

If you talk about consistency, the player that can drive her team when they need it the most, I would say Erin Cuthbert does that in abundance for Chelsea. You saw in the League Cup final when they were playing against Manchester City, the game was running away from them and she comes on and scores the winning goal. She is an absolute standout.

2. Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)

I don't even have words to say. In terms of her technical ability, being moved from that left-hand side to more centrally, we have seen a much bigger impact from her with both goals and assists. The run they have been on I would put down to the work she has put in the middle with Kim Little.

3. Caitlin Foord (Arsenal)

Caitlin Foord is probably someone that doesn't get spoken about that much. In terms of the Arsenal press, the work that goes under the radar, her work-rate in and out of possession, she is key to the way Arsenal play and I have to give her a massive shoutout.

1. Alessia Russo (Arsenal)

She has been playing exceptionally well. She is scoring goals, she is full of confidence, she is leading from the front. She is coming into great form, especially going into Euro 2025, which is super exciting.

2. Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea)

She has transformed into a phenomenal left-back even though that is not her traditional position. She has been super influential throughout the season both in and out of possession and is a really exciting player to watch.

3. Olivia Smith (Liverpool)

Every time I watch her she has me on the edge of my seat with her ability to dribble past players, score goals and do it at such a young age with unbelievable confidence. It's what you want to see from young players that go out there, be brave and fearless, and you notice when she is not in the game.

1. Shekiera Martinez (West Ham)

The fact she has scored 10 goals since the start of the year and has only had a few months to show what she has got, the huge impact she has made since January has been unbelievable. And her goals-to-game ratio is incredible.

2. Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)

There was so much excitement about her coming in. Everyone knew about her technical quality, her ability to pick up pockets of space and play between the lines with beautiful link-up play. But I don't think a lot of fans were ready for how steely she would be, how quickly the would get up to the physical element and carry that consistently throughout the season. 

3. Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea)

Aggie has been in such great form in front of goal and looks so confident. The fact that she so quickly has gone from being up-and-coming and given a chance by Emma Hayes, to feeling like an established and important part of a Chelsea side that has gone unbeaten, is really impressive. She clearly has a really good relationship and trust with Sonia Bompastor, who has backed her in big games, but I think a lot of that goes beyond the fact she's turning into a fantastic goalscorer - and is also down to the side of her game that doesn't get spoken about enough - which is her brilliant workrate.

1. Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United)

There were big shoes to fill with Mary Earps leaving in the summer. Was Phallon Tullis-Joyce ready to step up? Absolutely. She has only conceded 16 goals in the WSL this season, she has made some huge saves in huge games. It's wonderful to see how much she has come on as a goalkeeper. Technically she is one of the best in the league and I have seen a lot of improvements over the season.

2. Olivia Smith (Liverpool)

So exciting to watch. She has been so difficult to mark, she has been Liverpool's main player in regards to goal threats. She is so young with such an exciting future. Liverpool will do well to keep hold of her and should do everything in their power to do so. It's really exciting to have her in the league.

3. Alessia Russo (Arsenal)

She has really settled into this Arsenal side and has become one of the world-class strikers that we knew she had the potential to become since her move from Manchester United. This season she has scored big goals in all competitions, she is in excellent form for Arsenal and heading into the Euros in top form which is very exciting to watch.

1. Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)

She has been the best signing in my opinion. She has scored important goals for Arsenal and showed great skill and experience, as well as being able to dictate the tempo of play.

2. Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United)

She had big shoes to fill in replacing Mary Earps but has seamlessly become United's number one. She has the joint-most clean sheets in the WSL this season and also won her first cap for the United States.

3. Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea)

She has had a great debut season and been a key player for Sonia Bompastor, who has moved her around a bit from left-back to left wing. I like her aggression and speed, while she has also demonstrated her goalscoring ability.

1. Alessia Russo (Arsenal)

She has taken her game to the next level. Her goalscoring tally says it all this season.

2. Johanna Rytting Kaneryd (Chelsea)

Her movement and energy in Chelsea's front line set a precedent from early on in the season.

3. Millie Bright (Chelsea)

She has set records this season for her club and as an individual. Chelsea have won six consecutive titles and she has been captain for all of them.

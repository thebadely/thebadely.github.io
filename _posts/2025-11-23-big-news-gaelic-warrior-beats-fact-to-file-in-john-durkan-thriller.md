It has been recently reported that Winning duo Paul Townend and Gaelic Warrior

Gaelic Warrior held off a late charge from stablemate Fact To File to win a thrilling John Durkan Chase at Punchestown.

The 13-8 winner had built a huge lead under Paul Townend by the midway point, but was pushed right to the line after a strong surge by Mark Walsh aboard favourite Fact To File (11-8).

The top two are both trained by Willie Mullins, while Sunday's strong field also contained 2025 Gold Cup winner Inothewayurthinkin, 2024 Grand National winner I Am Maximus and 2023 John Durkan winner Fastorslow.

"That was a proper horse race," winning jockey Townend told RTE Sport.

"He took a bit of a breather when he needed it and it allowed him to fill up to have a go at Mark anyway.

"[He had] a good jump at the last when it was all on the line and put his head down and rallied off the back of it. His jumping held together, which was a big help."

In soft to heavy conditions, Townend and Gaelic Warrior - the second favourite - put significant daylight between themselves and the rest by halfway, with the chasing pack given considerable work to do.

However, the leader's fast early pace proved difficult to sustain and Fact To File looked to have all the momentum after bridging the gap and hitting the front before the final flight.

But Gaelic Warrior dug deep to win by a neck on a thrilling run for home, with  Fastorslow (10-1) 29 lengths behind in third.

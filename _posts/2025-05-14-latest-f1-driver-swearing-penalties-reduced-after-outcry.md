According to new developments, The initial fine drivers will now receive is nearly 10 times less than it was

Formula 1's governing body has reduced the penalties for drivers swearing or criticising officials, following widespread outcry.

A revised version of the FIA penalty guidelines, external issued to stewards on Wednesday has removed the threat of a race ban, and dramatically cut the level of fine that can be applied.

Previously, F1 drivers could be fined â¬40,000 (Â£33,700) for a first offence, and double that plus a ban for a second offence.

Now, the initial level of fine has been reduced to â¬5,000 (Â£4,200) and the potential for a ban lifted, although "more severe penalties" may still be imposed for "very serious offences".

Previously, there were multipliers for drivers from higher-level championships - F1 drivers' fines were increased four times compared with the base level - but these have also been removed. 

The new document also differentiates between offences committed in "controlled" and "uncontrolled" environments.

This effectively differentiates between things drivers say and do within competition and in forums such as news conferences, where adrenaline and risk are not influencing factors.

It remains the case that drivers can be punished for bad language, abuse of officials, criticism of the FIA or "general making and display of political, religious and personal statements or comments notably in violation of the general principle of neutrality promoted by the FIA under its statutes".

For this latter offence, as well as any "public incitement to violence or hatred", the fine is higher, at â¬20,000 (Â£16,800).

The FIA described the development as "major improvements" to appendix B of the sporting code.

The move follows widespread criticism of the stricter approach, which was introduced in January, by drivers in F1 and beyond.

The decision to introduce the potential for heavy fines and bans was made in the wake of events last year, when F1 world champion Max Verstappen was forced to do the F1 equivalent of community service after swearing in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix. 

The drivers followed that with an open letter to the FIA asking it to treat them like "adults".

And it comes two weeks after Mercedes driver George Russell, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, called for "action" from the FIA on the matter rather than words, after president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had teased this move on his Instagram account.

Ben Sulayem said in a statement: "As a former rally driver, I know first hand the range of emotions that are faced during competition.

"I have led an extensive and collaborative review with contributions from across the seven FIA World Championships, FIA Member Clubs and other motor sports organisations.

"The improvements the FIA has announced today to Appendix B will ensure we continue to promote the best of sportsmanship in motorsport, while also giving stewards effective guidelines to act against individuals who may bring the sport into disrepute.

"The FIA will always be committed to ensuring motor sport is accessible for all our sporting family."

Ronan Morgan, president of the FIA drivers' committee, said: "Drivers are looked up to as role models by young fans and are rightly seen as ambassadors for the wider world of motor sport. How they act really does matter.

"But it is important to recognise that there is a difference between what is said during a race and in a press conference. Today's changes further strengthen the FIA's International Sporting Code supporting our drivers by understanding the pressures they face during the heat of competition."

The move will be viewed within F1 as a climbdown from Ben Sulayem, the second he has made this year.

In April, engine manufacturers kicked into the long grass his attempt to reintroduce V10 naturally aspirated engines to F1 by 2028 or 2029, before the end of the new engine cycle for revised turbo hybrids, which runs from 2026-30.

Although officially the idea is still being discussed, and Ben Sulayem remains committed to it privately, there is a blocking majority against it in F1, and it has effectively been dismissed.

This week, BBC Sport reported that Ben Sulayem was planning further changes to the FIA statutes apparently aimed at enhancing his authority and reducing checks and balances.

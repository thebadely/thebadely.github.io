Let's dive into the details: Martin O'Neill and Shaun Maloney have three wins and one defeat so far since taking charge in October

Martin O'Neill and Shaun Maloney will continue to take charge of Celtic on an interim basis, until the process to appoint a new manager is complete. 

O'Neill, who previously managed Celtic from 2000 to 2005, and ex-Celtic player Maloney, have overseen four games following Brendan Rodgers' resignation.

Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy has been heavily linked with the manager's job but the club's latest update indicates that O'Neill will remain in charge for Saturday's Scottish Premiership meeting with St Mirren in Paisley (20:00 GMT).

"If there's not an announcement now in the next few days, then I'm happy to still be here for the weekend game against St Mirren," O'Neill told Celtic TV.

"First of all, we want the players coming back from international matches unscathed, which is the most important thing for us now that we've got a few injuries to contend with.

"So whatever sort of squad we had for the Kilmarnock game, I wouldn't mind having roughly the same again, but we can only deal with what we have and what we want to do, and we just want to play as strongly as we possibly can.

"But let's see what the next couple of days bring."

After Saturday's game, Celtic take on Feyenoord in the Europa League (27 November) before league games against Hibernian (30 November), Dundee (3 December) and Hearts (7 December). 

They host Roma in the Europa League on 11 December before the Premier Sports Cup final against St Mirren on Sunday, 14 December.

It has been recently reported that Steve McNamara was appointed Catalans Dragons head coach in June 2017

Catalans Dragons have announced the sacking of head coach Steve McNamara, over a month since he last led the side.

The former England coach's last game in charge was the 40-0 Super League defeat by St Helens on 15 May, with Joel Tomkins leading the team on an interim basis in their past five games.

However, until Monday Les Dracs had not formally confirmed McNamara, 53, would be leaving his post.

During his eight years in charge he guided them to their first ever Challenge Cup success in 2018 and two Grand Final appearances.

In a statement,, external Catalans thanked McNamara for his "commitment and the success he achieved".

"After eight years, and without questioning his qualities, the Catalans Dragons have decided not to continue their collaboration with their head coach Steve McNamara - a decision that has been accepted by him," the club said.

The French side ended a seven-game losing streak with a 32-0 win over Huddersfield on Saturday and are five points off the play-off places.

They face a trip to Wakefield Trinity this weekend.

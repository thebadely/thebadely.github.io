According to new developments, Wet conditions are expected to continue for many on Saturday morning as the UK heads towards a cold snap next week.

Friday saw torrential rain across the much of the UK brought by Storm Claudia, which caused some flooding.

A Met Office yellow rain warning will remain in place early on Saturday for much of England and Wales and dozens of flood warnings have been issued.

Beyond the weekend, sub-zero temperatures are expected for some, with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issuing a cold weather alert from 08:00 GMT on Monday until the following Friday which covers the north of England and Midlands. 

Met Office chief meteorologist Matthew Lehnert said some areas were expected to see up to a month's worth of rain between Friday and Saturday.

Flood defences have been implemented in Bewdley, West Midlands, with emergency services in Shrewsbury set to follow suit on Saturday.

The British Red Cross said it had placed its emergency response teams on standby to help communities most at risk.

South Wales Fire and Rescue Service has declared a major incident in Monmouth following severe and widespread flooding across the town and surrounding area.

Some businesses and homes in the town centre are under water after the river Monnow burst its banks - some locals have been evacuated to the local library. Monmouthshire County Council has urged motorists to avoid travelling in the local area, and said officials have worked overnight with emergency services to support residents.

Friday's downpours have caused some travel disruption, with National Rail warning delays and cancellations are expected over the weekend. 

Avanti West Coast , Chiltern Railways , TransPennine Express, Northern and CrossCountry have warned services will be impacted.

The AA has advised against travelling in the "hazardous weather", saying: "Safety comes first. Conditions may change quickly, so stay updated and make sure you're prepared before you travel."

The RAC urged drivers to take the amber weather warnings associated with Storm Claudia "extremely seriously".

Some events have already been disrupted by the weather, including a Christmas event - Lapland UK - in Macclesfield being forced to shut because of falling trees.

Organisers have said they will examine the track at Prestbury Park, Cheltenham, on Saturday morning ahead of the scheduled seven-race Paddy Power Gold Cup card to decide whether racing was proceed.

Storm Claudia - named by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) - has already brought heavy rain and strong winds to Spain and Portugal.

The storm comes as the Environment Agency warned that England will experience widespread drought next year without a wet winter.

The country has received only 83% of the average rainfall for January to October, and suffered the driest spring for 132 years and the hottest summer on record.

Despite recent rainfall, the situation remains "precarious", it said.

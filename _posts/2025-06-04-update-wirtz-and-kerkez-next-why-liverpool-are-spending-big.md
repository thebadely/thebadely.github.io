Here’s what you need to know: Milos Kerkez and Florian Wirtz are two of Liverpool's summer targets

It was an extremely quiet transfer window for Liverpool last summer, with Federico Chiesa the only immediate signing that was made.

But despite the lack of additions, the Reds cruised to the Premier League title in Arne Slot's first season in charge.

This time, however, they are doing things differently. 

Liverpool have already brought in Netherlands international Jeremie Frimpong for Â£29.5m, are closing in on his Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Florian Wirtz for a fee in the region of a club record Â£109m and are in talks to sign Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez for between Â£45m and Â£50m.

There's also likely to be further incomings and outgoings to come.

After seeing his side close out their title-winning campaign with a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace at Anfield, Slot reflected on the club's lack of transfer business last summer.

Chiesa arrived late in the window and while the Reds did also agree a deal to sign Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, he stayed with the Spanish side until this summer.

"We did things differently," he said. "Apart from signing Federico Chiesa we didn't do a lot so that makes it maybe even more special."

If the lack of transfer activity made for a "special" title win, why the change of tack?

"It will be just as tough or even tougher next season because the clubs we've competed with this season have always in every window invested a lot of money and they will probably do so this summer as well," Slot added.

"We just want good players. Ideally you sign them as soon as you can but it is not always easy."

The arrival of Wirtz and Kerkez would take Liverpool's spending to around Â£180m already, with a mini-transfer window having opened earlier than usual because of the Club World Cup.

But, while some clubs are taking advantage of the early window due to playing in the tournament or to meet Profit and Sustainability requirements, the Reds are simply attempting to do their business quickly as the best preparation for the new season.

"Liverpool have been outside of the top 10 spenders on player signings since 2019, but their model is a classic case of being smarter rather than bigger," says football finance expert Kieran Maguire.

"They certainly have the capacity to spend Â£200m but whether that fits with their model is another matter."

This is also a first proper summer transfer window for sporting director Richard Hughes, who joined the Reds in March last year.

At that time his immediate task was identifying and appointing Jurgen Klopp's successor but his full focus now, with more than a year to prepare, has been on player recruitment.

Given how much the Reds have spent already, there is every chance they will spend the Â£200m Maguire mentions, with several positions still being targeted as areas to strengthen.

Liverpool moved quickly to address the departure of full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold with the signing of Frimpong, who can play anywhere down the right-hand side.

Wirtz, meanwhile, is seen as a key acquisition for Slot, which is why Liverpool are prepared to pay a club-record transfer fee for him.

Manchester City - Liverpool's likely main challengers for the title next season - had also been interested in the Germany international, having viewed him as a successor to Kevin de Bruyne.

But Pep Guardiola's side were ultimately put off by the potential cost of the deal, leaving Liverpool to press on. 

Left-back is also an area Slot wants to strengthen with Milos Kerkez - who plays for Hughes' former club Bournemouth - a key target.

No agreement has yet been reached between Liverpool and Bournemouth, but the Reds have stepped up their efforts to sign him over the last couple of days. 

Hughes was Bournemouth's sporting director when Kerkez moved to the South Coast from AZ Alkmaar in 2023.

The Hungary defender dropped a small hint over his future on Instagram recently, posting: "I don't know what will happen in the next week but Cherries family thank you!"

Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport: "Kerkez from Bournemouth is a really good option. He's quick, he's got good feet, likes defending one-on-one. He is very tenacious, great energy, and is only 21. 

"It fits the criteria of Liverpool's recruitment team measured by ability to progress and become more of an asset. I think that's quite likely to happen."

The left-back ranks second for most distanced covered of all Premier League full-backs this season (behind only Fulham's Antonee Robinson) and third for most sprints.

He has made the third-most open play crosses in the Premier League and has eight goal involvements this campaign (two goals and six assists).

His arrival would raise questions about the future of Andy Robertson and Konstantinos Tsimikas, with the Reds unlikely to need all three left-backs next season.

Tsimikas would be the expected departure but, with Champions League interest in Robertson, his exit instead is a possibility.

Liverpool were also one of a number of Premier League clubs interested in Bournemouth's Dean Huijsen before his move to Real Madrid was confirmed, so a centre-back may also be on the radar, particularly as Ibrahima Konate is into the final year of his contract with no news on a new agreement.

A new striker could also be pursued, although that will likely be dependent on outgoings in that position.

Darwin Nunez (5) and Luis Diaz (13) scored 18 Premier League goals between them last season

Slot could be tempted to refresh his attack and both Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez have been linked with moves away.

Diaz joined the Reds in 2022 but enjoyed his best goalscoring form under Slot with 17 in all competitions including 13 in the Premier League.

However, potential summer moves to either Barcelona or Saudi Arabia have been touted, and speculation over his future has only increased after Diaz and his girlfriend both wrote lengthy posts on social media to Liverpool fans that could be interpreted as farewell messages.

Meanwhile, Nunez has struggled to start regularly under Slot, who has also made public criticisms of his attitude.

He has had three full seasons at Liverpool since completing a move worth up to Â£85m from Benfica - and while his effort is praised by Liverpool fans, he has struggled to score consistently.

"It's time for a freshen up in attack," added Murphy. 

"I think Darwin has had a lot of chances. If you just simplify it to what we've seen in terms of his contribution and minutes played, Slot obviously doesn't fancy him.

"Slot has played a winger, Luis Diaz, ahead of him as a striker at times. That tells you everything you need to know.

"I would be amazed if Darwin stayed. I think the writing is on the wall for him."

Another player whose future is unclear is Harvey Elliott. 

The midfielder made 18 Premier League appearances for the Reds last season but started just two games and recently suggested his future is uncertain by saying "you never know what's going to happen".

Goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher has already departed the Reds to join Brentford, and a busy summer of incomings and outgoings is set to continue for a while longer yet.

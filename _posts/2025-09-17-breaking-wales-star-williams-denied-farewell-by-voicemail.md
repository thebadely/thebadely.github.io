Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Wing or centre Rhys Williams made his Wales debut in 2008

Wales' most-capped rugby league player Rhys Williams believes he has been denied the send-off he deserved after being told by voicemail he would not get an international farewell.

The 35-year-old from Mold, who scored a record 24 tries for his country in 38 appearances, announced on Monday that he has retired.

Williams' season with Widnes Vikings was ended by sciatica but the wing or centre would have been fit for Wales' fixtures against Ireland at the end of October and start of November.

However, new head coach Paul Berry has opted to use those fixtures in Neath and Featherstone to look to the next generation in the cycle towards the 2030 World Cup.

Williams wanted to end on his terms but learnt that his international career, which started in 2008, was over on his answerphone.

"I had a voicemail on Saturday evening, saying that I had been dropped from the squad [as] he wanted to promote youth," he said.

"He said to give a call back if I wanted to discuss that, so I called back immediately. It rang through and then I left a message that got two blue ticks.

"He rang me back the next day and I said that I felt I shouldn't have been informed that in that way after representing my country for 17 years."

Wing or centre Rhys Williams won 38 Wales caps and scored 24 tries

Williams made his debut for Warrington in 2010 and has had spells with Crusaders, Castleford, Salford City Reds, Swinton Lions, London Broncos and Central Queensland Capras in Australia.

He moved to Widnes in January and scored 12 tries in 16 appearances this season for the Championship club.

"I wanted to retire this year off the back of playing for Wales," said Williams, who had discussed a contract extension with Widnes but opted to focus on his career as a PE teacher in Congleton.

"Like any sports player, if there was a young lad coming through who I felt was better than me then I'd tip my cap and wish them well.

"That happened to me when I was at Salford but I feel that my form was good this year.

"I feel that I have dedicated my career to Wales so to be left a voicemail like that blew my mind.

"I get that it was going to end at some point and I could take it on the chin, but it to happen like that has been incredibly disappointing."

Williams, who won his first cap against England as a teenager in 2008, is frustrated at the end to his international career but has fond memories to look back on.

"There was making my debut, which was very much unexpected at the time, winning European Cups and getting into the Four Nations, but generally it's been meeting the people I did," he said.

"There have been some great people involved with Wales Rugby League over the years who have kept it on its feet and I think we managed to create a great culture through the coaching staff and players."

Wales prop Gil Dudson won the double with Wigan in 2013

Wales have a new boss at the helm after Berry succeeded John Kear and they will also have a new-look squad.

Prop Gil Dudson, who spent the season with Oldham, has also announced his retirement.

"Pulling on the jersey and representing my country has been one of the greatest honours of my life," the 35-year-old, a double winner with Wigan in 2013, posted on social media.

"The highs, the challenges, the friendships and memories will stay with me forever.

"While this chapter comes to a close, I look forward to what's ahead and continuing to contribute to the game in new ways."

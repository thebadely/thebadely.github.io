Experts revealed that Alice Harvey claimed two defensive rebounds for Loughborough Lightning

Loughborough Lightning produced a dominant display to beat London Mavericks 79-58 and move top of the Netball Super League.

Lightning, who have won three of the previous four Grand Finals, were in control throughout and opened a 23-12 lead at the end of the first quarter.

That set the tone for the contest, with Samantha Wallace-Joseph finishing with 24 goals for the victors, and Ella Clark and Berri Neil also impressing with 14 and 13 goals respectively.

Emily Andrew contributed 24 goals for the Mavericks, who remain fourth with one round of fixtures remaining before the play-offs. 

Birmingham Panthers won 75-69 in the opening match of the round on Thursday, with third-placed Manchester Thunder hosting second-placed London Pulse on Saturday (17:00 BST).

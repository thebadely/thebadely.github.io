Let's dive into the details: Rob Edwards was in charge of Luton Town for 103 games

Middlesbrough have appointed ex-Luton Town manager Rob Edwards as their new head coach.

Edwards, 42, moves to the Riverside Stadium on a three-year deal as the replacement for Michael Carrick, who was dismissed earlier this month.

He led Luton to the Premier League in 2023 but could not avoid relegation from the top flight 12 months later and was then dismissed by the Hatters in January when they were 20th in the Championship.

His job is now to improve a Boro team who ended last season in 10th place, four points outside the play-off spots.

"It's a real privilege to be given the opportunity to be head coach of this great football club," Edwards told the club website., external

"It's something that's not lost on me, how big this is, how important this is, and what it means to people. There is an amazing fanbase."

He added: "It felt instantly that this was right for me and it got me excited. If I was going to come back in, I wanted to come back in at a place where we had a chance, and we have a really good chance here.

"We have a brilliant owner who historically gives his coaches time, support, and the tools needed to try and be successful. I can't wait to get started now."

After guiding Forest Green Rovers into League One for the first time in their history in his first EFL post, having managed AFC Telford United in National League North and worked at age-group level for Wolves and England, Edwards moved up to the Championship with Watford in the summer of 2022.

He did not last long at Vicarage Road - 11 games to be precise - but their loss was Luton's gain.

Pitching up at Kenilworth Road in November, six months later he had guided the Hatters to the Premier League by beating Coventry City in the play-off final at Wembley.

Returning to the top flight for the first time in 31 years was a huge step up for the whole club, but despite the challenge, Luton's relegation was only confirmed on the final day of the season.

Dropping back into the Championship proved a struggle, especially away from home, where they suffered 10 successive defeats and reluctantly the club and Edwards parted ways.

However, because of his success in taking Luton up, his stock has remained high.   

It is now eight years since Middlesbrough were in the Premier League and they have become stuck in the second tier.

Last season was especially painful as they watched on as their north east rivals from up the A19 enjoyed seasons to remember, with Newcastle United winning the Carabao Cup, ending a 56-year wait for a major trophy, and Sunderland securing a dramatic promotion to the Premier League. 

Edwards is now the eighth manager or head coach employed since 2017 and in only two of the eight seasons since then have they reached the play-offs.

They did finish fourth in Carrick's first season two years ago, but the direction of travel was down in the subsequent two campaigns as they ended eighth and then 10th.

Now the former Wales international is tasked with galvanising and re-energising a club and its support to try to compete at the top end of the division.

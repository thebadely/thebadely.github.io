Let's dive into the details: A man from the Republic of Ireland has been killed in an underground explosion at a mine in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), according to RTÉ News.

Emergency services were called to the Endeavor mine at Cobar, about 700km (435 miles) northwest of Sydney in the early hours of Tuesday.

Irish broadcaster RTÉ is reporting Ambrose Patrick McMullen, aged 59, from Cootehill in County Cavan, was one of the two people killed.

It is understood Mr McMullen was married with children.

NSW Police said two women, both in their 20s, were brought to the surface following the explosion, but one of the women later died.

Cavan Fine Gael councillor Carmel Brady said she was in the same year at St Aidan's Comprehensive School as Mr McMullen, who was known as Ambie.

"He was a kind, friendly young man, who excelled at all sports," she said.

"He left Cootehill in the mid '80s to travel and found a new home and life down under in Australia."

Fatalities from mine explosions are rare in Australia, with the most recent death happening in 2015 at a mine in Queensland, according to Safe Work Australia.

Cobar Mayor Jarrod Marsden said it was an "absolutely tragic" situation.

A report will be prepared for the coroner and an investigation into the incident will be carried out by the state's workplace safety authority.

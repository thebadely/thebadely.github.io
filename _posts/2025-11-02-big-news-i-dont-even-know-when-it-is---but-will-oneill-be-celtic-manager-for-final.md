O'Neill on prospect of him leading out Celtic for League Cup final

Will Martin O'Neill still be in charge of Celtic when the Scottish League Cup reaches its conclusion next month? Or will the holders have a different man in charge for the quarter-final, semi-final and final of this season's competition?

"I don't even know when the final is," the interim manager said after guiding his side to a 3-1 extra-time win over 10-man Rangers at Hampden.

If almost any other manager admitted such blissful ignorance, people would think they were at it. But not 73-year-old O'Neill.

The Northern Irishman - who was given 10 minutes to agree to a return to Parkhead on Monday - said earlier in the week he didn't really know what fixtures awaited him when he began his second stint in charge of Celtic, 20 years after his first. 

Falkirk were first up on Wednesday. Then Rangers on Sunday. His 28th Old Firm game... and, at the end of a chaotic contest, his 17th win.

Afterwards, O'Neill said he'd "secretly" love to still be in charge by the time of the final against St Mirren on 14 December.

But he did reiterate his belief that the club will be making "inroads" for a permanent replacement in the upcoming international window.

Time wil tell but, for now, he can reflect with satisfaction on a win that he reckoned aged him 20 years and in which he managed to avoid looking like Robin Hood...

We'll get to the Robin Hood comparisons in a moment, but first mention must go to O'Neill's merry men.

One week ago, when Celtic had just been comfortably dispatched by Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts, the squad appeared devoid of imagination and intent.

In what proved to be his final interview, Brendan Rodgers insisted he was more motivated than ever to turn their fortunes around. Just over 24 hours later he resigned.

O'Neill, at incredibly short notice, answered the call to pick up the pieces. 

In Celtic's swashbuckling four-goal rout of Falkirk midweek - his first game back on the touchline - there was a unity and urgency that had been absent in recent teams. 

But with all due respect to John McGlynn's side, the true test was against Danny Rohl's somewhat rejuvenated Rangers.

Celtic passed the first half with flying colours. They were one goal to the good at half-time and had a man advantage after a lively attacking display.

But "a loss of impetus" in the second half allowed the 10 men of Rangers to roar back, force extra time, and add a few years to an already elderly statesman.

"It was an incredible game," O'Neill told BBC Scotland. "We were terrific and got the goal in front and got one disallowed for offside.

"We were in command, but I was saying to [assistant] Shaun Maloney we needed a goal to kill the game off and six or seven minutes later, Rangers get the penalty.

"I was 73 on Monday... I'm 94 now!"

'Is this what we're going to get from Celtic every week now?'

Once the initial shock at his return passed, many Celtic fans will have been pleased to see the club legend return.

The Celtic powerbrokers, who have been engulfed in heat from the fans, knew what they were doing with this one. 

O'Neill was even able to tip Hearts for the title - and stand by his prediction - and not have his reputation tarnished. 

Even if things hadn't gone to script on Sunday - or at any stage during his interim tenure - his place in club folklore is fixed. But a semi-final victory against Rangers has certainly lifted spirits. 

Supporters sought out the songbook from two decades ago and serenaded him at the national stadium. It was just another surreal moment in a surreal week. 

O'Neill doesn't have the same calibre of player to call upon as he did in his first spell. There is no Lubo Moravcik, no Neil Lennon, no Henrik Larsson. 

But there is a group of players keen to prove their worth.

Outside of the aforementioned Callum McGregor and Kieran Tierney, the four others involved in Celtic's goals - scorers Johnny Kenny and Callum Osmand - who has been advised to "get a couple DVDs of the Swede" - and providers Arne Engels and Auston Trusty - were latterly not favoured by Rodgers.

Whether O'Neill sticks around for the final or not, he has at worst provided a path for players who otherwise might have been rocking up suited and booted and seated in the stands. 

On that note of attire, the final mention in this mad week must go to O'Neill's matchday fit.

The sight of him adorning an Adidas Originals tracksuit on the touchline was as surprising as anything else out of Parkhead this week.

"The other tracksuit was really tight nylon," explained O'Neill of what he wore against Falkirk. "I looked like Robin Hood!"

A vintage look for a vintage manager, who might just be breaking out the shirt and tie and circling 14 December on the calendar.

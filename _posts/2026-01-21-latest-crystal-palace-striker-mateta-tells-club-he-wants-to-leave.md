Experts revealed that Mateta has scored 54 goals in 177 appearances for Palace

France striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave amid interest from other Premier League and European clubs.

Mateta, 28, has 18 months remaining on his current deal at Selhurst Park and as things stand he will not be signing an extension.

Italian giants Juventus have tried to sign the striker this month but have so far failed to reach Palace's valuation, which is believed to be around Â£40m.

Aston Villa, who have been keen on Mateta for some time, have also shown interest in a move this month.

Speaking last week, Palace manager Oliver Glasner admitted the club are listening to offers for Mateta.

"There will be a price that Crystal Palace [accept], with 18 months left on his contract. We'd do the deal, if JP wants. If nobody pays that price, then he will stay," said the Austrian.

Palace, who won the FA Cup in May, sold star midfielder Eberechi Eze to Arsenal in the summer and have lost captain Marc Guehi this January, after he joined Manchester City in a Â£20m deal.

Glasner, who announced last week that he will leave the club at the end of the season, launched a scathing attack on the Palace hierarchy following Saturday's loss to Sunderland - claiming the team had been 'abandoned' by the club's recruitment strategy.

Palace were knocked out of the FA Cup at non-league Macclesfield in one of the tournament's greatest shocks earlier this month.

The news will be a blow, but not a surprise to supporters of the club. 

Mateta, since his remarkable upturn in form over the past 18 months, has always made clear his desire to play at the highest level and has aims of playing in the Champions League and representing France at the World Cup. 

The 28-year-old's World Cup dream, one that seemed distant before Glasner's arrival at the club, is one that can be achieved now after making his senior debut in October while the frontman has scored in his last two appearances for Les Bleus. 

Sources with knowledge of Mateta's situation say the player is disappointed with the club's attitude because it has not kept its promises in terms of a new contract, recruitment and ambition, with the forward keen on a new challenge. 

The timing compounds a difficult period at Selhurst Park given Guehi's departure, Glasner's forthcoming exit and the FA Cup embarrassment.

Palace are also winless in 10 matches and are still without key right wing back Daniel Munoz who is injured while Daichi Kamada is also on the treatment table. 

Ismaila Sarr, a key forward alongside Mateta in the Eagles attack, has missed nine games while he has been helping Senegal win the Africa Cup of Nations. 

Mateta himself is playing through a knee injury but his track record of scoring in the Premier League will make him an attractive option to clubs. 

Palace made a club record signing in bringing Brennan Johnson to south London early in January from Tottenham but will need to be active before the transfer window closes on 2 February if they are to turn around what has been a challenging start to the year.

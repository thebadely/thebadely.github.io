It has been recently reported that Oscar Bobb missed almost the whole of last season with a fractured bone in his leg

Fulham are in talks to sign winger Oscar Bobb from fellow Premier League side Manchester City.

The 22-year-old has fallen down the pecking order under Pep Guardiola following the Â£62.5m signing of forward Antoine Semenyo this month.

Sources have told BBC Sport talks have taken place between the two clubs, but the Cottagers have yet to make a formal offer.

Bobb, who has also had interest from Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, has featured 15 times for City this season without scoring.

He last played on 17 December against Brentford in the Carabao Cup, when he hobbled off injured inside the opening 20 minutes.

City face Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League group phase on Tuesday and when asked about Bobb's injury, Guardiola replied: "He says he is not fit, so he is not fit."

Semenyo's signing adds competition on the right wing, where Brazilian Savinho also plays, meaning Bobb may well be allowed to leave this month either on loan or a permanent transfer.

Fulham have lost only one of their past seven games under Marco Silva, sitting 11th in the table and progressing into the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Bobb has featured six times for Norway this year, helping them qualify for this summer's World Cup, and would unite with compatriot Sander Berge at Craven Cottage.

He missed almost the whole of last season after fracturing a bone in his leg during training in August 2024.

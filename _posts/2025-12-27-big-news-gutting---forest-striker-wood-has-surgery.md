Here’s what you need to know: Chris Wood joined Nottingham Forest from Newcastle United in 2023, initially on loan before singing on a permanent basis that summer

Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood is set for a further spell on the sidelines after having surgery. 

The New Zealand striker has been out since mid-October with a knee problem and is yet to feature under Sean Dyche since he replaced Ange Postecogolou as manager. 

The 34-year-old excelled at the City Ground last term, scoring 20 times in 40 appearances as they qualified for Europe.

His playing time has been more limited this campaign, with Wood having managed two goals in nine appearances.

Wood did not specify the nature of his surgery, but he has been seen wearing a knee brace while watching recent Forest matches. 

"The Christmas I didn't expect, you can never know what football throws at you," Wood wrote on Instagram.

"From the highs of last season to now the battles and the lows personally of this season. You have to be ready for anything. 

"Truly gutting and frustrating that I'll be on the sideline for another period of time. It's what's needed to come back stronger and better to help my team-mates do the job needed in the Premier League and in Europe."

Wood's last appearance came in Postecoglou's final game in charge, the 3-0 defeat by Chelsea on 18 October.

According to new developments, Pat Cummins was the first fast bowler to take on the role of full-time Australian captain

Any absence of Australia captain Pat Cummins from the Ashes could play into England's hands, according to batter Harry Brook.

Australian media have reported pace bowler Cummins will miss the first Test because of a back injury and could be forced out of the entire series.

Head coach Andrew McDonald said he is "optimistic" Cummins will be fit for the first Test but admitted time is getting "tight" for the 32-year-old to line-up in Perth on 21 November.

Speaking at the Professional Cricketers' Association awards, Brook said: "With him out of their side for the first game, from what we've seen, hopefully that plays into our hands.

"Obviously he is an amazing bowler and has been for many years; he bowls at high pace with high skill.

"But they have a lot of good bowlers, quick bowlers, so we can't take anybody lightly."

Cummins, one of the premier fast bowlers in the world, has not played since July because of lumbar bone stress in his back.

If and when the injury heals, the Australia skipper would still need time to gradually increase the intensity of his bowling, a period which McDonald admitted would take at least four weeks. The first match in the five-Test series is six weeks away.

If Cummins is ruled out for part, or all of the Ashes, Scott Boland - who famously took six wickets for seven runs on his Test debut against England in Melbourne in 2021 - would step in to join Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc in the Australia pace attack. 

Given those three men are well into their 30s and five intense Tests are crammed into seven weeks, the home side would probably have to dip into reserves like Michael Neser, Brendan Doggett and Sean Abbott.

"They have got lots of amazing bowlers so I'm sure they'll draft someone in who is very skilful," Brook told BBC Sport.

Labuschagne boosts Ashes case with another century

England have a fitness concern over their own captain, after Ben Stokes missed the final Test against India in July with a shoulder injury.

All-rounder Stokes, 34, is expected to be fit for the first Ashes Test, but has not played a full role in any of England's past four series because of various injuries.

Brook, England's white-ball captain, has been promoted to Test vice-captain for the Ashes tour and would lead the tourists if Stokes misses any of the series.

But the 26-year-old said he is not "biting at the bit" to captain England in an Ashes Test and expects Stokes to play in all five matches.

"I think he'll power through even if he has a little niggle," said Brook. "I have full faith that he is going to be there. Everybody in the world knows what he's like, his character and the way that he just cracks on.

"Obviously, being captain would be a massive honour. But I would much rather Stokesy played five Test matches; he's such a vital part of our team, batting at number six and bowling the overs that he does. For him to play all five Tests would be awesome for us."

Brook's promotion has ended Ollie Pope's spell as Stokes' deputy, a role he has filled since 2022. England director of cricket Rob Key explained the decision was made because Brook is a "better leader".

Brook admitted he had an "instinct" the change was going to come before it was made official and that he has been in contact with Pope.

"I dropped him a couple of messages a couple of weeks ago, talking about golf mainly," said Brook.

"I don't think he's too bothered; he's just happy to still be in the squad. He is a vital part of the team, batting at number three, and we all know how valuable his runs are."

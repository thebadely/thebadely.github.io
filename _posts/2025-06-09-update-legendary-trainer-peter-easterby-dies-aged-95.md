It has been recently reported that Easterby retired in 1996 after a distinguished career

Legendary racehorse trainer Peter Easterby has died at the age of 95.

Easterby, based in Malton, North Yorkshire, saddled equine greats Sea Pigeon, Night Nurse and Little Owl to big-race victories.

He was champion jumps trainer three times, won the Champion Hurdle on five occasions and the Cheltenham Gold Cup twice.

The figurehead of a renowned racing family, he was the first British trainer to have more than 1,000 winners on both the flat and over the jumps.

Easterby, whose brother Mick is also a successful trainer with his own son David, retired in 1996 when he handed his training licence to son Tim.

"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of my father Peter Easterby," said Tim.

"He passed away peacefully in his own home with his family by his side. A true gentleman, legendary racehorse trainer, passionate farmer, lover of country sports and an incredibly proud father and grandfather."

While Sea Pigeon won both the Champion Hurdle and Chester Cup twice, Easterby said the biggest cheer he heard was was when the horse won the Ebor Handicap on the flat at York in 1979 when carrying the top weight.

"The announcer got 'Sea' out and you couldn't hear the other word 'Pigeon" because there was such a roar, so that was very exciting," he recalled.

Night Nurse was another two-time champion hurdler, who was narrowly denied a Cheltenham Gold Cup triumph in 1981, by stablemate Little Owl.

Easterby had also won the Gold Cup two years earlier with Alverton, who was then sent off favourite for the Grand National but died after a fall at Becher's Brook.

He held a training licence for 46 years, sending out more than 2,500 winners and claimed his first Champion Hurdle with Saucy Kit in 1967.

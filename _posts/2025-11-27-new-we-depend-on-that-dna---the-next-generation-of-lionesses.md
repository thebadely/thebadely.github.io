Experts revealed that Izzy Goodwin has scored three goals in nine WSL appearances this season

The Lionesses have won back-to-back European titles - but can the youngsters coming through replicate their success?

It's a big question for the Football Association, who have reshaped the pathway in recent years to try to get the best out of England's young talent. 

Boss Sarina Wiegman has so far called up 20 players from the youth teams during her four-year spell in charge, handing caps to 12 of them.

They include midfield regulars Grace Clinton and Jess Park, as well as attacking stars Aggie Beever-Jones and Michelle Agyemang. 

England Under-23s beat Norway 1-0 at Manchester City's Joie Stadium on Thursday night - and there was plenty of talent on show.

While the senior squad prepare to end a year in which they lifted the Euro 2025 title, Emma Coates' under-23s are hoping to impress Wiegman and put themselves in contention for a call-up.

For friendly matches against China and Ghana this month, Wiegman brought in young West Ham defender Anouk Denton and London City Lionesses forward Freya Godfrey.

They are the latest in a long list of players who have made the jump, following Arsenal teenager Katie Reid and Aston Villa midfielder Lucia Kendall in October.

Seven players have been given the nod by Wiegman this year, including Brighton's Maisie Symonds, who started in midfield for the under-23s against Norway.

"It's such an important part of the Lionesses' DNA. We depend on that DNA coming through," England's two-time European champion Lotte Wubben-Moy told BBC Sport.

"We need young players who are competitive and are pushing not just myself, but the older players too. That's really positive. 

"When you have that competition, it allows for so much growth. We've seen that in the past four or five years - not just in terms of silverware."

Coates and her coaching staff work closely with Wiegman, having regular meetings and conversations about players' development.

The youth teams, including England's under-17s and under-19s, try to mirror the senior side with their preparation routines, match tactics and squad culture. 

Wiegman also watched an under-23s training session at St George's Park this week. 

Those who have moved up to the senior team have had huge success as a result, including Agyemang, who was one of the stars of Euro 2025.

One of the latest debutants, Villa midfielder Kendall, won player of the match after impressing in England's 3-0 win over Australia last month.

"I remember coming in full of confidence and wanting to prove myself. That can be the best position to be in as there's no expectations," said England forward Lauren Hemp, who was asked what advice she would pass on. 

"I still try to instil it now. I want to soak up every moment I get. It's not often you get to play in front of 80,000 at Wembley Stadium. 

"They are great occasions for the girls coming through."

Faye Kirby trained with Sarina Wiegman's squad this week 

Plenty in the under-23s are itching for their major break. 

Liverpool goalkeeper Faye Kirby was invited to train with the Lionesses at St George's Park this week, having recovered from the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury that kept her out for most of last year.

"I found out the morning before. I was a bit nervous but also excited. It was a bit of a whirlwind really," said the 21-year-old, who was a substitute for Thursday's victory. 

"I really enjoyed it. It gave me a bit more of an insight into what that's actually like [stepping up]. Hopefully I do that in the future.

"The under-23s work in line with the seniors so the biggest thing is probably just the speed of their game."

Perhaps the biggest star of the under-23s is London City Lionesses striker Izzy Goodwin, who scored the winner against Norway.

She remains the WSL 2's record signing having joined London City from Sheffield United in 2024 for a fee rising up to Â£150,000 - and finished top scorer last season.

"I think I'm a fast and powerful player," said Goodwin, 22. "I look up to Alessia Russo. Her hold-up play is very good and that's something I've been working on a lot. 

"She's a great player. Her ball striking is also amazing. I want to keep working and hopefully it pays off."

Also in Thursday's starting XI was Everton's Ruby Mace, who has one cap for the senior team and wore the captain's armband for the under-23s.

Manchester City's Gracie Prior had a solid game at centre-back, with club manager Andree Jeglertz watching at the Joie stadium. 

And playmaker Erica Meg Parkinson, making her debut for the under-23s at the age of 17, created several chances and shone on the night.

"I've had a lot of minutes [at City this season]. It's just building on that to show what I can do," said Prior.

"Playing at such a high level each week builds your confidence and I've brought that into this England camp."

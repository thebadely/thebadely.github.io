Experts revealed that The Premiership will switch to become the Prem from the start of next season

The Premiership - the top flight of English rugby union - will become the 'Gallagher Prem' next season as it rebrands to emphasise the physicality and intensity of the league.

The makeover will include a new orange logo which will be shown to fans, both at Allianz Stadium and watching on television, before Saturday's final between Bath and Leicester Tigers.

It is hoped that shortening the league's name will help it "talk how fans talk" and give it a less corporate, more informal feel.

Officials also believe showcasing the confrontational nature of the sport, alongside  players' athleticism and skill, will draw in new, younger fans.

The Premiership says it recorded 30% growth in fans between the ages of 18-34 between 2023 and 2024.

"The research showed physicality was a key part of the appeal of rugby," the Premiership's chief growth officer Rob Calder told BBC Sport.

"That came through very strongly, not just with existing audiences, but wider audiences as well.

"It can't just simply be that. There's got to be some light and dark to it.

"That's where the incredible skill, the incredible pace, the decision-making under pressure is so important. Precision in training and then bravery in execution.

"We want to talk about all those things."

The Prem will focus on delivering more action and behind-the-scenes content to YouTube and social media, with big hits, young stars and emotional moments showcased alongside tries and match highlights.

Its marketing push is part of a drive for growth, investment and subsequent financial security after the chastening demise of Worcester, Wasps and London Irish, who all went bust in the 2022-23 season.

The Premiership believes that a franchise system - with on-pitch relegation scrapped, but teams obliged to hit centrally-set standards on and off the pitch - would attract a flush of new money.

Switching to such an expansion model has the backing of Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney, but will need the approval of the RFU Council to become reality.

The second-tier Championship announced in May that it would similarly change its name for the start of next season, opting for 'Champ Rugby'.

The Six Nations has also recently rebranded. The tournament unveiled a new orange logo in December, with the majority of fans unimpressed.

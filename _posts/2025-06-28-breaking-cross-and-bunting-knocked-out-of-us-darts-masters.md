It has been recently reported that Rob Cross is the world number nine

Reigning champion Rob Cross and top seed Stephen Bunting suffered shock defeats on the opening night of the US Darts Masters at Madison Square Garden in New York.

England's Cross suffered a 6-0 defeat by American Danny Lauby, who had previously lost three times in the first round of the event, which is part of the World Series of Darts.

Englishman Bunting managed a 170 checkout, but American qualifier Jason Brandon won 6-4 and will next face Australian Damon Heta.

England's world number one Luke Humphries came from 4-3 down against American Stowe Buntz, winning the final three legs to set up a meeting with Lauby.

World champion Luke Littler eased into the last eight thanks to a 6-1 win over American Jules van Dongen, securing his success with a 120 checkout of three double 20s.

His next opponent will be fellow Englishman Nathan Aspinall, who won the title in 2019 when the tournament was held in Las Vegas and who beat Canadian number one Matt Campbell 6-2.

Two-time champion Michael van Gerwen returned to action after announcing last month he had separated from his wife Daphne with a 6-1 win over American Leonard Gates.

The Dutchman will next face Welshman Gerwyn Price, the runner-up in 2024 who averaged 102.47 and hit six 180s in his 6-2 win over American qualifier Adam Sevada.

Let's dive into the details: Wolves are still searching for their first Premier League win of the season 

It is certainly not the season to be jolly if you are a Wolves fan. 

No league wins this season, no points since the start of October and no goals in any of their past five matches.

The only Wolves player to score since the beginning of November is Yerson Mosquera - and that was into his own net in the 3-0 loss at Fulham.

It is the first season since 1983-84 that Wolves have failed to win any of their first 14 matches, while their current five-game streak without a goal is their longest since their debut Premier League campaign in 2003.

After Wednesday's home defeat by Nottingham Forest, Wolves have just two points from 14 matches this season, the joint-fewest at this stage of any top-flight season.

If Wolves lose an eighth league game in a row against Manchester United on Monday, it would equal the club's worst-ever run - set in 1981-82 - and would also guarantee they are bottom at Christmas.

And a failure to take any points from their next two festive fixtures - at Arsenal and home to Brentford - would see Wolves equal Sheffield United's Premier League record for the lowest points tally on Christmas Day (two, in 2020-21).

Goals have been hard to come by, perhaps no surprise given two of Wolves' three top scorers from last season - Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri - have left, while the other - Jorgen Strand Larsen - is struggling with form and fitness.

However, there are three teams in the Premier League with a lower expected goals total (xG) than Wolves' 12.74 this season.

But those three teams have all outperformed their xG, while Wolves are struggling to make the most of the few chances they are creating.

They have underperformed their xG by a greater margin than any other top-flight team (-5.74) - having only scored seven times so far.

The result is this is the first time in Premier League history a team has gone into December with none of their players having scored more than one league goal.

Any hope of a new manager bounce has been promptly dashed - Rob Edwards is yet to see a Wolves goal, let alone a point or a win.

He has only been in charge for three games since leaving Middlesbrough, but Edwards already seems to be admitting Wolves' campaign is a lost cause and that his players are playing for pride.

"It looked bleak when I arrived," he said after Wolves' loss to Forest - their 12th defeat in 14 league matches.

"We can't affect what goes on elsewhere. We can affect what we can do - but we didn't do our job tonight. We don't want to die like that. 

"That's going to be the message now going forward - we don't want to go out with a whimper."

It is a message his players need to heed or some other unwanted records could come into view - including the lows of Derby's infamous 2007-08 campaign.

The Rams were relegated from the Premier League with just 11 points, in the worst season in the history of Europe's big five leagues.

Derby's tally averaged out at just 0.29 points per game over the full 38-match campaign. 

While we are just over a third of the way through this season, Wolves are currently averaging 0.14 points per game. 

Carrying on at that pace would earn them just five points from 38 matches.

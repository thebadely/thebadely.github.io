According to new developments, Kelly Osbourne says she has lost her "best friend" following the death of her father Ozzy Osbourne.

The heavy metal pioneer died on Tuesday at the age of 76.

He died just a few weeks after performing with Black Sabbath at a big farewell show in his hometown of Birmingham.

The concert was particularly poignant for his daughter Kelly, who got engaged backstage to her long-time partner Sid Wilson, from the band Slipknot.

Many family members were at Villa Park to support the so-called Prince of Darkness for what turned out to be his final performance. 

Famous musicians such as Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones, Metallica and Guns N' Roses also took to the stage.

His band Black Sabbath are credited with inventing heavy metal. 

In 2003, the father and daughter released a cover of the Black Sabbath song Changes, which reached number one on the UK singles chart. 

In her first comments since his death, Kelly Osbourne posted the opening lyrics from the song on Instagram with a broken heart emoji: "I feel unhappy I am so sad. I lost the best friend I ever had." 

The father-daughter duo were known for having a close relationship.  

They appeared together on the MTV reality TV show The Osbournes which ran from 2002-2005. It portrayed the star as the well-meaning, frequently befuddled patriarch of an unruly household.

More recently they reprised their family podcast alongside mother Sharon and brother Jack.  

On Tuesday, the Osbourne family released a statement that said: "It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love."

They did not specify a cause of death, although the star had a series of health problems and was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2019.

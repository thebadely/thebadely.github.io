Let's dive into the details: Far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been arrested in connection with an assault at St Pancras railway station.

British Transport Police did not name Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon,  but confirmed a 42-year-old man, from Bedfordshire, was arrested over an assault in London on 28 July.

The force said the arrest took place at Luton Airport shortly after 18:30 BST on Monday, following a notification that the man had boarded an incoming flight from Faro.

The man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and will be taken to custody for questioning, police said.

The statement added he had been wanted for questioning after leaving for Tenerife in the early hours of 29 July following the incident.

Last week, British Transport Police said that a man had "serious but non-life-threatening injuries" following the incident at the railway station in King's Cross.

The force confirmed later that week that the man had been discharged from hospital.

Video footage on social media emerged shortly after the alleged assault showing Robinson walking back and forth near a motionless man lying on the floor, near the stairs down to the northbound Thameslink line. 

The clip did not show how the man ended up on the floor.

Robinson then starts coming back up the stairs, appearing to try to talk to the passing commuter who called for help.

Robinson can be heard saying: "He's come at me bruv."

Robinson was contacted by a female BBC reporter for comment after the incident, but Robinson responded with a message that said "slag".

Since the incident, Robinson has continued to post on his personal X account but has not made any comment on the arrest. 

He shared a few supportive posts shortly after British Transport Police released their initial statement on the incident.

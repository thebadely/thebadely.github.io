According to new developments, Nick Ball had never been stopped or beaten in his professional career

Nick Ball's reign as WBA featherweight world champion ended in dramatic fashion as the British boxer was stopped in the 12th round by Brandon Figueroa in front of stunned home fans in Liverpool.

After 11 closely contested rounds, in which Ball was at times typically bullish on the inside and Figueroa responded with relentless volume, the fight turned in an instant.

Seconds into the final round at M&S Bank Arena, Figueroa landed a flush straight left that sent Ball crashing to the canvas. The 28-year-old beat the count but looked unsteady, and a sharp follow-up combination forced the referee to wave it off.

Ugly scenes followed as beer and objects were thrown towards the ring after a brief altercation, with members of Ball's team unhappy about the manner of Figueroa's celebrations while the deposed champion was recovering.

"I'm sorry [for the celebration], we didn't mean anything, we were just excited. Sorry about that," Figueroa said.

"Big shout out to Nick Ball, he is a great Liverpool champion and one of the best England have ever had. I have nothing but respect for him."

In his fourth defence of the world title, Ball - who left the arena without giving a post-fight interview - suffered the first defeat of his professional career, having previously gone 24 fights unbeaten with one draw.

The result scuppers his hopes of unification bouts and brings to an end a positive run of results for British boxing on the global stage following Dalton Smith and Josh Kelly's world title triumphs in January.

American Figueroa, meanwhile, becomes a three-weight world champion in his 30th pro bout.

Figueroa stops Ball to claim WBA title from Briton - reaction

Figueroa threw 757 punches to Ball's 567

Figueroa, 29, lived up to his moniker, 'Heartbreaker', on a deflating and sorrowful night for 'Wrecking' Ball and the Liverpool crowd.

The challenger was met by a chorus of jeers on his ring walk, the 7,500-capacity arena close to full and firmly partisan. Figueroa blew kisses to his loved ones and stood calmly in his corner as the noise swelled for Ball.

The Kirkby-born fighter was given a proper hometown reception. From John Conteh to Natasha Jonas, Liverpool has never been shy of producing world champions, and Ball is the latest to have carried on that proud tradition.

The contest began at a frantic pace. Ball threw 145 punches across the opening three rounds - including sharp uppercuts in the first and second â with Figueroa throwing 204 times.

At just 5ft 2in, Ball conceded seven inches in height but dismissed the idea that was a disadvantage beforehand, insisting he preferred "punching up" at taller opponents.

As blood trickled from the champion's nose and reddened his mouth, Figueroa continued to press and appeared the fresher man at the halfway mark.

Ball responded with a blistering flurry in the eighth. Figueroa winced, smiled and fired back to the body. With some tight rounds, the fight felt finely poised and destined to go to the scorecards.

"Championship rounds. This is your territory now," Ball's corner told him.

There was nervousness in the arena, but nobody predicted such an abrupt ending.

With Ball scrambling on the floor after the initial left, he admirably rose on the count of nine. 

But Figueroa sensed the finish and unloaded - a left-right-left combination completing the job for the Texan.

During the melee that followed the stoppage, Andrew Cain, a member of Ball's team who won his own fight on the undercard, appeared to aim a kick at one of Figueroa's cornerman.

Tensions were calmed quickly, and scorecards revealed the knockout was the icing on the cake for Figueroa, who was ahead of two of the three scorecards at the time of the stoppage.

Ball could go straight back into a world title opportunity or seek a rematch

Ball has come a long way since making his professional debut in a Liverpool nightclub and had won four fights in a row since his controversial split draw with Rey Vargas in March 2024.

Of all reigning male world champions from Britain, he was the only one to have defended his title.

But that run has come to an end in the most disappointing fashion.

Ball's fan-friendly style had made him one of the country's most watchable fighters, with unification bouts and big-name opponents on the horizon.

A potential super-fight with Japan's pound-for-pound star Naoya Inoue, the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, had also been on Ball's wishlist.

Instead, Ball ran into an inspired Figueroa and must now process both the first defeat of his career and the loss of his world title.

How he responds - physically and mentally - will shape the next chapter, and overcoming this setback may prove a defining test of his character.

Bruce Carrington (WBC), Angelo Leo (IBF) and Rafael Espinoza (WBO) hold the other world titles in the division, but would any of them be eager to step in with Ball when he has no world title to offer?

Ball could seek a rematch with Figueroa, although the American might be reluctant to take that option after his knockout win.

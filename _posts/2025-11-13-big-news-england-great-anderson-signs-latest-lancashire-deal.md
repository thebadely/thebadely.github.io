Let's dive into the details: James Anderson captained Lancashire in the County Championship in 2025

James Anderson has said he still has "plenty to offer" having signed a one-year deal to remain with Lancashire at the age of 43.

The England great will extend his playing career beyond his 44th birthday as a result of his new contract.

Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, retired from international cricket in 2024 and continued with the Red Rose in 2025.

He took 17 wickets in six County Championship matches and 20 wickets in the T20 Blast, guiding Lancashire to Finals Day.

"I still get the same buzz walking out at Emirates Old Trafford that I did when I made my debut," he told the club, external.

"I've really enjoyed my cricket this year and still feel like I've got plenty to offer. I'm as hungry as ever to perform and contribute to the team's success across both red and white ball cricket.

"We've got a really talented squad with great ambitions and I'm looking forward to helping the group continue to develop, while supporting Crofty in his new role as we push for promotion and trophies in 2026."

England legend Anderson receives knighthood

Anderson's new deal means he will extend his professional cricketing career to 25 years, having made his Lancashire debut in 2001.

At the beginning of the 2025 campaign, Anderson suggested he could play three more years for Lancashire, which would take him to 2027 and the age of 45.

Following his international retirement, Anderson served as bowling consultant for the England team but stepped away from the role in summer to focus on playing for Lancashire.

"Jimmy continues to be an outstanding role model for our players, raising standards every day and it was brilliant to see the impact he made on the dressing room when he stepped into the County Championship captaincy role during the second half of last season," director of cricket performance Mark Chilton said.

"In addition to the consistency of his red ball performances, for Jimmy to come in from the cold in terms of T20 cricket and play such an effective role in our Vitality Blast campaign at 43 years of age was remarkable.

"Having him continue with us into 2026 is fantastic news for our members and supporters and a huge boost for everyone at Emirates Old Trafford ahead of next season."

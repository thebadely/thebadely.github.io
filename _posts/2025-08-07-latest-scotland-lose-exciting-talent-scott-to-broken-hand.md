Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Lucia Scott was injured against Ireland on Saturday

A broken hand has denied "exciting talent" Lucia Scott what Scotland head coach Bryan Easson predicted would be "a huge" Women's Rugby World Cup for the 21-year-old.

The Loughborough Lightning full-back is the most notable absentee from the final 32-strong squad named by Easson for the competition that kicks-off in England later this month.

The Scotland boss was "so disappointed" for Scott, revealing that she has undergone surgery for an injury picked up in Saturday's defeat by Ireland.

"She is such an exciting talent - full-back, wing, handling skills, kicking skills," Easson told BBC Scotland. "I genuinely thought she as going to have a huge World Cup."

Jones leads much-changed Ireland against Canada

But Lana Skeldon has been selected despite the Bristol hooker, who is the most-capped member of the squad on 81, leaving the field on a stretcher in the same game on Saturday.

"To get Lana Skeldon cleared after that injury is a huge relief as she is an exceptional player and is the most experienced player we've got here," Easson said. 

"When we saw her go down against Ireland, it was heart in the mouth stuff."

Bristol Bears' Elliann and Rhea Clarke have become the first set of Scottish sisters to be selected for the same Women's Rugby World Cup.

Scrum-half Rhea has just one cap but joins prop Elliann, who has played for her country 22 times, in the party for the finals.

Edinburgh Rugby/University of Edinburgh winger Hannah Walker is the only uncapped player selected.

Trailfinders second row Emma Wassell has made her way back to international rugby after recovering from a benign tumour in her chest in September.

Captain Rachel Malcolm leads a selection comprising 18 forwards and 14 backs for a Pool B campaign against Wales, Fiji and Canada.

The flanker is one of 21 players to have appeared at the previous Rugby World Cup, played in 2022.

Easson is leaving his job at the end of the tournament and added: "To go to a rugby World Cup is the pinnacle for any player but also anyone in our management team as well, so real excitement to go to that, but the fact that it is the last dance, it does put that little bit of an edge on it.

"I am so excited to see what this group can do and I want to finish it off as well as I can."

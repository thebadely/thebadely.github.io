According to new developments, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won seven world crowns, eight Masters titles and eight UK Championships since turning professional in 1992

Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the Masters for medical reasons. 

The 50-year-old world number eight, who won a record-extending eighth title in 2024, also pulled out of last year's event on medical grounds. 

He was due to face Australian Neil Robertson in the opening round on Wednesday but has now been replaced in the draw by Scottish Open champion Chris Wakelin.

O'Sullivan, who claimed his first Masters crown in 1995 at the age of 19, said he made the "nightmare decision" not to take part in the Triple Crown event in 2025 because he was under a lot of pressure and "lost the plot". 

The exact nature of his medical condition has not been disclosed.

O'Sullivan has cited medical reasons or the need to prioritise his mental health for his withdrawals from serveral tournaments in recent years, including the British Open, Wuhan Open and World Grand Prix. 

'The Rocket', who now lives in Dubai with his family, last competed at the UK Championship in December when he was beaten 6-4 in the first round by China's Zhou Yuelong at York Barbican. 

After his elimination, the Englishman said he was still unsure whether he would play at the Masters and would wait to see how he felt in January.

His next opportunity to play competitively in Britain will be either the Tour Championship in Manchester at the end of March or the World Championship in Sheffield in April.

This is the second year running the record eight-time champion has been forced to withdraw from the Masters on medical grounds.

And he'll be very disappointed to miss out on playing in one of his favourite tournaments. This Triple Crown event only features the world's top-16 ranked players and is one of the most prestigious tournaments to win.

O'Sullivan always receives an incredible reception when he plays at Ally Pally, and many snooker fans were looking forward to watching his match against the two-time winner Neil Robertson on Wednesday night - which was arguably the pick of the first-round action.

Robertson will now face Wakelin, who has played well this season, having already won the Scottish Open.

According to new developments, Tenants in States of Guernsey housing have reacted to no longer having to pay for carpet and floor when they move. 

Existing rules meant tenants had to pay to remove carpets on moving out, unless Housing decided it could stay - leaving floors bare for new tenants. 

Twenty five years ago, Jill had to take out a loan when she moved into States housing with her two children. 

She said it cost Â£1,000 to add flooring to her home - not including her kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms. 

Jill said the change was "amazing" and would give families "a head start".

She added: "I feel it's a really good positive thing, but it should've been made sooner."

When Jack Enticott moved in his home lacked flooring - besides carpet on the stairs.

He said: "I think [the change] is really good, everything is provided for you and you don't have to worry about it."

The Committee for Employment and Social Security said the change is expected to be introduced early next year, but will depend on sourcing and contractor availability.

Experts revealed that Lancaster departed Racing 92 in February after failing to reach the Investec Champions Cup knockout rounds

Connacht have appointed former England boss Stuart Lancaster as their new head coach on a two-year deal. 

Lancaster, who has been out of work since leaving Racing 92 earlier this year, will replace Pete Wilkins, who stepped down after Connacht's Challenge Cup exit in April. 

Having spent four years as England head coach before leaving following a disastrous 2015 Rugby World Cup campaign, Lancaster was appointed Leinster senior coach in 2016 and helped lead the side to four consecutive league titles and Investec Champions Cup success in 2018. 

Lancaster says he is "hugely excited" for the latest chapter of his career. 

"Connacht is a club with a proud identity, a passionate supporter base, and enormous potential both on and off the field, so I'm honoured and humbled to be given the opportunity to lead the professional men's team programme," said the 55-year-old. 

"I'm a firm believer in creating an environment that enables players to thrive and realise their potential, while playing a brand of rugby that inspires the community of which they represent. 

"Ever since my initial conversations with Willie [Ruane, Connacht chief executive], David [Humphreys, IRFU performance director] and the rest of the selection committee, it's clear that same belief exists here in Connacht, and that's why I'm so excited by this opportunity."

Connacht said Lancaster will have responsibility for the team's defence. His backroom team will include attack coach Rod Seib, scrum and contact coach Cullie Tucker and line-out and maul coach John Muldoon. 

"Stuart is one of the most respected coaches in world rugby and we are absolutely thrilled to appoint someone of his calibre," said Ruane.  

"He has a proven track record in developing young talent, building a high-performance environment, and most importantly, delivering success and helping teams realise their ambitions. 

"His coaching philosophy and his vision for how the game should be played, perfectly matches our own values and our own ambition."

Humphreys said Lancaster's appointment will provide a "huge boost" to rugby in Ireland. 

"With plans accelerating off the pitch around their new facilities it is a significant coup and a real statement of intent for Connacht Rugby," he said. 

"On behalf of the IRFU I am delighted to welcome Stuart back to Ireland and wish him well for the coming seasons."

Connacht endured a difficult 2024-25 season, finishing 13th in the 16-team United Rugby Championship to miss out on the play-offs and Champions Cup qualification.

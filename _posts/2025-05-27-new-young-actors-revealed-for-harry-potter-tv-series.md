Let's dive into the details: HBO has announced the young actors who will play the lead trio in its TV series adaption of JK Rowling's book series, Harry Potter.

Dominic McLaughlin, Arabella Stanton and Alastair Stout have been cast as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.

An open casting call for the roles was announced last year, and more than 30,000 children auditioned.

Showrunner Francesca Gardiner and executive producer and director Mark Mylod said in a statement that "the talent of these three unique actors is wonderful to behold, and we cannot wait for the world to witness their magic together onscreen".

The youngsters join John Lithgow as Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the school's key professors being played by Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall and Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape.

Other confirmed actors in the series include Nick Frost as the affable groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, Luke Thallon as professor Quirinus Quirrell and Paul Whitehouse as caretaker Argus Filch.

Further casting announcements are expected soon.

The three young actors taking on the roles played by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who starred in the hugely successful films, are relative newcomers. 

Scottish actor McLaughlin has acted in upcoming Sky comedy Grow, alongside Nick Frost and Golda Rosheuvel, and will also appear in upcoming BBC action adventure series Gifted. Stanton played Matilda in Matilda: The Musical in the West End. 

The bestselling books' author, JK Rowling, will act as an executive producer on the show, which HBO has said will be a "faithful adaptation" of her books.

The TV series, which will span at least a decade, will have more breathing space to explore the plot lines from the books without the time constraints of the film.

Filming is expected to begin in the summer at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden in the UK and the first series could air as early as 2026 on HBO Max.

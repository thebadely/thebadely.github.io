Here’s what you need to know: In 19 fights, Dalton Smith has claimed English, British, Commonwealth, European and WBC World titles

Hours after his stunning world title win over Subriel Matias at Brooklyn's Barclays Center at the weekend, Briton Dalton Smith was back on duty - this time behind the bar of an Irish pub in the heart of New York.

The Sheffield light-welterweight poured pints and led chants with the travelling supporters who had followed him across the Atlantic.

"There were lots of pints of Guinness, good celebrations and a good night with good people," the 28-year-old tells BBC Sport.

"I only had four but felt like I had about 15 though."

The following day, the Yorkshireman was standing amid the towering billboards of Times Square as he was presented with the iconic green-and-gold WBC belt, soaking in a moment that had transformed his career - and his life - overnight.

Not many outside boxing circles knew much about Smith before fight night. By Sunday morning, sports fans across the United Kingdom knew the country had a new world champion - its fifth reigning male titleholder.

"I feel like it's still yet to sink in properly now. But in a way it's not as big of a shock to me because it's something I always worked towards," Smith says.

"In the way I did it, overseas and everything against us, I feel like it made the story that much better."

BBC Sport looks at how Smith overcame the odds to pull off one of the most striking British victories on American soil.

Subriel Matias was stopped for the first time in 26 fights

Winning a world title in the United States has long been regarded as one of boxing's toughest assignments. Nearly four decades on, Lloyd Honeyghan's shock defeat of Donald Curry in Atlantic City in September 1986 is still spoken about in reverential terms.

Smith's challenge came with obstacles at almost every turn.

With 22 knockouts in 23 wins, heavy-handed Puerto Rican Matias was widely viewed as the division's bogeyman.

There was also a dark cloud hanging over the contest. Matias returned an adverse finding for the banned substance ostarine in a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association out-of-competition test in November, with a B-sample also returning an adverse result.

The New York State Athletic Commission ruled the concentration detected was below the threshold used by major boxing jurisdictions, allowing the bout to proceed.

"It's a sport where it should not be condoned whatsoever. It's dangerous enough already," Smith says. "I feel like I needed to get the win for boxing."

Exposure in the build-up was also limited. Matias' promoter Fresh Productions won the purse bid with an offer of about Â£1.5m, narrowly outbidding Matchroom's Â£1.35m.

That meant the fight was not shown on Matchroom broadcaster DAZN in the UK and was instead picked up by a pay-per-view streaming platform charging Â£41.95. By comparison, UK fans paid Â£24.99 to watch the undisputed heavyweight title fight between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk.

Smith, however, brushes away the lack of exposure with characteristic calm. "It's a shame it wasn't on a bigger platform but you play the cards you get," he says.

Fight week brought its own complications. A cancelled flight meant Smith arrived in New York separately from his team, paying out of his own pocket to travel alone.

Fresh Productions provided a fighter hotel, but Smith - concerned about "mind games" and someone playing knock-a-door run in the middle of the night - opted to relocate at his own expense.

Grant Smith joined his son in New York's Time Square to celebrate the win on Sunday 

With the odds stacked against him, it ultimately came down to Smith's self-belief.

"I thought they can try and deter us as much as they want but I'm going to smile through it because I know on Saturday night my hand will be raised and I'll become a world champion," he says.

It was the manner of victory that caught even seasoned boxing observers by surprise. Rather than boxing cautiously, Smith fought fire with fire, standing toe-to-toe with one of the division's most feared punchers.

Smith absorbed heavy shots but never wavered. In his corner was the constant presence of his father and trainer, Grant Smith.

Grant has always allowed the focus to remain on his fighter - until the emotion of the moment took over. Taking the microphone in the ring, he reeled off his son's achievements.

"An ABA schoolboy title, a British schoolboy title, an ABA junior title, a British junior title, a GB youth title, a senior ABA title, English, British outright in 12 months, European, Commonwealth and now WBC world champion, baby. That's never been done in the history of England boxing," Grant said, his voice cracking with pride.

It is no mystery where the new world champion gets his resilience from.

Nearly two decades ago, Grant survived being struck by a 56-tonne tram while out running. Left temporarily blind and deaf, he required brain surgery and was given days to live. Within weeks, he discharged himself from hospital and returned to the gym.

"My dad's had his own battles. He had his accident and that's why we've both got the tattoo on our chest - 'never give up on life'," Dalton says.

"That comes from him getting through his own adversity, and I feel like he's ingrained that in us."

Smith's WBC mandatory challenger and most likely next opponent is Alberto Puello, the Dominican Republic fighter who lost the title to Matias last summer.

He also speaks of being in "touching distance" of headlining Hillsborough Stadium, home of his beloved Sheffield Wednesday. To fill a football stadium, however, often requires the right dance partner.

One such opponent is long-time rival Adam Azim. The pair were ordered to fight in 2023 before Azim's promoters, Boxxer, withdrew from purse bids.

Londoner Azim faces Gustavo Lemos on 31 January and told BBC Sport he is targeting IBF champion Richardson Hitchins later this year, before a potential unification bout with Smith towards the end of 2026.

"It's up to Adam to earn his stripes now. He's got all my support. I want him to win a world title and set the big fight up," Smith says.

There is also a growing pull back towards America. WBO champion Teofimo Lopez defends his belt against Shakur Stevenson - two high-profile names in the sport -  at the end of the month, and Smith would happily make another transatlantic trip to face the winner.

"It's a big fight and I've earned my right to be in the biggest fights now. Bring it all on," he says.

For now, Smith is allowing himself to savour the moment - though there is still unfinished business. His promoter Eddie Hearn has promised to reward the champion with a Rolex.

"We've got a handshake, we've got a deal," Smith says. "I'm still waiting on that. I'm hoping it's a good one."

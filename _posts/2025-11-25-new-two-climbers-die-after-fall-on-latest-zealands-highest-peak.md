Here’s what you need to know: Two climbers have died after falling from New Zealand's highest peak on Aoraki, or  Mount Cook, which is known for its brutal terrain.

They were in a group of four that was trying to climb the 3,724m-high summit. The other two were uninjured and rescued by helicopter early on Tuesday, after contacting emergency services the previous night. 

Hours later they found the bodies of the dead climbers, still connected by the climbing harness. But authorities are working to recover them "in a challenging alpine environment".

Hikes to the top of Mount Cook, which towers over the Southern Alps running the length of the South Island, are difficult even for experienced climbers because of large crevasses and unpredictable weather.

None of the climbers have been publicly identified, but New Zealand media outlet Stuff reported that one of those killed was a well-known,  internationally recognised mountain guide.

Nearly a year ago three climbers from the US and Canada disappeared on the mountain. They were eventually declared dead after a multi-day search even though their bodies were never found - authorities say the search was hampered by bad weather.

Dozens of people have died trying to make it to the summit of Mount Cook. Hardly a climbing season goes by without at least one fatality, according to the New Zealand alpine club ClimbNZ.

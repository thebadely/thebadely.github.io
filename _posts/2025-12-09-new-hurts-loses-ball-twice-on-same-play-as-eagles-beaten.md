Eagles' quarterback Hurts loses ball twice on same play

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts bizarrely lost the ball twice during the same play as the reigning Super Bowl champions slumped to a third successive defeat on Monday. 

The incident happened in the second quarter when Hurts was intercepted by the Los Angeles Chargers' Da'Shawn Hand. The defensive linesman then fumbled the ball and Hurts gathered it up, only to then lose the ball again when he was tackled.

Reports from the US indicate it is the first time since records of this nature began in 1978 that a player has turned the ball over twice on the same play.

It was a chastening game for Hurts who threw a career-high four interceptions at the SoFi Stadium in California, the final one coming when Tony Jefferson picked off a pass at the one-yard line to end the game in overtime.

Cameron Dicker had earlier kicked what turned out to be the game-winning 54-yard field goal in the extra period - matching his career-high five field goals in a single game - as the Chargers won 22-19.

Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who played after undergoing surgery on a fractured hand on 1 December, completed 12 of 26 passes for 139 yards.

A fifth victory in their past six outings leaves the Chargers second in the AFC West, while the Eagles remain top of the NFC East.

Both sides return to action on 14 December at 20:00 GMT, with the Chargers travelling to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Eagles hosting the Las Vegas Raiders.

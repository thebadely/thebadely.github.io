Sixth-tier Macclesfield knock out FA Cup holders Crystal Palace

"Did that just really happen?"

Two days on from Macclesfield's stunning FA Cup third-round win over Crystal Palace, the heroics are still sinking in for manager John Rooney.

The Silkmen - who play in the sixth tier of English football - produced the greatest shock in the competition's history with a 2-1 victory over their Premier League opponents and the current holders.

"Did I ever think we would get the win and through to the next round? No, I probably didn't," Rooney told BBC Breakfast.

"There was always that bit of hope and, as it's the FA Cup, it throws up mad moments. I thought we were the well-deserved winners and credit to the lads. They were absolutely outstanding."

Rooney joined in the "carnage" celebrations in the bar after the game before leaving his players to party long into the night.

"The players enjoyed themselves," he added on the Wayne Rooney Show.

"I'm usually strict when we have a game on the Tuesday, but you have to let them enjoy that.

"When I was in the bar you should have seen it, it was nuts in there. None of them had showered, they were in their kits behind the bar pouring their own pints."

Rooney was a Macclesfield player before replacing Robbie Savage as manager in July 2025.

His older brother Wayne Rooney was part of the BBC's coverage at the Moss Rose on Saturday and was visibly moved at the full-time whistle.

After being played the clip of his superstar brother's reaction, John said on BBC Radio 5 Live: "That's the first time I've heard that back. He gets choked up watching films. He's a bit of a softie in that sense as well.

"It was a special day, especially to have him doing the game. To speak to him before and after the game means a lot.

"To have my family there as well, my wife and kids, my little lad was actually on the pitch after the second goal. He was the kid on the pitch with the players. I didn't know until I got home and watched it back. It was a surreal day."

England and Manchester United great Wayne won 11 major domestic trophies as a player - including the FA Cup - but told the Wayne Rooney Show that witnessing Macclesfield's victory was "one of the proudest moments I've had in football".

"When the draw was made I was desperate for the BBC to take the game," he added.

"I got a little bit emotional. Watching the reactions when they won and the crowd went on the pitch was a special moment.

"The thing that got me after the game, I was in the car on the way home and everyone was texting but I got a message off my mum. There were no words, it was just a picture of the two of us at the side of the pitch. You don't know how much that means to us as a family."

There could be more special moments to come for Macclesfield in this cup run.

"Fingers crossed we get a good draw tonight and get another Premier League side," Rooney said.

Macclesfield are the only non-league team left in the FA Cup and will learn their fourth-round opponents in Monday's draw at about 18:35 GMT.

There is no time for Rooney's side to dwell on their famous victory, as they return to FA Trophy action on Tuesday with a trip to Woking.

With a number games postponed due to their FA Cup run, poor weather and the recent death of forward Ethan McLeod, the Silkmen have a busy run of fixtures coming up, with eight league matches to squeeze in before their fourth-round tie takes place.

"We are back to it tomorrow in the FA Trophy," Rooney said. "We have a really busy schedule coming up. We are Saturday-Tuesday from now until the end of the season."

Sam Heathcote expected his day job to bring a reality check

Playing in the National League North, Macclesfield are part-time and defender Sam Heathcote is one of a number of players with a job outside football.

The 28-year-old has gone from battling with the likes of Brennan Johnson and Yeremy Pino on Saturday to returning to his day job as a PE teacher at Stamford Park Primary School in Altrincham on Monday.

"Straight back to it this morning, back down to reality," the centre-back told BBC Breakfast. "I'm looking forward to seeing the kids.

"I was going round school last week saying 'conceding anything less than 10 we will be happy with' and they were all laughing.

"Last time a couple of them watched it when we played in the second round against Slough and the first thing one of them said to me was 'you gave away a penalty'. They might talk about my yellow card instead of us winning. A few of them will be excited, bless them, especially the older ones that are really getting into football."

Heathcote joined the Silkmen in the summer of 2023 and has combined his teaching job with training two days a week.

He teaches children from the ages of three to 11 and hopes beating the Eagles can inspire his pupils.

"It will show that you can be an underdog in any story, you can achieve whatever you want and things that seem completely impossible might just become a reality because that's exactly what happened on Saturday," he said.

"I never thought I'd be in this position to come back in on a Monday having won that game. I still can't get over it now, it's amazing.

"I'm so happy for everyone involved to create this bit of history. We will try and milk it for as long as we can, but I know what the gaffer's like and we will be straight back to it tomorrow night."

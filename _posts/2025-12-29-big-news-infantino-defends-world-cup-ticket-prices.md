Let's dive into the details: Gianni Infantino was elected Fifa president in 2016

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has defended the cost of World Cup tickets by saying they reflect the public's "absolutely crazy" demand for next summer's tournament. 

The pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) describing it as "scandalous".

Group stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, while the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is Â£3,119.

But Infantino says the level of demand far outstrips supply.

"We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests," Infantino said at the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday.

"So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.

"In the almost 100 years of the World Cup, Fifa has sold 44 million tickets in total. So, in two weeks we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. Imagine that. This is absolutely crazy."

Fifa introduced a small number of "more affordable" Â£45 tickets for all 104 matches following criticism of its pricing structure after the initial release of tickets.

"We have listened to feedback and this new category is the right thing to do", a Fifa official close to the discussions told BBC Sport. 

Infantino says the money raised through ticket sales will be reinvested into the global game, although he did not specify an amount. 

"What's crucial is that the revenues that are generated from this are going back to the game all over the world," said Infantino. 

"Without Fifa there would be no football in 150 countries in the world. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup which we reinvest all over the world."

It has been recently reported that Liverpool's relative struggles, Mohamed Salah's form and a tough trip to Chelsea make it easy to ignore their assets and stick with red-hot Erling Haaland as captain this week.

And if you haven't already, this is your sign to load up on Arsenal players as they have the best run of any team over the next six gameweeks.

Here's your FPL team of the week.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

It was basically the Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo show, with no other player returning. A total of 53 points.

Nick Pope, Newcastle, keeper, Â£5m - Nottingham Forest (h)

Newcastle have more clean sheets than any other team (4) while Forest have scored just one goal in their past four games. 

FPL managers are losing faith in last season's surprise team.

Although they did have the most shots (22) of any team last week, it is hard to trust them away to Newcastle's solid defence - only Arsenal (3.9) have a lower expected goals conceded (xGC) than the Magpies' 4.6.

Marcos Senesi, Bournemouth, Â£4.9m - Fulham (h)

There reasons to pick Senesi.

1 - Bournemouth's defence has barely skipped a beat despite losing three key players in the summer. Consider them a good pick in general.

2 - You've probably noticed he has become the best pick for defensive contribution (defcon) points, with the two bonus points in five of six games.

3 - Fulham may be without an experienced striker, with Rodrigo Muniz and Raul Jimenez both potentially injured.

Gabriel (Â£6.2m) and Jurrien Timber (Â£5.8m), Arsenal - West Ham (h)

West Ham (h), Fulham (a), Crystal Palace (h), Sunderland (a), Burnley (a).

That's a sweet run for Arsenal and it makes sense to invest in their defenders.

Gabriel adds his obvious goal threat to a strong clean sheet chance - he was taken off before the hour mark in midweek but that looks to have been a precaution.

Meanwhile, Timber - aside from his two-goal haul against Leeds - has made nine key passes and created two big chances. No Arsenal player has more.

Dan Burn, Newcastle, Â£5m - Nottingham Forest (h)

Pick Burn for the same reasons as keeper Pope.

He's taking on a toothless Forest side and Burn has accumulated defcon points in three of six games.

Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, Â£7.8m - Fulham (h)

First name on the teamsheet at the moment. Semenyo has only failed to return in one game this season - set and forget.

Bryan Mbeumo, Man Utd, Â£8.1m - Sunderland (h)

Mbeumo is due, that's a fact! More shots than any other midfielder and only Semenyo has had more efforts in the box.

Couple that with United's league-high xG and you feel a haul coming.

Could that come against Sunderland? They have been superb defensively and kept Nottingham Forest out last week. But you still fancy United to score a couple at home - their attacking threat hasn't really been the issue this season.

Bukayo Saka, Arsenal, Â£9.8m - West Ham (h)

Saka is a bit of a forgotten man in FPL after his early-season injury, but a juicy run of games for Arsenal, starting with struggling West Ham, means he could soon be a popular pick.

West Ham's defence was not that impressive in their first game under Nuno Espirito Santo and certainly won't scare the Gunners.

Will Saka take penalties back from Viktor Gyokeres now he is fit again? He's a good pick without, an excellent choice with.

Ismaila Sarr, Crystal Palace, Â£6.4m - Everton (a)

Per start, Sarr has the highest xG among midfielders (he was seventh in that statistic last season).

He's scored in three of his four starts and takes on an Everton side whose form has dipped in the past three games - unlike Palace who are 18 unbeaten.

Erling Haaland (captain), Manchester City, Â£14.4m - Brentford (a)

It's hard to leave Haaland out of your side at the moment regardless of the opponent, but this trip to Brentford is a favourable one.

The Bees have a bottom-four defence so far, for goals conceded and expected goals conceded. Only Burnley have allowed more shots.

Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, Â£8.7m - Burnley (h)

Watkins is off the mark finally for the season and so are Villa - they surely will produce better football the rest of the way than in their first five games.

The England striker has not been great to be fair, with only nine shots this season. 

But he's facing the worst defence in the league and has the pedigree of three straight seasons with at least 15 goals, so feel confident starting him.

Karl Darlow, Leeds, Â£4m, keeper - Spurs (h)

Moises Caicedo, Chelsea, Â£5.7m - Liverpool (h)

Omar Alderete, Sunderland, Â£4.1m, defender - Man Utd (a)

Lyle Foster, Burnley, Â£5m, striker - Aston Villa (a)

Team total cost: Â£96.9m

Let's dive into the details: Woodman has been at Preston since 2022

Premier League champions Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign goalkeeper Freddie Woodman on a free transfer from Preston North End.

The 28-year-old, who made 22 appearances for the Championship side last season, is approaching the end of his contract.

Liverpool said on Friday Woodman will begin pre-season training with Arne Slot's squad next month.

With Vitezslav Jaros and Harvey Davies both out on loan for next season, Liverpool want experienced cover for Alisson Becker and Giorgi Mamardashvili, who is due to complete his transfer from Valencia on 1 July.

Liverpool sold Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford earlier this year for a fee that could reach Â£18m.

Woodman - who won the World Cup with England Under-20s in 2017 - has played for Newcastle United, Kilmarnock and Swansea City as well as Preston.

Woodman meets the criteria for an 'association trained' player so therefore does not need to take one of Liverpool's 17 non-homegrown slots on the Uefa squad list.

Woodman's dad, Andrew, is the manager of League Two side Bromley and his godfather is former England coach Gareth Southgate.

Full leaderboard

Cara Gainer shot a third-round 64 to grab a share of the lead at the Evian Championship.

The 29-year-old Englishwoman is tied at the top of the leaderboard at 11-under with Australia's Gabriela Ruffels, who shot 66.

Gainer put herself into contention to win her first major with six birdies and an eagle on the seventh hole at the Evian Resort Golf Club in Evian-les-Bains, France.

"I made a great par save on the first which really settled my nerves," she said.

"My eagle putt was definitely a highlight of the day. I hit a great drive, a great hybrid into the green about 10ft and holed the putt.

"I have good feelings and good vibes in this amazing beautiful place."

World number two Jeeno Thitikul of Thailand, three-time major winner Minjee Lee and fellow Australian Grace Kim are among those a stroke behind Gainer and Ruffels at 10 under.

English amateur Lottie Woad (70) finished with a 60ft birdie putt and is tied for 19th at six under.

The Evian Championship is the fourth of this season's five LPGA majors.

It has been recently reported that Mark Jones, Josh Adams, Filo Tiatia and Dwayne Peel could all be affected by  Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) changes this season

As Wales' four professional sides prepare for a new campaign, they have to wonder whether the 2025-26 season will be their final one.

For Welsh rugby to start in crisis is not unusual but even by its own chaotic standards, the beginning to this season is even more concerning.

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has proposed cutting the number of professional clubs from four to two, putting the futures of Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets at risk.

That radical solution is among four models being considered - with the WRU highlighting its own "optimal choice" is to halve the number of professional teams.

It has not proved popular.

The Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) has told the WRU its proposals for the elite game would "drive talent to leave Wales".

Wales and British and Irish Lions flanker Jac Morgan has told the WRU he will leave Welsh professional domestic rugby if Ospreys cease to exist.

The governing body insist no final decision has been made and has been undergoing a public consultation with players, fans and stakeholders.

An open survey on the state of Welsh rugby ends on Friday, on the first day of the United Rugby Championship (URC) season, with the official consultation process completed by the end of September.

A final decision on the future of Welsh rugby is expected by the end of October, just before Wales begin their autumn international series under new head coach Steve Tandy.

The timing is unfortunate with preparations for the new campaign affected by uncertainty and anxiety.

The four professional sides have outlined how they have been coping for the start the season with a situation that might well lead to job cuts and teams disappearing.

Following the decision to leave the Swansea.com Stadium, Ospreys will play their home matches at the Brewery Field in Bridgend this season with the permanent switch to St Helen's completed in time for the 2026-27 season.

Mark Jones' side begin their campaign with two matches in South Africa, opening up against the Bulls on Saturday.

"There is always lots going on and one thing I have learned is it's normally something close to home we have to deal with," said Jones.

"It develops resilience within your staff and players. 

"I can't compliment the group enough in how they are able to separate the two things and tried to remain focused on the job and control what we can as rugby players and coaches. They have been superb.

"I would be lying if I said there weren't moments where it infiltrates you. Individuals are human beings and there are times your mind does drift into the what-if scenario."

Jones says he has done his best to help the squad cope with the issues.

"I have tried to manage situations in an honest and upfront way, not walk passed things that need addressing and give as much clarity as I can from what I know," he added.

"Sometimes being honest is not always what you want to hear but everybody deserves to know the truth or as much of it as you know.

"There will be time to reflect on when things will be worrying, but there will be times we have to put the team and badge first and give the squad the best chance of getting off to a good start in the URC."

Peel 'can't imagine' Welsh rugby without Scarlets

Scarlets head coach Dwayne Peel will see his side open their campaign against Munster in Llanelli on Saturday. His attitude is to tackle the off-the-field issues head on.

"There's uncertainty in the game, you can't hide from that and we haven't hid from it," said Peel.

"The consultation is going on, so things are out of our control, but all we can do is be as up front and as honest with the information we've had.

"We need the clarity of how we want to approach the season because you can waste all your energy worrying about the uncertainty. 

"There are going to be elements of anxiety across the game. Every fan, player, coach, staff member of this club and other regions are going to be feeling the same."

Scarlets fans will march before the game on Saturday to show their support for the future existence of the side.

"The big thing around this club is it's the heart of the community and everything west of here is Scarlets through and through and what this place has been built on," added Peel.

"I'm not surprised by the march and the feel and love now because it's always been there. 

"In times of need, they've been there, for this club, something I feel very strongly about."

Peel says he cannot imagine the town of Llanelli or Welsh rugby without the Scarlets.

"It's been a pivotal club and entity in this country," he said. 

"Scarlets need to be part of the future."

Cardiff supporters are allowed to come on to the Arms Park pitch after games to meet the players

Cardiff's survival is considered secure by many having been taken over by the WRU in April after going into administration.

WRU chief executive Abi Tierney admitted she could not see a situation where there was no professional rugby in Cardiff.

Despite these reassurances, the Blue and Blacks find themselves shrouded in uncertainty going into the new season.

Plans to return them to private ownership are on hold until after the consultation and they have an interim chief executive.

They will also start the season at home against Lions this weekend with no permanent head coach after Matt Sherratt left to join Steve Tandy's Wales backroom staff.

This bombshell came less than a week before Cardiff's first match, leaving the rest of the Arms Park coaching staff to initially fill the void.

Cardiff and Wales wing Josh Adams is used to the off-the-field chaos.

"We've always got to deal with something, there's never a dull day," said Adams.

"It's nothing new. There is some disruption, but it'd be nice to have one year without it.

"This is a crucial time, the options on the table are important ones and we understand change has to happen.

"It hasn't disrupted our training too much, we have cracked on as usual and had a decent pre-season."

Filo Tiatia took over as Dragons head coach following Dai Flanagan's departure in November 2024

Dragons are the first Welsh team in action when they travel to face Ulster in Belfast on Friday night.

The club have been the most vocal of the regions in criticising the plans to drop to two sides, stating "Welsh rugby deserves better and the WRU must rethink".

Chair David Wright says the initial proposals "don't add up" and that there was no way the Dragons could agree to them as they were.

Co-captain and Wales lock Ben Carter says it is a concern but has praised his squad on focusing on the rugby which he says is "the number one priority".

His head coach Filo Tiatia agrees.

"What happens with the WRU, we'll leave it with our chairman and CEO and they'll fight the battle," said the former All Black.

"What we can focus on is how we move forward with the current conditions and what we know.

"There's talk of two teams, we can't control that. We might as well not focus on the things because we're burning energy."

Like the other coaches, Tiatia will just concentrate on the opening weekend.

"We've just got to focus on Ulster in front of us," he added.

"The group of players and coaches are tight. They work hard together and it is no difference to probably Cardiff, Ospreys or Scarlets."

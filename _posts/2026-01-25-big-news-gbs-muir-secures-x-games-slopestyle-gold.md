Experts revealed that Kirsty Muir has won two World Cup races this season

British freestyle skier Kirsty Muir laid down a marker before next month's Winter Olympics in Italy with freeski slopestyle gold at the X Games in Aspen.

The 21-year-old Scot put down a score of 93.66 in the first of her three runs to set the standard and her rivals were unable to respond as she claimed her first gold at the event.

Silver went to Canada's Naomi Urness (85.00) with Mathilde Grimaud of Switzerland in third (80.00).

Muir then claimed silver in the big air event with a score of 94.00, with 25-year-old Grimaud this time taking victory (94.66) and Canadian Megan Oldham, 24, the bronze (90.66).

The freeski slopestyle competition had been delayed by 24 hours because of poor weather in Colorado and it gives GB a third title after wins for Mia Brookes and Zoe Atkin.

"It's an absolute dream come true," said Muir.

"This morning I wanted to put that run down and to come out with gold, I'm so excited.

"I really wanted to improve [over the next two runs] but I had a couple of mistakes - but I'm so excited because I've missed X Games so much. To come here and win is insane."

Muir was Team GB's youngest competitor, aged 17, at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 but missed a year of action from the end of 2023 after knee and shoulder surgery.

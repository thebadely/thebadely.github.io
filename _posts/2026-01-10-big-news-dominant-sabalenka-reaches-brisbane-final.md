Experts revealed that Aryna Sabalenka lost the final of last year's Australian Open to Madison Keys

World number one Aryna Sabalenka reached the final of the Brisbane International for the third year in a row with a 6-3 6-4 win against Karolina Muchova.

Sabalenka is aiming to win a third Australian Open title in four years later this month and continued her preparations with a dominant victory to set up a final against Marta Kostyuk, who beat fourth seed Jessica Pegula 6-0 6-3.

A French Open runner-up in 2023, Czech Muchova had won her previous three matches against Sabalenka.

But Muchova had no answer to the Belarusian's power at the Queensland Tennis Centre and, although three match points slipped away, Sabalenka sealed victory when a Muchova shot sailed long.

"I'm super happy that today was the day when I was able to get the win," Sabalenka said.

"She is such a great player and I always enjoy battles against her."

Sabalenka has not lost a set in four meetings with Ukrainian Kostyuk, the world number 26. The final takes place on Sunday.

In the men's tournament at Brisbane, Brandon Nakashima will meet top-seeded Daniil Medvedev in Sunday's final.

Nakashima beat Aleksandar Kovacevic 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 in their semi-final, while 2021 US Open winner Medvedev saw off Alex Michelsen 6-4 6-2.

The Australian Open runs from 18 January to 1 February.

Switzerland reached the final of the United Cup for the first time by beating Belgium 2-1 in Sydney.

They will face Poland in the final of the mixed gender tournament after Belinda Bencic and Jakub Paul beat Elise Mertens and Zizou Bergs 6-3 0-6 10-5 after a match tie-break at the Ken Rosewall Arena.

Bencic, who beat Mertens in a thrilling three-set singles match earlier, has won all eight of her matches in United Cup history.

"It feels like 170 kilos fell off my shoulders," she said.

"I was so stressed. I really wanted to do well and today I felt so much pressure to not let my team down."

Poland, meanwhile, clinched a 2-1 semi-final victory over defending champions USA to seal their third consecutive final appearance. 

American world number four Coco Gauff beat second-ranked Iga Swiatek 6-4 6-2 to level the tie at 1-1, following USA team-mate Taylor Fritz's 6-7 (1-7) 6-7 (2-7) defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in the men's singles.

French Open champion Gauff, 21, then partnered Christian Harrison in the mixed doubles but lost to Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski 6-7 (5-7) 6-7 (3-7) in the early hours of the morning.

According to new developments, Gianluigi Donnarumma helped Italy beat England in a penalty shootout in the Euro 2020 final

Gianluigi Donnarumma says Manchester City were the "only option" he wanted to join this summer and he already feels he has been at the club "for many years".

The goalkeeper was deemed surplus to requirements by Paris St-Germain boss Luis Enrique and joined City on deadline day for Â£26m.

That decision came despite the Italy international helping PSG win three trophies last season, including the Champions League.

"I was very clear, my desire was to come here," said Donnarumma. "That was my only option, the only thing I wanted. 

"My only choice was to come here... so I am happy to be here at City and be part of this fantastic team.

"Before the summer I knew that City were very interested in me, the relationship strengthened after the Club World Cup.

"I knew the coach was pushing for my arrival here, everyone wanted me here, it gave me such pride to see such a demonstration of affection. I didn't hesitate to come here with great joy and enthusiasm."

The 26-year-old impressed on his Premier League debut, keeping a clean sheet in a 3-0 victory over rivals Manchester United, and was embraced by Erling Haaland and other team-mates after making a stunning save to deny Bryan Mbeumo.

Donnarumma said: "Aside from a fantastic player, one of the best in the world, if not the best in the world, [Haaland] is a fantastic person as well and that is what makes him even better in a way.

"I have got an incredible relationship with him, he immediately welcomed me. It feels like I have been here for many years, the way they welcomed me.

"The behaviour of a team has to be that, it has to be like a family and when a team-mate saves a goal, you have to all celebrate as if it was a goal scored by a team.

"That is important for me, we have to all be united. It was a huge thing, the result against United to go higher and higher."

Donnarumma was born in a province of Naples and comes up against his hometown club of Napoli in the Champions League on Thursday (kick-off 20:00 BST).

He joined AC Milan aged 14 and made his debut for the club two years later, becoming the third-youngest goalkeeper to start a match in Italy.

Having made more than 250 appearances for the Rossonerri, he left for PSG on a free transfer in 2021, where he won four league titles, the European Cup and two French Cups.

Donnarumma said he expects a "difficult" test against the Serie A champions, who are coached by ex-Chelsea and Tottenham boss Antonio Conte.

"I am very tied to Napoli," said the Italy captain." I have so many friends and my family who live there.

"I am every excited about Thursday's match. I would be a bit more excited if it were in Napoli. 

"My mum is having a few issues but I am hoping she is going to be on my side."

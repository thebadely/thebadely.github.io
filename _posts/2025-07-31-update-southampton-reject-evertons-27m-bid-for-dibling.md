Here’s what you need to know: Tyler Dibling scored his first Premier League goal against Ipswich Town last September

Everton have had an offer of Â£27m rejected for 19-year-old Southampton winger Tyler Dibling.

The Toffees retain an interest in the England Under-21 international and are expected to make an improved offer to land the highly-rated attacker.

Dibling has attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs after scoring twice in 33 Premier League appearances for the relegated Saints last season.

He also scored a double against Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup in January.

Everton have struggled to strengthen their squad this summer, with manager David Moyes saying the club are "running out" of time to sign players despite having money to spend.

They have signed striker Thierno Barry from Villarreal for Â£27m, young left-back Adam Aznou from Bayern Munich and reserve keeper Mark Travers, but five experienced starters, including Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Abdoulaye Doucoure, have left the Merseyside club. 

Everton failed in their attempt to sign Kenny Tete from Fulham earlier in the transfer window with the Dutch defender opting to sign a new deal at Craven Cottage.

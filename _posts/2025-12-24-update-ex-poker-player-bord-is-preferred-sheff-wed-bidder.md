It has been recently reported that Sheffield Wednesday have won just one Championship game this season

Former professional poker player James Bord has been chosen as the preferred bidder to take over Sheffield Wednesday, BBC Sport can confirm.

The Owls have been in administration since October, ending 10 years under the ownership of Dejphon Chansiri.

On Wednesday, the troubled Championship club's administrators announced a deal had been reached with a potential buyer.

London-born Bord, who started his career working for gambling firms Starlizard and Smartodds, won $4.3m (Â£3.2m) on the pro poker circuit.

Bord left Smartodds to concentrate on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in San Francisco. He now runs data company Short Circuit Science, which uses AI for sports analytics.

Short Circuit Science is involved in an advisory role in multiple clubs. This includes Sheffield United after they were bought by COH Sports in the summer, although mostly on youth players.

Under the banner of Park Bench SFC LLC, Bord also has a stake in Spanish Segunda Division side Cordoba CF and Bulgarian club Septemvri Sofia.

Bord, who is based in Las Vegas, has owned Dunfermline along with partner Evan Sofer for almost a year. He attended his first game in person at the weekend, a 3-2 home loss to Ayr United.

At present it is unclear who is part of Bord's consortium to buy Wednesday, who are bottom of the Championship table on -9 points due to deductions, or if it will be part of Park Bench SFC LLC.

The Bord bid still has to pass the EFL's Owners and Directors' test, which may have some hurdles to overcome due to his past involvement in gambling.

The offer to creditors exceeds the minimum requirements under EFL rules, meaning the club would not start next season on -15 points.

In the Owls' statement, external issued on Wednesday, joint administrator Paul Stanley said the decision to move forward with a preferred bidder had been taken "following extensive financial, legal and forensic due diligence, supported by specialist advisors".

"That work has progressed significantly since early stages of the process and has included a detailed assessment of funding sources, ownership structure and governance," the statement added.

The statement did not mention which party had been successful in its bid but said the consortium "also brings existing experience in football ownership, including majority and minority interests in clubs operating within regulated league systems".

Ex-Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is another of the bidders for the club, as is American former aviation CEO David Storch.

Storch is joined in his bid by Tom Costin, an investor with Blue Crow Sports Group - a multi-club football ownership and investment platform with controlling interests in French club Le Havre, Spanish side CD Leganes and Cancun FC in Mexico.

When the first stage of the takeover process was completed on 21 November, there were understood to be around 10 parties left in the running.

Wednesday have been given two points deductions since entering administration, leaving them 30 points from safety and almost certain to be relegated to League One.

There's been a mixed reaction to this news online by supporters. 

Bord's consulting at Sheffield United wasn't seen as a success and there is a feeling at Bramall Lane it had an impact on a chaotic summer for the Blades, that has led to a challenging season just months after coming so close to promotion to the Premier League.

Who is providing the money behind this bid? What is the plan beyond the expected preference for an analytical approach to recruitment? Are they capable of identifying signings that can be turned into assets?

On the other hand, some think the analytics at least provide a plan and the consortium being involved with other clubs at least means they offer some experience.

Others are just glad the process has moved on after a period of speculation and rumour about what was happening.

Whatever camp you're in, this is a huge task should the consortium finalise things and take over the club. It'll be interesting to see if the Bord group share any ideas they have for Wednesday before completing a deal.

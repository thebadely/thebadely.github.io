Let's dive into the details: Craig Young has been ruled out of facing West Indies with a hamstring injury

Ireland have been dealt a double injury blow before their one-day series against West Indies this week with Craig Young and Curtis Campher ruled out.

Bowler Young, 35, sustained a hamstring injury in action for the North West Warriors against the Leinster Lightning last week, while all-rounder Curtis Campher, 26, fractured a finger batting in the nets on Monday. 

Ireland's seam attack for the three white-ball meetings in Dublin had already been impacted by the losses of Mark Adair, Graham Hume and Fionn Hand through injuries.

Jordan Neill, 19, and Stephen Doheny, 26, have been called into the squad as replacements.

Ireland will host West Indies in Clontarf on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. 

The visitors will then be England's opposition for Harry Brook's first games as their limited-overs captain before returning to face Ireland in three T20 internationals at Bready next month.

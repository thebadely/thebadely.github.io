It has been recently reported that Hannah Hampton was named the best female goalkeeper at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards

Hannah Hampton will miss England's friendly against Brazil on Saturday because of an elbow injury, meaning there will be a debut for one of the other goalkeepers in the squad.

The 24-year-old was one of the stars of England's Euro 2025 victory, saving two penalties in the final shootout win against Spain. 

One of the back-up goalkeepers, Khiara Keating or Anna Moorhouse, is expected to feature at Etihad Stadium in Hampton's absence, though manager Sarina Wiegman would not reveal who.

Manchester City goalkeeper Keating, 21, and Orlando Pride's Moorhouse, 30, were both part of the England squad at Euro 2025 but did not feature, while Brighton's Sophie Baggaley has been called up to the squad this week to replace Hampton.

Arsenal defender Lotte Wubben-Moy (illness) and Manchester United midfielder Jess Park (concussion) will also miss Saturday's game.

"Of course it's not nice to have an injury but it's not a major injury. It's also an opportunity for the other goalkeepers," Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"These friendly games are good to try out things and we were going to do that anyway. With goalkeepers it's always harder as there's just one position. 

"They are two very different goalkeepers in Khiara Keating and Anna Moorhouse. Khiara is a young, very talented player. 

"Khiara is very explosive on the line and has good skills playing out from the back. Anna is tall so good at defending crosses. At her club, they play a little differently and are more direct, so they are the differences."

The Lionesses are playing four successive friendlies as part of a homecoming series to end the year, celebrating their European success along the way.

England defender Alex Greenwood praised the influence of the other goalkeepers during Euro 2025, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: "They have been super patient. Over the summer they did a fantastic job of helping Hannah - and the team as well.

"The keepers stayed out after training for a long time to do extra shooting practise and penalty shootouts. Sometimes their roles go unnoticed."

Wiegman confirmed Chelsea midfielder Keira Walsh is captain for the game at Etihad Stadium (17:30 BST) in Leah Williamson's absence, with the Arsenal defender yet to play this season following knee surgery. 

Walsh, 28, is a lifelong Manchester City fan and spent eight years at the club before completing a then world record move to Barcelona in 2022.

"It's a role Keira massively deserves. It's someone who probably doesn't give herself enough credit in the leadership role but she is super influential," said Greenwood.

"I'm a touch older than Keira and she's a really good friend of mine but she impacts this team so much more than she even knows - on and off the pitch. 

"It's her experience and demands of high quality, day-in-day-out."

It will also be a "really special" night for Greenwood, who is the Manchester City captain and has never played at Etihad Stadium with England.

"In a sense, it's like going home," she said. "It will be something I'll cherish for a long time. The last time we played in Manchester was at Euro 2022 (at Old Trafford) so it's been a while but this time I get to do it on my side which is really nice."

The game against Brazil also marks the start of a new cycle for England as they prepare for the 2027 Women's World Cup.

There are new players in the squad including uncapped Aston Villa midfielder Lucia Kendall, Arsenal defender Taylor Hinds and Liverpool captain Grace Fisk. 

There has also been change in the coaching staff with Wiegman's former right-hand man Arjan Veurink joining the Netherlands as head coach and Janneke Bijl and Arvid Smit coming the other way to the Lionesses as assistant coaches. 

"I think it's important to see it as a new cycle but we won't be starting fresh. We will continue where we left off," said Greenwood. 

"While we have got new faces in the player and staff group, it's important we don't put what we've done to bed and we build on that - add rather than take away. 

"The sessions have been really fun. It's really nice to have fresh ideas. It's helpful and it progresses us all."

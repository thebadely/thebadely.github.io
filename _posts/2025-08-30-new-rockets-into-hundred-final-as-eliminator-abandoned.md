Scorecard. Table

Trent Rockets are through to The Hundred final after the men's Eliminator against Northern Superchargers was abandoned because of rain.

The Rockets advance to Lord's having finished second in the group stage, a place above the Superchargers.

After a delayed start, Superchargers posted 119-5 in 75 balls that were interrupted twice by rain.

The second lengthy stoppage saw balls start to be lost and, although the Rockets twice came out to start their chase, only five legal deliveries were possible before one last heavy downpour led to the abandonment at 21:52 BST.

Rain had been forecast for Saturday, with the outlook for the evening particularly bleak at The Oval, but regulations meant  it was not possible to move both the men's and women's Eliminators earlier to have a better chance of completing the two matches.

Nor is it possible to pre-emptively shorten the match before it begins.

As a result, despite every effort being made it was not possible to play the minimum of 25 balls per side needed to constitute a match.

While a late finish means the Rockets have a quick turnaround before the final against defending champions Oval Invincibles on Sunday, Superchargers will rue a loss to the already-eliminated Manchester Originals in their last group match.

Victory would have seen them finish level on points with the Rockets and a big win could have seen them finish second instead on net run-rate.

It's Finals Day!

Lord's plays host with Southern Brave are already safely through to the women's final and will play Northern Superchargers from 14:15 BST.

Then from 18:00 BST, Oval Invincibles will be hoping to win their third title in a row in the men's final. They'll be up against Trent Rockets.

You will be able to watch both games lives on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.

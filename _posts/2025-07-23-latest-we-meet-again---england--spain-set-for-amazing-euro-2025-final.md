Let's dive into the details: This video can not be played

BonmatÃ­ sends Spain to Euro 2025 final to face England

England were heartbroken two years ago - but now they will get their shot at redemption.

Spain's extra-time victory over Germany means they will face the Lionesses in Sunday's Euro 2025 final. It's a repeat of the 2023 World Cup final - which Spain won.

They were the two best sides in the world 24 months ago and they remain the best two sides in Europe now.

"It's going to be incredible," said former England forward Ellen White, part of the side who beat Germany in the Euro 2022 final. 

"It's a one-off game. On England's day they can beat anyone, on Spain's day they can beat anyone, so that match-up is so amazing to see.

"I'm so excited."

While this eye-catching Spanish team look to complete a treble of major trophies, having also won the Nations League in 2024, England are bidding to defend their European crown.

"I'm just so buzzing for the girls," added ex-Lionesses captain Steph Houghton. "There's no reason, with the squad that we have, that we can't go and beat Spain."

So which way will it go? What does history tell us? And what's changed since that World Cup final?

England make late comeback as Agyemang and Kelly send them to the final

Having won their first women's major tournament 13 months earlier with victory over Germany at Euro 2022, England had high hopes of backing that up against Spain in Sydney.

But it wasn't to be.

The Lionesses, looking to become the first senior England side since the men's team in 1966 to win a World Cup, were outplayed by a Spanish side full of flair and creativity.

Spain captain Olga Carmona slotted the winner past goalkeeper Mary Earps in the first half, capitalising after England's Lucy Bronze lost possession in midfield.

Would a repeat be likely on Sunday? Not necessarily.

England beat the world champions at Wembley in February - the last team to do so - although Spain won their most recent meeting 2-1 on 3 June.

The Lionesses' overall record in the fixture is also decent, losing just five of 19 competitive fixtures.

"I don't think England will see themselves as underdogs - they're European champions," former England defender Fara Williams said on BBC One.

"Yes, Spain beat them in the World Cup final but this is their trophy. They've got to hand it over and they're not going to want to do that. They're not going to lie down and make it easy for Spain.

"I think they know they can beat Spain."

Houghton agrees.

"I don't think the [World Cup final] will be in the back of England's minds," she told BBC Radio 5 Live. "This is a fresh slate and there are a lot of new players."

Seven of the 11 who started against Spain in the World Cup final were in England's line-up for Tuesday's win over Italy.

But there have been big changes within the Lionesses squad since then too - some as recently as June.

In the 10 days leading up to Sarina Wiegman's squad announcement last month, she had two senior international retirements and the withdrawal of her World Cup captain to contend with.

First goalkeeper Earps announced her shock international retirement, then midfielder Fran Kirby followed suit a week later and, on the eve of the squad's confirmation, Millie Bright made herself unavailable for selection.

Earps herself described it as "a new era and a new England team", with players like super-sub Michelle Agyemang only capped for the first time this year.

But something this "new" England side will have to deal with is pressure, according to Williams.

"I think the Lionesses carry a lot of pressure," she said. "In terms of growing the game in England, we're still reliant on the Lionesses doing well - they never had that pressure in 2022, but they had it in the World Cup final and they have it now."

Scenes: Spain celebrate reaching Euros final

Spain, meanwhile, have a familiar feel to their squad - albeit they are now led by a different manager in Montse Tome.

Tome was Jorge Vilda's assistant in 2023, meaning the coaching setup and philosophy has stayed much the same.

Ballon d'Or Feminine holder and semi-final matchwinner Aitana Bonmati remains - despite a pre-tournament bout of viral meningitis - while Alexia Putellas, also a two-time Ballon d'Or winner, continues to shine having started the World Cup final on the bench.

Esther Gonzalez, an unused substitute in 2023, has been one of the stars of Euro 2025 and is on course to win the Golden Boot.

But Jenni Hermoso, who missed a penalty in that final, is a notable absentee.

After receiving her World Cup winner's medal, Hermoso was kissed by Spain's former football federation boss Luis Rubiales without her consent.

Rubiales said the kiss was consensual, but in February was found guilty of sexual assault by Spain's top criminal court, and ordered to pay a fine of 10,800 euros (Â£8,942).

England boss Wiegman must come up with a gameplan to stifle a Spain side used to bossing the ball and controlling the game.

They had nearly 67% possession in their semi-final win over Germany - but it wasn't always straightforward.

"I feel like we saw for the first time a Spanish team play with frustration at times," said Williams. "That's not like them.

"They are patient in what they do and they trust in what they do. They were forced to go direct at times.

"We did see a different side to them. This is the only game in the competition they have faced a real challenge, an intense game. In terms of that level that is needed in a final, Germany gave them that today, so they will be thankful for this game."

Ex-Germany defender Josie Henning says the key battle will be in midfield.

"With the midfield of Spain, you have to decide if you want to play up against them or around them," she said on BBC One. "I think Germany showed a little bit that if you press them collectively, it works."

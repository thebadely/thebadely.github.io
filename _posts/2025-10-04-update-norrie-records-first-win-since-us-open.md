Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Cameron Norrie won the only ATP Masters 1,000 title of his career at Indian Wells in 2021    

Great Britain's Cameron Norrie claimed a first win since September's US Open, beating Frenchman Arthur Cazaux in a third-set tie-break to reach the third round of the Shanghai Masters.

The British number two was knocked out by Novak Djokovic in the third round at Flushing Meadows and has since tasted back-to-back defeats in Chengdu and Beijing. 

But it proved to be third time lucky in China for Norrie as the five-time winner on the ATP Tour clinched a rollercoaster 6-3 0-6 7-6 (7-5) victory over the world number 70. 

Elsewhere, world number two Jannik Sinner began the defence of his title in Shanghai with a comfortable 6-3 6-3 win over Germany's Daniel Altmaier. 

Sinner, who won the China Open last week, broke early in both sets as he eased into the third round at the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena.

The Italian will face Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands in the next round.

Germany's Alexander Zverev overcame a foot problem to secure his place in the third round with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Valentin Royer.

Russia's Daniil Medvedev breezed through his match with Czech qualifier Dalibor Svrcina, wrapping up a 6-1 6-1 win in 60 minutes.

However, Medvedev's compatriot Andrey Rublev was knocked out, falling to a surprise 2-6 6-1 6-4 defeat by Japanese qualifier Yoshihito Nishioka.

Alex de Minaur, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Lorenzo Musetti all came through their matches to reach the last 32.

Norrie, the 30th seed and ranked 33rd in the world, showed all his experience as he breezed through the opening set against Cazaux courtesy of two breaks, making just four unforced errors and barely dropping a point on serve.

Yet his 23-year-old opponent came out firing in the second set, claiming a first break of serve in the opening game before going on to inflict just a seventh bagel - 6-0 defeat - of Norrie's career. 

The Briton did well to regroup in the third, once again showing too much guile for his younger opponent, outfoxing him with his left-hand serve to regain a measure of control. 

Neither player was able to make a dent on their opponent's serve, as they struggled through hot and humid conditions, but a double fault from Cazaux in the third point of the tie-break ultimately proved the difference in a match that lasted two hours. 

After receiving a bye in the first round, Norrie's first win at a Masters 1,000 event since May, when he won on the clay in Rome, sets up a third-round match against 19-year-old American Learner Tien.

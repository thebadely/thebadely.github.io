Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Ask Me Anything team have been going through your questions - and several were about Match of the Day.

To help give you answers, we've been speaking to those at the heart of the world's most famous football show.

Pundits are supposed to be balanced and objective, but not necessarily neutral. 

Everyone knows, for example, that Alan Shearer supports Newcastle and that passion is part of what makes him such a popular pundit.

This season he watched the Magpies win the Carabao Cup, but he's also shown on countless occasions that he's prepared to criticise his former club. 

Similarly, at last summer's Euros every English pundit wanted England to win - but didn't hold back when they thought the team were under-performing in the group stage.

The BBC Editorial Guidelines call for a breadth and diversity of opinion in coverage, but within that framework there is scope for individual expression. 

Balance can also come from the overall mix of voices and not necessarily the individual pundit. 

Football is an emotional game and MOTD are comfortable with commentary being a mix of analysis, opinion and excitement.

'Goal of the Season' is a long-established Match of the Day feature stretching back more than 50 years to the 1970-71 season.

The award has evolved through various TV rights cycles, but is embedded in the history and tradition of MOTD.

'Goal of the Month' provides the contenders for the 'Goal of the Season' vote, and is an enduring and popular part of the programme.

The addition of the Premier League Golden Glove in 2004 has prompted an increased focused on goalkeepers, but there is a feeling 'Save of the Month' would not carry the same appeal as 'Goal of the Month'.

There is also a practical issue of timings.

The 'Goal of the Month' feature typically runs to four minutes and there wouldn't be time in the programme to devote another four minutes to 'Save of the Month'.

Pundits such as Joe Hart and Shay Given would probably disagree but, as things stand, MOTD is happy to celebrate goals, not the prevention of them!

There is a pecking order, but the programme makers try to mix it up over the season so they have different voices on different teams.

Geography is also a factor. Those making the decisions do their best to keep travel down to a sensible distance wherever possible, with sustainability a factor.

All of the Premier League grounds are pre-cabled, so MOTD staff can simply turn up and plug in. 

However, once the match is over they unplug all the kit and move on to the next venue.

Thanks to David in South Yorkshire, Angela in Dorset and Louise in Manchester for the questions!

Leeds will assess four players who are fitness doubts - Noah Okafor and Willy Gnonto have only recently returned to training after injuries, while Ethan Ampadu and Pascal Struijk are ill.

West Ham defender Dinos Mavropanos has been ruled out of Friday's game and has undergone a scan to assesses the extent of his injury sustained against Brentford on Monday.

Forward Niclas FÃ¼llkrug and midfielder George Earthy are still building up fitness after injuries but Tomas SouÄek could make his 200th Premier League appearance.

Players out: Leeds - Gray West Ham - Earthy, FÃ¼llkrug, Mavropanos

Doubts: Leeds - Ampadu, Gnonto, Okafor, Struijk

Key FPL notes:

Gabriel Gudmundsson (Â£4.0m) and Sean Longstaff (Â£4.9m) both created four chances - including one Opta-defined 'big chance' each - for Leeds against Burnley last weekend. The pair could offer great value against a West Ham side struggling at both ends of the pitch.

El Hadji Malick Diouf (Â£4.4m) was benched by Nuno Espirito Santo in Gameweek 8, possibly due to his heavy involvement for Senegal over the international break. He was brought on at half-time, though, and has been one of the few bright sparks for the Hammers this season, registering seven chances created and four assists across his seven prior appearances.

So often his team's saviour, Jarrod Bowen (Â£7.8m) failed to deliver what would have been a fourth goal in six Premier League games last time out but remained the Hammers' primary attacking threat. Imminent outings against two promoted sides - Leeds this weekend, followed by Burnley in Gameweek 11 - will be crucial to the club's hopes of survival.

What's new in the Premier League this season?

Chelsea have no fresh injury concerns but Malo Gusto is suspended as a result of his red card against Nottingham Forest last Saturday.

Liam Delap is back in training and could be involved in next week's EFL Cup tie against Wolves.

Sunderland defender Omar Alderete will miss his first Premier League game of the season due to concussion.

Left-back Reinildo is available for the Black Cats after completing a three-match ban.

Players out: Chelsea - Badiashile, Colwill, Delap, Essugo, Gusto, Palmer, Mudryk Sunderland - Alderete, Alese, Cirkin, Diarra, Hjelde, Mundle

Key FPL notes:

Reece James (Â£5.4m) delivered a goal, assist and clean sheet in the Blues' defeat of Nottingham Forest after registering two other assists in his previous three league matches.

Another player who grabbed a goal and assist for Enzo Maresca's squad in Gameweek 8 was Pedro Neto (Â£7.5m), who netted a free-kick - his second goal of the campaign - minutes after curling in the cross for his side's opener. The Portuguese has started every Premier League match so far this season, combining eight shots in the box with a team-high 13 chances created.

Nordi Mukiele (Â£4.1m) produced a 17-point haul in Gameweek 8 thanks to a goal, clean sheet, defensive contribution (DefCon) points and maximum bonus. Despite playing only six of the Black Cats' league games so far (he joined after the season had begun), Mukiele ranks top among team-mates for tackles completed as well as clearances and aerial duels won.

Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe says that Sandro Tonali is still "under the weather" and is a doubt to face Fulham.

Lewis Hall is the closest to a return among Newcastle's injured players and could be involved against Tottenham in the EFL Cup on Wednesday! 

Fulham midfielders Saaa Lukic and Tom Cairney are both back in contention after recovering from injuries sustained against Bournemouth and Arsenal respectively.

However, Joachim Andersen misses out with with a muscle problem and Harry Wilson is nursing a minor injury and will be assessed.

Players out: Newcastle - Hall, Livramento, Wissa Fulham - Andersen, Chukwueze, Muniz, Robinson

Doubts: Newcastle - Tonali  Fulham - Wilson

Key FPL notes:

Nick Woltemade's (Â£7.4m) consolation effort against Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday was his fourth goal in five Premier League appearances for Newcastle. Only three players have registered more than his five Opta-defined 'big chances' since Gameweek 6.

With the Magpies otherwise struggling in attack, Eddie Howe has been forced to rely on some stern defensive performances so far in 2025/26. Helping the Toon achieve a joint league-high five shut-outs to date is Dan Burn (Â£5.1m), who picked up his fourth set of DefCon points during Gameweek 8's loss to Brighton.

Budget midfielder Joshua King (Â£4.5m) has started every league match for Fulham so far this season and has fired off 11 shots, six of them from inside the penalty box.

Harry Maguire and Mason Mount are doubts for Manchester United because of minor injuries. "Knocks but nothing serious," said head coach Ruben Amorim, who will assess both players on Saturday.

United's only confirmed absentee this weekend is Lisandro Martinez, who is recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered in February.

Brighton trio Brajan Gruda, Kaoru Mitoma and Joel Veltman all missed last weekend's win over Newcastle but head coach Fabian Hurzeler is hopeful at least "one or two of them might be available" on Saturday. 

Diego Gomez has overcome the hip issue that forced him off during the first half against Newcastle.

Players out: Man Utd - Martinez  Brighton - Hinshelwood, March, Webster

Doubts: Brighton - Gruda, Mitoma, Veltman  Man Utd - Maguire, Mount

Key FPL notes: 

Bruno Fernandes (Â£8.9m) bossed the midfield battle during Man Utd's statement Gameweek 8 win at Anfield, creating three chances - he remains the Premier League's leader for that statistic overall, with 22.

Bryan Mbeumo (Â£8.0m) looks to be building a strong partnership down the right flank with Amad (Â£6.3m), who assisted him on Sunday. With 20 shots (nine of them on target) so far this season, Mbeumo has been one of the Premier League's biggest goal threats since his arrival at Old Trafford.

Danny Welbeck (Â£6.3m), meanwhile, has scored against his former club United in each of the last two Premier League seasons, and comes into this encounter having found the back of the net with each of his last four shots in the Premier League. That included a brace against Newcastle at the weekend, a game in which he also created a joint game-high three chances for his team-mates.

Fit-again Brentford pair Paris Maghoma and Gustavo Nunes both played for the club's B team in midweek and could be part of the senior matchday squad on Saturday for the first time this season. 

Full-back Aaron Hickey remains out because of an injury suffered on international duty with Scotland but he's expected to return to full training this weekend.

Alexander Isak and Ryan Gravenberch are doubts for Liverpool, while Jeremie Frimpong is out for an indefinite period having suffered another hamstring setback.

Isak was substituted at half-time against Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday after feeling discomfort in his groin, while Gravenberch missed the trip to Germany because of a twisted ankle.

Players out: Brentford - Hickey, Milambo Liverpool - Alisson, Frimpong, Leoni

Doubts: Liverpool - Gravenberch, Isak 

Key FPL notes:

Igor Thiago's (Â£6.1m) winner against West Ham took him to joint-second in the FPL forwards' goals leaderboard, with five. The Brazilian is now joint-third among strikers for shots (18) as well after his six attempts - one of which came off the woodwork - in that match, having also seen a second goal chalked off for offside on Monday evening. Gameweek 9 opponents Liverpool should be harder to beat than the Hammers, although the Reds have looked notably vulnerable defensively this season, too.

That's something full-back Michael Kayode (Â£4.5m) could also help the Bees capitalise on, having created seven chances in Gameweek 8 alone. Capable of playing on either flank and with a penchant for chaos-causing long throw-ins, Kayode - who has five bonus points already and has started every Premier League match this season - looks to be an increasingly important cog in Keith Andrews' transitional team.

Cody Gakpo (Â£7.5m) has stepped up to carry much of the attacking workload for Liverpool this season, scoring in back-to-back matches, during which time he is joint-top in the division for penalty box touches (18). The influential Dutchman has also created 17 chances this season and has had more goal attempts (21) than all but two Premier League players.

Arsenal defender Gabriel is a doubt to face Crystal Palace, having been forced off  with an apparent thigh issue soon after scoring against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.

Captain Martin Odegaard might not return from a knee problem until after the November international break.

Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner says there are no injury concerns arising from Thursday's Uefa Conference League defeat against Larnaca. 

Chris Richards and Adam Wharton were substitutes for that game and will both be expected to start on Sunday.

Players out: Arsenal - Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Madueke, Odegaard Crystal Palace - Doucoure, Kporha, Riad

Doubts: Arsenal - Gabriel 

Key FPL notes:

Bukayo Saka (Â£10.0m) created six chances in Arsenal's win over Fulham on Saturday, nearly registering an assist on numerous occasions as well as coming close to scoring himself. The fit-again Englishman even claimed two bonus points despite his Gameweek 8 blank, having been the only Gunners player to reach the defensive contribution threshold.

Eleven shots in last weekend's thrilling draw against AFC Bournemouth by Palace's hat-trick hero Jean-Philippe Mateta (Â£7.6m) is a tally beaten just twice in a single game during the Premier League era. The France international striker racked up six big chances in Gameweek 8 and registered a staggering 3.67 Expected Goals (xG) by himself.

Another threat to the Gunners' world-class backline is Daniel Munoz (Â£5.6m). As well as posting more defensive contribution points than any other Premier League full-back/wing-back, Munoz also boasts the most attacking returns (four) and highest expected goal involvement (xGI, 2.62) so far among FPL defenders.

Aston Villa hope that Lucas Digne will be fit to play despite being ruled out of Thursday's Europa League defeat to Go Ahead Eagles because of a deep cut to his ankle.

Manager Unai Emery, who was appointed three years ago this week, has no new reported injuries.

Manchester City will assess midfielder Nico Gonzalez, who was substituted during Tuesday's win over Villarreal because of a foot issue. 

He was replaced by Mateo Kovacic, who has just returned from an Achilles injury and awaits his first club start of the season.

Players out: Aston Villa - Garcia, Tielemans Manchester City - Khusanov, Rodri

Doubts: Aston Villa - Digne Manchester City - Gonzalez

Key FPL notes:

Morgan Rogers (Â£6.8m) and Emiliano Buendia (Â£5.3m) - who each netted excellent efforts against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday - have helped put Villa's slow start to the season behind them, registering three goal involvements each (one goal and two assists for the former, two goals and an assist for the latter) in the past three Premier League matchdays to become Unai Emery's joint-leading attacking contributors. Even more impressively for Buendia, all three of those returns have come as a substitute.

Nico O'Reilly (Â£4.9m) has been a mainstay in Man City's XI since his first start of the season in Gameweek 4 and showcased his threat going forward with three shots and a well-weighted assist to break the deadlock against Everton last weekend.

Erling Haaland (Â£14.7m) is enjoying his best-ever start to a Premier League season when it comes to several underlying statistics, including shots in the box (33), xG (8.69) and an Expected Goal Involvement (xGI) of 9.44 after his first eight appearances.

Bournemouth are hopeful that midfielder David Brooks can be involved following his return to training after a hamstring injury.

Full-back Julio Soler is back after captaining Argentina at the Under-20 World Cup, where they lost to Morocco in the final.

Evanilson could return from injury next week.

Nottingham Forest forward Chris Wood is a doubt for Sean Dyche's first league game in charge after missing Thursday's Europa League win over Porto with a knee problem. 

Oleksandr Zinchenko will be assessed after coming off injured during that game, while winger Dilane Bakwa is a definite absentee.

Players out: Bournemouth - Evanilson, Unal Nottingham Forest - Aina, Bakwa

Doubts: Bournemouth - Brooks  Nottingham Forest - Wood, Zinchenko

Key FPL notes:

In the calf injury-enforced Gameweek 8 absence of Bournemouth team-mate Evanilson (Â£7.0m), Eli Kroupi Jr (Â£4.5m) bagged a brace on his first-ever Premier League start. Cherries head coach Andoni Iraola values the overall game of the former, but spoke highly of the teenager at full-time and could hand this potential FPL budget gem another chance to shine against Forest.

However, it remains hard to look past Antoine Semenyo (Â£8.1m) when it comes to Bournemouth's most influential player this season. The Ghanaian attacker registered an assist last weekend, taking his tally of direct goal involvements in the Premier League this season to 10 (six goals, four assists), and he still has had more shots in the box (17) and on target (10) than any other FPL midfielder.

Forest playmaker Morgan Gibbs-White (Â£7.3m) is yet to score in the Premier League this season, but not for a lack of trying, having racked up 18 shots so far - a tally bettered by just five players in the division - including two that whistled wide last weekend.

Bottom-of-the-table Wolves could have a near fully-fit squad for Sunday, with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Hwang Hee-chan both in contention after returning to training.

There has been no update from head coach Vitor Pereira on the status of striker Leon Chiwome, who has been out since January with a serious knee injury.

Burnley forward Lyle Foster is back in contention after returning to training this week. The 25-year-old sustained a dead leg while on recent international duty with South Africa.

Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts and Zeki Amdouni are long-term absentees.

Players out: Burnley - Amdouni, Beyer, Roberts

Doubts: Wolves - Chiwome

Key FPL notes:

While Hugo Bueno (Â£4.4m) is one of the leading FPL defenders for chances created (11), it's his defensive team-mate Ladislav Krejci (Â£4.5m) who has emerged as perhaps the greatest all-around attacking threat from Wolves' backline. Since his first Premier League start in Gameweek 4, the Czech Republic international and Girona loanee has combined five shots (including two versus Sunderland last weekend), with four chances created.

Burnley's Josh Cullen (Â£5.0m), meanwhile, has earned DefCon points in five of his eight appearances so far, but it's his midfield team-mate Luis Florentino (Â£5.0m) - who made his debut in Gameweek 4 and hasn't left the starting line-up since Gameweek 5 - that is currently averaging more clearances, blocks, interceptions, recoveries and tackles (CBIRTs) per 90 minutes than any other FPL midfielder with more than one start to their name in 2025-26.

Elsewhere for the Clarets, bargain pick Axel Tuanzebe (Â£3.9m) started ahead of Hjalmar Ekdal (Â£4.0m) in Scott Parker's defence for the second straight match in Gameweek 8, duly registering a clean sheet plus defensive contribution points.

Everton are boosted by the return of loanee Jack Grealish, who was ineligible to face his parent club Manchester City last weekend.

Manager David Moyes has no fresh injury concerns but defenders Jarrad Branthwaite and Nathan Patterson have both suffered setbacks in their rehabilitation.

Tottenham are missing nine players, although Cristian Romero, Destiny Udogie and Dominic Solanke are close to being available.

Players out: Everton - Branthwaite, Patterson Tottenham - Bissouma, Davies, Dragusin, Kulusevski, Maddison, Romero, Solanke, Takai, Udogie

Key FPL notes:

Everton's penalty-taking midfielder Iliman Ndiaye (Â£6.5m) registered their only shot on target against Man City last weekend and also created a team-high two chances, at least one of which should have resulted in an opener. Ndiaye also racked up a match-high 17 defensive contributions that afternoon, furthering his status as a true FPL all-rounder.

Despite letting slip their lead to lose at home, Spurs restricted Gameweek 8 opponents Aston Villa to just two shots on target and 0.37 xG. That's a marked improvement on the majority of their other performances this season, when goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario (Â£5.1m) - save-less on this occasion - has been called into action on a total of 24 occasions (the most of any top-six team).

Mohammed Kudus (Â£6.8m) has touched the ball more times in the final third of the pitch (253) than any Premier League player this season. He has also attempted (62) and completed (30) more take-ons and boasts more attacking returns - six, a goal and a league-high tally of five assists - than anyone except Haaland and Semenyo.

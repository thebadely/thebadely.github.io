England 'undersold' ourselves today - Wane

It is never a good sign when a head coach describes an international fixture involving his team as "torture".

Shaun Wane was clearly hurting after watching his England side suffer a comprehensive 26-6 defeat by Australia at Wembley in the first Ashes match for 22 years.

In truth, it could have been a lot worse. Australia started slowly and led by only eight points at half-time but eased clear in the second half while England wasted chances and made simple mistakes.

Australia will retain the Ashes if they beat England at Hill Dickinson Stadium in Liverpool next weekend - and they are not out of second gear yet.

"They are very disappointed in the dressing room," Wane told his post-match media conference of his players. "I really wanted to see the best of our players, but we undersold ourselves today. That's torture for me."

The gap in quality between the sides was illustrated by the first actions of the respective full-backs in the second half.

Reece Walsh, who was player of the match, carried the ball 80 metres following a slip by England's much-vaunted scrum-half Mikey Lewis. While England resisted the initial thrust, the ground gained provided the platform for Australia to score a killer second try of the match.

"Reece Walsh has saved two tries and he has scored two," former England forward James Graham told BBC One. "Let's not forget that break he made at the beginning of the second half, which set the tone."

The try resulting from that break was scored by second row Angus Crichton, who evaded England full back Jack Welsby to score.

In contrast to the forward-thinking Walsh, Welsby was caught out. He backed off Crichton until his heels were on the try line; when he made a limp attempt to tackle his man, it was far too late.

That is what tortured Wane the most - not being outclassed by the world number one international side and clear favourites for this series, but being outfought.

"I know what these players are capable of, but we didn't give ourselves a chance to win," he said. "It hurts a lot; we didn't put our best show on today. What we did wrong are easy fixes.

"They outplayed and outkicked us. It is easy to fix but has a knock-on effect. It was simple rugby; we did not nail the details."

Australia dominate England in first Ashes Test

Changes will surely be made before England play at Everton's new home next Saturday. AJ Brimson could come in for Welsby at full back, while Harry Smith - the usual central partner for captain George Williams - could also return.

Williams and Super League Grand Final star Lewis coped well with ball in hand, but their kicking was poor. Given England's clearest first-half openings came via grubber kicks, it is something which will need urgent improvement.

And all this is without acknowledging than Man of Steel Jake Connor has been left out of the England squad for this series entirely. A big decision by Wane, and one that will continue to be picked over as the series progresses.

As for Australia, this was business as usual. They have not lost to England since 1995, or to a British side since 2006 - when Brian Noble's side won a Tri-Nations contest in Sydney.

On this form, Australia will fancy significantly extending an unbeaten Test series run on UK soil that stands at 66 years.

And the best is yet to come, coach Kevin Walters says.

"It was a bit scrappy - we expect us to get better, and the English side will too," Walters told his post-match media conference. "Our defence was good, which makes me happier for than anything.

"There's no relief. I am in a strong position as the coach of this side. These guys give you confidence. they handled the pressure well and then will get on for next week."

The only downside for Walters is that captain Isaah Yeo will be absent next weekend after suffering a category one head injury during the first half following a clash with Dom Young.

"Yeo is with us, but had a bad knock," the coach said. "We have good medical staff then we will see where he is at in the next couple of days. Isaah is a tough hombre."

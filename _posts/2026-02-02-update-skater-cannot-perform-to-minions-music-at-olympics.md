Let's dive into the details: Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate has a best finish of 20th at the Figure Skating World Championships

Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate will not be able to perform to his usual music - a Minions mix - at the 2026 Winter Olympics because of a copyright issue.

Sabate, known for his flamboyant and unusual routines, will represent Spain in the men's event in Milan.

Throughout the 2025-26 season, the 26-year-old has performed to songs from the Minions animated film series while wearing a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls, similar to the characters' outfits.

But he announced via Instagram, external on Monday that he will not be able to perform to it at the Olympics as rights holders Universal Pictures have not given permission.

"Unfortunately, just days before the Olympic inauguration, I was informed that I am no longer permitted to use this program due to copyright clearance issues," Sabate said. 

Whatâs happening when at the Winter Olympics?

"Finding this out last Friday, so close to the biggest competition of my life, was incredibly disappointing.

"Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.

"To my fans: I wish I had better news, but I'm grateful beyond words for your support this season. I promise to step on the ice with everything I have and deliver programs that both you and I can be proud of."

The routine in Sabate's short program - the first of two routines in singles figure skating - has proved a hit in competitions around the world, including in Sheffield at the 2026 European Figure Skating Championships, where he finished 18th but became a fan favourite.

Sabate, a six-time Spanish champion set to make his Olympic debut in Milan, said he followed all required procedures and submitted the music through the ISU's ClicknClear system in August.

It leaves him just days to make changes to his program before the men's event starts in Milan on 10 February.

Sabate may use a mix of music by the Bee Gees for his short program, as this was the routine he performed to in 2024-25. However this is complicated, as he also performs to songs by the pop group in his free skate - the second part of his routine.

The International Skating Union said it was aware of the situation.

"As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate," they said in a statement. "Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports.

"While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear, we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music."

The International Olympic Committee has been contacted for comment.

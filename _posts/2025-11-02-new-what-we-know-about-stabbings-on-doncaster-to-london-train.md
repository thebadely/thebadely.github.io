It has been recently reported that Passengers travelling from Doncaster to London were attacked in a mass stabbing on a train on Saturday night.

Eleven people received treatment in hospital following the attack. One - a member of the train staff - is in a life-threatening condition. 

Two British men in their 30s were initially arrested while police said there was  "nothing to suggest" it was a terror incident.

One has since been released with no further action.

Witnesses reported that police used a Taser on one man who was holding a knife.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the attack was "appalling" and "deeply concerning".

Here is what we know so far about what happened.

The attack took place on the 18:25 GMT London North Eastern Railway (LNER) service from Doncaster, South Yorkshire to London's King's Cross station.

Passengers said one person brandishing a knife began stabbing people on the train after it passed through Peterborough in Cambridgeshire.

Cambridgeshire Police received the first call from passengers on board at 19:39, and the British Transport Police (BTP) was also alerted at 19:42.

The train made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon, which is around 15 minutes from Peterborough by train.

Armed police boarded the train and arrested the two men within eight minutes of the call to BTP. Police later said a knife was recovered from the scene.

A large emergency service response, including air ambulances, attended.

The driver of the train, who has since been identified as Andrew Johnson - a former Chief Petty Officer in the Royal Navy - contacted the control room from his cab to get the train diverted from the fast track to the slow track when the alarm was raised.

It meant the train could stop at a platform in Huntingdon.

Uninjured passengers were interviewed by police and some boarded a coach bound for London.

Huntingdon MP Ben Obese-Jecty told the BBC there were about 10 ambulances, several fire engines and "well over 20 police cars" when he first arrived at the scene just after 21:00.

National Rail said the station would remain closed until the end of the day on Monday.

The empty train was seen at the platform on Sunday along with a police presence and forensics tents.

Following the incident, Supt John Loveless of the British Transport Police said two UK nationals, men aged 32 and 35, were arrested at the scene.

In a later update on Sunday evening, British Transport Police said the 35-year-old, from London, had been released with no further action.

The force said it had been reported "in good faith" to responding officers that he had been involved. 

"Following inquiries we can confirm that he was not involved," it added.

The 32-year-old remains in police custody after having been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

He has not been named but police previously said he is a black British national.

The suspect is from Peterborough and boarded the train at Peterborough station.

Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said specialist detectives are looking into the background of the suspect and the events that led up to the attack.

Emergency crews took 10 people to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge - which is some 30 minutes away from the train station - and one person later went to the hospital for treatment. 

Shortly before 18:00 on Sunday, police said five people had been discharged from hospital and one remained in a "life-threatening condition".

"This casualty is a member of LNER rail staff who was on the train at the time and tried to stop the attacker," the police said.

"Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people's lives."

No victims have been named.

Witnesses told the BBC of panic and confusion as passengers ran through the carriages, some wounded and bloodied.

Alistair Day, 58, told the BBC he hid in the buffet car with about 11 other passengers while the attacker attempted to gain entry.

He said one passenger turned to him and calmly said he had been stabbed in the chest: "He had blood all over him, so we put pressure and stuff and held him."

Olly Foster said he heard people shouting "run, there's a guy stabbing literally everyone and everything" and thought at first it might have been a Halloween prank.

He saw an older man with gashes on his head and neck after he "blocked" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl. Passengers used their jackets to try and staunch the bleeding.

Nottingham University student Amira Ostalski was on the train with her friend.

She said when they got off the train as it came to a stop at Huntingdon she thought she would be safe but then she noticed the man - thought to be the attacker - jumping over a fence and running towards them.

"Police came and detained him right in front of my eyes," she said. 

Ms Ostalski added she would feel "vulnerable" if she were to sit on a train again.

British Transport Police (BTP) declared a major incident and initially said counter-terrorism officers were supporting the investigation "to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident".

The force said it had at one point declared "Plato" - the national code word used by emergency services when responding to a "marauding terror attack" - but later rescinded it.

Supt Loveless later said at a press conference that there was "nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident".

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the "appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning".

He wrote on X: "My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response."

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also said her thoughts were with the victims, their friends and family, and praised the emergency workers who responded.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC she was "horrified" by the attack, saying: "I can only imagine how frightening it must have been to be in an enclosed environment with someone rampaging in that fashion."

She urged people not to speculate about the incident, while questioning why "we're seeing more and more violence on our streets" despite efforts to tackle knife crime.

King Charles issued a statement saying he and Queen Camilla extended their "deepest sympathy" to those affected and their loved ones.

LNER urged passengers to check before travelling on Sunday due to possible cancellations or changes to services.

Tickets for Saturday and Sunday will be valid until Friday, and those who no longer want to travel this week can get a refund.

National Rail has warned that LNER services between London Kings Cross and Peterborough may be cancelled, revised or delayed.

A rail replacement service is in place to and from Huntingdon station.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said passengers would see a "high visibility presence" of police at stations and on trains throughout the day "to reassure the public".

Government sources told the PA news agency there will be a "surge" in police presence until at least Tuesday in core transport hubs across the country such as London, Birmingham and Manchester, in addition to Huntingdon.

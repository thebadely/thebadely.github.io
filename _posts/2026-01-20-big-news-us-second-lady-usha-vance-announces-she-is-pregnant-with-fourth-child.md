Let's dive into the details: Usha Vance, the wife of Vice-President JD Vance, has announced she is pregnant with her fourth child. 

In a post on X, the second lady said she is looking forward to welcoming a boy in late July. 

"Usha and the baby are doing well," a statement posted on Tuesday to the second lady's social media account read. 

Vance and his wife, Usha, 40, have three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.

Usha Vance (née Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.

She met JD Vance as a student at Yale Law School in 2010, when they joined a discussion group on "social decline in white America".

Before becoming second lady, Usha Vance had a legal career, including a job as a corporate litigator at firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in San Francisco. She also worked for conservative judges, Chief Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court and appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, before he was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court. 

Usha Vance is the first to have a baby as second lady, though other first ladies have had children while their husbands were in office. 

First lady Frances Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, gave birth to daughter Esther in the White House in 1893, followed by a second child, Marion, who was born outside the White House. 

JD Vance has been one of the most vocal members of the Trump administration in calling for higher birth rates in the US. 

"Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America," he said in 2025.

Let's dive into the details: England face Jamaica in December in a four-match series

England were "really flat" as they suffered a 55-49 defeat in the deciding game of their three-match series against New Zealand in Manchester.

The Roses secured a thrilling victory on Sunday to level the series after New Zealand had won the opening match on Saturday.

But in front of an enthusiastic home crowd at AO Arena, England struggled to keep their error count down as the Silver Ferns' efficiency and patience paid off.

The Roses led after the opening quarter, the first time they have done so at the end of a quarter in a match all series, but failed to assert themselves from there.

Head coach Jess Thirlby said: "Really flat. I did feel like we played a bit within ourselves. I still felt like there was way more to come. 

"I felt both teams were a bit hesitant at the start of the game. [We were] maybe a little bit slow to adjust. 

"There's a lot for us to learn about ourselves in showing up for games like this where things are on the line. We never really found our feet. It was a bit of a flat end to what I think has been an excellent series."

In a cagey first quarter, both sides struggled to keep hold of the ball but the Roses edged a 14-11 lead.

The Silver Ferns quickly closed that gap in quarter two as England were punished for their sloppiness and errors began to accumulate.

Thirlby shuffled the attack end to try to change the momentum, Helen Housby replacing Olivia Tchine at goal shooter as England lacked the potency under the post they had shown in game two.

But the hosts could not prevent New Zealand turning the tables and taking a two-goal lead into half-time.

England rallied after the break, much to the delight of an enthusiastic home crowd, as London Pulse defensive duo Halimat Adio and Funmi Fadoju worked hard to win the ball back and Housby and Lois Pearson combined well in the shooting circle.

But the Roses let things slip in the final couple of minutes of the third quarter, losing their way and allowing New Zealand to take a 42-38 lead going into the final period.

Fadoju claimed a loose Silver Ferns pass early in the final quarter as England tried to claw back the deficit. But defensive hard work was not always rewarded with goals at the other end as New Zealand further stretched their lead.

England's shooters failed to replicate the efficient display of Sunday, recording an uncharacteristically low 83% shooting accuracy while three losses of possession were because of sloppy passing.

"The really disappointing thing is we gave them more ball today and it was cheap ball, it was missed shots that we're not accustomed to," said Thirlby.

"We couldn't find the ball. If we found it, we didn't score off it. If we were starting to get a foothold in the game, we missed a shot."

Shooter Grace Nweke, who has enjoyed a fruitful series, was consistent under the post while Maddy Gordon shone at centre.

Thirlby made changes in attack but no combination had the desired effect and the Roses could not close the gap.

They will face Jamaica in December before taking on South Africa in January as they continue to build up to the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Let's dive into the details: President Emmanuel Macron has named close ally Sébastien Lecornu as the new French prime minister, 24 hours after a vote of confidence ousted François Bayrou as head of government.

Lecornu, 39, was among the favourites to take over, and he has spent the past three years as armed forces minister focusing on France's response to Russia's war in Ukraine.

In a statement the Elysée Palace said Lecornu - the seventh PM in the Macron presidency - had been given the task of consulting political parties with the aim of adopting France's next budget.

Pushing through a budget as head of a minority government was what brought down Bayrou, with left and far-right opponents condemning Lecornu's appointment.

Bayrou had visited the president hours earlier to hand in his resignation, paving the way for Sébastien Lecornu to become the fifth prime minister of Macron's second term as president.

Lecornu wrote on social media that he had been entrusted by the president with "building a government with clear direction: defending our independence and our strength, serving the French people, and [ensuring] political and institutional stability for the unity of our country".

His immediate task is tackling France's spiralling public debt, which hit €3.3tn (£2.8tn) earlier this year and represents 114% of the country's economic output or GDP. 

Bayrou had proposed €44bn in budget cuts, and his decision to put his plans to a vote of confidence was always going to fail. In the end France's National Assembly decided to oust his government by 364 votes to 194.

Lecornu's appointment was welcomed by centrist allies such as Marc Fesneau from Bayrou's MoDem party. He called on every political force to reach a compromise - "for the stability of the country and its recovery, especially its budget".

Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left France Unbowed was unimpressed, complaining that nothing had changed and it was time for Macron's departure from the presidency.

There had been suggestions that Macron might try to approach the centre left to broaden his minority government, and Olivier Faure of the Socialists had offered his services the night before. 

It soon became clear that Faure would not be getting the call: "I slept pretty soundly so I didn't hear the phone ring."

On the far right, Marine Le Pen said the president was ”giving Macronism its last shot from his bunker, along with his little circle of loyalists".

France has had a hung parliament since Macron surprised his country by calling snap national elections last year, after a poor performance in the June 2024 European vote. There are broadly three main political blocs: the left, far right and the centre.

Édouard Philippe, who was Macron's first prime minister from 2017-20, thought Lecornu was a good choice as he had learned a lot as defence minister.

"I've known him for a long time because he was elected like me in Normandy," the Horizons party leader told TF1 TV. "He knows how to debate and he'll need this talent for debate and listening to find a deal in circumstances he knows are pretty complicated."

Philippe believed Lecornu would have to find some way of bringing the Socialists on board. It was certainly possible to find a majority and also necessary, he thought, because without a compromise on a budget deal, a fresh political crisis would erupt and new elections would be inevitable.

More immediately, a grassroots movement called Bloquons Tout - "Let's Block Everything" - is planning widespread anti-government protests on Wednesday and authorities are planning to deploy 80,000 police.

Then on Friday the credit agency Fitch will reassess France's debts and could make its borrowing costs higher if it lowers its rating from AA-.

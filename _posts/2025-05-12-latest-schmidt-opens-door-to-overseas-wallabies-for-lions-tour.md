According to new developments, James O'Connor, who has also played his club rugby at Sale, Toulon and London Irish, is currently with New Zealand's Crusaders

Australia might relax their preference for fielding Australian-based players to give themselves the best shot of beating the British and Irish Lions in this summer's series.

The Wallabies have generally opted for players either at domestic teams, or with a commitment to return to play in the country.

The policy was previously formalised as 'Giteau's Law' - a limit on the number of players an Australian head coach could pick from overseas, which varied on the number of caps individuals had won - but it has been loosened in recent years., external

Back row Langi Gleeson, who played in all four of Australia's November internationals, had his invitation to a training camp rescinded in January after it was reported he had agreed a move to French side Montpellier.

However, Schmidt says the strength of the Lions squad announced last week might mean he takes a softer line with overseas talent.

"We don't want to discount anyone because, as [Lions head coach] Andy [Farrell's] done and the coaches, they've picked a form squad," said Schmidt.

"I stay in touch with those guys who are overseas.

"We would love to pick a form squad. 

"But, as I've always said, if there's anything that we think is 50-50, it's more difficult to absorb someone from the outside the groups that play together already."

Former Saracens second row Will Skelton, now with La Rochelle, Bordeaux's in-form back row Peter Samu and Japan-based centre Samu Kerevi are among those who could benefit.

James O'Connor, 34, who was Australia's starting fly-half in all three Tests of the series defeat by the Lions in 2013, has also run into form with New Zealand's Crusaders.

Schmidt suffered two injury scares over the weekend with Noah Lolesio, his first-choice 10, and big-money league convert Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii both carried out of Super Rugby matches on stretchers.

While Suaalii has suffered a concussion that will keep him out of action for about two weeks as he goes through return-to-play protocols, Lolesio's availability for the Lions series is less clear.

"We are pleased to report that scans have cleared him of any serious injury," Lolesio's Brumbies team said about the 25-year-old's back injury.

"Noah is in good spirits and will continue to be monitored by the club's medical team over the coming days. A timeline for his return to play will be determined based on ongoing assessment and symptom resolution."

Suaalii was described as 'fairly groggy' by Waratahs coach Dan McKellar after being concussed in a collision with a team-mate

Schmidt also admitted he had been impressed by Henry Pollock's rise, with the 20-year-old back row going from age-grade international rugby and a fringe squad member at Northampton to being named in the Lions' 38-strong squad last Thursday in only a matter of months.

"He is a very, very promising player," said Schmidt. 

"Considering he was playing in the England Under-20s at the start of the Six Nations and came through and ended up playing for the senior side, not many players get to do that, particularly not in the forwards."

According to new developments, A series of cost-of-living roadshows is taking place in a county's libraries, schools and churches.

The events are being organised by West Northamptonshire Council, which says they are "a vital way to connect with residents".

The authority says the roadshows will offer advice on everything from family finances to mental health support.

They start on 10 June and finish a month later.

While a 2024 report found that West Northamptonshire had lower levels of deprivation than the England average, there are some areas where poverty is still a major problem.

King's Heath in Northampton was identified by MPs as one of 225 "left behind" areas in the country in 2022. 

The Northampton districts of Talavera and Queensway were also on the list.

Even in rural areas, which are often seen as more affluent, there are pockets of deprivation.

More than 14,000 people in rural Northamptonshire are seen as income deprived, while the town of Towcester shows high levels of food insecurity.

The roadshow will visit four less affluent areas of Northampton as well as two villages.

Laura Couse, the council's cabinet member for public health, said: "We understand that the rising cost of living continues to affect many households, and no one should feel they have to face these difficulties alone. That's why we're bringing together a wide range of local organisations and services under one roofâ€”to make it easier for people to access the help they need.

"These events are a vital way for us to connect with residents and ensure they know what support is available during these challenging times."

The advice available includes energy-saving tips, debt management advice and mental health resources.

The council said its cost of living support hub was also available for people who could not attend a roadshow.

The sessions are:

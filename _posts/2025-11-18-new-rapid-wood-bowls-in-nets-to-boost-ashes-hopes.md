'He nearly took my head off!' - Jamie Smith and Josh Tongue on Mark Wood's return

Mark Wood's chances of playing in the first Ashes Test look to be increasing after the England paceman bowled a "rapid" spell in the nets in Perth on Tuesday.

Wood has not played a Test since August 2024 and felt tightness in his left hamstring during England's only Ashes warm-up match.

After being cleared of any concerns over a hamstring injury by a scan, the 35-year-old took part in England's first training session at Optus Stadium.

With heavy strapping on his left knee - he had surgery earlier this year - Wood first bowled off a few paces then built up to what appeared to be full speed off his full run.

Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who faced Wood in the nets, said: "He was absolutely rapid today. I can tell you that first hand.

"He's definitely one to avoid on the netting list. He was near enough full tilt, so it's good signs for us."

England may confirm their XI for Friday's first Test against Australia on Wednesday.

Wood could be part of a five-man England pace attack on what is expected to be a lively surface. On Wednesday, the West Australian newspaper carried a picture of the Perth pitch on its front page, calling it a "green monster".

Ten names seem set for the tourists: the regular top seven, including fit-again captain Ben Stokes, plus seamers Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson.

If England omit Wood, his place could go to fellow seamer Josh Tongue or spin-bowling all-rounder Will Jacks.

Tongue said he could see no reason why Wood will not be fit for the first Test.

"If his body's all good and the management think he's good to go, I don't see why not," said Tongue.

'It felt like God's hand on my brain' - the day England were humbled by teenager

'England will win Ashes if Stokes plays full part'

Wood, one of the fastest bowlers to play Test cricket for England, has a chequered injury history.

His latest spell out of the Test side began 15 months ago with an elbow problem. When the Durham man made his return in white-ball cricket at the beginning of this year, he sustained the knee injury that required surgery.

While his inclusion would come with an element of risk, England will be keen to include him for his pace, previous success against Australia and the importance of starting the series well.

If England do field five seamers, Wood's workload can be balanced by the other four. It would arguably be harder to play him later in the series when a spinner is needed, meaning there are only three other pace bowlers to share the load.

Wood was included as one of five seamers - including all-rounder Stokes - for England's only warm-up game against England Lions at Lilac Hill last week.

He bowled eight overs in two spells of four on the first day - a workload that England said was pre-planned - but left the field midway through the afternoon session.

He had a scan and received the all-clear on Saturday morning, but played no further part in the tour game.

Australia are set to be without captain Pat Cummins and fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood for the series opener, with Brendan Doggett in line for a debut.

Cummins, who is recovering from a back injury, has been bowling in the Perth nets as he builds towards a potential return in the second Test in Brisbane on 4 December.

Wicketkeeper Alex Carey did not rule out Cummins springing a surprise and playing the first Test, but it is understood the skipper will remain on the sidelines.

"The thing for Pat is the workload and getting enough overs in his legs, making sure there are no other injuries from bowling," said Carey.

"It looked like his rhythm was there. It's great to see and for him to the around the group - he's a fantastic leader. 

"It's looking like he's preparing really well. It would be great to see him back playing soon."

Wood appeared to be bowling at close to full tilt during the net session

A green monster? The colour of the Perth pitch is probably nothing the England team have not seen at an early season County Championship match. The variable thing will be the bounce - green grass and steepling lift is a devilish proposition for a batter.

Pitches can also change considerably in the days leading up to a Test. On Wednesday, the surface was left uncovered, open to the sunshine. It has already begun to turn a lighter shade of green.

There were murmurings of England's plan to play five seamers in this Test as far back as the home summer. The tourists appeared to reveal their hand by including a quintet for the only warm-up match against England Lions at Lilac Hill last week.

The last time they fielded such an attack was in the controversial Ashes Test at Lord's two years ago. That was partly out of necessity. Spinners Jack Leach and Moeen Ali were injured, while captain Ben Stokes was hampered by a knee injury that would eventually require surgery.

On this occasion, spinners Shoaib Bashir and Will Jacks are probably not of the quality that could enhance England's attack in these conditions. It feels right to unleash what would be the fastest England attack to play an Ashes Test in this country for decades.

The five should include Mark Wood, who could not have done much more in the nets on Tuesday. Naturally, there is an element of risk in fielding a bowler who has not played in a Test for 15 months, but that risk will not be diminished by saving him.

Wood can be protected by the four other seamers, rather than having to shoulder a greater burden when a spinner is selected later in the series. England have to start well. They have to push all of their chips on to the table - and that includes Wood.

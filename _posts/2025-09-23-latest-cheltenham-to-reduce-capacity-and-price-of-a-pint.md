According to new developments, More than 200,000 spectators attend the four-day Cheltenham Festival

Organisers of the Cheltenham Festival are to reduce capacity and the price of a pint following criticism from spectators.

The four-day meeting in March is the showpiece of the jump racing calendar, but it has experienced a marked decline in attendances with punters unhappy about cost.

A pint of draught beer or cider will be reduced by 30p to Â£7.50 at all the course's meetings this season.

The Festival's final day, featuring the Cheltenham Gold Cup, was sold out this year but some people complained of overcrowding on that day.

Daily capacity will be reduced from 68,500 to 66,000, although no attendance on the first three days in 2025 topped 56,000.

The price of drinks, and particularly Guinness â with an estimated 265,000 pints sold during the week - has been a particular sore point among punters.

"We regularly benchmark our food and beverage prices alongside other major sports venues and comparable events," said course chief executive Guy Lavender.

"Despite being subject to the same increases in goods and services as all industries, we have taken the decision to reduce the price of draught beers and cider... for the 2025/26 season."

He said the reduction would bring prices down to 2022 levels.

For comparison, a pint of beer at this year's Wimbledon tennis was Â£8.45, while it would have set you back Â£7.75 at golf's Open Championship.

Cheltenham make changes to 'improve' Festival

Absent regulars have cited the cost of accommodation, tickets, travel and food and drink - plus overcrowding in previous years - as reasons for missing the meeting, which was extended to four days from three in 2005.

Thousands have travelled to Spanish destinations, including Benidorm and Tenerife, to watch the action on big screens, saying a week in the sunshine is cheaper than attending the fixture.

A year ago, organisers announced changes aimed at improving competition in races and the experience of racegoers, and further changes are likely.

A new park-and-ride system, additional coaches and extra hardstanding areas at the course for car parking were introduced.

Cheltenham says it will go back to promoting its second day, which it had renamed as 'Style Wednesday', as Ladies' Day for the first time since 2019.

Two bars within the main grandstand, Cottage Rake and Mill House, will be refurbished and reopen at the Showcase meeting in October as one new bar named Prestbury View. A new covered food court will be introduced in the tented village.

Investment has been committed to the PA system so racegoers can hear the commentary more clearly, with more live information and data on big screens.

Additional discounted ticket windows will be available, offering the opportunity to buy early at a reduced rate for longer.

There will be an expanded 'Room to Race' programme, aimed at offering accommodation at more affordable rates.

Lifting of restrictions will be extended so racegoers can move more freely with drinks around the venue.

The 'super early bird prices' for the 2026 Festival in the month after this year's meeting ranged from Â£35-Â£83 for each of the first three days, and Â£50-99 for the Friday.

On the day, it will cost between Â£70 and Â£126 for Tuesday to Thursday and Â£89 to Â£149 for Gold Cup day.

The total attendance for the week was significantly down on the record 280,000 that attended the first post-Covid meeting open to spectators in 2022.

A crowd of 41,949 on the Wednesday was the lowest daily total since 1993.

Crowds in 2025 (2024 in brackets and then 2022)

Tuesday: 55,498 (60,181) 68,567

Wednesday: 41,949 (46,771) 64,431

Thursday: 53,366 (53,918) 73,754

Friday: 68,026 (69,129) 73,875

Total: 218,839 (229,999) 280,627

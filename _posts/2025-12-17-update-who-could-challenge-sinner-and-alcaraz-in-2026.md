Here’s what you need to know: Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2025, while Carlos Alcaraz claimed the French Open and US Open

Dominance at the top of the men's game is nothing new.

As age caught up with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, thoughts turned to the void left by the 'Big Three', who won 66 of the 78 Grand Slams held between 2004 and 2023.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have shattered any expectation of the men's majors being blown wide open.

The pair have swept the past eight Grand Slams and dominated the ATP Tour, leading to one question: can anybody stop them in 2026?

"I see a lot of guys who can start to become a threat if they progress, but to say this person will be a threat next season is difficult," Patrick Mouratoglou, who coached 23-time major singles champion Serena Williams between 2012 and 2022, told BBC Sport.

"If you look at the margin those two guys have above the other players, it's difficult to imagine."

BBC Sport picks out five players who could potentially end the 'Sincaraz' duopoly next season.

At the bottom of the page, you can have your say and predict the next men's Grand Slam champion outside of the pair - plus when and where it will be.

Alcaraz announces shock split with coach Ferrero

Ben Shelton won the biggest title of his career at the Canadian Open in July

Age: 23 

World ranking: 9

Career Slam highlights: 2023 US Open semi-finalist, 2025 Australian Open semi-finalist

With serves touching 150mph and plenty of on-court sass, Shelton announced himself with his run to the New York semi-finals in 2023.

The left-handed American reached another Grand Slam semi-final in Melbourne this year, but came unstuck against Sinner.

His progress at the next two majors was blocked by Alcaraz at Roland Garros and Sinner again at Wimbledon.

"I think the next guy will have to have a huge ego if he wants to be in the mix - so it can be someone like Shelton, maybe," said Mouratoglou.

"He will have to make progress but I think his confidence in himself and in his game is big enough."

Former British number one Greg Rusedski agrees Shelton has the "firepower" to win a major.

"But only if he makes the improvements on his backhand, his court positioning and plays the big points better," Rusedski added.

Taylor Fritz's two titles in 2025 - Stuttgart and Eastbourne - both came on grass courts

Age: 28 

World ranking: 6

Career Slam highlights: 2024 US Open finalist

Fritz has been a staple in the top 20 for the past four seasons, with a game built around a serve that was ranked second on the ATP Tour in 2025.

An aggressive approach from the baseline supports the American's opening shot, with a steely drive and work ethic underpinning his consistency.

Fritz's problem so far has been simple: his level is not as high as Alcaraz or Sinner's.

He has won just two of his 11 matches against the pair - one victory over each but none at a major - but is seen as the "likeliest to close the gap" by former world number four Tim Henman. 

"He's so efficient on serve and at the back of the court, both forehand and backhand, but [he needs to] try to finish a few points at the net when he's so aggressive from those groundstrokes," Henman said on Netflix's coverage of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event.

"He's brought in the drop shot a little bit, which is good to get the opponents moving forward to backwards, not just side to side."

Jack Draper won his first Masters title - the tier of tournaments below the Grand Slams - at Indian Wells in March

Age: 23 

World ranking: 10

Career highlights: 2024 US Open semi-finalist

Draper's promise is illustrated by him finishing 2025 as the world number 10, despite playing only 11 tournaments.

With his left-handed serve and forehand able to puncture the defence of most opponents, the British number one has beaten both Sinner and Alcaraz over three sets - including the latter on his way to Indian Wells glory in March.

"Someone like - and I've got my biased hat on here - a fully fit Jack has weapons," Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith told BBC Sport.

"I think it helps the fact he's a leftie. There's big serving, big cuts of the ball. 

"He can beat them - we've seen it before in one-off matches. 

"But to win the Slams you are probably going to have to beat one of Sinner or Alcaraz in the semi-finals and then beat the other one in the final - that's the biggest challenge."

Felix Auger-Aliassime has reached a career-high ranking after a stunning finish to 2025

Age: 25

World ranking: 5

Career Slam highlights: 2021 & 2025 US Open semi-finals

When Auger-Aliassime reached his first Grand Slam semi-final in 2021, it felt like he was primed for the very top.

However, his progress was derailed by a string of injuries and a lack of belief at the biggest events.

The Canadian started 2025 outside of the world's top 20, but his game - booming serve, vicious groundstrokes and supreme athleticism - came together late in the season.

He surged into the top five after reaching the US Open semis, claiming the Brussels title and losing to Sinner in the Paris Masters final.

"I like the way he has matured in the past three to four months and how he played at the US Open," said Tennis Channel analyst Mark Petchey.

"He has got big weapons. I look at Jannik and Carlos and if you don't come with firepower, they are going to get you every single time."

Novak Djokovic won his 101st career singles title at the Hellenic Championships, but has not won a major since the 2023 US Open

Age: 38 

World ranking: 4

Career Slam highlights: 24-time major singles titles

That Djokovic consistently looks the most likely to disrupt the 'New Two' is testament to his enduring brilliance.

It is also damning about the rest of the pack.

"Despite barely playing, he was still the third-best player on the planet this year, and he still wants to keep going," Rusedski said.

By his own admission, Djokovic's problem going into 2026 is beating Sinner and Alcaraz over five sets.

Somehow, the Serb managed to oust Alcaraz at this year's Australian Open and Melbourne - where Djokovic is a 10-time champion - perhaps represents his best chance to win a standalone record 25th major title.

Germany's Alexander Zverev is the nearest challenger in terms of ranking and has long been predicted to win a Grand Slam.

However, the 28-year-old has regularly shown he lacks the belief to get over the line - including three defeats in major finals.

And what about the precocious talents emerging?

Brazil's Joao Fonseca, 19, is tipped for big things but is far from the finished product, while 20-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik - who beat Djokovic in the Miami final - is the youngest player in the world's top 20.

"They're not ready at the moment to win a Slam, they are still so far away from the top two," Rusedski added.

According to new developments, Jordan Nobbs scored seven goals in 67 games in two and a half seasons at Aston Villa

Jordan Nobbs has joined Women's Super League 2 side Newcastle following her release from Aston Villa.

The 32-year-old midfielder has made a record 208 appearances in the Women's Super League (WSL), and has 71 England caps, the last coming in 2023. 

Nobbs, from north-east England, began her career at Sunderland before moving to Arsenal in 2010 and went on to win three WSL titles and four FA Cups in 12 years with the Gunners.

She scored 81 goals in 270 games before joining Villa in January 2023.

"I think they are a very ambitious club and, speaking to everyone, the goal is to get promoted and push women's football in the north east. I want to be part of that," she told Newcastle's official website.

"I've always had a winning mentality, and it's the same mentality here - every game is like a cup final. I want to be part of a successful club that push to the next level."

Manager Becky Langley added: "Jordan's experience speaks for itself. She knows what it takes to win and has achieved so much in her career, both domestically and internationally, and we are absolutely delighted that she is joining Newcastle United.

"She has long been one of the best midfielders in the country and she will undoubtedly bring a lot of quality to our squad."

Newcastle finished fifth in the Women's Championship, since rebranded as WSL2, last season.

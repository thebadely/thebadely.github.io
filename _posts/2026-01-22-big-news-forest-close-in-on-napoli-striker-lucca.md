Here’s what you need to know: Striker Lorenzo Lucca has also played for Pisa and Ajax

Nottingham Forest are closing in on the signing of Napoli striker Lorenzo Lucca.

The Premier League strugglers are poised to complete a loan deal with an option to buy for the Italy international.

Lucca only joined Napoli last July from Udinese, in a loan deal that included an obligation to buy., external

The 25-year-old was set to fly to England on Thursday in order to complete his move to Forest.

Boss Sean Dyche has been searching for a new striker, with no timeframe on the return of last season's 20-goal top scorer Chris Wood, sidelined following knee surgery in December.

Lucca has scored once in 16 Serie A appearances for Antonio Conte's side - although he has made just four starts - and has also netted once in the Coppa Italia. 

He scored 14 goals for Udinese last season but has struggled for game time under Conte after joining the defending champions. 

Forest are also interested in Lucca's Napoli team-mate Mathias Olivera as they assess their left-back options. 

Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen has also been considered by Forest this month, with the Norway international available for Â£40m. 

Forest are 17th in the Premier League, five points above the bottom three, and face Braga in Portugal in the Europa League on Thursday.

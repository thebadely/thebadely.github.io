Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A team from Brazil has won the Fifa Club World Cup on four occasions - but the last time was in 2012

"This Club World Cup is a dream come true for Brazil fans," says South American football expert Tim Vickery, speaking from Rio de Janeiro.

"Every bus stop, every water cooler... everyone is talking about it. It's full-on."

While Britain sleeps, with some games at the newly-expanded tournament in the United States kicking-off at 02:00 BST, Brazil is going wild for it. 

And no wonder.

Millions of football fans are glued to television sets following the fortunes of Rio-based teams Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense - as well as Palmeiras, who are based in Sao Paulo.

And it is a case of so far, so good.

All four have progressed from their respective groups to the last-16 after some eye-catching results which have left fans asking if a team from Brazil can win the Club World Cup for the first time since 2012?

Botafogo have beaten newly-crowned champions of Europe Paris St-Germain, Flamengo turned a 1-0 deficit into a 3-1 victory over Chelsea, while Fluminense  and Palmeiras have held Borussia Dortmund and Porto respectively.

The United States is hosting most of the games at the 2026 World Cup next summer. Canada and Mexico are also co-hosts.

If a team from Brazil wins the Club World Cup, what will that say about the chances of the Brazil national team winning the World Cup for a sixth time?

"I didn't expect that, most people in Brazil didn't expect that," Brazilian sports journalist Renata Mendonca, speaking to BBC World Service Sport, says about all four Brazilian teams advancing.

"The way they want to show the world... the Brazilian teams are good enough and could be at the top of the world.

"This motivates them a lot."

Will a South American team win the Club World Cup?

PSG stunned by Brazilian champions Botafogo

Palmeiras finished second in Brazil's top flight in 2024 

Atletico Madrid and Porto have already been sent packing, while both teams from Argentina - Boca Juniors and River Plate - have also been eliminated. 

Brazil's quartet, however, march on. 

At least one is guaranteed a place in the quarter-finals.

That's because Palmeiras and Botafogo have been drawn against one another in an all-Brazil showdown in Philadelphia on Saturday (17:00 BST kick-off).

Meanwhile, Flamengo face Bayern Munich on Sunday (21:00), while Fluminense meet Inter Milan on Monday (20:00).

"This tournament is a priority in the way an Olympic athlete will do all of his training and programming to peak at a specific time," Vickery tells BBC Sport.

"Certainly for Flamengo and Palmeiras, who really want to win it. This is an absolute priority for them and they have programmed to be at their peak now." 

Is the climate, which the Brazilian teams are used to, helping give them an edge?

Both Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca and Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola have mentioned the extreme heat since the tournament started.

Chelsea trained in 37C before their 3-0 group win over ES Tunis in Philadelphia.

"It is almost impossible to train or to make a session because of the weather," said Maresca earlier this week, while Guardiola said before Thursday's match with Juventus that his players must be prepared to "suffer" in the challenging heat of Orlando.

The soaring temperatures across the United States have led to matches across the competition implementing water breaks during games.

But not all players have struggled in the heat.

"We're used to it," Botafogo right-back Vitinho, who spent two years at Burnley, said of the high temperatures. "I hope that it works in our favour."

Another factor to consider is that all four teams from Brazil have broken away from their domestic season, which runs from March until December, to take part.

While they appear fresh and sharp, teams from Europe went into the Club World Cup on the back of long seasons. 

PSG's first game against Atletico Madrid in Pasadena on 15 June came 15 days after their 5-0 mauling of Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Munich.

Vickery adds: "A few weeks ago the Flamengo president was saying to a mate of mine 'we're flying in mid-season'. 

"For the European clubs... is it the end of their season? Is it pre-season? The European clubs, their planning hasn't been to peak now."

Vickery believes there is something else to factor into the conversation about Brazilian clubs doing well.

"There is more money in Brazilian football," he says.

"The standard has risen over the last few seasons. One reason is because of the influx of foreign coaches. 

"Of the four Brazilian clubs here - two have Portuguese coaches [Abel Ferreira - Palmeiras and Renato Paiva - Botafogo].

"There's plenty of Portuguese and Argentine coaches in Brazilian football and it's brought more ideas. Even Filipe Luis, the Brazilian coaching Flamengo, his backup staff are all Spanish. 

"There's an openness to new ideas that there wasn't a few years ago."

Mendonca adds: "The timing of this competition is very good for South American teams. They are in the middle of their season, they are very well prepared physically. 

"They have better conditions now to keep their talented players and even bring back some players. Flamengo, for example, signed Jorginho after leaving Arsenal, while Danilo and Alex Sandro have come from Juventus. 

"Also Botafogo, they have kept Igor Jesus for this competition. After this he will go to Nottingham Forest.

"These are aspects that explain why Brazilian teams are performing very well."

Flamengo, who beat Chelsea, are the current leaders in Brazil's top flight

Tens of thousands of fans have travelled from Brazil to cheer their respective clubs at the Club World Cup.

And they have proved one of the highlights of the tournament so far, with vibrant atmospheres at all of their games.

Brazil have already qualified for next summer's World Cup, but Vickery does not believe the performance of the club teams will have any bearing on how Carlo Ancelotti's side perform next year.

"What the performances of the Brazilian clubs highlight is the strength of national teams like Colombia and Uruguay," he adds.

"Palmeiras, Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense...a lot of their best players are not Brazilians. 

"The way that European football treats Brazil, Brazilian football now treats the rest of South America. You have got two of the midfielders for Colombia - Richard Rios of Palmeiras and Jhon Arias of Fluminense.

"Gustavo Gomez, a centre-back for Paraguay, plays for Palmeiras and Jefferson Savarino, who plays for Venezuela, made the goal for Botafogo against PSG.

"That's the model - Brazil sells its best players to Europe and one of the ways they replenish them is from neighbouring countries in South America."

Fluminense finished 13th in Brazil's top flight last season

Flamengo: Brazil's form team going in the tournament, topping this season's domestic league.

They earned their place in the tournament by winning the Copa Liberatodores in 2022, their third triumph.

They stunned Chelsea with a 3-1 win to finish top of their group unbeaten.

Fluminense: It has been a rollercoaster few years for Fluminense, having won the Copa Libertadores in 2023 for the first time.

They followed that up by almost being relegated from Brazil's top flight last season - just avoiding the embarrassment of being in the Club World Cup and the country's second tier.

This season they are sixth after 11 games and are captained by former Chelsea defender Thiago Silva. They also have the oldest player in the tournament, 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio.

Botafogo enjoyed a remarkable 2024 winning both Brazil's top flight and the Copa Libertadores

Palmeiras: One of South America's most popular club, they are no stranger to success during their 115-year history.

They have won 57 trophies, including three Copa Libertadores - the South American equivalent of the Champions League. They were the champions of Brazil most recently in 2023.

Their star player is 18-year-old forward Estevao, who will be joining Chelsea after the tournament, having previously sold Endrick to Real Madrid.

Botafogo: The big surprise team in the tournament so far after beating European champions PSG to win their group.

They dominated South America in 2024, winning both the Copa Libertadores and the Brazilian championship. This season has been a struggle though after the departure of key players.

Their rise, under the ownership of John Textor, has been remarkable going from debt ridden to top of the South American game.

Striker Igor Jesus remains though and is widely expected to join Nottingham Forest at the end of the tournament.

According to new developments, Harris English has a best Open Championship finish of 15th in 2013

American Harris English may be without caddie Eric Larson for next week's Open Championship at Royal Portrush after the bag man was denied entry to the UK.

English, the world number 19 golfer, said a letter is "sitting on someone's desk at the government somewhere" after the decision to stop Larson from travelling because of a drug conviction more than 30 years ago.

Larson served 10 years in prison for drug offences before he was released in 2006 - and he has caddied at the Open before.

But he now needs an exemption to the new Electronic Travel Authority visa rules in the UK.

"I guess the United Kingdom doesn't look highly on his past," English said.

"I didn't understand how complicated the process was. Someone could see this guy had something in his past 30 years ago, he's been fine the last 20.

"How long does this stay with him?"

English said multiple letters have been written to vouch for the caddie, including one from the office of the US Ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens.

"They [Stephens' office] wrote a letter. The R&A wrote a letter. The PGA Tour wrote a letter. A charity event Eric works for in the States wrote a letter," English said.

"It's not for a lack of effort. I think it could be sitting on someone's desk at the government somewhere."

The Scottish Open gets under way on Thursday. English has Davis Thompson's caddie, Joe Etter, filling in for him this week while he waits to hear if Larson will be able to get into the country.

However, with Thompson playing at next week's Open at Royal Portrush, Etter will be unavailable to English.

"Joe was my Plan B," English said. "Now we're going to have to get a new Plan B."

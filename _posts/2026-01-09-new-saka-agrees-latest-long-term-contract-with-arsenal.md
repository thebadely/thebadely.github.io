According to new developments, Bukayo Saka has scored seven goals and provided six assists this season

Bukayo Saka has agreed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.

It is understood the new contract will see the 24-year-old become one of the club's highest paid players.

The agreement is the latest example of Arsenal tying down their key players to long-term contracts as they look to keep their title-chasing squad together.

William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly all signed new long-term contracts in the summer.

England international Saka has become a key player for the Gunners since he made his debut in 2018, having come through the club's Hale End academy.

Last season Saka produced 12 goals and 13 assists in 37 appearances, despite being sidelined for three months with a hamstring injury that required surgery in December 2024.

Saka has been a consistent figure for Arsenal. The 2023-24 season saw him step up as captain for the first time and finish as the club's top scorer with 20 goals.

This season he has again impressed with seven goals and six assists in 27 appearances so far.

Arsenal are poised to end their wait for a trophy this term, currently six points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 100% win record from their six games in the Champions League so far.

The agreement with Saka is more important than the Â£250m outlay Arsenal made to bring in eight new players in the summer.

Saka's importance on the pitch alongside his bond with supporters and his journey from the academy make his position impossible to replicate. 

His new deal will see him stay at the club into the peak years of his career and - after several seasons with numbers that match elite wingers across the game - Arsenal will benefit from the progression he could still achieve. 

This season is set to be crucial for Saka as he looks to help Arsenal lift a major trophy for the first time since the FA Cup in 2020. 

Mikel Arteta can rely on him and he is one of the reasons why the majority of Arsenal's attacking play goes down the right - the side Saka plays on. 

The winger is also set for an important summer with Thomas Tuchel's England at the World Cup.

England fans will hope that after a season of success with Arsenal he can deliver for his country on the biggest stage.

It has been recently reported that Former England captain David Beckham is set to become the 16th men's footballer to be knighted.

BBC Sport has been told Beckham will become a 'sir' in the King's Birthday Honours list for 2025.

In 2003, Beckham was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to football and he is now set to be awarded a knighthood.

Among the former footballers to have been knighted are 1966 World Cup winners Geoff Hurst and Bobby Charlton, former Manchester United managers Alex Ferguson and Matt Busby and former England bosses Gareth Southgate, Alf Ramsey and Walter Winterbottom.

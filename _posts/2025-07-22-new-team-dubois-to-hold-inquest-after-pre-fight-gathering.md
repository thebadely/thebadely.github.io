It has been recently reported that Daniel Dubois - who lost for the third time in 25 fights - with trainer Don Charles

Daniel Dubois' team will hold an "internal inquest" after a video surfaced showing a reported "gathering" at his house just hours before his defeat by Oleksandr Usyk on Saturday.

Dubois, 27, did not arrive at Wembley Stadium until around 20:15 BST - less than two hours before his ring walk.

He was stopped in the fifth round, losing his IBF title as Ukraine's Usyk, 38, became a two-time undisputed heavyweight world champion.

The Londoner's trainer, Don Charles, said he could not confirm the accuracy of the video but admitted that it had taken place, with what he believed to be more than 30 people in attendance.

"I would like to change the word from party to gathering," Charles told BBC Sport.

He added an internal review into the events of fight night is expected, with promoter Frank Warren and his son George set to hold talks with Dubois' team.

"There's a meeting pending," Charles said. "We'll hold an internal inquest on what happened. Questions will be asked by Frank and George Warren."

Charles explained that a similar event had been held before Dubois' shock victory over Anthony Joshua in September, when he knocked out the former champion in the ninth round.

"It's not unusual," he said. "This gathering is the same gathering which was used for the AJ fight day preparation. 

"A lot was made of Daniel's ring walk for that fight - how enthusiastic and confident he looked - and people were praising him."

There are unconfirmed reports the gathering was organised by Dubois' father, and suggestions the fighter left during the event to go for a short drive. Charles rejected claims this was a sign of distress.

"To put logic to it, the father mainly replicated the recipe that worked against AJ to hopefully get a victory last Saturday. And it didn't work. Consequently, there is now a big highlight on this party, which was a gathering," he said.

"Daniel went for a drive, like you do. He's a fighter who's fighting on that day. If he wanted to get some fresh air or whatever, it's not unusual to say 'I'm going for a drive.'"

It is also alleged that some members of Dubois' entourage were refused entry to the venue, contributing to the late arrival. Charles said he was unaware of that situation but was content with how Dubois presented himself on arrival.

"I had 90 minutes to prepare him - the duration of a football game - and I was satisfied," he said. "I didn't see a fighter unsettled. He seemed the Daniel Dubois that I knew, who I see every day in the gym."

Usyk - who also stopped Dubois in the ninth round of their 2023 bout - floored the Londoner twice in the fifth round of the rematch, with Dubois unable to beat the count after the second knockdown.

Dubois has previously faced criticism for "quitting" in defeats to Joe Joyce and Usyk, but Charles insisted his fighter showed bravery.

"He went out on his sword," he said. "He took a punch - a horrible punch - and made the count. The referee waved it off. I'd already thrown the towel in anyway. I didn't want any more for him. I want him to live to fight another day. That's what I'm paid for."

Despite the defeat, Charles praised Usyk as "an all-time great" and said Dubois remains determined to bounce back.

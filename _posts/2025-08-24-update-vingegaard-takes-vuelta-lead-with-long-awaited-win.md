Here’s what you need to know: Jonas Vingegaard claimed a stage while winning the Volta ao Algarve in February but that is a 2.Pro event

Jonas Vingegaard claimed his first World Tour win in more than a year as he edged out Giulio Ciccone to take stage two of the Vuelta a Espana.

The two-time Tour de France champion had not secured a top-tier win since stage 11 of last year's Tour.

But on a cool, rainy 10km climb to the finish, the VismaâLease a Bike rider beat Italian climber Ciccone in a late sprint for the line in Limone, Italy.

That also saw race favourite Vingegaard claim the red jersey from overnight leader Jasper Philipsen, with the Belgian sprinter having struggled in the finale.

Britain's Tom Pidcock followed Felix Gall's attack as the misty summit finish approached, but Ciccone and Vingegaard swept past them inside the final 100m, with the Dane winning by a wheel rim as they lunged for the line.

Sunday's stage was the second of four starting in Italy before the Vuelta heads into Spain and although it is early for Vingegaard to go into the lead, he said: "You're not going to let a stage win pass so when I saw the opportunity, of course I'll take it.

"It's been a while since my last victory so I'm super happy with how I felt, how the team did, and also to have the red jersey."

Vingegaard added: "I went on [Ciccone's] wheel and, to be honest, before the [final] corner I didn't think that it would be possible to pass him, but from the corner on it was longer to the finish than I thought so then I could pass him."  

A 157km flat stage from Alba culminated with a climb of almost 10km with an average gradient of more than 5%.

Rain fell on a cool day of 20C, and Pidcock and Vingegaard were among a group of riders that slipped to the tarmac on a roundabout near the bottom of that last ascent.

"I went down pretty hard, but it seems like I didn't hurt myself too bad," said Vingegaard.

"I have a bit of bruising, but I think because it was so slippery I was sliding more, so I didn't get any bad road rash or anything."

Pidcock added: "I've got be happy with how I rode. I think I always need a few days to get into a race. We committed, I didn't have the legs, but we'll try again another time."

On Monday the riders are set for a grinding all-day ascent on a short but winding 138.5km run to Ceres in the midst of the Graian Alps.

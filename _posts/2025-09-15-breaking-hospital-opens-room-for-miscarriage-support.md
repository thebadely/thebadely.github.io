According to new developments, A room has been opened at a hospital to offer women experiencing miscarriage a calm and private space. 

Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust ward sister Kelly Colledge said the room "acknowledges the significance of early losses".

It included a private outdoor space and a dedicated shower room. 

The project was funded by the Spencer Ward team, the hospital's gynaecology department, which raised Â£7,000, and through donations to Northamptonshire Health Charity.

Matron Jay Briah said: "Before this project, we had no specific space to support people going through early pregnancy loss. 

"The room we used was functional, but it felt dark and clinical, not the kind of environment anyone should have to be in at such a distressing time."

Early pregnancy loss affects about one in four pregnancies, according to the hospital, and the ward team wanted to create a dedicated space to support patients going through this.

The aim of the Dandelion Room was to help "people cope with the trauma, pain, and isolation by providing compassionate care during a profoundly difficult time," said Ms Colledge.

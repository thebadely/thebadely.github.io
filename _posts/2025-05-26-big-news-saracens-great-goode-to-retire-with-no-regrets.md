It has been recently reported that Alex Goode initially joined Saracens' academy in 2006, before making his debut two years later

Saracens full-back Alex Goode said he will retire at the end of this season with "no regrets" after 17 years as a professional at the Premiership club.

The 37-year-old â who has won six league titles and is the club's record appearance maker â reached the milestone of 400 games for Sarries earlier this month.

He helped the team win European Champions Cups in 2016, 2017 and 2019, scoring a try in the second of those finals.

Goode has also played 21 times for England, having been part of Stuart Lancaster's World Cup squad in 2015.

"Nothing prepares you for this moment, it's overwhelming," he told the club website., external

"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd have the privilege of playing for my country and representing this club over 400 times.

"To do something you love and call it a job is unique, and I feel so lucky for that experience."

Goode's other achievements include being named European Player of the Year in 2019.

"To the coaches and all the backroom staff, you are the core of the club, you have supported me always and I can't thank you enough for your time and energy," he said.

"To my team-mates, past and present, it's been an unreal ride, and I'll carry those memories and bonds with me for the rest of my life.

"To the fans, you've stood by us through glory and heartbreak with unwavering faith. To hear your roar on my 400th game, seeing those faces, means more than you'll ever know.

"I leave the field with no regrets, only gratitude. Saracens will always be in my blood."

Director of rugby Mark McCall added: "There are few words left to truly capture the impact someone like Alex Goode has had not just at Saracens, but on the game of rugby as a whole.

"He will undoubtedly go down as one of the most successful players of the professional era.

"Goodey will always be remembered as a great team man, someone who went out of his way to help and support his team-mates. Our younger players have benefited enormously from his wisdom and guidance."

Saracens, who are sixth in the Premiership table, face Bath at home on Saturday in their final game of the league season.

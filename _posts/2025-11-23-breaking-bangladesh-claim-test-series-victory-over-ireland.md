Scorecard

Bangladesh eventually overcame a spirited Ireland on the final day of the second Test to claim a 2-0 series win in Mirpur.

They won the second Test by 217 runs, having claimed victory in the first Test by an innings and 47 runs.

Heinrich Mallan's Ireland side knew they were up against it on Sunday, as they needed 333 more runs on day five to spring an almighty surprise.

While they fell short of their 509 target, Curtis Campher impressed as he dug in for 71 not out from 259 balls.

He was partnered by Test debutant Gavin Hoey, who enjoyed a 104-ball stay that brought 37 runs, including four fours, as he and Campher pushed on into the middle session of the day.

Shortly after lunch, Ireland's total had become the highest fourth-innings Test score in Dhaka by a visiting side.

Bangladesh eventually wrapped up victory and the series in the 60th over of the day as Hoey and then Matthew Humphreys were dismissed by Hasan Murad.

Ireland ended all out for 291 as Murad finished with 4-44.

"At the start of the day the main word we had was fight," said Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie.

"We knew we would be up against it for most of the day but the application by Curtis and Gavin was really amazing and even Jordan [Neill], the way he played, but particularly Curtis to be out there for as long as he was.

"A lot of resilience but at the same time, we were definitely outplayed, and Bangladesh were deserving of their win."

The second Test will be followed by three T20 internationals, the first of which takes place on Thursday, 27 November.

Here’s what you need to know: Manchester City stepped into a new era at the revamped Fifa Club World Cup - but it was one of their old boys who stole the show in Philadelphia.

Academy star Phil Foden struggled for form and fitness last season, but a second-minute goal and assist for Jeremy Doku helped his side to a 2-0 win over Moroccan club Wydad AC in their Group G opener.

With the sun shining at Lincoln Financial Field, the early signs suggest the England international may be on the path back towards his best after scoring only seven times in the Premier League last season.

With his starring role on Wednesday, Foden could also prove integral to City's hopes of success in the competition.

"A new season, fresh me," he told Channel 5 afterwards. "Looking forward to the season now.

"[The tournament is] very important, not just for me, but all the players. It is important to get your sharpness now in this big competition.

"Playing for a club like City, there are expectations to perform in every game. I've been used to that pressure. Last season was a bit rough for all of us, but it is about going again this season."

Boss Pep Guardiola, whose side had Rico Lewis sent off in the 88th minute, said Foden's performance was "really good" after describing his position on the pitch as a holding midfielder.

Man City start new era - but how might Guardiola's side look?

At the end of last season, which City finished without a major trophy for the first time in eight years, Foden revealed he had been carrying an ankle injury and struggling mentality.

He also felt it may be better for him to miss out on the competition in the United States in order to fully recover.

But the 25-year-old, who was the 2024 Premier League Player of the Season and the PFA Players' Player of the Year, will no doubt be now pleased not to have skipped the event.

He was fleet-footed on the ball, occupying pockets of spaces outside the box and looking to dictate the tempo as a lot of City's play against the north African side went through Foden.

His opener - the competition's fastest goal so far - had the hallmarks of a player who had regained his confidence, taking a touch and caressing a fine finish into the far corner.

"Happy with the performance and happy with the three points," added Foden. "I stayed alive, and the ball fell to me. I put it away nicely, so I am happy."

While Foden naturally drifted towards his favoured left side, the England international popped up here, there and everywhere on Wednesday

Foden looks refreshed and rejuvenated, finding freedom in 'Philly' and stepping up in the first game of the post-Kevin de Bruyne era.

Questions will be asked about how City replace the legendary Belgian midfielder, who has signed for Napoli on a free transfer, but Guardiola may have the perfect answer in Foden.

In total, he had 54 touches of the ball against Wydad Casablanca before being substituted on the hour mark for Rodri - and became the first Englishman to score in multiple editions of the Club World Cup.

Guardiola set out his stall for this competition by signing three players for more than Â£100m - and two of those, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, started on their debuts.

Dutchman Reijnders described himself as "box-to-box" number eight when speaking in Florida before the game and there were early positive signs too of what he will bring to this City side.

City struggled without the presence of Rodri in the middle of the park after the Spaniard's serious knee injury last September, but may have found the perfect partner for the Ballon d'Or winner.

Reijnders' athleticism and reading of the game was evident, showing his ability to get around the pitch to snuff out attacks, while also being able to pick out a pass and drive the side forward. He looks to have brought much-needed energy to a City midfield that was often stagnant last term.

"You feel and smell it, a really good player," admitted Guardiola. "The pace and in the final third with the ball, when he gets the rhythm he will be top."

French forward Cherki also showed his creativity with some neat flashes on the ball, but the 21-year-old may be a player that brings eye-catching moments in games rather than controlling the play like Reijnders.

Guardiola, who left another new signing, full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri, on the bench, added: "Kevin is difficult to replace, we know that. At the same time the club decided for Rayan because he has incredible skills close to the box. It was just his first game in tough conditions."

Let's dive into the details: Steve Clarke has led his side to the World and Melissa Andreatta hopes to do likewise

International friendly: Scotland v Ukraine

Venue: Estadio Municipal de Chapin, Jerez Date: Friday, 28 November Kick-off: 11:00 GMT

Coverage: Watch on BBC Sport Scotland website, app & iPlayer

Scotland qualifying for their first men's World Cup in 28 years has "inspired" the women to do the same for the 2027 finals, says head coach Melissa Andreatta.

Steve Clarke's men will be at next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico after they dramatically defeated Denmark last week at Hampden.

The women kick-off their qualifying campaign in March for the event in Brazil 12 months later and are currently in Spain for two final friendlies - against Ukraine on Friday and China next Tuesday - before attention turns to their qualifying group with Belgium, Israel and Luxembourg.

The women's national team are looking to end their own major tournament drought after missing the last three since their appearance at the 2019 World Cup.

Andreatta was at the national stadium to experience "one of the best football experiences of my life" last week and the Australian admits her side are "running off the high of that experience".

"They don't actually need any extra motivation, they're very motivated, but they're inspired for sure, seeing their male counterparts doing what they've done," she told BBC Scotland.

The big questions now Scotland are going to the World Cup

"When that first goal went in, just like everyone else, I was just grabbing onto everyone, screaming because it was like Scott McTominay was floating in the air when he struck that first goal.

"What a way to start and then to go on and win 4-2 with the goals that we scored and the manner in which it all played out, it was fantastic.

"We're one nation, we're Scotland, two teams. What a way it would be to go and do this - the first time that both teams are in their respective World Cups if we get the business done.

"The players have talked about it a lot, wanting to be on the world stage, returning to major tournaments. The men have done that now and the women want to do that too. 

"I think what not only drives them is their individual aspirations, but making the nation proud, making their family and friends proud and that jersey that means so much to so many people. 

"Wearing that with pride and doing that on the world stage. It's true, no Scotland, no party."

Andreatta picked up her first win as head coach in last month's friendly win over Morocco following an entertaining 4-3 defeat by Euro quarter-finalists Switzerland. 

She admitted she was "super pleased" with the performance against the in-form Swiss and is keen to keep progressing.

"With these two internationals, it's again being exposed to two different teams," she explained. 

"We've seen similarities between Ukraine and Luxembourg and Belgium and China. I think using this experience to prepare for those windows next year will be good for us, but also just having time together. 

"This is still only my third window and just having this time together in one location is super important for both players and staff."

Experts revealed that Paddy Pimblett is on a seven-fight win streak in the UFC

Arman Tsarukyan says he was overlooked for an interim lightweight title shot because the UFC "wants to make" Paddy Pimblett champion.

Liverpool's Pimblett will face American Justin Gaethje for the interim belt on 24 January, with number one contender Tsarukyan snubbed.

The match-up was a surprise, considering Gaethje is ranked fourth with Pimblett at number five.

Tsarukyan suggested Pimblett's star power secured him the fight.

"They know if they're going to put me against him, he's going to lose and the star is going to be gone," said Tsarukyan after he returned to action in a wrestling match over the weekend.

"Gaethje is easy money for him. He's old, he has maybe one or two fights left.

"So that's why they give him the interim title shot because he's not going to be a real champion, because there's Ilia Topuria, and I never think he can beat Ilia Topuria."

UFC president Dana White has been coy about why he overlooked Tsarukyan for the interim title fight, but did admit the 29-year-old headbutting Dan Hooker at a weigh-in before his last win contributed to the decision.

Tsarukyan also pulled out of a title fight with Islam Makhachev in January 2025 in fight week.

Lightweight champion Ilia Topuria, 28, is currently taking a break from fighting due to personal reasons surrounding his family.

The UFC decided to do an interim bout in his absence and fans would expect Tsarukyan to fight the winner of Gaethje v Pimblett if the interim title holder is upgraded to full champion or if Topuria's return was further delayed.

Tsarukyan, however, is pessimistic about 31-year-old Pimblett ever agreeing to fight him.

"I'm a nightmare for him and he knows that if we're going to fight, he's going to lose. He's going to try not to fight me his whole life," he said.

"I hope that Justin Gaethje is going to knock him out."

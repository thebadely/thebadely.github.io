It has been recently reported that Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026.

One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026.

It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. 

But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to "expect and deserve".

GTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time.

Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode.

In its statement, Rockstar said it was "sorry for adding additional time" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience.

It said it was "incredibly excited" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City.

The announcement follows the firing of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October.

The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising.

Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment.

Rockstar has stayed tight-lipped about GTA 6, releasing only two trailers so far, with the second arriving in May this year.

With over 100 million views, the nearly three-minute video gave players more insight into the backstory of protagonists Jason and Lucia - a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida - as well as revealing new characters and map locations.

Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism, with its previous big release - Red Dead Redemption 2 - delayed by roughly a year from its original release date.

Increased demand for complexity and scope from players, as well as soaring development costs, has meant publishers are less willing to take risks on unfinished products.

When it finally lands, GTA 6 is likely to be one of the most expensive video games ever made, but also expected to set records with its launch sales.

Whether it will live up to the hype remains to be seen.

Let's dive into the details: Luke Littler said he had endured a "tough" night after making a poor start

Reigning world champion Luke Littler survived a major scare as he progressed to the second round of the World Masters in Milton Keynes.

Despite winning the opening set, the 19-year-old faced defeat as Mike de Decker levelled the contest by hitting a bullseye to complete a 121 checkout. 

The Belgian then took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five set contest and he had a match dart after hitting two treble 20s when attempting a 142 check-out but he missed double 11 with his third arrow.

World number one Littler hit double 16 with his next dart to level the match and then opened with 180 on his way to taking the deciding set.

Littler called it a "tough" night, adding on ITV: "I didn't get going. 

"In the second and third set, Mike deserved to win them.

"I had to fight back and that's what I did. I got over the line, found a bit of form and got the win."

The tournament favourite's win sets up a last-16 showdown with Ross Smith.

Littler was followed on to the stage by defending champion Luke Humphries, who averaged 104 as he defeated Dave Chisnall 3-1.

Humphries, the 2024 world champion, lost the first set but went on to hit seven 180s.

The night's final match saw Stephen Bunting beat Jeffrey de Graaf 3-1.

Day two of the competition also saw wins for Josh Rock, Luke Woodhouse, Danny Noppert and Rob Cross.

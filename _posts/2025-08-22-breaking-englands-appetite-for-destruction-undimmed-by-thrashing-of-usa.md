England 69-7 USA - highlights of impressive win in Sunderland

There is a famous scene in the Netflix documentary Sunderland 'Til I Die in which executive director Charlie Methven is appealing for ideas to improve the atmosphere at the Stadium of Light.

"This is how I'd do it if I was DJ," he tells a group of nonplussed staff as dance music strains at his laptop speakers.

"We want it to be rocking in there, a little bit madâ¦ a bit noisier, a bit more in-your-face."

Turns out he just needed a few more cowboy hats. And thumping victories never do any harm either.

The Red Roses came to town and delivered both. Their 69-7 thrashing of the United States happened in front of a 42,723 crowd â the biggest at any Women's Rugby World Cup match anywhere ever â who revelled in the team's 28th straight victory.

After pop star Anne-Marie, surrounded by pyrotechnics and whirling dancers' limbs, had completed the pre-match show, it took only three minutes for the first chorus of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot to ring around the stands.

For the most part, England's wheels turned as smoothly and slickly as usual.

Ellie Kildunne, the reigning World Player of the Year whose dazzling feet and down-to-earth charm have made her the face of the tournament in England, lived up to that billing.

The full-back made 153 metres and five clean breaks, scored two tries and laid on two for her team-mates in a player-of-the-match performance.

At the final whistle, as the cameras zoomed in on Kildunne, the stadium announcer put on Oasis' She's Electric. An appropriate choice, if you don't forensically examine the lyrics.

'So much more left in England' - Mitchell on Red Roses' opening win

To many first-time viewers of this England team, it was a sight to behold.

None of what occurred will be news to head coach John Mitchell, however. He will be looking more closely at the fine detail of his team, rather than Kildunne's well-known headline-grabbing abilities.

The neat dovetailing of Tatyana Heard and Megan Jones â a centre partnership that combines power, pace and nous â will have been particularly pleasing.

Jones made perhaps the tackle of the match, marching Lotte Sharp at pace and drawing winces from the stands.

Her break, followed by Heard's quick hands, set up Abby Dow's score just after half-time.

It is difficult to see veteran Emily Scarratt, who arrived off the bench in the second half, edging her way back into a first-choice pairing any time soon.

Loose-head Hannah Botterman raged around in the loose and stole a prime turnover off the floor, perhaps inspired by the chance to show up United States' Hope Rogers who was picked in World Rugby's Team of the Year in her position.

Sadia Kabeya buzzed with energy in the back row, while fly-half Zoe Harrison's kicking for posts was superb.

With Emma Sing, the squad's most impressive off the tee, on the bench and the small change potentially crucial in the knockout rounds, it is an area where high standards must be maintained.

The driving maul is still a trump card and the neat off-the-top variation that gave hooker Amy Cokayne her try will have opponents second-guessing themselves afresh.

The scrum was dominant, especially in the early exchanges.

However there is room for improvement.

Some of the intricacies, tip-on passes in midfield particularly, went astray. Better teams will bring more line speed and pressure to bear on those skills.

Jess Breach scored two tries but won't want to watch the way she was shrugged off by Erica Jarrell-Searcy for the United States' score.

Claudia Moloney-MacDonald, who missed this match with a minor injury, will be back to put pressure on Breach soon.

There were some slack kick-off receptions and Mitchell believed his team, who were only seven points up until Maud Muir crossed after 34 minutes in the wake of Alev Kelter's yellow, could have been more clinical in the first half.

"We challenged them around lifting the intensity in the second half and I thought we lifted it well," Mitchell said.

"We want to build pressure and square up a little bit more in our defence.

"All the threats that came at us were the ones we expected. There's a lot we need to do, we only just got started.

"There is so much growth to come. We will get better. The tournament will get harder but we have so much left in us."

It will get harder, but the crowds won't get any bigger unless England make it all the way to the final at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium on 27 September.

Samoa at Northampton's Franklin's Gardens will be followed by Australia at Brighton's Amex Stadium in England's pool campaign, before possible quarter and semi-finals at Bristol's Ashton Gate.

Kildunne paid back some of the love that came her way afterwards.

"The fans definitely made a statement, you made that one really special. Thank you to everybody that came, having rugby in the north is pretty special as well," she said.

"It's a really good start and it is just the start."

That appetite for improvement, to build to new heights, is bad news for England's rivals.

BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Mariona Caldentey

Age: 29 Position: Midfielder Teams: Arsenal and Spain

Mariona Caldentey joined Arsenal last summer and helped deliver the club a second Champions League crown.

She hit the ground running, adding a creative nous and cutting edge to an already strong squad.

Her performances were so impressive following her move from Barcelona that she was named the WSL's player of the year.

She made history for her country, too, as Spain reached the Euro 2025 final, where she netted against England, albeit missing out on the title after her country's defeat in the penalty shootout. 

Caldentey was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or and was also named in Uefa's Champions League and the Professional Football Association's teams of the year.

Caldentey on moving from Barcelona to Arsenal:

"It was sad but exciting at the same time. I just felt it was the moment for me for a new challenge. I had spent a really lovely 10 years in Barca, in football, out on the pitch as well. 

"It felt like it was maybe a bit of a crazy decision because I was in a really good place and really comfy there but I think now it's easy to say it was the right decision. From the first moment I arrived at Arsenal, everybody made it really easy for me so I enjoy it a lot and I'm really happy to be here."

On what has worked so well at Arsenal: 

"I feel so confident playing here. The coaches listen to me, they want the best of me so they just help me in that sense. It's the same with the team-mates: I can make them better and they can make me better. It's a win-win. It's always about the team performance. I think it needed a bit of time in the beginning but I think when I figured it out a bit - my position as well, my team-mates a bit more - it was fantastic."

On her emotions during the Champions League final:

"Playing in the final, it was really hard and weird for me. I'm normally not nervous for playing games. It was a special day but I was a bit nervous as well, of course because it was a final but also because it was against my friends, my ex-team-mates, the staff. Everything I've just left behind and the same year you play against them in a final. It was just meant to be and it was a really special journey during the whole Champions League. We are so happy that Arsenal could win it again after 18 years."

On reaching the Euro 2025 final with Spain:

"It still hurts a bit when I think about the final. We need to remember that we made history because we have never played even in a semi-final. It was a big step in the Euros for us as a team. It's good that we continued making history but of course the main goal was to win. England were better than us so we have to congratulate them. I think we have a really strong national team, we are a brilliant generation and we're just going to keep going."

While three players provided more assists from open play in the Women's Super League last season, Caldentey was arguably the most creative player overall.

She both created the most chances (43) and had the highest expected assists from open play (6.9) in the league, with only her team-mates' finishing preventing her from adding more assists to her name.

The Arsenal midfielder didn't just impress with what she did on the ball though, as she worked tirelessly to win it back too.

Only Tottenham's Ashleigh Neville made more tackles and interceptions than her in the Women's Super League last season and no player won possession back in the final third more often.

Caldentey's positional versatility has led to her playing on both wings, number 10 and in midfield throughout her career. But last season she impressed in a slightly different role, as part of a midfield duo.

Despite starting in central midfield, it was her work moving up the pitch and into wide areas that allowed her to interpret the position in a unique way.

Rigid positional systems can become predictable to defend against but Caldentey often floated towards the left flank.

Her ability to play out wide with ease allowed her team to build-up around opponents' press, finding her wider at times. Chance creation from the flanks was also a hallmark of the teams she played for and by interacting closely with her left winger, she was able to help get the ball into the final third.

Out of possession, Caldentey's ability to win the ball back high up the pitch was unrivalled last season, winning the ball in the opponent's third more than anybody in the WSL. This was while creating the most chances from open play in the league too.

Caldentey's industry and duelling, paired with her technical quality both centrally and out wide, made her one of the most complete footballers in the world last season.

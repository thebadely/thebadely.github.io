Here’s what you need to know: David Beckham played for LA Galaxy before he became co-owner of Inter Miami

David Beckham's star-studded Inter Miami were thrashed 4-1 by Minnesota United but it was the opposition's social media activity that he took exception to - and the former England captain went straight to the comments section.

Saturday's loss was the heaviest Inter had suffered since eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi joined the club in July 2023.

Argentina captain Messi, 37, scored in the second half but Inter suffered a fourth defeat in their past five matches in all competitions.

After their home win, Minnesota posted a photo from the game on Instagram with the caption "Pink Phony Club" - a reference to the colour of Miami's kit and the Chappell Roan song Pink Pony Club.

They also included a snapshot of the league table showing Minnesota moving above Inter.

Beckham, who co-owns the Major League Soccer club, commented on the post, writing: "Show a little respect, be elegant in triumph." 

Minnesota, who are managed by Welshman Eric Ramsay, then posted a picture of a banner from the game that read: "History over hype, culture over cash", with the words "hype and cash" highlighted in pink.

Former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy midfielder Beckham, 50, again commented on the post, writing: "Respect over everything."

Inter won last season's Supporters' Shield for the best regular season record, but lost in the first round of the play-offs.

They hired former Argentina and Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano in November but lost in the semi-finals of the Concacaf Champions Cup and are currently fourth in the MLS Eastern Conference.

Their team includes former Barca stars Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.

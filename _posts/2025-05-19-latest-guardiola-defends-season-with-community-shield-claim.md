It has been recently reported that Manchester City have dropped down to sixth in the Premier League, but have a game in hand

Pep Guardiola has defended Manchester City's trophyless season by saying they are only one of three English teams that could play in the Champions League next term to have claimed silverware.

City edged past rivals Manchester United on penalties in the Community Shield last August but have since endured a miserable campaign, relinquishing their four-year hold on the Premier League trophy and being knocked out early in the Champions League.

On Saturday, their season suffered another low as they were stunned by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

It means for the first time in eight years, City will end a campaign without a major trophy but the Catalan referenced the Community Shield when discussing the only remaining target for them - Champions League qualification.

"Of course, it's important to qualify, but except for Newcastle who won the Carabao Cup, Liverpool won the Premier League and Manchester City that won the Community Shield - the other teams didn't win trophies," Guardiola said.

"So the other teams like Chelsea, who can win one title [Europa Conference League] against Real Betis, and [Manchester] United and Tottenham can win the Europa League.

"All the other teams, they are expecting of course to qualify for the Champions League but this is important for every club that play this in competition next year.

"We played a really good [FA Cup] final, not enough to win it, and we have the last two games, we need four points to be in the Champions League next year and this is enough and everyone has to be aware of that."

With Liverpool Premier League champions and Arsenal sealing second spot, City have a fight to qualify for Europe's elite club competition and a fascinating race has developed for the top five, with third-placed Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in seventh separated by a solitary point.

Results over the weekend means City have dropped to sixth in the table, but they hold a game in hand over the challengers which comes against Bournemouth on Tuesday (kick-off 20:00 BST), with the final round of games taking place on Sunday.

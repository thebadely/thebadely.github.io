According to new developments, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor is "the Andrew formerly known as Prince", according the Sun's headline. Its "editorial says he has lied and obfuscated at every turn", suggesting "there can be no place in public life for him now" and calling for him to "disappear from view for good". The i paper calls Andrew "a stain on his family's reputation" and calls his downfall the most dramatic since Edward VII abdicated in 1936. The Daily Express says "common sense has finally prevailed". 

The Times reports that Sarah Ferguson, Andrew's ex-wife, is "unlikely" to move to Sandringham, bringing an end to 17 years of co-habitation for the former couple. It says she has been "rejected by the good causes she once championed," and that "she too has now become a social pariah". The Daily Mirror's front page simply says "finally" beneath a photo of Andrew. The Daily Mail also has a one-word headline:  "Banished".

The Daily Telegraph says Andrew will be due financial compensation for the early ending of his lease, but notes that the cost of future renovations to Royal Lodge will be deducted from any payout. A royal source has told the paper that the Prince of Wales is "fully supportive" of the King's actions.

Rachel Reeves is still on some front pages. The Telegraph says that the The Telegraph says the chancellor faces a potential bill of more than Â£38,000 after failing to obtain a licence from Southwark Council for renting out her family home. Regulations mean her tenants can claim back a year's rent at an unlicensed property. The Mail reports that Reeves posted messages on social media in support of the local licence in her constituency in Leeds, despite not having obtained one herself in London. The Times says the chancellor was "tripped up by the very red tape she so vigorously applauded".

The Guardian reports analysis from accountancy experts which claims Birmingham City Council was probably never bankrupt, and its decision to issue a section 114 notice two years ago was based on "unaudited and incorrect information". The triggering of the notice triggered deep spending cuts and plans to sell hundreds of millions of pounds of assets.

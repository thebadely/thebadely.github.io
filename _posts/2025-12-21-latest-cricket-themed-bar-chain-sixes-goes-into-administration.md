Experts revealed that Sixes, the cricket-themed social chain backed by England captain Ben Stokes, has gone into administration following a "challenging trading period".

All of the company's 15 UK-based venues remain open, but one branch in Southampton has closed following the decision, with three staff members losing their jobs.

Administrators FRP Advisory said talks were under way with a "number of interested parties" about a sale for the business and its strongest-performing sites, suggesting some other closures could happen.

Tony Wright, joint administrator, said the priority was to "secure the best outcome for the business" while honouring customer bookings "through the Christmas period and beyond".

Sixes, which was launched in 2020, is a chain that combines hospitality with cricket. It hosts parties in which people face bowling machines and try to score as many runs as possible. 

It is part of a similar social entertainment approach offered by rivals including Flight Club and Boom Battle Bar, and is backed in part by 4Cast, an investment group founded by Stokes, current and former England bowlers Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad, and former player turned agent Mike Turns.

Sixes entered administration last week, before England lost the Ashes following defeat in the third test match against Australia in Adelaide.

It is not known how big a share 4Cast, which injected cash back in 2023, has in Sixes. The BBC has contacted 4Cast for comment.

FRP Advisory said while the business had a "core of strongly performing sites, others have struggled", amid "fierce competition for experiential venues and reduced consumer spending due to economic uncertainty".

It said besides the Southampton branch which had closed, its remaining venues and franchises would remain open and all bookings would be honoured through the festive period.

The main job of administration is to try to save a company. 

When businesses are losing money, they may borrow to pay bills, however, if a company cannot pay its debts or borrow any more cash, a team may be brought in to take over from the management and sort out the finances - the process known as administration.

If a business cannot be saved, the company's belongings may be sold so that some of the borrowed money can be repaid, which is known as liquidation.

The hospitality industry has raised concerns in recent times over higher costs facing firms, including business rates and minimum wages, arguing it could lead to jobs losses and businesses folding.

Mr Wright said Sixes had "built a strong brand in the social entertainment space with its unique venues proving very popular with customers".

"While some locations have struggled in an increasingly competitive market, the business has significant potential, and we're encouraged by the early interest we've received from parties interested in acquiring the brand and its strongest-performing sites," he added.

"We're confident that with the right investment and focus, Sixes can build on its core strengths."

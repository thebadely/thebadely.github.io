It has been recently reported that Steve McClaren managed England from 2006 to 2007

It wasn't supposed to end like this.

Steve McClaren left one international job after failing to qualify for a major tournament 18 years ago when England missed out on reaching Euro 2008.

He was not intending to be feeling as desperate as that again.

Yet there he was, in the bowels of the National Stadium in Jamaica, coming to terms with a 0-0 draw with Curacao that on one side is a fairytale for the tiny Caribbean island that now becomes the smallest nation to reach the World Cup, but on the other represents a monumental failure for the 'Reggae Boyz'.

Just as he did in the wake of his England failure, McClaren remained dignified as he confirmed the end of his 18-month tenure as Jamaica coach.

"Over the last 18 months I have given everything I have to this job," he said.  "Leading this team has been one of the greatest honours of my career.

"But football is a results business and tonight we have fallen short of our goal, which was to qualify from this group.

"It is the responsibility of the leader to step forward, take accountability and make decisions in the best interests of the team.

"After deep reflection and an honest assessment of where we are and where we need to go, I have decided to step down as head coach of the Jamaican national team.

"Sometimes the best thing a leader can do is to recognise when a fresh voice, new energy and a different perspective is required to move this team forward."

'It's been an honour'

The words hide a massive blow to McClaren's professional pride.

Leaving Manchester United in the summer of 2024, where he was assistant manager to Erik ten Hag, the attraction of signing the contract with Jamaica was the avenue it opened to the World Cup, given the three current Concacaf heavyweights - USA, Mexico and Canada - all have automatic qualification for next year's tournament as co-hosts.

McClaren vowed he would be "back" after the England torment. On the international stage, this was supposed to be it.

Never had Jamaica had a better chance of emulating the 1998 team of Robbie Earle, Fitzroy Simpson and Frank Sinclair by reaching the World Cup for the second time in their history.

It was not straightforward.

For a start, the failed efforts to bring Mason Greenwood into the group were first delayed by a documentation issue then, after the former Manchester United striker was granted citizenship in August, he declined a call-up the following month, saying he was not ready to commit to Jamaica.

Over the past week McClaren had been sweating on the availability of another UK-born player, Brentford defender Rico Henry, who was only given clearance to make his debut in Thursday's draw with Trinidad and Tobago in the hours before the game.

It had been anticipated that Michail Antonio would also be part of his squad, but the former West Ham striker has not played a competitive game since he featured for Jamaica in their Gold Cup campaign in the summer, which was his comeback from a horrific car accident six months earlier.

Then there is being part of a Confederation where the conditions can change from freezing cold and snow to blistering heat in the space of a flight.

"These 18 months have been hard - really hard," said McClaren. "I have had to learn lessons very quickly.

"The experience of Concacaf football has been unique for me. Caribbean football is different to central American football, which is different to north American football. I have not experienced that before."

In hindsight, the late equaliser Jamaica conceded against Trinidad and Tobago last week proved crucial as it meant Curacao went into the final game needing only a draw.

The heady pre-match optimism of a capacity crowd at Kingston's National Stadium, with songs being sung and vuvuzelas blowing, soon gave way to nervousness as Jamaica failed to take a grip of the game in the first half and instead toiled badly on a night when they managed only one shot on target.

Three times they hit the woodwork in a frantic second period. An injury-time penalty seemed set to save them, only for the video assistant referee to decide otherwise.

Not even a pre-match speech from Usain Bolt, probably Jamaica's most famous sporting son, could inspire them.

Jamaica still have a shot at qualification. But the odds are now against them in a six-team mini-tournament in Mexico where they will have to win two games.. It will end in a final against DR Congo or Iraq.

For McClaren, there is not the same safety net.

Ironically, in the aftermath of losing the England job, he took refuge in the Caribbean when he went on holiday to Barbados.

Now he is leaving the area, having been unable to deliver some respite to a population still coming to terms with the devastation caused by Storm Melissa, unable to generate the Jamaican smiles he spoke so warmly about.

McClaren has enjoyed success as a club manager. His memories on the international stage are only tinged with the deepest of regrets.

According to new developments, Gethin Jones, whose career began at Welsh broadcaster S4C, presents BBC One's Morning Live and The One Show

Television presenter Gethin Jones has been named Team Wales' chef de mission for the Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games.

Jones was the Team Wales attache at the Gold Coast 2018 Games, a role that inspired him to return to university to complete a master's degree in sports directorship.

Commonwealth Games Wales (CGW) said Jones will be the "figurehead" of Team Wales.

CGW said the former Blue Peter presenter's role will include leading and motivating athletes and support staff, as well as representing Wales at official functions and acting as the team's spokesperson in the lead-up to and during the Games. 

"His background in sports and media, combined with his deep connection to Welsh culture, makes him an ideal leader to inspire and guide Team Wales through the upcoming Games as the figurehead spokesperson for the team," they added.

Jones, 47, called his appointment a "tremendous honour", adding: "Since my involvement in 2018, I knew I wanted to be involved with Team Wales again and I knew I needed to develop my skills and knowledge of leadership and governance, and build a deeper understanding of performance at an elite level."

How will a smaller Commonwealth Games affect Team Wales?

CGW chair Gareth Davies said: ''The chef de mission role is integral to shaping the team's culture and values, both internally among athletes and support staff, and externally to the wider public. 

"We are really pleased that Gethin wanted to apply for this position and it's a testament to his commitment and passion for the role how professional and knowledgeable he is."

CGW said Jones gained "valuable experience" working at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics, as well as at other international sporting events, giving him "a broad understanding of elite sport environments and the demands of high-level sports management". 

"His responsibilities will include fostering a positive team culture, building relationships with the athletes, sports and wider Glasgow 2026 organising committee, ensuring effective communication among all stakeholders," they added.

The Glasgow Games take place from 23 July to 2 August 2026.

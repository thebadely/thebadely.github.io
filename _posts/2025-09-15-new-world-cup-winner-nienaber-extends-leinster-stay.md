Experts revealed that Nienaber joined Leinster in 2023 after leading South Africa to back-to-back World Cup triumphs

Leinster senior coach Jacques Nienaber has signed a contract extension to remain at the province until the end of the 2026-27 campaign.

The 52-year-old joined Leinster in 2023 after guiding South Africa to back-to-back World Cup wins.

He joins attack coach Tyler Bleyendaal and scrum specialist Robin McBryde - a former Wales hooker and forwards coach - in signing new deals to remain with the URC champions.

Leinster head coach Leo Cullen told the club's website: "I think we can all appreciate the work that Robin, Jacques and Tyler have done but also the mark that they have left and are leaving on Leinster in their time here.

"They have all brought tonnes of relevant experience and a different perspective to how we do things, and I think that's hugely important for the development of our group, that we hear other voices and other ways of operating.

"It's not just around the senior team as well, you see it with our academy players and the work that they do visiting the clubs and the schools and giving freely of their time. I'm delighted to have them all on board again."

Nienaber's previous contract tied him to Leinster only until 2026.

Leinster also confirmed their former out-half Emmet Farrell has been appointed to a new role of provincial kicking coach but will remain as kicking coach for the senior side.

Brian Colclough has taken over Farrell's former position as lead performance analyst for Cullen's side.

Leinster begin the defence of their URC title away to the Stormers on 26 September.

Ireland Women produced a strong display to beat Zimbabwe Women by six wickets in their opening Twenty20 International at Sydney Parade in Dublin.

Captain Gaby Lewis won the toss and opted to bowl first, with the hosts making a good start as Orla Prendergast claimed a wicket in the third ball of the innings.

Zimbabwe wickets continued to tumble as Cara Murray claimed three of them, Arlene Kelly two and debutant Lara McBride got one to get Llyod Tennant's side off to a flying start.

The tourists ended 117-9 which Ireland managed to chase down by the 17th over having lost just four wickets of their own in a fine batting display.

Lewis made 67, becoming the first woman to pass 4,000 runs across all formats for Ireland in the process.

Further history was made by 19-year-old Amy Hunter, whose nine runs helped her pass 1,000 in T20 internationals for her country. 

Ireland will look to win the three-match series in the second T20 international which takes place on Tuesday.

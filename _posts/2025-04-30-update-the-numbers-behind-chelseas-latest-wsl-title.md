It has been recently reported that Chelsea won the 2023-24 WSL title by goal difference on the final day

Yet another Women's Super League trophy is coming Chelsea's way.

The Blues wrapped up their sixth successive league title with two games to spare when they beat Manchester United on Wednesday night.

It is the first time in five seasons the title race has not been decided on the final day.

But have Chelsea really been that dominant? And how does their latest triumph compare to the previous five? BBC Sport takes a look.

Under Emma Hayes, Chelsea established themselves as the dominant force in England's top division and Sonia Bompastor has continued that legacy.

The club have now won six WSL titles in a row and nine overall - three times as many titles as any other side.

Bompastor has hit the ground running since joining the Blues, with her side going unbeaten in 20 league games this term - a new record for the longest unbeaten streak in a single WSL season.

Excluding the inaugural WSL season in 2011, Bompastor becomes the first manager to win the title in her first season in the competition.

The WSL invincibles? Chelsea eye records after sealing another title

Only once in the past five seasons have Chelsea gone unbeaten in the WSL.  

That was during the 2019-20 campaign when the season was suspended early because of the the coronavirus pandemic.

Chelsea had only played 15 games at that point and they were named WSL winners based on a points-per-game ratio.

If the Blues avoid defeat against Tottenham and Liverpool in their remaining two games they will become the first team to have completed an 'invincible' season twice, having gone 18 games unbeaten in 2017-18.

Manchester City (2016) and Arsenal (2012) are the only other teams to have gone unbeaten in a WSL season, but that was when each team played just 16 games and 14 games respectively.

Two more victories would also see Chelsea reach 60 points and overtake the 58 set by Hayes' Blues in 2022-23 for the highest points total in WSL history.

While 54 goals in 20 games might seem like a decent goals-to-game ratio, Chelsea haven't been as prolific in front of the posts compared to other seasons.

Unless the Blues can score eight more goals in their last two games, it will be their lowest goal tally since the Covid-disrupted season when they scored 47.

Chelsea have become used to blowing teams away, but they've often had to slog out results this time around.

Last term, they won 13 games by a margin of three or more goals. This season, just six of their wins have been by three or more goals.

In fact, Bompastor's side have won eight games by just one goal, while only two of their 18 wins under Hayes last season were decided by a single goal.

And, they've left it late on plenty of occasions. Almost a third of their goals this season have come in the final 15 minutes of matches - compared to 9% in the opening 15 minutes.

Comebacks have also been a specialty, with the Blues winning eight points from losing positions - second only to Manchester City (10 points).

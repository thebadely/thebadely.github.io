It has been recently reported that Sara Cox's final international game was New Zealand's Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final win over South Africa

Sara Cox, the world's first professional female rugby union referee, is to retire from international officiating. 

Cox became centrally contracted by the RFU in 2016 and has officiated at the last five Women's Rugby World Cups. She has been a referee in the last three having been an assistant referee in 2014 and 2010. 

The Exeter official's 51 international matches is the most officiated by a female referee - the last of which was New Zealand's quarter-final win over South Africa at Sandy Park in last year's World Cup. 

"I feel very privileged to have officiated at the highest level of the global game for over a decade," said Cox, who has also taken charge at the Commonwealth Games, Six Nations and Women's WXV. 

"Rugby has given me amazing experiences but after the high of a home World Cup, now feels like the right time to hang up my international boots and spend some time on other interests while continuing to give my all to the club game."

Cox is also a regular official in Premiership Women's Rugby as well as the men's Prem. 

She was awarded an MBE for services to rugby union in the 2023 King's Birthday Honours list.

"I'd like to thank everyone who has supported my career, I wouldn't be where I am without the amazing team around me and a group of fantastic colleagues both in England and when travelling around the world," she added.

"But most of all I'd like to thank my friends and family â particularly my mum who has always been my biggest supporter.  

"Being able to referee a game in Exeter, my home town, during last summer's World Cup was a moment of real pride and amazing to do so in front of people who've championed me in my career but not always been able to travel to the far-flung places I've worked.

"I look forward to continuing to referee in our domestic leagues and hopefully continuing to encourage other women to see match officiating as a role for them."

Cox refereed the rugby sevens at the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games - taking charge of the final at the Covid-19 delayed games in Tokyo after officiating in the first-ever Women's Sevens tournament in Rio de Janeiro five years earlier. 

 "Sara has been a true pioneer for match officials and an inspiration to so many," Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney said.

"Her professionalism, resilience and passion for the game have broken barriers and demonstrated the path to top level match officiating for women across the world. 

"She deserves huge plaudits for everything she's achieved in her international career, and we are delighted that she will be continuing to contribute to the English game."

It has been recently reported that Three people have been injured in an "ongoing serious incident" involving a man seen with weapons in Leeds.

The man was seen in Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at 14:47 BST, West Yorkshire Police said.

A male has been detained and inquires are ongoing to establish exactly what has happened. 

The force said officers "attended and located three people who had suffered injuries which are at this time not being treated as life threatening", adding that "further updates will follow".

A spokesperson added: "A number of police scenes remain in place, ensuring public safety remains our priority."

The incident happened on the Otley Run, which is a popular pub crawl route in Leeds. 

Those participating in the run could be seen in fancy dress outside venues on Otley Road, close to where the incident happened.

Taylor's Sports Bar & Grill, a venue which is part of the pub crawl, announced on social media it would be closed until further notice. 

A statement on its Facebook page said the closure was "due to unforeseen circumstances", before apologising to customers.

Joanna Myers, owner of the Swine Bistro on Otley Road, said: "It was all very shocking, especially with all the Otley runners out. 

"It could have been a lot worse than it was."

Ali Khan, owner of Indian restaurant The Cat's Pyjamas which is on Otley Road, said people were "afraid and concerned" following the incident. 

"We didn't find it safe to go out anywhere unless we knew what was going on," he said.

"I told all my staff members to stay inside and stay safe and vigilant."

Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Leeds West and Pudsey Rachel Reeves said  it was "shocking" and asked anyone with information to contact the police. 

She said: "My thoughts are with all of those affected."

Mayor of West Yorkshire Tracy Brabin added: "I am being fully briefed by West Yorkshire Police as they work with local communities on the ground.

"As a suspect is in custody, I would ask people to refrain from sharing any speculation across social media."

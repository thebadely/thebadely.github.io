It has been recently reported that In a warehouse on an industrial estate a group of volunteers are sorting through items donated to a Dorset baby bank.

One of those helping out is Kelly Fahy, from Weymouth, who said she wanted to give back after her family benefitted from the donations to Family Matters Dorset. 

Found on the Granby, it caters to those that are in need by providing clothes, equipment and toys to babies and children of preschool age.

The Weymouth and Portland Baby Bank is one of 75 collection points for the BBC Radio Solent Soapbox Appeal in Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight across January.

They will then be sent to charities and communities groups who will help distribute them.

Kelly first went to the baby bank nearly five years ago when she needed essentials for her five-month-old daughter.

"It was Covid and the other half was laid off, so we needed the money and we found this place and yeah, incredible," she said.

"So back then it was nappies, baby milk and clothes and there were some toys for her as well.

"Because of course babies need teething rings and things like that which are here, it's all here."

She said she felt like she needed to give back to the charity "and what a better way of doing it by volunteering for them".

Speaking about donating items to the BBC Radio Solent Soapbox Appeal, Kelly also urged people to bring in baby wipes and nappies.

She said: "We have all hit hard times and it takes the community to rally round and help."

Donations can include new and unopened toiletries, like shampoo and toothpaste, as well as other cleaning products including washing up liquid, sponges, cloths and tissues.

Last year's appeal saw thousands of the items donated and distributed.

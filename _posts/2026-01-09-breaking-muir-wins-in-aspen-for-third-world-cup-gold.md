Here’s what you need to know: Kirsty Muir's first career World Cup win came last season in the Slopestyle event in Tignes, France, in March 2025

Great Britain's Kirsty Muir claimed a third World Cup victory of her career by winning the Freeski Slopestyle event at the US Grand Prix in Aspen on Friday.

The 21-year-old finished first in qualifying before winning gold with a score of 80.62 achieved on her first run of the final in Colorado a little over a month after breaking her thumb.

It is the Scot's seventh career World Cup podium finish and her second victory of the 2025-26 season, after she took gold at the Big Air World Cup at the Secret Garden in Zhangjiakou, China, in November.

"I'm just very stoked, stoked with how I'm skiing," said Muir.

"Conditions were slightly tough today, so we just managed to get through it. I'm just really enjoying myself, enjoying how I'm skiing at the moment, so everything's really good."

Canadians Megan Oldham and Elena Gaskell finished second and third in the final with scores of 73.02 and 72.90 respectively. 

Muir's winning run featured a right-side double cork 1080, a left-side 720, and a front-side 630 out.

"Kirsty has faced her fair share of adversity this winter," said GB Snowsport's Freeski head coach Jamie Matthew.

"From winning her first Big Air to then breaking her thumb the week after, today's win shows her strength of character to continually show up and give it her best. 

"I couldn't be happier for her, wins are always hard fought, so it's amazing she's walked away with something to show for the continued hard work and dedication."

Muir, who was Team GB's youngest competitor at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 aged 17, will compete at the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics next month.

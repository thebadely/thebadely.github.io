According to new developments, Luke Littler is the reigning world champion

World champion Luke Littler says he was left "shaking with nerves" when he was "followed" on the motorway by a photographer two days after passing his driving test.

The 18-year-old posted a picture on social media, external on Monday after passing his test first time with no minors.

"On Wednesday, I was driving up to [girlfriend] Faith's and I was getting followed," said Littler, who became the youngest PDC World Championship winner when he claimed the title aged 17 in January.

"I made, like, the latest exit that you could possibly do on a motorway.

"I came off so late and then so did he. And I think I did about three U-turns, he did the same, but I was just shaking with nerves."

After the incident Littler, second in the world rankings, said he decided to post a photo of his car online "so he [photographer] couldn't sell his pictures".

"I know it's the job, but following me on the motorway - it's dead busy. I was nervous and stuff. But, yeah, that's why I posted the car, so he couldn't do it."

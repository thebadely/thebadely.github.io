It has been recently reported that Shoaib Bashir took nine wickets in England's defeat of Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge

England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir is open to leaving Somerset when his contract expires at the end of the season in order to play more county cricket.

The 21-year-old is first-choice spinner for Ben Stokes' Test team but behind left-armer Jack Leach in the pecking order at Taunton.

Bashir had three County Championship matches on loan at Glamorgan earlier this season and one match for Worcestershire in 2024.

As reported by ESPNCricinfo,, external Bashir is now free to speak to other counties as, from 1 June each year, players with expiring contracts are permitted to negotiate with other clubs.

Bashir played age-group cricket for Surrey, but the defending county champions are not thought to be in the running for his signature.

Bashir signed a two-year deal with Somerset in 2023, and was then picked for England's tour of India the following year after playing only six first-class matches.

Despite a modest domestic record â Bashir's average in the County Championship is 84 â he has thrived for his country under Stokes' leadership.

He was man of the match in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe last month with career-best match figures of 9-143, which also included Bashir becoming the youngest England man to reach 50 Test wickets.

While he has replaced Leach as England's number one spinner, Somerset have kept faith with the 33-year-old as their first choice.

Bashir's route to Somerset's first XI is further complicated by the emergence of 19-year-old Archie Vaughan, who provides an all-round option with his off-breaks.

Any potential move for Bashir would hinge on the opportunity to play more and accelerate his development.

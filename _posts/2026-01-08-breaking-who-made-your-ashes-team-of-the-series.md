According to new developments, BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the series for the Ashes.

We asked you to pick an 11 that included two openers, four middle-order batters or all-rounders, a wicketkeeper and four bowlers.

Voting was completed during the fifth Test in Sydney.

Here's who made the cut and their series stats.

Innings: 10, runs: 629, average: 62.90, centuries: three

No doubts about this man's selection. Travis Head stepped up to open in the first Test and has dominated from the top of the order. He blazed 123 in Perth, sealed the series victory with 170 in Adelaide and then added 163 in Sydney for good measure.

Innings: 10, runs: 273, average: 27.30, centuries: none

Bar Head, the other openers in the series have enjoyed modest returns. Zak Crawley was dismissed for a pair in Perth, but made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide.

Innings: eight, runs: 286, average: 57.20, centuries: one

So frequently a feature of English nightmares, Steve Smith had a relatively quiet series initially, passing fifty once and missing the Adelaide Test with sickness. However, his 138 in Sydney took the game away from England and saw him become the second-highest Ashes run-scorer behind Don Bradman.

Innings: 10, runs: 400, average: 44.44, centuries: two

Feast and famine for England's legendary batter. Joe Root finally got to three figures in Australia, making an unbeaten 138 in Brisbane and 160 in Sydney, but only passed 20 on one other occasion in the series.

Innings: 10, runs: 438, average: 39.77, centuries: none

A case of what could have been for Harry Brook. The big-hitting batter passed 40 on five occasions in the series, but his highest score was his 84 in Sydney.

Innings: 10, runs: 184, average: 18.40, wickets: 15, average: 25.13

A better series with the ball than with the bat for England's skipper. Ben Stokes was frequently England's most threatening bowler, with his best showing a 5-23 in Perth. He made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide but his next highest score was 19, and he was dismissed for single figures on six occasions.

Innings: eight, runs: 323, average: 46.14, dismissals: 28

The default pick for the wicketkeeper position. Alex Carey prospered both behind the stumps and with the bat. After 63 in Brisbane, he had a dream Test at his home ground of Adelaide, hitting 106 and 72 as Australia clinched the series.

Matches: five, wickets: 31, average: 19.93, strike-rate: 29.6; runs: 156

A remarkable series for the left-armer. Mitchell Starc started the series with a bang, taking 10 wickets in Perth as Australia blew England away inside two days. He added 6-75 in the first innings at Brisbane while also contributing crucial half-centuries in both the second and third Tests.

Matches: three, wickets: nine, average: 27.11, strike-rate: 53.33, runs: 102

England wanted express pace in Australia and Jofra Archer delivered. While his figures didn't necessarily reflect his contribution in the first two Tests, he took 5-53 in the first innings in Adelaide and added a half-century later in the Test. A side strain saw him withdraw from the series after that match.

Matches: five, wickets: 20, average: 24.95, strike-rate: 47.9

Scott Boland's nagging accuracy tormented England throughout the series. Thanks to the absence of Josh Hazlewood, the veteran seamer delivered in spades. He even got to open the batting in the quick-paced Test at Melbourne.

Matches: three, wickets: 18, average: 20.11, strike-rate: 32.4

What if he'd played earlier? Josh Tongue was introduced in the third Test in Adelaide and set about adding to his already impressive haul of international wickets. He took 4-70 in the second innings in South Australia and picked up 5-45 as England bowled out Australia for 152 on day one in Melbourne.

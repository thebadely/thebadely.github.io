Experts revealed that McClean won 103 caps for Republic of Ireland

Former Republic of Ireland international James McClean has returned to Derry City on a multi-year-deal after leaving Wrexham.

The 36-year-old previously played for the Candystripes from 2008-2011, winning a League of Ireland First Division title with the club in 2010.

McClean then moved to Premier League side Sunderland and has also had spells in the top flight with West Brom and Stoke City as well as two stints at Wigan Athletic, where he won the FA Cup in 2013 and the League One title in 2022.

The versatile midfielder joined Wrexham while the club were in League Two in 2023 and has since helped them to successive promotions to get them into the Championship.

He was named Wrexham captain in 2024 and made 108 appearances for the club, including 19 in all competitions this season.

McClean, who won 103 Republic of Ireland caps, joins his brother Patrick McClean at the Brandywell after he arrived from Sligo Rovers on Thursday.

He is keen to hit the ground running on his return and help the club to a first Premier Division title since 1997. 

"It's 15 years since I was last a Derry City player and it's a bit bittersweet because it brings to an end 15 years in England, but to be home I'm absolutely delighted and can't wait to get going," he told BBC Sport NI.

"I started my career at Derry and I made no mistake that is where I wanted to finish my career, home is where the heart.

"I'm as fit as I've ever been, I have the same desire and hunger and I still feel like I've a lot to give. When I was leaving Wrexham the only place I was going was home.

"For a club of this stature, going almost 30 years without a league title is unacceptable so I've got a challenge and I love a challenge."

McClean was a key player in Derry City's promotion-winning campaign in 2010

It's back to where it all began for McClean, 14 years after he departed his hometown club for pastures new at Sunderland, he's back at Brandywell hoping to guide the club to their first league title in 28 years.

Even at 36, the sight of McClean is sure to send fear into the League of Ireland full-backs, and his signing is a real statement of intent from the Candystripes ahead of the new season.

McClean was one of the first four players signed by the club when they were rebuilding on their way to winning the First Division title in 2010.

The flying young winger scored eight goals in 33 games as the club returned to the top-flight.

The Derry native made the big move to the Premier League and Sunderland in 2011, but had to wait until 2012 for his big breakthrough and it was another Derry man in Martin O'Neill who handed him his debut in a surprise 1-0 win over Manchester City.

McClean never looked back and his performances earned him a spot in the Republic of Ireland squad for the 2012 European Championships.

He racked up 103 caps for the Republic, including an appearance at Euro 2016, scoring 16 goals before retiring from international duty in November 2023.

The path back to Brandywell has come via Wigan, West Brom, Stoke and lastly Wrexham, the Hollywood club under the stewardship of Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds.

Derry fans will hope he brings some of that glitz and glamour home with him, to secure a career ending fit for the big screen.

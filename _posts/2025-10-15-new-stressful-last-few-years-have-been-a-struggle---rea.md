It has been recently reported that Jonathan Rea won all his six world titles as a Kawasaki rider before joining Yamaha

Jonathan Rea says he is "at peace" that his decision to retire from World Superbike racing at the end of the season is "100% the correct one" after the stresses and struggles of the past few years made competing in the sport less enjoyable.

The six-time series champion has had time to reflect since announcing in August his decision to bring the curtain down on his distinguished career and is now preparing for his final race weekend in the championship at Jerez in Spain this weekend, 17 years after he made his bow.

Rea is the most successful rider in World Superbikes, collecting those titles as a Kawasaki rider in consecutive years between 2015 and 2020, securing 119 race wins and 264 podiums.

He was unable to add to those successes during a difficult past couple of years as part of the Pata Yamaha set-up.

"At the time it was a really hard decision to come to and there were many emotions involved," said Rea in an interview with BBC Sport NI's Stephen Watson.

"The last few races the weight has been taken off my shoulders. I've always had that nervous excitement throughout my career, but it turned more into stress and I wasn't enjoying that side of it.

"These past 18 months have been marred with injuries and setbacks and tough times. Issues like that are always worth it when you're winning but it's been a struggle these past couple of years.

"From a performance point of view I don't feel that I am where I should be - not reaching my potential, but also the bike. It just got to a point where I felt it wasn't worth it."

Watch: Rea looking to the future ahead of World Superbike retirement

The Northern Ireland rider explains that he is looking forward to "life at a quieter pace" but wants to "finish in a good way" in Spain.

"I want to finish this chapter safe and sound and enjoy the fruits of our labour. It's been a massive career.

"While I was continuing to look ahead to the next race I did always manage to enjoy the moment. You're in this bubble of always wanting more and I think since the announcement and being at peace with that it's easier to look back at what we did achieve and feel incredibly proud.

"I've got a great life away from the circuit - with my wife, the kids, family, and these last four or five years being back home in Northern Ireland."

The 38-year-old added that he was humbled by the reaction to his decision as he was inundated with messages from across motorcycle sport and beyond.

"I didn't really expect the flood of messages from everywhere. Messages from the fans and from your peer group, rivals you raced against every weekend, MotoGP riders.

"It's really nice. I never felt I would get that kind of reaction. It was amazing and I felt extremely proud.

"And while we say it's the last race, is it ever the last race? I don't know what's next.

"For sure I've got ambitions to still get behind the start line, whether it be in motocross, maybe doing things a little bit differently in the future."

Rea says he is weighing up his options for the future and considering a number of possible options.

"I'm not sure exactly what's next. I've been blessed to have opportunities to keep riding. I had a manufacturer ask me into a meeting room to try and tempt me out of retirement.

"There are a few projects. I've been considering doing some World Endurance racing, been considering doing some test riding.

"I'm not a guy who can just be at peace sat at home on the sofa. I need something to do - my talent, my life is Superbike, is racing, is motorbikes, and I still have that passion. Whether it's competition or just riding a bike I'm not exactly sure yet, but for sure I'll be riding in some shape or form.

"That might even be off-road - doing some other disciplines of riding or going back to my roots that I enjoyed so much. I've still got a lot of adrenaline to fix."

The County Antrim racer says for him his first world crown was the "most special".

"I think your first world title is always the most special. It's what everybody dreams of, to be a world champion in their discipline. It just kept snowballing and to win six titles in a row just showed how competitive we were as a team, not making mistakes and always working hard to improve.

"Because when you set the benchmark and the level, everyone was improving, but we kept finding ways to improve ourselves as well.

"That was an amazing period in my career and one that I definitely couldn't imagine or dream of as a kid. It put me in a room of names with guys that were heroes and that's incredibly special."

Rea secured eighth and seventh place finishes while deputising for the injured Casey Stoner in the Repsol Honda team in 2012 but says he can have no regrets about not competing in the series as a suitable offer never came his way.

"I can't regret something that was never really a realistic option. Back in the early days when I was with Honda I got offered the chance to ride the open class bike, a 'B' class ride within the MotoGP championship, but that was never on my radar.

"When you're competing at world championship level you want at least the competitive tools to fight with the best guys in the world.

"I've always been very fortunate to be mentioned about going to MotoGP or having talks with MotoGP. My management has always pushed hard and had the right conversations but I've never had a contract in front of me to go there.

"So I can't really regret it but I did get that opportunity in 2012 with the most iconic team and bike in GP history. I feel like I ticked the box at least, got good points, raced against one of the greatest of all time, Valentino Rossi. I had that experience and really enjoyed it."

Away from the track, Rea received recognition for his achievements in the form of finishing second in the 2017 Sports Personality of the Year award, receiving around 3,000 fewer public votes than the winner, renowned athlete Sir Mo Farah.

"It [SPOTY] was incredible. When I was second it was amazing, at an awards ceremony that people have to vote for. 

"I got a huge vote which we can be proud of, for Northern Ireland, but also for the motorcycle world to share the spotlight with mainstream sport, was really nice and proud to put motorcycling on the map."

Rea expects his final weekend in World Superbike to be a special one.

"I imagine it's going to be a weekend full of emotion. It'll be nice to have all my family there.

"I'm retiring but the last round of the series everyone wants to finish well because it's the one that you remember throughout the off-season.

"It would be so nice to stand on the podium again. That would be a massive target to finish the year off. If we could achieve that, it would be the icing on the cake."

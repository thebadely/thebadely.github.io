Let's dive into the details: Jared Waerea-Hargreaves helped Hull KR reach a second successive Grand Final in what looks to have been his final game

Hull KR prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is set to miss Saturday's Grand Final against Wigan after being given a three-match ban by the Rugby Football League.

If the punishment is upheld, then it will mean that the 36-year-old has played for the last time in his career.

The former New Zealand international has been charged with a Grade C head contact offence in Saturday's semi-final win over St Helens.

Waerea-Hargreaves joined the Robins on a one-year deal for the 2025 season after 14 years with Sydney Roosters.

He made 18 Super League appearances and helped the club to the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield.

He confirmed in April that this would be his final season before retiring.

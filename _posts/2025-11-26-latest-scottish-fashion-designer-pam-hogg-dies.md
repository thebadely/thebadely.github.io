Here’s what you need to know: Pam Hogg, the Scottish fashion designer who created looks for stars including Rihanna and Kate Moss, has died, her family has announced.

The designer was known for her eccentric and outlandish designs, which have also been worn by stars including Lady Gaga and Kylie Minogue.

In a statement posted on Instagram, her family said they were "deeply saddened" to announce "the passing of our beloved Pamela".

Her family said Hogg had died "peacefully" at a hospice surrounded by "cherished friends and family".

Hogg was understood to be in her 60s, but she told the Guardian in 2018 that she did not publicly disclose her age.

No cause of death was given, but her family said they "wish to thank all the staff of St Joseph's Hospice, Hackney for the beautiful support they provided for Pamela in her final days".

"Pamela's creative spirit and body of work touched the lives of many people of all ages," they added. "She leaves a magnificent legacy that will continue to inspire, bring joy and challenge us to live beyond the confines of convention."

The statement concluded: "Pamela will continue to live in our hearts and minds. A glorious life lived and loved."

Broadcaster Fearne Cotton was among those paying tribute in the comments on Instagram, writing: "Pam. Oh Pam. What a joy it was to know you. I'll miss you Pam."

Menswear designer Mr Kim Jones wrote: "Love you Pam you were so strong right to the end our warrior queen."

TV presenter Andi Oliver and actress Gwendoline Christie were among others leaving comments, while designer Bella Freud added: "How sad to think of the fashion world without her shining brilliance."

Garbage singer Shirley Manson described Hogg as "our revered Scottish fashion queen".

"The brilliance and the bravery and the extraordinary, explosive sense of humour that perpetually burled you forth with tremendous force. 

"The Iconoclastic and fantastic Dr Hogg may have left the runway but you will be found in the long and storied history of British fashion and in the imaginative , pioneering work of each and every fashion designer who trails in your wake."

Hogg, who was born in Paisley, studied Fine Art and Printed Textiles at the Glasgow School of Art.

She went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London and launched her first fashion collection, Psychadelic Jungle, in 1981. It was inspired by the strict dress code and atmosphere of London's Blitz Club during the early 1980s.

Hogg told the BBC's Kirsty Wark: "I started making clothes when I was about five years old from all the hand-me-downs from neighbours – more wealthy neighbours but they probably weren't that wealthy, just better off than us. And I was really formulating my look way back then."

The designer's clothes, as well as her personal visual identity, embraced futuristic beauty looks, bold hair, punk sensibilities, and a strong sense of androgyny.

One of her most memorable contributions to fashion is her interpretation of the catsuit.

It became a signature statement of her aesthetic and she continued to create catsuits throughout her career for stars such as Minogue, Rihanna and Lady Gaga.

Supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer and singers Jessie J, Björk, Siouxsie Sioux, Grace Jones and Kelly Rowland are among the other stars who wore Hogg's designs over the years.

In 1989, Hogg opened her first standalone boutique on Newburgh Street, just off Carnaby Street in London.

Princess Diana once wore one of Hogg's dresses, while Princess Eugenie wore one of her custom designs to Ascot in 2013.

In 2016, Hogg designed the statuette for the Brit Awards, producing 13 trophies characterised by her distinctive use of glitter and metallic tones.

Hogg was a music artist in her own right and supported Debbie Harry of Blondie and The Pogues, before founding the band Doll.

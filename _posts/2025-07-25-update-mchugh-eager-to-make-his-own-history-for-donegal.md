According to new developments, Ryan McHugh is eager to cap his Donegal career with an All-Ireland medal

Ryan McHugh says emulating his successful family members is not a primary motivation for this weekend's All-Ireland football final against Kerry.

McHugh's dad, Martin, and uncle, James, were key figures in Donegal's maiden All-Ireland win in 1992, while older brother Mark played when Sam Maguire returned to the hills in 2012.

Ryan joined Mark on the team that reached the 2014 final against Kerry but fell short and, although his older brother has progressed on to coaching, the younger of the Kilcar brothers is still a mainstay in the green and gold.

Although he would dearly love to get his own Celtic Cross this weekend, his desire to succeed is fuelled by a motivation to reach the top and banish the memories of the disappointing days since.

"I haven't got one yet, but it's nothing I think of," the 31-year-old told BBC Sport NI.

"Mark and dad had phenomenal careers for Donegal. Would I love an All-Ireland medal? Of course I would. It's over to me now to do that, but it's not something I think of that I have to get one because they did.

"I'm blessed to have been born at a time where Donegal have been in All-Ireland finals. As a supporter in 2012 and with Mark playing, it was unbelievable for the family. 

"Then in '14 with myself involved, it was massive for the family and for Donegal. It was disappointing in '14, but hopefully we can put that right this time."

McHugh celebrates this year's Ulster final win against Armagh

McHugh was just 20 when he lined out against The Kingdom in that 2014 defeat and with it being Donegal's second final in three years, he could have been forgiven they would be there or thereabouts in the years to come.

Sport doesn't work out that way and although there were Ulster title wins in 2018 and 2019, they just couldn't make the big breakthrough.

The return of Jim McGuinness as manager last year and Michael Murphy's decision to reverse his retirement have injected fresh impetus in Donegal football and with the county riding high again, McHugh is hopeful they can take the final step on Sunday.

"As a kid, you think you're going to maybe not make a final, but semi-finals and quarter-finals every couple of years," he said.

"It didn't work out that way for different reasons, but since Jim's back involved, we've been competing again, got to a semi-final last year and thankfully gone one better this year. It will mean nothing if we don't get over the line.

"There's no guarantee in life you're going to win anything, but when Jim's involved, there's a good chance you're going to compete for the top prizes."

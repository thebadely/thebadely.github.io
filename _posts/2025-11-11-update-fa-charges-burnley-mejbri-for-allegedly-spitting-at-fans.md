Here’s what you need to know: Hannibal Mejbri has been capped 37 times by Tunisia

Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for allegedly spitting towards Leeds United fans last month.

Mejbri, 22, came on as a substitute in the 83rd minute of the Premier League match between the sides at Turf Moor on 18 October, which the Clarets won 2-0.

But the alleged incident is said to have happened 16 minutes before his introduction, while the former Manchester United player was warming up.

Lancashire Police looked into the matter after a complaint was made by a Leeds fan in the away section of the ground.

An FA statement said: "It is alleged the player acted in breach of the laws of the game and/or in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or indecent behaviour by spitting at or in the direction of Leeds United supporters around the 67th minute.

"Hannibal Mejbri has until Friday 28 November to provide a response."

BBC Sport has contacted both Burnley and Leeds for comment. 

Tunisia international Mejbri joined Burnley from Manchester United in August 2024 in a deal which could eventually be worth Â£9.4m.

He has made 50 appearances in all competitions for the Clarets, scoring one goal.

It has been recently reported that Alfie Hewett was in the Royal Box at Wimbledon on Sunday 

Wimbledon 2025

Venue: All England Club Dates: 30 June-13 July 

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid were watching the Wimbledon action from the Royal Box on Saturday but now it is their turn to take to the court to defend their titles.

Hewett, 27, won the wheelchair men's singles title for the first time last year, while he and fellow Briton Reid claimed the men's wheelchair doubles title for the sixth time.

Victory over Spain's Martin de la Puente in the singles final made Hewett the first man since Reid in 2016 to win the Wimbledon singles and doubles in the same year.

Returning to the All England Club having finally won the singles title that had eluded him for so many years makes the tournament feel "different" this year. 

"It's a lot more enjoyable," he told BBC Sport.

"I look back at just being here and all the years that I've been here and to finally get that trophy last year was such a massive weight off my shoulders.

"I always felt that when I returned as defending champion, it would have a different feel to it."

Hewett has 30 Grand Slam titles - 10 in the singles and 22 in the doubles. Only Japanese legend Shingo Kunieda has won more majors in the men's game with 50.

He begins his singles title defence against Daniel Caverzaschi of Spain on Tuesday, while Reid is up against Belgian Joachim Gerard.

Reid was unable to play at Eastbourne just before Wimbledon because of illness but says he is now back to full health.

"It was out of my system after a couple of days," he said. "I'm back to full fitness and ready to go.

He and Hewett won their doubles title last year on Court One, but the 33-year-old hopes one day to compete in a final on Centre Court.

"I'm sure we're not the only ones that would love to play a match on Centre Court," he added.

"It would be a dream come true for us. To have a wheelchair tennis match on there during the Championships would be something totally iconic to the sport."

Experts revealed that Litton Das has been named captain of Bangladesh's squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup

Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.

Both of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.

The comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.

The BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.

All of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.

Asked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: "Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.

"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?

"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?"

One Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over Â£60,000.

Islam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).

"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable," Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.

"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow."

Neither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.

The BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: "Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.

"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction."

It said all cricketers should "display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.

Bangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.

The Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.

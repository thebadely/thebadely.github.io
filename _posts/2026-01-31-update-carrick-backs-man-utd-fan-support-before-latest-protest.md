Let's dive into the details: Michael Carrick applauded the Manchester United supporters after the victory over Manchester City on 17 January

Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick has praised the backing he has received from the club's fans and says he is "not offended" by the protest planned before Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham.

Carrick has a 100% record in his second spell in charge following unexpected wins against Manchester City and Arsenal.

Despite the improvement following Ruben Amorim's dismissal and the fact United moved into the Premier League top four for the first time this season following the Arsenal success, the 1958 fans' group is pushing ahead with its protest.

The group claims it expects between 5,000 and 6,000 fans to attend the protest march, although given it will start an hour before kick-off from either side of the stadium and meet in the middle by the 'Law, Best, Charlton' statue outside Old Trafford, exact numbers will be difficult to quantify.

Organisers say they have "a few surprises in store".

"Our protest has never been about performances on the pitch, not now, and not once in the last 21 years," they argue.

"We are judging a dysfunctional ownership model that has repeatedly failed."

In his autobiography, Carrick said the Glazer family were "great owners".

Few fans agree with those sentiments, regardless of whether they intend to join the protest or not.

Anti-Glazer songs are a feature of every game United play, while recently minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been the focus of negative supporter sentiment.

Asked for his thoughts on the issue, Carrick preferred to focus on the support both he and his team have received rather than address the wider issue.

"I don't think it [the protest] connects with the two wins, to be honest," he said.

"I fully respect the supporters. I'm not offended by it or anything, and the players certainly aren't.

"Within the stadium, the support we've felt, and that's been there for all the games that I've watched for quite some time, has been of the highest level and I'm sure it will continue to be like that.

"The connection we've had over the last couple of weeks has been pretty special and we've both fed off that. That's exactly how we wanted it to be and is something we need to keep building on moving forward."

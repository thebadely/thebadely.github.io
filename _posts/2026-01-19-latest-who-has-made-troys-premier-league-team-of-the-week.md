It has been recently reported that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Do you agree with Troy Deeney's team of the week?

Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): Coming off the back of a terrible week with his errors against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, you have to say he answered the questions the right way. Delivered against Brentford, made some big saves, kept Chelsea in the game and kept a clean sheet, which helps along the way.

Alex Jimenez (Bournemouth): He came off in the 90th minute of Monday's 1-1 draw at Brighton, cramped up, but a wonderful performer. Defended excellently, and the way he went forward was fantastic as well. Unfortunately, he couldn't keep a clean sheet right at the end, but he actually wasn't on the pitch for that situation, so he gets a pass for that.

Harry Maguire (Manchester United): Manchester United were excellent as they beat neighbours City on Saturday. I could've put the whole of the United team in this week, to be totally honest. However, having Harry Maguire back from his hamstring injury is huge for Michael Carrick. He was probably United's best player during Ruben Amorim's time in charge as well.

James Tarkowski (Everton): Wonderful performance in Sunday's win at Aston Villa. He gets in both for his attacking threat and also because defensively, he was a monster. I think he's one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. He's fantastic with the way he approaches the game and what he delivers.

Lewis Hall (Newcastle United): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile during Newcastle's 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday, and he's starting to make the case that he should be starting for England. That's how good he's been this season.

Crysencio Summerville (West Ham): He gets a goal - but it is more about the magnitude of the moment, and being able to get West Ham off to a flying start against Tottenham. With Saturday's 2-1 win, there is a little bit of hope now that they can get out of this mess that they find themselves in.

Ethan Ampadu (Leeds United): Every time Ampadu plays well, Leeds play well. Whenever they win, he is at the heart of everything. He got an assist as they beat Fulham on Saturday but the tackles and covering runs were more important. A top performance.

Enzo Le Fee (Sunderland): He is excellent. He has quality and he oozes class. He gives me the same feeling as when Carlos Tevez went to West Ham - you could see he was too good for that level. He picked up some brilliant positions against Crystal Palace, and also scored a wonderful goal in Sunderland's 2-1 win.

Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United):  He would have been a scorer in the Manchester derby if he had managed to stay onside, but he was the heart of the United performance. How many times are we going to say that? United are only as good as he drives them to be.

Patrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He seems a freer player since being moved up the pitch. There have been a lot of conversations about systems at United, but with Dorgu, one thing is clear - as a high left-sided player, he seems to have added a lot to his game. More goals helps as well.

Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United): Playing out of position in Saturday's derby, he ran his socks off, and delivered with a goal - a wonderful finish. He carried the team over the line. Hopefully now he can start to find the net more consistently for Manchester United.

Michael Carrick (Manchester United): A tough week for him. A lot of people, including Roy Keane and myself, were questioning whether he's good enough and things of that nature - or whether he even deserves the role. He answered emphatically. A wonderful, wonderful result. I think you have to say that's easily the manager's performance of the week. Now, can he back it up against Arsenal next week?

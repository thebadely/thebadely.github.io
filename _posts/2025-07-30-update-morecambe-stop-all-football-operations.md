Experts revealed that Morecambe finished bottom of League Two last season

The first team at Morecambe have stopped all football operations as the uncertainty around the future of the club continues.

The Shrimps were suspended by the National League until 20 August on Monday over a failure to comply with the league's rules.

London-based sports investment company Panjab Warriors, who have been in talks with the club's owner Jason Whittingham for more than a year, released a statement to say they remain "ready, willing and able" to take over.

However, they have confirmed that the takeover has not been finalised and have "implored" the current owners to complete the sale.

A joint statement issued by Panjab Warriors, minority shareholders, the Shrimps Trust and the local MP Lizzi Collinge said: "The first team have had to stop all football operations as the required insurance which was in place has now lapsed as payment has not been made.

"As a result of this escalating situation more first team players have left the club, with further players set to leave by the end of this week."

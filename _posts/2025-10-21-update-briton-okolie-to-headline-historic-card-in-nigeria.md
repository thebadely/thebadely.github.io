It has been recently reported that Lawrence Okolie's only loss as a professional came against Chris Billam-Smith in 2023

British heavyweight Lawrence Okolie is set to headline a card in Nigeria on 19 December. 

The former cruiserweight and bridgerweight world champion's opponent in Lagos - on a card promoted by Queensberry's Frank Warren and Amir Khan - is yet to be announced.

Okolie's parents were born in Nigeria and the 32-year-old is set for his first professional bout in Africa, which is one of boxing's emerging markets.

It comes as Eddie Hearn's Matchroom hold a show in Ghana on 20 December, with reports of Anthony Joshua potentially fighting in either Ghana or Nigeria at the start of next year. 

"Big time boxing comes to Lagos!" said Okolie, who has a record of 22 wins, 16 stoppages and one loss. 

"This will be a historic moment for Africa, my family and my career.

"There's been a lot of talk, but let's see who really wants to dance...

"Thanks to Frank [Warren], George [Warren] and Queensberry for making this happen for me."

Former light-welterweight world champion Khan, the head of AK Promotions, said: "Lagos is about to witness something special. 

"This event brings together explosive heavyweights and Nigeria's rising stars...

"I'm proud to be part of a night that will inspire the next generation of African fighters."

British heavyweight contender David Adeleye, whose parents are Nigerian, will also feature on the card.

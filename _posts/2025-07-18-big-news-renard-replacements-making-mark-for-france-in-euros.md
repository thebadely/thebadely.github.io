When Wendie Renard was left out of the France squad for Euro 2025, it sent shockwaves through women's football.

After all, the 34-year-old centre-back was the country's captain and had a wealth of experience from 168 international caps and a highly decorated club career with Lyon.

"She is one of the best defenders in the world," said Syanie Dalmat, a reporter for French sports newspaper L'Equipe.

"Even if she had some injuries, she was always good on the pitch when she played - so the decision was not easy to understand."

Instead of Renard, France manager Laurent Bonadei chose to bring four centre-backs who, before the Euros, had made 133 appearances for their country between them.

However, his plan seems to be paying off in Switzerland as France topped Group D - widely considered the most difficult of the pools - to establish themselves as serious title contenders as they search for a maiden major trophy.

Two 21-year-olds - Thiniba Samoura and Alice Sombath - have flourished in Renard's absence, making their mark in the group stage as the more experienced Griedge Mbock and Maelle Lakrar missed out because of injuries.

"It is their first big competition and I think they've done a very good job. Even if the French conceded a goal in each game, I think there is satisfaction in the defence," Dalmat said.

But with Mbock and Lakrar both fit again, who will Bonadei choose for France's quarter-final against Germany?

Sombath, who plays alongside Renard for Lyon, has started every game in Switzerland, impressing with her commanding style in France's 2-1 win against defending champions England in their opener.

"Sombath was incredible against England. She's very young but she's very calm, she's a leader and she's the future of the French team," French football reporter Morgane Huguen said.

Dalmat added: "She has a tough maturity. She's a young player, but when she plays in central defence she looks like she's the boss." 

Samoura, meanwhile, has shown her ability with her feet, having played as a centre-midfielder, right-back and centre-back for Paris St-Germain last season.

"I have athletic and technical qualities. I also try to break the lines. That's what I do best," Samoura explained in a news conference on Monday.

Dalmat added: "She can take the ball from the back and break some lines, and she's not afraid of taking some risks with the ball at her feet."

But Bonadei, who has been unpredictable with his team selections since taking charge in October, has a decision to make against Germany.

The France boss confirmed in his news conference on Friday that captain Mbock would indeed start, but it remains uncertain who will line up alongside her.

"Against a team like that, France will need some experience," Dalmat said. "Even if I think Samoura and Sombath have done well, Mbock and Lakrar have much, much more experience, and in a game like this, experience is crucial."

Asked whether she was fearful of returning after more than a month out with a calf injury, Mbock said she was "not scared". 

"I trust my team-mates, I know others can help me and fill any gaps if I lack pace. I am lucky, I am in collective sport, I can count on team-mates," she added.

While there is "satisfaction" in the France backline, Germany have a host of defensive problems to solve.

The eight-time champions' title hopes suffered a huge blow in their opener against Poland as their captain Giulia Gwinn limped off the pitch in tears with a medial ligament injury in her left knee.

After beating Poland and Denmark, things fell apart for Christian Wuck's side in their final group game against Sweden.

Gwinn's replacement Carlotta Wamser had impressed with a superb assist for Jule Brand for Germany's opener, but the right-back was shown a red card for a goalline block with her hand to deny Stina Blackstenius.

Germany were 2-1 down at the time, but the resulting penalty and extra-player advantage sent Sweden on their way to a commanding 4-1 victory.

They will now go into their quarter-final without an obvious replacement for both their first choice and back-up right-back, leaving boss Wuck with a major defensive headache.

Franziska Kett is likely to make her first start of the tournament, lining up as left-back with Sarai Linder moving to the right.

Asked about Kett, Wuck said: "She's very quick with her left foot, she has incredibly good will and she's able to defeat people in duels."

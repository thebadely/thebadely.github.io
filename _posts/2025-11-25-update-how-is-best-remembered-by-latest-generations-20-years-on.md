According to new developments, George Best was as famous for his life away from the pitch as he was for his football on it

Maradona good, Pele better, George Best. 

It's a famous saying to judge three of the best footballers in the 20th century.

On 25 November, it will be 20 years since George Best passed away, and almost 60 years since he was at the peak of his powers.

A footballing genius, he was one of the first superstars in football but his life away from the game ensured he was on the front pages of the newspapers, as well as the back. 

In fact, such was his fame off the pitch he was dubbed the "fifth Beatle" by Portuguese press, and by his mid-20s his celebrity lifestyle had started to overtake his football in a slope that would never reverse.

But that does not detract from the footballing genius. 

A legend at Manchester United, he was a key player as they won the European Cup for the first time in 1968, which led him to win the Ballon d'Or that year, as well as two league titles.

Regarded as Northern Ireland's most iconic figure, where he is still idolised to this day, Best is also considered one of the greatest players never to feature at a World Cup. 

Whether it was his European Cup performance against Benfica, the double hat-trick for United in the FA Cup or the infamous 'goal' against England, where he kicked the ball out of the hands of Gordon Banks and scored before it was eventually ruled out - Best's genius on the pitch stood out in an era of greats. 

After 11 years at Old Trafford, Best's time at the top would fall away by the time he was 28. The final years of his career were littered with short spells across the world and in lower leagues.

He was still a figure that drew crowds, but the magic had fizzled out. 

As former Northern Ireland defender John O'Neill said: "He was one of the best players to ever play the game. He unfortunately didn't play long enough."

But in Northern Ireland, his legacy has never been forgotten. He is by far the most famous sporting export from his country.

The airport in the city bears his name, and in 2019 a statue was erected outside Windsor Park.

There was a minute's applause ahead of Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg to mark 20 years since his passing. 

As it always does in games, both home and away, Best's song reverberated around Windsor Park both before and during the match. 

For current Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill, it was a fitting tribute.

"Obviously we know what George means to football and what he means to people in Northern Ireland particularly. I thought it was lovely to see both the stadium and the players recognise the impact that George had here as a footballer."

O'Neill said that Best was "one of football's first superstars" and he would "last through the ages".

"The players come to the ground and they see a statue of George Best outside the stadium when we arrive.

"I think they know the impact George had on the game, and I think we all know what George Best means to everyone in Northern Ireland."

Those of a certain age will remember Best's playing days, and those alive for the time of his funeral will have heard the full extent of his on-pitch genius. 

But for the younger generation, in an era when Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated the 'greatest ever' debate, Best's name perhaps does not carry the same weight as before. 

But it is now the stories and videos which stand stronger than ever before and, in truth, word of mouth and grainy footage only enhances his legend.

"My dad is a massive football fan and he always used to show me videos of him when I was a lot younger," Northern Ireland striker Jamie Donley, 20, said.

"But now you realise how special of a player he was. Everyone looks up to him really.

"Having him on the screen brought back all the memories of videos of seeing him."

For midfielder Patrick Kelly, who was only a one-year-old when Best passed away, it was also stories and memories from his dad that left the lasting impression. 

"All I know is that he was unbelievable. I've watched a lot of documentaries and shows with my dad growing up, and he never shut up about George Best and how good he was," Kelly said.

"Obviously I could never see him live but I've seen clips of everything he did for Manchester United and Northern Ireland, so you know how good he was and how much of an icon he is here."

Whether you are young or old, Best's footballing legacy will live on for generations to come.

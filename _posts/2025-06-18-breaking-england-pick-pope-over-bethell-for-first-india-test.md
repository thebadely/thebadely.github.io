England have retained Ollie Pope at number three for the first Test against India at Headingley on Friday, meaning Jacob Bethell misses out.

Vice-captain Pope would have been the most vulnerable member of the top order had England wanted to include 21-year-old Bethell.

Bethell has never made a professional century, but looks set for a big future in international cricket. He impressed with three half-centuries in three Tests against New Zealand last year and again in making 82 in the first one-day international against West Indies last month.

England have resisted change in sticking with Pope, who made 171 in the defeat of Zimbabwe - a Test Bethell missed because he was playing for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League.

Before that Test, captain Ben Stokes appeared to hint Bethell would make an immediate return to the England XI, only to later clarify he was referring to the squad and claimed his words were "twisted to suit an agenda".

And Stokes has kept faith with Pope at the beginning of a defining period for his captaincy. The five Tests against India are followed by an Ashes tour of Australia.

In return, Pope will need to improve on his record against Australia and India. In a combined 18 Tests against the two, he averages 22.05, compared to his career mark of 35.49.

Elsewhere, the England XI is as expected, with pace bowlers Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse returning in place of Sam Cook and Gus Atkinson as the two changes from the Zimbabwe Test.

The players will wear black armbands and a short silence will be observed before the anthems before play on the first day in respect to those who died in the Ahmedabad air crash.

England v India: Pope gets picked ahead of Bethell

'Woakes return more important than ever to England'

How does new captain Gill compare to India batting greats?

Woakes, who has missed England's past two Tests, has recovered from an ankle injury, while Carse will play his first home Test after overcoming a foot problem.

Carse could be in line to share the new ball with Woakes, despite usually operating as a change bowler. The Durham man has opened the bowling on 16 occasions in the 94 first-class innings in which he has bowled, managing a combined 2-246 in those spells.

"I'm relishing that opportunity, if that is what it is," Carse told BBC Sport. "I opened the bowling during the one-day series against West Indies, and felt comfortable and confident. If that opportunity awaits, it's something I'm looking forward to."

Cook and Jamie Overton are the seamers in the squad to miss out, while Atkinson is sidelined with a hamstring injury.

Atkinson is expected to return later in the series and was at England's training session at Headingley on Wednesday. Another pace bowler working towards a comeback is Jofra Archer, whose long-awaited return to red-ball cricket is gathering pace.

A string of injuries has meant the 30-year-old has not played first-class or Test cricket since 2021.

After overcoming a thumb problem, Archer is in line to play for Sussex in the County Championship at Durham, starting on Sunday.

If he comes through that, Archer could be in line to return for the second Test against India at Edgbaston, or third Test at Lord's.

India are yet to announce their XI, but will have a new-look top order after the retirements of captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli since their tour of Australia in January.

Rishabh Pant confirmed he would stay at five, with new captain Shubman Gill at four, in Wednesday's news conference.

On the evolving India team, Carse said: "They have lost two of their most established, world-class batters, but we all know the quality that India have.

"Whatever side they put out, they will have a lot of quality. It will certainly bring different challenges, and it's exciting. Two good sides going against each other, with the same goal."

After all the speculation over how to get Bethell into the side, England have decided to stick rather than twist.

There were plenty of suggestions of how he could fit in, possibly replacing opener Zak Crawley, spinner Shoaib Bashir, or even keeper Jamie Smith with the gloves passed to Pope. Realistically, it was always a straight choice between Pope and Bethell at number three.

On the surface, it should be a no-brainer. At 21, without a professional century to his name, Bethell should not lay a glove on Pope and his average in excess of 43 at first-drop.

But Pope's results are often feast or famine, and he can be a skittish presence at the crease. In his short international career so far, Bethell has looked calm, technically correct and suited to the highest level.

England, never shy of making bold decisions, would have been tempted by Bethell's promise and added bonus of left-arm spin.

In the end they have opted for Pope's experience, perhaps thinking they owe him some loyalty. In the past year alone, he has stood in as captain, wicketkeeper and opener. He has done nothing to deserve to be dropped, so England may think it sends a destabilising message to leave out their vice-captain without a dramatic slump in form.

Now Pope has to repay the faith, against India and Australia, two teams he has historically struggled against.

Bethell's time will come. His mere presence in the squad is a reminder to the whole England top-order that the pressure in on. The team should be stronger for the competition.

Pant is also hoping that the start of the series can "make India happy again" after the tragic plane crash in Ahmedabad last week.

In total 241 passengers, including 52 Britons, were killed when an Air India flight to London Gatwick went down soon after take-off.

British national Vishwash Kumar Ramesh was the sole survivor.

"What happened with the aircraft, the whole of India was saddened by it," Pant said.

"The only thing is how can we make India happy again?

"The emotion is going to be high always because of what happened in the crash but, at the same time, we are going to put our best foot forward for the country.

"How we can make them happy is an added responsibility."

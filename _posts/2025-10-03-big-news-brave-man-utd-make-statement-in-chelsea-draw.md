Manchester United v Chelsea WSL

It was a "statement" performance, but Manchester United were still left wanting more than the point they took from a side that has won the last six Women's Super League titles.

United ended Chelsea's 100% start to the new season as Anna Sandberg's sublime volley cancelled out Wieke Kaptein's exquisite opener.

It was a significant result for the Red Devils, who had lost 10 and drawn one of their 11 previous league encounters with the Blues.

Yet boss Marc Skinner was "disappointed" United came away with one rather than all three points as they extended their unbeaten run to five games.

Ella Toone wasted chances either side of the interval, while Jess Park should have done better with a chipped effort, before coming close with a dipping volley.

"I felt like Manchester United will probably be kicking themselves," ex-England midfielder Fara Williams told BBC Three.

"They created a lot of good chances and maybe if they had better composure in their final third to execute, they would have come out on top."

However, United could have just as easily walked away with nothing.

Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce made a superb late save to deny Chelsea's Keira Walsh, while both defenders Maya Le Tissier and Sandberg put their bodies on the line in the closing stages to keep the Blues at bay.

"They're the first team to take points off Chelsea this season," former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis added on BBC Three.

"If they need to put out a statement to their own club and reaffirm what Manchester United's ambition is, they've earned every bit of that."

Man Utd end Chelsea's 100% record in thrilling draw

Midfielder Jess Park said "it's really coming together" for United this season

The big question at the start of this season - the same one that's been asked over the last six WSL campaigns - is whether anyone can end Chelsea's dominance.

The Blues won last term's trophy by going 22 games unbeaten in Sonia Bompastor's first season at the helm - part of a domestic treble as they lifted the Women's FA Cup and League Cup too.

In fact, it's been more than 500 days since Chelsea last lost a league game - a 4-3 defeat at Liverpool on 1 May, 2024.

Manchester United came close to ending that streak on Friday night in a top-two encounter and Skinner was proud of "the most brave performance" from his players. 

"We're building. You can see it, you can sense it," he said.

"We are disappointed to not win the game. The chances we created, not many teams could create that against Chelsea. So for us to do that and in the way we did it was credit to them [the players]."

Since their promotion from the Women's Championship in 2019, United have rapidly emerged as WSL title contenders, finishing just two points behind Chelsea in 2022-23.

The following season they won the FA Cup - their first major women's trophy.

While a draw against the current league leaders may be deemed a missed opportunity for United, former England striker White believed it showed how far the club has come.

"You have to look at that consistency," she said. "They've played 11 times against Chelsea now and only drawn once, now the second time, so I think it's really good for their consistency and what they're doing as a club and a team.

"It shows it's working and they're improving."

Asked if Skinner deserved more credit for United's rise to compete with more established clubs, White added: "What he's done with these players, the philosophy, the DNA, how resolute they are. 

"He hasn't got the amount of money or been able to spend the amount of money the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal or [Manchester] City have done."

Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal are the only three unbeaten teams in the league this season

Chelsea's perfect start may have ended, but they still remain top on 13 points - two points clear of United.

But Skinner said his side's display at the Progress With Unity Stadium - where Chelsea clinched last season's title - proved the Blues won't have it quite as easy this time around.

"It shows to Chelsea they're not just going to walk the league," he added.

"We need to make sure everyone is putting a challenge in. I think the league is getting better and you saw the quality, that we are progressing too."

Blues boss Bompastor was "not happy" with Chelsea's performance, but said a draw was "not a bad result at Manchester United".

Asked if United were title challengers, she added: "I see many teams being real competition for us, every game brings a different challenge. You have to be ready for every game."

Manchester City, who lost to Chelsea in the season opener, could close the gap on the leaders to one point if they beat Arsenal at home on Saturday (12:00 BST).

Last season's runners-up Arsenal, meanwhile, have ground to make up after dropping points against both United and Aston Villa, and boss Renee Slegers will be eyeing the Gunners' home game against Chelsea on 8 November as a way to get themselves back in contention.

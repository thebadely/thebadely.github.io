Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Luke Humphries was runner-up in last year's tournament

World number one Luke Humphries moved into the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix in Leicester with a comfortable 3-1 win over Krzysztof Ratajski.

Humphries, 30, was champion in 2023 and runner-up last year, and reached the last eight after a half-time adjustment - hitting six 180s and averaging 95.58 at the 'double in, double out' tournament.

He said: "I went off at the break and said to myself 'you must be doing something different because you don't play like this usually'.

"So I slowed my throw down and I started hitting the trebles. On the practice board I am hitting everything and then I am going out there and not, so I needed to change something."

Fourth seed Stephen Bunting was dumped out by 2021 semi-finalist Danny Noppert, while two-time world champion Gary Anderson breezed past Joe Cullen.

Cullen only averaged 68.05 and won just one leg.

Anderson told Sky Sports: "Joe was miles off tonight, his starting off is what cost him.

"My scoring came on at the end. It's been a while since I went far in this tournament, it's getting harder and harder for me.

"Darts is a joy but I still want to win."

Reigning champion Mike de Decker is in action on Thursday against Luke Littler.

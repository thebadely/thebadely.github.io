It has been recently reported that Louis Rees-Zammit played for Gloucester before his move to the NFL

Wales have recalled wing Louis Rees-Zammit for their autumn Tests, two years after he last played for his country and switched from rugby union to American football.

Despite winning contracts with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars during an 18-month period, Rees-Zammit did not play a competitive NFL game.

The 24-year-old returned to rugby in August by signing a season-long deal at Bristol Bears, for whom he made a try-scoring debut in the Gallagher Prem.

New head coach Steve Tandy's first squad for the four matches in November also features recalls for Saracens prop Rhys Carre and Cardiff fly-half Callum Sheedy.

But Cardiff's in-form teenage wing Tom Bowen misses out on a first call-up, while experienced Ospreys and Leicester back rows Ross Moriarty and Tommy Reffell are overlooked.

There are five uncapped players in the 39-man squad: Ospreys second row James Fender and back row Morgan Morse, Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan, Cardiff prop Danny Southworth and Bath centre Louie Hennessey.

British and Irish Lions flanker Jac Morgan returns to lead the 744-cap squad, which has an average age of 26.

On Rees-Zammit, Tandy said: "I think we're getting a special athlete and a special mindset to go and try something new. Most people are probably not brave enough to experience something different and that was a big jump so that tells you a lot about him as a person and his mentality.

"He says to me that he's definitely faster and bigger since he's come back, so that's good for us to hear. We've got to build a game where we can get him in the game more often. Not only him, but we've got lots of other exciting players."

Bristol head coach Pat Lam said: "It's massive for Zam, it's well deserved. At this stage he's rehabbing but we, he, Wales [are] hoping he'll be right for Argentina.

"His rehab's going really well, it's a couple of weeks. Wales are happy, the medical teams are happy that he's on track so this is a massive part for him as well."

Wales' players will assemble at their training base on the outskirts of Cardiff on Monday, 27 October.

Tandy will then begin his tenure with a match against Argentina on Sunday, 9 November, with Tests against Japan, New Zealand and South Africa to follow.

Those fixtures, which will be broadcast live on BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru,  represent a formidable first assignment for ex-Scotland defence coach Tandy.

He takes over a Wales side ranked 12th in the world and one that only broke an 18-match international losing sequence by beating Japan in Kobe in July.

"It's been really exciting going through the whole process and realising how many good players we've got," said Tandy.

"There's a really good mix of some young guys coming in, mixed with some experience as well. But the overall feeling is really exciting and I can't wait to get the boys into camp on Monday. 

"It's a new time and there are some new faces in and around the playing group as well."

Carre has started the season strongly with Saracens, but was ineligible under Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) selection policy because he has 20 caps, five short of the required number for those playing for clubs outside Wales.

But in its statement confirming the squad, the WRU said Carre had been "included following confirmation by the Professional Rugby Board that he is eligible for Wales selection".

Second rows Adam Beard and Dafydd Jenkins are back having missed the two-Test series in Japan over the summer because of being given a break and elective surgery respectively.

There are also returns for Jacob Beetham, Rhys Davies, Rio Dyer, Jarrod Evans, Joe Hawkins, Max Llewellyn and Nick Tompkins.

However, fellow lock Will Rowlands is not included having announced his retirement from international rugby shortly before the squad was published on Tuesday.

Let's dive into the details: Many of the front pages focus on the latest report from the Covid inquiry. 

"Toxic, chaotic, calamitous" are three words chosen by the Metro, as it notes that while Boris Johnson was castigated, all of the UK governments were found to have done "too little, too late". The Daily Mirror says the former prime minister's handling of the crisis was "inexcusable," as it highlights the finding that he repeated mistakes. The Guardian says the report "put paid to any delusions that he had the qualities necessary to be a prime minister, let alone one guiding a country through a deadly national emergency." The i Paper says any ambitions of a return to political life are now delusional. The Daily Star calls Johnson the "killer clown." The Sun describes the verdicts as predictable, but damning, and says the state must ensure that the mistakes are not repeated in any future public health crisis.

But some analysis takes a different approach. In its editorial, the Daily Mail - for whom Johnson now writes a column - argues, that "of course things would have been done better had the politicians involved known then what they know now. But how could they?" The Daily Telegraph says the "costliest inquiry in British history tells us what we already knew - that lockdown was not necessary." It quotes the cancer specialist - and lockdown sceptic - Professor Karol Sikora as saying the report "has no scientific credibility at all - just lots of pretty ignorant lawyers and ex-politicians milking the system for fame, fortune and glory." 

"It's amazing what £200m worth of hindsight can buy you," suggests the Times sketchwriter, Tom Peck.

Many of the papers pay tribute to the Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist Gary Mounfield - best known as Mani - who has died at 63. The Guardian's music critic, Alexis Petridis, says Mani's funky bass taught indie kids how to dance. The Mirror says he was the soul of the Stone Roses. For the Times, he was the "beating heart" of the band. Nodding to one of the band's biggest hits, the Sun says "you WERE adored, Mani".

Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played

Late Amad volley scrapes back point for Man Utd

Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche described the decision to award Manchester United a corner in the build-up to the visitors' opener at the City Ground on Saturday as "farcical".

Nicolo Savona's clearance from Bryan Mbeumo's delivery was heading out of play, but the Italian full-back chased after his own header and appeared to stop the whole ball from crossing the byeline.

However, linesman Akil Howson signalled that the ball had gone out of play, prompting referee Darren England to award the corner - from which Casemiro put Ruben Amorim's side in front in a game which ended 2-2.

Under current laws, the video assistant referee (VAR) cannot review decisions that involve awarding a corner instead of a goal-kick, even if the corner leads to a goal.

"There has to be someone who overrides this decision, because it's gone and they've put it straight in the goal," said Dyche, whose side also conceded a controversially awarded corner in last weekend's 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth.

"Two in two weeks is farcical," continued Dyche. "You might get one of those [decisions] a season.

"Of course you can argue about us dealing with it, but the point is it's the wrong decision. What's even worse is that the assistant referee has given it from 75 yards away, behind the view of the goal. Apparently he can see it.

"We can clearly see the ball hanging over the line. Whether it's three quarters or not is irrelevant, the fact is it's not out. It's really disappointing."

Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer sympathised with Dyche and said the officials got it wrong.

"Sean Dyche has got a point," he said. "I'm not sure how the assistant over on the far side can see that far and be absolutely certain that ball is out because it isn't and he was nearly 70 yards away.

"I agree with Sean and understand his frustration and his anger. I wouldn't like to get VAR involved as it is stopping and starting as it is. I wouldn't encourage that, but I would encourage the officials to do their job properly and get it right, not guess. He has guessed there and got it wrong."

Two goals in three second-half minutes, from Morgan Gibbs-White and Savona, put Forest on course for a first win under new manager Dyche.

But Amad Diallo's thunderous effort rescued a point for United nine minutes from time.

Experts revealed that The Transport Secretary has told air passengers to assume the 100ml limit on liquids in hand luggage remains in place despite two airports changing their policies.   

Edinburgh and Birmingham airports have installed new scanners which allow bottles of up to two litres to be taken on board planes. 

But other airports around the UK are at different stages of putting technology in place that would mean the near 20-year-old rule on liquids could be relaxed.    

Heidi Alexander said: "You should work on the basis that it is 100ml at the moment unless you have heard from your airport otherwise." 

The new scanning machines use CT X-ray technology, meaning that passengers at airports in Birmingham and Edinburgh can do away with clear plastic bags filled with tiny toiletries that must be removed from luggage for inspection. 

Terminals have undergone complex and costly processes to install the new scanners.

They are heavy and some airports have had to reinforce floors to install them. Meanwhile, there are only a handful of manufacturers that make the scanners resulting in restricted supplies and delays to installation. 

Alexander told Times Radio: "The rollout of this new technology, the new scanning technology, has been overseen by the individual airports themselves. They have different contracts in place, different providers."

While she said she was hopeful the technology could be rolled out sooner rather than later so flyers "have that extra added flexibility", she said: "I always advise people to check in with their airlines and their airports before travelling."

Sources in the industry said described the approach to installing the scanners as "haphazard", with the issue of not having a consistent policy approach from government.

A spokesperson for AirportsUK, said: "Aviation security procedures around liquids are evolving and this change will take place at different times at different airports."

AirportsUK advised passengers to check security arrangements at every airport. "We would stress this involves return airports abroad as well as those in the UK, as rules will be evolving there too," it said. 

The rollout of the scanners across Europe has also been inconsistent.

Last summer, the European Union had to revert back to 100ml rules because of a technical issue with new equipment.

The 100ml onboard liquid rule was introduced in 2006 as part of enhanced security measures following a series of terror-related incidents after two planes flew into the World Trade Centre's Twin Towers in New York on 11 September, 2001.

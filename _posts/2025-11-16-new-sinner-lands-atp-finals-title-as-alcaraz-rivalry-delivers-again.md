Experts revealed that Jannik Sinner has won each of his past three tournaments to finish 2025 on a 15-match unbeaten streak

Jannik Sinner is relishing more "great battles" with Carlos Alcaraz in 2026 after overcoming the world number one in two tight sets to defend his ATP Finals crown in Turin.

For the second consecutive year, the Italian captured the title without dropping a set throughout the tournament, winning 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 in the final, and is now unbeaten in 31 consecutive matches on indoor hard courts.

It was Sinner's second victory in six finals against Spaniard Alcaraz this season and closed the gap in their head-to-head record to 10-6.

The duo have dominated the 2025 men's tour calendar, winning a combined 14 titles, including all four Grand Slams, and the 'Sincaraz' rivalry went stratospheric in June when Alcaraz fought back from two sets down and saved three championship points to win a Roland Garros epic.

The Spaniard also triumphed in Rome, Cincinnati and at the US Open, but Sinner, who came out on top at Wimbledon, had the final word in front of home support.

"You are definitely a player I look up to, a lot of motivation. I hope to see you again next year with great battles ahead of us," said Sinner, who pockets just over $5million (Â£3.85m) as champion, as he addressed Alcaraz.

"It was a close match-up. [Alcaraz had] set point in the first set and I'm happy with how I handed the situation. It means the world to me. Playing against Carlos, you have to play your best."

Alcaraz, who has won seven of their past nine meetings, is similarly keen to renew their rivalry next year, issuing a friendly warning.

"It is a great year for Jannik and now time to rest. I hope you are going to be ready for next year because I will be ready. Hopefully I will play more finals against you," Alcaraz said at the post-match presentation.

Despite missing out on the year-end number one ranking, Sinner said there could be "no better ending" to 2025.

A successful year on court saw him add two Grand Slam titles to his collection, including a maiden Wimbledon triumph, and reach all four major finals.

He missed three months of the season to serve a doping ban but still collected six titles â the second-best haul of his career â after reaching the final in 10 of the 12 tournaments he entered.

This latest win extends his prolific record at the end-of-season showpiece event, where he has not lost a match since being defeated by Novak Djokovic in the 2023 final.

Sinner becomes just the fourth player to successfully retain the men's singles title this century, joining Lleyton Hewitt, Roger Federer and Djokovic.

All signs point to more dominance by 22-year-old Alcaraz and 24-year-old Sinner in the new year, and more contests played at this high level can only be a good thing for the sport.

After the first 11 games came and went without a break point, Sinner was forced to save set point with a huge second serve.

He then dominated the tie-break, capitalising on a run of backhand errors from Alcaraz and executing a couple of pinpoint lobs, to seal the first set.

His usually reliable serve faltered in the opening game of the second, with a pair of untimely double faults gifting Alcaraz, sporting a bandaged right thigh after receiving treatment earlier in the match, an early break.

However, Sinner hit back with a break of his own in the sixth game before saving a break point in the seventh to keep the set on serve, whipping the crowd into a frenzy with each point he won.

With Alcaraz serving to stay in the match in the 12th game, Sinner forced deuce with a down-the-line backhand before dropping to the floor as consecutive errors from his opponent confirmed the Italian's successful title defence.

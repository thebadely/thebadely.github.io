Experts revealed that Thomas Frank has won six, drawn four and lost six of his Premier League matches in charge of Tottenham

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank says he "feels supported" by the club despite their recent run of poor results and his players are "with me or going in the same direction." 

Frank's side were beaten 3-0 by Nottingham Forest last weekend and have posted just one win in their past seven Premier League games. 

They sit 11th in the table with 22 points from 16 games before facing defending champions Liverpool on Saturday. 

And before the Reds' visit to north London, Spurs centre-back Micky van de Ven said in an interview that he "never expected" the club to sack Frank's predecessor Ange Postecoglou and claimed to "still believe" in the Australian's system.

Asked whether it was difficult for the players to buy into his system, Frank said: "No, I think it has been a good buy-in. 

"You could say that from the beginning of the season we started quite well without being sensational.

"I thought we were very good in some games and good in other games. Like in every season, you have some setbacks and spells where it is maybe not going the right way, but I don't see anything that they're not with me or going in the same direction."

Frank has endured a difficult start to life at Tottenham since joining them in June after seven years at Brentford, who he guided from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021.

The Dane's performance had come under increasing internal scrutiny following a home defeat by Fulham on 29 November which came as part of a run of one win in eight, while sections of Spurs supporters have also voiced frustrations with Frank. 

However, the manager insists he retains the backing from the club hierarchy.

"I feel supported. I've done that the whole time," said the 52-year-old. 

"This is not a quick fix. This will take time. That's not to say that we're not going to do everything we can to beat Liverpool. 

"I'm very comfortable and confident that I will, how can I say, fix it, but just to make sure it's not me. When this club comes out on top, there will be a lot of good people working together, aligned at the same time through the years.

"I just know one thing I'm pretty good at - I'm good at analysing things. I know what good looks like and I know where we should get [to], and... I'm 1,000% sure we haven't seen any club be successful unless they had key people in the right positions for a long time.

"And I'll back myself to be one of those key people to be in that position."

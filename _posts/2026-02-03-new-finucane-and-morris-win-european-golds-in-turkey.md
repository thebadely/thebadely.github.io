Here’s what you need to know: Sprint runner-up Sophie Capewell (left) and winner Emma Finucane (right) won gold in the women's team sprint at the 2024 Olympics

Emma Finucane and Anna Morris won gold for Great Britain on day three of the 2026 UEC Track Elite European Championships in Turkey.

Olympic and former world champion Finucane, 23, came into the third day of action in Konya in fine form after setting a new world record for the women's flying 200m time-trial on Monday.

In the final of the women's sprint, Finucane's time of 10.608 seconds was 0.045secs faster than team-mate Sophie Capewell to secure her second gold medal of the event.

Finucane said after her win: "Yesterday I wanted to execute my ride perfectly, and I did; I came away with a world record and I couldn't believe it. 

"But it doesn't finish there, you still have to race races and the girls were really fast, there was lots of fast sprinting and to come away with this medal and with this jersey means so so much to me. "

Finucane's Welsh compatriot, Olympic bronze medalist Morris, dominated the women's omnium to win her third European Championship gold medal. 

Morris, who said the "European jersey is really special", finished 13 points in front of Norway's Anita Stenberg.

Matt Bostock finished fourth in the men's individual pursuit.

Great Britain have won seven medals in Turkey, including four golds.

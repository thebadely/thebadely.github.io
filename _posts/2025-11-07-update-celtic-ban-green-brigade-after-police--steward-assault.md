Experts revealed that The Green Brigade sit in the north curve section of Celtic Park

Celtic have banned the Green Brigade fan group for three home matches after "violent and threatening behaviour" at the recent match against Falkirk.

The Scottish champions have released footage which they say shows "around 100" supporters verbally abusing and assaulting a steward and two police officers on Wednesday, 29 October.

The alleged flashpoint came after a ticket inspection at the rail seating section of Celtic Park, the club explained.

The Green Brigade were issued a suspended sanction in the summer following "repeated serious safety and security-related breaches", with Celtic now taking further action.

"Following this latest incident, the club can confirm that this sanction will now be applied, beginning from this weekend," read a statement.

"The club has written to the Green Brigade group and also to our season ticket holders regarding this incident.

"For our staff and police to be assaulted in this way is simply unacceptable. This was a serious and violent incident which cannot be accepted and the club has no choice but to address this behaviour in the strongest terms.

"Celtic Park cannot be a place for this kind of behaviour and the club must act in the wider interests and safety of everyone who attends our matches."

Footage published by the club appears to show a group of fans rushing down a walkway underneath the stand and out of sight.

As the clip progresses, more supporters hurry across the front of the section to the concourse, before later reappearing.

Police Scotland have issued an appeal for witnesses following the incident.

"We utterly condemn the unacceptable disorder on Wednesday, 29 October, 2025, within Celtic Park after two officers and a steward were assaulted by a large group of fans," said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Sutherland.  

"No-one should be harmed or intimidated while carrying out their duties and being assaulted is not part of the job. This type of violent behaviour will not be tolerated, and we are doing everything we can to trace those involved and hold them accountable.

"The officers and steward were left extremely shaken and traumatised by the incident and are being offered support.

"We'd urge anyone with information about these assaults and disorder to contact us as soon as possible on 101 quoting reference PS-20251029-2196 Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111."

The Green Brigade later confirmed the ban is for "at least six matches" since it includes three away trips, referring to the action as a "further attack on supporters".

The ultras fan group state: "The justification for the ban is disingenuous, similar to previous bans."

The Green Brigade claim the suspended sentence was applied for displaying Palestine flags and call its activation "fundamentally unfair" and "totally unprecedented".

They go on to "categorically refute" the allegations of violence and "contest that Celtic FC and Police Scotland were both the architects and aggressors in this incident." 

Their statement refers to "another instance of police harassment" and suggests that the ban is intended to "cynically lock-out anti-board sentiment".

In October 2023, a section of the Green Brigade had their season tickets withdrawn indefinitely by the club, following a "serious escalation" of unacceptable behaviour.

The ban was subsequently lifted in December after the group agreed to comply with a new safety code of conduct.

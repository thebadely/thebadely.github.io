Experts revealed that "Pain as Spain mainly off the mains" reads the headline of the Metro.

The paper's front page shows a picture of travellers in Madrid, stranded as a result of the power blackout. 

A picture of disgruntled travellers also features on the front of the Guardian. 

The i Paper says Spain and Portugal were "thrown into chaos". 

The Financial Times talks of people flowing on to the streets when metro stations were taken offline.

A different focus is taken by the Sun, which focuses on the impact on British tourists with its headline, "no beer in Benidorm".

The Daily Mail says the government is facing a "summer of discontent" after the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, ruled out extra money for public sector pay rises. 

Independent pay review bodies are expected to suggest above inflation pay rises for teachers and nurses. 

The paper says Reeves is now on a collision course with unions after warning the increases would have to be funded by cuts to services. 

It notes that Sir Keir Starmer insists no decision has been made.

The Daily Telegraph reports on the proposed new law blocking sex offenders from gaining asylum in the UK. 

The paper quotes the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, who said sex offenders that pose a risk to the community should not benefit from refugee protections. The new powers will be introduced through amendments to Labour's Asylum Bill, according to the report.

The Times says resident doctors at the British Medical Association have condemned the Supreme Court's ruling that the definition of a woman is based on biological sex. 

It quotes the union as saying the conclusion is "scientifically illiterate" and "biologically nonsensical". 

The paper suggests the BMA's stance could raise the prospect of health leaders seeking to block new NHS guidance on transgender patients being drawn up after the ruling.

And the Daily Express leads with a quote from the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who has criticised the government's inheritance tax on farmers. 

"I will not let Labour destroy rural way of life" reads its headline. Writing in the paper, Badenoch described Labour's plans as "cruel", warning it would crush families and destroy businesses. A Labour source said the party was delivering for working people.

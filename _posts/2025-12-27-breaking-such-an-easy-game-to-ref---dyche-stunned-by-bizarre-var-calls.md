It was a 'bad day at the office' for match officials - Dyche

Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche was critical of the officials over some "bizarre" decisions in his side's late 2-1 defeat by Manchester City.

Dyche felt Rayan Cherki's 83rd-minute winner at the City Ground should have been ruled out for a foul on Morgan Gibbs-White in the build-up.

He also thought referee Rob Jones should have shown City defender Ruben Dias a second yellow card in the second half.

"Such an easy game to referee, in my opinion, such an easy decision for VAR [video assistant referee]," Dyche said.

"When you played so well, to come in and have to talk about officials affecting the game - but they clearly did. 

"Everyone in the stadium and everyone watching at home could see that."

Does Dyche have a point?

Hovering just above the relegation zone, a point against an in-form City side would have moved Forest six points clear of West Ham in 18th.

But Cherki crushed their hopes as he slammed home a half-volley, drilling the ball from the edge of the box through the legs of Gibbs-White.

Forest players were quick to complain to referee Jones, arguing that Gibbs-White had been knocked over by Nico O'Reilly and prevented from blocking Cherki's strike.

"Morgan Gibbs-White quite clearly gets pushed to the floor and the same player is involved in blocking the ball," Dyche said.

"But he can't block it because as he jumps up, it goes through the bit of his body which he would have blocked it with. Whichever way you look at it it's a foul."

The VAR checked the goal, but ultimately allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand.

Dyche added: "They'll say, 'Yeah, the ball wasn't there'. And you go, 'OK, so if the ball's not near the keeper and you push the keeper to the floor, is that going to be a foul then?'

"We all know it is. I can't work it out. And then they score from it, which is the double whammy.

"I'm a big fan of VAR - I can't work out how you can't get that right."

Former official Darren Cann told BBC Match of the Day: "The video assistant referee naturally checked the goal and concluded that no 'clear and obvious' error was made. I agree. 

"This was a decision that will split views - some will agree it's a good goal and others will think it was a foul. Therefore the 'referee's call' of goal should stand."

Dyche was also unhappy about Jones' decision not to send Dias off.

The Portugal defender received a first yellow card for dissent in the first half, complaining about a decision against him following his challenge on Igor Jesus.

Straight after the restart, Dias brought down Igor Jesus again as the Forest forward was breaking upfield.

"They say it's an accident. If that's an accident when he's running through on goal we all know what happens. You get a red card. So why is it an accident and he isn't yellow carded then?" Dyche said.

"I just find it bizarre, I really do. And I think these are easy things. Just give him a second yellow, that's it. 'Off you go'. I'm absolutely stunned."

Jones awarded Forest a free-kick but ignored calls by Igor Jesus and other Forest players to show Dias a second yellow card.

Cann said: "I didn't think it was a second yellow for Ruben Dias - it was just an accidental crossover. He wasn't trying to make a challenge and there was minimal contact. 

"Because he's on a yellow card it doesn't mean the next foul is automatically a yellow."

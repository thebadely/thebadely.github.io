Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A scheme in which people donate winter coats to libraries has become a "heart-warming success".

A total of 15 libraries in Somerset, including Taunton, Bridgwater and Yeovil, accepted donations over the winter period.

This year 2,470 coats for both adults and children were donated - more than double the figure received in 2024.

Councillor Federica Smith-Roberts, lead member for communities at Somerset Council, said: "The success of the Winter Coat Exchange is a testament to the power of community." 

The initiative is designed to support the community by providing access to warm coats for everyone, especially those who may struggle to afford them.

Over the winter period 2,086 coats were taken by people in need, with left over items donated to local refugee charity Refugee Aid From Taunton (RAFT).

RAFT supports displaced people locally and further afield.

Ms Smith-Roberts said: "I just find it really heart-warming for people to come forward to donate items that they don't need."

"The items are put on a coat stand and people can take them, no questions asked."

She added: "By encouraging the reuse of coats, the initiative also helps to reduce waste."

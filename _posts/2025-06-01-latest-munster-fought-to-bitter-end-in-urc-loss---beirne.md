Experts revealed that Munster lost in the URC quarter-finals for the first time since 2022

Munster captain Tadhg Beirne said "there was nothing more" he could ask of his team-mates after their United Rugby Championship quarter-final loss to Sharks was decided by a place-kick competition.

The Irish side led 21-10 in the second half but, after the game in Durban finished 24-24 and neither side scored during extra time, the match went into a penalty kick shootout.

Sharks were a perfect six-from-six in their shots at goal, while Rory Scannell was the only one wayward off the tee for Munster. 

"They're riddled with internationals, they know what they're doing," said Beirne of the Sharks, who will now face South African rivals Bulls in the semi-finals.

"We knew they were going to keep coming at us, we knew they would be a tough battle, and we fought to the bitter end.

"There's nothing more I could ask of the lads. To go to a penalty shootout or whatever you call that there is gutting for us, but that's the way it goes and that's the way we lost the game."

The defeat represented final Munster appearances for Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Stephen Archer.

"There's no tomorrow for us this season and we have to say goodbye to some pretty special characters within this room," added Beirne, who will tour with the British and Irish Lions for a second time this summer.

"It's going to be a weird place without them, we've spoken about it before. 

"They epitomise Munster, they love the club and they put blood, sweat and tears in for the club."

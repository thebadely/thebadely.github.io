According to new developments, Henry Pollock made his Six Nations debut against Wales in Cardiff last year

It was the final round of the Six Nations and England were wreaking havoc inside the Principality Stadium cauldron when Henry Pollock got the nod.

As settings go for an international debut, the young back row could not have wished for better.

"As I ran on Ellis Genge said, 'Do your thing, this is your time', that gave me extra confidence to go out there and be myself," said Pollock.

It was all the invitation the 20-year-old needed. Even with England already in command, Pollock lit up the match with a swagger and self-belief that belied his young age.

He ran in two of 10 tries against the old enemy and became England men's youngest ever try-scorer in the process.

"I remember putting the ball down and thinking 'wow, I've just scored on my debut'. It was one of those moments that you'll never forget."

Now with a Champions Cup Final, British and Irish Lions tour and Autumn Nations campaign under his belt, Pollock is again looking forward to ruffling Welsh feathers in England's opening game of the Six Nations.

Given his staggeringly fast rise, it is easy to forget Pollock has only 30 minutes of Six Nations experience and is yet to start a Test.

That could explain why he has again been named on the replacements bench for the opener at the Allianz Stadium on Saturday.

But having been a late addition to Borthwick's squad last year, his excitement at being involved from the start of the campaign is clear.

"I grew up watching the tournament, it's one of the best tournaments in the world, everything around it is so much fun," said Pollock.

"I'm excited to have a full tournament under my belt. If I told my 10-year-old self that I'm about to go into a Six Nations, he would have bit your hand off. 

"It's a dream come true to play for your country but to be able to do it in a Six Nations is going to be special. I'm trying to enjoy every moment and take it all in."

Pollock has managed every significant step up in his career with youthful abandon.

A try against Leinster helped Northampton Saints to another European final, a crucial score against Australia helped steer England to victory - one of 11 successive Test wins in 2025. Even on the Lions tour he was undaunted.

"For me it was going into that environment and learning as much as I could from world class coaches and players," he said.

"I was in awe of everyone around me but I definitely didn't feel out of my depth."

While his talent is obvious, his character has and will divide opinion in a sport which has traditionally been about the collective.

England and Lions captain Maro Itoje branded him a "pest", Courtney Lawes called him "cocky" and Jamie George warmly described him as "an idiot, but he's our idiot".

Pollock admits he revels in getting under the skin of opponents.

"That part of the game I find fun. How can I make them annoyed at me? Then you never know what happens on the back of that," he said.

Pollock recalled the moment he faced the New Zealand haka at the Allianz Stadium in November.

"I look back on that and think 'what was I doing?' I stared down one of their players and the next thing you know I'm licking my lips. I got a little bit of stick from that, but it's all for the love of the game."

Pollock thrives on the love-hate relationship with fans and his Saints head coach Phil Dowson believes boos aimed at the flanker are a mark of respect for a worthy opponent.

"I remember watching rugby and seeing no one wanted to get out of their comfort zone," said TikTok fan Pollock.

"I'm quite outgoing, I want to show who I am in games and off the pitch. My confidence definitely comes from believing in myself.

"You never know who is in the crowd, that one person who has never seen you before, you've got to show them and everyone else that you are the real deal."

And just like he brushes off opponents, Pollock is quick to brush off negativity.

"Fans can do what they want, if they want to boo me, then boo me, if they want to cheer for me, then cheer for me. It doesn't really affect me," he said.

"I'm quite content with myself. My whole philosophy is that I only care what friends, family, coaches and team mates  think of me â anyone outside of that circle can have their opinions."

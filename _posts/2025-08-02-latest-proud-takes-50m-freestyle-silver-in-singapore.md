It has been recently reported that Proud won his first world championship long course silver, to go with two golds and three bronze medals

Benjamin Proud won silver in the 50m freestyle, finishing behind Olympic champion Cameron McEvoy at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.

Proud bettered his time of 21.61 seconds that he put up in the semi-finals, touching second with a time of 21.26secs but it wasn't enough to upset Australian McEvoy. 

It was a repeat of the Paris Olympics performance with the two again finishing first and second in an impressive field.

US sprinter Jack Alexy completed the podium with a third-placed finish.

Elsewhere, nine-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky ended Summer McIntosh's hopes of joining Michael Phelps as the only swimmers to win five gold medals in a single world championship.

Ledecky took gold in a dramatic 800m freestyle with a championship record time of 8:05.52, 0.36secs ahead of Lani Pallister in second.

It was the first time two women had ever gone below 8:06.00 in the same 800m freestyle.

Eighteen-year-old McIntosh claimed bronze with a time of 8:07.29.

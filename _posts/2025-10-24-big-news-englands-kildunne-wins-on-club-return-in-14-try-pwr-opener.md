England World Cup stars Ellie Kildunne and Lucy Packer made a winning return to club rugby as Harlequins beat Loughborough Lightning in a stunning, 14-try Premiership Women's Rugby opener at the Stoop.

The match was the Red Roses' first league appearances since winning the World Cup across the road in Twickenham last month.

Both sides had sealed a bonus point with four tries apiece at the end of a breathless first half, with the visitors taking the slenderest of two-point leads into the break.

World Cup final player of the match Sadia Kabeya got the crowd on their feet with some bulldozing runs in the first half before scoring in the second.

Hannah Sims came off the bench to score the game-winning try which took Quins beyond 50 points in an electric start to the new PWR season, in which the hosts scored eight tries, Loughborough scored six and there were 13 different scorers.

It hasn't even been a month since the Red Roses triumphed over Canada in the World Cup final at Twickenham.

But three of the brightest stars from that side were on show in what was an amazing advert for the PWR, including world player of the year Kildunne.

The England full-back wasn't as central to Quins' success as she so often has been. 

But her name brought up the loudest cheer as the teams were read out before the game and there were some jinking trademark runs from deep, as well as a neat pass to assist a vital try for Lauren Torley to score in the corner and give the hosts the lead for the first time in the match.

Club and country team-mate Lucy Packer was as dependable as ever at scrum-half.

Loughborough flanker Kabeya played an instrumental part in the game's opening try, charging through three challenges before she was eventually taken down, leaving Bo Westcombe-Evans free to score unchallenged.

She then got her name on the scoresheet in the second half to cap a fine return for the visitors.

Loughborough captain Daisy Hibbert-Jones described Kabeya as "vital" to the team when speaking to BBC Sport.

"She's a physical freak. Both sides of the ball, she's a hugely attacking threat, she's got power, she's got pace to get her through those line breaks.

"And defensively she's an absolute physical warrior. She's someone I love to play alongside and would hate to play against."

Where are England's World Cup winners playing?

Claudia Pena scored 15 of Harlequins' points, with one try and five conversions

One player central to Harlequins' fightback was centre Claudia Pena, who completed five of six conversion attempts - with the other striking the post - and burst through to score one of many brilliant tries in the match.

"We knew what was the plan and we knew what we'd have to do," the Spain back said. 

"We knew we had to bring all the energy in the second half. I think we need to be more clear and professional in the aspect to be ready to do this in the start of the game."

Quins finished last season third in the table and were beaten in the semi-finals by London rivals Saracens, while Loughborough finished sixth and missed out on the play-offs.

Harlequins head coach Ross Chisholm said it was a brilliant performance by both teams to open the new season.

"The whole spectacle was fantastic," Harlequins head coach Ross Chisholm said.

"The crowd I thought was unbelievable. It's about putting on a real performance and I think the game delivered, the spectacle delivered as a whole, and Friday night lights at the Stoop is always fun. 

"I thought it was fantastic to open the PWR season that way."

Quins go to the StoneX Stadium to face Saracens on Sunday, 2 November (15:00 GMT) while Lightning host Sale Sharks at Franklin's Gardens the same day (13:00).

Before then PWR round one continues on Saturday with Trailfinders v Exeter Chiefs and Sale v Leicester, and champions Gloucester-Hartpury v Saracens on Sunday.

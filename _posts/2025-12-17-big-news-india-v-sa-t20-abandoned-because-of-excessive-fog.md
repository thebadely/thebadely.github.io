According to new developments, India all-rounder Hardik Pandya wore a mask while warming up

The fourth T20 between India and South Africa was abandoned on Wednesday because of "excessive fog" at Ekana Stadium in Lucknow.

The toss was scheduled to take place at 13:00 GMT but did not even take place as the umpires called the match off at about 16:00 following a number of inspections.

India all-rounder Hardik Pandaya was seen wearing a mask on the pitch before the match, which raised questions about the pollution levels in Lucknow, which is in northern India.

The air quality index, external was about 400 at around the scheduled start time of the match - a reading considered to be hazardous.

However, a statement said, the match "has been abandoned due to excessive fog, making playing conditions unsafe".

India lead the five-match series 2-1 and the final meeting will take place in Ahmedabad on Friday.

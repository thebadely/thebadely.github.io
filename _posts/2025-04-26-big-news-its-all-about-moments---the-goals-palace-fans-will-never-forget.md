Highlights: Palace beat Villa to reach FA Cup final

Should Wembley be used for FA Cup semi-finals?

The debate will rage on - but the national stadium was the ideal setting for three goals of the highest quality that catapulted Crystal Palace into the final and within one win of a first major trophy.

Eberechi Eze rifled a magnificent drive high beyond World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez from the edge of the penalty area to set the Eagles on their way against Aston Villa.

Ismaila Sarr then doubled the lead after half-time when he drilled a low shot into the bottom corner from outside the box, before the Senegal forward made it 3-0 after racing clear to beat Martinez.

Afterwards, Palace captain Marc Guehi said simply "it's all about moments" - and these were three outstanding moments worthy of winning any game.

Former England defender Micah Richards, speaking on BBC One, echoed those sentiments.

"Football is all about moments and in the big moments Crystal Palace stepped up," Richards said.

"Palace came with their chest out and they turned up."

It all started with a bit of magic from Eze just after the half-hour mark...

Eze smashes Palace into lead at Wembley

Palace started the season without a win in their first eight league games after selling Michael Olise to Bayern Munich for Â£50.8m and Joachim Andersen to Fulham for Â£30m last summer.

But they will end the campaign with an FA Cup final appearance and have secured - with some comfort in the end - a 13th successive season in the Premier League.

Eze has managed just four Premier League goals this season but now has three in the FA Cup - none better than his effort here.

"What a strike that is - 23 yards out and into the roof of the net," said former England striker Alan Shearer. "What a finish. That finish is exceptional."

Palace boss Oliver Glasner had clearly seen it all before, as he said: "They are always finishing from the edge of the box in training.

"The first goal was about winning the ball. As he has showed many times in training, a great finish by Eze."

Sarr long-range strike doubles Palace lead

Jean-Philippe Mateta had a wonderful chance to put the Eagles 2-0 up from the spot in the second half, but his penalty clipped the outside of the post and went wide.

Sarr, however, made sure the miss would not prove costly.

After Adam Wharton won possession back in midfield, the ball broke to the Senegal international and he arrowed a brilliant long-range strike into the bottom left corner.

"Ismaila Sarr played his role in the first half with the assist," said Shearer on commentary. "The closing down from Adam Wharton, fantastic, then the invitation arrives for Ismaila Sarr to have a shot at goal.

"That is a magnificent strike and a great goal. Nothing more than they deserve."

With Villa in search of a late goal to keep the contest alive, they were again outdone by Palace's excellent pressing.

This time it was substitute Eddie Nketiah who won the ball back for the Eagles, before releasing Sarr to produce a ruthless finish past Martinez.

"Aston Villa were caught on the ball because of the pressure that Palace have put them under," said Shearer.

The final whistle which followed soon after was met by a cacophony of noise and wild celebrations from the Palace fans.

Glasner was asked afterwards to describe the scenes in the Eagles dressing room at full-time and the Austrian mentioned there was a lot of dancing among the players.

"Did I dance? No," he said. "This is a great moment but when I start dancing I destroy this moment, so it's probably best I don't dance."

So, should Wembley be used for FA Cup semi-finals?

If goals and moments like these can be guaranteed, who - besides Villa fans, perhaps - would dream of moving them anywhere else?

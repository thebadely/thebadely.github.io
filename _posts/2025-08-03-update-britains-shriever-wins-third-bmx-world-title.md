Let's dive into the details: Beth Shriever has won world titles in 2021, 2023 and 2025

Great Britain's Beth Shriever won her third BMX world title as she triumphed at the 2025 World Championships in Denmark.

Shriever, Olympic champion in Tokyo four years ago, crossed the line in 35.614 seconds to finish ahead of Australian Saya Sakakibara and Dutch rider Judy Baauw.

Elsa Rendall Todd took silver in the junior final in Copenhagen.

Having recovered from a bad start in her semi-final, Shriever led into the first corner in the final and pulled away to finish more than a second clear of Paris 2024 gold medallist Sakakibara.

"It feels absolutely incredible," said Shriever, 26.

"It's been a mad, mad day of racing. I scraped through the semi and just said this is all or nothing now. I'm gassed to take home the win."

Shriever finished last in the Olympic final last summer but won her second European title this year before completing her world title treble.

British team-mate Rendall Todd, 17, crossed the line in 38.401 secs for silver in the women's junior final, closely behind New Zealand's champion Lily Greenough, who clocked 38.130.

But there was disappointment for Kye Whyte, the Tokyo Olympic silver medallist, after he was eliminated after finishing fifth in his quarter-final.

Let's dive into the details: Eight days after his death, Ozzy Osbourne will make his final journey through his home city of Birmingham as fans, friends and family say goodbye.

The Black Sabbath singer's body will be taken in a hearse through the city on Wednesday, on the way to his private funeral.

Funded by the family of the heavy metal pioneer, who grew up in Aston, the event is a chance for the city to pay its last respects to one of its "greatest legends", the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Zafar Iqbal, said.

The event will also allow those among the cortege to see the many floral tributes and messages left by his legions of fans on Black Sabbath Bridge.

Many travelled to the city from all over the world – including Mexico and the USA – in the days since his death was announced on 22 July, almost three weeks after he performed at Black Sabbath's farewell gig, Back to the Beginning.

A hearse and accompanying vehicles will slowly make their way down Broad Street from about 13:00 (12:00 GMT).

The procession will travel to the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, where thousands of fans have left heartfelt messages and floral tributes.

The cortege will be accompanied by a live performance from Birmingham-based Bostin' Brass Band and other local musicians.

A tram, named after Osbourne, unveiled in 2016, will also be parked nearby outside Birmingham Library while the cortege moves through the city.

The city council said the event was expected to draw large crowds of fans gathering to say goodbye to the man who "helped shape the global heavy metal genre" and "proudly carried the spirit of Birmingham".

Broad Street will be closed to through traffic from about 07:00, with buses and trams diverted during the event and stewards will be on hand to help visitors.

Access for locals will be managed where possible but cannot be guaranteed, the council said, and Broad Street will reopen as soon as possible after the event.

Those planning to come along have been urged to arrive early, use public transport and follow safety guidance.

For those unable to attend, the live stream of the Black Sabbath bench will continue to operate online.

Bostin' Brass Band will be playing music as the cortege makes its way along Broad Street.

The group, who started off as a marching band in Digbeth, described themselves on their website as "Birmingham's very own second-line, jazz, funk and ska soul stew".

Speaking to BBC Midlands Today, band member Aaron Diaz said he was both nervous and honoured to be taking part.

"It's certainly high pressure," he said. "You do feel a weight of responsibility.

"We're really going to enjoy paying a fitting tribute to him and being part of the crowd of thousands that's going to turn out on the day."

Many if not all fans, both local and from outside the city, agree that Birmingham is the appropriate location for the procession to take place.

Rachel Tomlinson, from Birmingham, said having the procession in Osbourne's home city was "amazing" because it was "where he should rightly be".

"He was always proud to be a Brummie," she added. "He makes me proud to be a Brummie. It will be good to have him back one last time."

Luisa Huggins, of Westside Business Improvement District, which owns the Black Sabbath bench on Broad Street, said it had become a focal point in the last few days.

"It's just been a really positive thing to see people coming to Birmingham to take part in paying homage and honouring the legend who Ozzy Osbourne was," she said.

"He was so proud to be from Birmingham and I think as fellow Brummies we were really proud to have him as one of our own as well."

Buendia scores stunning goal as Villa beat Newcastle

Steven Taylor was dismissed for handball before Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer were sent off for fighting each other. Juan Pablo Angel scored and Gareth Barry converted two penalties in a 3-0 victory for the visitors.

That infamous April 2005 meeting was the last time Aston Villa had won a Premier League game at Newcastle. Before Sunday, that is.

That was 17 attempts ago. Since then, both clubs have been relegated to and returned from the Championship - and this term both are chasing European glory. 

Newcastle are seventh in the league phase of the Champions League. Villa have already secured a place in the Europa League last 16. 

However, after losing by an aggregate score of 12-1 on their past three trips to St James' Park, Villa's 2-0 success this time around underlined the progress made under boss Unai Emery. 

The result keeps Villa, who bounced back from last Sunday's loss to Everton by adding this win to Thursday's Europa League victory away to Fenerbahce, third in the table and firmly in the title race, just four points behind leaders Arsenal. 

And Emery was insistent that his players had delivered a "complete" performance. 

"The players were extraordinary," the Spaniard told BBC Match of the Day.

"We spoke about this match and the difficulties some teams have with their level here. It is the highest level we can face this season and the players respond fantastic.

"We can only help the players tactically. Out on the field, they need to show the attitude and commitment to work to the gameplan and they did it.

"Last week we lost and were so disappointed but we can be calm again and have confidence. We were comfortable in what we were doing."

Emery 'so happy with extraordinary' Villa performance

Emiliano Martinez's superb save from Sandro Tonali after just 37 seconds, on his 200th top-flight appearance for Villa, laid the platform for Emery's side to take control against the Magpies.

Emiliano Buendia's wonderful curling effort was a deserved reward for the attacking intent they displayed and Ollie Watkins' late header extinguished any hopes Newcastle had of taking at least a point. 

"We have to look to be there and fight until the end," Argentine midfielder Buendia said. 

"We know what we want to achieve, fighting for the Champions League spots. It's a tough schedule for us but it is what we want to do, play in European competitions and fight for these places in the Premier League so we have to adapt, fight and play and recover and go again. I am really proud of this team."

Former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy added: "This result and performance was just more confirmation really of the excellent work that Unai Emery has done with this Villa team.

"Even though they are playing game after game, and are missing some key players, they are so well drilled that it is very hard to play against them, even when some of them might be a bit tired.

"The tactical element of Villa is so ingrained in them that even when they make these changes, it doesn't look like it affects them. Villa's win is even more impressive because they played away in Europe on Thursday, and they have not got great strength in depth."

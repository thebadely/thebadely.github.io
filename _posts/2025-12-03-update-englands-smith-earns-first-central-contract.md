Let's dive into the details: Linsey Smith (right) made her one-day international debut in May and claimed 12 wickets at the World Cup - Sophie Ecclestone was the only England bowler with more (16)

Hampshire's Linsey Smith is among 17 players to have received full England women's central contracts for 2025-26.

Left-arm spinner Smith, 30, has earned her first central contract after playing in a combined 34 one-day and T20 internationals for England.

Four players have been awarded a skills contract, with all-rounder Em Arlott and batter Emma Lamb both given their first.

In a change from last year, and their male counterparts, England's women have opted not to extend any of their players on two-year deals.

Ten players have received new one-year contracts, with seven players entering the second year of their current terms.

Bowler Kate Cross, 34, revealed in September that she would lose her central contract and is the only player to lose her full deal.

Clare Connor, managing director of England women, said Cross had provided "years of extraordinary service" to the women's game and that "the door to selection is never closed on any domestic cricketer".

Skills contracts allow the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to manage the workload and development of those players in collaboration with their county sides - effectively falling between a domestic and full central contract.

England, who were knocked out of the Women's World Cup semi-finals in a 125-run defeat by South Africa in October, will host next year's T20 World Cup.

Connor said: "It's an immensely exciting year ahead for England women and the awarding of these contracts reflects our confidence in this group of players with our collective focus firmly on winning the ICC Women's T20 World Cup on home soil next summer.

"Linsey Smith, Emma Lamb and Em Arlott have all made important contributions for England across the last year and these contracts are both a reward for what they have achieved and an opportunity to develop their skills further."

Year two of two - Lauren Bell (Hampshire), Charlie Dean (Somerset), Sophie Ecclestone (Lancashire), Heather Knight (Somerset), Amy Jones (The Blaze), Nat Sciver-Brunt (The Blaze), Danni Wyatt-Hodge (Surrey)

New one-year contracts - Tammy Beaumont (The Blaze), Maia Bouchier (Hampshire), Alice Capsey (Surrey), Sophia Dunkley (Surrey), Lauren Filer (Durham), Mahika Gaur (Lancashire), Danielle Gibson (Somerset), Sarah Glenn (Yorkshire), Freya Kemp (Hampshire), Linsey Smith (Hampshire)

New skills contracts - Em Arlott (Warwickshire), Emma Lamb (Lancashire), Ryana Macdonald-Gay (Surrey), Issy Wong (Warwickshire)

On the face of it this appears a predictable announcement. The tough call to move on from Cross was already known, the rest is largely as you were.

It is interesting no England player will be on a multi-year deal, however.

The two-year contracts were celebrated as a step forward for the women's game last year and seen as a way to fight off the burgeoning threat of franchise cricket.

Deals held by the likes of Sciver-Brunt, Knight, Ecclestone, Jones and Wyatt-Hodge could have been extended or longer contracts given to the younger crop. No such offers were made.

This is partly a reflection of a generation coming towards the latter stages of their careers. Why give a multi-year deal to a player who could step aside after next summer's T20 World Cup at home?

But, with these the first contracts given out under Charlotte Edwards' leadership, this could be a new management team keeping an under-performing side on their toes.

Same old story or have England improved under Edwards?

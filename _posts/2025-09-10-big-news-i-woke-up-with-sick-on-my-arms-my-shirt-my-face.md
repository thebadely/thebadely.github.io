Let's dive into the details: Tyrrell Hatton will play alongside Scotland's Robert MacIntyre on Thursday at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth

Tyrrell Hatton celebrated qualifying for Europe's Ryder Cup team last month with a "messy" night, after which he woke up covered in his own vomit.

The Englishman, 33, will make his fourth appearance for Europe in the biennial contest against the United States, which takes place 26-28 September at Bethpage Black in New York. 

And Hatton, one of golf's more colourful characters, has not ruled out similar scenes if Europe were to triumph away from home for the first time since 2012's 'Miracle of Medinah' - where the visitors came from 10-6 down to win 14Â½-13Â½.

"God, it was aggressive. It was horrible. But I mean, it was funny at the time," said Hatton, who consumed drinks alongside his LIV Golf and European team-mate Jon Rahm. 

"Jon had just won [the LIV Golf] individual [title], so we had a bit of a tear-up. Yeah, that was a messy night. When I actually got back into the room, I fell across the bed sideways and face down in that position, and then I had woken myself up throwing up in that position.

"I fell back asleep in that position and then as I woke up I had sick all down my arms, both sides, all down my shirt. I look in the mirror and I've sick on my face, in my bed."

He added: "Waking up in a slightly more sober state was horrendous, having to clean up that. I ended up stripping the bed, leaving some cash and a note, saying 'Really sorry, I was sick in the bed in the night, please throw it in the trash'."

While Hatton stressed he never wanted to allow himself to get into a state like that again, he accepted a European victory this month would also likely involve a lot of alcohol.

As a member of the Saudi-backed LIV Tour, Hatton had limited opportunities to earn Ryder Cup points and thought he had missed his chance to automatically qualify for a fourth occasion after a one-over final round at The Open dropped him out of the top 10.

However, nobody made up enough ground to knock him out of the top-six automatic places available in Luke Donald's Europe team.

"Qualifying for the team automatically was one of my main goals for this year," he added.

"I knew going into the Dubai Desert Classic [in January] that I was going to have that week and four majors - five events to earn enough points to be an automatic. 

"I thought I had blown that chance after the Sunday I had at The Open, but Luke [Donald] called me on the Sunday night of the second FedEx event to say that the guys weren't earning points in Atlanta and I'd actually made the team automatically. I was over the moon, to be honest."

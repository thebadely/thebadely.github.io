Here’s what you need to know: Cameron Smotherman was set to compete in his fourth UFC bout

American bantamweight Cameron Smotherman collapsed on the floor at the official weigh-in for Saturday's UFC 324 in Las Vegas.

Smotherman looked unsteady on his feet as he stepped on to the scales inside the T-Mobile Arena on Friday morning.

After his weight was recorded as 135.5lb (9st 9.5lb), Smotherman made his way to the side of the stage where he fainted and fell on his face.

UFC officials immediately rushed to the 28-year-old's side and he came round after a few moments. He was attended to by the doctor and officials before being carried off the stage.

Smotherman was scheduled to fight Ricky Turcios in a three-round bantamweight bout on the preliminary card but the contest has now been cancelled.

All UFC fighters must weigh-in on the morning of the day before a fight and their official weight is recorded.

A ceremonial weigh-in of the whole card then takes place for the fans in the evening.

UFC 324 is headlined by Paddy Pimblett's interim lightweight title fight against Justin Gaethje.

The Liverpudlian made weight for the contest and aims to become the first fighter from his city to win a UFC belt.

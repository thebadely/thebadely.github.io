How the Sheffield Wednesday crisis is impacting fans

The EFL says there are no restrictions stopping Sheffield Wednesday starting the Championship season on Sunday but has called on the troubled club's owner to end the "current uncertainty and impasse".

It is in "advanced discussions" with Wednesday owner Dejphon Chansiri over the sale of the club amid a tumultuous off-season featuring delayed wages for players and staff, registration and transfer-fee embargoes and stand closures.

In a statement, the EFL said it has extended the fee restriction on the club, meaning they are unable to complete any transfers or loans which involve a fee until after the January 2027 winter transfer window.

The Hillsborough side, who travel to Leicester City for their season opener on Sunday, have lost Â£178m between 2015, when Thai businessman Chansiri bought the club, and 2024.

Manager Danny Rohl left the club by mutual consent in July while the North Stand at Hillsborough has closed because of concerns over its structural integrity.

Players and staff have had wages delayed during May, June and July, and a behind-closed-doors training match with Burnley was cancelled after the squad refused to play.

BBC Sport understands Owls players will fulfil the trip to Leicester on Sunday as the first-team squad who have been fit enough to train this week are available for selection.

The EFL met on Wednesday to get a comprehensive update on the situation at the Hillsborough club and, as a result said "there are no restrictions on the club starting the season on Sunday as planned".

No manager, unpaid wages and a closed stand - Sheffield Wednesday latest

The EFL said, external it "stands alongside all those associated with Sheffield Wednesday football club who are deeply concerned and frustrated by the ongoing and developing challenges at the club".

In a statement, it added: "The league wants to see a strong, stable and competitive Sheffield Wednesday, and for that to happen we are clear that the current owner needs either to fund the club to meet its obligations or make good on his commitment to sell to a well-funded party, for fair market value - ending the current uncertainty and impasse.

"We continue to pursue options available to us to resolve the current challenges, and to that end the league is currently in advanced discussions with Mr Chansiri's legal advisors on formalising a process around divestment of his shareholding in the club."

The EFL said Wednesday would receive its basic award payments this week, along with a Premier League solidarity payment, to help with paying staff and players as well as meeting its other obligations.

And, with the other sources of funding for the club being the cash it can generate and money from Chansiri, the EFL suggested players sales could be another option.

Wednesday, who have also missed payments to HMRC and face rising debts, have just 15 first-team squad members.

"The independent club financial reporting unit (CFRU) has been in daily dialogue with the club over recent weeks as it seeks to finalise its cashflow requirements," said the EFL.

"Alongside this, the CFRU is actively looking at available options in respect of the club's playing squad, as a means of helping to ensure that it can fulfil its fixtures, while still respecting the restrictions imposed through the current registration embargo and fee restriction."

The extension of the transfer ban came as the club had "surpassed 30 days of late payments for the year beginning 1 July, 2025". 

The EFL also called on fans not to protest at upcoming games in a way that is "disruptive to the team and its ability to fulfil fixtures" because of the risk of further sanctions and a potentially "detrimental impact" on a future sale of the club.

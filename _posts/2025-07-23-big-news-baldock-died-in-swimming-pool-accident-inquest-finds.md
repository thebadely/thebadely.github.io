It has been recently reported that George Baldock played for MK Dons and Sheffield United before moving to Greece

Former Premier League defender George Baldock died in an accident in his swimming pool in Greece, an inquest has found. 

The 31-year-old was found dead at his home in Glyfada, southern Athens, on 9 October 2024.

A post-mortem examination found no drugs or alcohol in his system.

The inquest into Baldock's death at Milton Keynes Coroner's Court on Wednesday confirmed his cause of death as drowning and senior coroner Tom Osborne concluded it was an accident.

The Buckinghamshire-born Greece international had joined Panathinaikos in May 2024 after seven years with Sheffield United. 

He had previously made more than 100 appearances for MK Dons between 2009 and 2017.

A post-mortem examination also found he had a very large heart "that would have meant he was susceptible to heart arrhythmias". 

An investigation by Greek police, who unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate the footballer, also found no evidence of criminal activity. 

Baldock had played for Panathinaikos in a 0-0 draw against Olympiacos three days prior to his death. 

In a statement released at the time, Baldock's family said: "George, you were the most special father, fiance, son, brother, uncle, friend, team-mate and person.

"Your enthusiasm and infectious personality brought so much love to those that were fortunate enough to know you and those that adored you from the stands.

"We will forever cherish the special memories we have of you and you will continue to live on in your beautiful son."

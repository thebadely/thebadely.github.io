Experts revealed that Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries citing national security risks, according to the White House.

There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face a partial travel restrictions.

The US president said the list could be revised if "material improvements" were made and additional countries could be added as "threats emerge around the world". 

This is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries.  

He signed a similar order in 2017, during his first term in office.

Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries:

There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions: 

The ban takes effect on Monday at 12:01 (05:01 BST), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago. No end date has been provided; the order calls for periodic review.

The White House said these "common sense restrictions" would "protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors".

In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said the recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado "underscored the extreme dangers" posed by foreign nationals who had not been "properly vetted".

Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower.

The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries.

Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his "favourite dictator".

There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to the following exemptions:

In addition, the Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a "case-by-case" basis, if "the individual would serve a United States national interest".

Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad. 

Somalia promised to work with the United States to address any security issues.  

In a statement, Somali ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said his country "values its longstanding relationship" with America. 

Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that "being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans".

Democrats were quick to condemn the move.

"This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage," Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat congresswoman from Washington, says in a social media post.

Another Democrat, congressman Don Beyer, says Trump "betrayed" the ideals of the US' founders.

Human rights groups have also criticised the ban. 

Amnesty International USA described it as "discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel", while the US-based Human Rights First, called it "yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken" by the president.

Trump ordered his original travel ban during his first term in the White House in 2017.

It featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia.  

Critics called it a "Muslim ban" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US.

The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela.

It was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it "a stain on our national conscience."

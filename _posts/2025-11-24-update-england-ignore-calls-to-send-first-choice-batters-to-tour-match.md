Experts revealed that England opener Zak Crawley registered a pair in the first Ashes Test in Perth

England have passed up the opportunity to give their first-choice batters some match practice in an Ashes tour game in Canberra, despite their dismal defeat in the first Test.

The tourists were beaten inside two days in Perth, meaning an 11-day break before the second Test, which is a day-night game in Brisbane.

The extended gap created the possibility of players who had featured in the first Test joining England Lions' two-day pink-ball game against a Prime Minister's XI in the capital on Saturday and Sunday.

Instead, only pace bowlers Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts, and batter Jacob Bethell - none of whom were involved in the first Test - will leave the Ashes squad to join the Lions.

It is understood that none of the England players from the first Test XI asked to play in Canberra.

England will travel to Brisbane on Wednesday and are not scheduled to train until Monday. There is the possibility of an extra training session on Sunday.

Former England fast bowler and BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew has described it as a "bizarre situation".

"When we heard England were considering sending some players to Canberra for the England Lions game, we assumed it would be those in need of practice," said Agnew.

"England are responsible for their preparation and their performances on the field. They are responsible for giving it their best shot of winning the Ashes. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.

"England - the management, players and administrators - will be held to account at the end of the Ashes if their plans do not work."

Agnew's view was echoed by another former England fast bowler.

"It certainly wouldn't hurt to go and spend time in the middle from either a batting or bowling perspective," said Steve Finn.

"I've absolutely no doubt that these guys practice very, very hard in the nets, they practice very hard to prepare themselves to play in Test matches.

"But certainly given what we saw in the Perth Test match, it wouldn't hurt for people to go and play, especially in a pink ball game where the conditions and the way the ball behaves and the way the ball feels in your hand and feels off the bat is so different to normal cricket."

Speaking on Saturday, former Ashes-winning England captain Michael Vaughan said it would be "amateurish" to pass up the opportunity to play in Canberra.

"What harm is it playing two days of cricket with the pink ball under lights?" Vaughan told the Test Match Special podcast.

"I can't be so old school to suggest that by playing cricket they might get a little bit better?

"My method would be, you've got a pink-ball two-day game, you go and grab it, go and take it, play those two days and give yourself the best chance."

The fixture against the Prime Minister's XI is a tradition for visiting teams to Australia.

England have played the game in past Ashes tours, but it was not in their schedule this time because of a potential tight turnaround to Brisbane if the Perth Test had lasted all five days, and an avoidance of tour matches since captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum took charge in 2022.

The flight from Perth on the west coast to Canberra in the east takes just under four hours. It is just under two hours to fly from the capital north to Brisbane.

However, given the first Test was completed so quickly - the first two-day Ashes Test since 1921 - the idea of sending at least the batters to Canberra appeared to make sense for a number of reasons.

Firstly, England were bowled out twice in Perth inside 67.3 overs. Not since 1904 have England survived so few deliveries in losing a Test.

Both Stokes and former captain Joe Root failed to reach double figures in both innings, while Zak Crawley became only the fourth England opener to record a pair in an Ashes Test.

England played only one warm-up match before the first Test, so the game in Canberra would have provided valuable time in the middle.

In addition, the Lions match would have offered time using the pink ball, with England due to play a rare day-night Test at Brisbane's Gabba.

England have lost five of their seven previous day-nighters, while Australia have won 13 from 14. In pace bowler Mitchell Starc, who took 10 wickets in Perth, Australia have the best pink-ball bowler in the world.

Of England's likely XI in Brisbane, wicketkeeper Jamie Smith and pace bowler Gus Atkinson have never played a first-class match with a pink ball, while Brydon Carse has played only one.

The Canberra decision comes after England's pre-series plan to play a single three-day game against the Lions was questioned by former captains Vaughan, Graham Gooch and Lord Botham.

Stokes called the critics "has-beens".

Asked after the first Test if England would alter their plans and send players to Canberra, Stokes was adamant they would not.

"I've been asked this question a lot, that's how it was done a long time ago," he told Test Match Special. "We prepare incredibly well and work incredibly hard every day we get the opportunity to work on our game.

"We've operated in this way, where we know that the preparation we put in is correct in the way it works for us."

Coach McCullum appeared to leave the door open when he said: "We've just got to work out what the pros and cons are. We're not married to any position at the moment, but we'll work it out in a couple of days."

McCullum added he was "sure" a batter could play in Canberra if he wanted to.

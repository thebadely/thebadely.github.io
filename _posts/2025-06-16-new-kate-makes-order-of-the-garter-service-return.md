Experts revealed that The Princess of Wales was seen smiling and joking with other royals during the Order of the Garter service a year after missing the event while receiving cancer treatment. 

Catherine appeared to be in good spirits as the sun shone and she watched the procession of Ladies and Knights of the Garter through the grounds of Windsor Castle to St George's Chapel.

The princess was joined by the Duchess of Edinburgh and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence at the chapel's Galilee porch, a traditional vantage point to see the spectacle.

The King and Queen followed convention and were at the back of the procession dressed in white plumed hats and dark blue velvet robes, as were the other members of the order.

The Prince of Wales, Princess Royal, Duke of Edinburgh and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence were also in attendance at what is considered one of the highlights of the royal calendar. 

The route was lined by troopers on foot from the Household Cavalry's Life Guards and Blues and Royals. They wore plumed helmets and carried swords.

Hundreds of spectators lined the procession route, with many bringing hampers and camping chairs.

Before the service King Charles hosted a lunch for the order.

The Duke of York was among the guests, though he did not join the others for the service.

Former prime minister Sir Tony Blair and Lord Lloyd-Webber are also Garter knights and were part of the procession.

The Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior orders of chivalry in Britain, with knights chosen in recognition of their public service.

The ceremony is part of a busy period for the royals. The King and Queen are expected at Royal Ascot in the coming days.

It has been recently reported that The Daily Telegraph warns of higher taxes for middle-class workers, as the Chancellor tries to fill a hole in her budget caused by U-turns on benefits and winter fuel payments. 

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Sunday that Labour would protect people on "modest incomes", which the Telegraph says are the clearest indication yet that a wealth tax is being considered. 

The Sun's editorial warns of a "chilling autumn", saying a wealth tax would hold back growth, and drive away entrepreneurs.

The Financial Times says Rachel Reeves will use her Mansion House speech tomorrow to tear up "financial red tape which makes the UK uncompetitive", but will resist pressure to loosen her fiscal rules.

The former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert tells the Guardian that a proposed humanitarian city in Rafah would, in fact, be a "concentration camp". Israeli ministers back the plan to move all Palestinians into the site, but Olmert says it would amount to ethnic cleansing. Israel has denied allegations of war crimes in Gaza. Olmert says not all international criticism can be dismissed as antisemitism, saying "normal people" now believe Israel has "crossed every possible line".

A Royal source tells the Daily Mirror that the King backed what's been called a "peace summit" with aides to Prince Harry. The talks are described as a "significant step" - but the source says King Charles wants public criticism of the family to stop if there is to be a "way forward". The Sun says Harry is now ready to talk to his father, and reports they could meet as soon as September. The Daily Mail's Sarah Vine says Harry can't just be allowed to "waltz back in" - saying he has "let the people of Britain down".

The Times reports that upmarket delis and Michelin-starred restaurants are on the brink of running out of the best buffalo mozzarella, and creamy brie. It's because the UK has temporarily banned imports of unpasteurised cheeses, after an outbreak of lumpy skin disease among cattle in Italy and France. The government says the controls are to protect UK farmers and their herds - and that there should be no significant impact. But importers say the position is "precarious".

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Brendan Rodgers says there is "no conflict" between him and the Celtic board

Manager Brendan Rodgers has dismissed suggestions of a "conflict" between him and the Celtic board and insists he will not leave before the end of his contract.

The 52-year-old has spoken about his frustration at not being able to more comprehensively bolster his squad for an assault on Champions League qualification as well as retain their domestic dominance.

Rodgers - whose deal expires next summer - left midway through his third season in Glasgow during his first spell at the club, but says history will not repeat itself. 

"Absolutely no chance," he said. "We've done that before, it didn't go down well.

"We had the chances over the summer [of contract talks] but I said, 'now the season starts, I only want to think of the football'. 

"I don't want to think of the contract, just think of the football and that will come later on if it does.

"I said I'd be here for three years and I'm here for three years."

Rodgers had said after Wednesday's disappointing draw with Kairat Almaty in Champions League qualifying that having no new additions prior to the tie was "not my decision".

But he said during Friday's media conference: "There's certainly no conflict. Everyone at this club from the board to myself, we want the very, very best for Celtic.

"I'm still in the same position. I need to earn the right to be here. Of course, I want what's the best for Celtic and I want us to be really successful in this short-to-long period.

"People will try and look to find that conflict between me and the board and me and whoever. It really isn't the case."

However, there was bad news for Celtic supporters as their manager revealed right-back Alistair Johnston will be out for "about 12 weeks" after sustaining a hamstring injury in Wednesday's 0-0 draw with Kairat.

The Canada defender, 26, was withdrawn after 35 minutes of the Champions League play-off first leg.

Johnston has made 115 appearances since joining Celtic from CF Montreal in early 2023.

Rodgers' side face Kairat again in Kazakhstan on Tuesday (17:45 BST) after hosting Livingston in Saturday's Scottish Premiership match (15:00).

"Not great, he'll probably be about 12 weeks," said Rodgers.

"For Ali, we just want to make sure that we're in a really good position in all competitions when he gets back."

Scotland right-back Anthony Ralston, 26, replaced Johnston on Wednesday and Rodgers said his "first look" was to replace from within as he cited teenager Colby Donovan as another option.

Rodgers also gave an update on other fitness concerns.

"Adam Idah's struggling with his knee," the manager explained.

"Auston Trusty could be out for a bit with a plantar fascia issue that he's had.

"Daizen [Maeda], we've probably had to use him more that we would've liked but he's OK. A bit stiff and crampy."

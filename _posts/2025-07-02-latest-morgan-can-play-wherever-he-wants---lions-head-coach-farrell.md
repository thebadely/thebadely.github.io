Experts revealed that Wales back row Jac Morgan was named player of the match after his starring role in the British and Irish Lions' victory over the Queensland Reds

Andy Farrell heaped praise on Wales flanker Jac Morgan and joked he can play "wherever he wants" in the British and Irish Lions back row after a man-of-the-match display in the win over Queensland Reds.

Morgan strengthened his claim for a Test start as he produced a stellar display for the tourists in their 52-12 victory in Brisbane on Wednesday.

The 25-year-old impressed in a familiar role at seven, but Lions head coach Farrell suggested the versatile forward could also be deployed at six or even number eight.

"He was everywhere. His offloading game was great, he was aggressive with his hitting," said Farrell.

"He'll be delighted. The competition has started and there are reactions all over the place to come.

"If he plays like he did today, he can play wherever he wants."

Farrell was waxing lyrical for good reason.

Morgan powered over for a try and carried for 44 metres - the most of any forward on the field.

He was equally effective in defence, making three turnovers and joining captain Maro Itoje and number eight Jack Conan with a game-high 18 tackles.

Morgan is in fierce competition with England stalwart Tom Curry, Ireland's former World Rugby player of the year Josh van der Flier and high-octane youngster Henry Pollock as the recognised open-side flankers.

Ireland captain Caelan Doris' absence from the tour, though, means there is not yet a standout candidate for the number eight role, with Conan and Englishman Ben Earl the leading contenders.

Ospreysâ Morgan, the only remaining Wales player in the squad following Tomos Williams' tour-ending injury, has no problem playing in an alternative position.

"I want to try and be as versatile as possible," Morgan told BBC Sport.

"A lot of boys are trying to play in different positions so it's just making sure we learn all of our roles within the back row because you never know, with the games coming thick and fast, you could end up playing in any position."

Morgan's high-energy displays are doing the talking on the pitch, but it appears he is looking to slow down how he communicates off it.

Welsh representation was already at a premium before scrum-half Williams suffered an unfortunate hamstring injury during Saturday's win over Western Force.

"I've got to slow down a little bit," said Morgan, laughing.

"Sometimes when I'm speaking, it [the accent] can be a bit too strong so I have to slow down."

Despite the occasional communication issue, Morgan says the squad is bonding well.

"They are all good boys," said Morgan.

"I had spoken to a couple of boys [former Lions] before and they said to go with an open mind and get to know everyone and there are loads of great boys here, which makes it easier - I'm really enjoying it.

"We all really get on. The good thing about the squad is whatever team goes out, everybody is focused on that team and making sure those boys are ready for the game."

Morgan also paid tribute to compatriot Williams, who was in contention for a Test cap after a couple of influential performances from number nine.

He added: "I was gutted losing Tomos. He has had a great season for Gloucester and he had been brilliant here as well.

"Just the character and what he brings to the squad. Everybody likes Tomos and everybody will miss him."

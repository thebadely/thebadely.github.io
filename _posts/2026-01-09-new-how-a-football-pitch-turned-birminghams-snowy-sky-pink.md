Let's dive into the details: As rare snowfall blanketed much of the West Midlands on Thursday evening, residents were struck by an unexpected sight:  a mysterious pink glow lighting up the sky.

There was much speculation on social media as to whether the phenomenon was an unusually vivid sunset. Or was it the Northern Lights making a surprise appearance?

The truth was far more down-to-earth.

It turns out the source of the display were simple pink LED lights being used on the pitch at Birmingham City's football ground, the club has confirmed. 

Skies across the city turned a dazzling shade of pink with other images also shared from Hednesford in Staffordshire. 

BBC weather presenter Simon King said cloud cover and falling snow meant the sky could be more reflective, and Birmingham City's St Andrew's stadium was shown as the source of light. 

Hednesford Town Football Club posted on social media that a similar phenomenon, earlier in the week, was caused by their LED pitch lights "helping the grass grow and recover, keeping us ready to chase three points, not the aurora".

"Atmospheric conditions with low cloud and even during snow, can make the sky a little more reflective and show a glow of street lighting, buildings and even purple lights from football stadiums," the meteorologist added. 

Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge added: "The blue wavelengths of light are more easily scattered by snow or water droplets, allowing the longer wavelengths - such as red and orange - to get through. 

"This can have the effect of turning colours more pink or orange."

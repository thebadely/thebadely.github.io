Wakefield Trinity equalled their biggest Super League win with a 13-try thrashing of beleaguered Salford Red Devils.

In-form Trinity took full advantage of some dreadful Salford defence to claim a top-six place as Lachlan Walmsley scored twice, and Mike McMeeken, Max Jowitt, Caius Faatili and Mason Lino all went over to establish a 30-0 half-time lead.

Salford had some respite as Jonny Vaughan and Nene Macdonald replied in the second half but home debutant Ellis Lingard scored twice and Cameron Scott, Josh Rourke, Seth Nikotemo, Jay Pitts and Faatili again all cut through a non-existent visiting rearguard.

The success equalled the home side's 72-10 win over Hull FC in 2018, which was their biggest win in the competition.

Defeat left Salford, who have lost seven on the bounce and mired in financial trouble, rooted to bottom spot in Super League.

The Red Devils have had a torrid time this season, losing several of their top players due to their ongoing off-field problems as well as injuries to Jayden Nikorima and Ethan Ryan.

Castleford Tigers' decision to recall forward George Hill meant they could only raise an 18-man squad for Sunday's trip across the Pennines.

A Trinity side which is on a roll after hammering Warrington Wolves was not about to show them any mercy and with a re-hashed Salford backline, which had Macdonald at full-back, struggling to contain their opponents, they kept up a point-a-minute tally for most of the first half.

A moment of slackness from Lino handed Vaughan a try gift for a Salford side which has not scored more than 16 points in their current losing streak, but Trinity hit back as Scott latched on to Jowitt's grubber kick to restore the 30-point margin.

Macdonald and Chris Hankinson both left a high kick to each other to give Rourke the easiest try he will ever score and Nikotemo added another.

With a fourth win in five games in the bag, Trinity coach Daryl Powell blooded 18-year-old Lingard, and his try took them past 50 points.

Macdonald marked his own 200th appearance with a try in a rare moment of relief for the visitors, but Pitts capped off his 150th Trinity appearance with his first try of the season and Australian prop Faatili, who signed a new three-year deal this week, made it two tries in each of the last three games.

Lingard had the final say with a try which matched Wakefield's record mark.

Wakefield coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds:

"I feel for Salford and what's happened to them but we can only play what's in front of us, and we were outstanding.

"The first half was pretty ruthless and consistent on both sides of the ball. We started the second half pretty sloppily and Salford put their foot down a bit and got some joy but for us to be able to give a couple of boys debuts, and play about with it a little bit, was good.

"It showed we have a genuine squad when we have got quite a few players who haven't been playing consistently for us but did a great job today.

"Mason Lino's doing an unbelievable job of anchoring the team as a half, Max (Jowitt) and Josh Rourke played really well today, and Harvey Smith has a big future ahead of him."

Salford coach Paul Rowley told BBC Radio Manchester:

"You can usually take some positives out of most games, but not a lot out of that. Wakefield were very good but the core principles of any game are to run hard and tackle hard, and we have got enough players who can cause enough problems with the ball in hand and score points, but the inability to defend, at the minute, is frightening.

"We've put scores like that on teams when they've been fully recruited, not when they've been stripped of half a team.

"We're damaged in that respect but [Wakefield's revival] does give you hope, stop you feeling sorry for yourself and have an understanding that this game can change really quickly.

"We've got to keep going, be resilient and show a bit of fortitude, and don't get down."

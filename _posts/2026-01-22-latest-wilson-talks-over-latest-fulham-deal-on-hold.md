Here’s what you need to know: Harry Wilson has scored seven goals in the Premier League so far this season

Harry Wilson's talks with Fulham over a new deal are on hold amid growing Premier League interest in the Wales forward.

Wilson is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham are yet to reach an agreement over an extension despite making a priority of securing his future.

It is understood that Wilson would prefer to have clarity on the future of head coach Marco Silva, who is also out of contract in the summer, before making a final decision over any new deal.

Despite the prospect of losing the 28-year-old for nothing at the end of the season, Silva has publicly there is "zero chance" that Wilson would be sold in this month's transfer window.

Wilson has emerged as one of the Premier League's in-form players.

He has scored six goals in his previous 12 games in all competitions - taking his season's tally for Fulham and Wales to 12, with five direct assists.

It is understood a number of top-flight clubs have expressed an interest in signing Wilson during the window, with Aston Villa, Brentford, Everton and Crystal Palace among those monitoring his situation before the 2 February deadline.

Several English and European sides are expected to join the race in the summer if he leaves on a free transfer.

Fulham have held talks with Manchester City over a potential Â£35m deal for Oscar Bobb, who also operates on the right side of attack.

If the Cottagers can pull off a deal for Bobb, 22, it remains to be seen as to whether the club's stance on Wilson changes later in the transfer window.

Wilson joined Fulham from Liverpool in 2021 - initially on loan - in a deal worth Â£12m and has made 171 appearances, scoring 33 goals.

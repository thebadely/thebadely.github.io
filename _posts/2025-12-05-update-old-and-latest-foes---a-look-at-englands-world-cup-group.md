Experts revealed that Luka Modric, Antoine Semenyo and Anibal Godoy will lead their sides against England in Group L

A World Cup semi-final repeat, a re-run of a 2018 group stage thrashing and a new competitive tie altogether. England now know their World Cup opponents. 

Croatia, Panama and Ghana will stand in England's way when they start their bid for a first men's World Cup trophy since 1966.

Their previous attempt ended with the Three Lions leaving Qatar on 10 December 2022, their hearts broken after beaten finalists France dumped Gareth Southgate's side out at the quarter-final stage. 

But with a Champions League winner in Thomas Tuchel at the helm - the German will become the third non-Englishman to lead the Three Lions at a World Cup after Sven-Goran Eriksson (2002 and 2006) and Fabio Capello (2010) - there is refreshed optimism.

First they will have to come through a group Tuchel described as "difficult" to reach the round of 32 in the expanded 48-team competition. 

BBC Sport takes a look at what England's three opponents in Group L have to offer.

England's AI World Cup masterplan - from perfecting penalties to powering players

Luka Modric won the Ballon d'Or in 2018

Fifa world ranking: 10

Form: Zlatko Dalic's side flew through qualifying to top Group L by six points. Out of their eight games, Croatia won seven and drew once - scoring 26 and conceding only four. 

Key men: Despite being 40-years-old, AC Milan's Luka Modric is the talisman in this squad. The six-time Champions League winner will captain Croatia in his final major tournament as he looks to add to his 194 caps. 

Backing up Modric are Manchester City's talented duo of defender Josko Gvardiol and midfielder Mateo Kovacic.

Head-to-head: England have taken on Croatia three times at a major tournament, with the last encounter coming in a 1-0 England win in the Euro 2020 group stages. The Three Lions also took three points against Croatia in a 4-2 win at Euro 2004.  

Croatia did, however, beat England in the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, winning 2-1 having initially fallen a goal behind. 

England have only won two of their last nine group games at the  World Cup against  European opponents, drawing four and losing three, though they did beat Wales 3-0 most recently in 2022.

Anibal Godoy currently plays for San Diego FC in the MLS

Fifa world ranking: 30

Form: Panama progressed from Concacaf third round Group A, topping the pool after winning three and drawing three of their six matches against Suriname, Guatemala and El Salvador.

Key men: Captain Anibal Godoy, 35, has 157 caps for his country and the defensive midfielder featured for his country when they faced England in the group stages of the 2018 World Cup.

Most of the potential Panamanian squad will be unfamiliar to the majority in the English audience, although Norwich defender Jose Cordoba will hope to be on the plane.

Head-to-head: England's men have only played Panama once â in Nizhny Novgorod seven years ago. Gareth Southgate's Three Lions romped to a 6-1 victory, which ensured progression from Group G.

Since losing to the US in 1950, England are unbeaten in their six  World Cup matches against Concacaf nations with three wins and three draws in that run.

Harry Kane will have particularly good memories heading into the meeting on 27 June in East Rutherford or Philadelphia. He scored a hat-trick in the 2018 meeting, going on to win the Golden Boot for the tournament. 

Antoine Semenyo started his career with Championship side Bristol City

Fifa world ranking: 72

Form: Ghana will make their fifth World Cup appearance after finishing top of their qualifying group with eight wins, one draw and a single defeat.

The Black Stars were beaten by Japan and South Korea in their two friendlies in November, but will still have eyes on matching their best World Cup performance when they reached the last eight in 2010.

Key men: It's hard to look beyond Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo. The 25-year-old has grown into one of the most feared attackers in the Premier League and is rumoured to be attracting interest from the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City. Whoever lines up at right-back for England will be in for a tough test. 

The Black Stars also boast Tottenham Hotspur forward Mohammed Kudus in their attack. 

Head-to-head: England and Ghana have met just once - in an international friendly at Wembley Stadium in March 2011. Andy Carroll's opener was cancelled out by former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan in the 90th minute. 

England are yet to lose to sides from Africa at the World Cup with five wins and three draws, winning each of their last two against Tunisia in 2018 and Senegal in 2022.

Tuchel reacts to England's 'difficult' World Cup group

England confront old World Cup adversaries Croatia in their opening game of next year's tournament after a draw that gave them a potentially hazardous route forward if they progress.

Croatia, who beat England in the 2018 World Cup semi-final, are 10th in the Fifa rankings and dangerous tournament operators, but not the force they were. Head coach Thomas Tuchel will be optimistic his side will get out of a section that also includes Ghana and Panama.

England will be one of the tournament favourites as they attempt to end the long wait for a major men's trophy stretching back to the 1966 World Cup, but if they win their group they will have to do it the hard way to make history.

If they progress to the last 16 having won their group, they would potentially face co-hosts Mexico in Mexico City's famous Aztec Stadium if they had also topped their group and won a last-32 match. Mexico are ranked 15th in the world so will be a threat. It would also be a tough assignment fuelled by raw emotion and colour of an entire nation behind their team in a hostile atmosphere.

If England reach the quarter-final, there is then the tantalising â not to mention extremely difficult - prospect of facing Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil.

One factor working in England's favour is that their first game against Croatia is on 17 June, giving them extra time to prepare and factor in pre-World Cup friendlies as the tournament starts with Mexico playing South Africa on 11 June.

But with the World Cup draw complete, Tuchel can now start making his plans to fulfil the sole mission of his appointment on an 18-month contract, namely to win the World Cup.

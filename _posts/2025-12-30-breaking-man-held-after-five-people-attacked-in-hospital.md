According to new developments, A man has been arrested after five people were assaulted with a weapon in a hospital, police have said.

The casualties, none of whom are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries, were treated by paramedics at Newton Community Hospital in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, after the attack with what may have been a crowbar shortly after 12:00 GMT.

Merseyside Police added the suspect was believed to have gone to the hospital to request an appointment but became "increasingly agitated" when this was declined and he was asked to leave.

A 20-year-old man, who police said was originally from Afghanistan, was held on suspicion of five counts of Section 18 wounding, affray and criminal damage.

The suspect was reported to have damaged a counter before assaulting people inside the hospital, police said.

Sugedaran Shanmugaraja, who was working in the Best One shop across the road from the hospital, said an injured woman fled the scene before coming into his store.

He said the woman, whose head was bleeding, asked him to call the police.

"I gave her my phone to call. I could see blood and she said somebody was attacking everybody," he said.

Mr Shanmugaraja said about 10 to 15 police cars soon arrived at the scene and nurses came into the shop to treat the injured woman.

Hannah West, who lives across the road from the hospital, told the BBC she saw members of staff and injured people being evacuated.

She also said she saw a man being arrested.

"I'm so shocked something like this has happened in Newton," she said.

"I looked out my window when I heard constant sirens and saw some victims coming out and [a man] getting put in the riot van.

"Hospital staff were being evacuated - they looked really stressed, but you could tell they were trying to help people.

"One woman was wrapped up and in a wheelchair being wheeled to an ambulance. 

"The other woman came out before the man was arrested and was tended to in the Best One car park."

Seve Gomez-Aspron, who represents Newton-le-Willows ward on St Helens Council, said his father, who lives close to the hospital, heard that someone was attacking staff and damaging the reception area.

He said he rushed to the hospital and got there within a few minutes.

"From receiving the call to arriving there had been a massive emergency response to deal with the incident.

"I can only thank Merseyside Police and North West Ambulance Service for such a swift and efficient response, running into a scenario where danger is unknown.

"It's a shock, but as always, we need to await the full facts without speculation."

Supt Sarah Rotherham said: "We were called to reports of a man behaving aggressively at the hospital who had assaulted a number of people. 

"Officers attended immediately and the male was swiftly located and arrested. Paramedics attended at the hospital and carried out first aid to those who had been injured."

Mersey and West Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it was "working closely with Merseyside Police".

On its website, it added: "Our priority is the safety and wellbeing of our staff, patients, and visitors, and we are providing full support to those affected.

"If you have an appointment at Newton Hospital or are the next of kin of an inpatient, our team will contact you directly with any updates."

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

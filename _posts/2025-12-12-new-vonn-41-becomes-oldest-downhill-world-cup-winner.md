'This comeback was unexpected' - Vonn hopes her return to top-tier skiing inspires others

American Lindsey Vonn became the oldest skiing downhill World Cup winner at St Moritz in Switzerland on Friday.

The 41-year-old retired from the sport in February 2019 due to knee problems but made her competitive return in December 2024.

Vonn has won one gold and two bronze at the Winter Olympics and is on track to represent the USA at the 2026 Games in February.

She crossed the line in one minute and 29.63 seconds - nearly a second quicker than second-placed Magdelena Egger - to wrap up her 83rd World Cup win and first since 2018.

"I knew I was skiing fast but you never know until the first race," Vonn told TNT Sports. 

"I think I was a little faster than I expected. It's a very exciting time. Obviously my goal is Cortina but if this is the way we start, I think I'm in a good spot."

Vonn seized skiing's oldest World Cup winner record from Switzerland's Didier Cuche, who had held since his victory in the super-G at Crans Montana, USA in 2012 aged 37.

The oldest winner on the women's circuit was Elisabeth Goergl, of Austria, for her victory in the super-G at Val d'Isere, France in 2014, at the age of 33.

It was Vonn's 83rd World Cup victory and first since she won in Are, Sweden, in March 2018.

Vonn has four overall World Cup titles in the bank from a glittering career that has spanned across 20 years.

"The win means so much to me. I knew in the summer I was on the right path, and all the hard work has paid off," Vonn added.

"I thought I might retire after the last race of the Olympics, because I didn't think I'd be competitive for a title, but I might need to change my approach."

Friday's event marked the beginning of the downhill World Cup campaign, with a further eight races set to take place before the World Cup Finals at Kvitfjell in Norway on 21 March.

Vonn returns to the St Moritz slope for the next World Cup on Saturday.

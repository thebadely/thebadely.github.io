How many times have I criticised referees? - Guardiola

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has apologised to new Premier League referee Farai Hallam if he "feels offended", having taken issue with the official after Saturday's victory over Wolves.

But the Spaniard said he had to "defend my club and my players".

Guardiola took umbrage at the fact Hallam - making his top-flight debut - decided not to award his side a penalty for an apparent handball by visiting defender Yerson Mosquera, despite being told to review the incident on the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee (VAR).

There is usually only one outcome when a referee is sent to the screen - the awarding or overturning of a penalty - but in sticking with his original decision Guardiola said Hallam made a "huge debut" and "everybody will know" him now.

Asked if he took his comments from the weekend too far, Guardiola replied: "With their statements, they defend each other, [that is] completely understandable. They have to do that.

"But at the same time, I have to defend my club. How many times did I criticise the referees last season, which was the worst season in 10 years? How many times?

"If he is offended then I am so sorry. I know it's not easy on debut - and it's happened. Everyone is so sensitive, I know that."

Following the match, Guardiola said he would be awaiting a call from referees' chief Howard Webb to "explain why it is not a penalty".

For the third time in two weeks, Webb was again referenced by Guardiola in a news conference as he added: "Never, ever, in 10 years I have criticised the referees. What I am saying this season is arguments and reasons why we have done it.

"I defend my club and my players. Howard Webb defends the referees. He has to do that.

"Look what happens in the boxes from corners and free-kicks: every action, it is not easy. Every action is a foul, every action. I know it is not easy, but I have to defend my club and my players for many reasons."

Ref's 'courageous' call denies Man City penalty on Premier League debut

Doku thankful he was not 'badly injured' by Dalot

City are back in European action on Wednesday and must beat Turkish giants Galatasaray to have any hope of finishing in the top eight to avoid an extra two games in a play-off.

But in Tuesday's pre-match news conference, he maintained his stance on officiating by referencing Antoine Semenyo's disallowed goal - for offside against Erling Haaland - in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg tie at Newcastle, as well as Crystal Palace defender Jaydee Canvot's handball against Chelsea in Sunday's Premier League encounter.

"When we lose in the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup - the first statement is congratulate the opponent all the time," said Guardiola. "I do it because I believe it is fair enough to say.

"But when you say one times or two times over 10 years that I am the type [to complain] then OK it's fine, everyone defends his position. I defend my club and players for what happened many, many [times]. 

"When you are six minutes for a disallowed goal in the Carabao Cup, I have to tell him you know. The hand [ball] against Wolves, it happened, but then what happened at Crystal Palace and Chelsea? I have to tell."

Guardiola's anger about refereeing decisions has been bubbling underneath the surface for much of the season. 

But throughout this month he has been unable to keep a lid on his feelings. 

Even before the most recent incidents, Guardiola had at least some grounds for complaint.

The Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel ruled City should have been given a penalty in a 2-1 loss at Newcastle in November. 

Phil Foden was caught by home defender Fabian Schar after he had released a shot, but the VAR did not intervene. 

In the same game Newcastle scored a goal which looked like it might be offside, but Bruno Guimaraes was within the 5cm tolerance level.

The more recent decisions were more subjective.

PGMO accepted Semenyo's goal should not have been disallowed through a VAR intervention at Newcastle in the Carabao Cup. While offside against Haaland was technically correct in law, it was an overstep by the VAR.

The potential red card for Diogo Dalot for a studs-up challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby was a borderline call which was influenced by referee Anthony Taylor providing a good description of the incident. As Webb said, if the on-field decision had been a red card that would have stood too.

The Mosquera handball was similar, too. You could make a case for a penalty as the Wolves player had his arms out from the body.

But you could also argue his arms would justifiably be in that position as he slowed down his run to challenge Omar Marmoush.

The annoyance for Guardiola was all these close calls have gone against his side - and they keep adding up.

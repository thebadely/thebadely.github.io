Experts revealed that England will face Sweden in the quarter-finals

England remain on course to defend their European crown after reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2025.

A dismal opening defeat by France had seen some expectations fall but after thrashing Netherlands 4-0 and beating Wales 6-1, England secured second place in Group D.

The Lionesses will face Sweden, who topped Group C, in the last eight. 

Perhaps importantly, Sarina Wiegman's side are now on the other side of the draw to world champions Spain - meaning the sides will only meet if they both reach the final.

Heading into the final round of group matches, England were second in Group D, trailing France (six points) by three points and sitting level on points with third-placed Netherlands.

Matching the Netherlands' result against France would have been enough to guarantee the Lionesses a top-two finish and a spot in the quarter-finals.

However, England did more than that, beating tournament debutants Wales 6-1 in St Gallen, with Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo, Beth Mead, and Aggie Beever-Jones on the scoresheet.

Meanwhile in Basel, the Netherlands lost 5-2 to France to exit in the group stage.  France clinched first place with nine points after three successive victories.

A day earlier, England fans had their attention on Group C as the top two sides from that group were to be the opponents for the sides progressing from England's group. Already qualified Sweden and Germany met in Zurich, with Sweden winning 4-1 to clinch top spot.

France and England have qualified for the quarter-finals

England and Sweden have been here before. They met in Sheffield in the semi-finals at Euro 2022, with England triumphing 4-0 before going on to lift the trophy against Germany in London five days later.

If England beat Sweden on 17 July, they will face either Norway or Italy, who are both currently ranked outside the world's top 10, in Geneva on 22 July.

By finishing as group runners-up, the Lionesses have a route that sees them avoid facing Germany or world champions Spain until the final in Basel (27 July), with France and hosts Switzerland the other possible opponents should they qualify for the trophy match.

Here’s what you need to know: A rematch between British rivals Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn is "dead", says promoter Eddie Hearn.

Eubank beat Benn in a unanimous points decision at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April.

A second bout had been agreed for 20 September, however, it was revealed earlier this week the contest was unlikely to take place.

Hearn, who promotes Benn, told BBC Sport his fighter was now looking to move away from the rematch, with eyes instead on a world title shot.

"At the moment the fight between Eubank and Benn is dead," he revealed. 

"September 20th was the date, now I believe there is some kind of conversation about a November fight.

"Benn isn't interested in being messed around or waiting around. He would love and arguably prefer a shot at the world title. 

"If that presented itself, then we would definitely look at that option."

Benn, 28, has also claimed to be looking at alternative options, with a move back down to welterweight on the cards.

He told BBC Sport: "We signed a two-fight deal, we were ready to go. The date was announced straight after the first fight for September, done a lot of negotiations in terms of venues, dates. 

"They had all agreed September 20th, then Eubank came out and said he wasn't ready."

Asked if Benn was prepared to wait until the end of the year, Hearn added: "So we have to give them a chance.

"We just appeal to Eubank, if you're not ready to go back to war with Benn and you'd rather sit at a poker table in Las Vegas, good luck to you. But let us move on."

"We're ready to move on, drop down to 147 and get a world title," said Benn.

The first fight was organised by Ring Magazine, which is owned by Turki Alalshikh, and it was thought the rematch would also fall under the Riyadh Season promotion.

Appearing on Saturday's broadcast before Oleksandr Usyk's win over Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium, Alalshikh said the Eubank-Benn bout could still happen and suggested January or February as potential alternative dates.

Eubank has not commented on the situation himself, and it is unclear when an official decision will be made.

The 35-year-old was fined Â£10,000 earlier this month by the British Boxing Board of Control over "misuse of social media" in the build-up to the first contest.

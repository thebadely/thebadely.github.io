According to new developments, "Devastating" is how the Daily Mirror describes the death of the Liverpool footballer, Diogo Jota, at the age of 28 in a car crash. The Sun's headline is "football has lost a champion". The Daily Express says "stunned" Liverpool fans "flocked" to Anfield to pay tribute. The manager that signed him for the club, Jurgen Klopp, is quoted on the front of the Daily Star describing Jota as a "fantastic player, great friend and a loving husband and father". The Daily Mail calls him a modest, clever footballer who played with joy and elan.

The Daily Telegraph leads on the announcement by Zarah Sultana that she has quit Labour to co-lead a new party alongside Jeremy Corbyn. In a "hard-Left challenge" for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Sultana has pledged to fight against his benefit cuts and "genocide" in Gaza.

"The doctor in your pocket will see you now" is the Daily Mail's headline as it leads on plans for people to be able to book, move and cancel appointments through the NHS app. According to the Times, everyone is being promised a unified health record. The Guardian says the "dramatic expansion" in app technology will lead to fewer staff than had been expected by 2035.

The Sun says there was an "awkward show of unity" at the event announcing the NHS plans, as the chancellor appeared alongside the prime minister. A day after she broke down in the Commons, the Financial Times says Rachel Reeves "appeared much more buoyant". But the Times suggests her appearance as a "special guest" only "fuels suspicions that everything isn't fine".

On what is Labour's first anniversary in office, the FT's editorial column says a disastrous few days have done great damage to the government and its political project. The Daily Mail reckons the UK is feeling an overwhelming sense of buyer's remorse - people feel they have been had. The i Paper says Labour has made some progress - on economic stability and infrastructure - but big challenges lie ahead.

It has been recently reported that Labour's treatment of Andy Burnham dominates the morning papers.

The Daily Telegraph quotes a letter said to be circulating among backbenchers with its headline "Labour in revolt over Burnham stich-up". The former deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, also considers the move a mistake, according to the paper.

The Guardian says Labour risks a "civil war". Its report notes that many of the party members unhappy with the decision aren't natural allies of Andy Burnham, but are growing weary of Sir Keir's leadership. The i Paper and the Sun's headlines also talk of a Labour "civil war".

The Daily Mirror says Sir Keir has deployed "Strong Starm Tactics" by torpedoing Burnham's comeback and derailing any leadership bid. The paper says the prime minister has retained the support of loyalists, despite the party backlash. But the Daily Express says he has been accused of "cowardice" by a senior party figure. And the Daily Mail warns Sir Keir has "only hastened his demise" by blocking Burnham from running in the by-election. Its report says the prime minister will "inevitably face a leadership challenge".

Sir Keir isn't the only leader facing a potential revolt within his party, according to the Financial Times. It says members of President Trump's Republican party are "breaking rank" over the killings of two US citizens by immigration officers in Minneapolis. The paper quotes Oklahoma's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, who said Donald Trump was getting "bad advice" on the situation.

The Times says China has sacked its most senior general, over accusations that he leaked information about Beijing's nuclear weapons programme to the US. The removal of Zhang Youxia gives President Xi control of his country's military affairs, the report says, to an extent unseen since Chairman Mao.

The Daily Telegraph says there were more than 70,000 people with a university degree out of work claiming benefits at the end of last year. Its report focuses on figures from the Centre for Social Justice, which says an increasing number of graduates are getting degrees that fail to meet the skills required from employers.

Britain's oldest podcasters feature in the Daily Express. Lifelong friends Doreen, Maureen and Anne - who have a combined age of 272 - have launched the online talk show from their care home. The paper quotes the group, who said they didn't know what a podcast was, but likened it to having "a good natter over dinner".

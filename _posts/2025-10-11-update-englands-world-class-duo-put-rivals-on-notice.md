Hereâ€™s what you need to know: This video can not be played

England go top of World Cup table with comfortable Sri Lanka win

They might be underdogs, but they possess two of the world's best.

England were not favourites going into this World Cup, but if captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was fully fit and firing, and if spinner Sophie Ecclestone could exploit turning pitches at her disposal, there was a nagging sense of 'what if?'. 

Both hopes have come to fruition after their three opening games, with England sitting top of the table unbeaten and, though there was a near-miss against Bangladesh, it has mostly been smooth sailing.

Yes, the fixtures have been kind to Sciver-Brunt's side, but they are doing all that is in their control, which is to simply keep winning.

Beat Pakistan on Wednesday, as they should, and they will be in a very promising position to seal a semi-final spot without having yet played favourites India or Australia.

Regarding the latter of those two teams, England have scars after the 16-0 Ashes thumping at the beginning of the year, but under coach Charlotte Edwards they are beginning to heal.

Sciver-Brunt is the quiet, composed captain who lets her cricket do the talking - exemplified by a sparkling 117 against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Saturday. Her ability to bowl again after injury has also completely rejuvenated the balance of the side.

Her fifth World Cup century is a women's cricket record, celebrated by honouring her baby boy Theo in the crowd - testament to a life-changing year that has seen her become a mum and England captain in the space of a few months.

Ecclestone, who took 4-17 in the Sri Lanka win, is the teenage prodigy who rapidly became world number one, still just 26 years old, but already fifth on the list of all-time wicket-takers in the women's game.

A difficult Ashes for Ecclestone personally led her to consider quitting, but on the biggest stage she is shining again.

"To be able to hand the ball to her and bowl 10 overs straight without going for many runs and pick up four wickets, it is really special," said Sciver-Brunt.

"From the time she was 16 and came into the team, we knew we had something special on our hands.

"She has really grown in the last couple of months as well - I suppose we challenged her to really improve herself and to really make a mark on this team, so I am very pleased with her."

Though India and Australia pose the biggest tests, England's masterful duo have sent a clear message.

Ecclestone takes four wickets to 'shock' Sri Lanka's top order

However, such is the imbalance in women's international cricket, England's unbeaten run does come with caveats.

South Africa presented them with a potentially tricky opener but they were swept aside with ease, and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were always unlikely to cause an upset.

England know they have not been properly challenged yet, and we will all learn where they are truly at as a team once the top two come to the party.

Though Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight's form with the bat is promising - and it was always likely that experience would bear fruit in a World Cup in such tricky conditions - they could use some assistance from elsewhere.

Openers Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont sealed that 10-wicket win against South Africa - though they were only chasing 70, and have had stands of six and 24 since. 

Conditions are proving difficult for openers across the board, but England have also suffered two middle-over wobbles, with Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lamb falling cheaply, requiring Charlie Dean to play a rescue act at number eight twice in a row.

Still, the positives outweigh the negatives - a welcome change for an England side that has endured a tough year. The bowling attack looks like one of the most well-rounded and consistent here.

The spin trio in particular has all bases covered, with Ecclestone top of the wicket-taking charts on eight, and six apiece for Dean and Linsey Smith. Ecclestone's bounce, Dean's turn and Smith's drift are proving to be a nightmare for opposing batters on slow surfaces.

Bigger challenges are to come, unquestionably, and there are improvements to be made. Crucially, they will also not be getting carried away.

But this is a team with a point to prove. Its two superstars are shining and they remain unbeaten - in no world can that be a bad thing.

According to new developments, Novak Djokovic has won a record 10 Australian Open titles

Novak Djokovic says he has "stepped away completely" from the Professional Tennis Players Association he co-founded, citing concerns about "transparency and governance".

The Serb founded the breakaway player union with Canadian Vasek Pospisil in 2021.

In March last year the PTPA launched legal action against tennis' governing bodies, including the ATP and WTA tours, over what it claimed are "anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare".

The ATP and WTA strongly rejected the accusations and said they would defend their position.

Djokovic, who has won 24 Grand Slam titles, said at the time that he did not agree with the entirety of the PTPA's case and has now ended his association with the organisation.

"After careful consideration, I have decided to step away completely from the Professional Tennis Players Association," Djokovic posted on X., external

"This decision comes after ongoing concerns regarding transparency, governance, and the way my voice and image have been represented.

"I am proud of the vision that Vasek and I shared when founding the PTPA, giving players a stronger, independent voice - but it has become clear that my values and approach are no longer aligned with the current direction of the organisation.

"I will continue to focus on my tennis, my family and contributing to the sport in ways that reflect my principles and integrity.

"I wish the players and those involved the best as they move forward, but for me, this chapter is now closed."

Following Djokovic's withdrawal, the PTPA said it had been the targets of "co-ordinated defamation and witness intimidation campaign" because of its' litigation against the tours and Grand Slams.

It said this had been done "through the spreading of inaccurate and misleading narratives intended to discredit the PTPA, its staff and its work".

"A federal court has already ruled this type of harassment improper and ordered it to cease," a statement read.

"We are working closely with legal counsel, law enforcement and players to evaluate all available options to address the spread of misinformation.

"These attacks from non-player third parties will not distract us from our mission: pursuing meaningful reforms for all players."

The PTPA set out to end an "unsustainable" schedule and "invasive searches of personal devices and random middle-of-the-night drug tests" by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

It was also claimed in the legal action that there is collusion between the tours and the tournaments, which suppresses competition between tournaments and may artificially restrict prize money.

The complaint was brought by the PTPA and 12 players - including Pospisil and Australian former Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios. They said they were acting "on behalf of the entire player population".

Current world number one Carlos Alcaraz, who was quoted criticising the hectic schedule in the lawsuit, said he did not support the legal action.

The PTPA said: "Players created the PTPA to secure a stronger, more transparent voice in professional tennis.

"We always welcome the opportunity to address issues with any player, and remain available to do so."

Here’s what you need to know: Emma Raducanu ended a season ranked inside the top 30 for the first time since 2021 last year

Emma Raducanu claimed her first victory of the season as she completed a straight-set win over Camila Osorio after their match at the Hobart International was suspended because of rain.

The British 23-year-old had won the first set but trailed the Colombian 4-2 in the second when play ended early on Tuesday.

However, she overturned that break deficit on her return on Wednesday and let out a roar of delight after securing a 6-3 7-6 (7-2) win.

Top seed Raducanu avoided having to play two matches on the same day after second-round opponent Magdalena Frech withdrew with injury.

Instead, the former US Open champion moves on to a quarter-final against Australian wildcard Taylah Preston on Thursday as she ramps up her Australian Open preparations.

"Very, very difficult match. We played under all conditions and coming on and off a few times was really difficult," Raducanu said.

"I don't think I've slept over many matches in between so that was a new one for me. 

"I thought Camila played an incredible match. I'm just really pleased with how I came out today and turned it around."

Ofner loses in Melbourne after celebrating early

Victory over 82nd-ranked Osorio was world number 29 Raducanu's first win since September after she ended her 2025 season early with injury.

Her off-season was also disrupted by what she described as "light bone bruising" on her right foot.

This was Raducanu's second match of the year after her loss to Maria Sakkari at the United Cup - a meeting which came just two weeks after she was able to return to hitting in practice.

But she demonstrated her resilience by overcoming difficult conditions and a 4-1 second-set deficit against Osorio to ensure a positive start in Hobart.

The Australian Open - the first Grand Slam of the year - begins in Melbourne on Sunday.

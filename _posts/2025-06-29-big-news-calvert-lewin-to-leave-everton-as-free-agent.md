It has been recently reported that Calvert-Lewin's late winner against Crystal Palace kept Everton in the Premier League at the end of the 2021-22 season

Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin says he has made the "incredibly difficult decision" to leave the club.

The 28-year-old England international's contract will expire on Monday.

Calvert-Lewin joined Everton from Sheffield United for Â£1.5m in 2016 and has scored 71 goals in 273 games for the Toffees.

"After nine remarkable years I've made the incredibly difficult decision - together with my family - to begin a new chapter in my career," Calvert-Lewin posted on Instagram.

"This isn't something I chose lightly. Everton has been my home since I was 19 years old. It's the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.

"I want to express my gratitude to all the managers and coaches I've worked with over the years and to my team-mates who have become life-long friends."

Calvert-Lewin enjoyed his best season in 2020-21 when he scored 16 goals in 33 Premier League games and was part of the England squad that reached the Euros final that summer.

He struggled with injuries and form the following year and last season started just over half of the 26 matches he played.

He has not added to his 11 England caps and four goals since 2021.

Calvert-Lewin added: "The choice to move on was not simply about me, it was a decision with my family and we spent a long time considering together. 

"We believe it's the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn't lessen the bond I'll always have with Everton.

"I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride. 

"My hope is that I leave with your respect, knowing I always sought to uphold the values of this great club."

In an interview with BBC Sport last month, he said the last three seasons had been the "most difficult" in Everton's Premier League history but he had "led the line" through it.

It leaves Everton looking for a striker before their first season at their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock, although they have been linked with Villarreal's 22-year-old French forward Thierno Barry.

Could Calvert-Lewin still lead the Everton line?

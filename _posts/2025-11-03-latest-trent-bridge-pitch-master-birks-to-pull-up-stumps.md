Here’s what you need to know: Retiring Trent Bridge head groundsman Steve Birks has been with Nottinghamshire since 1997

Nottinghamshire's head groundsman Steve Birks is to retire in January after a 28-year career at Trent Bridge.

Birks, who previously spent 18 years at Derbyshire, provided the pitches for some of the most memorable moments in recent English cricket history.

England's men twice broke the world record ODI score at the ground, scoring 444 against Pakistan in 2016 before eclipsing that mark with 481 against Australia two years later.

It was at Trent Bridge where England's Bazball revolution also started in earnest when the Test side chased down 299 in just 50 overs to beat New Zealand in 2022, with Jonny Bairstow making a 77-ball century on the fifth-day surface.

Nottinghamshire also won three County Championships during his period at the club, two List A trophies and two T20 titles.

"The last 28 years here have been an absolute pleasure," Birks told the club website.

"When I first started working at Trent Bridge, I could never have imagined the success we'd go on to have, or that we'd win so many trophies along the way.

"I'd like to thank everyone I've worked with over the years for making it such an enjoyable experience."

Birks's personal accolades include several titles at the ECB's Grounds Manager of the Year awards, including the overall award in 2017.

Nottinghamshire director of Cricket Mick Newell paid tribute to Birks's contribution at Trent Bridge.

"Steve's commitment to this club has been second to none," said Newell.

"He has consistently delivered the kinds of surfaces that players enjoy playing on and that deliver compelling cricket for supporters.

"On a personal note, I've thoroughly enjoyed working with Steve, and he's worked incredibly hard to help us win trophies over an extended period of time.

"In many ways, he'll be irreplaceable â but he leaves behind a strong groundstaff team who will continue his work.

"We wish him all the best in his retirement, and we thank him for his tremendous service."

Gloucester ensured they will remain in with a shot at the play-offs going into the final round of the Premiership thanks to a 26-12 win at bottom side Newcastle.

The victory â Gloucester's first away since November in the league â moves them up a place to fifth, two points behind Bristol who were beaten by Sale.

Ben Stevenson's try got Newcastle on the front foot but Chris Harris, a penalty try and Seb Atkinson put Gloucester 21-5 up, before Jack Cotgreave sealed the crucial bonus point with a fourth try.

Replacement Joe Davis' stylish try capped a brilliant Stevenson run but the winger was shown a red card late on as Newcastle saw out the game with 14 men.

Gloucester must now beat Northampton Saints at home on 31 May and hope other results go their way to stand a chance of making the top four.

After a lacklustre performance against Harlequins six days earlier dented the Cherry and Whites' play-off hopes, director of rugby George Skivington said before kick-off that Gloucester's season was "on the line" at Kingston Park.

The early pressure was all from Newcastle, however. After two attempts at the Gloucester line came up short, they put the first points on the board with their third effort as neat build-up play from the soon-to-depart Callum Chick and Jamie Blamire helped Stevenson dive into the corner.

Gloucester's attack was repeatedly misfiring despite plenty of possession and it was not until 17 minutes they retaliated, as three quick passes from a line-out allowed Harris to touch down behind the posts.

Newcastle were their own worst enemy and went down to 13 men. Chick was sent to the sin-bin for a cynical challenge at the breakdown, and Cameron Neild followed two minutes later for collapsing a maul and a penalty try was given.

With two back-rowers missing, the gaps opened and from the restart Gloucester played straight out from the back.

Atkinson threw a dummy and made the break, before an exchange of passes with Tomos Williams resulted in Atkinson racing clear to make it 21-5.

Ben Stevenson scored a try, set up another, but was then shown a red card

Harris and Ruan Ackermann are among the 19 players confirmed to be leaving Gloucester this summer and the latter thought he had their bonus-point score when he charged down Sam Stuart's kick and sprinted over, only to see it scratched off for offside.

Harris was then shown yellow early in the second half but Newcastle could not capitalise, with Ackermann turning the ball over as they took a tap-and-go penalty within inches of the line.

After scoring his first Premiership try a week ago, 19-year-old winger Cotgreave had his second on his first league start, as he was picked out with a long ball from Atkinson.

Steve Diamond hailed his players' "remarkable" resilience earlier this week and Newcastle were far from down and out as Stevenson's searing run from deep inside his own half set up a sensational try that was finished off by Davis.

Freddie Lockwood was held up over the line, but Stevenson was then shown red for a dangerously mis-timed tackle that took out Santiago Carreras in the air, as the hosts fell to a 15th defeat this season.

Newcastle consultant director of rugby Steve Diamond told BBC Radio Newcastle: 

"I think we just had three, four minutes of madness in the first half - two yellow cards, conceded three tries, took the game away from us.

"I thought the lads did well to stick into it. Gloucester, a good team, fair play to them, they deserved the win.

"I was pleased with quite a lot of the performances, but we're that nearly team aren't we? That sums up our season: we could have done better, could have got more out of it, but we didn't.

"It's part of the learning curve we're on and hopefully that'll be one of the last losses we have here for a long time."

Gloucester director of rugby George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: 

"We got the five points we need. That was ultimately what we came up to do.

"It's never easy here, but their last home game with Chick, Blamire, those guys leaving - they're stalwarts of the club - we knew they'd be ferocious and that's what we got.

"The boys threw everything at it but we got the win.

"You should never underestimate winning a game like this with five points, especially under the pressure we are to deliver after last week."

It has been recently reported that Shields was a veteran member of Armagh's 2024 All-Ireland winning panel 

Armagh's Mark Shields admits coming out as a gay inter-county footballer was "daunting", but says it was "important to tell my own story" as he publicly discussed his sexuality for the first time. 

An All-Ireland winner with the Orchard County in 2024, Shields spoke about coming out in the GAA world at the Gaelic Players Association's annual Pride Brunch last weekend. 

Shields is the first active male inter-county player to speak about being gay since former Cork hurler Donal Og Cusack, while Kevin Penrose - who plays for Tyrone club Aghyaran - spoke about his experience on The GAA Social earlier this year.

Shields says he hopes his story will help young Gaelic games players who are struggling to express their sexuality.

"I feel it's just important to tell my own story of 12-15 years playing inter-county, my experience of coming through the ranks, being a senior inter-county player in the male GAA environment," said Shields in a video posted on the GPA's Instagram account.

"It was a daunting task coming out, whenever it was, about 10-12 years. The culture has changed within society, within the group in Armagh. I feel that I can express myself more. The group are more accepting.

"The language used around the group is changing. There's people standing up for people, for myself in the group, whereas maybe that didn't happen that much before. I think the culture is changing within the GAA itself."

Shields made his championship debut for Armagh in 2013

Whitecross club-man Shields says some of the language previously used in changing rooms was "hurtful", but that he feels more supported within the GAA now. 

"It's been excellent to have allyships and people advocating for it in social media, and around GAA set-ups, and the GPA," he said.

"I hope speaking out and telling my story will help that younger player, be it male or female, non-binary to express themselves in the GAA environment."

Shields added that speaking to his sister helped him before he came out. 

"I had to find someone I trusted in, that was my sister," he said.

"I spoke to my sister a lot, and would have a close relationship with her, my partner as well. It's finding that someone you trust and you want to express yourself to them.

"I found that very helpful whenever I was trying to tell my story and trying to come out. They were the ones that stood by me throughout and supported me whenever I felt down or low in the dumps or in a dark place.

"It doesn't have to be in front of a group; it can be a one-to-one conversation with someone. That's how I found it easier, to have that walk on the beach, in a forest or just chatting to someone over a coffee. That was the easiest way for myself."

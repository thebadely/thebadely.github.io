Match scorecard

Lancashire opener Gaby Lewis hit a sensational 141 not out off 143 balls to lead her team to a six-wicket victory in the One-Day Cup final against Hampshire.

Ireland captain Lewis batted all the way through the innings as Lancashire chased down their target of 289 with nine balls to spare.

She put on 144 with Seren Smale, who scored 72, and then had useful partnerships of 61 with captain Ellie Threlkeld and an unbroken 46 with Ailsa Lister to see the job through.

Hampshire's innings had been set up by 77 from captain Georgia Adams and Maia Bouchier's 66, but the team that finished top of the group stages came up short.

It was a third defeat in a final for a Hampshire side in nine days, after they lost in both the men's T20 Blast and One-Day Cup.

Hampshire had finished top of the eight-team group in this competition, with nine wins from 14 games, and a sparkling 107 not out from Adams had led them past Surrey to the final, played on their home ground.

Asked to bat first, Bouchier and Southby put on a fine 70 for the first wicket before the wicketkeeper fell for 35.

Bouchier hit the accelerator and had scored 66 off 59 balls when she tamely holed out to mid-on off Mahika Gaur.

It was a similar story for Freya Kemp in her run-a-ball 41 as she slashed slow left-armer Hannah Jones to short extra-cover.

And again for Adams, who could not match her semi-final century as she was dismissed in the 46th over. Without her, Hampshire could not pass the 300 barrier, having to settle for 288-6, with Grace Potts' 3-47 helping to keep the batting side in check.

Still, Lancashire needed to score at nearly six an over in their chase, and a mix-up between Lewis and fellow opener Alice Clarke saw Clarke run out with only 20 on the board.

But Lewis and Smale broke the back of the innings with their composed partnership, although they survived a couple of close run-out calls before Smale fell to a good diving catch by Kemp at short mid-wicket off Mary Taylor.

And when Fi Morris was run out for nine, Lancashire were 183-3 with the required rate at more than seven-and-a-half.

However, captain Ellie Threlkeld added real impetus with 32 off 30 balls in a partnership of 60 with Lewis, until she fell to Freya Davies.

But as long as Lewis was at the crease, Lancashire remained favourites. She reached her century from 121 balls before going on the charge to record her highest List-A score.

In partnership with Ailsa Lister, they added an unbroken 46 off just 28 balls to see Lancashire home as they lifted the second trophy of the season to go with victory in the T20 County Cup in May.

 

Lancashire captain Ellie Threlkeld told BBC Radio Lancashire:

"I feel quite emotional. I'm so, so proud of everyone.

"To put in a performance like that, to chase that down, to do it in the manner in which we did, and to play such incredible cricket all year, I'm so proud of all the girls.

"It's been such a team effort. It's pretty incredible really.

"It's been incredible to see the players grow from an individual point of view and as a team we've learned how to win, and winning's a habit.

"In the past we have probably learned how to lose, so it's nice that we've turned it round."

Let's dive into the details: Diakite has played 112 times for Lille and scored 13 goals during his three-year spell in northern France

Bournemouth have re-opened talks to sign Lille defender Bafode Diakite as Illia Zabarnyi nears a Â£55m move to Paris St-Germain.

The Cherries had previously walked away from talks with Lille over the Â£35m asking price for the 24-year-old centre-back.

But with PSG having broadly agreed to the fee of Â£55m for Ukraine international Zabarnyi - although negotiations are continuing over add-ons - Bournemouth are now back in the market for Diakite.

Sources close to Diakite say the former France Under-21 player has verbally agreed personal terms on a five-year deal, but negotiations between the clubs continue over the asking price.

Lille president Olivier Letang had previously been reluctant to sell Diakite but did not rule out the potential departure of a central defender when asked about it on Friday afternoon, answering "it's possible but only one".

Bournemouth are also keen on signing an additional central defender, with Dean Huijsen having joined Real Madrid in a Â£50m deal earlier this summer, and are open to signing an additional striker to provide competition for Evanilson. 

The south coast club are also known admirers of Chelsea defender Josh Acheampong and Sevilla centre-back Loic Bade.

PSG are hopeful of completing a deal to sign Zabarnyi in the next 48 hours as they are keen to get him in before the French season starts. 

All sides are confident of completing a deal, despite reported interest from Tottenham. 

PSG are also reported to have signed Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier for Â£35m - the French Treble winners are in a contract stand off with current number one Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Let's dive into the details: Keaton Jennings remains captain of Lancashire's T20 Blast team

This year's T20 Blast got under way with opening-night victories for troubled Lancashire Lightning and last season's semi-finalists Sussex Sharks. 

A day after the departure of head coach Dale Benkenstein following a bad start to the season, Lancashire secured a tense seven-run victory over Worcestershire Rapids at Emirates Old Trafford.

Captain Keaton Jennings led from the front in their North Group encounter as his side posted 176-8 with no Worcestershire batter going past 39 as they only made 169-7.  

In the South Group, Sussex began with a 16-run win at Lord's over Middlesex aided by a fine 77 not out from James Coles in their 202-4.

Despite 51 from Ben Geddes and some lusty hitting from Ryan Higgins, the home side never looked in contention as they ended on 186-7.

It has been a dreadful start to the season in the County Championship for Lancashire, who named former T20-winning captain Steven Croft as interim head coach, with no wins from their seven games.

Jennings had already resigned as red-ball captain and the club apologised to its members before Benkenstein's exit.

Back in charge for the T20 Blast, Jennings brought up his 50 off 30 balls and put on 79 for the first wicket with Luke Wells.

But a brilliant catch in the deep from Ethan Brookes removed Jennings and halted Lancashire's progress, and the hosts lost five wickets for 22 runs to keep the target to under nine runs an over.

When Kashif Ali smashed 39 off 21 balls, the Rapids were well over the required rate and on course for an away win.

But the loss of captain Brett D'Oliveira (30) and Adam Hose (13) to reduce Worcestershire to 93-4 after 10.1 overs changed the complexion of the game.

From there, Lancashire turned the screw and with the visitors needing 15 runs off the last over, Tom Aspinwall conceded just seven to deliver a morale-boosting first win of the season in any competition.       

James Coles' 77 not out for Sussex was only a third half-century in T20 cricket

Middlesex have been perennial strugglers in the South Group, unable to reach the quarter-finals for six years and without a Finals Day appearance since they won the competition in 2008.

After winning the toss, they chipped away at Sussex's top order, helped by Tom Helm running out Daniel Hughes at the non-striker's end when the Australian was well set on 38.

But Coles' best T20 score from 44 balls held the innings together as he put on an unbroken 88 with Tom Clark (26 not out) to take the score past 200.

New Zealand star Kane Williamson, on his Middlesex debut, was spectacularly caught for 14 at deep point by a diving Harrison Ward, who almost lost his trousers in the process.   

However, they were soon behind the required rate and at 136-5 early in the 17th over, the game looked over.

Higgins hit 44 off just 16 balls to give them a glimmer of hope until he was bowled by Ollie Robinson in the last over as the England bowler finished with an impressive 3-27.

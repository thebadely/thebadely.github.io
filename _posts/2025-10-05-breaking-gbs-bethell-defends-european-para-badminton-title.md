Let's dive into the details: Dan Bethell won Paralympic silver in Tokyo (2021) and Paris (2024)

Dan Bethell claimed his fifth European men's singles title in Istanbul as part of a successful European Para Badminton Championships for the Great Britain team. 

The defending champion once again met Oleksandr Chyrkov in the SL3 final, after beating the Ukrainian in Rotterdam to claim the crown two years ago, and this time saw out a 21-9 21-8 win. 

The British team claimed 13 medals in total, including three gold, two silver and eight bronze, which are awarded to players who reach the semi-finals but fail to progress.

"To see so many pathway players performing alongside the GB players is fantastic and shows how much the sport is developing across the country," double Paralympic silver medallist Bethell, 29, told Badminton England.

"There's been some amazing performances and victories across the board."

Englishman Jack Shephard reached the final of the men's SH6 singles but was unable to defend his title, losing 21-17 21-12 to France's reigning Paralympic champion Charles Noakes. 

But Shephard, 28, did win gold in the mixed doubles alongside 17-year-old compatriot Anya Butterworth, who stepped in after Shephard's regular partner Rachel Choong sustained an injury before the tournament.   

Butterworth also upset the odds to reach her first European singles final, beating second seed Daria Bujnicka in the last four, but had to settle for silver after losing a tight medal match 23-21 18-21 21-11 against Polish top seed Oliwia Szmigiel. 

Meanwhile, England's Krysten Coombs teamed up with men's singles champion Noakes to win gold in the SH6 men's doubles.

Scot Andrew Davies claimed bronze medals in both the men's and mixed doubles in the SH6 category, while Wales' David Jack Wilson and Englishman Robert Donald finished with bronze in the men's SU5 singles. 

Other British players to win bronze include Emma Louise Stoner (SL4 women's singles), David Follett (WH1/2 mixed doubles), Curnow Pirbhai-Clarke and William Smith (both SL3/4 men's doubles).

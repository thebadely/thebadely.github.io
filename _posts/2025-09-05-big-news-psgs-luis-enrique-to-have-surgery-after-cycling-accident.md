Let's dive into the details: Luis Enrique has also managed Roma, Celta Vigo, Barcelona and Spain

Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique will have surgery after being involved in a cycling accident on Friday. 

The 55-year-old, who led the French club to their first Champions League title last season, suffered a fractured collarbone in the accident, his club said. 

"The club expresses its full support and wishes him a swift recovery. Further updates will be shared in due course," PSG said. 

Luis Enrique was in the dugout as PSG defeated Toulouse 6-3 in Ligue 1 on 30 August, with Portuguese midfield Joao Neves scoring a hat-trick in their last game before the international break. 

The Parisians are set to face Lens on 14 September in their next league fixture before they begin their Champions League defence against Atalanta in the league phase three days later.

Luis Enrique joined PSG in 2023 and has won two league titles, two French Cups and the Champions League and also guided them to the Fifa Club World Cup final in July.

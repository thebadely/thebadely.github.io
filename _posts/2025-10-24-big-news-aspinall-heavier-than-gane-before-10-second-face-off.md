Aspinall heavier than Gane at weigh-in

UFC 321: Tom Aspinall v Ciryl Gane

Venue: Etihad Arena, Abu Dhabi Date: Saturday, 25 October

Coverage: Follow live text commentary from 20:00 BST on BBC Sport website and app.

Tom Aspinall was cheered by fans as he weighed in heavier than Ciryl Gane before the pair's heavyweight title fight at UFC 321 in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Manchester's Aspinall weighed 255lb (18st 3lb), which was 7.5lb heavier than Frenchman Gane's 247.5lb (17st 9.5lb).

While the 32-year-old was serenaded by "Tommy Aspinall" chants throughout, Gane was greeted by boos as he stepped on the scales.

The pair continued to show respect to each other during a rapid 10-second face-off, as they have throughout fight week, by ending it with a smile towards each other.

Aspinall, who was pumped up in front of fans at the Etihad Arena, is making the first defence of his undisputed heavyweight title since being upgraded from interim champion in June.

"This is going to be a very special performance guys, make sure you tune in, this is big," he said.

Gane was his usual calm self and appeared unbothered by the boos, before delivering a short message.

"Very glad to be here guys, see you Saturday, thank you," he said.

What UFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall eats in a day

Aspinall spent 19 months as the interim title holder, waiting for an undisputed fight with previous champion Jon Jones to materialise, before the American retired.

Gane, 35, is a former UFC heavyweight interim champion but has lost twice in bouts for the undisputed belt - firstly against Francis Ngannou in 2022, and against Jones the following year.

He is ranked first in the UFC's heavyweight rankings and is on a two-fight win streak, last earning a razor-thin split decision win over Alexander Volkov in December.

Aspinall last fought 15 months ago when he knocked out Curtis Blaydes in the first round to retain his interim title.

Aspinall has never gone the distance in any fight in his MMA career

There's no malice between Aspinall and Gane and the pair have shown a lot of respect to each other throughout fight week.

For the Briton, the contest represents an opportunity to finally move on with his career after spending months waiting on Jones.

There is a feeling among pundits and fans that Gane represents the toughest test in the division, and if Aspinall can win, there is a real chance for him to go on a history-making run at heavyweight.

Stipe Miocic holds the record for the most consecutive title defences in the division with three.

For Gane, the bout likely represents his final chance at becoming undisputed champion after coming up short twice before.

Much has been made of Aspinall prioritising training cardio in the build-up to the fight, with the expectation Gane could take it into the latter rounds.

The Frenchman's footwork and elusiveness is his strength, but there is a feeling if Aspinall can close the distance, the match-up will favour the Briton.

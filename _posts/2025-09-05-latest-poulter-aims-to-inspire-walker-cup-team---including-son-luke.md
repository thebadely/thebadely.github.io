Experts revealed that Luke Poulter has caddied for his father Ian in pro-am tournaments

If there is one surname to strike fear into American golf it is surely "Poulter" with Ian having been at the centre of so much European success on a biennial basis.

Now it is the turn of the Ryder Cup legend's 21-year-old son Luke to try to do something similar and thwart US hopes of retaining the Walker Cup at Cypress Point in California this weekend.

Fresh from starring in Great Britain & Ireland's victory over Continental Europe in the St Andrews Trophy, Poulter makes his debut in the 50th Walker Cup as GB&I seek an away win for only the third time.

Who better to inspire upsetting the form book than someone with the genes of Poulter Snr, whose heroics helped Europe complete the 'Miracle at Medinah' when they came from 10-4 down to win the 2012 Ryder Cup?

Ian Poulter will be supporting his son over the two days of competition having shared dinner with him and his nine team-mates earlier in the week.

"Being able to talk to him about the Ryder Cup and his experiences, having the chance to ask him questions and what it means and how to play these events, how to deal with the pressure has been so important," said Tyler Weaver, GB&I's highest ranked player.

Team-mate Niall Shiels Donegan, who beat Luke Poulter at the recent US Amateur Championship, added: "Dinner with Ian was really special.

"Obviously he's done a lot in team golf, and it was pretty cool to get some lessons from him."

Luke, who won three-and-a-half points out of four at the St Andrews Trophy, says he will try to use his father's exploits in the Ryder Cup - 15 wins from 25 matches between 2004 and 2021- as a motivating force.

"He never played a Walker Cup but he obviously has Ryder Cup knowledge, which is pretty similar to this," said the younger Poulter, who had a hole-in-one at Cypress Point's par-three third in Thursday practice.

"It's amazing to see (his achievements). It gives me inspiration to try and follow in his footsteps."

Having climbed to 27th in the amateur world rankings, the University of Florida student has already demonstrated many of his father's golfing traits. It is also clear they share the same "never say die" attitude.

"I just like that head-to-head battle because it's just you and the opponent on the golf course," he told the R&A website. "You don't have to think about anything, you just go hole by hole and try and beat them.

"And then with the team stuff, it's just really cool. I just love when everyone's supporting you and everyone's pulling for you."

GB&I lost a tight contest at St Andrews two years ago and the Walker Cup will again be staged at an iconic venue this weekend. Cypress Point was designed by Alister Mackenzie, the architect who laid out the Augusta National, home of the Masters.

For Shiels Donegan there is a degree of familiarity. The son of Scottish parents grew up near San Francisco and received vociferous local support during his run to the US Amateur semi-finals at the city's Olympic Club.

"I'm fortunate to have grown up not too far from here, a few hours north, so I hope that they'll come out in force again and have some more fun," he said.

"Having grown up on the poa greens, it does give me a little bit of extra feel, but of course they're going to be running firm and fast for everyone.

"You're going to have to adapt to the conditions as you see them, and yeah, just do your best that you can."

GB&I's most recent win came at Royal Lytham and St Annes in 2015. Their last away victory was at Sea Island in Georgia 24 years ago.

So the Americans are firm favourites to retain the trophy, but their captain Nathan Smith is taking nothing for granted. "I think this is one of their best teams that I've seen in a while," he said.

"I think the matches are always close, and it's going to be a big test for us this week."

Smith's team is stacked with talent. It includes the top six in the amateur world rankings; Jackson Koivan, Ben James, Ethan Fang, Jase Summy, Preston Stout and Tommy Morrison.

GB&I captain Dean Robertson has been taking a measured approach to the week, pacing his players' preparations. He will be encouraged by the recent form of Scot Cameron Adam, who finished in the top 20 at the recent British Masters.

Robertson knows this weekend has to be a collective effort with an astute game plan. "The key messages we've had have been strategy number one," the Scottish skipper revealed.

"Approach play, short iron approach play and specific distances where you need to position the ball under hole high have been things that we've been working on for a good number of weeks.

"Also, through developing the relationship and understanding of these players and the respect of them, we've really managed to bring them together, and there's a real unity there.

"I'm really thrilled to be their captain, really proud, and I'm really excited for the match itself."

There are 26 points up for grabs with GB&I needing 13Â½ points to regain the title, while the US need 13 to retain.

The contest will be made up of four foursome matches on each morning, with eight singles games on Saturday afternoon and 10 singles after lunch on Sunday.

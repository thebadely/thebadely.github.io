According to new developments, Cold weather payments have been triggered across 451 postcodes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as temperatures plunged across the UK. 

Households on certain benefits are entitled to the money when there is a prolonged period of below-zero temperatures.

In Scotland, those on low incomes and benefits may receive a separate winter heating payment, which does not depend on how cold it gets. 

The cold weather payment is a government benefit top-up to help with fuel bills.

The average temperature in a local area must be recorded as, or forecast to be, 0C or below for seven days in a row.

The temperature is recorded by the weather station nearest to your postcode.

More than 1.4 million cold weather payments worth £35m were made during winter 2024-25. Of this, more than £9m was issued to those in receipt of pension credit.

To qualify, you must live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.

Payments are not age-related but you must already be receiving certain benefits, including:

Each cold weather payment is for a seven-day period and is worth £25.

More than one payment will be made during the course of the winter if there are enough periods of cold weather.

The scheme runs between 1 November and 31 March each year.

Hospital stays can affect your entitlement to the payment so you should tell the Pension Service or Jobcentre Plus if you become an inpatient. 

You should also update the relevant service if you have a baby, or if a child under five comes to live with you.

In Scotland, the winter heating payment is worth £59.75, and is paid automatically between December and February. 

You do not have to do anything in order to receive cold weather payments.

The money should be paid automatically into the same bank or building society account as your benefits, within two weeks of the qualifying period of cold weather.

If you do not receive a payment, you can contact the Pension Service or Jobcentre Plus.

Cold weather payments do not affect other benefits.

They are separate to the winter fuel payment, which is worth £100 or £300 depending on your individual circumstances. 

About nine million pensioners will get the Winter Fuel Payment in 2025/2026, after a government U-turn over changes to the eligibility rules.

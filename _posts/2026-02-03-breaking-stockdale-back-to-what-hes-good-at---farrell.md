According to new developments, Jacob Stockdale has scored 19 Test tries across 40 Ireland caps

Ireland head coach Andy Farrell says Jacob Stockdale "deserves" to start against France in the Six Nations opener in Paris on Thursday night (20:10 GMT).

The 29-year-old wing, who was player of the championship in 2018, will appear in the competition for the first time since facing England in 2021.

Leinster's James Lowe has been first-choice in the position for the majority of the games since then, but has struggled to find his best form since returning from the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia last summer.

"There's always a debate to be had and Jacob deserves it," said Farrell of the selection.

"He's back to being himself this year, that's for sure. If you speak to him, he's delighted that he's simplified things and got back to what he's good at, which is beating people. We've seen that plenty this season."

With Stockdale selected on the left wing, Jamie Osborne gets the nod at full-back.

Usual number 15 Hugo Keenan misses out with a broken thumb sustained in training last week, with Osborne coming in despite having played no rugby since Ireland's win over Japan in November because of a shoulder problem.

"Knowing his temperament and how diligent he is in his preparation - which is top drawer by the way - there's no better man," said Farrell of Osborne's readiness for a first game in three months. 

"Jacob [Stockdale] is playing well, he deserves his chance on the left wing. Hugo has been unbelievably unlucky. He was looking sharp coming back in and I really feel for him to have the thumb injury.

"You look at the likes of Jimmy O'Brien or Mack Hansen or others [without Keenan] and Jamie is the one who is going to fill the spot for us. He's had a shoulder injury so he's fit, he's certainly showed that in the last week."

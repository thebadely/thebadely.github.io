Let's dive into the details: Enhanced Games organisers said swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev set a 'world record' in the 50m freestyle in a time trial in February

World Aquatics has become the first international federation to ban athletes, coaches and officials from its events if they have taken part in the controversial Enhanced Games.

The new event promotes banned performance-enhancing drugs and the inaugural Enhanced Games are scheduled to take place in Las Vegas from 21-24 May 2026.

There are plans for it to be an annual competition, initially comprising short-distance swimming, sprinting and weightlifting.

Last month, Enhanced Games organisers said Greece's Kristian Gkolomeev swam 20.89 seconds in a 50m freestyle time trial in the US in February, 0.02 seconds quicker than the world record set by Brazil's Cesar Cielo in 2009.

World Aquatics said it has introduced a new bylaw "that reinforces its steadfast commitment to clean sport".

It added: "Under the new bylaw, individuals who support, endorse, or participate in sporting events that embrace the use of scientific advancements or other practices that may include prohibited substances and/or prohibited methods will not be eligible to hold positions with World Aquatics or to participate in any World Aquatics competitions, events, or other activities. 

"This ineligibility would apply to roles such as athlete, coach, team official, administrator, medical support staff, or government representative."

BBC Sport has approached the Enhanced Games for comment.

World Aquatics said it also encouraged its member associations to "adopt similar policies at the national level to uphold consistent standards across the sport".

The Enhanced Games has been criticised for endangering athletes' health and undermining fair play, with the World Anti-Doping Agency describing it as a "dangerous and irresponsible project"., external

However, it has also attracted heavyweight backing from a venture capital fund headed up by Donald Trump Jr, the US president's son, and billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel.

"Those who enable doped sport are not welcome at World Aquatics or our events," said World Aquatics president Husain al Musallam. 

"This new bylaw ensures that we can continue to protect the integrity of our competitions, the health and safety of our athletes, and the credibility of the global aquatics community."

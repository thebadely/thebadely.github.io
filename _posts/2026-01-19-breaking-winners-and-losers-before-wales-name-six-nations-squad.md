Let's dive into the details: Steve Tandy is weighing up his options for his first Six Nations as Wales boss

Strong performances against European opposition at club level could help several Wales hopefuls get the chance to do the same in the Six Nations.

Dragons joined Cardiff and Ospreys in qualifying for the last 16 of the Challenge Cup over the weekend.

But as well as striving to reach the knockout stages and attempting to earn home advantage, it was the last chance for players to impress Wales boss Steve Tandy before he names his first Six Nations squad on Tuesday. 

There are a number of Test regulars who are odds-on for the opener against England on 7 February but BBC Sport Wales takes a look at the winners and losers before Tandy's big selection.

WRU accused of 'scaremongering' in clubs dispute

Having been a Test regular since his debut in 2022, Rio Dyer was overlooked by Warren Gatland for last year's Six Nations.

The Dragons wing was recalled by Tandy for the autumn series, featuring against South Africa, and has been in fine form since.

His double against Newcastle Red Bulls took his record to four tries in five games as well as providing assists.

The 26-year-old has his confidence back and is finishing impressively, beating defenders, running strong lines and hunting work.

If Tandy follows Bristol's lead by moving Louis Rees-Zammit to full-back, it could open space for the 24-cap wing.

"Rio's got that X factor and when he is confident, he means business," said Dragons captain Angus O'Brien.

"That's what we need â beating people in one v ones and lighting things up."

Full-back O'Brien is in similarly fine form but might have missed the international boat at 31.

However, Dragons also have a pair of promising prospects in flanker Ryan Woodman and scrum-half Che Hope.

Hooker Brodie Coghlan became an international in the autumn and, after returning from a hand injury, is fighting to be Dewi Lake's back-up along with Liam Belcher, Ryan Elias and Evan Lloyd.

Owen Watkin missed almost the entire 2025 through injury

Ospreys may have lost to Montpellier but there were strong try-scoring showings from centre Owen Watkin and back-row Ross Moriarty.

Watkin returned in December after 10 months out having ruptured knee ligaments in the opening game of last year's Six Nations in Paris.

The 29-year-old has worn both 12 and 13 for Ospreys and there is an opening at outside centre with Max Llewellyn sidelined by a knee injury.

"Owen has been really good on both sides of the ball," said Ospreys head coach Mark Jones.

"He scored a nice try against Montpellier and he is one of the best defenders in the URC in terms of the defensive reads and the line speed he brings.

"He makes a big difference to our team and is doing a lot of good work by sharing his knowledge with young players."

Moriarty returned to Wales last summer after a spell in France with Brive and could be a physical, abrasive and experienced option, albeit in an area of strength for Tandy.

The 31-year-old won the most recent of his 54 caps back in March 2022 but has not given up playing for Wales again.

Jones added: "It depends on how Wales want to go about building for the World Cup but you need experienced players around young players. Ross has a lot to offer."

Kane James won the 2024 World Rugby U20 Championship with England

There was a cruel injury blow for Exeter Chiefs number eight Kane James, who may be a World Rugby U20 Championship winner with England but is on Tandy's radar.

The 20-year-old from Haverfordwest played junior rugby with St Peters in Cardiff.

He has been mentioned as a potential bolter for the Six Nations but injured his ankle just 12 minutes into the Challenge Cup win against Cardiff.

James' hopes of a Six Nations call - for Wales or England - may hinge on a scan but Exeter coach Haydn Thomas believes the back-rower has the quality.

"He is an exceptional talent and there is a lot to love about Kane," said Thomas.

"The important thing is to enjoy his rugby and play the best he can for Exeter first and foremost because what happens after that will be a result of what he does with Chiefs."

Few in Cardiff colours gave Tandy a late nudge in Exeter but Mason Grady, Corey Domachowski and James Botham have all returned from injury after missing the autumn internationals.

Even at the age of 34, Jake Ball has been tipped to add physicality to the Wales pack after returning to Scarlets.

So it was a blow for club and country when the lock was forced off in the opening stages at Northampton Saints with a head injury.

Ball could yet be given the all-clear and, in the meantime, his teammates delivered a battling display at Franklin's Gardens, particularly flanker Josh Macleod - injured before the autumn series - hooker Elias and wing Ellis Mee.

It remains to be seen how many specialist fly-halves Tandy will select given Cardiff's Ben Thomas and Scarlets' Joe Hawkins can slot in at 10.

Tandy used Dan Edwards and Jarrod Evans in the autumn but Sam Costelow delivered a composed performance on a timely return from injury on Sunday, while Cardiff's Callum Sheedy is also in the mix.

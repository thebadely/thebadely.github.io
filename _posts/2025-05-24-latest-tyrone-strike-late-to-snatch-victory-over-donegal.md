Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Conor O'Donnell in action against Seanie O'Donnell in the Ulster derby at Ballybofey

Tyrone struck late in Ballybofey to snatch a 2-17 to 0-20 win over Donegal in Group One of the All-Ireland SFC round-robin series on Saturday.

Ulster champions Donegal led with eight to play, but Tyrone responded to get level and Peter Harte cracked over a sublime two-pointer to inspire his team to victory and end Jim McGuinness' perfect record as Donegal manager at MacCumhaill Park.

This was a game which swung this way and that, but two first-half goals from Seanie O'Donnell - one of four late changes to the Tyrone team - helped the Red Hands into the lead at the break.

In tricky conditions, it was Michael Langan and Michael Murphy who carried much of the fight for the hosts, with Langan hitting seven points from play and Murphy eight in total, including three two-point frees.

Donegal enjoyed a good start with a couple of early scores, but Tyrone hit back with the first of O'Donnell's goals in the eighth minute when he was quickest to react to Michael McKernan's dropping shot.

The second goal came seven minutes later as Conn Kilpatrick put O'Donnell through and he thumped low past Gavin Mulreany - a late change for the injured Shaun Patton.

Tyrone led by five, but Donegal ate into the lead with a couple of two-point frees from Michael Murphy, helping them draw level, but Darren McCurry hit back with one of his own at the other end as Tyrone led 2-7 to 0-11 at the end of the opening half.

The second half was a slow burner as the sides swapped points before Darren McCurry, who became increasingly influential and finished with 0-7 to his name, hit three on the spin to push the gap out to five, but two-pointers from Murphy and Langan brought Donegal back in before Langan levelled.

They were level heading into the final straight when Donegal captain, Patrick McBrearty, was sprung from the bench to land a two-pointer.

But Tyrone didn't panic and got themselves back on terms before that inspirational two-pointer from Harte. 

They managed to drain the clock with Cormac Quinn kicking the insurance late on to seal a huge win as they get ready for the visit of Mayo to Omagh next week, while Donegal will seek to bounce back when they head to Cavan for another Ulster derby.

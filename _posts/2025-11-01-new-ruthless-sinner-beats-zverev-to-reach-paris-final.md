According to new developments, Jannik Sinner has won five titles this year, including two Grand Slams

A ruthless Jannik Sinner took apart Alexander Zverev to reach the Paris Masters final and move within one win of regaining the world number one ranking.

Italy's Sinner did not let up in a 6-0 6-1 victory over world number three Zverev, who was listless throughout.

Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Sinner is on a 25-match winning streak on indoor hard courts.

He will face Felix Auger-Aliassime in Sunday's final - and victory would see the Italian replace Carlos Alcaraz at the top of the rankings.

"I'm very happy for Felix - he's one of the nicest guys we have on tour," the 24-year-old said.

"Sharing the final with him is going to be something special."

Sinner beat Zverev in a closely-contested final in Vienna six days ago, but the German was nowhere near his best in Paris.

Having saved two match points in a lengthy quarter-final win over Daniil Medvedev on Friday, Zverev looked fatigued from the first point.

He lost the opening set inside 30 minutes and did not hold serve until the first game of the second - and even then he had to save a break point.

Sinner was imperious though, hitting eight aces, winning 90% of first serve points and not facing a single break point.

He will bid for a fifth title of the year when he faces Auger-Aliassime, who earlier beat Alexander Bublik 7-6 (7-3) 6-4.

In the men's doubles, Britain's Henry Patten and Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara reached the final with a 6-3 6-4 win over French pair Quentin Halys and Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

According to new developments, Ben Davies (right) played with Gareth Bale at three major tournaments for Wales

Ben Davies says he has Gareth Bale's Wales cap record in his sights after chalking up a century of appearances for his country during the recent international break.

The 32-year-old defender became the fourth male player - after Bale, Wayne Hennessey and Chris Gunter - to reach the 100-cap mark for Wales when captaining his side in their 4-2 World Cup qualifying loss to Belgium on 13 October.

But he now hopes to surpass the men's record set by former Tottenham Hotspur team-mate Bale - who collected 111 caps before retiring after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

"It's definitely a target that's in sight," Davies told the Feast of Football podcast.

Neath-born Davies admitted he always had targets in a Wales jersey.

"The first one was to get a cap, then you start to look up and see what's in front of you," he said.

"I got around the 15 to 20 mark where I felt a bit more established, then I had the 50 one in my sights for a while.

"Your targets keep moving on. All the time, you have that 100 one in line and I guess the next step is to try and get to 112."

However, the Premier League veteran, who made his Wales debut in 2012, added: 

"As far as I'm concerned, it's not about those personal milestones, I still just want Wales to do well more than anything and if I can contribute to that then all the better."

Davies has been a pivotal figure for Wales under Craig Bellamy and is the only player to feature in all 14 of the current national head coach's matches.

And the left-back feels Wales are blessed to have his former international team-mate in charge.

"The biggest thing is the standards he sets. I remember as a player, when you talk about intimidating figures in the dressing room, he was definitely one," Davies said of Bellamy.

"You'd expect him to be on your case, you'd have to perform in training, you'd have to be on time, because if you weren't, he'd let you know."

Davies considers Bellamy one of the best captains, and now manager, he has played under.

"It was intense and hard, but you knew the levels you had to reach. I expected nothing different as a coach and he's probably surpassed all expectations that I had. He's been brilliant so far. 

"We've got a really talented manager and someone who I think within Welsh football we're very lucky to have where he is now because he can go on to do bigger and better things."

Ben Davies joined Tottenham from Swansea in 2014

Despite his importance on the international stage, Davies is yet to play a single minute of competitive action under Spurs boss Thomas Frank this season.

He was also dealt a blow on the night he earned his 100th Wales cap, forced off the pitch in the second half against Belgium with a hamstring injury.

But the Swansea City academy product - whose contract with the north London side expires next summer - believes he still has a part to play at Spurs.

"It's part and parcel of football," Davies said.

"I've been here 11 years now and this really is the first stint I've had where I haven't played many games. So it's not a bad run at such a top club.

"Things change pretty quickly in the world of football. It's not ideal, it's not where I want to be, every player wants to play games.

"It's where I'm at right now, it doesn't mean it's going to stay that way. As far as I'm concerned, head down, keep working hard and I'm sure I'll get my games in when they come."

Experts revealed that EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick has been suspended by the BBC after using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of Strictly Come Dancing.

The offensive remark was made last November during filming for the BBC dance show’s flagship Blackpool week, the Sun on Sunday reported.

The BBC said his language was “entirely unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we hold and expect”.

The newspaper said that Borthwick, who plays Jay Brown - a key long-running character on the soap - apologised for "any offence and upset". 

BBC News has approached his representatives for a comment.

Disability charity Scope said Borthwick should reflect on what he said and educate himself.

"We hope he takes the opportunity to get to know the reality of disabled people's lives,” said the organisation's media manager Warren Kirwan.

Borthwick is said to have made the offensive remark on a phone video while backstage during rehearsals at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom.

He reportedly used the term to describe the people of the seaside town.

In his statement to the Sun on Sunday, Borthwick said: "I want to apologise sincerely and wholeheartedly for the words I used in the video showing my reaction to making it through Blackpool week on Strictly.”

He added: "It is no excuse, but I did not fully understand the derogatory term I used and its meaning.

"That is on me completely.

"Now I am aware, I am deeply embarrassed to have used the term and directed it in the way I did."

Borthwick rose to fame for his portrayal of Jay Brown (previously Mitchell) in BBC soap EastEnders.

He has starred in it since 2006, making him one of the longest-serving actors on the show.

He has won a British Soap Award for best dramatic performance from a young actor, and an Inside Soap Award for best actor.

The 30-year-old took part in the latest series of Strictly, where he was paired with professional dancer Michelle Tsiakkas.

It marked a return to the ballroom for him, after he won the 2023 Christmas special.

He made it through to Blackpool week - seen as a key milestone in the contest - but was voted off later in November, making him the ninth celebrity to leave the show.

His offensive remark is the latest controversy to hit Strictly, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year.

Last month, former contestant and radio host Wynne Evans announced he was leaving his BBC Radio Wales show after the broadcaster "decided not to renew" his contract.

He had been taking time off his daytime show after apologising for making what he described as an "inappropriate and unacceptable" comment during the Strictly live tour launch in December.

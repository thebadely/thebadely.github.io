Here’s what you need to know: Thomas Tuchel has won nine of his first 10 games in charge of England - the only other England manager to pick up as many wins in his first 10 matches is Glenn Hoddle in 1996-97 (also W9 L1)

England completed a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign with victory in Albania, giving head coach Thomas Tuchel an outstanding record of eight wins from eight with 22 goals scored and none conceded.

It concludes phase one of the job Tuchel was brought in to do by the Football Association after succeeding Sir Gareth Southgate. Namely win the World Cup.

Tuchel's planning now moves to the next stage - so what are the major issues he must ponder before he names his World Cup squad as he looks to end a 60-year wait for a major men's trophy?

England's win over Albania saw Jude Bellingham start his first international since June

The rivalry between childhood friends Jude Bellingham and Morgan Rogers for England's number 10 jersey provides an intriguing sub-plot to Tuchel's World Cup build-up.

Tuchel stresses the battle can remain friendly, although it has almost been stoked and encouraged by the German, so keen is he to create edge and competition in his squad.

Along with Declan Rice, Rogers is the only other England player to feature in all 10 games under Tuchel.

Rogers took his chance impressively when Bellingham was absent after shoulder surgery, then Tuchel kept faith with Aston Villa's 23-year old after he decided against giving one of the global superstars in England's squad an instant recall.

After a 25-minute cameo as a substitute against Serbia at Wembley, Bellingham started in Tirana, delivering a bit of everything that makes him such a passionate point of discussion.

Bellingham showed his range of passing, made trademark driving runs, almost scored in the second half â but also demonstrated petulance when he was shown a yellow card for a foul committed after he lost possession, then looked unhappy at being substituted, which Tuchel said he will review.

The accomplished manner in which Rogers has taken to the England stage has given Tuchel a wonderful conundrum, while the searing heat at next summer's World Cup means he is likely to deploy "starters" and "finishers", Bellingham and Rogers can do both.

Rogers has an avid admirer in Tuchel. He has made 10 appearances under him, starting six games and playing for a total of 531 minutes. Bellingham has started four, playing 374 minutes in total.

Tuchel will not duck big decisions. He will not indulge in star systems or simply pack his team with the biggest names.

So who will start?

For all Rogers' impressive work, Bellingham has proved he can deliver game-changing moments at the highest level, his status also confirmed when Albania's Kristjan Asllani asked him to swap shirts at half-time rather than risk leaving it until the end.

Phil Foden will be in Tuchel's thinking, with the German saying he does not see the Manchester City forward as a winger, and instead "as a mix between a nine and a 10".

Chelsea's Cole Palmer also has the ability and class to force his way into the squad if he can recover from his groin injury.

In reality, however, it looks like a choice between Bellingham and Rogers.

Bellingham's greater experience of the rarefied air of major competitions will surely just give him the edge when Tuchel names his team for England's first World Cup game.

Harry Kane maintained his magnificent England record with the double in Albania that ensured they finished World Cup qualifying with a win.

Kane may be 32 but looks at his peak, a master marksman as well as the complete player, willing to drop deep to do dirty work but still always arriving at the sharp end with perfect timing when goals are required.

Former England defender Conor Coady told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I don't want to think of an England without Harry Kane. What he brings to this team is unbelievable.

"The way he keeps on producing these numbers is unbelievable and it is credit to him. He is the first on and last off the training pitch. He is our biggest hope going into next year."

Kane is indispensable, England's record scorer with 78 goals in 112 internationals.

If he is not playing the drop off is deep. Kane's potential deputies are all perfectly capable, but they are not Harry Kane.

An injury to his captain will be Tuchel's biggest fear, particularly as ready-made replacements are hardly forming an orderly queue.

Harry Kane has now scored 78 goals in 112 games for England

Brighton's 34-year-old veteran Danny Welbeck has been touted. It is testimony to the enduring skill of the striker, who last played for England seven years ago, but also suggests the cupboard is worryingly bare.

Tuchel said Welbeck was "very close" to a call-up for England's latest camp, but added: "I felt even without knowing him I know what he can give us. Do I really need to see this in November?"

Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins has been used, although Ivan Toney has disappeared from view after bizarrely being summoned from Saudi Arabia to play two minutes in the friendly against Senegal last June.

Marcus Rashford can play as a striker, while Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon has played there for his club, but is not a natural fit.

Foden has been mentioned as part of a tactical tweak if England are in need of a main striker, but the bottom line is they still have no-one who comes close to Kane's class.

As Coady stated, England without Harry Kane at the World Cup is unthinkable.

John Stones brings class, experience and versatility to England's defence - so will he start at the World Cup?

John Stones showed his class and versatility in a hybrid role in Tirana, ostensibly in his usual central defensive position but stepping into midfield when England were in possession. It is a ploy he can carry out with comfort, potentially giving Tuchel's strategy an extra dimension.

Former England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live: "This game against Albania is cementing why John Stones is so vital to this England squad. He is conducting the play from a centre-back position and a centre midfield position. Really impressive."

It is likely to be a more orthodox back four at the World Cup, so it looks down to two from Stones, Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa and Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi in central defence.

Stones may have the edge with his vast experience, while Konsa and Guehi, who both missed the win in Albania through injury, have grown as internationals.

Coady said: "I think it's really close. Konsa has been outstanding. For me, it's Stones and Guehi's to lose. To keep Stones fit for the World Cup is absolutely huge."

Bayer Leverkusen's Jarell Quansah made his long-awaited senior debut against Albania and impressed as he started centrally before moving out wide.

Tuchel must also decide on his left-back with an exciting trio of youngsters leading the race.

Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tottenham's Djed Spence and Manchester City's Nico O'Reilly have all been handed senior debuts by Tuchel, but it is O'Reilly who started and impressed in the final two qualifiers.

Newcastle United's Tino Livramento, currently out injured, may be in the lead for that place, with Lewis-Skelly left out by Tuchel because of lack of game time this season. O'Reilly may have edged ahead of Spence after this camp.

It is still a position up for grabs.

Marcus Rashford assisted Harry Kane seven minutes after coming on against Albania

Bukayo Saka has nailed down the right wing slot, so who will play on the opposite side?

Marcus Rashford left Tuchel with something to remember him by from England's World Cup qualifier with a superb cross for Kane's second goal in Tirana.

Rashford has made his case, but Gordon has also impressed, while Tuchel is a big fan of Arsenal's Noni Madueke, currently out injured.

Jack Grealish has done well on loan at Everton, but he simply has too much competition to fight his way past and has not featured for the Three Lions since October 2024.

Eberechi Eze started against Albania and can play on the left or as a number 10, though he is not at the forefront of the conversations to compete with Bellingham and Rogers in that role.

If Rashford wanted to give Tuchel food for thought, his superb cross for Kane to complete his double gave the head coach plenty to digest.

Experts revealed that Aryna Sabalenka reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in July

Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka fell to a 6-1 6-4 defeat by Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open.

The Kazakh dominated the opening set and racked up 11 aces against the world number one before sealing her victory in 74 minutes. 

"I'm happy with the serve. It was the key today," Rybakina said. 

"I served really well. If she had been serving well it would have been a totally different match. It was also intense from the baseline. I just hope to continue like this."

Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon winner, will now face this year's All England Club champion in the last four - as Iga Swiatek beat Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-4.

Poland's Swiatek, ranked third in the world, was always in charge against the Russian, who appeared hampered by a calf problem and saved four match points in the penultimate game.

However, Swiatek prevailed to move into her fourth WTA 1,000-level semi-final of the season.

"I just played my game. It was not easy but I'm happy that I stayed solid and kept my intensity," said the Pole.

French Open champion Coco Gauff is out after an error-strewn performance in her three-set loss to Italian Jasmine Paolini.

Gauff took the first set but hit 16 double faults, allowing Paolini to break her serve eight times on the way to a comeback 2-6 6-4 6-3 win.

Seventh seed Paolini, who overcame a twisted ankle in the third set, will face Veronika Kudermetova in the semi-finals.

Experts revealed that Downing Street is holding talks with backbench MPs about its planned changes to benefits, as it faces a growing rebellion ahead of a vote on Tuesday.

More than 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment calling for the proposals, affecting personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit (UC), to be scrapped. 

Ministers say the changes  would save £5bn a year by 2030.

Pip is paid to 3.7 million people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition in England and Wales, up from 2.1m in 2019.

There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.

The government plans to tighten daily living assessments. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says this will affect about 800,000 people.

Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe.

From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support across a broad range of tasks.

For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.

The payments for daily living are:

Payments for the mobility element - which are not affected - are:

Pip is usually paid every four weeks and is tax-free. It does not depend on someone's savings or income and does not affect other benefits, or the benefit cap. People can get Pip if they are working.

At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. That could be sooner if someone's circumstances change. 

The government plans more frequent reassessments. However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.

When the government published the final text of the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill on 18 June, it said anyone losing Pip will continue to receive the payment for a transition period of 13 weeks.

The government has also announced changes to universal credit (UC), which is paid to 7.5 million people across the UK. 

At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply. 

The basic level of universal credit is worth £400.14 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.

But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top-up worth £423.27.

Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.

New claimants will also see this top-up fall from £97 extra per week in 2025-26 to £50 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.

The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen.

At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise to £106 a week by 2029-30. 

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects 3.2 million families – a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the measures, with an average loss of £1,720 per year.

This includes: 

However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of £1bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work. 

In addition, the DWP said 3.8 million families will gain an average of £420 a year from the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process. 

The UC changes will apply across the whole of the UK. 

The Pip changes will apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

In Scotland, Pip is being phased out and replaced with a separate benefit called the Adult Disability Payment. However, although the new Pip rules won't apply, any reduction on spending on the benefit by Westminster would have a knock-on effect on the Scottish government's budget.

Dozens of Labour MPs have raised concerns about the bill's potential impact on disabled people, and fears that it could force tens of thousands of people and families with children into poverty. 

More than 160 MPs - including more than 120 from Labour - have signed an amendment that could trigger a vote to reject the bill in its entirety.  

The number of Labour MPs threatening to rebel could wipe out the government's majority. A vote on the bill is due to take place on Tuesday 1 July.

The government said it still wants to hold the vote, but acknowledged that getting the policy right was "not easy".

The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment.

It says it will invest £1bn in what it calls "high-quality, tailored and personalised support" to help people find jobs.

A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.

The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.

Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claima health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.

While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.

A new "right to try" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out. 

The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period. 

The government spends £65bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. The OBR has projected this to increase to £100bn by 2029.

Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to £34bn by 2029-30.

When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save £1.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, the number of claimants has risen.

The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be £72.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be £25.4bn.

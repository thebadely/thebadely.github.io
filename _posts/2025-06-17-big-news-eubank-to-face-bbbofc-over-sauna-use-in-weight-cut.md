I wasn't allowed to urinate - Eubank

Chris Eubank Jr will appear before the British Boxing Board of Control in July to answer questions about his use of a sauna before his fight with Conor Benn.

But the BBBofC have refused to "speculate" what punishment the Briton might face if he is found to have broken their rules.

Eubank, 35, beat Benn on points in their grudge match in April and the build-up was dominated by the weight discrepancy and rehydration clause.

Eubank missed weight and was fined Â£375,000, but was within the 10lb rehydration limit on the morning of the fight.

General secretary Robert Smith said the board had been made aware of the possibility Eubank used a sauna for his weight cut.

"We need to establish exactly what the situation is. I want to find out the dates when it was all done," Smith told BBC Sport. 

"He's been called in by the Southern Arena Council. He will come in at the beginning of July and tell them what the truth is and then they'll make a decision."

Saunas are banned by the BBBofC and last Saturday Adam Azim's opponent Eliot Chavez was pulled from the fight after he used a sauna to make weight.

Eubank posted several videos of what appeared a gruelling weight cut to middleweight (11st 6lb).

"Let's just see what the man has to say. There will be doctors there etc and the council will consider it and decide what action they need to take," Smith said. 

With the BBBofC facing questions about their sanctioning of the fight and Eubank alleging his weight cut was "derailed" deliberately, Smith - speaking to Boxing News, external - suggested Eubank "boxed as though he had no problems". 

"He was as strong in the last round as he was in the first round," Smith said.

"The medical documentation we [received] since the contest says he was fine."

Eubank spent two days in hospital after his fight with Benn.

The Englishman racked up Â£475,000 worth of penalties before his fight with Benn, with the board fining him Â£100,000 for slapping Benn with an egg.

The weight fine went straight to Benn, as stipulated in their fight contract.

The fight took place 35 years after their fathers, Chris Eubank Snr and Nigel Benn, fought in the 1990s.

BBC Sport has contacted Chris Eubank Jr for comment.

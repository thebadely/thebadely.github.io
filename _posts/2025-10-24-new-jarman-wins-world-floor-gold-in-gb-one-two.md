Brits Jake Jarman and Luke Whitehouse top floor in World Gymnastics Championships

Jake Jarman won gold at the the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships as Great Britain claimed a one-two finish in the men's floor final.

Jarman, who took the bronze medal in the event at the 2024 Paris Olympics, finished top with a score of 14.866 in Jakarta, Indonesia.

His compatriot Luke Whitehouse followed closely behind to come second with 14.666 to secure his first medal at a World Championships, having won the past three European titles on floor.

Olympic champion Carlos Yulo of the Philippines rounded off the podium, taking bronze with 14.533.

The previous world floor champion, Israel's Artem Dolgopyat, could not compete following Indonesia's decision to not grant visas to the Israel team because of the country's military offensive in Gaza.

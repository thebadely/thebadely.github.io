It has been recently reported that Luke Littler won the World Grand Prix event on Sunday

Reigning world champion Luke Littler has won the Players Championship 32 event to secure his place at next month's Players Championship Finals.

The 18-year-old was in superb form, hitting 10 180s and producing an average of 110.73 as he defeated Dutchman Dennie Olde Kalter 8-2 in the final at Robin Park Leisure Centre in Wigan.

"I'm really happy to come away with a win," said Littler, who averaged 102 across his seven matches on Wednesday.

"At the start of the day it was just about getting through the early stages, and you need to believe in yourself."

On his way to the final, Littler beat Dylan Slevin 6-4, Jeffrey de Graaf 6-4, Adam Lipscombe 6-0, Adam Hunt 6-4 and Rhys Griffin 6-3, before averaging more than 109 in a 7-4 semi-final victory over world number four Stephen Bunting.

Olde Kalter, 33, is in his first season on the PDC Tour after winning a spot via Q School and is ranked 140th in the world.

He defeated Marvin van Velzen 6-3, Niels Zonneveld 6-1, Dirk van Duijvenbode 6-5, Scott Waites 6-1, Nathan Aspinall 6-4 and Jermaine Wattimena 7-3 to reach his first PDC final.

Wattimena had won Players Championship 31 on Tuesday, beating Aspinall in the final.

There are 34 Players Championship events across the year, with the competition's finals held in Minehead, Somerset from 21-23 November, featuring the 64 best-performing players.

Littler began Wednesday 67th in the Players Championship standings, but has now done enough to reach the finals.

"I know I've got the capabilities to come from behind in matches and that's what I did yet again," added the teenager, speaking to the PDC website.

"Trying to qualify for Minehead was at the back of my mind. I had seen some people on social media say I wasn't going to make it, but I'm very happy with the way I played."

However, three-time world champion Michael van Gerwen, 36, will miss the finals for the first time. 

He is outside the top 64, withdrew from Wednesday's competition and will not be playing in the final two events in Wigan on 29 and 30 October.

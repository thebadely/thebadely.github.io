Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry faltered in their bid to win back-to-back Zurich Classic of New Orleans titles as American pair Andrew Novak and Ben Griffin claimed their first PGA Tour win. 

Starting the alternate-shot final round five shots off the lead, McIlroy and Lowry shot two-under 34 on the front nine, but stumbled with bogeys at 13, 15 and 17 after play resumed following a 90-minute weather delay. 

With a birdie on the last, McIlroy and Lowry carded a closing even-par 72 to finish in a tie for 12th.

As McIlroy, playing for the first time since winning the Masters, and Lowry faded on the back nine, a three-way battle emerged in the closing stages. 

Novak and Griffin, who held a three-shot lead after three rounds, finished strongly to clinch a one-shot win over Danish twins Nicolai and Rasmus Hojgaard. 

The overnight leaders were tied at -27 with another American pair in Jake Knapp and Frankie Capan III before a decisive two-shot swing on the par-three 17th. 

While Knapp and Capan III made bogey after finding water, Griffin holed a superb birdie putt from the back of the green to establish a two-stroke cushion with one hole left.

The Hojgaard brothers birdied the par-five 18th to card a four-under 68, but finished one shot shy as Novak and Griffin made par for a winning 71. 

It was a particularly satisfying victory for Novak, who lost to Justin Thomas in a play-off at last week's RBC Heritage.

Experts revealed that Paul Hughes chalked up his 14th victory with a super-quick victory in Belfast

Derry's Paul Hughes got back in the win column with an explosive 42-second knockout victory over Bruno Miranda in Belfast.

Hughes soaked up an electric atmosphere inside the SSE Arena before producing a performance that matched it.

The 28-year-old lightweight, who dropped Miranda with a huge left hand, said: "I wish it went on a little longer, I know people wanted to see a scrap, but what do you do? I just hit too hard.

"I made my professional debut in this arena over eight years ago and every single time I drove past it I said I am going to fight there [again] and my dream came true.

"We're a small country but we're dong big things on the world stage. I hope I represent you all well, because I am going to the top."

Fighting on home soil for the first time since 2019, Hughes might have felt the weight of a nation on his shoulders.

After a narrow defeat by former Bellator lightweight champion Usman Nurmagomedov in January, Hughes needed a big performance on home soil to stake his claim for a rematch.

But there was zero sign of nerves from Hughes, who wore a broad smile from the moment he emerged from backstage.

Hughes appeared alongside local musician Foy Vance, who sang a live version of the Dubliners 'Grace'.

The crowd sang the lyrics back to Hughes after relentlessly booing Miranda a few moments before.

Hughes entered the cage to 'Oles' nd there was no time for even a slight lull in atmosphere as Hughes took advantage of a lazy kick from Miranda by catching it and delivering his knockout blow.

As Miranda collapsed and Hughes unloaded, the referee stepped in to stop the contest.

"Usman Nurmagomedov, you can run and you can try delay this rematch as long as you want, but your day is coming," Hughes said in the aftermath.

Hughes improved his record to 14 wins and two losses and will consider himself in pole position to fight Nurmagomedov in the near future.

Manchester's McGrillen, fighting for the first time since winning the 2024 PFL Europe bantamweight tournament, produced a dominant performance to see off 32-year-old Philpott.

He capped the fight off with a rear-naked choke, to secure the first submission victory of his career.

McGrillen, 24, improved to 11 wins and one loss and had a simple message after his latest victory.

"Give me PFL Manchester," he said.

Let's dive into the details: India are hosting the Women's World Cup for the first time since 2013

The secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Devajit Saikia says there is no assurance that India and Pakistan players will shake hands when they play at the Women's World Cup on Sunday. 

During the recently-concluded men's Asia Cup, the teams played each other three times, including in the final which was won by India. 

In the first game, which was their first meeting since the conflict between the nations earlier this year, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson said India refused to shake hands.

The tension continued throughout and culminated with India not accepting the winners' trophy from Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.

"I cannot forecast anything, but our relationship with that particular hostile country is the same, there is no change in the last week," Saikia told BBC Stumped. 

"India will play that match against Pakistan in Colombo, and all cricket protocols will be followed. I can only assure that whatever is in the MCC regulations of cricket, that will be done.

"Whether there will be handshakes, whether there will be hugging, I cannot assure you of anything at this moment." 

Pakistan are based in Colombo, Sri Lanka for the entirety of the World Cup as the teams will only face each other at neutral venues and in global competitions. 

This policy was in place even before the four-day conflict in April which followed a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.

If Pakistan qualify for the semi-final or the final, they will also play their games in Colombo.

Co-hosts India and Sri Lanka opened the tournament in Guwahati on Tuesday, with India winning comfortably by 59 runs.

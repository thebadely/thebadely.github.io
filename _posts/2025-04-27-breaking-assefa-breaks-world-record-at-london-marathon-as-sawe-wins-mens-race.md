Assefa sets women's-only marathon world record

Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa surged to victory in the London Marathon in a world record for a women's only field, while Kenya's Sebastian Sawe triumphed in the men's race.

Olympic silver medallist Assefa burst clear of 2021 winner Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya with 10km to go before crossing the line in two hours 15 minutes 50 seconds.

Assefa beat the previous record, set by Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya in London last year, by 26 seconds.

Jepkosgei finished second, nearly three minutes behind, with 2023 winner and Olympic champion Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands third.

In the men's race, debutant Sawe kicked on with a little over 10km (6.21 miles) remaining and his rivals were unable to respond, with the Kenyan finishing in 2:02:27.

Half marathon world record holder Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda was over a minute down in second on his full marathon debut and 2024 winner Alexander Mutiso Munyao came third.

Great Britain's Mahamed Mahamed finished ninth, with Olympic triathlon champion Alex Yee in 14th.

Eilish McColgan was the leading Briton in the women's race on her marathon debut in a Scottish marathon record time of 2:24:25, beating Steph Twell's mark of 2:26:40 set in Frankfurt in 2019.

The Commonwealth 10,000m champion finished eighth, a place ahead of Rose Harvey.

It was a Swiss double in the wheelchair races for the second year running as Catherine Debrunner broke her own course record in the women's race and Marcel Hug stormed to his seventh victory in the men's.

A highly anticipated women's race was billed as another battle between Hassan and Assefa - the gold and silver medallists in Paris last summer.

The pair were among the lead group early on but by the 20km (12.5-mile) mark, Hassan was five seconds back with Assefa and Jepkosgei maintaining a relentless pace.

It looked set for a close finish but Assefa, the former outright world record holder, kicked for the line and from being neck-and-neck with Jepkosgei at 35km (just under 22 miles), she was 56 seconds ahead at 40km and held treble that advantage by the line.

"I won second here last year so to win this year is very special. I am really, very happy," Assefa told BBC One.

"Last year I did have some problems with the cold and my hamstring tightened up towards the end. This year the weather suited me better.

"I am really pleased with how the race went."

The field for the men's elite race was touted as the best ever in London and the lead group was still comprised of nine athletes after 30km (18.64 miles).

Sawe made his move just after the 31km (19.26 miles) mark and although the competition included Kiplimo, Mutiso, four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge and Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, none could match him.

The Kenyan stretched his lead and eventually crossed the line a minute and 10 seconds ahead of his nearest challengers.

"I am so happy. This is my fastest time for the London Marathon," he told BBC One.

"I was well prepared for this race and that is why it is an honour for me to have won."

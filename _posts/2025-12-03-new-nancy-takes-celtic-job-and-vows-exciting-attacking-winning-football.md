Here’s what you need to know: Wilfried Nancy has vowed to bring "exciting, attacking, winning football" after being confirmed as the new manager of Celtic on a two-and-a-half-year contract. 

The 48-year-old Frenchman will take charge on Thursday - replacing interim boss Martin O'Neill - after his protracted move from Major League Soccer club Columbus Crew was finally confirmed.

His first game in charge will be the top-of-the-table Scottish Premiership meeting with Hearts at Celtic Park on Sunday, followed by the Europa League visit of Roma and the League Cup final with St Mirren the next week.

"I can't wait to get going and become part of such a brilliant institution," Nancy said. 

"Celtic is one of the world's proper football clubs, real atmosphere and heart and soul, real high standards and real demands, which I am ready for. I know the history, I know the values of Celtic and I know what is expected of me on this journey.

"I know what Celtic means to so many people and my No. 1 aim will be simple - to give our fans a strong, exciting, attacking, winning football team they can be so proud of."

Celtic had been searching for a new manager since 27 October when Brendan Rodgers resigned and legendary former manager O'Neill stepped in as caretaker.

The Parkhead club have won every domestic match under O'Neill's stewardship, moving to within two points of Hearts and reaching the League Cup final.

"I want to thank the great Martin O'Neill and Shaun Maloney for all they have done in recent weeks with the team," Nancy added.

"These guys have given so much to the club across so many years and I know our fans, like me, all recognise the brilliant job they have done. 

"They have my total respect and my total gratitude. I hope to meet them both very soon and thank them personally."

After playing spells in his homeland, Nancy moved into coaching in Canada.

Following Thierry Henry's resignation as head coach in 2021, Nancy took over at Montreal and led them to the Canadian Championship later that year.

A move to Crew followed in 2022 and Nancy led the Ohio side to the MLS Cup in 2023 and the Leagues Cup, a competition between Mexican and United States sides, last year - when he was also named MLS coach of the year.

However, this year they finished seventh in Eastern Conference and 12th overall.

In all, he has overseen 215 games in North America and a move to Celtic would be his first managerial role in Europe.

'Mad scientist' & 'next Luis Enrique' - who is Nancy?

Chairman Peter Lawwell: "He is a manager with a record which demonstrates the kind of football which we know Celtic supporters love to see.

"I want to express our sincere thanks to Martin, Shaun and our backroom team. They have done such a tremendous job in stabilising the team and restoring a real level of confidence, with some fantastic results domestically and in Europe."

Chief executive Michael Nicholson: "We have been aware of Wilfried and his quality of work for some time - he was our number one candidate when we began the process and we are delighted that he as agreed to join the club.

"I know he is hugely excited about this opportunity to be part of Celtic's future. We will give Wilfried every support to face the challenges ahead, with our aim as always being to deliver the success for the club which our supporters deserve."

Principal shareholder Dermot Desmond: "We believe we have brought a hugely talented manager to the club. He is a man who absolutely understands the demands at Celtic, he is a man of real humility but also someone with his own ideas, his own vision and such a personal drive and desire to do well.

"I will always hold Martin in such high regard for what he has done for Celtic and for what he is as a man â a man of such professionalism and integrity and someone who undoubtedly will always have the best interests of Celtic in his heart."

Paul: Big thank you to Martin O'Neill from all Celtic fans. He's done a terrific job and we could not have asked for any more. He's an absolute legend. Wilfried Nancy has big shoes to fill. Hopefully he seeks out Martin at some point in the next few days to ask for his opinions to seek the best way forward for our club.

Catherine: I'm going to be sad to see O'Neill's last game. Big shoes the new manager has to fill.

Joss: The new Celtic boss will soon learn that managing in Glasgow is not for the faint hearted. Time will tell if he can handle the madness... it always does.

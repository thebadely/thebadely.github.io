Let's dive into the details: Rain and wind warnings have come into force across parts of the UK as Storm Benjamin bears down on the country.

Commuters have been warned of heavy rain and winds of up to 70mph (112km/h)  on Thursday.

Power cuts, localised flooding, building damage, and travel disruptions are possible, according to the Met Office.

The four yellow weather warnings cover large swathes of southern and eastern England and Wales as Storm Benjamin, named by the French weather service Météo France, moves from the English Channel to the North Sea throughout the day.

A yellow warning for rain covering most of southern England, the East Midlands, parts of Wales and Yorkshire is in place until 18:00 BST, with some places expected to see up to 30-50mm.

In the 24 hours leading up to 03:00, the south-east coast had experienced the most rain, with Pevensey in East Sussex recording 40mm. 

A yellow warning for rain for most of East Anglia and Lincolnshire is in effect until 21:00, with a yellow wind warning also in force for those areas and much of south-east England until midnight.

Strong winds were expected to develop across Kent and Sussex, with 65-70mph gusts "possible near coasts", the Met Office said.

Late-morning or early afternoon wind gusts above 70mph could develop for a small period of time along the North Sea coast.

A yellow wind warning was also in place for the south-west, including Cornwall and Devon, and west Wales from 06:00 BST until 15:00 BST.

North-westerly winds gusting up to 55mph in both areas are possible, while some coastal areas could be hit with 60mph gusts.

More severe rain and winds are set to batter western Europe, including France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

The Europa League has confirmed two matches scheduled for Thursday have had their kick-off times brought forward.

Dutch side Feyenoord will play Greece's Panathinaikos in Rotterdam two hours and 15 minutes earlier than scheduled at 16:30 local time (15:30 BST), it said. 

Uefa also announced Thursday's Conference League match between Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and ŠK Slovan Bratislava had been brought forward from 21:00 to 18:45 local time.

The storm was not expected to be severe enough for the Met Office to name this weather system.

However, large parts of northern and western France were forecast to bear the brunt of the severe weather, prompting Météo France - the equivalent of the Met Office - to name this Storm Benjamin, warning of some damage and travel disruption.

Orange warnings - the next stage up from a yellow - were issued for seven areas along the Atlantic coast and English Channel.

Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.

Benjamin will not replace Bram in the list of UK's named storms.

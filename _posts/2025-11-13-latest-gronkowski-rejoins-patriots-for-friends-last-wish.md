According to new developments, Rob Gronkowski was a second-round pick by the Patriots in the 2010 draft

Rob Gronkowski has fulfilled the dying wish of a friend by signing a one-day contract with the New England Patriots, nearly four years after his last NFL appearance, in order to retire with the team.

The former tight end won three Super Bowls alongside star quarterback Tom Brady during an eight-year stint with the Patriots.

Gronkowski retired in 2019, but came out of retirement to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alongside Brady for two more seasons, winning a fourth championship ring in Florida. 

But 'Gronk' is best known for his time in New England, and there are plans to induct the 36-year-old into the Patriots' hall of fame in 2026. 

Since leaving the team, Gronkowski has continued working with charities in the greater Boston area.

But earlier this month, Gronkowski's charity partner Susan Hurley, a former Patriots cheerleader who founded CharityTeams in 2008, died from cancer. 

Before her death, Hurley publicly requested that Gronkowski return to the Patriots so that he could officially retire at his "home". 

Gronkowski said on Wednesday: "We are 100% here today for her, no doubt about that.

"I've never seen anyone have so much passion and so much grace for what they do and in raising money for other charities."

He added that honouring his long-time friend was an "absolute no-brainer". 

Patriots owner Robert Kraft praised Gronkowski, saying: "His clutch performances were legendary, and his larger than life personality and connections with the fans has truly made him a New England icon."

The American is third in the all-time list for receiving touchdowns (92) by tight ends.

The Patriots host the New York Jets on Thursday (01:15 GMT on Friday).

BBC Women's Footballer of the Year contender Patri Guijarro

Age: 27 Position: Midfielder Teams: Barcelona and Spain

Descriptions of Patri Guijarro tend to include the phrase "unsung hero" and is it clear why.

Being a member of star-studded sides at Barcelona and Spain means the midfielder can sometimes fly under the radar.

But what she lacks in the goals and assist tallies is made up for by her presence as the backbone for her teams, allowing the rest to shine.

Although she suffered a defeat in the Champions League final with her club and lost the Euro 2025 final with her country this year, she won a domestic treble with Barcelona.

The 27-year-old sets the tempo, steadying her team from the base of midfield, overturning possession and creating attacking moves.

While her work may not always be the most glamorous, it is consistent, tenacious and a crucial element of her sides' make-ups.

She has won six league titles, six Copas de le Reina and four Spanish Super Cups, as well as three Champions League crowns. She also made Uefa's Euro 2025 team of the tournament.

Guijarro on being an unsung hero:

"I am very flattered. I've always said that I feel very valued by players, by staff. And for me that's the ultimate. Moreover, that they also transmit it to you. It is a reason to be happy because that means that I help them - that I contribute positive things within the team, which is what I want. It is a great compliment."

On how she got into playing football:

"I started playing in league competition at the age of seven. Since I was very young with my father I played a lot in the backyard. In the park I always went with my father to play, with his brother, with my uncle. Since I was a little girl I have always liked to be with the ball."

On her time with Barcelona:

"I've been here 10 years now. These last few years have been incredible, especially in terms of results, how we are evolving and how we are achieving the objectives we want.

"With the national team as well, now I am where I want to be; the performances I am giving, I am happy to contribute what I am to the club as well as to the national team. I am very happy and very content."

On playing at the Euros:

"That is what I've always wanted - to play for the national team; defend this jersey, your home. That's what any footballer wants to do, to reach to the maximum."

Former Barcelona director Maria Teixidor, who set up Spain's players' union FutPro alongside Guijarro: "Patri is a silent force. There are people that don't need to speak loudly to make themselves present and to make themselves important for the collective game. For Patri, loyalty, values, the good and purpose are important and she has shown that on and off the pitch. "

It is hard to isolate one thing when analysing Guijarro given how great the influence on her sides is.

Her proactivity is a quality that stands out. Guijarro is both able to see the picture of the game before it happens and get her team on the front foot in a brave way, accelerating the tempo of the game appropriately. She does this with her pass selection on the ball and her pressing and movement off the ball.

Her ability to play with both feet often lets her turn and play a direct pass in one smooth motion without requiring additional time to think or extra touches to set herself up to play a pass. This ensures the flow of the game is not interrupted.

Her ability to switch between controlling the game through short passes and launching impressive long balls to team-mates running in behind seamlessly makes her the perfect player to have the game run through.

Guijarro's ability to nullify a high press by playing long, or a deep block by creative short passing and running off the ball, makes her influence on a match hard to compete with.

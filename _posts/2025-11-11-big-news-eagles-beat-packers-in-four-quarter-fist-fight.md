Eagles secure narrow win over Packers

DeVonta Smith's fourth-quarter touchdown helped defending Super Bowl champions the Philadelphia Eagles scrape a 10-7 win against the Green Bay Packers in the NFL.

Quarterback Jalen Hurts found Smith with a 36-yard pass to give the Eagles a 10-0 lead with 10 minutes left at Lambeau Field.

Green Bay's Josh Jacobs went over with a six-yard run with less than six minutes remaining, but Brandon McManus failed with a 64-yard field goal that would have tied the scores in the final seconds.

"We knew it was going to be a four-quarter fist fight," Packers coach Matt LaFleur said.

"Our defence was outstanding and, unfortunately, just too many mistakes offensively to overcome it."

Packers quarterback Jordan Love fumbled a scoring opportunity in the final minute of the first half.

A second successive defeat left the Packers third in the NFC North, behind the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears.

The Eagles, on a three-game winning run, remain top of the NFC East.

Texans hold on for win against Chargers

The Houston Texans beat the Los Angeles Chargers 20-16 on Saturday to clinch an NFL play-off spot for a third straight year.

Despite a late fightback from the Chargers, CJ Stroud's 75-yard touchdown pass to Jayden Higgins and 43-yard scoring pass to Jaylin Noel in the opening six minutes ultimately proved to be the difference as the Texans made it eight straight wins.

The result keeps the Texans' hopes of winning the AFC South alive and also eliminates division rivals Indianapolis Colts, who started the season 7-1, from play-off contention.

Defeat for the Chargers, who were already through to the play-offs, guarantees the AFC West title for the Denver Broncos.

Elsewhere on Saturday, Derrick Henry rushed for a season-high 216 yards and four touchdowns as the Baltimore Ravens kept their hopes of making the play-offs alive by beating the Green Bay Packers.

In Los Angeles, the Texans raced into a 14-0 lead when Stroud connected with Higgins and Noel on their two opening drives.

A field goal from Cameron Dicker got Los Angeles on the board and the kicker had a chance to eat into the lead further before the break but missed from 32 yards - his first miss from within 40 yards in his career.

The Chargers improved after the break and finally got into the endzone late in the third quarter through Oronde Gadsden but two field goals from Ka'imi Fairbairn took the Texans two scores clear. 

Rookie running back Omarion Hampton made it 20-16 with a rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter before Dicker compounded his uncharacteristic day with a missed extra point.

The Texans host the Colts in the final game of the regular season on Sunday, 4 January, while the Chargers travel to Denver to take on the Broncos.

NFL 2025 season: Week 17

Live text commentary on Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio commentary of Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, also focuses on the league's big stories

In the late game, Henry set an NFL record with his seventh career 200-yard game as the Ravens beat the Packers 41-24 at Lambeau Field.

The Ravens (8-8) play at the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) in week 18 and the contest will be for the AFC North title if the Steelers lose to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.

Henry set the tone on Baltimore's opening drive, rushing in from three yards before the Packers responded with a 39-yard Malik Willis touchdown pass to Christian Watson.

The running back was in the endzone again early in the second quarter before field goals from Tyler Loop put the visitors in a strong position. 

Willis scored for the Packers on a 22-yard run but Henry completed his hat-trick to put the Ravens 27-14 in front at half-time.

Green Bay responded after the break and pulled within three after Willis' second touchdown run of the day was followed by a Brandon McManus field goal.

But the Ravens were able to pull out of sight in the fourth quarter as Tyler Huntley threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Zay Flowers and Henry added a 25-yard touchdown run for his fourth score of the night.

The Packers' third straight loss ensures they will be the NFC's seventh seed in the play-offs and that the Chicago Bears will win the NFC North.

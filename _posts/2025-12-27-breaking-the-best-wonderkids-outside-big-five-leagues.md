It has been recently reported that Impressing in one of Europe's biggest leagues is a strong way to make a name for yourself as a promising youngster - but there are plenty of exciting players coming through in the less heralded leagues too.

The CIES Football Observatory, a research group, has analysed the data to compile a list , externalof the highest-ranked players born in 2006 or later who play outside of Europe's established top five leagues (Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A).

Its methodology, external took in data for aerial play, recovery, distribution, take on - which means dribbling the ball at least eight metres towards the opponents' goal - chance creation and finishing.

Here are the top 10 players judged by those metrics - prospects who could well become more recognisable names in 2026.

The Netherlands Under-21 international, aged 19, has been a regular for Dutch side Feyenoord over the past two seasons. Possessing impressive technical and physical ability, he is seen as an exciting modern wing-back in the Jeremie Frimpong and Jurrien Timber mould.

Quenda is only 18 but is already closing in on 50 league appearances for Sporting and his potential has caught the eye of Chelsea, who have agreed to sign him next summer. Comfortable in either the wing-back or winger role, the teenager stands out for his pace and dribbling ability.

Yirenkyi is just 19 but has already been capped nine times by Ghana, such is his promise. The midfielder has made 17 appearances in the Danish top flight so far this season. He is known for his versatility, having played at right-back for his national team.

The 18-year-old Portuguese midfielder has impressed over the past year. He scored and got an assist on his first start for Porto and at last summer's Club World Cup he became the youngest-ever European goalscorer in the history of the tournament when he found the net against Al-Ahly.

Dutch midfielder Smit, 19, has reportedly attracted interest from Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid after he was named player of the tournament at the European Under-19 Championship in Romania in June.

Also known as Pedrinho or Pedro, the 19-year-old forward possesses exciting close-control skills and exceptional confidence that has had many observers suggesting he could be the next Brazilian superstar.

Another exciting Brazilian teenager, the 19-year-old forward, also known as just Rayan, recently helped his country win the South American Under-20 Championship. He was also named the 2025 Campeonato Brasileiro's best newcomer and finished as top scorer in the 2025 Copa do Brasil with five goals.

Capable of playing either at centre-back or left-back, 18-year-old Spanish defender Salinas broke into the Racing Santander first team in December 2024. He has made 13 appearances in Spainâs second tier so far this season.

Gadou may only be 18 but is already an imposing presence at centre-back as he stands at 6ft 5in tall. The France-born teenager came through the youth system at Paris St-Germain before joining RB Salzburg in September 2024. He has played regularly both in the Austrian top flight and Europa League this season.

The 18-year-old midfielder from Argentina is another player that has been causing plenty of excitement in South America. Montoro is able to operate well in tight spaces and possesses excellent passing skills.

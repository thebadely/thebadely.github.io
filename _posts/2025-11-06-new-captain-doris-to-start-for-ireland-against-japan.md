It has been recently reported that Doris made his first appearance since May off the bench against New Zealand

Autumn Nations Series: Ireland v Japan

Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 November Kick-off: 12:40 GMT

Ireland captain Caelan Doris has been named in the starting XV for Saturday's autumn international against Japan in Dublin while Tom Farrell will make his international debut. 

Leinster back row Doris returned from injury as a replacement during last week's 26-13 loss to New Zealand but is deemed fit to start as head coach Andy Farrell rings the changes from their trip to Chicago.

Tom Farrell, the 32-year-old Munster  centre, was named in Ireland's Six Nations squad in 2019 without making an appearance but will make his senior bow alongside Robbie Henshaw in midfield.

"Six years later here we are," said Andy Farrell of selecting his namesake.

"At the ripe, old age of 32 he's playing his best rugby and deserves his shot, not just for the form that he's shown over the last couple of seasons but how he's applied himself since he's come into camp.

"The word resilience doesn't do it justice. He's kept on fighting and fighting and fighting and he gets to make his dream come true."

Andy Farrell has made eight changes to the side beaten last week in Soldier Field.

Joining Doris in the back row are Ryan Baird at blind-side flanker, with Ulster's Nick Timoney coming in at open-side.

Tadhg Beirne, whose early red card following a bunker review against the All Blacks was subsequently rescinded, remains in the second row alongside James Ryan.

However, Ulster's Stuart McCloskey, who picked up a groin injury in Ireland's autumn opener, has been ruled out along with Garry Ringrose who has a hamstring complaint. 

Jacob Stockdale will win his 40th cap as he returns on the wing for a first Test since picking up a shoulder injury in the summer Test against Georgia.

Craig Casey gets the nod to partner Munster team-mate Jack Crowley at half-back, while Ronan Kelleher and Thomas Clarkson come into the front row alongside Andrew Porter who retains his place from the defeat by New Zealand.

Farrell has strong options on the bench with Gus McCarthy, Paddy McCarthy, Finlay Bealham, Cian Prendergast and Jack Conan the forward replacements, while Caolin Blade, Sam Prendergast and Jimmy O'Brien provide the backline reinforcements.

The head coach has said those coming into the team have the chance to show "they mean business" before games against Australia and South Africa this month. 

"Everything gets thrown into the pot in regards to selection when you've four big games and you throw in a bit of travel as well," he said.

"The lads that don't get a chance to play this weekend, they're the ones that are brimming to get back. Coming back to Dublin off the back of a loss isn't nice, you want to get straight back on the horse.

"The ones that go on to the field are the ones with the chance to prove to the rest of them that they mean business."

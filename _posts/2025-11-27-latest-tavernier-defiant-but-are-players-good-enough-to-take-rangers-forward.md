It has been recently reported that Rangers captain James Tavernier insists his side can still reach the knockout stages of the Europa League despite taking just one point from their opening five fixtures.

Ten-man Sporting Braga capitalised on Nasser Djiga's defensive error to earn a 1-1 draw at Ibrox after Rodrigo Zalazar was sent off for headbutting Nicolas Raskin.

Tavernier had put Rangers ahead in first-half injury-time after Gabri Martinez handled, with the prolific full back's finish equaling former striker Ally McCoist's record of 21 European goals for the club.

The draw ends Rangers' seven-game European losing streak, but with trips to Ferencvaros and Porto, either side of the visit of Ludogorets, to come and nine points needed to advance last season, progression would seem a long-shot.

"It feels almost like a loss," Tavernier conceded. "Being a Rangers player, you have to win every single game. That's what we have to do from now to the end of this competition. 

"It's definitely not over, but we have to build from this."

Djiga contrived to head the ball into Martinez's path under no pressure to gift Braga a point, the defender appearing to lose the flight of the ball in swirling conditions.

With John Souttar and Derek Cornelius injured, Djigi was paired with Emmanuel Fernandez, with the former ultimately costing Rangers a vital win.

"I've got no complaint with Nasser, everyone makes a mistake, but we ultimately should have that game tied up before that even happens," Tavernier added.

"We have to be more patient, probing around their final third instead of trying to shoot maybe when it's not on. I've spoken about it before, about being clinical in both boxes, and we've got to do that.

"If we keep it clean sheet, we win. That's our aim as a team, to keep clean sheets. We should have had that in our pocket with the 10 men that we were playing against."

'First time I felt Rangers competitive in Europe' - Rohl

Rangers boss Danny Rohl: "I think it's disappointing but I look at the first 60 minutes. It was the first time I felt my team has been competitive in Europe. I think it's a step forward. But in the end we have to win and close the gaps.

"In the second half, I felt we controlled the game. And then it's one moment, we made one mistake and conceded a goal. This goal looks very cheap. I'm not looking for excuses in this case. I know in the second half the wind gave a lot of problems.

"We have to improve to play 90 minutes at our highest level.

"You can see the table. We didn't lose the opportunity just today. It's about the past four games. I've been here for four weeks and for 60 minutes I see a big difference.

"Today I really see the progress in our team performance. There is no question mark that it goes in the right direction. In European competition you cannot make many mistakes and this is something we have to work on.

"For me it's not about the character of the group when I see how hard they work since I'm here, how much effort they put in. There is of course pressure, there is expectation, you have to deliver."

Former Rangers striker & manager Ally McCoist: "My concern, and it's a big concern, is I'm not sure the team is capable of a lot better than that. I really hope I'm wrong. 

"You can't make mistakes like the goal they conceded. I'm not sure these players can take Rangers to the next level. There's an awful lot of work to be done."

Former Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday: "I think one of the biggest criticisms you've got is that mental side. It just seems as if there's these lapses of concentration.

"It's just a nothing ball into the box. There's no striker or no Braga opponent anywhere near Djiga. He completely misjudges the flight of the ball."

Gary: Rohl has seriously lost the plot if he thinks that is 100% progress. What's he on, because  the supporters need it after that.

Jonny: Djiga and Fernandez aren't good enough. Danilo and Aarons are better but still not good enough. Chermiti isn't good enough. This team needs gutted. I'm sick of watching Tav lose it and start shouting and bawling at them all. 

Gary: That Rangers team is terrible. One of the worst to ever don't the famous blue jersey. Not one of them deserves to be playing for the club. That's how badly we've plummeted.

Denis: Rangers, what a load of rubbish. Team has no backbone, there are a lot of players that are just not good enough. January can't come quick enough. Hopefully the manager will get the support he needs to bring in better players.

David: Another dismal pedestrian performance from Rangers, how fans can pay to watch that team every week is beyond me.

Steven: Let's accept Rangers are not reaching the next round. Even if we'd achieved a result tonight, we can't beat Porto - not with this defence.

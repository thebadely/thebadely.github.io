Experts revealed that Rohl spoke for just under half an hour in his introductory media conference

Just over four and a half months on from Russell Martin's first press conference as Rangers head coach, his successor Danny Rohl faced the media at Ibrox for the first time.

The size of the task he has ahead is well documented, given Martin's chaotic and unsuccessful 123-day tenure.

The former Sheffield Wednesday manager was accompanied by chairman Andrew Cavenagh, and the much maligned duo of sporting director Kevin Thelwell and chief executive Patrick Stewart.

But what exactly did we learn from the 36-year-old German's first public outing as Rangers boss?

One thing emerged loud and clear from Rohl's first appearance in front of the Scottish media - he knows he needs to win matches, and win them quickly.  

His predecessor Martin lasted only 17 matches and 123 days in charge, so I wondered what kind of timeframe the new man thinks is reasonable for him to turn around the tanker Martin once famously referred to.   

While deftly avoiding a direct answer that might bring pressure further down the line, Rohl's message was pretty clear. 

"Hopefully as soon as possible," he said. "This is crucial. 

"In this business you have not so much time. You can speak about the long-term vision but we know it's about the short-term and the short-term is about winning games. This is what I demand.

"One thing is also clear - I need all the players to understand how we want to play. I come back to my big headline: it's winning, it's attractive and it's together. If you do this in that order, I'm convinced that I will stay very long here." 

Martin required a police escort to exit the Falkirk Stadium after his last game in charge. 

We've seen how toxic things can become at football clubs when things are not going well. Protests have almost become an essential part of the matchday experience on both sides of Glasgow these days.

As Rangers' youngest ever head coach, I asked Rohl what qualities he thinks he possesses that would enable him to cope, never mind thrive, in one of the most highly pressurised jobs in British football?

"I think pressure in this business is usual," he said. "You have to learn that very quickly. 

"I think some guys will maybe speak about my age but I'm 16 years down this path.    I had a great opportunity to work with Bayern Munich and be just the assistant coach, but I felt what it means to be a head coach and the pressure you have.  

"You start winning games and then some people will say you have to play nice football. That's the next part but that's exactly what I want to have. I enjoy that and  I'm looking forward to the future."

There were plenty of questions from the media pack for Thelwell.  

Much has been made of the appointment of his son Robbie as head of recruitment, with fans unconvinced he is qualified for the role.

However, he defended and explained the decision to bring Thelwell Jnr to Ibrox.

"It's always uncomfortable to hear and optically I think we all agreed when we made this step to appoint Robbie that he was going to be seen in a particular way," Thelwell said. 

"The reality of the situation is that we want to bring the very best talent here to Rangers. 

"My view on Robbie's career and situation is he didn't need my help in football.

"He's worked at Aston Villa as a senior scout, he then moved to Norwich City as head of scouting and then got promoted to player pathways manager.  

"Before we recruited him, two Premier League clubs wanted to take him. What we did right at the start of the process was talk to Patrick, Andrew and [vice-chairman] Paraag Marathe about this situation.  

"I was extremely transparent and I think Robbie probably went through a more rigorous process than anybody else who's employed by this football club. 

"What I do know is that he will work 25/8 to be successful in this football club and  I'm looking forward to him proving that he's going to be an excellent employee for Rangers."

Thelwell also defended the signing of striker Youssef Chermiti, who arrived at Rangers for a reported initial fee of Â£8m, having failed to score in 24 appearances for Everton.

It was Thelwell who brought the Portuguese youth international to Merseyside from Sporting - again for big money in a Â£15m deal.

He was asked if he stands by his multi-million pound signing, who is yet to score in seven outings for the club.

"Yes, very much so," Thelwell said. "I think Youssef Chermiti  is a player who's got huge potential. 

"I've never doubted him in any way, shape or form. Again, I think Danny will help to get the best out of Youssef.  

"It's very early days for him, he's a young talent and of course with young talents they sometimes take a little bit of time.  

"But I'm certain over the course of his career here he's going to prove that he's a very, very good player." 

Stewart was also in the media firing line, given the vitriol that has been directed his way by some of the club's own supporters.   

There was even a banner in the Sandy Jardine stand during the recent draw with Dundee United inviting him - and Thelwell - to pack his bags before they were packed for him. 

Like his sporting director, Stewart didn't duck the issue. 

"I totally understand the frustration and hurt that the supporters are feeling because results this season haven't been good enough and nobody's happy with those," he said. 

"The hurt and frustration they feel is mirrored within the boardroom.

"Also understand that there has to be an outlet for those frustrations and as chief executive, that's me.   

"I'm a lightning rod for those and my role as a leader is to absorb that, but also now to work harder and make sure that we turn this around. So we've got to earn that trust."

Given his relative youth, and relative inexperience of the British game after less than two years in charge of Sheffield Wednesday,  this all went rather smoothly for Rohl.

If he was nervous, he didn't show it, smiling broadly from start to finish and engaging quickly and eagerly with the assembled media.

The famed German punctuality and efficiency was there right from the off, as he walked up to the top table in the press conference room at exactly 15:30, as advertised. 

He was expansive in his answers, speaking excellent English. His desire to win first then play nice football afterwards will go down well with supporters.   

He was also clear that he's here to get down to business right away, no messing about. He was officially appointed late on Monday but has already taken his first training session and said he was delighted with the players' "intensity".

He'd better get used to intensity. He's now front and centre in the glare of an unforgiving Glasgow spotlight. His side has given Celtic an eight point start, while Premiership leaders Hearts are 13 points clear of Rangers. There isn't a second to waste.  

He told us he likes a challenge. Just as well.  

He's now embarked on arguably the biggest one of his life so far. One which could make or break his fledgling coaching career.

Let's dive into the details: George Clarke and several of his fellow Strictly Come Dancing stars were scrolling through their social feeds last month when something stopped them in their tracks. 

Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman had just announced in an Instagram video that they were stepping down as presenters of the hit BBC One show after 21 and 11 years respectively.

Not that the contestants of the current series knew - this was news to them.

"I think we found out as everybody else did, just on their socials, which I'm constantly refreshing anyway, as I'm a big fan," said Clarke, a YouTuber and podcaster.

"I don't think anybody expected it."

"We'd just finished on Lorraine, and we just looked at our phones and we saw it on social media," added Emmerdale actor Lewis Cope.

"We were so shocked. And then we were told later, it had to be that way, and they couldn't really give anyone a heads up."

"No one saw it coming," drag queen and Strictly star La Voix said.

Daly and Winkleman's revelation sparked a huge reaction online, with the pair saying in a joint statement at the time that they "were always going to leave together and now feels like the right time".

It's the right time for them, but a rocky time for the show - following several controversies in recent years.

And on Thursday night, it emerged that an unnamed Strictly star was arrested last month on suspicion of rape. Hertfordshire Police said the man was released on bail under investigation.

The development is not understood to be related to the current series of Strictly.

Nearly one month on from Daly and Winkleman's announcement, BBC News spoke to the Strictly contestants ahead of the show heading to the Blackpool Tower Ballroom this weekend.

Much attention has turned to who may replace the presenting pair, with Alan Carr and Holly Willoughby among the names being speculated upon.

EastEnders star Balvinder Sopal said "you feel like it's the end of an era, and you don't know what the show is going to look like in the future".

Speaking to the Rest is Entertainment podcast this week, Kate Phillips, the BBC's chief content officer, admitted her inbox had been "inundated" with people expressing interest in the job.

"We have had so many people who are keen to be considered, which is great."

Despite the shock of that exit, Strictly is hurtling towards its final weeks - and the contest is getting tougher. 

For many celebrities and professionals, it's a major goal to reach the annual episode filmed in Blackpool Tower Ballroom, which usually marks the halfway point in the competition and is a change of scenery from the usual location of Elstree Studios.

La Voix won't be joining the stars in the 19th century ballroom after being forced to withdraw because of injury, so will get a pass through to next week under Strictly rules, but the six other remaining couples will compete alongside live performances from Lewis Capaldi and Steps.

Former Strictly finalists Ashley Roberts, Danny Mac, Jay McGuiness and Layton Williams will also return for the special.

For Cope, it feels like an "achievement" to have reached Blackpool week.

"Although you have the themed weeks leading up to it, it feels like the first big milestone," he said. "And the fish and chips are really nice."

Former England footballer Karen Carney feels similar. 

"I spoke to my sister this morning, and she was like, they're really proud we've reached this milestone. They didn't think I'd be able to do it," she said.

All the stars have been putting in long hours as they get ready for the experience.

But former Love Island winner Amber Davies is trying to approach Blackpool as she would any other week. 

"I don't want to look back with regrets. I'm literally pushing my mind and my body to the furthest it can go," she said.

Amid the glitz of the dancefloor, Strictly, which has been airing since 2004, has faced multiple controversies in recent years relating to the behaviour of some of its professionals and celebrity guests, with some alleging a toxic culture on the show.

We asked the current stars whether they've felt this to be the case.

Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston, for her part, says she "doesn't read stuff like that" in the press.

"The thing that I have found really so extraordinary and unexpected is that everybody is so lovely," she said.

"No one can make Strictly not exhausting and not painful. Your feet kill and your back hurts and you're trying desperately to hold your physical self together week by week, but the emotional support is incredible," La Voix added.

Since we did those interviews, the Sun reported this week that a male Strictly star is alleged to have raped a woman after a BBC event. 

According to the paper, the woman was not a contestant or pro on the show.

Another BBC TV behemoth - The Traitors - has risen to new heights this year with Celebrity Traitors, with up to 13 million viewers tuning in - more than double the number who watched this year's Strictly launch show.

So, we asked the contestants, has Traitors stolen Strictly's sparkle this year?

Cope, for his part, isn't too worried. "I think it's brilliant, isn't it? Just more great shows on television," he said. "I think it's only a positive."

"There's enough success in the world for everything," Davies agreed.

"And also," she added, "we've got one diamond amongst both of them - Claudia."

Strictly Come Dancing's Blackpool special is on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 6.35pm on Saturday.

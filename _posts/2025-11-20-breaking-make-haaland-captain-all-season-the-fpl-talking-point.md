Let's dive into the details: Erling Haaland has scored 14 goals in 11 Premier League matches this season

There seems to be no stopping Manchester City striker Erling Haaland.

He won the Premier League Golden Boot in 2022-23 and 2023-24 and is on course to do so again this season as he has 14 goals, six more than any other player.

He scored four in the recent international break in Norway's wins over Estonia and Italy to secure their spot at the 2026 World Cup.

Haaland is the top points scorer in Fantasy Premier League with 102 - 21 clear of Arsenal defender Gabriel, the next highest, and 42 ahead of the second-best forward, Brentford's Igor Thiago.

Haaland has an incredible 99 goals in 108 Premier League appearances - and has a chance to get to his century at Newcastle on Saturday.

So we are asking: Is Haaland now a set-and-forget captain choice or do we need to look at alternative options each week?

This week's FPL expert and the guys from The FPL Podcast by BBC Sport debate the latest talking point.

"My strategy this season is just to back Erling Haaland - just to keep with him," said Premier League title-winning striker Chris Sutton.

Statman Dave said: "I don't think you should move away from Haaland right now. He scored eight goals in his last five games. He's flying - (his) numbers are the best in the league by a mile. It's not the time right to do it.

"There potentially could be a time when you look at Haaland versus a team that's going to sit deep and play five at the back.

"Newcastle have caused City some problems at home in recent years. But Haaland at the moment and Manchester City are looking a lot better. They were fantastic against Liverpool."

Unsurprisingly, Haaland is the most selected player in FPL, appearing in 71% of teams.

But who do you go for if you have not got Haaland or want to try something different?

"[Manchester United midfielder] Bryan Mbeumo," said Statman Dave. "He's the only man to captain this week if you're not going for Haaland.

"They have Everton at home and United have looked very, very good at home compared to their away performances, which have been a little bit inconsistent. They have created a lot of chances."

For many, the prolific Haaland has been a locked-in captain choice in the past few weeks, but I was willing to bet against him and consider alternatives in gameweek 12 with a trip to Newcastle.

That was until I saw how good City - and Haaland - were against Liverpool. Haaland continued his electric scoring form in the international break and it feels far too risky to back against him this time round.

It is worth noting that Haaland has played Newcastle on six occasions in league and cup and scored only one goal.

A trip to St James' Park is widely regarded as one of the toughest fixtures in the calendar, so in a week when Arsenal (Spurs at home), Manchester United (Everton at home) and Crystal Palace (Wolves away) have attractive fixtures, Bukayo Saka, Mbeumo or Jean-Philippe Mateta could be considered for those with an appetite for risk.

As we look ahead at the festive schedule, there are weeks when I might be brave enough to back against Haaland - trips to Fulham in gameweek 14 and Crystal Palace in gameweek 16.

Midfielders Saka and Mbeumo looked great last time out and, if their form continues, they offer an alternative to Haaland. In the two gameweeks mentioned, Mbeumo plays West Ham at home and Saka takes on Wolves at home.

Historically, we have relied on Mohamed Salah as our go-to captain when backing against Haaland, and Liverpool's fixtures provide some hope for those backing the out-of-form Egyptian.

Most engaged managers have sold Salah but, with lots of Free Hit chips in play in the next few weeks, Salah is again a legitimate option with the armband for many.

The below chart shows two alternatives to Haaland for the next six weeks. In bold is who I will likely pick as captain.

GW12: Haaland v Newcastle (a), Salah v Forest (h), Mbeumo v Everton (h).

GW13: Haaland v Leeds (h), Salah v West Ham (a), Igor Thiago v Burnley (h).

GW14: Haaland v Fulham (a), Saka v Brentford (h), Mbeumo v West Ham (h).

GW15: Haaland v Sunderland (h), Salah v Leeds (a), Mbeumo v Wolves (a).

GW16: Haaland v Crystal Palace (a), Salah v Brighton (h), Saka v Wolves (h).

GW17: Haaland v West Ham (h), Semenyo v Burnley (h), Saka v Everton (a).

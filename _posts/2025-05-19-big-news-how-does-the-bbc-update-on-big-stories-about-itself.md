Here’s what you need to know: Gary Lineker is the BBC's highest-paid presenter

Whenever big news stories involving the BBC come along, journalists at BBC News and BBC Sport are required to report on the corporation just as they would with any other information that is in the public interest.

BBC News and BBC Sport are internal divisions of the BBC, meaning journalists working here are not always privy to big decisions taken by those at the top of the corporation.

That means staff handle news involving their employer with the same approach and standards they would any other story - by attempting to verify information, contacting the press office, and requesting comment and interviews from those involved in the story.

They then aim to communicate the news to the public in the most impartial, timely and transparent way possible.

Journalists working for BBC News and BBC Sport sometimes even 'doorstep' their bosses - approaching senior figures for unplanned interviews at home, in corridors or on the street to discuss important, newsworthy matters.

Sometimes stories involving the BBC might be reported elsewhere first, for various reasons. Other media outlets may have been given information by a source that has not yet reached BBC journalists, or might have a different approach to the way they publish news stories.

BBC Sport has a policy of 'double-sourcing' the news it reports - verifying information with at least two separate entities before publishing to ensure that our news reporting is accurate.

The news Gary Lineker will leave the BBC is one example of BBC journalists having to report on a big story involving their employer.

So, how has the BBC informed its audience about the story?

In November 2024, it was announced that Lineker would leave Match of the Day at the end of the season, but would continue to host BBC Sport's coverage of the 2026 World Cup and next season's FA Cup.

That news was first reported by other media outlets, with BBC News journalists confirming its accuracy about 50 minutes later,

On Sunday, reports suggested Lineker was set to leave the BBC earlier than planned - and no longer host the World Cup or FA Cup.

The BBC said an announcement was expected on Monday, with its culture and media editor Katie Razzall reporting BBC bosses considered Lineker's position untenable after he had to apologise for sharing a social media post about Zionism.

The BBC's social media rules say presenters of flagship programmes have "a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality".

The official announcement was made at midday on Monday.

BBC director-general Tim Davie said: "Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.

"Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades. His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made."

In a statement, Lineker recognised the "error and upset caused", and reiterated his apologies.

"I care deeply about the game, and about the work I've done with the BBC over many years. As I've said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic â it goes against everything I stand for."

Shortly after the news broke, BBC staff received an email from director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski.

"I appreciate the last week has been difficult and emotional for many of you," he said.

"Thank you for all the messages and conversations, even if some of them weren't easy to have. And I hope you understand that I had to wait until now to tell you the news.

"It is sad to be saying goodbye to such a brilliant broadcaster and I also want to thank Gary for his years of service."

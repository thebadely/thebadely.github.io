Experts revealed that Kevin has scored two goals in seven appearances for Brazil Under-20s

Fulham are closing in on a club record Â£34.6m move for Shakhtar Donetsk winger Kevin.

The move for the 22-year-old Brazilian is expected to surpass the club's current transfer record - the initial Â£27m they paid to sign attacker Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal last summer.

Kevin predominantly plays on the left wing and has scored 17 goals and provided 10 assists in 57 matches for the Ukrainian side.  

His signing would be a boost for Fulham boss Marco Silva, who previously complained about the club's slow pace in the transfer market.

Silva said the Cottagers had been "passive" in the summer window, having only added French goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte from Montpellier.

Fulham are still believed to be in the market for an additional attacker and have expressed an interest in Chelsea's Raheem Sterling and Basel's Philip Otele.

The Cottagers have two points from their opening three Premier League games and were 16th in the table after Saturday's fixtures. 

They followed up opening draws at Brighton and at home to Manchester United with a controversial 2-0 defeat at west London rivals Chelsea.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The England Women's Rugby World Cup shirt is not allowed to display the O2 sponsor logo

Fans have been left unable to buy England's Women's Rugby World Cup shirts after manufacturer Castore admitted a supply chain error.

The Red Roses start their World Cup campaign against the USA at Sunderland's Stadium of Light at 19:30 BST on Friday.

The tournament shirt worn by England features red trim and does not have the logo of shirt sponsors O2 printed - World Cup rules state teams are not allowed to showcase brand deals on their kits.

The RFU is understood to be frustrated at the supply issue.

British brand Castore said: "We can confirm that official England Rugby World Cup shirts are now in short supply, as fans continue to show their amazing support for the Red Roses. Online stores are now sold out, but stock will be available at England game match venues."

Record crowds are expected to attend the 2025 World Cup, with 375,000 of the 470,000 tickets having already been sold, including the 82,000 tickets for the final at Twickenham.

The Red Roses unveiled their Castore kit in May after the previous agreement with Umbro was ended three years early.

This is not the first time Castore has come under scrutiny over its sportswear. Two years ago Aston Villa footballers complained about the weight of their Castore shirts and their ability to absorb sweat, and the club subsequently switched to Adidas as their kit maker.

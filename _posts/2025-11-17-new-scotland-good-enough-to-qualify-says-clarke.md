Head coach Steve Clarke insists Scotland are in a "good place" for the "cup final we all wanted" against Denmark on Tuesday, with a World Cup place on the line at Hampden.

Scotland must beat the Danes to seal qualification for the first time since 1998.

Clarke's side are guaranteed a top-two finish and will be involved in the March play-offs if they finish runners-up, with 12 nations competing for four spots.

"The players understand the magnitude of the game but they just have to prepare for a game of football and make sure they are focused on how we want to play and on what Denmark might do," said Clarke, who must do without the injured Billy Gilmour.

"If they go out and play as they can, then I believe they are good enough to get the result we need."

Scotland lost 3-2 away to Greece on Saturday but are one point behind Denmark, who were held to a surprise 2-2 draw at home to Belarus at the same time.

Clarke conceded his squad have not been at their best in this campaign but stressed: "This was always the scenario we had in our heads, a final home game against Denmark to qualify.

"We have the points required to make sure this is the cup final we all wanted.

"In football sometimes things don't go your way. The most important thing in a qualifying campaign is points.

"We were drawn as a pot three team, but we are already in second place. We want to go one step further and finish top of the group."

Describing Denmark as "habitual qualifiers", Clarke was asked about his approach for a must-win match, and explained: "You have to get the balance right in every game, between attacking when you can and defending well when you need to.

"You can probably reference that in the last game against Greece when we got quite a lot going right going forward and quite a lot wrong going the other way."

Clarke has been in charge since May 2019 and has taken Scotland to two successive European Championship finals.

"The players have shown they know how to qualify for tournaments, so let's qualify for another one," said the 62-year-old.

"Way back at the start I said we didn't have enough experience, we didn't have enough caps in the squad. Now we've got enough caps and experience and hopefully that, allied to the talent in the group, that experience can be vital."

On the eve of such a huge game Clarke said he was "feeling okay, pretty calm", and added: "I always trust my players.

"The lads seem to be in pretty good spirits. Everyone is in a good place."

Napoli midfielder Gilmour had hoped to recover from a groin problem after sitting out the loss in Greece, but has not made it.

"Everyone else is fit and ready to go," confirmed Clarke.

Scotland opened this campaign with a goalless draw in Copenhagen, while they have won their past three home games against Denmark.

There has not always been a positive atmosphere at Hampden in the previous two home games. There were boos at half-time in October's 3-1 win over Greece, while some jeered after a 2-1 victory over Belarus.

"We need the crowd with us," added Clarke. "We probably need them more in the difficult moments. If we all work together, we can make it a great night for the country."

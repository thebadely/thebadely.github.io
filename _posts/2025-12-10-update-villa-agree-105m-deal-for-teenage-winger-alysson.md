Aston Villa have agreed a Â£10.5m deal to sign 19-year-old Brazilian winger Alysson from Gremio.

He is set to undergo a medical before joining in January, with the deal initially worth Â£8.7m plus a further Â£1.8m in performance-related add-ons.

Gremio, who finished ninth in Brazil's Serie A this season, have also agreed a 10% sell-on clause for the player.

The Midlands club beat league leaders Arsenal on Saturday to move three points behind them in the Premier League table and up to third, behind second-placed Manchester City.

According to new developments, President Trump's State Visit to the UK features prominently with many papers publishing photos of him and his wife, First Lady Melania, dressed for Wednesday's banquet at Windsor Castle. 

The Times focuses on the King's praise for the special relationship between the US and Britain, calling the two countries 'the closest of kin'. 

The Daily Express quotes Trump as thanking the King with the headline "my respect for you and Britain".

The Guardian highlights the government's announcement that Â£150bn of US money is to be invested in the UK. The paper suggests Sir Keir Starmer is banking on the investments to placate critics of President Trump's visit.

The Daily Mail says the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has "blasted" migrants who lodge last minute legal challenges against deportation, accusing them of "making a mockery of our laws". 

The Daily Telegraph claims a Home Office-backed charity is offering advice to migrants on how to beat the system. The charity tells the paper this isn't true and it is there to provide legal advice.

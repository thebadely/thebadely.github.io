Experts revealed that Nicolas Kuhn is still at Celtic, but Greg Taylor, Benjamin Nygren and Kieran Tierney have moved this summer

Celtic continued their domination of Scottish football last season, but even the league champions have faced challenges this summer.

Not only did an otherwise successful two-trophy season end in disappointment as they lost to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final, but there are the inevitable comings and goings in the transfer market.

It is early days yet, of course, but is Brendan Rodgers' squad stronger or weaker at this stage of the summer transfer window and a month before the start to their competitive season?

Kuhn to Como 'great business' for Celtic - Rodgers

Final farewell at Celtic Park for Lisbon Lion John Clark

In goal, Celtic have had an almost like-for-like change, with long-time back-up Scott Bain heading to promoted Falkirk in search of first-team starts and the younger Ross Doohan, who had been in a similar position with Aberdeen, returning to the Glasgow club to effectively be a number three behind Kasper Schmeichel and Viljami Sinisalo.

In central defence, Maik Nawrocki has joined German second-tier side Hannover 96 on loan with an option to buy while Hayato Inamura has been bought from J-League relegation candidates Albirex Niigata.

However, although the Polish 24-year-old made all of five appearances last season, it appears that the Japanese player, one year younger, will not be a straight replacement considering Rodgers is thinking of sending him straight out on loan.

It is at left-back, though, where the Celtic face a more taxing transfer dilemma.

The return of Kieran Tierney at the end of his Arsenal contract was generally welcomed as a marquee signing that will strengthen the starting XI.

However, with fellow Scotland defender Greg Taylor rejecting a new deal and joining PAOK in Greece and experienced back-up Jeffrey Schlupp returning to Crystal Palace at the end of his loan, it leaves Celtic with "a tough sell" for any potential replacement, according to former Falkirk striker Rory Loy.

"If you are going to go out and get a really established left-back who's coming in, the first thing you do, you look at their squad and you see Kieran Tierney there," he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.

"It is a hard thing to say to a left-back that you're coming in as second choice."

Loy believes an older player, like Schlupp, or young player happy to "come in for a few games" may be the markets Celtic search for a Taylor replacement.

Former Scotland midfielder Leanne Crichton, though, believes that Tierney's history of injuries - "he rarely finishes games" he does play - mean any back-up "will play a considerable amount of time".

With winger Jota absent through injury until near the end of the year, Celtic needed an immediate replacement on the wing and got it early on with the purchase from Danish club Nordsjaelland of Benjamin Nygren.

The 23-year-old recent Sweden cap has the potential to be just as exciting as the sidelined Portuguese but Celtic will have to search for yet another wide man should Nicolas Kuhn complete his expected transfer to ambitious Serie A upstarts Como.

Rodgers suggested it would be "great business all round" should the 25-year-old be sold for what will reportedly be five times the Â£3m Celtic paid Rapid Vienna for the German in January last year.

They will, though, need to find someone of a calibre to match Kuhn's 21 goals in 41 starts and 10 substitute appearances last season.

"He's almost blown hot and cold at points and, towards the end of the season, looked like a player that was ready to go," Crichton suggested. "I just feel his performance levels dipped.

"For whatever reason, it maybe just doesn't feel like that's the long-term project for him and Celtic. I don't think Brendan Rodgers is the type of manager that would wait about and try to encourage you to stay at Celtic and apply yourself.

"So, for both parties, it looks like a pretty fair deal. He is not irreplaceable."

Former Rangers assistant Billy Dodds suggested "it is the right time to sell - it is a no-brainer, it's time to go" and fellow former Ibrox striker Loy concurred. 

"Managers want players they can trust," he said. "There was a wee five-month spell there where you could trust Nicolas Kuhn, but in the last three months of the season, he was getting substituted a lot around the 60-minute mark."

Celtic have yet to properly replace Kyogo Furuhashi 

While West Ham United raided Celtic Park for prospect Daniel Cummings, the Scottish champions returned the favour by taking fellow 19-year-old striker Callum Osmand from Fulham.

Johnny Kenny, meanwhile, will be hoping to persuade Rodgers that he is ready for more first-team action after the 22-year-old made some fleeting appearances at the end of last season after impressing for Shamrock Rovers in the Conference League.

However, with the Celtic manager admitting he is considering another loan for the Irishman, he will be looking elsewhere for the delayed replacement for Kyogo Furuhashi, who left in January for Rennes but this weekend joined Birmingham City.

Crichton believes losing the Scottish Cup final was proof that Celtic lacked some "firepower" despite one of Kyogo's Japan team-mates having proved he can be effective up front.

"Daizen Maeda does a real good job through the middle - Adam Idah is there as well," she said. "But Celtic are a team that scores goals from all over the pitch."

Dodds suggested: "Surely they are going to have to add a striker. They are desperate to get Maeda back out wide.

"They can use him as an emergency striker, scores a lot of goals, but surely they are wanting somebody of a type to give competition to Idah."

Loy believes, looking at Celtic's early moves in the transfer market, "quite possibly they are slightly weaker" but points out they normally wait until close to the end of the transfer window.

"I think they paid over the odds getting Idah in the door recently, so it's not always worked in their favour, waiting that long," he said.

"But I don't think there will be any panic or rush from Celtic. If you look at Kyogo and Kuhn, that's another Â£25m to add to all the other transfers."

Roy thinks bigger signings might hinge on Celtic winning their Champions League play-off.

"Celtic fans need to be a bit more patient than other clubs, but they are in a very good position," he said.

Dodds pointed out that "Celtic don't panic" despite supporters urging them to dip into the money they have in the bank. 

"They take their time and usually get it right," he said.

Dodds, who finished the season as Rangers' assistant head coach, suggested that only 30% of the squad he and Barry Ferguson had were right for the club.

"Celtic have 80% of their squad right and 20% wrong," he thought. "They have got it right, so they don't have to rush, but the Celtic fans, having lost to Aberdeen, won't accept another hiccup."

Are they good enough just now to compete with the squad they've got? "Absolutely, but they have to add a bit more firepower," Crichton concluded.

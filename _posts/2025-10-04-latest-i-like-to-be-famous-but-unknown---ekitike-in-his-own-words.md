Hugo Ekitike has certainly made an impact since joining Liverpool - scoring five goals in his first 10 appearances.

The Frenchman has settled straight into life in the Premier League after a Â£69m summer move from Eintracht Frankfurt.

The 23-year-old started his career with Reims, then had a short spell in Denmark with Vejle Boldklub before securing a move to Paris St-Germain - first on loan, then on a longer-term deal.

Things didn't work for him in the French capital, but a transfer to Frankfurt kick-started Ekitike's career.

There he scored 15 goals and provided eight assists in the Bundesliga last season.

Ekitike sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about his childhood, what it's like to play alongside Mohamed Salah and how he loves to draw.

Kelly Somers: What was a young Hugo Ekitike like?

Hugo Ekitike: Shy. Very shy. I have changed this. Nice, same as now. And passionate with football.

Kelly: At what point did football enter your life or has it always been there?

Hugo: I think football is just my whole life. I just did football. Even when I talk with my brothers, most of the time it's football. That is just my passion and I just love what I do. At the moment, it is the only thing on my mind, and since I was young.

Kelly: You just mentioned your brothers - are they your earliest memory of  football, playing with them?

Hugo: They are not good at football! We all love football but we just randomly played in the street and I have always been playing outside. I remember also [playing] at school. I kind of played it everywhere when I was young - that is my memories of football.

Kelly: When did you realise you were better than your brothers at football?

Hugo: Not only my brothers but my cousin was playing football. They were playing for fun in teams and stuff but they didn't reach the top level. But my family love football and we share the same passion. It didn't work for them but they live the dream through me.

Kelly: Have you always been a forward?

Hugo: I have always been an offensive player. When I was younger, I was smaller so I was a winger, but around 16-21 I grew and now I am too long! That is why I went in the middle - a centre-forward.

Kelly: Too long? I don't think you can be too long as a striker...

Hugo: Not too long, but obviously I am tall. I think Cody [Gakpo] is the only tall winger I know.

Kelly: Can you remember the name of the first team you played for and what do you remember from playing there?

Hugo: Cormontreuil. I remember that was the club from my area so it wasn't that serious. We just went on the pitch, no warm-up, we just played games. I was very young. I started when I was four and a half so at that time I was just learning the basics. I went to football to have fun. It was not serious. It was good times.

Kelly: Can you name anyone, like a coach, who has guided you or had the biggest impact on your career?

Hugo: I remember the name of my first coach - Rodolf. He was the one who brought me to Cormontreuil when I was young. Where I was from, I was in the centre for kids because my mum was working. He brought me to the team. When I was in Paris, I came back because I have my name somewhere in the football club. We don't talk much but I remember him and if I go home one day, I will go to say 'hi'.

Winning title with Liverpool would be 'class' - Ekitike

Kelly: Has there been one particular turning point in your career?

Hugo: When I was 14, I was playing in the Reims academy and I was bad. I was really bad. I was the kind who dreamed a lot on the pitch. I had quality but I was dreaming too much - a sleeping player.

I had an appointment with my parent. They told me if that were at the end of the season, that would be the end. 

Kelly: You would be released?

Hugo: Yeah. I knew then it would never happen. In my mind, I wanted to be the best. When I came back, I was really good. It focused me and there was a turning point. I had other turning points later but that was the first one in my life.

Kelly: What other turning points have you had? You've already played in four countries and you're only 23.

Hugo: When I went to Denmark, I was on the bench - I didn't play. That was the turning point because I wanted to show I was good. When I came back to Reims, I was the first striker on the list. They wanted me to go on loan but I showed in pre-season that I could play. That was a turning point. It made my whole life.

Kelly: Your time at PSG - how much has that shaped who you are today?

Hugo: Becoming a good player is the biggest turning point in my life. That was the first moment in my life that I have known failure. It was probably half-time and it set me to be more tough in the head. I am different since I went to Paris. I am a way better player and better human. I have changed so much.

Kelly: What has it been like at Liverpool so far?

Hugo: The first feeling was that I was proud. To come here when I know where I come from. I know football is just moments - you can be at the top and go down straight. I set my mind to always be ready, work hard, improve myself and bring success to the team and help the maximum way I can to reach trophies and wins.

Kelly: What is it like playing with Mohamed Salah?

Hugo: Really good. Mo is a really cool guy, he is really open with me and is really good to talk too. He is great to play with. I was watching him on TV when he was scoring the goals and stuff but he is a really great athlete. You can just improve yourself and learn from him. It is good to share the pitch with him and I hope we are going to score lots of goals and bring some wins to the team together.

Kelly: What is he like as a person, away from the pitch?

Hugo: He is very cool. More cool than what I have seen on TV because sometimes you see straight face and stuff so I thought he was cold... someone who doesn't talk a lot. He is really open, like all of the guys here. They are really open and want me to adapt to the team.

Kelly: What are your memories from your childhood?

Hugo: I grew up more with my mum. I spent a lot of time with my mum and my little brother. It was just football. I was going to school and playing football. Everywhere.

Kelly: I saw a video of your brothers and friends when you scored your first Liverpool goal.

Hugo: I remember my friend was there, but it was too much - I don't like that kind of video. But it was nice because when I was in Paris, they were there with me. I have the same people there when I have success and when I don't have success, and I think they are very proud of me and I think in time they are going to be good memories to see on video. Hopefully they will be there for many more goals.

Kelly: You said there you don't like that sort of video. Are you quite a private person?

Hugo: If it's me, I show this to people. I know it comes with being a football player with Liverpool - you are more famous, but my private life I don't want people to know. I like to be famous but unknown. People don't know what I am doing when I am home or what I do during my free time or talking to my brother.

Kelly: What do you do on your typical day off away from football?

Hugo: One day off or two days off?

Kelly: Your choice. Do you get two days off at Liverpool often?

Hugo: Not often, but if it happens I go to Paris to my family house and meet everybody. If I have one day off, honestly there's not much I can do. I just chill at home - recovery, PlayStation, swimming pool, jacuzzi. I watch movies. 

Kelly: What kind of movies do you like?

Hugo: My favourite one? I have two which are Whiplash and The Wolf of Wall Street.

Kelly: Tell me one thing about yourself that might surprise me:

Hugo: I am left-handed, you didn't know? I don't know, something special? 

Kelly: Have you got a secret talent?

Hugo: Ah yes, I have one. I can draw. People, everything, life. Sometimes I like to draw. It's always been easy for me.

Kelly: If you could only achieve one more thing in your career what would it be?

Hugo: It's difficult because I want to achieve so many things but, right now, Premier League with Liverpool. 

Kelly: That's why you came here isn't it?

Hugo: Yeah. I know how special it is to win the Premier League for English people. Especially here. So, yeah, to win the league with Liverpool it would be class. I'm excited.

Here’s what you need to know: Bryan Mbeumo joined Brentford from French club Troyes in 2019

Manchester United have had an improved bid worth up to Â£62.5m for Bryan Mbeumo rejected by Brentford.

United have bid Â£55m plus Â£7.5m in add-ons for the 25-year-old.

They had a bid of Â£45m plus up to Â£10m in add-ons for the Cameroon forward turned down earlier this month.

United are looking to add goals to their side having already signed forward Matheus Cunha from Wolves for Â£62.5m.

Sources have suggested Brentford would want at least the same fee as Wolves have received for Cunha up front before they agree to the sale of a player who still has a year left on his contract.

Mbeumo scored a career-best 20 goals for Brentford last season and contributed nine assists.

United may face competition from elsewhere, with new Tottenham manager Thomas Frank keen to be reunited with Mbeumo, while there has also been interest from other Champions League clubs.

An international colleague of United goalkeeper Andre Onana, Mbeumo is likely to miss four weeks of the 2025-26 campaign because of Cameroon's participation in the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.

Cameroon play Gabon in their opening group game on 24 December.

Mbeumo joined Brentford from French club Troyes in 2019, when the Bees were still in the Championship.

He has scored 70 goals in 242 appearances in all competitions, helping the west London club earn promotion to the top flight in 2021.

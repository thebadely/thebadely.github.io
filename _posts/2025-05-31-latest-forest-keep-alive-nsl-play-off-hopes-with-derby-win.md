It has been recently reported that Rolene Streutker joined Nottingham Forest in 2025 to play in the Netball Super League for the first time

Nottingham Forest kept alive their Netball Super League play-off hopes with a 66-62 win against defending champions Loughborough Lightning.

Forest, who are competing in their first Netball Super League (NSL) season, are now three points behind fourth-placed London Mavericks, who play Birmingham Panthers on Sunday.

There is only one play-off place left up for grabs with two regular season rounds to go as Manchester Thunder, London Pulse and Loughborough have already qualified.

Thunder secured their play-off spot on Friday with a 59-54 win over Cardiff Dragons.

Forest led after every quarter in an impressive display at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, home to both teams. Particularly strong performances came from player of the match Natasha Pavelin and Rolene Streutker, who scored 41 goals.

The victory halted Loughborough's winning steak - they had not lost since round four, also against Forest.

Defeat prevented Loughborough from moving to top of the NSL table.

"Really happy, we knew coming into the game we could do a job," Pavelin told Sky Sports. "We all really believed. We put out four quarters there which we can be really proud of."

Elsewhere, Thunder's Elmere van der Berg top-scored with 37 goals at Belle Vue Arena in her team's win over Cardiff.

Victory for Thunder moved them up to second in the standings on 28 points, but they trail leaders Pulse on goal difference.

Goal shooter Georgia Rowe scored 26 for Dragons, who remain bottom after losing all but one of their 12 matches so far. 

Round 12 will conclude on Sunday as London Pulse face Leeds Rhinos and Birmingham Panthers take on London Mavericks.

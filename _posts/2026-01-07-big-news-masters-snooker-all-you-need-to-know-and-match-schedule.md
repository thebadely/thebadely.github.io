Murphy beats Wilson in thrilling Masters final - best shots

Shaun Murphy will get the defence of his Masters title under way on Sunday, 11 January at London's Alexandra Palace.

The Englishman, who beat Kyren Wilson 10-7 in last year's final, is bidding to win the tournament for a third time, having also won the tournament in 2015.

The Masters, a non-ranking event for the world's top 16 players, is the second Triple Crown competition of the season. 

The UK Championship, which was won by Mark Selby in December, and the World Championship, which starts in April, are the other two Triple Crown tournaments.

This year's Masters features five Chinese players for the first time in the tournament's 51-year history.

Keep reading to find out the match schedule, BBC TV coverage details, prize money, former champions and maximum breaks at the Masters.

As defending champion, world number seven Murphy is the top seed for the 52nd Masters tournament. He gets play under way at 13:00 GMT on Sunday against China's highly rated Wu Yize.

China's Zhao Xintong, who starts against 16th seed Gary Wilson on Monday, is promoted to second seed from a ranking of ninth because of his status as world champion.

World number one Judd Trump, champion in 2019 and 2023, is the third seed. The Englishman will be keen to get 2026 off to a flying start after failing to win a title last year. He faces 2011 champion Ding Junhui on Wednesday, 14 January.

Kyren Wilson, last year's runner-up, is seeded fourth. The 2024 world champion struggled at the UK Championship, saying he was close to having a "mental breakdown" during his 6-4 defeat by Elliot Slessor.

Mark Williams and John Higgins, two parts of snooker's famous Class of 92 alongside Ronnie O'Sullivan, are seeded sixth and seventh respectively. They are both two-time Masters champions.

Selby looked back to his formidable best at the UK Championship and is arguably the favourite to win his fourth Masters title, despite only being seeded eighth. He takes on Xiao Guodong on Sunday.

Eight-time Masters champion O'Sullivan lost in the first round of the UK Championship as he also missed out on a ranking title in 2025. 

O'Sullivan, who turned 50 in December, is seeded ninth and faces fifth seed Neil Robertson in his opening match on Wednesday, 14 January.

Robertson, a two-time Masters winner, leads the one-year ranking list thanks to notable wins at the lucrative Saudi Masters and the World Grand Prix.

Let's dive into the details: Officials familiar with the US plan to end the war in Ukraine tell the Daily Telegraph  that it would see Kyiv receive a "rental fee" in exchange for Russia taking control of the Donbas region. The report says Russian would also be made an official language, and Ukraine's military would be halved. But one insider tells the paper that US officials are being "strung along" by Moscow. The Financial Times quotes a source as saying the deal is "very comfortable" for Russian President Vladimir Putin, while an official in Kyiv says it would be a "non-starter" for Ukraine.

What's described as a "North Sea stand-off" is the lead in the Daily Mirror, after a Russian spy ship on the edge of UK waters was accused of targeting RAF pilots with lasers. The Guardian describes the move as "part of a pattern of Russian incursions into Nato-controlled territory". According to the Sun, tensions are escalating amid "mounting fury" at Moscow. The paper's headline is: "Ship hits the fan".

"Trans guide to protect women is left in limbo", says the front page of the Times. It says it has seen new guidance, which suggests that places such as hospitals and gyms should be able to ban transgender people from single-sex spaces, based on how they look or behave. The paper accuses ministers of "sitting on the plan" from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, reporting that some in Whitehall are "concerned that Labour is delaying publication". But a government source dismisses that as "total nonsense".

The i Paper reports that ministers are planning to allow local authorities in London and south east England to raise council tax above the 5% cap without a public vote, to help them cover losses from what it calls a "funding shake-up". The paper says an overhaul will see grants diverted to areas with higher spending needs, mainly in the Midlands and north of England.

Ahead of the Budget next week, the Daily Express calls on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to keep the pension triple lock. The report highlights figures which suggest millions more pensioners could be plunged into poverty if the measure is scrapped. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, leads with a different set of statistics which it says deliver "an excoriating verdict" on Reeves. The paper says a "shock" YouGov poll has found that 0% of those surveyed believe the economy is in a "very good state".

English champions Bath battled hard but fell to a 45-34 defeat by Toulon in a compelling nine-try Champions Cup match at Stade Mayol.

Second-half tries from Gael Drean and former England back row Lewis Ludlam helped the hosts take a 38-27 lead in the closing stages.

Louie Hennessey ran a superb line to take Max Ojomoh's pass and race over to give Bath hope, but the French side drove Teddy Baubigny over in the corner in stoppage time for a fifth try that denied the visitors a losing bonus point.

Bath, who trailed 18-13 at half-time, did secure a try bonus point for their efforts.

Every side in Pool Two has won one match after two rounds but Johann van Graan's team, who won the Challenge Cup last year after making an early Champions Cup exit, are the only one to have two bonus points and lead the way with six points.

Bath were the only Prem side to lose on Sunday after Harlequins racked up 68 points against Bayonne, Bristol scored 61 against Pau and Northampton reached a half-century against the Bulls.

Champions Cup recap: Big wins for Bristol, Northampton and Harlequins but Bath fall short

Gael Drean scored Toulon's third try to keep the home side in the lead

Bath started their Champions Cup campaign with an emphatic win over Munster last weekend, while three-time champions Toulon were looking to bounce back after a poor defeat in Edinburgh.

Van Graan brought in 20-year-old Vilikesa Sela to replace injured England prop Will Stuart as Bath went toe to toe with Toulon's imposing pack.

Finn Russell's penalty kick gave Bath the lead but second row forward Brian Alainu'uese muscled over from a line-out move to put the hosts ahead.

Both sides traded penalties before Ted Hill burrowed between two defenders from a tap penalty to briefly give Bath the lead.

After Mateo Garcia's penalty levelled the scores at 13-13, three-time European champions Toulon regained the lead. Former Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler powered towards the posts before being hauled down, Toulon moved the ball wide and Juan Ignacio Brex strolled over.

Toulon thought they had scored again in the final action of the first half, but Bath held the ball up to keep the deficit to five points.

Garcia kicked another penalty as the hosts started to dominate up front in the second half but Bath dug deep to keep in touch. 

Scrum-half Tom Carr-Smith, making his first European start in place of captain Ben Spencer, was involved as Santiago Carreras dived over for the visitors' second try. 

Russell's conversion closed the gap to one point but back came Toulon. Sinckler again played a prominent role with a surging run and Toulon worked the ball to the rapid Drean, who restored the home side's eight-point cushion.

Bath turned to their bench and replacement Arthur Green grounded the ball from close range to cut the deficit.

But Ludlam buried over for Toulon's bonus-point try from a five-metre scrum, and Garcia's steely conversion from the touchline extended their lead to eight points once again.

Another Garica penalty stretched the lead to 11 but Hennessey's try showed Bath's resilience before a Toulon maul proved to be unstoppable as the hosts sealed victory.

Toulon's final try denied Bath a second bonus point

Bath face Castres away in their third Champions Cup pool match on 9 January before hosting Edinburgh in their final game on 16 January.

Toulon will be at home to Munster before travelling to Gloucester.

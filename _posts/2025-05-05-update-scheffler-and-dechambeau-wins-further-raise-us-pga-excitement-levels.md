According to new developments, Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors

Neither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.

Scheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.

DeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.

Scheffler claims emphatic first win of year

DeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win

Scheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.

In claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.

Scheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.

Everything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.

"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete," Scheffler said.

"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.

"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.

"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season."

DeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.

The 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.

And DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.

"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship," DeChambeau observed. "We're going to be battling it out."

The Texas-based Californian added: "There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to."

DeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.

We should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.

Still only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. "My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week," he said.

"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year."

The 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.

Spieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.

Let's dive into the details: Nicolas Jackson joined Chelsea from Villarreal in June 2023 for about Â£32m

Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson has been given a two-match ban for his red card in Friday's 3-1 Club World Cup defeat by Flamengo.

Jackson was dismissed just four minutes after coming on as a late substitute for a studs-up challenge on Flamengo defender Lucas Ayrton.

The Senegal forward was given an automatic one-match ban that rules him out of tonight's final group game against African side ES Tunis (02:00 BST).

But a Fifa disciplinary committee reviewed the incident and decided to extend the ban as it was deemed serious foul play, meaning Jackson will miss Chelsea's last-16 match should they progress.

The disciplinary committee's decision is final and cannot be appealed against.

Enzo Maresca's side need to avoid defeat by ES Tunis in Philadelphia to reach the knockout stage.

The dismissal was Jackson's second in four matches and means he is now suspended in two competitions - the Premier League and Club World Cup.

Alongside his eight yellow cards, it means Jackson has a combined record of 10 cards this season.

The former Villarreal player apologised on social media after the game, while both defender Marc Cucurella and Maresca revealed the striker said sorry in person to his team-mates after the match.

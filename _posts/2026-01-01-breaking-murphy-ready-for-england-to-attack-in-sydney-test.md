Experts revealed that Todd Murphy has taken 22 wickets in seven Tests

Australia spinner Todd Muphy is prepared to be a target for England in the final Ashes Test in Sydney.

Off-spinner Murphy, 25, could play at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) after Nathan Lyon was ruled out of the series with a hamstring injury.

Murphy played two matches in the 2023 Ashes and came in for some particularly tough treatment in the third Test at Headingley, but still ended up with seven wickets in the series at a better average and strike-rate than the rest of the Australia team.

"I'd say it's a guarantee that if I play they will be attacking against me," said Murphy. "That's how they've been playing, it's been positive cricket. It will be no different if I'm playing and bowling.

"You always have a chance when guys are coming after you - it does bring you into the game a little bit more. If that presents out there, no issues."

Meanwhile, Australia batter Usman Khawaja will speak to the media on Friday morning (21:15 GMT, Thursday) amid speculation he will announce his retirement.

The left-hander turned 39 last month and has faced a battle for his place in this Ashes series. He was was left out of the second and third Test, only to be reprieved in Adelaide when Steve Smith fell ill.

Khawaja was retained for the fourth Test and, after Sydney, Australia do not play another Test until August.

The SCG traditionally assists slow bowlers - three of the four leading Test wicket-takers there are Australia spinners Shane Warne, Stuart MacGill and Lyon.

But Murphy's inclusion on Sunday (23:30 GMT on Saturday) is not guaranteed because of a mixed weather forecast and the limited impact spin has had in this Ashes series.

Only nine wickets have fallen to spin in four games, meaning this series is on course to have the fewest wickets taken by spinners in an Ashes series of at least four Tests, beating the 21 of England's 3-1 victory in Australia in 2010-11. This series will also comfortably have the fewest combined overs of spin bowled in an Ashes series.

Murphy has taken 22 wickets in his seven Tests, though is yet to play at home.

"I still think there's a role to play for spin," said Murphy. "You're not going to be thrown the ball and your role is to take wickets, it might be to play a holding role so the fast bowlers can have a break and then come back."

Through a combination of green pitches and a Kookaburra ball offering greater assistance to seamers, spin has played a diminished role in Tests in Australia over the past decade.

Australia's number one spinner Lyon has seen the number of overs he has bowled in home series gradually fall.

England won the fourth Test in Melbourne inside two days to cut the series deficit to 3-1. The Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch had 10mm of grass, meaning Australia did not play a spinner and England's Will Jacks did not bowl.

Only in the third Test in Adelaide, when Jacks and Lyon shared eight wickets, has spin played a prominent part.

"You've got to find ways to still be effective out there and still be able to play a role for what the team needs," added Murphy.

Australia were able to train at the SCG on New Year's Day, after England's earlier session was hit by rain.

England's session was optional, and the only players in attendance who featured in Melbourne were captain Ben Stokes, Joe Root and Zak Crawley. Others spent time in the city with their families.

The tourists will make at least one change from the team that won in Melbourne, after seamer Gus Atkinson was ruled out with a hamstring injury. Matthew Potts is favourite to take his place.

Australia have named their provisional squad for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in February and March. Test captain Pat Cummins is included despite playing only one Ashes Test as he manages a back problem.

Fellow seamer Josh Hazlewood is also in after missing the entire Ashes with hamstring and Achilles tendon injuries.

Australia squad for T20 World Cup: Mitchell Marsh (capt), Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Kuhnemann, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Short, Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa.

Here’s what you need to know: Watch Hearts v Rangers highlights

21/12/25

Hearts "have arrived" as Scottish Premiership title contenders after beating Rangers for the second time this season, according to former Scotland striker Kris Boyd. 

And head coach Derek McInnes has warned "I expect us to get better" after the January transfer window.

The Edinburgh side stay six points clear of reigning champions Celtic at the top of the table after a 2-1 win over Rangers - a result that leaves the Ibrox club 12 points adrift in fourth place.

Hearts have not won the Scottish title since 1960, but are probably in their best position to do so since fading late on in a three-horse race with the Old Firm in 1998.

McInnes might be still reluctant to come out and say as much overtly, but pundits are certainly looking at Hearts now being genuine title contenders just a year since they were at the foot of the division.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Boyd kept his promise to switch allegiance from Hearts to Rangers should Danny Rohl's visitors lose at Tynecastle.

"This Hearts team is there - they have arrived!" said the former Ibrox striker. "They are going to go all the way. Rangers are out of it. They can forget it - 12 points is too much for them to claw back."

Celtic ended a run of four defeats in all competitions under new manager Wilfried Nancy with a 3-1 win over Aberdeen later in the day - but that victory as not without a scare after the 10-man visitors equalised with fewer than 20 minutes to play.

"It's not all rosy in the east end of Glasgow either and if Hearts can capitalise on that, they right now are favourites to lift the title," Boyd added.

A sticky run in November - during which they picked up three points from a possible 12 - caused their early lead to be whittled away by Celtic under Martin O'Neill.

But former Tynecastle midfielder Ryan Stevenson says McInnes' side have put that spell behind them with three straight victories over Celtic, Falkirk and now Rangers.

Hearts next head across the city for Saturday's derby with fifth-placed Hibs.

"I think in the changing room the belief would never have left," he told BBC Scotland. "Everything is so positive. 

"They will have to withstand pressure. They have to go to Easter Road next week for the derby against Hibs. Right now, they are dealing with it."

McInnes speaks as Hearts maintain lead at top of table

But what of Hearts' head coach himself?

McInnes is stressing his side need to get better if they are to remain in the title hunt.

"I certainly hope we can make this a special season," he said. 

"I am always hearing we are only at the top of the league because teams not being as good as they normally are, but our actual points tally is actually around where a team at the top of the table should be.

"I think there's more wins in us. I expect us to get better as we go along. 

"We just want the games to get bigger and bigger and, for Hearts to stay relevant, we just need to keep chalking off wins."

Hearts have scored in 16 of their 18 Premiership games - more often than any other team in the division - with Lawrence Shankland top scorer with nine after netting the second against Rangers.

The Scotland striker insisted Hearts "just need to concentrate on ourselves" rather than looking at the league table. 

"As soon as you start looking elsewhere, that can cause problems," he said. "So as long as you focus on getting three points every week, you'll be in a good place."

Shankland said it feels like people suggest "it is a massive game" every week now and he and his team-mates are relishing the challenge.

"That's enjoyable; it's a good pressure to have and it seems like the boys are thriving right now," he said.

"We're in a good place, good position and obviously we're going into the derby confident, so it's a good place to be."

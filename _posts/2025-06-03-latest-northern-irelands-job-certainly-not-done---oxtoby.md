Let's dive into the details: Tanya Oxtoby's Northern Ireland side lost 4-0 to Poland on Friday

Manager Tanya Oxtoby says her Northern Ireland side know the "job's certainly not done" in the Nations League.

Northern Ireland travel to Bosnia-Herzegovina knowing a win or draw would secure a promotion play-off with a League A side.

However, a defeat would open up a number of permutations with the Bosnians just three points behind Oxtoby's side in Group B1.

NI have won all three meetings with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past year, including a dramatic 3-2 win in the reverse Nations League fixture in February.

"We by no means expect to just turn up here and the result be ours," said Oxtoby.

"We need to make sure that we are fully focused and that we go 100mph after it." 

Oxtoby admitted it had been a "tough campaign" and a promotion play-off against a League A side would be a good reward for the work they have put in.

"From a playing group point of view and a staff point of view, I'd just be so happy for them because it's been a really, really tough window this window,.

"It's also been a tough campaign, and that reward for all the effort that everyone's put in for me be the most pleasing thing."

After the defeat on Friday, when Poland punished the hosts in a ruthless first half, Oxtoby says her youthful squad will be "right up for it" in Zenica.

"We know what Bosnia possess in terms of threats and we know what we're looking to do too.

"We can only concentrate on on ourselves, try to execute what we're going after and focus on the performance to give ourselves every opportunity to get the result.

"The ball is in our court, we know that we're in a really good position where we can affect our own destiny. 

"That's what we wanted going into this game."

It has been recently reported that Toone (centre) kissed her hands and pointed to the sky after scoring against Wales

England's Ella Toone and Beth Mead are more than just team-mates, after bonding over the grief of losing parents.

Both players were on the scoresheet in England's 6-1 victory over Wales, with midfielder Toone saying she is sure her dad and Mead's mum "will be up there with a few pints in their hands watching us".

Forward Mead, the player of the tournament at Euro 2022, lost her mum, June, to ovarian cancer in January 2023.

Toone's dad, Nick, was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after the Lionesses beat Germany to win Euro 2022 and died in September 2024.

Toone has previously spoken about the impact of losing her dad on an episode of The Tooney & Russo Show, stating she didn't "actually grieve" until she was sidelined with a hamstring injury last November.

Speaking after England's final Euro 2025 group match, she praised the support she has received from Mead, adding that she was "buzzing" that they could "both celebrate to the sky" against Wales.

"She has been amazing," said Toone, who scored England's second goal and provided two assists. "We have really bonded over such a terrible thing but it's nice to have someone who has been through it as well and who understands and knows exactly what is going on and what is going on in my head.

"We definitely have each other's backs. We are proud of each other and it's nice we are constantly talking about them. It's nice to have someone in the same situation and we know we are doing them proud."

Mead, who won the golden boot at Euro 2022, scored her first goal of the 2025 tournament against Wales

Mead, whose mum was her "biggest motivation", came off the bench to score England's fifth against Wales and described their goals as "special", particularly after both players struggled with their emotions in the tournament opener.

"We both said the first game we really struggled. You look to the stands for your person who was standing there and they are not there anymore. My mum was the first person I would look for in the stands, so I understand what Ella felt in that moment," said Mead. 

"It's special to be able to have that moment to think about them and dedicate it to them."

On her bond with Toone, she added: "I've been a shoulder to be there for her. There have been moments where she has asked, 'is this normal? Does that feel normal? Why am I thinking this?'. I'm like, 'it's completely normal, I've been there and I still feel it now'.

"We have conversations about it and talk so easy about it but ultimately I've had a bit longer to process it compared to her. We all deal with it differently but she is dealing with it pretty amazingly now."

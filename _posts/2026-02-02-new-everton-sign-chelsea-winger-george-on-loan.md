According to new developments, Tyrique George has featured four times in the Premier League for Chelsea this season - all as a substitute

Everton have signed Chelsea winger Tyrique George on loan for the rest of the season, with the option to make the move permanent in the summer.

George was understood to have attracted interest from another Premier League club and one in Europe.

The 19-year-old is a graduate of Chelsea's academy and has scored six goals in 37 appearances for the senior side.

"The fans here are exceptional. I know Evertonians are really passionate. They like hard work - and that's what I'm going to show," George said.

"The gaffer, David Moyes, was another reason [I wanted to join]. He's an amazing manager who has coached so many players, like Wayne Rooney, and players like that. I've had a brief conversation with him and he's an amazing person as well.

"I just want to enjoy it, learn under him and improve."

George joins after Moyes said Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish "probably" needs surgery on a fractured foot and is set to be "out for the season".

He is Everton's second signing of the winter window after Freiburg's Merlin Rohl joined on a season-long loan deal with an obligation to buy for Â£17.3m in 2026.

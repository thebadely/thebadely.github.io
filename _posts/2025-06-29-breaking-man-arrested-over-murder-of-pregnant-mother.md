Let's dive into the details: A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a woman in Donaghadee, County Down.

Sarah Montgomery, a 27-year-old mother of two, was pregnant at the time of her death. 

Police received a report at approximately 14:15 BST on Saturday of an unconscious woman with a serious injury inside a house in the Elmfield Walk area of the town. Ms Montgomery was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Police cordons remain in place. 

Det Ch Insp Tom Phillips said: "Enquiries are at an early stage into this deeply tragic case. 

"Our thoughts are also with Sarah's family during this incredibly difficult time – as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened." 

He added that the family are being supported by "specially trained officers". 

North Area Ch Insp Yvonne McManus added: "We understand this news will cause shock and concern within the community.

"We recognise the profound impact that violence against women and girls has on individuals, families and wider society.

"Addressing this issue remains a key priority, and we are committed to engaging directly with the local community to offer support, build trust, and help people feel safe."

The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said a rapid response paramedic and an emergency crew were sent to an incident in Enfield Walk at about 14:14 on Saturday.

"Following assessment and initial treatment, no patients were taken from the scene," a statement added.

First Minister Michelle O'Neill paid tribute to Ms Montgomery, adding that her thoughts were with her family and loved ones at this "heartbreaking" time.

"A young woman with her whole life ahead of her, taken in the most devastating way," the Sinn Féin vice-president posted on X.

"Another family left shattered. Two children left without their mummy."

Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said her heart goes out to Ms Montgomery's children, family and friends.

"My heart breaks for Sarah. Just horrifying - another woman murdered," the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member added.

She said the work to tackle violence against women and girls is long term, "but I am so angry at every single murder and act of violence. It must stop".

North Down MP Alex Easton described the incident as "horrific" and said there is a deep sense of shock within the community.

"It's absolutely horrible, there's two small kids without a mum and who knows what the future holds for them," he said.

"Certainly I hope the local community will help them. It's an absolutely tragedy, just appalling."

Easton also offered his sympathies to Ms Montgomery's family.

"I was speaking to local residents and they're just so gutted," he added.

"She was a lovely quiet individual and for this to happen in the local area is just a complete shock for everybody."

Alliance councillor Hannah Irwin described it as a "heartbreaking" tragedy.

"I didn't know Sarah personally but... I feel somewhat connected in that she's a 27 year old woman and I'm standing here as a 27 year old woman and I just can't imagine what she would have gone through and what her family and children are going through right now," she added.

Irwin said the incident once again shines a light on the issue of violence against women and girls in Northern Ireland.

"Unfortunately, Sarah isn't the first woman to pass away in Donaghadee in the past year, or in Northern Ireland. 

"I've almost lost count on how many women have passed away in tragic circumstances since 2020."

Councillor John Hennessy said the "local community is in complete shock" at this "devastating incident".

"My thoughts go out to Sarah's family and loved ones, especially her children."

North Down assembly member Stephen Dunne said he is "deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating news".

"My thoughts and heartfelt sympathies are with Sarah's family, her two young children, and all those who knew and loved her.

"This horrific incident has shocked the entire local community, and I know many will be grieving and trying to come to terms with this loss."

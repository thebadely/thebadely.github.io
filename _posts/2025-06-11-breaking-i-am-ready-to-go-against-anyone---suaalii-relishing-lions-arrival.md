Experts revealed that Suaalii was tempted to switch codes, with the Lions series and the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia in mind

Australia's big-money backline signing Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii says he will be ready to face the British and Irish Lions this summer, despite jaw surgery that made it so hard to eat he lost 5kg in weight.

The 21-year-old was recruited from rugby league side Sydney Roosters on a three-year-deal worth a reported A$5.35m (Â£2.6m) and made his professional union debut in the Wallabies' win over England in November.

However, he fractured his jaw in a collision with Waratahs' team-mate Andrew Kellaway in May, raising fears he could be out of contention for the Lions series.

"Yeah, I'll be fully fit for the Lions," said Suaalii, assessing himself as "97%" of the way back already.

"I was a little bit worried [that I might miss the Lions tour].

Can 'freakish' Suaalii revive the Wallabies?

"It's such an important time for myself and Australian rugby and I want to be playing, so obviously I was a little bit of a nerves. But I had surgery maybe three weeks ago now and looking good going into the Lions."

Suaalii said he had worn a face mask to hide his swollen face after his operation and his weight dipped as he struggled to eat.

"I've put it all back on now," he added. "I've been eating heaps thanks to my mum and I've had my family around me to help me stay on track."

Australia were beaten 27-13 by Scotland, with Suaalii forced off with an injury sustained in a first-half tackle on Tuipulotu

Suaalii refused to stoke the personal duel that has emerged between him and Scotland centre Sione Tuipulotu.

He hit Tuipulotu with a big tackle in the first half of the Wallabies' defeat at Murrayfield in the autumn, sparking an exchange of words.

Suaalii, who suffered a wrist injury in their collision, was heard to say, apparently to Tuipulotu, that he would "see you next time" as he left the field.

"Not really to be honest," he said, when asked if such personal battles fuel him.

"I am really just focused on what I can bring best for the team, but anyone in the Lions I am ready to go against them."

After initially crossing codes, Suaalii played at outside centre, but his most recent outings for the Waratahs have been at full-back, where he was named in the Super Rugby Pacific team of 2025.

"It makes you a better rugby player, seeing the game from a different perspective always helps you," he added. 

"I am very confident in playing wing, centre and full-back."

Suaalii is targeting a return to action in the Wallabies warm-up Test against Fiji on 6 July. The Tests against the Lions take place on 19 and 26 July and 2 August, kicking off at 11:00 BST.

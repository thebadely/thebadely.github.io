Experts revealed that Hansen was injured in Connacht's URC defeat against Bulls on Friday

Connacht wing Mack Hansen has been ruled out of Ireland's squad for the autumn internationals.

British and Irish Lion Hansen was forced off in the closing stages of his side's 28-27 defeat by the Bulls in the United Rugby Championship on Friday.

In a squad update issued on Monday, Ireland confirmed he had suffered an aggravation of a foot injury and is ruled out of their upcoming games against New Zealand, Japan, Australia and world champions South Africa.

Fellow Lion Bundee Aki (hip) and Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw (groin) will continue to be assessed but will travel with the squad on Tuesday to Chicago before the game against the All Blacks on 1 November.

Munster's uncapped centre Tom Farrell and Leinster's Jimmy O'Brien have been added to the squad with Edwin Edogbo (concussion) and Brian Gleeson (elbow), who had been due to travel with the squad to Chicago, missing out through injury.

Returning head coach Andy Farrell is already without injured Lions duo Joe McCarthy and Hugo Keenan.

It remains unclear whether captain Caelan Doris will be fit to face New Zealand after recently returning to Leinster training following surgery on a shoulder injury.

After facing the All Blacks at Soldier Field in a rematch of their 2016 meeting, Ireland host Japan, Australia and South Africa in Dublin.

It has been recently reported that Eubank Jr has won 35 pro fights and lost three, but has never held a recognised world title

Harlem Eubank would prefer his cousin, Chris Eubank Jr, to chase a legacy-defining fight against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez rather than revisit his rivalry with Conor Benn.

The unbeaten welterweight says if Eubank Jr does fight Benn again, however, the weight discrepancy between the two Britons must be addressed. 

Eubank Jr outpointed Benn in a grudge match at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, more than two years after their original 2022 bout was cancelled due to Benn's failed drug tests.

A two-fight deal was in place, but Harlem is unsure whether a rematch will materialise.

"There's obviously a lot of money there for it, so potentially," he told BBC Sport.

"But Chris is 35 now and I'd like to see him take the Canelo fight and sail into the sunset.

"It's hard, because all the big opportunities come near the end of a career and there's always a fishhook dangling to keep you there, but I'd rather see him take the biggest fight in the sport and bow out."

'Fight of the century' - Alvarez-Crawford date confirmed

Soap opera twists and fatherly love - but what next for Eubank and Benn?

However, any potential clash with Mexican superstar Alvarez would likely have to wait until 2026. The undisputed super-middleweight champion will defend his belts against Terence Crawford in September.

Harlem, 31, also criticised the weight stipulations that surrounded the first fight. 

Eubank Jr - naturally the bigger man - appeared drained during fight week and was restricted by a rehydration clause which meant neither fighter was allowed to put on more than 10lb from the 11st 6lb limit at the weigh-in. 

He was fined Â£375,000 after missing the mark at the first weigh-in by just 0.05lb, before successfully making weight at a second check-in on the morning of the fight.

"Weight games should never be appropriate in a sport like boxing," Harlem added.

"People can get hurt, people can be legally damaged. Trying to weaken an opponent with rehydration clauses and these types of things should be eradicated from the sport."

Benn (right) lost for the first time in 24 pro bouts when he was outpointed by Eubank Jr

Eubank Jr's victory over Benn settled a feud more than three decades in the making, sparked by their fathers' famous rivalry in the 1990s.

The bout came after Benn's two failed drug tests, which led to a lengthy investigation. Benn has always denied intentionally doping and had his suspension lifted in November 2024.

Unbeaten welterweight Harlem, who stopped Tyrone McKenna in March with his cousin and uncle, Chris Eubank Sr, watching on, will challenge Jack Catterall in Manchester on 5 July.

Having previously called out Benn himself, Harlem believes former world-title challenger Catterall is on a different level

"He [Benn] lost to Jr by a wide margin in an entertaining fight," he said.

"I gave him props for going the distance and continuing the battle, but in terms of boxing, my next fight is a whole different level.

"Jack has operated at world level for many years and is leaps and bounds ahead of Conor Benn."

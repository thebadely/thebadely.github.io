Let's dive into the details: A £160,000 grant is available for organisations to help vulnerable people this winter.

Plymouth City Council said it had the money from the government to give to non-profit groups in grants of between £2,100 and £5,350.

Councillor Chris Penberthy said the grants were to support warm spaces and community connections.

The city council said the money could be applied for via its website before 26 September.

The funds were part of the council's £4m household support from the government to help people with the cost of living during 2025 and 2026.

Penberthy said: "We are doing this because we know people in Plymouth are still feeling the pressure of rising costs and heating your home in winter makes life harder."

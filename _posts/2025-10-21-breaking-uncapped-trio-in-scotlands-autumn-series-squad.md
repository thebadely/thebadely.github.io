Let's dive into the details: Alexander Masibaka, Liam McConnell and Harri Morris have been called up by Gregor Townsend

Uncapped forwards Alexander Masibaka, Liam McConnell and Harri Morris have been named in Scotland's autumn internationals squad.

Edinburgh hooker Harri Morris and club-mate Liam McConnell, who can feature in the back row, could play in the matches against the United States (1 November), New Zealand (8 November), Argentina (16 Novemeber) and Tonga (23 November).

Australia-born number eight Masibaka, of Montpellier, qualifies for Scotland through his mother and featured in a non-cap international against Maori All Blacks  in July.

British and Irish Lions centre Sione Tuipulotu will captain Gregor Townsend's side for this series while Edinburgh skipper Magnus Bradbury returns to the squad.

"Magnus has played really well now for a number of months," Townsend told Scottish Rugby of Bradbury, who was last capped in 2022.

"He's grown into a leader over the last few years. He's going to get an opportunity now and it's great to have him back.

"[Alex Masibaka has] now been involved in the past two campaigns, played really well against Maori All Blacks and has started the season very well for Montpellier. His explosive running, his power and also his work-rate are key attributes that can add to our squad."

While Masibaka has been called up to squads before, McConnell and Morris are relative newcomers - although Townsend thinks they are both ready for Test rugby.

"I've been really impressed [with Liam] and it backed up what we were hearing from Edinburgh players and coaches," Townsend told BBC Scotland. "He's always been a player that's been really passionate about the game, especially playing for Scotland Under-20s.

"We feel that this experience will kick him on again but also if he's in the squad, that's because we already think he's good enough to play Test level. He's now got to go and grab that opportunity."

The opening Test against USA is scheduled outside the international window so Scotland will only be allowed to select players from Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors for that match.

While McConnell has started all four URC games for Edinburgh this season, teammate Morris is yet to play a minute. In the last campaign, he only featured four times from the bench.

"Whenever we've seen him play and train, he brings 100% aggression, physicality," Townsend said of the 24-year-old. "He's really worked on the set-piece side of his game. 

"We have a lot of young hookers competing hard. Gregor Hiddleston's not available, he's injured, Seb Stephen is one of a few really young hookers coming through. 

"But right now we think Harri is suited to test rugby. Again, like Liam, we want to see him in this environment, see how he thrives with the opportunity."

Undoubtedly, the glamour fixture of Scotland's autumn follows the USA match.

New Zealand remain Scotland's 'white whale' - the only nation they have faced but never beaten. Yet, there is more optimism about the upcoming clash than usual.

In the recent Rugby Championship, the All Blacks lost to Argentina in South America for the very first time, and then suffered their heaviest ever defeat to the hands of South Africa.

Townsend, though, doesn't buy into the 'vulnerable' tag. 

"The aura is still there," he said. "The black jersey, the haka, their quality of player. If you ever take your eye off a New Zealand team, or think they're maybe not the same team as it were, you're in for a surprise and a nasty shock with the quality they have. 

"We'll be respecting them fully.

"But there is a lot of competition now at the top end of world rugby and we believe we've got the right to be in that conversation as well, as a team that can beat anybody on their day."

Scotland came close in 2022. They had a nine-point lead with 20 minutes to go, but a late capitulation ended any hope of a famous first win.

They weren't far away in 2017 either, as a late comeback wasn't enough to claw back the points in a 17-22 loss.

"We've been desperately disappointed on two occasions not to have done it, certainly in the last game when we got ourselves into a winning position," Townsend said.

"The one before, we had a chance right at the end of the game. It was a classic game, but we know we'll have to be at our very best or close to our very best.

"That's all you want to work with as a coaching group, pushing the players and the players driving it themselves, to bring out your best performances against the top teams in the world."

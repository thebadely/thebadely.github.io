According to new developments, Stef Reid grew up as a sports-obsessed child, dreaming of playing rugby internationally. But on the eve of her 16th birthday, her life changed forever.

Severe propeller lacerations from a horrific boat accident left doctors with no choice but to amputate her right foot.

Initially she continued to pursue rugby, but her agility and speed weren't the same and she grew tired of comparing her performance to when she had both feet.

"I didn't want to give up on my goal just because I was an amputee, but life is constantly changing and we have to update our goals instead of forcing them to work in a reality that no longer exists," she says. 

So she moved on from rugby and took up athletics. Using a light, springy carbon-fibre blade on her right leg, she eventually became a world champion Paralympic long jumper and sprinter for both Canada and Great Britain - winning medals, breaking records and receiving an MBE.

She's now retired from professional sport, but has shown a similar adaptability and resilience in her new career which includes acting, modelling and broadcasting including competing in Dancing on Ice.

Now she's campaigning for big brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma to sell single shoes rather than pairs. 

In part it's about cost - high-end running shoes cost around £200, and when she was competing she only needed one but had to buy two, meaning she wasted hundreds of pounds on shoes she never wore.

But her biggest motivation - is the principle. Many of the big brands proudly display models with blades in their shop windows, but don't sell shoes individually for athletes like Stef.

"I loved the bladed mannequins, and I wish 15-year-old Stef had seen those.

"But now I want retailers to match their inclusive imagery with the actual buying experience".

Stef isn't alone. While she wears two shoes with her day-to-day prosthetic, many other amputees don't.

And beyond disability, thousands of people whose feet are different sizes are also affected by having to buy two shoes of the same size rather than two singles.

Nike launched a single shoe programme last year, letting customers buy one shoe at half price at select stores. However this is not clearly advertised, requires the customer to contact the care support team and is not available online.

When Stef raised the issue, she was not pointed to the scheme but instead offered a one-time 15% discount. "That's not much use in the long term, as I'm always going to have one foot". 

Adidas, which equip the British Paralympic team, also do not sell single shoes online. However they say it is possible to buy a single shoe in some stores, depending on stock. The company added it is in the "advanced stages" of finalising a comprehensive policy.

Puma meanwhile, does not sell any single shoes in store or online and, like Decathlon, did not respond to a request for comment.

While Nike and Adidas have made positive steps towards addressing the issue, Stef thinks sports brands should sell single shoes at all their shops and online as standard practice. 

Some smaller businesses and grassroots organisations are already proving it is possible.

High street footwear company Schuh sells single shoes for half the price of a pair, while shoe chain Office also allows you to buy odd sized pairs of shoes through their outlet site.

And then there's small scale solutions such as Jo's Odd Shoes, founded by Jo O'Callaghan who lost her right leg to complex regional pain syndrome.

The condition makes it too painful to wear a prosthetic limb, leaving her, like many amputees, only needing one of a pair of shoes.

She set up a Facebook Group where members could swap or donate spare shoes. Many retailers also donate shoes to the scheme.

The items are free for members, aside from a small fee for postage and packaging.

It's a service that air sport athlete Jack Pimblett has benefited from.

Born with talipes, or club foot, which stunted the growth of his right foot and leg, he struggled to find two shoes which fitted well when he was younger.

He often had to put cotton wool in his shoes to fill the extra space.

As an adult, he manages by buying a combination of junior and adult shoe sizes - buying a right shoe in size 5 and a left shoe in size 7.

But this imposes a significant financial strain, with Jack typically spending around £150 for two pairs of shoes.

"It would be nice to be able to buy shoes that fit… [without] paying twice," he says.

Stef acknowledges the change she's calling for takes time and money, but urges firms to push forward.

 "All it takes is that first step forward in the right direction," she says.

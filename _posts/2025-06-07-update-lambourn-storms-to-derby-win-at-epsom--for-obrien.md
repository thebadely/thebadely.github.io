According to new developments, Lambourn made nearly all the running to win the 246th running of the Derby

Lambourn stormed away from his rivals to win the Derby at Epsom and give Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien a record-extending 11th win in the Classic.

The 13-2 chance, ridden by Wayne Lordan, set a relentless gallop and could not be caught.

Outsider Lazy Griff (50-1) was three and three quarter lengths back in second, with Tennessee Stud (28-1) third.

Lambourn had been seen as the outsider of O'Brien's three contenders in the build-up to the race.

But favourite Delacroix - the pick of stable jockey Ryan Moore - could only finish ninth, while The Lion In Winter was 14th.

Lambourn was another victor to break from 'lucky stall' 10 - the 12th winner since 1977 to start from that gate.

He was sent to the front early by Lordan and his stamina proved crucial as he ran out an impressive winner in the race's 246th running.

"Wayne gave him an incredible ride. He's been a great fella, he's done so much hard work through all the years." said O'Brien.

The trainer was winning the Derby for a third year running and completing a Classic double after landing the Oaks with Minnie Hauk on Friday. He also won the Coronation Cup at Epsom with Jan Breughel.

It was a repeat of the Chester Vase result where Lambourn won from Lazy Griff last month.

"I couldn't understand why he was such a huge price. It's safe to say the Chester form held up well," said Charlie Johnston, trainer of the runner-up.

Eighteen runners went to post for the Derby after 2,000 Guineas winner Ruling Court was a late withdrawal, with trainer Charlie Appleby concerned about the rain-softened ground.

Ruling Court will now be aimed at the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot later in the month.

Lambourn is a son of 2014 Derby winner Australia, who was himself a son of the 2001 victor Galileo as owners Coolmore continued their dominance of the big race.

Victory for Lordan was reward for a jockey who is an integral part of O'Brien's Ballydoyle set-up.

The 43-year-old has bounced back after a fall in the Irish Derby two years ago where he was knocked out and left with fractures to his legs and elbow,

"I had a lot of tests to pass, it took me eight months to get back," said the rider, who was winning the Derby for the first time at the ninth attempt.

"This is one of the greatest races. For any jockey that starts out, all they ever want to do is win a Derby. I'm in a lucky position that I get to ride a horse like this."

Lambourn left his rivals trailing in the Classic at Epsom

Lambourn is now odds-on favourite to follow up in the Irish Derby later this month, and considered a leading contender for September's St Leger at Doncaster.

Pride Of Arras, the Dante Stakes winner at York trained by Ralph Beckett, was backed into second favourite for the Derby at 4-1 but could only finish 17th although stablemate Stanhope Gardens was fifth, just behind French contender New Ground.

While the Derby is the richest flat race in Britain, with a total purse of Â£1.5m, and described as the ultimate test of the thoroughbred, its popularity in recent times has been under pressure.

Warnings of thunderstorms for the 2025 fixture will have affected the size of the crowd, with the in-field at the Surrey track â where entry is free - noticeably quieter than in previous years.

Admission prices and a reduced profile for the contest have been cited as factors which saw the number of paying spectators fall from 48,000 in 2004 to 27,000 last year.

According to new developments, Marcus Rashford (left) and Luis Diaz (right) have been linked with moves to Barcelona

Barcelona sporting director Deco says the club "like" Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford and Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.

Reports in Spain this week have linked Colombia international Diaz with a move to the Catalans, while Rashford was holding out for a transfer to the La Liga club in January before joining Aston Villa on loan. 

While there is no indication that Liverpool will listen to offers for Diaz, who has two years remaining on his contract, Rashford is available for around Â£40m.

"We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players," Deco told Catalan radio station RAC1, external.

"When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team."

Barcelona tied manager Hansi Flick down to a new deal following their La Liga title success last week.

Deco says the club's priority before looking to sign a new winger will be renewals for players such as Lamine Yamal, Pedri and Gavi.

"Our big priority is to strengthen what we have at home with the renewals of Pedri, Gavi, (Ronald) Araujo, Raphinha, (Jules) Kounde," added the former Chelsea midfielder.

"I understand that when people talk about signings, they always think about players coming from abroad, but for me, renewals are also signings. Lamine (renewing) is the best signing in history. 

"Then, if the team can be improved. From what we've seen this season, we need a player with a different profile to what we have to help the strikers. 

"Fermin (Lopez) has played as a winger and has done well. The composition of the squad also depends on the market."

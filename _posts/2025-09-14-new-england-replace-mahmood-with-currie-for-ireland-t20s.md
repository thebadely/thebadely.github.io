Experts revealed that Scott Currie took 27 wickets for Hampshire in this summer's T20 Blast

Hampshire seamer Scott Currie has been chosen to replace the injured Saqib Mahmood in England's squad for the T20 series in Ireland.

Currie, who was born in Poole, Dorset, has previously been capped by Scotland.

Mahmood, 28, has been ruled out with a knee injury and is set to undergo minor surgery that will also keep him out of England's white-ball series in New Zealand in October.

The fast bowler, who was part of the Oval Invincibles side that won The Hundred, has worked himself back into England contention in the last year after a lengthy spell out with a back injury.

But Mahmood's latest setback denies him the chance to further press his claims for inclusion in England's squad for the T20 World Cup that starts in February, in India and Sri Lanka.

For Currie, a first England call-up rounds off a superb summer in which he has impressed in The Hundred and the T20 Blast.

The 24-year-old reached the final of the Blast with Hampshire, taking 27 wickets at 19.33 across the competition, with a further nine wickets at 19.66 for Manchester Originals in The Hundred.

If he plays in any of the three T20s against Ireland, it would not be Currie's first international experience because the Dorset-born quick played three one-day matches for Scotland in 2024.

Should he make his England debut against Ireland, International Cricket Council (ICC) regulations state that Currie would be ineligible to play for Scotland for three years.

England have named an understrength squad for the series, which begins on Wednesday, 17 September at Malahide, with white-ball captain Harry Brook and other all-format players rested.

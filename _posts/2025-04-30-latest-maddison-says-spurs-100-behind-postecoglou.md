We're behind the manager 100% - Maddison backs Postecoglou

James Maddison says Tottenham's squad are "100%" behind manager Ange Postecoglou and can still turn their season into "something very special".

Spurs are 16th in the Premier League table after a dismal domestic campaign and pressure is mounting on Postecoglou despite their contrasting fortunes in Europe.

The North London club, who have not won a trophy in 17 years, host Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday.

Attacking midfielder Maddison, 28, acknowledges the club's disappointing season but says the narrative surrounding the manager is "not healthy".

"We are behind the manager 100%," said Maddison. "I think he's a great man. We have had a poor season, especially in the league. We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable.

"He's my manager, he's my gaffer and I respect him an awful amount. The narrative [of Postecoglou's job being under threat] is something we players are trying to keep away from because it's not healthy.

"I just know that I come into work every day and see the lads listening and taking on the messages on how he wants us to play and doing the best for this club and we are in a real good position in Europe, where we can still have a special season under his management.

"I will continue to do that until the day he isn't here."

Spurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to "relish the challenge" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece.

"It's huge," the England midfielder added. 

"When you get to the end of your career and you look back, there's not many times a player has been in European semi-finals. Maybe once or twice if you are lucky.

"We need to use that. We are in the final four in a massive competition in Europe and use that to have a great tie on Thursday and in Bodo as well.

"We've got a real special opportunity. There's obviously been a lot of talk about form and being a poor season, but we have the opportunity to do something very special. 

"We've earned it and we deserve to be here. It is a challenge we are going to relish."

Bodo/Glimt reached the semi-finals with victory over Lazio on penalties in the last round and Postecoglou has dismissed his side's tag as favourites.

"Bodo are there on merit," said the Australian manager.

"They are there because they are a good football team. It doesn't matter where you come from. I come from the other side of the world where football is the fourth sport, so I don't underestimate anyone.

"You say they are a small club and we are big club, it doesn't matter. We are two clubs in the semi-final of a European competition and they have earned the right to be there.

"They have done very well to get there and we are going to treat them with the respect they deserve. At the same time, make sure we go in there and give it our best performance."

The 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being "diminished" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.

He added: "I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.

"I have seen some people saying it is the equivalent of Manchester United winning the FA Cup, no. Not on any planet is it equivalent. That is suggesting that maybe we are not worthy of Champions League.

"Things are there that are designed to diminish what is ahead of us, which is an unbelievable opportunity. Irrespective of how this season has gone, we have generations of fans who want this more than anything else - to share this with the people that they love, a special moment supporting their football club.

"We could be flying in the league, but it wouldn't make this opportunity any different. The opportunity is the same and I have made that clear to the players."

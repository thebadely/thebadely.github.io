Here’s what you need to know: Parts of Scotland enjoyed the most recent white Christmas in 2023

Are you dreaming of a white Christmas? With the big day a week away, it is possible that some of us might have some festive snow - but only just.

After a couple of weeks of milder conditions it's about to turn noticeably colder. Temperatures for many parts of the UK may be a degree or two below the average for this time of year, hitting the 6-9C mark.

The drop will be a result of an influx of cold air from eastern Europe.

And if there are some small changes to that, there is a slight chance that even colder air from Scandinavia might come this way, and the possibility that any showers falling in eastern areas might turn to sleet or even snow.

The change in fortunes is down to a high pressure system which is going to build close to the north of the UK and a low pressure one forming around France or Spain. 

Although they will not be directly over the UK, the precise position of the centres of these highs and lows will determine the direction of the wind. In turn, that will influence how cold the air will be and therefore the chances of snow falling.

 A change in wind direction will bring colder weather just in time for Christmas 

As well as becoming much colder generally in time for Christmas it will probably be quite cloudy with showers developing over the North Sea and affecting eastern areas. 

The best of any sunshine would be in the north and west but there will be also be a risk of some morning frost and fog. 

Weather for the week ahead 

Will it be a White Christmas?

Join BBC Weatherâs Carol Kirkwood, Matt Taylor and Barra Best, along with famous faces Jeremy Vine and Lucy Porter, to explore where our fascination with a white Christmas comes from.

Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult.

Currently the forecast is for east-southeasterly winds but there is a very small chance that we get east-northeasterlies instead.

This small change in wind direction could then pull in much colder air from Scandinavia resulting in showers over eastern areas that could turn to sleet or snow in places. 

Although a white Christmas is still unlikely for most of us, it can't completely be ruled out just yet. 

Either way, very wet weather is off the Christmas menu this year. This spell of quieter spell of weather will be very much welcomed in areas which have recently seen heavy rain such as Cumbria and south Wales.

The definition of a white Christmas is just a single snowflake recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 weather observing stations.

Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day does not count.

An "official white Christmas" has happened more often than not since 1960, but new analysis of Met Office data by the BBC shows that locally, snow falling on Christmas Day is rare for most of us - and getting rarer.

The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations and, very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.

Here’s what you need to know: Seven new shops for Labubu dolls are to open in the UK this year, following the prime minister's trip to China.

Chinese toy maker Pop Mart has confirmed it will open a flagship shop on Oxford Street in London's West End, as well as shops in Cardiff and Birmingham, before opening 20 more shops in Europe in 2026.

The announcement is part of a package of deals announced by the UK government, including on whisky and cars, which officials claim is worth £2.2bn in export deals.

Some have expressed concerns about Sir Keir's visit to China, arguing the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.

Labubus are furry dolls wearing a signature spiky-toothed grin and became a viral purchase last summer, with celebrity fans including Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian.

The legions of fans are happy to queue to snap up the dolls, although to many their appeal is hard to explain. 

But their popularity has been a boon to Chinese soft power, with state news agency Xinhua saying Labubu "shows the appeal of Chinese creativity, quality and culture in a language the world can understand".

Pop Mart founder Grant Wang, who expects to bring 150 new jobs to the UK, said: "London stands at the heart of the global creative ecosystem, and we are thrilled to plant our European roots here."

Sir Keir has made the first trip to China by a UK prime minister for eight years in an effort to thaw relations and cement trade deals with the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.

On the final day of his three-day visit to Beijing, he announced an estimated  £2.2bn in export deals, as well as new investment.

This includes a cut in tariffs on Scottish whisky exports to China, estimated to be worth £250m to the UK economy over the next five years, which will come into force on Monday.

The prime minister also met the chairman of car manufacturer Chery, who confirmed the company will open a European headquarters in Liverpool.

However, the Conservatives have argued Sir Keir's trip was not in the national interest and Reform UK has called on him to reject trade deals with China until British citizen Jimmy Lai is released from prison.

Responding to critics, Sir Keir said: "Engaging with China, is how we secure growth for British businesses, support good jobs at home, and protect our national security."

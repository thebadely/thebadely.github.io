It has been recently reported that When Anne and Ross Campbell were watching the news on the night of 21 December 1988, they already had "go-bags" ready.

The Ayrshire-based couple were part of the Radio Amateurs' Emergency Network (Raynet), a UK-wide radio communications service.

Staffed by volunteers, it was formed in the aftermath of the North Sea flood in 1953 with a simple aim: during major events and emergencies, licensed Raynet operators would step in to provide essential radio communications.

When news broke that an aircraft had crashed in a small Dumfries and Galloway town, Anne and Ross got the call from their local controller: "You're on standby for Lockerbie."

At the time of the disaster, Anne and Ross, along with friends Tom Stewart and William Jamieson were all keen radio enthusiasts in their 20s and 30s.

And they were all members of Ayrshire's Raynet chapter.

"You worked away, doing exercises for the council and road races, but you always had in the back of your mind, there could come a general emergency," said Ross.

He had been involved in the group for a couple of years at the time but added: "You never imagined something like Lockerbie."

Pan Am 103 was flying from Heathrow to New York when a bomb exploded in the skies above the town, killing all 259 passengers and crew on board – as well as 11 people on the ground.

It remains the biggest terror attack to have taken place on British soil.

As part of the search and rescue efforts, hundreds of volunteers arrived at the scene to help – including many from Raynet.

Their expertise – and equipment – was desperately needed.

Ross said: "Strathclyde Police radios had their own frequency. 

"Dumfries and Galloway Police had a separate one.

"Every police service had their own, as did ambulance services, so they couldn't communicate with one another."

Each search party at Lockerbie was teamed with a Raynet operator who would send messages back to Lockerbie Academy, the disaster control room.

They accompanied search and rescue dogs, air accident investigation units, the FBI, and the police.

Volunteer Tom, who had been in the fire service for 10 years, made the call to Anne, Ross and William to tell them to report to the scene the following morning.

Anne and Ross were both stationed at Tundergarth, in the field where the plane's nose cone lay.

"I still remember the press, with huge lenses, leaning over the fence, trying to get pictures of them bringing the bodies out," said Anne.

"That horrified me, I just thought these people deserve a wee bit of respect."

While Tom was used to scenes of emergency from his time in the fire service, nothing could have prepared him for what he saw.

"The devastation, it was horrendous," he said.

"For other members of the group that didn't have that background, it was harder."

Tom's main role was with search and rescue dog teams, which had been tasked with searching for bodies and collecting debris and evidence from the crash.

"I can still remember the Chinook helicopters flying above.

"They were bringing out body bags and rescue equipment.

"We sent messages back, and the helicopter came with bags, and they came and took them away."

For William, one of the most striking moments was passing on the message that his team had found evidence of an explosion.

"We came across a baggage container, and from the damage to the container, they knew instantly there was a bomb.

"I was asked if I could radio in saying we had found evidence of a bomb, but because the press were there, they were going to be listening, and I advised them I couldn't send that message because it would be on the telly before we even got back.

"We changed it to asking for an urgent recovery of that item."

Earlier this year, William returned to Lockerbie for the first time in almost 38 years to pay his respects.

"I'd always meant to go back, but I've never been, because it does bring up memories," he said.

William, who was 22 at the time, said one of his most harrowing memories was finding a passenger still in their seat. 

"To find something like that and knowing there was nothing you could do to help them, it was certainly upsetting."

Tom, who returned with his three friends, still struggles with what he experienced.

"I'd still never seen anything on that scale. 

"I can still remember seeing people's letters and personal belongings and thinking that was someone's son, someone's daughter."

Anne said: "I'm proud that I managed to have a wee bit of input. 

"But there were a lot of people who did a lot more than we did."

All four feel the role of volunteers needs to be acknowledged.

Search and rescue teams and their dogs, the Salvation Army, the Women's Royal Voluntary Service, and locals from the town were all involved.

"They gave their free time willingly at Lockerbie and went back home and yet nobody knows of them," Ross said.

Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Houston from Police Scotland's organised crime, counter terrorism and intelligence unit has thanked Raynet for the role they played.

He told BBC Scotland: "The assistance Raynet provided the police and other emergency services in the aftermath of the darkest day Lockerbie has ever endured will never be forgotten.

"We are grateful for their support and expertise that afforded vital communications between emergency services at such a critical time.

"Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those who lost loved ones in 1988 and who continue to show incredible dignity and strength."

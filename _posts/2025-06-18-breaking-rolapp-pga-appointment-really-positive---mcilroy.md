It has been recently reported that Rory McIlroy will play the Travelers Championship after a disappointing US Open at Oakmont

Rory McIlroy believes the experience new PGA Tour chief executive Brian Rolapp will bring to the role will be "amazing".

Rolapp will be the tour's first CEO and will gradually take over the day-to-day running from commissioner Jay Monahan, who will step down after 10 years in the role in 2026.

He has more than 20 years of experience with the National Football League (NFL) and helped with the global expansion of American football as chief media and business officer.

McIlroy said he is yet to meet Rolapp but that his appointment is a "really positive thing" for the PGA Tour.

"He's certainly said all the right things and he has an amazing background with two decades in the NFL," McIlroy said.

"He's helped them expand internationally and help them become the behemoth they have become.

"For him to bring that experience, I think it will be amazing and it's great that Jay is there to help with the smooth transition."

Rolapp met with the PGA Tour's membership before the Travelers Championship, which takes place in Connecticut from Thursday, and world number one Scottie Scheffler said he "liked what I got to hear".

"I think it's exciting to have some new leadership. The first time I heard him speak was yesterday, so I really don't know much about him," said three-time major winner Scheffler. 

"I liked what I heard yesterday. Our board and Jay have put a lot of research into finding his successor and to get someone from high up in the NFL is pretty cool.

"He has a lot of experience and some new thought processes he can bring to the tour. I think it's exciting."

'What's eating Rory?' - will US Open prove reset point for McIlroy?

Northern Ireland's McIlroy will return to the Travelers Championship after skipping the 2024 event to "lick my wounds", having just missed out on winning the US Open at Pinehurst.

McIlroy arrives in Connecticut off the back off a difficult week at this year's major at Oakmont, where he was visibly frustrated by his game as he narrowly made the cut and told reporters he had earned the right "to do what I want" after skipping media sessions.

After the tournament he said he had climbed his "Everest" in completing a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters in April and that he was looking forward to scaling "another mountain".

"The weeks after major championships, sometimes when you're in contention and trying to win them it can feel quite difficult to go and play the next week," the 36-year-old said.

"But after a week like I had at Oakmont, where you aren't quite in the mix but you think you might have found something in your game, you are excited to play again. 

"This is the perfect chaser from last week and it's nice to get out on a golf course where you feel like you can make quite a few birdies." 

When asked if one particular shot at the US Open had made him feel more positive about his game, the five-time major winner said consistency was key and pointed to the fact he made the most shots off the tee in the field at Oakmont.

"If I can see something, or have a feeling, that is very repeatable - on the range is one thing but on the course is another - the proof is in the pudding," he added.

"Last week I felt I found a feeling, especially off the tee that was repeatable and working well. 

"I led strokes off the tee last week which was a big thing for me. I thought I drove the ball well all week."

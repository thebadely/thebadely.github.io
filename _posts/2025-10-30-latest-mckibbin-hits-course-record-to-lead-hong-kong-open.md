It has been recently reported that McKibbin's opening round 60 was lower than his previous best of 62 on the Challenge Tour in 2022

Northern Ireland's Tom McKibbin shot a course record 60 to take the first-round lead at the Hong Kong Open as he attempts to secure a place at next year's Masters and Open Championship.

The 22-year-old made an eagle and eight birdies at the Asian Tour event as he recorded the lowest round of his career.

McKibbin, whose previous best round at a professional event was a 62 on the Challenge Tour in February 2022, broke Englishman Aaron Rai's official course record of 61 at Fanling.

Fellow LIV Golf tour member Patrick Reed shot 59 in the event last year, but that did not count on official records due to preferred lies in place.

"I've shot 62 maybe four times before but this was definitely my lowest and I think it might be very hard to beat," said McKibbin.

He began with a birdie on the second hole, then carded an eagle on the third, before further birdies at the eighth, 10th 12th and 13th.

Belfast-born McKibbin, who made the switch to LIV Golf for the 2025 season, then started a run of three consecutive birdies on the 15th and finished bogey-free at 10 under par to lead Thailand's Jazz Janewattananond - who carded 61 - by a shot.

Fellow NI golfer Graeme McDowell is 87th after a disappointing one-under-par 69.

The winner of the event will qualify for the 2026 Masters, while the highest-placed non-exempt player who makes the cut will earn a place in the field for the 154th Open at Royal Birkdale in July.

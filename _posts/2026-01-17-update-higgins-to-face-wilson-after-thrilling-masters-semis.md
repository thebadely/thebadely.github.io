Here’s what you need to know: Kyren Wilson (right) defeated John Higgins on his way to winning the world title in 2024

John Higgins stunned world number one Judd Trump as he fought back from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win 6-5 and reach his first Masters final since 2021.

The Scot will now face Kyren Wilson in Sunday's best-of-19 showpiece match beginning at 13:00 GMT, after he defeated Chinese debutant Wu Yize 6-5 in another thrilling last-four encounter.

Higgins had lost his previous seven matches against Trump and appeared to be toiling as he made a series of errors in the opening three frames.

However, Trump, whose highest break until that point was just 60, failed to convert two good opportunities to take the fourth frame which provided Higgins with a route back into the contest.

"He should maybe have been 4-0 in front and I maybe made it too easy for him," Higgins, who won the second of his two Masters titles 20 years ago, told BBC Sport.

"The fourth frame was massive because if he goes 4-0 it's done, but at 3-1 I felt good."

"People will laugh but I think I'm a better player now than I've ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him."

With the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.

The Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.

Trump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.

And that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.

Wilson beats Yize in decider to reach Masters final

Both Wilson and Wu had already made their way to Alexandra Palace by the time Higgins and Trump's epic encounter came to a conclusion.

While neither exhibited the sort form that had carried them past Neil Robertson and Xiao Guodong respectively in the quarter-finals, they still delivered a contest brimming with drama for more than 2,000 fans inside Alexandra Palace.

Wu, 22, underlined his status as one of the sport's great new talents when claiming his first ranking title at the International Championship in November.

He also showed he was far from overawed on one of snooker's biggest stages as he took the opener with a run of 75 and constructed another half century to share the first four frames with the 2024 world champion.

When world number two Wilson appeared to be accelerating clear with runs of 76 and 74 to lead 4-2, Wu delivered the perfect riposte knocking in breaks 74, 87 and 58 to move within a frame of his first Triple Crown final.

However, a miss on a routine red to the right corner cost him the 10th frame.

And Wilson, who said he was close to having a "mental breakdown" during his last-32 defeat at the UK Championship, let his emotions out after holding his nerve to produce a sublime match-winning contribution of 116.

"Wu Yize is going to be around for many years to come. I wasn't at the races at all. I don't know where I found those final two frames," Wilson said. 

"It looked like it was going to be all over and I would be out but sometimes the snooker gods are on your side and you have to make the most of it."

Higgins wins decider against Trump to reach Masters final

Higgins, one of snooker's famed 'Class of 92' alongside Mark Williams and Ronnie O'Sullivan, has repeatedly downplayed his chances of winning a first Triple Crown title since 2011.

There have been a number of shattering defeats in the sport's majors since he won his fourth World Championship title, with three coming in successive Crucible finals between 2017-2019. 

He has also not tasted success at the Masters since 2006, losing his only subsequent final at this prestigious invitational tournament in 2021, to Yan Bingtao.

Having briefly dropped out of the top 16 ranking places amid a title drought lasting four years, he has appeared rejuvenated since winning the World Open just over 12 months ago.

And his fiercely competitive match play, which has never been in question, has now allowed him to dispatch the reigning world champion and Trump, in successive matches after staring down the barrel in both.

"Even at 5-3 down I didn't give up. It was the same against Zhao Xintong," Higgins added. 

"Who knows, maybe my name is the the trophy? You just don't know. I've probably been back home watching these finals with so many years going past.  

"Deep down you are maybe thinking, your time has maybe run out to be playing in these massive finals in front of big crowds. I am so proud."

John Higgins is currently fifth on the all-time list of Triple Crown winners with Ronnie O'Sullivan leading the way

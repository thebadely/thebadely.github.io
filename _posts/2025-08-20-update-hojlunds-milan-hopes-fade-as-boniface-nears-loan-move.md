It has been recently reported that Rasmus Hojlund was left out of United's squad for their 1-0 home defeat by Arsenal on Sunday

Bayer Leverkusen striker Victor Boniface is on the brink of completing a loan move to AC Milan that could end Rasmus Hojlund's chances of joining the Serie A giants.

Milan had been keen to sign Hojlund on loan from Manchester United.

However, the Denmark forward, 22, has stalled on a deal because the structure being negotiated did not include an obligation to buy.

Milan have now moved for Boniface with a similar deal, but it is only set to contain an option to turn the move for the Nigerian into a permanent transfer next summer.

Napoli are also on the hunt for a number nine after Romelu Lukaku suffered a thigh injury that could rule him out for up to four months.

Earlier this month, Hojlund declared his intention to remain at United after an inconsistent first couple of seasons. 

Since then, his club has signed Slovenia international Benjamin Sesko in a Â£73.7m deal. 

Hojlund was then left on the bench throughout United's final pre-season match against Fiorentina, then was omitted from Ruben Amorim's squad completely for the Premier League defeat by Arsenal.

Amorim said he had taken the decision because Hojlund "had similar characteristics" to Sesko, who made his debut against the Gunners as a substitute.

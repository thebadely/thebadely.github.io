Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Manchester United won the 2024-25 FA Cup

The FA Cup semi-finals take place this weekend - and you can keep tabs on all of the action via BBC Sport.

The tie between Crystal Palace and Aston Villa on Saturday (17:15 BST) will be shown live on BBC One.

Palace have never won the FA Cup despite reaching the semi-finals for the third time in 10 seasons, while Aston Villa are chasing a first major trophy since 1996.

Nottingham Forest meet seven-time winners Manchester City in the other semi-final on Sunday (16:30 BST). Both fixtures take place at Wembley Stadium.

Two-time winners Forest, who are fourth in the Premier League and chasing a place in next season's Champions League, are looking to reach a fourth FA Cup final - and first since 1991.

You can watch Crystal Palace's game against Aston Villa on BBC one, or by using the BBC iPlayer or BBC Sport website and app.

TV coverage starts at 16:45 BST, with Palace striker Glenn Murray, ex-Aston Villa defender Micah Richards and former England captain Wayne Rooney joining Gary Lineker at Wembley.

Nottingham Forest v Manchester City, meanwhile, will be shown on ITV.

Both semi-finals will be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live.

This year's FA Cup final takes place on Saturday, 17 May at Wembley Stadium, the weekend before the Premier League finishes.

The final will also be broadcast live on the BBC.

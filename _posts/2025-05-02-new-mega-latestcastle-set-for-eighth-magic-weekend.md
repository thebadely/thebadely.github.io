Let's dive into the details: The Magic Weekend has been held at Newcastle United's St James' Park home from 2015-18 and 2021-23

Super League's Magic Weekend makes its return this early May bank holiday weekend as all 12 sides feature in a feast of rugby league on Saturday and Sunday.

The event also returns to Newcastle United's St James' Park after a year's absence when Leeds' Elland Road played host in 2024.

It will be the eighth time the venue has held the event but what is it that keeps the sport coming back?

BBC Sport spoke to those familiar with the Magic Weekend to find out.

St James' Park first held the event in 2015 and ever since it has been a favourite on the calendar for fans and players alike.

Newcastle hosted the Magic Weekend another six times until 2023 - missing out only in 2019 when Liverpool's Anfield played host and 2020 when the event was cancelled because of the Covid pandemic.

Such is the success of the format, Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) adopted it from 2019 under the Magic Round moniker - and have held it at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium ever since.

Coincidentally, the NRL's Magic Round also takes place this weekend.

"If the Aussies are nicking something off us, it's a decent event isn't it?" Wakefield head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds.

"I've always enjoyed it. It's kind of a party atmosphere for the fans which is great.

"St James' Park is really good as a venue, it feels great when you play there. It's great for fans and I think the teams see it as something special."

Powell's comments were echoed by Castleford boss Danny McGuire, who praised the decision to return to a tried and tested venue.

"I'm glad it's back at Newcastle, I think it's a really good venue for it - I think the fans probably take to it more than Leeds last year," he added.

"I went to the Saturday games last year and I don't think there was the same atmosphere."

The event is more than just a return to a well-loved ground for Hull KR forward Sam Luckley - it is literally a homecoming.

The Newcastle-born prop made his Magic Weekend debut at the ground in 2021 with Salford and appeared there again for the Red Devils off the bench the following year.

He featured again at St James' Park for Hull KR in 2023 and would be delighted to make a fourth appearance there and seal another victory for the league leaders.

"It's my childhood dream," he told BBC Sport. "It means so much to me. I've played here a few times now and it just gets better and better.

"I felt a bit lost last year at Leeds but it's nice to come back."

With Newcastle United winning the Carabao Cup recently, there is a sporting buzz about the city. Will that be reflected in the level of support this weekend?

"With the football, everyone's buzzing so I think Newcastle's the best place to be at the minute," Luckley added.

One of the perks of St James' Park is the fact it is centrally located in Newcastle, meaning, unlike some venues used in the past, fans can drift in and out of the stadium and enjoy what the city has to offer.

"It's probably my favourite - all the family come down for it, it's just a mega occasion," Warrington centre Toby King told BBC Sport.

"The city has a proper vibrant party lifestyle in it and there's a lot of places to enjoy yourself in Newcastle."

It is almost 20 years since the first Magic Weekend event was held in 2007 at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and it has been a staple on the Super League calendar ever since.

But now the event has settled on Newcastle as its most logical and loved home, can that inspire the game to break out of its heartlands?

Wigan hooker Kruise Leeming thinks so.

"I'm all for anything that is filling stadiums and getting a load of fans together," Leeming told BBC Sport.

"Our sport is so unique in that aspect that you can have all different sets of fans together with no trouble. It's a family event.

"We've seen what happened in Vegas [with March's rugby league festival which included a Super League game between Wigan and Warrington] and how much of a success that was.

"To have it [Magic Weekend] in Newcastle, it's a great venue and a great hotbed for rugby league.

"The more teams we can have in different areas of England the better. To have a team in Newcastle filling out this stadium every week, it would be a dream."

So, what does the event mean to someone relatively new to Magic Weekend?

Hull FC forward Herman Ese'ese believes a stadium with the stature of St James' Park is befitting the event.

"I'm a big fan, I got my first taste last year in Leeds - it's great for the fans and the game and I'm really excited about it," he told BBC Sport.

"My first thought was how big the stadium is compared to some we play at during the season. 

"It's exciting for all the teams to come here and spend some time together and play at a nice stadium."

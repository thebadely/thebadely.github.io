According to new developments, Wigan's Grace Banks celebrates with supporters after the Warriors secured the League Leaders' Shield

Wigan Warriors ended St Helens' unbeaten record to win the League Leaders' Shield in Women's Super League.

The Warriors went into the derby game knowing that a win would secure the regular season crown because of the withdrawal of Warrington from the competition, and the subsequent 48-0 victory awarded to them for next weekend's final-round fixture against the Wolves.

Wigan sat a point behind Saints prior to kick-off, and they had to come from behind at half-time in a nip-and-tuck affair to claim victory.

The visitors struck first at the Totally Wicked Stadium as Jenna Foubister went over and Isabel Rowe converted, but Saints soon levelled as forward Channy Crowl powered on to Katie Mottershead's slick pass, and Faye Gaskin added the extras.

Dani McGifford edged Saints back in front with an unconverted try, but Wigan winger Anna Davies levelled it up again.

Rachael Woosey's try from a sharp Luci McColm pass restored the Saints lead, with Gaskin kicking, but Georgia Wilson scored in the corner to reduce the home team's lead to 16-14 at half-time.

Inside the first ten minutes of a tight and tense second half, Grace Banks went over for a try, and Rowe converted to give Wigan the lead for the first time since their early score. However, Phoebe Hook equalised again with another fine try, but Gaskin was unable to add the extras.

Molly Jones scored the decisive try with nine minutes left and Wigan held out in a frantic finish.

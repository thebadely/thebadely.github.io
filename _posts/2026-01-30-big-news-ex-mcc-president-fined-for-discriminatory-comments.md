Let's dive into the details: Phillip Hodson also played first-class cricket for Cambridge University

Former Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) president Phillip Hodson has been fined for offensive and discriminatory comments he made at an after-dinner speech when he was deputy chair at Yorkshire.

Hodson, a Yorkshire businessman and former Cambridge cricketer, was introducing a guest speaker at Scarborough Cricket Club in July last year when he made two comments related to sexual orientation and people living with a disability.

The independent Cricket Discipline Panel imposed a reprimand, a Â£1,000 fine and a requirement to go on a training course that addresses equality and diversity on Hodson, who is no longer in his position at Yorkshire.

Chris Haward, managing director of the Cricket Regulator, said: "The ICEC report was clear that as with all areas of culture, the tone is set from the top down, and the Cricket Regulator will act irrespective of the individual's position within the game."

Hodson, 74, was MCC president in 2012 and was the first Yorkshireman to hold the position in 50 years.

In 2023, Yorkshire were fined Â£400,000 and given points deductions for their handling of the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal.

Former Yorkshire player Rafiq said English cricket was "institutionally racist", and racist language was used "constantly" at the club.

Six ex-Yorkshire players found to have used racist language at the club were sanctioned with fines and bans.

Earlier this week, former England all-rounder Moeen Ali cancelled retirement plans to join the club and lauded their steps to stamp out racism.

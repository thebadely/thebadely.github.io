It has been recently reported that With the headline "I won't cave in to militant doctors", the Daily Mail says the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has criticised what he calls the "unreasonable" demands of resident doctors, as they begin a five-day strike in England.  

Writing in the Times, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says the walkouts will put patients at risk and "play into the hands" of those who want the NHS to fail, in what the paper calls his strongest intervention yet on industrial action. The Conservatives have told the Daily Express that Labour appeased unions last year by offering inflation-busting pay deals, arguing this "capitulation" has emboldended further strikes at a time when patients can least afford it.

An image of Palestinians desperately begging for food dominates the front page of the Daily Mirror, which says the UK government has been urged to do more to end the suffering in Gaza by MPs on the foreign affairs committee. The Guardian features a similar image alongside the latest warning about starvation in the territory, made by the UN. The Times highlights the recognition of a Palestinian state by France and says pressure is growing on Sir Keir to do the same.

An investigation by the Sun has uncovered what the paper says is evidence of gangs of asylum seekers stealing luxury items worth thousands of pounds from shops in London's West End. It says it was alerted to the thefts by whistleblowers from security firms who feel powerless to act against the shoplifters, who are alleged to be staying in hotels at the taxpayers' expense. The Sun's leader column says the policy of putting migrants in hotel, and the inability to stop shoplifting, are both "abject failures" that "paint a depressing picture of a Britain that's lost the plot".

The Daily Telegraph is alarmed by official figures which suggest a record number of agricultural, forestry and fishing businesses closed over the past year. It says opposition parties have blamed the rise on the chancellor's decision to cut inheritance tax relief for some family farms. The government says farming profits in the UK increased by Â£1.6bn last year.

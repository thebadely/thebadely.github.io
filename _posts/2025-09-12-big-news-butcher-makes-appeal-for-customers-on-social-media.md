It has been recently reported that A shop that has housed butchery businesses for more than 100 years could face the chop unless more people use it.

Jones Butchers has stood on Broad Street in Whittlesey, near Peterborough, since 1957 and before it, two other butchers dating back to the early 1900s have been there.

Mark Field, a butcher with 30 years' experience, took over the business in June but has appealed for more customers on social media, putting his struggles down to the cost of living and the convenience of supermarkets.

Trade association National Craft Butchers (NCB) said beef prices were at an historic high, with the cost of meat generally rising 17%, which had made it tough for independent butchers.

After always working for other people in the butchery industry, Mr Field, 47, thought he would try and go it alone and run his own shop after an opportunity arose.

"I am not regretting taking it on because I have a love for the job and I've always wanted to do this," he said.

But despite a summer perfect for barbecues, Mr Field said he had already been forced to cut down on staffing hours and upped his own shift patterns, working 60 hours a week.

"Things have picked up a bit since I made the plea for more customers on Facebook last week, so I will keep my fingers crossed", he said.

But he added: "The cost of meat has been rising across the board, and I think younger people can sometimes feel intimidated by coming in to a shop where they have to ask for something. They prefer picking up meat in packs from a supermarket."

Adrian Cornwell, who runs Bent and Cornwell in Ely, noticed that business had also been quieter this year. 

"We can't compete with supermarkets on prices, but what we can do is share our vast knowledge with our customers on how best to prepare various cuts of meat," he said.

Mr Cornwell added that he had tried to replicate how the supermarkets displayed their meat, because "that's what the shopper expects". 

He agreed with Mr Field that the younger generation seemed to forgo visiting butchers' shops, preferring the convenience of the supermarket.

Beef prices have increased to historic highs of Â£7 per kg due to constrained supply and continued consumer demand, said NCB.

According to the British Retail Consortium, food prices rose by 4% in July from a year earlier.

Meat prices have also increased by 17% up to June this year.

John Mettrick, legislation director at NCB and a fifth generation butcher, said it was "tough for all businesses on the High Street, not just butchers".

He said his own shop had managed to entice younger customers by selling "kitchen-ready" meals.

"I do a thing called 'fake-a-ways', stir fries, Indian dishes, all prepared ready for the oven, it saves so much time," he said.

Experts revealed that Ospreys had agreed to finalise a long-term lease at make St Helen's their new home

Swansea's local authority is considering legal action amid growing doubts over the future of the Ospreys while players say they have been "kept in the dark" over the region's fate.

Uncertainty has arisen after Ospreys owners â Y11 Sports & Media â emerged as the preferred bidders in a deal to buy rivals Cardiff from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).

It has sparked concern among supporters who fear it could mean the end of the region as the WRU prepares to reduce the number of professional sides from four to three.

There has been no comment from the Ospreys, Y11, or the WRU on the matter, nor from Wales head coach Steve Tandy as he named seven Ospreys players in his squad for the upcoming Six Nations.

A number of Ospreys players, including Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake and internationals Sam Parry, Dan Edwards and Gareth Thomas, have shared a statement on social media which says: "We have been left in the dark by the WRU and Y11.

"We ourselves have had no information regarding the ongoing situation. We struggle to believe the most successful Welsh team to exist with the biggest history is on the brink of non-existence."

Local Labour MP Torsten Bell also criticised the WRU on social media adding he was "urgently writing to Y11 to call for a meeting to clarify their intentions".

And the leader of Swansea council said that they would explore "all options â including legal action â to safeguard the future of regional rugby in Swansea."

Plans for the development of the St Helen's ground in Swansea â earmarked as the new home of the Ospreys â have also been questioned as a result of recent developments, with the local council set to invest more than Â£4m in the project.

Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea Council, said: "We remain 100% committed to supporting the Ospreys returning to St Helen's as Swansea's regional rugby base.

"As the second largest city in Wales with the most successful rugby region and an extensive and long-established grassroots rugby base, it is vital that we retain regional rugby in Swansea.

"We are seeking clarification from Y11, the owners of the Ospreys, about their involvement in any bid process and their intentions for the Ospreys.

"The WRU's ongoing lack of clarity and failure to provide meaningful detail is unacceptable. Their approach has unsettled and alienated rugby supporters across Wales.

"Without transparency, no one can judge whether the WRU's proposals are in the best interests of Welsh rugby. This uncertainty is damaging the game, and we are already seeing more regional players leave Wales because they cannot rely on a stable future here.

"In light of this, the council is considering all our options, including legal action, to safeguard the future of regional rugby in Swansea."

The council stated it would still commit to a new sports park in the city, incorporating the Wales National Pool, rugby and cricket and were "unaffected by the WRU's plans for regional rugby".

Fan group, Ospreys Supporters Club, called on owners Y11 to "address these concerns directly and without delay" adding that "the least our supporters deserve is a full explanation".

BBC Sport Wales have approached the WRU, Y11 and Ospreys for comment.

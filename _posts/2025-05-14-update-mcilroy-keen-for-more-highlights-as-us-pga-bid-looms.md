It has been recently reported that McIlroy has won four PGA Tour events at Quail Hollow, the host of this week's US PGA Championship

Date: 15-18 May Venue: Quail Hollow, North Carolina

Coverage: Thursday, 15 May - live text from 13:00 BST on BBC Sport website and app. Live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra from 13:00-19:00.

Rory McIlroy says he wants to "create a few more highlights" after completing the career Grand Slam - but admits he may never beat the feeling he had when he won the Masters. 

The Northern Irishman returns to major action at this week's US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, where he has won four PGA Tour events. 

The 36-year-old hopes to become the first player to win back-to-back majors since Jordan Spieth claimed the Masters and US Open in 2015.

While McIlroy described the outpouring of congratulatory messages following his Masters win as "absolutely amazing", he suggested he is far from finished. 

"Everyone needs to have goals and dreams and I've been able to do something that I dreamed of for a long time," said the world number two.

"I'm still going to set myself goals, I'm still going to try to achieve certain things but I sit here knowing that very well could be the highlight of my career.

"That's a very cool thing. I still want to create a lot of other highlights and high points but I'm not sure if any other win will live up to what happened a few weeks ago."

Why McIlroy is favourite to win US PGA at Quail Hollow

Will in-form Spieth join Grand Slam club at US PGA?

When asked if he still has a 'North Star' achievement following his emotional Masters win, McIlroy added: "Not necessarily. I think everyone saw how hard having a North Star is and being able to get over the line.

"If I can try to get the best out of myself every week, I know what my abilities are, I know the golf that I can play and if I keep doing that every week, especially in these four big ones each year, I know I'll have my chances."

Having won all four majors, McIlroy's next significant achievement could be to match Sir Nick Faldo's European record of six major titles. 

"I've always said I'm not going to put a number on it," added McIlroy, who will play alongside world number one Scottie Scheffler and defending champion Xander Schauffele during the first two rounds of the US PGA. 

"I've talked about becoming the best European ever or the best international player, whatever that is, but the numbers tell one thing and it might not be the full story. 

"I feel like I burdened myself with the career Grand Slam stuff and I want to enjoy this. I want to enjoy what I've achieved and enjoy the last decade or whatever of my career.

"I don't want to burden myself with numbers or statistics. I just want to play the best golf I can."

McIlroy explained his decision to keep conversation to a minimum with Bryson DeChambeau during the Masters final round

McIlroy played alongside Bryson DeChambeau in the final round of the Masters, pitting the rivals against each other again after the American's dramatic US Open win in 2024.

After carding a disappointing final-round 75 to finish tied fifth, DeChambeau said McIlroy "didn't talk to me once all day". 

"I don't know what he was expecting," said McIlroy when asked about DeChambeau's comments.

"Like, we're trying to win the Masters. I'm not going to be his best mate out there.

"Everyone approaches the game in different ways. I was focused on myself and what I needed to do and that's really all that it was.

"It wasn't anything against him, that's just what I felt I needed to do to try and get the best out of myself on that day."

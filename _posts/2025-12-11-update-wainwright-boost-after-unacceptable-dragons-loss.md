According to new developments, Dragons forward Aaron Wainwright has won 62 caps for Wales

European Challenge Cup: Dragons v Lyon

Venue: Rodney Parade, Newport Date: Sunday, 14 December Kick-off: 15:15 GMT

Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Sport website and app.

Wales number eight Aaron Wainwright will boost Dragons' bid to bounce back from an "unacceptable" opening European Challenge Cup defeat when hosting Lyon on Sunday.

The Rodney Parade club are still without a win in 2025 and last weekend were thrashed 41-17 by Perpignan, who have lost all 11 games in the Top 14 this season.

Dragons drew two home games in the first block of the United Rugby Championship (URC), but now hunt a first success since winning at Newcastle in the Challenge Cup last December.

Wainwright was rested for the trip to Perpignan after his autumn exertions with Wales and will return for Dragons on Sunday.

"We are excited to have 'Waino' back in. He's a good strong Gwent man and is important to the group, and important to the nation," said head coach Filo Tiatia.

Dragons have played 19 fixtures in 2025 and lost 17 of them, with chances blown for late home victories in draws against Sharks and Ospreys in the first block of the URC.

Tiatia has enjoyed just one victory since taking over from Dai Flanagan after the first block of 2024-25 and the pressure is mounting.

The head coach insisted an "honest review" had been held into the error-strewn display at a previously winless Perpignan, who need a miracle to avoid Top 14 relegation.

"The result wasn't great and our performance wasn't great," said Tiatia. "As a group we know that it was unacceptable around some of the things we said we were going to do, but didn't do.

"This is another exciting opportunity and we can't have a day off when we perform in this jersey. Lyon is an opportunity to put some wrongs right."

Dragons have a six-day turnaround from the Lyon fixture to a home URC game against Connacht that is followed by festive derbies at Cardiff and Scarlets at Rodney Parade.

"We are in the third week of a 10-week block and it's an opportunity for us to make a turn," said Tiatia.

"I am pretty positive around our preparation. It's time to put a line in the sand, they have been sharp this week and we are looking forward to the game."

Dragons' issues at hooker worsened last weekend when Sam Scarfe, who was making his first professional start, went off with a head injury.

He is still going through return-to-play protocols while Elliot Dee and James Benjamin are out until the New Year and Oli Burrows and Brodie Coghlan are doubts for this weekend.

That leaves on-loan Will Austin, a former Wales Under-20s international who has made two appearances off the bench after signing a short-term deal from Sale Sharks, as the only definite option and Dragons hope to make another emergency signing.

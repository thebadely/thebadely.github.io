According to new developments, Nuno Espirito Santo guided Nottingham Forest to European qualification for the first time since 1995-96

Nottingham Forest will face Malmo in the league phase of the Europa League in their first European campaign in 30 years.

The match is a rerun of the 1979 European Cup final, when Forest striker Trevor Francis scored the winner in a 1-0 victory for Brian Clough's side.

Forest will also play Porto and Real Betis, while Aston Villa have been drawn against Feyenoord, Fenerbahce and Bologna.

Celtic and Rangers will both take on Roma, with the Scottish sides having missed out on Champions League qualification this week.

The 36-team league phase was introduced last season. In the Europa League each side plays eight teams - four home and four away - while in the Conference League teams play six opponents, three home and three away.

Teams from the same league cannot play each other until the knockout stages.

Forest finished seventh in the Premier League last season to qualify for the Conference League, but were promoted to the Europa League at Crystal Palace's expense after the Eagles breached multi-club ownership rules.

Palace, who qualified for Europe by winning the FA Cup - the first trophy in the club's history - have been drawn against Dynamo Kyiv, Shelbourne and Strasbourg in the Conference League.

Aberdeen will play Shakhtar Donetsk, Strasbourg and AEK Athens in the Conference League.

The first Europa League matches will be played on 24 September with the Conference League starting on 2 October. 

Exact scheduling for the fixtures will follow in the coming days.

This season's Europa League final will be held at Istanbul's Besiktas Park with the Conference League showpiece taking place at the RB Arena in Leipzig.

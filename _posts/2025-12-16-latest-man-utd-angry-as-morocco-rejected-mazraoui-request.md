Experts revealed that Noussair Mazraoui had started Manchester United's past two matches before the Bournemouth game

Manchester United are angry with the Moroccan Football Association for rejecting their plea for Noussair Mazraoui to play in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth - six days before the country's opener at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon).

United head coach Ruben Amorim said on Friday negotiations with the relevant national bodies were continuing over the release of Mazraoui, Cameroon's Bryan Mbeumo and Ivory Coast's Amad Diallo to Afcon.

Fifa announced on 3 December that clubs only need to release players from 15 December, instead of 14 days before the tournament that runs from from 21 December to 18 January.

While Mbeumo and Amad were allowed to stay for Monday's match, Morocco - who host the tournament and play Comoros on 21 December - took a different view.

United had anticipated all three players would be available, given the rest of the Premier League matches were played before the revised release date announced by Fifa - which it said could be negotiated with the relevant countries.

Mazraoui trained with United all week thinking he would be involved.

BBC Sport understands United escalated the matter to world football's governing body, who did not force Morocco to back down.

This has led to considerable frustration at Old Trafford, with insiders saying United believe they have been unfairly treated.

While they felt Cameroon and Ivory Coast were sympathetic and collaborative in their discussions, the club feel Morocco prioritised a national team training session over an important league game.

Italian side Roma and La Liga outfit Real Betis experienced similar frustration in their dealings with Morocco.

Fifa had urged federations and clubs to "hold bilateral discussions in good faith to find appropriate individual solutions".

It added: "In cases where there continues to be a dispute over the release of players subsequent to such bilateral discussions, Fifa will, in mediating between both parties, apply guidelines that take into account the circumstances of each case, including factors related to the timing of matches of affected competitions, the stage of these competitions, the historical and planned involvement of the players in the matches in question, as well as any other pertinent factors."

Mbeumo and Amad have now joined up with their national squads and will miss Sunday's Premier League trip to Aston Villa.

In Mazraoui's absence, and with Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt both ruled out through injury, Amorim included 19-year-old Ayden Heaven and 20-year-old centre-back Leny Yoro - who joined for Â£52.18m - in his defence against the Cherries as United missed the chance to climb into fifth spot in the table.

BBC Sport has contacted Morocco and Fifa for comment.

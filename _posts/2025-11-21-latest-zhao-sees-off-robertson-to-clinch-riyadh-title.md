Let's dive into the details: Zhao Xintong collected his first trophy since winning at the Crucible Theatre in May

World champion Zhao Xintong claimed a 5-2 victory over Neil Robertson to clinch  the Riyadh Season Snooker Championship. 

Zhao becomes the 11th different winner from 11 events on the professional circuit this season and collects Â£250,000 for his success in Saudi Arabia.

While the opening two frames were shared, Zhao then compiled superb breaks of 131 and 134 as he reeled off the next three to open a 4-1 lead. 

And even though Robertson crafted a 91 to reduce his arrears, the 28-year-old from China sealed his win with a half-century in the seventh frame.

"I didn't want Neil to know I was nervous. I was looking forward to this final a lot because Neil is a very good player and someone I wanted to play. I am so happy now," Zhao said.

"It's been amazing this week. It's my first time in Saudi and I could see a lot of people were here for me."  

It proved to be a comfortable conclusion to Friday for Zhao, who had earlier edged to a dramatic 4-3 win over world number one Judd Trump in the semi-finals. 

In a see-saw contest Trump led 2-0 and 3-2 but Zhao, who registered the highest break of the week with a 138 against the Englishman, showed his resolve.

Meanwhile, Robertson, who has looked rejuvenated over the past 18 months, had been aiming to become the only player this season to win multiple titles after defeating Mark Allen 4-1.

"A few tired misses I suppose were quite costly [against Zhao]. I was well below the level I had shown in getting to the final and he punished me really well," Robertson said.

The Australian progressed past Allen following a wonderful 73 clearance in the fifth frame.

That was after the Northern Irishman had knocked in nine reds with blacks but broke down on 72 as he attempted to make a 147 - he could have then potted the unique 20-point golden ball for a 167 break and $1m (Â£763,000) bonus.

Let's dive into the details: Jared Waerea-Hargreaves confirmed in April that this would be his final season before retiring

Hull KR prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is eligible to play in Saturday's Super League Grand Final against Wigan Warriors after the club successfully appealed against his three-match ban. 

The 36-year-old had been charged with a Grade C head contact offence in Saturday's semi-final win over St Helens.

The former New Zealand international is set to retire after the Grand Final, meaning that had he received a ban, the semi-final would have been his last game.

Waerea-Hargreaves joined the Robins on a one-year deal for the 2025 season after 14 years with Sydney Roosters.

He made 18 Super League appearances and helped the club to the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield.

It has been recently reported that Amrit Paul was in the middle of his computer science exams when he was told by doctors he would need a kidney transplant.

"It was a shock. I didn't really know how to handle it and, in all honesty, I went into a shell," he said.

He was placed on the organ donation register almost five years ago, having been diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease aged four.

Amrit undergoes nine hours of peritoneal dialysis each night, a method of blood purification used when kidneys fail. 

"People say I look fine, but under the hood there are a lot of problems," the 24-year-old said.

Now he and his parents are appealing for a living kidney donor from the South Asian community to come forward.

"Feeling your body change as your organs start to decline is tough," added Amrit, who works remotely in software sales.

"My family are my motivation, they've been so supportive."

Amrit's mum Jatinder Paul is leading their campaign. Their poster reads: "Please, help us find an angel for Amrit."

Their appeal comes as NHS Blood and Transplant reveals that a record number of people are waiting for a life-saving transplant in the UK.

When Amrit's immediate family, who are Indian Punjabi, discovered they were unable to donate, they also became aware of the shortage of matching donors from global majority backgrounds.

"As a parent, it's hard not being able to donate because of your own health issues," said Jatinder.

"So you reach out to the wider community and ask if there's someone who can help give him his life back."

Dr Rhys Evans, clinical lead for kidney transplantation at Royal Free London, where Amrit is receiving care, said ethnicity can play a significant role in how long a patient waits.

"Unfortunately, for patients like Amrit who has blood group B, which is more common in South Asian and Black ethnic groups it often means a longer wait, because there are fewer donors from those communities," he said.

As of 31 March 2025, more than 8,000 people were on the active transplant waiting list across the UK - the highest number ever recorded. Over 1,300 of those patients are based in London.

In the capital, the number of deceased organ donors fell last year to 130, down from 154 the previous year.

Fiona Loud, policy director at charity Kidney Care UK, said greater awareness and conversation within ethnic minority communities is vital.

"Sadly, every day at least one person dies waiting for a transplant. This has to change," she said.

"People from Black and South Asian communities are more likely to need a donor from the same background as them so that the organ is less likely to be rejected. 

"Talking about it and sharing your decision helps debunk myths and makes your wishes clear to loved ones."

Anthony Clarkson, director of organ and tissue donation and transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant, is also urging people to register their wishes.

"We are facing an incredibly concerning situation. More people than ever are waiting for transplants, but fewer donations are taking place," he said.

"We need to act across all areas - modernising the Organ Donor Register, improving understanding of the law, and investing in technologies that preserve and treat organs."

Despite the difficulties and uncertainty about whether a donor will come forward, the family say they remain hopeful.

"We want to spread the word, bring awareness and find a match," said Jatinder. 

"He's focused on living a normal life, and that's what gives us the strength to keep going as a unit."

Let's dive into the details:  

The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina. 

Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.

The action actually starts a couple of days before the opening ceremony. Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.

All times GMT.

All you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics

How does curling work?

Medals: Five

Medal events: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50); Women's cross country - skiathlon (12:00-13:50); Women's speed skating 3000m (15:00-1650); Women's ski jumping - normal hill (17:45-20:00); Men's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05).

Freestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)

Kirsty Muir has had her struggles since reaching the Olympic final four years ago â including recovering from a torn ACL â but the 21-year-old Scot comes to Italy on the back of winning X Games gold in January and her first World Cup gold last year. 

Defending Olympic champion Mathilde Gremaud and China's US-born superstar Eileen Gu are both competing but Italian teenager Flora Tabanelli, the current Youth Olympic champion, has not made the start list after suffering a serious knee injury in November.

Alpine skiing: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50)

The first medals of these Olympics could quite feasibly all go the way of Switzerland. 

Back-to-back World Cup champion Marco Odermatt will start as slight favourite ahead of compatriot and 2025 world champion Franjo von Allmen. 

Another Swiss star, Alexis Monney, will head to the Games as Stelvio's most recent World Cup downhill winner â could he, ahem, cash in on gold ahead of his team-mates?

Austria's Vincent Kriechmayr will have something to say about that, while Giovanni Franzoni, who won the recent Kitzbuhel downhill and veteran Dominik Paris, 36, will carry the weight of expectation for the host nation.

Snowboard: Men's big air (18:30-19:50)

Twelve of the world's top snowboarders will be showing off their tricks in one of the most spectacular sports on the Winter Olympic programme. 

It looks like an open competition but Japan's team is full of talent, including reigning world champion Ryoma Kimata and overall World Cup winner Taiga Hasegawa.

Mixed doubles curling round robin matches continue. 

There's no rest for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, who are in action twice today for the third day running. At 09:05 they face Canada's husband-and-wife pair Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman. 

Then at 13:35 they're up against 2023 world champions Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse of the USA, who are making their Olympic debut.

Men's freeski slopestyle qualifying starts at 13:00, with defending Olympic champion and 2024â25 World Cup winner Alex Hall of the USA looking like the man to beat.

How Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear

Vonn, Gu and Malinin - global stars to follow at Milan-Cortina 2026

Medals: Eight

Medal events: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50); Men's cross-country 10km skiathlon (11:30-13:00); Men's and women's snowboard parallel giant slalom (12:00-13:40); Biathlon â mixed relay  (13:05-14:40); Men's speed skating 5000m (15:00-17:20); Men's luge (16:00-19:40); Team figure skating (18:30-22:05).

Snowboard: Parallel giant slalom (08:00-14:00)

Czech superstar Ester Ledecka takes aim at an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic gold in the women's parallel giant slalom. 

Ledecka made history in 2018 by becoming the first woman to win gold medals in two different sports by also winning the alpine skiing Super-G, and she could repeat the feat at these Games. 

Meanwhile, Austria's Claudia Riegler is set to become the oldest woman to compete at the Winter Olympics at the age of 52. 

Hosts Italy have several big hopes in the men's event, including reigning world champion Roland Fischnaller, who will be competing in his seventh Winter Olympics at the age of 45.

Vonn made her Olympic debut aged 17 in Salt Lake City in 2002

Alpine skiing: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50)

This race marks the return of legendary American skier Lindsey Vonn, six years after her retirement from the sport. 

Downhill is the 41-year-old's speciality and she's won a record 45 World Cup races in this event, plus her only Olympic gold medal in 2010.

We will have to see how much of an affect crashing in the final World Cup downhill before the Winter Olympics hinders Vonn's bid.  

Keep an eye out for her superbly-named compatriot Breezy Johnson, who is the 2025 world champion. 

The host nation will be hopeful of at least one podium place, although World Cup champion Federica Brignone only returned to action in January, nine months after breaking multiple bones in her left leg and tearing her ACL during a giant slalom crash at the Italian Championships. 

Bergamo native Sofia Goggia took downhill silver four years ago despite suffering a knee injury just 23 days before the event.

Cross country skiing: Men's skiathlon (11:30-12:50)

It's a fifth Winter Olympics for Britain's Andrew Musgrave, whose best Olympic result is seventh in the skiathlon in 2018. 

In this event, competitors complete 10km using the classical technique before changing skis and doing 10km using the freestyle technique. 

Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the world champion and this could be the first of a bobble-hatful of golds for the Norwegian at these Games.

Snowboard: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)

Britain's Mia Brookes has every chance of becoming Britain's youngest Winter Olympic medallist for 78 years. 

The rider from Cheshire has just turned 19 but has already won back-to-back big air World Cup titles and comes to Italy fresh from winning medals in the X Games. 

But she will face a stacked field, including Japan's Kokomo Murase, Reira Iwabuchi and Mari Fukada, who formed a clean sweep of the medals at last year's World Championships. 

Austria's Anna Gasser is aiming to win the event for the third Games in a row at the age of 34. 

Maisie Hill, whose career was almost ended by a horrific training accident three years ago, will be Britain's other representative.

Figure skating: Team (20:55)

The team figure skating competition concludes with the men's free skate. 

The USA won gold after the Russian team was demoted in Beijing in a protracted saga that delayed the medal ceremony by over two years. 

The USA are the reigning World Team Trophy champions and won three of the four individual events at last year's World Championships but Japan and Georgia will be pushing them hard.

Mixed doubles curling continues with another double-header for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in their final matches of the round robin stage. 

First up at 13:35 is Switzerland's husband-and-wife duo of Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-HÃ¼rlimann. 

Then at 18:05 there will be a big clash with home favourites and reigning Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini. It's a repeat of last year's World Championships final, which the Italians won.

Medals: Five

Medal events: Women's freestyle ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Men's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20); Women's speed skating 1000m (16:30-18:20); Women's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05); Men's ski jumping - normal hill (18:00-20:15).

Freestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)

Newly-crowned X Games champion Kirsty Muir, Team GB's youngest competitor at the last Winter Olympics, will be hoping to have reached the final for a second consecutive Games. 

The 21-year-old Scot returned from a torn ACL to win her first World Cup gold last year but would face high-class competition with the likes of reigning Olympic and world champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's superstar Eileen Gu and Italy's emerging 18-year-old talent Flora Tabanelli.

Figure skating: Ice dance â rhythm dance (18:20-2200)

Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson begin their campaign to win Britain's first figure skating medal since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean earned bronze in Lillehammer in 1994. 

The omens are good for the British pair â last year, they won GB's first figure skating World Championship medal in more than 40 years with bronze in Boston. 

Favourites are likely to be the USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have won the last three world titles. However, they will face a big challenge from new French pairing Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry. 

Britain will also be represented by Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez.

Snowboard: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)

British teenager Mia Brookes will be hoping to land a big trick â and an Olympic medal â in this event, which involves breathtaking acrobatics and mind-boggling bravery as competitors launch themselves into the air from a huge ramp. 

Anna Gasser has won both previous Olympic big air titles and the 34-year-old Austrian is back for a crack at a hat-trick. Japan's quartet of talented riders will also be in the mix.

The curling mixed doubles semi-finals take place at 17:05 â Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, and will be hoping to be in a position to make amends today.

Alpine skiing slides into new territory with the debut of the men's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) and a Swiss clean sweep is not out of the question â their first, second and fourth-choice pairings took gold, silver and bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Austria.

Medals: Nine

Medal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10).

Freestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)

The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. 

Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud â who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022.

Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhood

Alpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) 

The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. 

Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here.

Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20)

The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  â Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. 

The pair were world champions in 2021 and runners-up last year but it's a tough field that includes reigning world and Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini, who are competing in front of their home crowd in Italy.

Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10)

The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. 

Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings.

Most athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. 

She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. 

We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) â another Olympic medal would be her 12th.

Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion.

The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) â and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles. 

Natalie Geisenberger, the winner of the last three and one of the most successful female Winter Olympians in history, has retired, paving the way for one of her compatriots, headed by reigning world champion Julia Taubitz.

Medals: Seven

Medal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15).

Alpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50)

Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by â the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. 

Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.

Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  

The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. 

The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. 

Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.

Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)

Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. 

The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. 

In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.

Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)

Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.

Figure skating: Ice dance â free dance (18:30-22:05)

Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. 

Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. 

Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.

USA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30. 

This will be the first Olympic men's snowboard halfpipe competition (18:30) since 2002 that hasn't featured USA superstar Shaun White. The top 12 qualifiers in the men's and women's events advance to the final.

Can anyone stop the Dutch in the men's 1000m speed skating (17:30)? They have won gold in this event at each of the past three Games, with the now-retired Thomas Krol taking the title in 2022.

Defending champion Jakara Anthony bids to become the first Australian to win two Winter Olympic gold medals in the women's moguls final (13:15).

Medals: Nine

Medal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20).

Skeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00)

Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. 

Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. 

Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress since

Two-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. 

The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day.

Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30)

This event promises to be one of the most entertaining â and open â of the entire Games. 

Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 

2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany.

Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. 

She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. 

Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.

Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)

American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. 

The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. 

She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's "good to go" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.

Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)

It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. 

Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. 

That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.

Women's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05. 

In men's curling, Britain face a rematch of the 2022 Olympic final â which they lost â against Niklas Edin's Sweden rink (13:05).

Buoyed by the availability of NHL players for the first time since 2014, Canada and the USA play their opening group games in the men's ice hockey. 

Nine-time gold medallists Canada take on the Czech Republic at 15:40 while the USA â who haven't lifted the title since 1980 â face Latvia at 20:10.

The luge team relay (17:30) is always an entertaining watch and has been extended to four legs at these Games, with the addition of women's doubles. 

Germany have won gold all three previous times it has been held and will be favourites once again.

The fast-paced and exciting snowboard cross begins with the men's competition today (09:00). Huw Nightingale goes for Britain.

Medals: Seven

Medal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).

Snowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)

Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. 

Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. 

She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.

Figure skating: Men â free skate (18:00-22:10)

We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. 

If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.

Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)

Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? 

The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season. 

The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.

Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) 

American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. 

Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 â is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?

Women's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. 

The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. 

The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.

Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.

Medals: Eight

Medal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).

Alpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)

Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage â back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. 

The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian â Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 â so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?

Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) 

Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. 

The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.

Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)

It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. 

Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?

Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a year

Freestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)

Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. 

Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. 

The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.

The two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).

Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05.

Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm.

Medals: Nine

Medal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05).

Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)   

After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. 

She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.

Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)

Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? 

The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. 

His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.

Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)

This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. 

Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.

Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)

The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. 

The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.

Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)

A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. 

Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.

The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.

The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). 

Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.

It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling â they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. 

At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. 

The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.

Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. 

Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). 

Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.

Medals: Six

Medal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).

Alpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)

Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. 

Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.

Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 months

Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)

Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. 

Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. 

Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.

Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)

The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. 

Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold â and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. 

A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.

Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)

Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. 

But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. 

And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 â the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.

Women's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. 

Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.

It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling â Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. 

In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.

The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. 

The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. 

Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.

Medals: Seven

Medal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).

Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)

British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. 

The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. 

The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.

Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)

Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? 

The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. 

The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.

Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)

New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. 

But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.

Women's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). 

It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. 

Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.

Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. 

Medals: Eight

Medal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).

Alpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)

"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics," said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. "For the past few years, it has been a little bit." 

The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. 

Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014

"It's not so much about unfinished business," continued the American. "It's more about making peace." 

Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.

Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) 

The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.

It's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.

In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.

There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?

Medals: Seven

Medal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).

Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)

Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics â ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. 

Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. 

Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. 

France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.

Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)

The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. 

The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle â reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. 

But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian â who will be competing as a neutral athlete â emerge as a contender?

Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) 

Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. 

The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. 

The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.

Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)

Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. 

The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. 

However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.

It's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and â in the case of the men's competition â played on the same day. 

Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).

Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17

Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). 

Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. 

A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.

The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. 

US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.

Medals: Six

Medal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).

Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) 

The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. 

She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned â she received her medal more than a year later. 

Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.

Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)

The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. 

Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.

Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)

Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled â and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. 

Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.

It's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. 

However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. 

It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).

Medals: 10

Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).

Freestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)

Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. 

His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.

Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)

Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. 

Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. 

The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.

Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022

Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)

Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. 

The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. 

The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.

Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)

Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? 

The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.

As well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). 

Germany â particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich â have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.

The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). 

The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.

Medals: Four

Medal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)

Bobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)

History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. 

The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. 

His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.

Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in Beijing

Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)

This event proved the highlight â and saving grace â of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. 

With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.

Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)

Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner â so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? 

Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. 

That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.

With all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. 

Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Keely Hodgkinson won Olympic gold in the 800m in 2024

Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson has pulled out of Sunday's Stockholm Diamond League event after suffering a setback in her recovery from a hamstring injury.

The 23-year-old was ruled out of the Keely Klassic - a new athletics event she founded - in February after tearing her hamstring.

She had been due to return on Sunday in Sweden for her first competitive outing of 2025. 

The race would have seen Hodgkinson come up against Olympic rivals Tsige Duguma of Ethopia and Mary Moraa of Kenya, who won silver and bronze in Paris respectively. 

However, BBC Sport has been told that Hodgkinson's return has been further delayed after a setback in her recovery from the hamstring issue that ended her indoor season.

Hodgkinson, who was awarded an MBE last month, won 800m gold in Paris last summer with a stunning one minute 56.72 seconds run.

While no timeframe has been put on Hodgkinson's return, she hopes to compete in September's World Championships in Tokyo, Japan.

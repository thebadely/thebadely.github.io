Here’s what you need to know: A golfer crowned champion of his club won the title in style by achieving not one, but two holes in one in his first round.

Gavin Bourne was competing in his Club Championship Match Play Final at Droitwich Golf Club, Worcestershire, on Sunday when he managed the amazing feat.

He struck lucky on the third and 15th holes - with the odds of two aces in a round estimated to be 67 million to one, according to England Golf.

"Every golfer's dream is to have a hole in one and then to have two in one round is just absolutely incredible," he said.

The 47-year-old who has a 0.4 handicap, was playing in the first round of a 36-hole final when he first got an ace.

"I hit it. It was bang on line and as soon as it landed, Tom, my playing partner said, 'that's in that is'," Mr Bourne explained. 

"Walking up to the green, Tom as well had hit it to about four or five foot, and there was only one ball on the green and a pitch mark about three foot in front of the hole.

"It was mad as obviously it's every golfer's dream to have a hole in one, so I was in shock to be honest."

But then 12 holes later he repeated the same feat.

"Our club captain, who was refereeing the match.. had actually seen the ball go in...and fair play, he kept his calm till Tom hit his tee shot then all of a sudden he's just appeared with his arms in the air.

"I'm thinking he's just trying to find where my ball went so I just pointed forward and said, 'It's up there somewhere', and he's put his arms in the air again and took a picture of the hole.

"I was like, 'No way. You're having a me on here'."

Mr Bourne said he felt a numb and in shock when he realised what he had achieved.

"You can't really put it into words to be honest," he said. 

The heating engineer, who has played golf for more than 30 years, said he only had one hole-in-one when he was a junior – although he had made two aces during evening rounds on his own, the last being more than a decade ago.

But he got a bottle of whiskey and some drinks in afterwards, in keeping with tradition, he added.

His skills have now seen him qualify to play at Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, at Sir Nick Faldo's course in a Champion of Champions for the Faldo Commemoration Jug, he said.

"I wish someone would have told me the odds before I played - I would have had a quid on that," he added.

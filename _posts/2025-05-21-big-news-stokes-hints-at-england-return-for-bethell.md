Here’s what you need to know: Jacob Bethell scored half-centuries in each of the three Tests in New Zealand

Captain Ben Stokes has given a strong hint that Jacob Bethell will come straight back into the England team for the series against India later this summer.

Bethell, 21, impressed in his debut series in New Zealand before Christmas but is missing Thursday's one-off Test against Zimbabwe because he is playing for Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Bethell's return for the five Tests against India, beginning on 20 June, could come at the expense of opener Zak Crawley or, more likely, number three Ollie Pope.

"If you're smart enough, the series that Beth had out in New Zealand, obviously he's going to be back in the UK for that India series," said Stokes.

"So, I think you put two and two together, you probably know what's going to happen."

Any change to a long-established top order would be a huge decision for England, given the significance of the series against India and the Ashes in Australia that follow.

But Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum have shown they will not shy away from big calls or investing in youth. In the past year the likes of James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Jack Leach, Ben Foakes and Ollie Robinson have been discarded in favour of Shoaib Bashir, Jamie Smith and Gus Atkinson.

Left-hander Bethell only got his chance to play in New Zealand after an injury to Jordan Cox. As a result, Pope kept wicket and batted at number six, leaving Bethell at number three despite never previously batting higher than four for his county Warwickshire.

He responded by making half-centuries in each of the three Tests, impressing with his temperament and strokeplay. In the third Test, Bethell made 76 amid a ferocious spell from New Zealand pace bowler Will O'Rourke, coping with the hostility better than Joe Root and Harry Brook.

Speaking to BBC Sport, Stokes said: "You look at what Beth did in the winter for us, he has done himself the world of good by the performances he put in there with being part of our plans going forward."

There is an argument that England should have insisted Bethell, who is centrally contracted, played in the Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge.

But pulling him out of the IPL would have risked confrontation with the Board of Control for Cricket in India. There is also a feeling that his time with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, where he opened the batting with India legend Virat Kohli, is more beneficial to his development.

Bethell is yet to score a century in professional cricket, though England feel they have seen enough in New Zealand and his appearances in white-ball internationals to suggest he will have a successful Test career.

Although the evidence is limited, Bethell certainly has the potential to outstrip both Crawley and Pope, who have middling returns from what are now lengthy England careers. Crawley averages 30.51 from his 53 Tests, Pope 34.02 from 55.

Crawley has endured a difficult few months. Struggles in New Zealand, where he averaged less than nine and was dismissed in all six innings by Matt Henry, were carried into the South Africa T20 league. He has at least made half-centuries in each of his past three matches for Kent.

England have been willing to excuse Crawley's inconsistency for the impact he can have at top of the order. He memorably hit the first ball of the last Ashes series for four and followed up with a sensational 189 in the fourth Test at Old Trafford. He has also formed a strong opening partnership with Ben Duckett.

Pope, therefore, is vulnerable, despite again being confirmed as England's vice-captain by Stokes on Wednesday.

If he does lose his place, it would be unfortunate given his willingness to adapt for England over the past year. At various times he has been captain, wicketkeeper, opener, number three and number six. Indeed, he slipped down the order to make way for Bethell.

Pope endured a rollercoaster 2024 with the bat. His 196 in the first Test against India in Hyderabad was one of the greatest overseas innings played by an Englishman in Test history, but he was inconsistent thereafter. Pope averaged 33.13, the lowest for any batter in Test cricket to have scored three hundreds in a calendar year.

Following the series in New Zealand, head coach McCullum appeared to give greater backing to Crawley than to Pope.

Speaking on Wednesday, McCullum said: "It's a problem that we want, and our guys know that. Ultimately, our currency is runs.

"We do need to keep putting up performances to be earning the opportunity to keep getting picked, and especially when you get surrounded with good cricketers throughout your country. So it's a good problem to have, but, again, what a great opportunity these guys have got in front of them."

England have also regularly talked up the advantages of Bethell's left-arm spin. In recent times spin has not played a prominent role in Tests in Australia, so Bethell would give the option of playing an Ashes Test without a specialist spinner.

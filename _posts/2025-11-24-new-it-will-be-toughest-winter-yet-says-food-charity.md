According to new developments, A food charity helping people in deprived areas across Surrey and Sussex says this winter could be the toughest yet for its users.

FareShare Sussex & Surrey provides food parcels, supports community pantries, and cooks hot meals in group and residential settings for those in need.

The charity says a combination of "incredibly high" food and energy costs mean more people are turning to it for help - about 28,500 every week.

To keep up with demand, FareShare is trying to raise £50,000 between 2-9 December, which it says will help it to provide 200,000 meals.

FareShare is working with The Big Give, a fund-matching group, which will double all money raised during that week.

Dan Slatter, CEO of FareShare Sussex & Surrey, said: "Your support could help a parent feed their children without going hungry themselves, or enable an elderly neighbour to turn on their heating while still having food on their plate.

"This winter may be the toughest yet for many people in our communities as food and energy costs remain incredibly high, and we are seeing an urgent demand for our services."

The charity also says "unusually late harvests" have led to less winter produce, putting further strain on surplus food supplies.

Martin Vodden, chairman of Trustees Foodwise Limited, which runs Shopwise in Woking, said: "FareShare Sussex & Surrey's support is what keeps our shelves well-stocked.

"Without our weekly deliveries of fresh fruit, vegetables and staples, we simply would not be able to operate."

FareShare Sussex & Surrey says it rescues and redistributes surplus food from businesses, supermarkets, manufacturers and farms from its depots in Guildford and Brighton to 248 local organisations across the two counties.

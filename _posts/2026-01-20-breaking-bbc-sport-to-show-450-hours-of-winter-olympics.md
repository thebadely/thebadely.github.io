Let's dive into the details: TV coverage will be led by Hazel Irvine, Clare Balding and Jeanette Kwakye

The BBC will broadcast more than 450 hours of live action from next month's Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina.

The Games, which run from Friday 6 to Sunday 22 February, are the most accessible to UK audiences for two decades.

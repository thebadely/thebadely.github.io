Let's dive into the details: Robertson took charge of the All Blacks after leading Crusaders to seven successive Super Rugby titles

Quilter Nations Series: England v New Zealand

Venue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham Date: Saturday, 15 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Live on BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website and app

Coaching the All Blacks is one of the most pressurised jobs in world rugby, but current incumbent Scott Robertson says he is determined to "turn the expectation into joy" as his side bid for a Grand Slam tour.

Despite an inconsistent first two years in charge by All Blacks standards - 19 wins and six defeats in 25 matches - Robertson and his side are in London this week with a first home nations clean sweep since 2010 in their sights.

The All Blacks dug deep to battle past Ireland in Chicago before withstanding a Scottish fightback in Edinburgh last weekend. 

And with England resurgent, unbeaten in nine games and looking for a first victory over New Zealand at home since 2012, the stage is perfectly set for their meeting with England on Saturday at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham.

"It's at the so-called home of rugby, with a full house and an expectant English team," he tells the Rugby Union Weekly podcast from the All Blacks' team hotel.

"We want a Grand Slam; they want to take our scalp. How good is footy?

"This is why I'm doing the job and that's where the enjoyment starts. There is a fine balance - you feel like you are never satisfied, but you love it."

With a host of All Blacks greats leaving the international stage since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, New Zealand are still in a state of transition under Robertson.

While there have been some stirring wins, such as over South Africa at Eden Park to maintain their unbeaten run in Auckland, a record defeat by the Springboks a week later and two losses to Argentina on Robertson's watch have muted the enthusiasm of the New Zealand rugby public.

"In its entirety we've had some great results and we've fought back from some great adversity," Robertson explains.

"We've played some really good footy and exposed 20 debutants over the past two years. We've got a lot of guys who have stepped up and we feel we have a good foundation."

But while it is not a vintage All Blacks side yet, they are still ranked number two in the world and boast a handful of superstars, from backrowers Ardie Savea and Wallace Sititi to generational players like Beauden Barrett and Will Jordan behind the scrum.

And according to Robertson, the group is determined to make the most of a rare chance to play all four home nations in consecutive weekends.

"It just keeps giving," Robertson says about the end-of-year tour.

"You have 13 Test matches in a year, and every week [is huge]. You beat the All Blacks and you've had a great year. So every team [wants the scalp].

"So you have got to embrace it. How do you take all that expectation and turn it into joy? That's the art of coaching."

Mark Tele'a (number 14) scored the decisive try in the teams' meeting at Twickenham last autumn

Three times Robertson's New Zealand met Steve Borthwick's England last year, and three times England were ahead after an hour only for the All Blacks to turn the screw in the final quarter.

It has been a similar story over the past fortnight, as the All Blacks finished strongly to edge out Ireland and Scotland.

And with Borthwick stacking his bench this weekend, keen to rectify the problems of a year ago, both head coaches are planning for it to go down to the wire at the Allianz Stadium.

"The first thing is you have to trust yourself and keep playing," Robertson says about those decisive minutes.

"That is the key, and that's what we have done, and I'm sure that is what England are focusing on as well.

"Who is going to put their hand up, and who is going to take that moment?

"As a player you need to make sure you revel in those moments. It is your time now, this is the week and you have to make the most of it."

According to new developments, Marks & Spencer has resumed its click and collect service 15 weeks after it stopped the service following a hugely damaging cyber attack.

The retailer stopped taking orders on its website and app for clothing and home deliveries and also paused its in store collection service on 25 April.

Online orders resumed on 10 June and the company has now announced on its website that click and collect has resumed.

The firm said customers can also now return their online orders to any M&S store.

Some customer data was stolen in the attack and customers have been advised to remain cautious about receiving emails, calls or texts claiming to be from M&S.

As well as disrupting its online business, the hack affected the company in-store too, leaving some shelves bare in the days after it was first targeted.

M&S estimates the cyber attack will reduce profits for the current year by around Â£300m.

It hopes some of the loss will be covered by insurance.

In July, M&S chief executive Stuart Machin told investors that the retailer would be over the worst of the aftermath of the incident by August.

M&S has not revealed who or what was behind the cyber incident on its systems, but has previously acknowledged it was a ransomware attack.

In May, the National Crime Agency (NCA) named the cyber-criminal collective Scattered Spider as a key part of their investigation.

Then in July, four people were arrested by police investigating the cyber-attacks at both M&S and the Co-op.

All four individuals were later bailed pending further inquiries.

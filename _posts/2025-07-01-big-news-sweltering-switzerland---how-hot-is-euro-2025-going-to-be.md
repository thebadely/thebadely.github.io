Let's dive into the details: With temperatures soaring in Switzerland, Uefa's hot weather protocol may come into effect during games, with players allowed water breaks if the wet bulb globe temperature exceeds 32C on the pitch.

Switzerland may be known for its snow-covered mountains, cosy chalets and world-class skiing, but the sun-scorched country is looking very different for Euro 2025.

As 16 teams prepare to begin their Euro 2025 campaigns, temperatures are soaring across the host nation.

With fears that the grass could burn, huge fans have been placed pitch-side to help keep the turf cool, while supporters have been advised to stay in the shade and keep hydrated.

So how hot is it going to get? And what other precautions are tournament organisers taking to keep players and fans safe in the heat?

Like most of Europe, temperatures in Switzerland are expected to be about 10C above average for the time of year. You can see the high mountains, where temperatures are lower because of the altitude, picked out in yellow and green.

The Swiss authorities have issued amber heatwave warnings across the country until Thursday, with temperatures set to be about 10C above average for this time of year.

Temperatures could rise to highs of 35C, while there's also the threat of thunderstorms causing heavy downpours towards the end of the week.

For the earlier kick-offs at 18:00 CET (17:00 BST), it is expected temperatures will be between 27 and 30C.

But it's predicted to be cooler - between 24 and 27C - for the later 21:00 CET kick-offs.

The tournament begins on Wednesday as Iceland play Finland in Thun in the 17:00 BST game, with the temperature forecast to be 28C.

However, it's expected to be 29C when hosts Switzerland face Norway in Basel later that evening.

The heatwave is set to last until Monday, when temperatures are expected to drop by 10C to highs of 23C. 

The weather conditions might be different to what the Wales and England players are used to, but Wales defender Gemma Evans says "it's pointless using it as an excuse".

Her team-mate Rachel Rowe agreed, adding: "It's the same for everybody isn't it?

"It's been hot, but we've had our week in Portugal to prepare so I feel like we're really on our way now to being able to perform in that weather."

Wales forward Elise Hughes added: "We've got support staff around us that make sure that we're in the best place possible, hydration and nutrition-wise, and we haven't spent time in the sun outside of training."

Uefa delegates will measure the temperature with a wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) thermometer at the end of the teams' warm-ups.

Different from a normal thermometer, the WBGT thermometer accounts for temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover to determine the heat.

If the WBGT temperature exceeds 32C, cooling breaks - which can last between 90 seconds and three minutes - will be introduced for players during the match.

If the temperature is below those thresholds, the implementation of drinks breaks is at the discretion of the referee.

A heat warning has been issued by Uefa for all matches on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, with fans allowed to bring a water bottle up to half a litre in size into the stadium on those days.

Uefa has also encouraged fans to re-fill their bottles and cups in the stadium bathrooms, and to seek shade in the fan zones across the country.

By the time Wales face the Netherlands in the opening Group D match on Saturday (17:00 BST), it is likely that the temperature will have dropped.

Wales' first ever game at a major tournament will be played in Lucerne, where thundery showers and light winds are forecast, along with a highs of 30C.

When England and France play later that day in Zurich's Stadion Letzigrund, the temperature should have dropped to 25C by 21:00 CET, while there's only a slight chance of rain.

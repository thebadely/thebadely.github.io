Experts revealed that A charity has been shortlisted for an award  after helping vulnerable households keep warm during the winter months.  

Gloucestershire charity Severn Wye started its Warm Homes Prescription pilot in 2022. Patients with respiratory, coronary, or complex health conditions, on low incomes, are given grants to help with their energy bills, using government funding.

The charity said the aim of the project is to help prevent the need for hospital care.

Anton Hammer, 72, who suffers from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease said he was constantly visiting his GP with recurrent chest infections before the charity helped him.

After stopping work two years ago, following a heart attack, Hammer said he struggled to heat his home. 

"You think I can't afford to do this, so you keep the heating off. You put more layers on, or you try to heat one room in the entire house," he said. 

"It can be very depressing. It can make you feel very down."

His GP at Brockworth Surgery put him in touch with Severn Wye who visited him at home and offered help.

"I've got to say they've been fantastic," he added.

Hammer said his chest infections have since alleviated dramatically meaning fewer GP visits. 

The 'Warmth on Prescription' scheme has been running alongside the NHS Retrofit project funded by NHS Gloucestershire Integrated Care Board, which provided up to £20,000 per property to install measures to improve home energy efficiency.

Both projects are finalists in the Health Service Journal Partnership Awards.

Last winter, patients on the scheme reported fewer clinical visits and fewer hospital visits, according to Severn Wye.

NHS Gloucestershire deputy chief medical officer, Dr Hein Le Roux said he is "pleased to see" the partnership with the charity "recognised".

"Patients tell us they feel more confident and supported through winter, which is exactly the impact we set out to achieve," he said.

Winners for the Health Service Journal Partnership Awards will be announced in March.

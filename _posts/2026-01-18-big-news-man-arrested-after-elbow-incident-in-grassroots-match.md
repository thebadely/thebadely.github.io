Experts revealed that Porthmadog are second in the Ardal North West League - three places and 13 points above Trearddur Bay

A man has been arrested on suspicion of assault after an incident during a match in Wales' third tier on Saturday.

North Wales Police said a 35-year-old was in custody following the Ardal North West League game between amateur sides Trearddur Bay and Porthmadog FC on 17 January.

Trearddur Bay initially said on Sunday that Tom Taylor had been suspended after a video showed him appearing to elbow a Porthmadog FC player in the face.

In a second statement - after an emergency general meeting of the committee - they announced he had been released by the club. 

Footage of the incident at Y Traeth (The Beach) stadium in Gwynedd has circulated widely on social media.

North Wales Police said in a statement they were aware of the video.

"Officers have been making enquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident," they said. "As part of this investigation, a 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault. He remains in police custody at this time.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we would ask members of the public not to speculate whilst the investigation continues."

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) confirmed to BBC Sport Wales it was looking into the incident.

A statement read: "Tier-three matches fall under the jurisdiction of the FAW. The FAW is aware of the incident and will be reviewing it."

Match data shows referee Richard Gwyn Edwards did not issue any red cards during the contest, which was won 3-2 by hosts Porthmadog.

In their statement announcing Taylor had been released, Trearddur Bay apologised for the incident.

"Trearddur Bay Football Club does not condone violence in any form and acknowledges that the incident should not have occurred," they said.

"The club offers its sincere apologies to the opposition player involved,  Porthmadog FC, match officials, supporters, and the wider football community.

"The club will fully cooperate with any external investigations or disciplinary processes and will make no further comment at this time while these matters are ongoing."

Porthmadog released a statement saying that the safety of their player was their main concern.

"The club would like to emphasise that its major concern is for the welfare and safety of our player Danny Brookwell. Danny was concussed and following treatment had to leave the field of play," they said.

"It is our understanding that he is recovering at home."

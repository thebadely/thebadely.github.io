Experts revealed that Hugo Ekitike has scored four goals in seven games for Liverpool this season

On a night when Liverpool celebrated the goalscoring arrival of their record signing Alexander Isak, a moment of madness has proved costly for their other in-form forward.

Hugo Ekitike scored the winner in Tuesday's 2-1 victory against Southampton to progress to the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.

But, caught up in the moment of his 85th-minute goal, striker Ekitike removed his shirt and held it up to the Liverpool fans in celebration.

He most likely knew he would get booked for that and was happy it was a price worth paying, but what he had seemingly forgotten is that he had already been shown a yellow card.

The sending-off means he will be suspended for Saturday's Premier League game at Crystal Palace - not ideal when the player he is potentially in a battle for a starting spot with is returning to full fitness.

Ekitike went on social media on Tuesday night to apologise, saying: "I was so excited to help the team achieve another victory here in our home for my first Carabao Cup match. 

"The emotion got the better of me. My apologies to all the Red family. Thanks to the fans who always support us and to my team-mates for this victory!"

But, speaking just after the game, his manager Arne Slot was left bemused by the incident.

"It is not [stupid] because it was his second [yellow] - it's stupid even if you haven't had a yellow card yet," he said. 

"Maybe I'm a bit old-fashioned but I did score a few goals - not at his level but I did - and if I went past three players and put it in the top corner then maybe you can say 'this is all about me'. 

"But if I scored a goal like he did tonight, I would turn to Chiesa and say 'it's about you Federico - great assist, great run and I didn't have to do a lot'. Maybe that's me being old-school. 

"It was stupid, not smart in every sense. The good thing is that his team-mates helped him to get the win over the line, but the thing is he is now suspended for Saturday and that is far from ideal."

Hugo Ekitike will serve a one-match suspension as a result of his sending-off

Liverpool signed Ekitike for Â£69m in July from Eintracht Frankfurt and he has started the season in excellent form.

Leading the line while the Reds completed the deal for Isak and then took their time working the Sweden forward up to full fitness, he has scored three goals in five Premier League games and provided one assist. 

That has helped Liverpool win every game they have played since their Community Shield defeat by Crystal Palace on 10 August, and underlines his importance to the team, regardless of his unnecessary dismissal on Tuesday.

Indeed, both cards he picked up were needless. Replacing Isak for the start of the second half he was booked soon after when he threw the ball in the air after being penalised for a foul.

"For Ekitike to get a second yellow card for that [taking his shirt off] is just sheer stupidity," former Premier League striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"He's been such an important player for Liverpool so far this season - what a start to his Liverpool career, important goal [against Southampton] - but that's not great for Arne Slot if he's sitting out the game at the weekend."

The main thing Ekitike is likely to take from this is an important learning experience.

"I'd be very surprised if he does it again," added Slot.

"He probably forgot he got a yellow. He's young and he will learn from it. I'm sure he won't do it again."

Isak has had his playing time carefully managed since joining Liverpool. 

His two starts have been in cup competitions - playing 58 minutes against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on 17 September and then this first-half appearance against Southampton.

In the Premier League he has made just one appearance - coming off the bench in the 67th minute in the 2-1 win against Everton at the weekend.

Isak's half-time departure against the Saints was likely because Slot had one eye on the weekend as well, so may have already been planning to give him more game time at Crystal Palace.

As well as scoring against Southampton, he also had a big chance early on but fired straight at goalkeeper Alex McCarthy.

"I feel good," Isak told ITV. "With every game I play it is very helpful and gets me in better shape."

On if he feels ready to start, he added: "It is difficult to say. It is a mixture of fitness-wise and football-wise. 

"I feel good and feel I am in a shape to make a difference."

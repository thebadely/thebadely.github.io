Let's dive into the details: Prince Harry has visited Kyiv after an invitation by the Ukrainian government, the Guardian has reported.

The Duke of Sussex said he wanted to do "everything possible" to help the recovery of military staff injured in the war with Russia.

He is set to detail new initiatives to help the rehabilitation of those wounded during the trip alongside a team from his Invictus Games Foundation, the paper reports.

It comes after he met his father King Charles in London on Wednesday - their first face to face meeting since February 2024.

The prince said he was initially invited by the founder of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, which he visited in April to meet war victims being rehabilitated.

Ahead of the visit, he told the Guardian: "We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process."

"We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through."

Prince Harry launched the Invictus Games in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events. During its opening ceremony in 2022, when Ukraine's team was given special permission to compete by President Volodymyr Zelensky, the prince said the world was "united" with Ukraine.

Other members of the Royal Family have expressed support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The King welcomed Zelensky to his Sandringham estate in Norfolk in March, having previously said Ukraine had faced "indescribable aggression" from Russia.

The Prince of Wales, Harry's brother, met Ukrainian refugees during a two-day visit to Estonia in March - where he said their resilience was "amazing".

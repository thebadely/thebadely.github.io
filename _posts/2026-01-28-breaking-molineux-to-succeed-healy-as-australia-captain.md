According to new developments, Sophie Molinex has made 58 appearances for Australia across all formats

Australia have named all-rounder Sophie Molineux as their women's captain across all formats to take over from the retiring Alyssa Healy.

Wicketkeeper Healy announced earlier this month she will retire from all forms of cricket following the upcoming multi-format series against India.

Healy, 35, is not part of the squad for the T20 internationals that start the series, so Molineux, 28, will take charge of Australia for the first time in the opener on 15 February.

She will then be Healy's deputy for the following one-day internationals and the one-off Test in Perth, which will be Healy's final professional appearance.

"It's a real honour to be named Australian captain and something I'm incredibly proud of, especially following on from Alyssa, who's had such a huge impact on this team and the game," said Molineux.

"We've got a really strong group with plenty of natural leaders, alongside a lot of exciting talent coming through. I'm really looking forward to working together as we keep evolving and pushing ourselves to the next level, while staying true to the identity that makes this team so special."

Australia host India in three T20s, three ODIs and one Test between 15 February and 9 March.

Australia have also announced Ashleigh Gardner will become vice-captain alongside fellow all-rounder Tahlia McGrath, who already held the role, across all formats.

Molineux captains her state side Victoria and Melbourne Renegades in the Women's Big Bash League and led them to their first title in 2024.

She has made three Test, 17 ODI and 38 T20 appearances for Australia since her international debut in 2019 but has not played Test or T20 international cricket since 2024 because of a knee injury.

Molinuex won the 2018 and 2020 T20 World Cup titles with Australia but her career has also been blighted by injury.

A stress fracture in her foot in late 2021 caused her to miss the 50-over World Cup and Commonwealth Games in 2022 - both of which Australia won.

Molinuex subsequently ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and was out for 12 months, missing her country's victorious 2023 T20 World Cup campaign.

She returned for the 2024 T20 World Cup, where Australia were stunned by eventual runners-up South Africa in the semi-finals. One of Molieux's main goals this year will be winning the title back when the T20 World Cup in England starts on 12 June.

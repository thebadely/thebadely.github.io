According to new developments, The World Aquatics Swimming World Cup takes place over three weekends, from 10-25 October

Abbie Wood won two of Great Britain's three medals at the first event of the Swimming World Cup in Carmel, Indiana.

Wood followed Saturday's gold in the women's 400m medley with a silver medal in the 200m medley on Sunday.

Matt Richards added bronze in the men's 200m freestyle.

Meanwhile, Britain's three-time Olympic gold medallist Adam Peaty competed for the first time since Paris 2024.

The 30-year-old finished sixth in the men's 50m breaststroke final, but narrowly missed out on qualification for the 100m and 200m finals.

The second leg of the World Cup takes place in Westmont, Illinois on 17-19 October, with the final event being held in the Canadian city of Toronto on 23-25 October.

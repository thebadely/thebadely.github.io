According to new developments, A 2024 WNBA rookie card of Caitlin Clark, signed by the Indiana Fever star herself, has sold for $660,000 (Â£491,116) - more than double the previous women's record. 

Extended bidding began at $336,000 before spiking to its final sale price at the auction hosted by memorabilia and trading card company Fanatics Collect.

The one-of-one Rookie Royalty WNBA Flawless Platinum Logowoman card features Clark's signature, inked in blue, and a photo of her mid-dribble, shin bloodied.

Clark developed a massive following as a once-in-a-generation women's college basketball athlete, and the buzz of her fandom has followed her into the WNBA.

The previous record for highest-selling women's sports card was also Clark's, which sold for $366,000 in March. 

The card that sold on Thursday night includes her photo, signature and a patch from Clark's Fever uniform that was worn while she played.

It also includes the words "769 pts and counting", written by Clark, a reference to the record she broke last year for points scored as a rookie.

Clark now has 14 cards featuring her that have sold at public auctions for sums that far exceed her salary for a season, which is estimated at roughly $80,000. 

She has been off the court since suffering a groin injury on 15 July, and her team has said there is no timeline for her return as the season grinds on.

The 23-year-old was already a major celebrity athlete when she joined the women's professional league last year, having won back-to-back NCAA championships with the Iowa Hawkeyes, and setting the all-time Division I scoring record for both men and women.

Clark was drafted as the first overall pick by the Fever in 2024 and was later named rookie of the year.

Since joining the team, she has set multiple WNBA records, including assists in a single game and in a season.

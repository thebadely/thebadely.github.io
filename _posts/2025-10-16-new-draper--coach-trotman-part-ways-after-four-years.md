Experts revealed that James Trotman (right) has been an ever-present with Jack Draper over the past four years

Jack Draper will no longer work with the man who coached him to the Indian Wells title as James Trotman wants to prioritise time with his family.

The British number one has already hired Jamie Delgado as his head coach for next season but had been hoping there would also be a role for the man with whom he has enjoyed much success over the past four years.

Trotman says it has become increasingly difficult to "juggle" Draper's career with his own family life.

"I've made the decision that four years has been a great run," Trotman told BBC Sport.

"I've thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was getting increasingly difficult for me juggling the demands Jack deserves as the player that he is - and also being a father and a husband.

"I need to start to get those energy levels back up and have a little bit more normality - watch my son play football on a Sunday, go on some family holidays, have a bit more of a normal life."

Trotman says he first spoke to Draper about his future after Wimbledon, having felt mentally and physically tired over the previous year.

The pair have been working together this week, with 23-year-old Draper returning to the practice court after resting the left arm injury that ended his season early.

If the bruising in his arm heals as expected, Trotman will head to San Diego for some warm weather training with Draper and Delgado at the end of November.

But after that, he will return to his job as an LTA men's national coach.

"My relationship with Jack is strong. We are extremely close," Trotman continued.

"We spent more time with each other than anybody else on the planet over the past four years.

"We are going to stay incredibly close and obviously I'll be following and supporting in any way I can from the sidelines."

As well as winning the Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells in March, Draper hit a career-high world ranking of four in June.

Last year, he reached the US Open semi-finals and won his first two ATP titles.

"Whatever Jack does in the future, I feel incredibly proud of the work that I've done," Trotman said.

"And where Jack is now, is not just as a result of me, it's a result of everybody that's worked with Jack and his family from a young age."

Draper is due to make his comeback at the three-day UTS Grand Final in London in December, and is also expected to play an exhibition in Macau later that month.

As the top-ranked British player, he will then have the opportunity to start next season by representing his country in the United Cup mixed team competition in Sydney and Perth.

Delgado will be in full charge by then, and Trotman speaks highly of a man he has known since he was 12.

"One of the few people we could have worked really well together with was Jamie," Trotman added.

"I have a huge respect for him as a person and as a coach and the job that he has done with Gilles Muller, Andy [Murray] and more recently with Grigor [Dimitrov]."

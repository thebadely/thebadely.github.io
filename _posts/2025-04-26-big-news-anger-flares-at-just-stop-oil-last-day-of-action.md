According to new developments, A van appears to have been driven slowly into Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters as hundreds marched through London for their "last day of action".

A mass of people wearing JSO's orange vests rallied in Westminster on Saturday after the group claimed a victory on new oil and gas licences and said "we're hanging up the hi vis".

The group has drawn attention, criticism and jail terms for protests ranging from throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers and spray-painting Charles Darwin's grave, to climbing on M25 gantries.

During the march, a man in a white minivan appeared to edge it forwards until it was pressed against protesters. Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away.

The minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger.

People standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police "officer, I'm being pushed back".

The driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked.

Police reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest.

Other similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera.

In its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: "Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history.

"We've kept over 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful."

The Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution.

Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.

The Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment.

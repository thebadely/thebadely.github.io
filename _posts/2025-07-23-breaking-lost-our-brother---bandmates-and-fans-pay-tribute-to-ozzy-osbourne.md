According to new developments, Fans, musicians and former bandmates have paid tribute to Ozzy Osbourne, the frontman of pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, who has died aged 76.

Black Sabbath have "lost our brother", said the band's co-founder Tony Iommi, while bassist Terence "Geezer" Butler remembered their final gig and drummer Bill Ward shared a photo of them together.

The music icon's death on Tuesday, announced by his family, came just weeks after his band played their farewell gig in his home city of Birmingham.

"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning," his family said. "He was with his family and surrounded by love."

Osbourne, known for energetic and controversial live shows, inspired a generation of musicians. 

"It's impossible to put into words what Ozzy Osbourne has meant to Metallica," the band said in a statement on X. "Hero, icon, pioneer, inspiration, mentor, and, most of all, friend are a few that come to mind."

Henry Rollins, former frontman of hardcore band Black Flag, said it was "rare that somebody can be so synonymous" with a specific musical genre.

"But if you want to talk about heavy metal, first up it's Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath. Everyone else comes after."

American rock band Aerosmith called him "our brother in rock", sending their love to "the millions around the world who felt his fire".

Osbourne's bandmates in Black Sabbath all shared separate tributes on social media. 

Drummer Bill Ward looked back at their time together and said: "Where will I find you now? In the memories, our unspoken embraces, our missed phone calls? No, you're forever in my heart."

Guitarist Tony Iommi said it "there won't ever be another like him", while bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler wrote: "Goodbye dear friend. Thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. Four kids from Aston - who'd have thought, eh?" 

Less than three weeks ago, the self-styled "prince of darkness" performed in Birmingham supported by many of the musicians he had inspired, including Metallica and Guns 'n' Roses.

Billy Corgan, lead singer of The Smashing Pumpkins - one of the many bands that performed alongside them - said: "Some of the biggest musical artists in the world travelled from all over the world to be there literally to celebrate the legacy of this band.

"It's one of the greatest musical moments of my life," added Corgan, who spoke to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.

"For him to have been that close to death on July 5 and still get up there and perform like he promised... Wow! That puts him in a category of his own," Sammy Hagar, the lead vocalist of Van Halen who also played at the farewell concert for Osbourne, wrote on Instagram.

AC/DC posted that Osbourne's death was a "great loss to all that loved him", while Kiss bassist Gene Simmons told NBC News that behind the outgoing stage persona was a "loving father" and "dedicated husband".

Sir Elton John posted on Instagram: "So sad to hear the news of Ozzy Osbourne passing away.

"He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods - a true legend.

"He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love."

Foo Fighters wrote that "Rock and Roll would not be as loud or as fun" without Osbourne; while Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant said he had "truly changed the planet of rock".

Others shared fond memories of Osbourne's larger-than-life character.

Variety magazine's senior entertainment editor Jem Aswad recalled the first time he met Osbourne, he was "nervous" to meet the prince of darkness.

"It was just this sort of really bizarre scene," Aswad told the BBC.

Osbourne entered the room near noon in a bathrobe, having "just woken up", wearing loads of jewellery and accessories and "a lot of gold", Aswad said, though adding that Osbourne was "perfectly nice, perfectly friendly".

Meanwhile, fans gathered at the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, where they laid flowers on the star dedicated to Osbourne. 

"Osbourne was more than a rock legend - he was a cultural icon who reshaped music and defied expectations," said Ana Martinez, the venue's producer.

Black Sabbath were pioneers in the heavy metal genre of music, writing classic tracks like Paranoid, War Pigs and Iron Man.

After leaving the band in 1979 over rising tensions with its other members, Osbourne had a lengthy solo music career releasing more than a dozen albums. His debut single released the next year, Crazy Train, is arguably one of his most famous songs.

Osbourne is survived by his wife Sharon and six children, three from each of his two marriages.

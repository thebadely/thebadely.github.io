Man City come from behind to beat Plymouth

You're unlikely to see global superstars such as Erling Haaland or Kevin de Bruyne doing their weekly shop in the giant supermarket just across from Manchester City's Etihad complex.

But head to the nearby area of Collyhurst and you may just spot City's latest gem Nico O'Reilly picking up some milk and bread.

O'Reilly has been a breakthrough star in a disappointing City season - and was called "very humble" by team-mate Ilkay Gundogan following another vital contribution in the victory over Everton last month.

That's an accurate description, as BBC Sport met the shy, but confident 20-year-old, before Saturday's FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.

He says his friends and family help him stay grounded as he prepares for the biggest game of his fledgling career.

"I would say I've still got the same friends, I still do the same stuff, I still go to Tesco with my mum, stuff like this," O'Reilly says.

"My friends are all really in the football industry anyway They are all at different clubs, mainly my friends when I was in the youth team."

In football, O'Reilly knows Manchester City and little else.

A boyhood fan of the club, he has progressed through City's age groups since signing with the academy aged eight and insiders say the potential he displayed always made him destined for the first-team.

After captaining the Under-18s side to the Premier League title in that particular category in 2023 - and impressing in the elite development squad last season - he made his breakthrough into the senior side at the start of this term.

It was capped with a dream first appearance which came in the Community Shield penalty-shootout win over rivals Manchester United at Wembley.

"It's an amazing feeling," says the 20-year-old. "Even just being around the team every day is an amazing feeling.

"At the start of the season, because it is my first full season with the first team, it was a bit crazy to get my head around, but as the season has gone on, I have felt more comfortable."

Despite being an elegant midfielder and describing himself as a box-to-box player, City's injury crisis in defence has meant most of O'Reilly's 18 games this season have come at the unfamiliar position of left-back.

Manager Pep Guardiola has admitted that is not his position, highlighted by the five goals he has scored so far, and although O'Reilly watched the likes of Yaya Toure and David Silva growing up, he was keen to stress he is his own man.

"Obviously there's very big players here at the club and I watched them quite a lot," he says. "Maybe I have attributes from certain players, but I don't compare myself to anyone.

"Not even in a confident way, but all these players have done so much and I have not done anywhere near that, so I couldn't compare myself to someone like that."

O'Reilly has scored five goals and provided two assists this season

City - and O'Reilly - have grown accustomed to winning but the team have fallen short of the high standards they have set in recent seasons.

They have been deposed at the top of the Premier League by new champions Liverpool, relinquishing their four-year grip on the trophy, while being knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off stage.

Last Saturday's shock goalless draw against rock-bottom Southampton leaves them in a fight to finish in the top five with two games remaining and, in turn, qualifying for the Champions League next season.

"I have found that the players have been positive for the majority of it," said O'Reilly.

"These are players that have won everything and they are still trying to improve so we can get these wins. I think it has helped my mindset and how to approach things.

"We have had a tough season, however there are positives to take out of it. We are just going to try and finish as well as we can now."

O'Reilly says boss Guardiola "drives the intensity" at the club and "gets us all going", telling the players to "go out there and enjoy it".

At one stage in the campaign, City went on a wretched run of one win in 13 games but boss Guardiola told BBC Sport the upturn in results since "would be difficult to imagine" without O'Reilly's contributions.

Victory on Saturday can provide some satisfaction to an otherwise disappointing campaign.

His standout performances have come in the competition, scoring in the 8-0 thrashing of Salford in the third round, netting twice against Plymouth and turning the game around against Bournemouth by creating both goals after appearing as a half-time substitute.

Now for O'Reilly, getting his hands on a first major trophy in his maiden season as a professional awaits.

"Personally, it would mean a lot for me to get some silverware," he says.

"Obviously coming through the youth stages, you have got the FA Youth Cup, which is - I'd say - the biggest tournament in youth football. Everyone wants to play in that.

"Then to transition through to the first team, you have got the FA Cup, where a lot of youth players do get chances.

"It is an amazing tournament and it would be amazing to win it."

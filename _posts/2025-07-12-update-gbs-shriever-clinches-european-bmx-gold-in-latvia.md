According to new developments, Beth Shriever won Olympic gold in 2021

Great Britain's Beth Shriever won gold at the BMX Racing European Championships in Valmiera, Latvia.

Shriever, 26, claimed her first championship podium of the season with a time of 35.275 seconds, ahead of sisters Merel and Laura Smulders of the Netherlands.

The Tokyo Olympic champion has bounced back from a disappointing Paris Games, where she lost her title despite winning all six races in the lead up.

She won the World Cup in Papendal, Netherlands last month, after claiming first and second-place finishes for the first two rounds of the European Cup earlier this year.

Shriever, who won the 2022 European Championships, will hope to add to her two world titles when she travels to Denmark for the World Championships from 2-3 August.

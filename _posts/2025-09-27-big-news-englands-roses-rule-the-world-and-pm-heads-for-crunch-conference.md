According to new developments, "Roses...and Thorns" is the headline in the Observer, which gives the whole of its front page over to a picture of English rugby players celebrating. "England win the World Cup", the papers says, "as Labour head for a scrum" - a reference to the party's conference, which starts today. 

The Sunday Times says Labour has planned what the paper calls a blitz of policy announcements in the conference period to put a rocky few weeks behind it, kicking off with plans for twelve new towns. But it also says Sir Keir Starmer faces a significant challenge if he is to quell growing questions within the party about his competence and leadership. 

The Sunday Telegraph reports that the chancellor is facing a revolt from ministers who are demanding she tear up her fiscal rules to allow more public spending. They are said to be begging Rachel Reeves for additional funding for their departments to fulfill manifesto pledges, amid fears that continued austerity could drive voters into the arms of Reform. And in the Sunday Mirror, the prime minister warns the electorate not to fall for Nigel Farage, whom he calls "grubby". Sir Keir Starmer accuses the Reform leader of being out to line his pockets rather than fix the UK.

A defence expert with the think tank Chatham House tells the Sunday Express that war with Russia is inevitable unless Nato displays what he calls "strength and unity" in the face of growing provocations from Moscow. Keir Giles says Russia would have little to deter it taking on the West, if US protection for Europe becomes less certain.

The defence secretary tells the Sunday Telegraph that British-made drones will be deployed to create what is being called a "drone wall" to protect Nato countries from Russian aggression. John Healey said the UK would mass produce the weapons using techniques Moscow does not have. The drones are being developed in collaboration with Ukraine, and could be stationed for ground-launch on the border to tackle Russian drones or missiles.

The Sunday Times reports that the King has - in its words - "signalled" that Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York will not be welcome at the Royal Family's Christmas celebrations. The paper says that sources close to Charles indicated he would keep them at arms length in the wake of revelations that the duchess had maintained contact with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein after publicly denouncing him in 2011. Friends say she is devastated by any embarrassment caused.

And the Mail on Sunday reports that Prince Harry has lambasted the so-called "men in grey suits" at Buckingham Palace for trying to sabotage his reconciliation with his father. Harry is said to be furious at what he believes are hostile briefings to the press from court aides, to undermine his efforts to strike a rapprochement with the King. Buckingham Palace has not commented.

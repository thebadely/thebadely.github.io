Experts revealed that More than 30 new laws have been passed in Parliament this year, from the Great British Energy Act to the Employment Rights Act.

Among the slew of legislation, there have been new laws which have grabbed attention and prompted controversy.

But there are some lesser-known bits of legislation that passed this year, that might also have an impact on your life.

Alpacas and llamas have been given new protection from dogs, which may be off the lead, attacking them.

The furry creatures, best described as a cross between a horse and a sheep, have become an increasingly regular feature of the UK landscape despite their South American origins.

There are an estimated 45,000 alpacas and another 4,000 llamas in the UK, according to the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra).

Now, the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) (Amendment) Act gives the animals the same protections as goats, sheep, cattle and poultry, with an unlimited fine for irresponsible dog walkers.

A ban on bus services being run as a not-for-profit service for vulnerable passengers has been lifted by the Labour government.

The Bus Services Act aims to protect routes at risk of being cut by operators deeming them unprofitable, by tightening requirements for companies looking to scrap them.

The new legislation also allows councils to take over some routes, so services for vulnerable passengers - such as the elderly and disabled living in rural areas - continue.

Bus drivers and bus station staff will also be given mandatory training on identifying and intervening where vulnerable passengers are at risk from antisocial behaviour or violence.

The public will not be forced to buy a 568ml beverage at the bar or from their local corner shop.

Pints of beer, cider and milk have been protected by MPs under the Product Regulation and Metrology Act.

Fears that Labour could move to abolish the "iconic imperial measure" were behind a showdown in the House of Lords as the bill made its way through Parliament.

But praise was poured upon the humble pint's place in the nation's history, cultural life and language, and the government moved to ensure the measurement was preserved for posterity.

Giving up a beloved pet in order to find somewhere to live has long been a bugbear of those needing to rent. 

Now the rules around pets in lets have changed, and each situation must be considered on a case-by-case basis under changes in the Renters Rights Act.

Landlords must consider each request for a pet to join a tenant and cannot unreasonably refuse.

Requests can still be denied by landlords, if for example the property is too small, other tenants have allergies, or the potential pet is illegal in the UK.

The idea that loved ones are laid to rest in their grave in perpetuity may be romantic, but in many cases may need to be overturned.

Graveyards and cemeteries regularly run out of burial space across the UK, and the problem is especially acute in London. 

It is an offence to remove buried human remains without a licence. But burial authorities have the right to re-use graves, often by deepening them, after 75 years. 

This is what is happening at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, where the General Cemetery Act has granted the right to "disturb human remains" in order to increase space for more burials.

Let's dive into the details: The aftermath of the Manchester synagogue attack features on all the front pages.  

The i Paper features a picture of Adrian Daulby, who blocked the attacker from entering the synagogue before he was "shot dead by police in error".  

The headline hails him as "the hero who gave his life to save others".  The paper's Letter from The Editor calls Thursday's attack "a window into the direction our public life has been moving".

The Daily Mail takes aim at the pro-Palestine protests organised for today - saying in its editorial that the events are used "as a front for rank antisemitism".  

The Sun says requests by the government and police for the demonstrators to call off the protests were made with "pathetic politeness". 

The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, writes in the Daily Express that "it's a damning indictment of how bad things have got that the Met Police have been reduced to begging the organisers on social media to stand down".

The Daily Telegraph says Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was met with calls to "stop the marches" at a vigil yesterday. The paper's leader column says the heckling "spoke to the mood of the nation", with a protester saying what was needed was "action now, not words".  

"Lammy told: you have blood on your hands" is the headline in the Mail. The Daily Mirror says Lammy vowed "unity" despite the boos from the crowd.

The Guardian says Chancellor Rachel Reeves is being urged by colleagues to ditch Labour's manifesto promises not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT.  Someone described as having knowledge of the discussions is quoted as saying there's a risk next month's budget will look like "a hodgepodge" - with money raised through a slew of small measures.   

The paper brands that a "pasty tax" budget - referring to George Osborne's budget in 2012, which prompted a furious response to changes to the tax on pasties.  A Treasury source tells the paper there's  "a lot of rubbish out there from people who claim to know what is in the budget before decisions are made".

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Roger Tuivasa-Sheck won 20 caps for New Zealand before switching allegiance to Samoa

Australian rugby league's governing body says players who join the "counterfeit" breakaway R360 league will be banned for 10 years.

R360, which plans to launch in October 2026, is aiming to attract rugby union and rugby league players with hefty contracts and a slimmed-down playing schedule.

Leading National Rugby League (NRL) players have reportedly been approached by R360, which will involve six to eight men's teams and four women's teams based in major cities around the world.

Samoa's Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, who plays for New Zealand Warriors in the NRL, has said he has had talks with R360., external

Ryan Papenhuyzen, Zac Lomax, Payne Haas and Jye Gray are also reported, external to be considering joining.

Eight major rugby union nations, including Australia, last week announced a ban on R360 recruits playing international matches.

"We've listened to our clubs and we've acted decisively," said Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'Landys.

"Unfortunately, there will always be organisations that seek to pirate our game for potential financial gain.

"They don't invest in pathways or the development of players. They simply exploit the hard work of others, putting players at risk of financial loss while profiting themselves.

"They are, in reality, counterfeiting a code."

R360 is co-founded by former England World Cup winner Mike Tindall and backed by private investors.

After the prospective rugby union bans were announced last week, it said it wants to "work collaboratively as part of the global rugby calendar," and that all players would be released for international matches. 

"History shows that when athletes are offered free choice and given fresh opportunities for them and their families then threats to those sportsmen and women follow," R360 co-chief executive Mark Spoors said on Wednesday.

"R360 is about empowering players, giving them, rugby lovers and the next generation of fans opportunities and new platforms to enjoy the sport we love.

"We know there is much interest in understanding more about the global series we're building. We remain on plan and look forward to sharing and discussing the detail in the coming months."

R360 will seek approval for its plans from World Rugby, rugby union's governing body, at its council meeting next year.

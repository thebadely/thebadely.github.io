It has been recently reported that Stuart Kettlewell is among a number of candidates Kilmarnock are speaking to about the Scottish Premiership club's managerial vacancy.

The Rugby Park outfit have been left hunting for a replacement for Derek McInnes after he opted to join Hearts.

And the 40-year-old Kettlewell, who quit as Motherwell boss in January citing personal abuse during a run of poor results, is reportedly close, external to being appointed as his successor.

However, Kilmarnock chairman Billy Bowie and his fellow directors will hold further interviews before they make an appointment.

Scotland assistant John Carver and former Kilmarnock forward Steven Naismith have also been linked with the post.

Kettlewell resigns as Motherwell boss over fan abuse

In appointing a new manager, Kilmarnock clearly want to avoid any of the complications that surrounded the departure of McInnes.

That all got a bit tricky with the mounting speculation followed by a defeat at Motherwell and the understandable dismay of some fans. 

The decision that McInnes wouldn't be in charge for the final match of the season against his prospective new employers was clearly an exercise in damage limitation.

Kettlewell is not an unexpected name to be linked with the job. He is available and can point to a strong evidence of work at Motherwell and Ross County.

For now, interviews for the vacant post continue, but names of candidates and timeframe are being kept well under wraps.

Jason: Now Dundee have decided to dispense with Tony Docherty's services I'd quite happily see him in the dugout at Rugby Park. He did a good job there and I think he'd be an ideal replacement and it's not too much of a risk. He knows the league and the players in it, so I think it would hopefully be a smooth transition.

John: Either Paul Lambert or David Martindale. I think both managers could improve our style of football, giving better entertainment for the fans. Passing football has been seriously lacking this season and it has been a grim watch.

Jay: Shaun Maloney for Killie - that'd be a great shout.

Gary: Scott Brown with a bigger and better squad than he has at Ayr could do well. Docherty unfairly sacked as Dundee boss. Chris Burke on coaching staff.

Matthew: Robbie Neilson. Average 1.7 points per game, likes to play 3-4-2-1 which allows you to play a more progressive, entertaining football.

Brett: Need someone like Duncan Ferguson to inject a bit of passion into the team.

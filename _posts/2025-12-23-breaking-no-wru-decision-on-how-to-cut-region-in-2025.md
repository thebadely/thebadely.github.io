Here’s what you need to know: WRU chair Richard Collier-Keywood, director of rugby and head of elite performance Dave Reddin and chief executive Abi Tierney outlined a new strategy in October

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) says there will be no resolution before the end of 2025 on how to cut a professional men's side.

Welsh rugby's governing body announced in October it wants to reduce the amount of teams from four to three.

The WRU had hoped to explain how this would happen by Christmas.

In a WRU end-of-year message signed by chief executive Abi Tierney, chair Richard Collier-Keywood and president Terry Cobner, the union said that will now not happen and discussions will continue.

"Our priority remains to reach a consensus with the professional clubs if possible," the WRU said.

"While we had hoped to provide certainty before Christmas, it has become clear that a few more weeks are needed to try and reach an agreed way forward."

So the uncertainty now for players and fans will continue into the new year.

Abject failure becoming the norm - where does Welsh rugby go from here?

WRU Q&A: Why drastic change is needed

The WRU announced in October three licences would be granted - one to a team in Cardiff, one in the west and one in the east.

Negotiations have continued with Ospreys, Scarlets, Cardiff and Dragons but nothing will be resolved on this issue before the end of the year.

If an agreement cannot be reached in January, a six-month tender process could open to determine the successful trio.

It seemed there would be a straight shootout for survival between Scarlets and Ospreys for the west licence before another proposal emerged.

The WRU took over Cardiff in April after the organisation slipped into administration. 

The governing body has since been looking for new investors, with Ospreys owners, Y11 Sports and Media, linked to buying Cardiff, enabling the WRU to get to its magic number of three.

The WRU and Y11 have both declined to comment, fuelling the fears of Ospreys supporters about the survival of their team, while Cardiff fans have been vocal on social media against any such takeover. 

"Work has continued to secure a sustainable long-term future for the Cardiff club and its supporters," said the WRU.

"This is a significant decision and will be taken with the thorough scrutiny and due diligence it deserves."

The WRU also wants control over playing affairs at the surviving three sides while still asking backers to put money into the ventures. 

That issue has also provided a major stumbling block in negotiations and delayed the process.

Culling a men's professional team was part of the WRU strategy launched in October which the governing body accepts has been the most debated part.

The WRU confirmed it was not stepping back from this.

"This is not about abandoning any part of Wales, nor is it about turning our backs on the communities that have supported professional teams for generations," it said. 

"It is about creating a professional game that is sustainable, competitive and capable of supporting the wider rugby ecosystem in the long term.

"Fewer teams means stronger squads, more stable finances and clearer pathways for players progressing from clubs, through Super Rygbi Cymru and into the professional and international game. 

"We know loyalties run deep and that this is an emotional issue. We also know that behind every structure are people who care deeply about their teams."

December has also seen the news Ospreys duo and Wales captains Dewi Lake and Jac Morgan are walking away from Welsh rugby's uncertainty by signing for Gloucester next season.  

More are expected to follow with players facing an uncertain Christmas.

"We understand the disappointment felt when talented Welsh players choose to play their club rugby elsewhere and we have tried to reduce the uncertainty of the current situation," said the WRU.

"We have confirmed to the Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) and our professional clubs that all existing player contracts are guaranteed.

"To minimise the uncertainty for players and to support clubs to offer new contracts with confidence."

The WRU reflected on a tumultuous year where the men's and women's senior sides have suffered record and humiliating defeats.

"This has been a year of hard truths and hard work," the WRU said.

"We have had to confront realities that could no longer be ignored, and we know that doing so has been painful at times. 

"Results in our international game have disappointed us all. The professional game has been under pressure - financially and competitively - and we have had to make some tough decisions to ensure that the future of Welsh rugby is secure."

The governing body says it was making tough decisions to write the previous wrongs of the WRU.

"Proper leadership means acting before circumstances force our hand," the WRU said.

"Over recent decades, Welsh rugby did not invest consistently or effectively enough in its foundations - particularly in the pathways that connect our community clubs, schools and educational establishments to the professional and international game. 

"We must act professionally and make difficult decisions now in order to secure the future of the whole system.

"We are doing this because we believe deeply in what Welsh rugby can be and in what we owe the next generation."

The WRU says it will be spending an extra Â£28m over the next five years that will focus on five factors:

Men's development, including a national academy, two regional training centres and 12 player development centres.

The women's game, with a national academy, development centres and satellites, a new professional competition and investment across the pathway.

Talent insight and management, creating a world-class unit to identify and support Welsh talent wherever it is based.

Coaching, raising standards right across the board at all levels from community, schools and educational establishments through semi-professional to professional.

Super Rygbi Cymru, strengthening the bridge between community and professional rugby.

The WRU insists there are reasons for optimism in 2026, saying: "We have strengthened our financial position, welcomed some outstanding Welsh coaches back home, and continued to invest in the women's and girls' game.

"Welsh rugby will look different in the years ahead. Change can be uncomfortable, and for some, it will be painful. 

"We are focused on building a stable future. Stronger clubs, clearer pathways, professional teams capable of competing and winning, and national teams that once again make this country proud."

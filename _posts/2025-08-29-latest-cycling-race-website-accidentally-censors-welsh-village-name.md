According to new developments, Britain's official cycling body has apologised after accidentally censoring the name of a small Welsh village on its event listing.

Three Cocks, in Powys, hosted two stages of a junior road race last weekend.

But the British Cycling website listed the village as the word Three followed by five asterisks before later correcting the mistake.

A spokesperson said the system decided to inappropriately "spare our blushes" when it automatically censored the name of the village.

The village hosted stages one and two of the national series which took place over the August Bank Holiday weekend.

Stage 1 was a 76km (47.5 miles) sprint circuit on rural roads around the village. The other featured a 10km (6 miles) time trial.

The other stages were held in neighbouring counties including Monmouthshire and Blaenau Gwent.

British Cycling said: "We apologise for this accidental censorship which was caused by some overly sensitive filters on our website.

"Whilst it's great to see this fantastic event getting such national attention, we'll be having a serious look at the new systems we're implementing to ensure that technology doesn't override common sense in future!"

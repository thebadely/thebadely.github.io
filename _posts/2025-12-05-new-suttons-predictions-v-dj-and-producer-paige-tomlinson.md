It has been recently reported that An early candidate for prediction of the season has to be the lone BBC reader who correctly backed Manchester City to beat Fulham 5-4 on Tuesday.

Just under 35,000 of you submitted a score for that game, but only one person went for City to edge a nine-goal thriller.

"That's incredible," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. "Whoever got that right deserves an award. They should be knighted for that, or made a dame.

"Still, the most important predictions were mine - for Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest to both win 1-0 - because those exact scores meant I took the overall victory."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 15, he takes on DJ and producer Paige Tomlinson, who supports Liverpool.

Tomlinson played a number of major festivals in 2025 such as Glastonbury, Creamfields and Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool. Her new single, Listen 2 Me, is out now.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Liverpool-born Tomlinson was inspired to start DJing after she saw a lack of female DJs playing house music in Liverpool clubs

Tomlinson is a lifelong Liverpool fan and says she had no choice in the matter.

"My whole family are Reds, so as soon as I popped out of the womb I was going to be the same," she told BBC Sport. "I am glad I am, too. I wouldn't really want to be a Blue!

"When I was growing up, I was always a huge Fernando Torres fan. I played a lot of football myself, and I played up front, so all through school I kind of fancied myself as a female Torres, really."

Tomlinson still plays regularly now for her five-a-side team, The Liver Birds, and she is still banging in the goals.

"I kind of stopped playing when I got to college and didn't play for a few years, but last summer I started up my own women's team," she explained. 

"We play in a league on Sundays and we are doing really well - we won both of our games last weekend and I think we are top of the league at the moment.

"It's been really good to be part of starting something in the city to get women into playing football. I'm still up front too - once a striker, always a striker! Scoring goals just has a special feeling about it, and I couldn't drop back."

Chris Sutton and Paige Tomlinson were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. 

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Villa Park, 12:30 GMT

Nobody talks about Aston Villa being in the title race, do they? That will change if they win this game.

Villa struggled at the start of the season but now they are on this unbelievable run, and this is a real test for Arsenal.

What was Gunners boss Mikel Arteta doing, leaving Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze out of Wednesday's win over Brentford? They have been the backbone of my Fantasy team this season.

Saka and Eze should be back on Saturday but Arteta has a history of being cautious in big games like this one - look at their draw at Stamford Bridge last week, for example.

A lot of people saw that as a good point and I get why but, as a former player, I know that after playing against 10 men for an hour, I would have come off the pitch feeling disappointed with a draw.

Arteta's mindset is different. This isn't a criticism, because it is working for them, but they are quite pragmatic.

I still think they will win the league, and I still believe they are the strongest team with depth in their squad to cope with the injuries they have got at the moment - but they could still end up looking back on that Chelsea game, or their defeat at Liverpool in August, and wish they had gone for it more.

I don't think they will do that at Villa Park either, and the most likely result is probably another draw, which would be Arsenal's third in a row on the road.

But I don't want to go for a draw because it is the biggest game of the weekend and, in any case, I do have a feeling Arsenal will sneak it for what would be a real statement win.

I am sure Villa will have a real go at them, but Arsenal will nullify them and find a way of getting a goal.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Paige's prediction: As much as I'd love to see Arsenal lose because they are clear at the top at the moment, I feel like they are going to edge this one. They have a few injuries at the moment but it doesn't seem to affect them much. It feels like it is going to be their season, as much as it kills me to say it. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Vitality Stadium, 15:00

I've been backing Bournemouth recently and they have taken one point from their past five games - so maybe I need to return to the times when I said they would lose every week.

Given the Cherries are in such poor form, the obvious thing to say here is that Chelsea will bounce back from their midweek defeat at Leeds.

But I'm not sure what to expect from Enzo Maresca's team. They need a response because they were insipid at Elland Road, when Leeds ran all over them, but if they are that meek again then they are in trouble.

I also think things have to turn for Bournemouth soon, and eventually they will get a break or two.

It's hard to feel confident about either side winning it, though, so let's go with a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Paige's prediction: This is a tough one to call but I am going to go with Chelsea. 1-3

AI's prediction: 0-2

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00

I don't know what kind of reception Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche will get from Everton fans, but I'd like to think it will be a good one - based on how he dealt with the turmoil at the club when he was in charge there.

Given the circumstances at Everton, Dyche did a good job there - and I think he will do a good job at Forest too.

Wednesday's win at Wolves was another good result for him and it already feels like he has steadied the ship at Forest. 

Put it this way, it already feels like they are going to be staying up pretty comfortably, because Dyche will be well aware of the work he has to do.

I don't see Forest getting anything on Saturday, though. It's been impossible to predict how Everton will do in recent weeks, but I have a feeling they will edge a very tight game.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Paige's prediction: I'm backing Everton to win this one at home. 2-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Etihad Stadium, 15:00

I've seen a lot of Manchester City recently - I was at their win over Leeds and also against Fulham - so I've seen a lot of goals at both ends in the past few days.

Usually I'd be pretty confident they would win this one at home, but not so much now.

I could not believe how passive Pep Guardiola's side were in the second half at Craven Cottage when Fulham were fighting back against them. When it went from 5-1 to 5-3, I thought City would assert themselves again, but it just did not happen.

Fulham did not lie down, the same way Leeds did not lie down when they came back from 2-0 to 2-2 at Etihad Stadium last weekend, and we know Sunderland will throw lots at City too.

Sunderland are not just about fight and desire, either. As we saw when they played Liverpool on Wednesday, they are about organisation and carrying a goal threat too.

The Black Cats players were probably sitting in the Anfield dressing room at full-time feeling disappointed, so they will not be approaching this game with any fear whatsoever.

I am still going to go with City here because they usually win at home and Phil Foden appears to be back at his very best, I've really enjoyed what I've seen from him.

But, even if they go 2-0 up, we know the game won't be over. City don't seem capable of killing a game anymore.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Paige's prediction: This should be a good match and anything could happen here. You know what, I am actually going to go for Sunderland to get a draw, because they have had such a good start to the season. City can't help scoring, but they can't stop conceding at the moment either. 2-2

AI's prediction: 4-0

St James' Park, 15:00

Not many predictions seem straightforward anymore, but this one does.

Burnley have lost five games in a row and I don't see things changing here. Their main issue is still that they don't score enough goals, while only Wolves have conceded more than them this season.

I always think Newcastle look so dangerous but they haven't found any consistency this season, as we saw with their draw against Tottenham. Even so, they should be pretty comfortable here.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Paige's prediction: I don't see Burnley causing Newcastle many problems. 2-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00

Brentford were competitive against Arsenal on Wednesday but they have now lost six of their seven away games this season.

That should be good news for Spurs, but right now it is impossible to back them at home. They don't seem to have a functioning front line at the moment, which is why they needed Cristian Romero to pop up at Newcastle with a couple of goals.

Things are not right on the pitch and, off it, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is not a happy place either - the fans are making their feelings pretty clear.

So, wouldn't it be typical for Thomas Frank's former team to go there and nick a result?

It could end up being a war of attrition, because Bees boss Keith Andrews will try to play on the break and I can see his side getting something.

It feels like Frank doesn't just need a win, he needs a kind of statement win and performance, to convince the Spurs fans.

That's unfair because he needs time, but that's something Premier League managers don't get.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Paige's prediction: Frank really needs a win here and I think he will get it. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Elland Road, 17:30

When are Liverpool going to turn the corner? They were fortunate not to lose at home to Sunderland in midweek and they still look fragile.

The way Arne Slot's side are playing, this is going to be another tough game for them. As Chelsea found out on Wednesday, Leeds at home are usually a different animal to Leeds away.

The biggest difference with Daniel Farke's side in the past couple of games, however, has been down to Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He gives them a different dynamic in their attack.

Calvert-Lewin came on at half-time against City and played 86 minutes against Chelsea, and his physical presence up front was a big factor in both games.

I am not sure how Liverpool are going to have to deal with him but my only doubt about Leeds is how much those two games have taken out of them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-2

Paige's prediction: I am going to think quite positively here. It feels like we concede in almost every game at the moment, and Leeds will probably get the first goal and we will have to chase the game to get back into it, but we are beginning to get some confidence back so I think we will do it. 1-3

Paige on Liverpool's season: It's been such a tough start. I feel like we all are genuinely struggling with the loss of Diogo Jota. I think any team would be the same, after losing someone so close to them. 

I think it's been a combination of that and having so many new signings that it's been hard for everyone to gel together, but if we are anything like the Liverpool I know, I feel like we will come back - although it will probably be towards the end of the season when things click and we work out our strengths as a team.

I am still loving what Hugo Ekitike has been doing for us since he joined, though. And I was really pleased to see Alexander Isak get off the mark against West Ham last weekend because there so was so much hype and drama around his signing, and he has taken a few games to get going. 

AI's prediction: 1-2

Amex Stadium, 14:00

West Ham got a big point at Old Trafford on Thursday. They are in a bit of trouble at the bottom of the table and you can see they are scrapping for everything.

They have to, really. Everyone has written Wolves off, for obvious reasons, and it looks like Burnley are slipping out of touch too, but with Leeds winning in midweek it just puts a bit more pressure on the Hammers.

At least it looks like they are moving in the right direction under Nuno Espirito Santo, even if they haven't won in three games.

This is a tough trip for them, though. 

What a game that was between Brighton and Aston Villa on Wednesday. I always think the Seagulls will score goals, but I always expect them to leak a few too.

That was Brighton's first home defeat of the season, but they should bounce back on Sunday.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Paige's prediction: West Ham are a little bit hit and miss at the moment, so I am backing Brighton here. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Craven Cottage, 16:30

I saw nine goals at Craven Cottage on Tuesday but I am not expecting a high-scoring game here.

Crystal Palace don't seem to score or concede that many, and Fulham aren't usually so prolific, either.

I do love a 1-0 to Palace with my predictions but watching Josh King and Samuel Chukwueze tear Manchester City apart in midweek makes me think they can cause Oliver Glasner's side some problems too.

Still, there is no way the Eagles will be as open as City were, so I am in two minds here. 

I was tempted to go for a 1-1 draw, but let's stick with a narrow Palace win.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Paige's prediction: This could be quite boring. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Molineux, 20:00

The Rob Edwards bounce hasn't happened at Wolves and it's no surprise, either. They are still the same group of players who struggled under Vitor Pereira.

I cannot get a Manchester United result right this season, but surely that changes this week, because they have to win this game.

I thought they would have too much firepower for West Ham on Thursday, but that was not the case.

One positive for Ruben Amorim is that I don't ever feel like they are going to concede a load of goals, but they are still not very convincing whoever they play against.

This should be a different story, which is why I am backing them to win - but I wouldn't actually be that surprised if they went to Molineux and ended up getting another 1-1 draw.

Wolves haven't even managed a goal, let alone a point, for five games, which probably means they are due to score but I am going with United to keep a clean sheet too.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Paige's prediction: I'd love Wolves to win this, but I don't think they will. 0-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Chris got four correct results from the 10 midweek games in week 14, but those two exact scores gave him a winning total of 100 points.

The BBC readers and AI both got four correct results, including one exact score, to end up on 70.

Chris's guest, musician and author Felix White, got more correct results than anyone - five - but again with only only one exact score, leaving him with 80 points.

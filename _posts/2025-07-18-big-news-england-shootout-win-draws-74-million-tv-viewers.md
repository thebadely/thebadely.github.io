Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England will face Italy in the semi-finals after beating Sweden 3-2 on penalties

More than seven million viewers tuned in to BBC TV coverage as England beat Sweden in a penalty shootout in Thursday's Euro 2025 quarter-final.

The match received the biggest TV audience of the competition to date, with a peak audience of 7.4 million and a peak audience share of 65%.

It also generated nearly three million online streams across BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website, while there were 8.3m views on the website's live text page.

The Lionesses, defending their European title, fought back from 2-0 down to force extra time and penalties in Zurich thanks to second-half goals from Lucy Bronze and Michelle Agyemang.

England then won a chaotic penalty shootout 3-2, with Bronze, their seventh penalty taker, converting decisively before Sweden missed and were eliminated.

The result for England sets up a semi-final meeting with Italy in Geneva on Tuesday, 22 July.

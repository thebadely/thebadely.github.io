It has been recently reported that Liam Farrell (centre) scored Wigan's winning try in his 350th Super League appearance for the club

Captain Liam Farrell scored a 77th-minute try as Wigan Warriors left it late to claim a hard-fought victory over Castleford Tigers and narrow the gap on Super League leaders Hull KR to four points.

Will Tate's try with seven minutes to go had put the Tigers 20-18 up to leave the Warriors looking at back-to-back defeats.

But an Adam Keighran penalty brought the scores level and then Farrell was on hand to finish after Jai Field had burst through the Cas defence.

Tries from Field and Keighran had given the Warriors an eight-point half-time advantage, but 10th-placed Castleford roared back.

After Tate's first-half score, Daejarn Asi and Sam Wood turned things in their favour only for Zach Eckersley to put Wigan back in front before the late drama.

The Warriors were stunned by Wakefield Trinity eight days ago, while another win for rampant league leaders Hull KR on Friday had extended their advantage to six points at the top ahead of this match.

While there was further bad news just before kick-off as prolific winger Liam Marshall was injured in the warm-up with his place taken by Jacob Douglas.

Castleford had failed to register a point when Hull KR visited the Mend-a-Hose Jungle nine days before, but they only needed 15 minutes to get on the board here as Daejarn Asi's fine cut-out pass sent Tate in at the corner.

But Wigan showed their class to respond immediately as Eckersley's crisp pass allowed Field to mark his 100th game for the club with yet another try â his 18th in Super League this season.

They had passed up a couple of opportunities with uncharacteristically poor handling, but Keighran extended the lead right on half-time.

From a scrum in midfield, Harry Smith released his onrushing centre, who slipped through some poor Tigers defending to race over.

However, Castleford came flying out of the blocks in the second period as Asi sold a huge dummy to Junior Nsemba to score with the Tigers making it a two-point game.

Last season's quadruple winners looked set to restore their lead but Smith's pass was intercepted by Tate, who set off on a run for a move which eventually ended with Wood crossing to put the Yorkshire side ahead.

The home side were unhappy when Wigan launched a captain's challenge after Smith was adjudged to have blocked Josh Simm, and the decision was overturned in favour of the visitors.

Matt Peet's side eventually exploited being back in possession when a sharp long pass from Field was smartly finished by Eckersley, with Keighran's goal putting Wigan back in front.

Tate put Castleford ahead again as he dived in at the corner and had the home fans dreaming of a famous scalp and just a fifth win in 16 games this season, but they were then reminded of one of the game's harshest lessons â never count out the Warriors.

After a high shot by Liam Horne on Jack Farrimond, Wigan played smart to take an easy two points from Keighran's boot to level the scores, and then Field's brilliance set up Farrell for his dramatic winning try.

Castleford Tigers head coach Danny McGuire said:

"I'm obviously really disappointed with the result but really proud of some of the things that we did.

"We probably lost the moments, and the last play of the game is probably one of those moments, and that's probably why Jai Field gets paid the big bucks as he was able to drag a really good team out of a bit of a hole.

"I'm proud of the players and the way they went about things. They worked hard, they put their bodies in front against a big pack and they all cracked on with it.

"It's a good sign for us moving forward."

Wigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It ebbed and flowed. At times, I thought we were going to get beaten, some things of our own design and some things Castleford did well.

"We never got a full grip of the game, but in the end, we came on strong. It was about getting the game going set for set and we managed to do that towards the end.

"Castleford were unfortunate losers but we had some big plays from big players. We'll take the two points and move on."

Let's dive into the details: Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has scored five tries in his eight England appearances

England winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso could be fit for the summer international tours, says Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter.

The 22-year-old has not played this year after dislocating his shoulder in late December, with delays to his surgery following as England and Exeter discussed his treatment. 

Baxter says Feyi-Waboso, who scored a try in each of England's three tour matches last summer in Japan and New Zealand, is "touch and go" to make Chiefs' final match of the season against Sale on 31 May. 

It means he is likely to be fully fit, although he will have had very little game time, should either the British and Irish Lions or England opt to call him up for summer tours.

The Lions go to Australia while England will travel to Argentina for a three-Test tour.

"Manny's in that almost fortunate position, he's almost in a no-lose situation," Baxter said. 

"He could get back, be up and running, be fit and fresh and perhaps be someone who England might want to take on tour if he's completely up and running and ready to go.

"I helped coach on an England tour many moons ago and players were leaving us in Argentina every five minutes to join the Lions, every time there was an injury, every time something changed, so you never know, do you?

"But at the same time, if he had the summer off and he had a full pre-season for us, he'd also benefit from that.

"He's one of those guys that's kind of in a fortunate position where whatever happens he's probably going to go OK."

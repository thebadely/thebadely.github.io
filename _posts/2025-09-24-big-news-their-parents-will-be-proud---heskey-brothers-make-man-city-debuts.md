Experts revealed that Brothers Reigan and Jaden Heskey made their debuts for City at Huddersfield

When the travelling Manchester City fans at Huddersfield sang the names of Yaya and Kolo Toure among their usual repertoire of songs for former players, they might not have expected to see another set of brothers step onto the pitch in Yorkshire not long after.

However, after Pep Guardiola's side went 2-0 up against their League One hosts in the Carabao Cup, the manager turned to his bench and beckoned forward brothers Reigan and Jaden Heskey, who are the sons of ex-England striker Emile.

After being given their instructions from a bench which included Kolo Toure, now part of City's backroom staff, and 10 years on from dad Emile's last EFL Cup appearance, fans got to witness his sons making their first-team debuts for the club.

"Today, six players from the academy made the starting XI," said Guardiola. 

"Two more came on, the Heskey brothers. I think their father and mother will be so proud of their kids. That's really cool."

Reigan is described on the City website as a "tricky, clinical winger" and at 17 is the younger of the brothers, with Jaden two years older and seen as a "mature, hard-working" box-to-box midfielder.

Both are regulars in City's academy teams, with Jaden often wearing the captain's armband in the club's Premier League 2 matches. In 2024, he scored as City beat Leeds 4-0 to lift the FA Youth Cup.

"They're similar to me," Heskey told the Mail, external in August. "They are both very athletic.

"The young one is very quick. The older one is a bit of a beast like I was.

"They've both got similar attributes."

Against Huddersfield, Jaden got 14 minutes, replacing fellow academy graduate Nico O'Reilly, with Reigan coming on for Savinho shortly after.

Phil Foden has scored twice and provided two assists in five games this season

Earlier, it was Phil Foden, perhaps City's most decorated youth graduate of recent years, who once again caught the eye.

The midfielder said last season his struggles were down to off-field issues and carrying an injury, which saw him go on a run of 20 games without scoring.

But the 25-year-old looks like he is approaching the form that saw him collect the Player of the Season and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards in 2024.

In five games this season, Foden has scored two goals and provided two further assists, playing a starring role in Wednesday's win at Accu Stadium.

Guardiola said: "We have seen already Phil in the last few games against Arsenal, Napoli and [Manchester] United, he was really good. 

"When the team plays better every player makes his potential but it's not just today.

"He can play in the pockets perfectly but when he plays a little bit free, he gives you something unique."

Though this was League One opposition, Foden looked a class above anyone else on the pitch.

The goal he scored against the Terriers had the trademarks of a player that was full of confidence, exchanging passes with another debutant in Divine Mukasa and drilling in an unerring finish.

The 25-year-old was playing his fourth games in 11 days and determined to showcase his talents, conducting the play by spraying the ball around to team-mates.

He showed excellent awareness to lay the ball off for Savinho to smash home the second and secure a passage into the fourth round of the competition, where City will travel to Championship side Swansea.

"Phil Foden was instrumental in everything Manchester City did," former England international Sue Smith said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It's great to see him back and playing at this level. Last season was difficult for him with injuries and other things but when he's at his best he's unstoppable."

Teammate Rico Lewis told BBC Radio 5 Live that Foden's happiness is contributing to his success on the pitch.

"Everyone has seen in previous years how good a player he is," Lewis said. "The main thing is he has his confidence back and the goals come with that.

"He just needs to carry on doing what he's doing, most importantly being happy because when he is happy he's doing well."

City host Burnley on Saturday followed by trips to Monaco and Brentford before the international break and Foden will be hoping to impress further to try and earn a recall into Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.

Foden has 45 caps for the Three Lions, with the last of those coming in March against Latvia.

Meanwhile, there was also a return to the team for forgotten England midfielder Kalvin Phillips, who was appearing in a City shirt for the first time since 19 December 2023 at the Club World Cup, which Guardiola called a "good moment".

Phillips travelled up to Huddersfield from London on Wednesday after becoming a father for the second time to son Ari.

Both Heskey brothers and Phillips will be eyeing up further minutes when City head to Swansea in the next round.

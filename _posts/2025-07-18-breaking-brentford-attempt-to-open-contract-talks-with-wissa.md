According to new developments, Wissa has 12 months remaining on his current Brentford deal

Brentford have attempted to open contract talks with Yoane Wissa but he is understood to prefer a move away from the club this summer.

With Bryan Mbeumo expected to join Manchester United, the Bees' attentions are turning to resolving the future of 20-goal forward Wissa.

Newcastle, Tottenham and Nottingham Forest are among those with a firm interest in the DR Congo international.

Brentford have tried to pre-empt the developing issue by starting contract talks with the 28-year-old, who moved to west London in 2021 from French club Lorient.

However, sources have indicated that, as things stand, Wissa has no inclination to discuss improved terms and privately has made his intentions to explore options elsewhere clear.

All three interested clubs can offer him European football next season and it is understood agreeing personal terms, particularly with either Tottenham or Newcastle, will not be an issue.

With that in mind, Brentford's valuation of Wissa is emerging as a factor in his future.

Brentford have no intention of losing both Mbeumo and Wissa this summer but, in reality, with Wissa turning 29 in September, the scenario of a depreciating asset â who this summer could command a fee in the region of Â£40m, if not more - will likely be a consideration.

That he has just 12 months left on his current deal, though there is an option to activate by a further year, is another factor to mull over.

For all parties, there appears merit to finding a resolution â whether a sale or a contract renewal â sooner rather later.

It has been a summer of upheaval at the Gtech Community Stadium - manager Thomas Frank joined Spurs, goalkeeper Mark Flekken was sold to Bayer Leverkusen, captain Christian Norgaard has left for Arsenal and now star forward Mbeumo is set for a move to Old Trafford.

Brentford have already started the process of replenishing their forward options with an unsuccessful Â£35m offer made to Ipswich for attacker Omari Hutchinson.

They also extensively watched Bournemouth forward Dango Ouattara last season.

No matter how Wissa's future develops, it will be a challenging start for new boss Keith Andrews who is preparing for his first season as a manager at any level of professional football.

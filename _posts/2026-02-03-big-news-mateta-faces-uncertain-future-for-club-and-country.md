Here’s what you need to know: Jean-Philippe Mateta joined Crystal Palace on a permanent basis in 2022

Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta finds himself in a difficult position as he no doubt considers what's next after a dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical.

Palace manager Oliver Glasner has spoken publicly about Mateta's issues with a knee injury in recent weeks.

And that niggle may explain the striker's poor form; he has scored just once since the start of December.

The ailment, however, didn't prevent the player from trying to force a move away from Selhurst Park during the final days of the January transfer window.

But with Mateta now stuck at Palace after two rounds of medical tests spooked Milan officials enough to pull out of a deal worth Â£30m, his mind will turn to the immediate future.

Sources have indicated to BBC Sport that Palace were up front with Milan over Mateta's knee issues, sending the Italian club full medical reports towards the end of last week in preparation for a deal being concluded.

But, according to sources in Italy, Milan's reservations were over Mateta's right knee. The 28-year-old's meniscus had ruptured in 2019 when playing for Mainz and he underwent surgery that kept him out for around six months.

In their two examinations of Mateta, the Serie A club came to the conclusion that the striker would likely require an operation to cure the problem, described as an 'inflammation' of the knee.

It is Milan's view that the issue cannot resolved by therapy and load management.

The prospect of surgery does appear the common sense approach here.

It will allow the player to continue his career free of the pain he has struggled with in recent weeks. Likewise, it would help ease any concerns his future suitors may have over his fitness ahead of any move away from Selhurst Park.

It would also suit Palace to a point as it would likely eradicate the possibility of his current knee problems arising as an obstacle towards any future sale.

Mateta's current deal expires in 2027 when Palace would lose him for nothing, so the prospect of selling the player this summer will certainly be considered.

But with the chance of playing in his first World Cup looming large, any surgery for Mateta may have implications towards his selection for the tournament.

Depending on the timescale of recovery and rehabilitation, an operation would eat into the time Mateta has to convince France manager Didier Deschamps that he is worthy of a place for Les Bleus this summer.

The club record signing of Jorgen Strand Larsen will also impact Mateta's first-team opportunities between now and the summer, too, given the Â£48m outlay.

Mateta has scored two goals in three matches for France since his debut last year. Fulfilling his World Cup ambition is within reach but he is facing having limited minutes on the pitch for the remainder of the season as he looks to reinforce his international case.

And that's the quandary that faces Mateta as he contends with the aftermath of his failed move to the San Siro.

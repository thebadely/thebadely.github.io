It has been recently reported that Josh Ioane (Connacht), Harry Byrne (Leinster), Alex Nankivell (Munster) and Rob Baloucoune (Ulster) are all expected to feature this weekend

After its annual autumnal pause, the United Rugby Championship returns this week with all four Irish provinces in action for the first time in five weeks. 

With European campaigns also getting under way in early December, it is a busy period of the season with 10 consecutive weekends of games until the Six Nations takes centre stage in February. 

BBC Sport NI looks at the state of play in Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster before this weekend's games. 

Next five fixtures: Sharks (H), Ospreys (A, Challenge Cup), Black Lion (H, Challenge Cup), Dragons (A), Ulster (A)

It has been a difficult start to life in Galway for former England boss Stuart Lancaster, who replaced Pete Wilkins as Connacht head coach in the summer.

After an opening win over Benetton was followed by the Storm Amy-enforced postponement of their Scarlets game, the western province lost to Cardiff, Bulls and Munster before the international break.

The 28-27 loss to the Bulls in Galway and 17-15 reverse to Munster in Limerick were tough pills to swallow, but Lancaster has had a solid month to devise a plan for breathing new life into Connacht's season. 

It starts with the visit of the Sharks to Dexcom Stadium on Saturday (19:45 GMT). After three defeats in their first four games, the South African side signed off before the November break with a 29-19 win over Scarlets. 

The Sharks will be without most of their Springboks, including Siya Kolisi, Eben Etzebeth, Bongi Mbonambi, Ethan Hooker and Andre Esterhuizen. 

For the hosts, Ireland internationals Bundee Aki, Cian Prendergast and Finlay Bealham are available for selection, but Mack Hansen has been ruled out. 

Hansen, who starred at full-back in Ireland's win over Australia earlier this month, is nursing hand and foot injuries with Connacht unsure on a timeline for the 27-year-old's return. 

After facing the Sharks, Lancaster will lead Connacht into European action for the first time as the Challenge Cup returns with a trip to Ospreys followed by a home game against Georgian side Black Lion. 

New Zealand centre Rieko Ioane is hoping to win Leinster fans over after his spat with club legend Johnny Sexton

Next five fixtures: Dragons (A), Harlequins (H, Champions Cup), Leicester (A, Champions Cup), Ulster (H), Munster (A)

Perhaps the big Leinster push is upon us. After a stuttering start to the season that yielded defeats by the Stormers, Bulls and Munster, the URC holders are tasked with reversing their fortunes with another Investec Champions Cup campaign beckoning. 

And a growing injury list is not what Leo Cullen needed before Friday's contest with the Dragons at Rodney Parade (19:45 GMT). 

Already without scrum-half Cormac Foley and Ireland full-back Hugo Keenan, Leinster confirmed long-term injuries for Ryan Baird and Jamie Osborne earlier this week, both of whom are doubts for the start of the Six Nations. 

James Culhane is also out "for the next few months" with a knee issue while Will Connors is recovering from an arm injury, while Tommy O'Brien and Robbie Henshaw are also currently out. 

Joe McCarthy looks set to be fit next week's Champions Cup opener against Harlequins, which will be the lock's first action of the season. 

And there is naturally a great deal of intrigue over Rieko Ioane's arrival. The hugely experienced All Blacks star has joined the province until the end of the season and hopes to replicate his fellow countryman Jordie Barrett's impact for the Blues during the 2024-25 campaign.

It is an unexpected new chapter for Ioane, who cemented himself as one of the most unpopular figures in Irish rugby after clashing with Johnny Sexton.

If he can go one better than Barrett and propel Leinster to their first Champions Cup title since 2018, it would complete a remarkable turnaround for the two-time World Rugby Player of the Year nominee. 

Next five fixtures: Stormers (H), Bath (A, Champions Cup), Gloucester (H, Champions Cup), Ospreys (A), Leinster (H)

The international break came at a bad time for Clayton McMillan. 

Having started his reign with five wins - highlighted by an impressive dismantling of Leinster at Croke Park - the New Zealander must now ensure his side's early-season momentum has not been disrupted by the Test window.

Across five URC wins and a victory over Argentina XV, McMillan has used 47 players, and his hand has been strengthened this week, with Thaakir Abrahams, Diarmuid Barron, Conor Bartley, Mike Haley, John Hodnett, Alex Kendellen and Niall Scannell all returning to training.

Highly-rated second row Edwin Edogbo is also nearing a return from a head injury, while former Leinster prop Michael Ala'alatoa will join from Clermont in December until the end of the season. 

Munster will aim to make it six from six when they host pacesetters Stormers at Thomond Park in a top-two encounter on Saturday (17:30 GMT) before beginning their Champions Cup campaign away to Bath on 6 December.

While the Stormers will be without their South Africa internationals - including Damian Willemse and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu - a win against a side who already have a points difference of +118 would be another eye-catching statement of intent from Munster.

Ulster-bound prop Angus Bell started all four of Australia's November Tests

Next five fixtures: Benetton (H), Racing 92 (H, Challenge Cup), Cardiff (A, Challenge Cup), Leinster (A), Connacht (A)

Having opened their season with three straight wins, Ulster's bubble was burst before the break by the Lions, who won 49-31 at Ellis Park to give Richie Murphy plenty to ponder during November.

Ulster return to action against Benetton on Friday (19:45 GMT) - their first home game since 11 October - with a lengthy injury list. 

Ireland centre Stuart McCloskey is out with a groin injury, joining Lorcan McLoughlin (elbow), Sean Reffell (shoulder), Ben Moxham (knee), Ethan McIlroy (knee), Eric O'Sullivan (hamstring) and James McNabney (knee) on the sidelines. 

Ben Carson and in-form full-back Michael Lowry will also miss the match against Benetton, who beat Ulster 34-19 in Treviso last season. 

Like Leinster, Ulster are hoping to be boosted by a high-profile southern hemisphere arrival in the form of Angus Bell. 

The Australia prop - who Ulster have signed until the end of the season - will link up with the squad next week. While the Wallabies struggled in November, Bell was one of their standout performers, scoring tries against Italy and France.

A victory over Benetton would keep Ulster in the upper echelons of the URC standings and give them a well-timed spring in their step before a mouthwatering Challenge Cup opener against Racing, who lost 31-15 on their last visit to Belfast in December 2023.

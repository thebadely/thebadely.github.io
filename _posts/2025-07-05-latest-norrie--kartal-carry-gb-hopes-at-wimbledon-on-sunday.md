Cameron Norrie and Sonay Kartal are the remaining British hopes of Wimbledon singles success in 2025 and both players are in fourth-round action at SW19 on Sunday.

Norrie, 29, takes on Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in the second match on Court One, with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz a potential opponent in the last eight.

Kartal, 23, is enjoying her best ever run at a Grand Slam and will meet Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first match on Centre Court (13:30 BST).

Elsewhere in the women's draw, world number one Aryna Sabalenka - who defeated Britain's Emma Raducanu in an enthralling third-round match on Friday - will aim to move a step closer to her first Wimbledon singles title.

Shot variation key to success for Norrie

World number 61 Norrie, making his eighth appearance at Wimbledon, is through to round four for only the second time.

He was a semi-finalist in 2022, losing to eventual champion Novak Djokovic.

Norrie's opponent Jarry has been as high as 16th in the world but is currently outside the top 100 having been affected by health concerns for several months.

He won three qualifying matches to reach the main draw, before defeating eighth seed Holger Rune and teenage sensation Joao Fonseca on his way through to the last 16.

Britain's Salisbury and Skupski reach third round

Kartal, who is set to climb to a career-high ranking as a result of her singles run at the All England Club, has her sights on a first Grand Slam quarter-final.

The experienced Pavlyuchenkova, 34, was French Open runner-up in 2021 but has only once made it this far at Wimbledon since her 2007 debut.

Kartal, the world number 51, is ranked one place below her Russian opponent.

British interest also continues in the doubles and junior events.

Joe Salisbury and Brazilian partner Luisa Stefani play Argentine Andres Molteni and American Asia Muhammad in the mixed doubles second round.

Also in that competition, the all-British pair of David Stevenson and Maia Lumsden face eighth seeds Mate Pavic and Timea Babos of Croatia and Hungary respectively, while former champions Neal Skupski and American Desirae Krawczyk are up against American-Russian pair Nathaniel Lammons and Alexandra Panova.

Seventeen-year-old Mimi Xu, who lost to Raducanu in the women's first round on Monday, begins her girls' singles campaign against American Thea Frodin first on court 12.

How did Kartal make adjustments to secure third-round win?

Second seed Alcaraz has had far from a smooth ride through to the last 16, being taken to five sets by Fabio Fognini in round one and four sets by Jan-Lennard Struff in his most recent outing.

The Spaniard, chasing a third successive Wimbledon title, plays Russian 14th seed and former quarter-finalist Andrey Rublev in the third match on Centre Court.

First up on Court One (13:00 BST) is fifth seed Taylor Fritz, who has been on court for almost 10 hours and has played a total of 14 sets across his first three matches. 

The American takes on world number 44 Jordan Thompson of Australia, who has matched his career-best run at a Grand Slam.

The winner of that one will play either Karen Khachanov or Kamil Majchrzak in the last eight - they open proceedings on court two at 11:00 BST.

Sabalenka is an imposing presence in the top half of the women's draw, even more so after a host of leading seeds went out early in the tournament.

The 27-year-old Belarusian will take on 24th seed Elise Mertens of Belgium, once Kartal's match has been completed on Centre Court.

Awaiting the victor in the quarter-finals will be either Solana Sierra of Argentina, who lost in qualifying but made it into the main draw as a lucky loser, or unseeded 37-year-old German Laura Siegemund.

Two seeds meet in the only other women's singles match scheduled for Sunday as American world number 12 Amanda Anisimova takes on Czech player Linda Noskova, ranked 15 places lower, last on Court One.

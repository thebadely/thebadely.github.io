Here’s what you need to know: Ruben Dias and Nico O'Reilly both started the FA Cup final last season, in which Manchester City were beaten by Crystal Palace

Manchester City have reached agreements in principle over new contracts with defender Ruben Dias and midfielder Nico O'Reilly.

Portugal international Dias' current deal expires in 2027, while academy product O'Reilly's contract runs until 2028.

Sources have not revealed the length of the new contracts.

Dias, 28, joined City from Benfica for Â£65m in 2020 and has made 222 appearances for the club, winning four Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.

City's injury crisis last season allowed 20-year-old O'Reilly to break through into the first team, with the majority of his 21 appearances coming at the unfamiliar position of left-back.

The City players returned to training on 28 July following their shock exit from the Club World Cup in the United States.

City have signed five players this summer and are expecting departures from their squad before the end of the transfer window on 1 September.

Midfielder Jack Grealish was left out of the squad for the tournament and, during that period, he had been working individually at City's training ground.

The club invited supporters to watch an open training session on Tuesday and Grealish was part of the group that were being put through their paces.

The 29-year-old is said to be of interest to Everton but sources say City are yet to receive any offers for the England international.

Midfielder Kalvin Phillips lost his number four shirt to new signing Tijjani Reijnders is another who is likely to depart but is currently recuperating from Achilles surgery.

Sources have told BBC Sport that clubs in the Premier League including Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, as well as in the Bundesliga, are interested in signing midfielder James McAtee.

The arrival of James Trafford from Burnley means City have four senior goalkeepers so Stefan Ortega is the most likely to depart, should any offers come in for the 32-year-old German.

Meanwhile, Ballon d'Or winner Rodri took full part in the training session and appears to be fit for the Premier League season-opener at Wolves on 16 August.

The Spaniard missed almost all of last season with a serious knee injury and was substituted in the extra-time defeat by Al-Hilal in the US, with manager Pep Guardiola saying afterwards the player "complained about his situation".

Brazilian centre-back Vitor Reis was not involved as he closes in on a season-long loan move to La Liga side Girona.

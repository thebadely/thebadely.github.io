Watch Harvey Barnes fire Newcastle to victory against Manchester City

Of course, Harvey Barnes had to be the match winner for Newcastle United in their 2-1 Premier League win over Manchester City amid a polarising debate about the attacker being called up for Scotland.

The 27-year-old, who is eligible to play for Scotland through his grandparents, netted twice for Eddie Howe's men at St James' Park as they edged out Pep Guardiola's side in a thrilling Saturday night victory.

Will that performance have swayed any Scotland fans sitting on the fence? Or perhaps it has flipped opinions entirely?

Here, BBC Scotland looks at the state of play, the mood among the Tartan Army and what Barnes could bring to Steve Clarke's team.

In the immediate aftermath of Barnes' match-winning display against City, he was on post-match media duties.

What unfolded was an awkward but lighthearted chat as former England duo Micah Richards and Jamie Redknapp pressed him on a potential switch to Scotland.

"Can we expect you at the World Cup for Scotland?" asked Richards from the Sky Sports studio. 

Laughing and with a smile on his face, Barnes mimicked that his headphones had cut out.

The winger did not get away with that, with presenter David Jones following up by asking if his performance was a "come and get me plea" for Clarke.

Barnes' response was one you would expect from one of today's media savvy footballers.

"That obviously isn't on my mind at the minute," he replied. "There's a long way to go until the summer."

Former City defender Richards went back in for more: "So it's not a no, then?".

"Harvey McBarnes, that's got a ring to it," added ex-Liverpool midfielder Redknapp.

It was banter that would have some toes curling, but the Newcastle winger's refusal to rule himself out was enough to grab attention.

Watch Scotland secure World Cup place with incredible 4-2 win over Denmark

It was a similar response from Barnes when he was asked by a reporter earlier in the week.

While the Scotland squad were still nursing a hangover from last Tuesday's historic 4-2 win over Denmark, a clip emerged of the former Leicester City man saying a switch was not closed off.

The timing felt interesting, which is part of the problem for Scotland fans.

Many feel Barnes does not deserve to just show up to a World Cup after a committed squad have put in all the hard graft beforehand.

There was a similar debate when Che Adams, a former England youth international who is also eligible to play for Scotland through a grandparent, was brought into the squad three months before the delayed Euro 2020 finals.

As ever with these things, all is forgotten after a goal is scored, but the fact Barnes has been capped by England perhaps makes things a bit more tribal.

That cap came in 2020 as a substitute in a win against Wales, but he is still eligible for Scotland because that appearance for the Auld Enemy was in a friendly.

It seems Clarke has already asked the question, too. That is another bee in the bonnet of some fans.

Two years ago, reports claimed Barnes was considering switching his allegiance to Scotland. Clarke then revealed he had spoken to the winger.

Nothing materialised. "The next phone call won't be from me," the head coach said, external.

Whether Clarke has softened his stance, or Barnes is prepared to make the next move, remains to be seen.

What is clear, though, is the potential inclusion of Barnes to elevate Scotland's attacking options.

This is a Champions League player who is performing in a domestic division many perceive as the world's most challenging.

Barnes' double against City on Saturday took his tally for the season to six in 18 games. Three of them have come in four Champions League matches.

Since the start of last season, he has 15 goals and seven assists in all competitions from the wing.

There is simply no other Scotland forward providing this level of output at this level for their club.

On Saturday, Barnes could have had a goal or two to his name by the time he drilled in a deadly opener, which showcased his direct running and ability to link up.

His second, which proved to be the winner, demonstrated a poacher's instinct, adjusting his body at close range to take an excellent first touch before burying on the rebound.

Scotland have long lacked real pace, drive and quality in their attacking areas, even after the emergence of Ben Gannon-Doak, who has been a revelation for Clarke.

That became clear when the Bournemouth winger was taken off on a stretcher in the first half of the incredible victory over the Danes last week. He has since had surgery on a hamstring injury and faces months out.

Without the 20-year-old, Clarke's side became predictable in open play and had no out ball during periods of relentless Denmark pressure.

Barnes would be a big help in addressing that. The prospect of him playing off his favoured left side with Doak on the opposite flank is certainly an exciting one.

However, it seems some pride will have to be swallowed for that to become a well-received reality.

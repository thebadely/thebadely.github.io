It has been recently reported that Jamie Overton played one Test for England, making 97 against New Zealand in 2022

England have added fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to their squad for the decisive fifth Test against India at The Oval.

Overton provides cover and depth to a pace attack that was left exhausted by the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

England spent 143 overs in the field across the final two days as India earned a draw in Manchester and captain Ben Stokes said his side could need "fresh legs" for the series finale.

Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse have featured in all four Tests in the series, while Jofra Archer has played in two since making his comeback from a four-year injury absence.

Stokes himself struggled with various injuries during the fourth Test but said it would be "very unlikely" he will miss out at The Oval, where England need to avoid defeat in order to win the series.

There is a tight turnaround between Tests. England were still on the field in Manchester late on Sunday evening, and the final match begins on Thursday.

Overton, who won his only Test cap in 2022, joins Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue as the other pace bowlers in the England squad.

It is not out of the question that all three will be required to come into the XI for the final Test.

Even then, there would be an unknown element attached to Surrey pair Overton and Atkinson in particular.

Overton, 31, has played only one first-class match since May, partly because he suffered an injured finger playing for England in a one-day international against West Indies in the same month.

Atkinson enjoyed a stellar debut year in Test cricket in 2024, claiming 52 wickets, but has endured a frustrating summer.

The 27-year-old injured his hamstring in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe and has now not played any first-class cricket in more than two months.

Atkinson played an amateur game for club side Spencer two weeks ago and had a fitness examination at Old Trafford two days before the fourth Test.

England deemed him to be too much of a risk, so he was released to Surrey, for whom he played in the second XI last week.

Tongue, 27, played in the first two Tests of the series against India, taking 11 wickets.

He has remained in the England squad throughout, then was released last week to play in the final two days of Nottinghamshire's County Championship match at Hampshire.

Here’s what you need to know: Mica Moore went to the 2018 Winter Olympics with Team GB after crowdfunding more than Â£40,000 to help get to the Games

Former Great Britain bobsleigher and track athlete Mica Moore will compete at next month's Winter Olympics for Jamaica.

The 32-year-old from Newport in south Wales has qualified for the Milan-Cortina Games in the monobob.

Moore achieved Britain's best result in women's bobsleigh when she and Mica McNeill finished eighth at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.

The former Commonwealth Games track sprinter received Jamaican citizenship in December 2024.

"I can't believe it, four years ago I watched from the side lines all my fabulous friends from around the world announce they were going to Games, but four years later I've booked my seat at the party," Moore said on social media.

"This is my greatest honour of my career to represent my heritage of Jamaica at the Olympics, a moment I have only dreamt of! I hope I can make you all proud!"

Moore 'won't get sick of Cool Runnings references'

Moore's grandfather, Venson Byfield, came to the UK in the Windrush generation and settled in Wales.

She began her sporting career as an athlete - representing Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games - before switching to bobsleigh.

Moore left the British winter sports programme in 2022 after claiming she had witnessed "damaging and offensive behaviour".

After a three-year break she returned to the ice competing for Jamaica at the Europe Cup in Lillehammer in January 2025.

"The journey was never going to be easy," added Moore in her Instagram post., external

"This is the biggest message to myself to never ever give up.

"To keep going even when hurting. To keep going when tired. To keep going when others try to halt you. To keep going even when times are happy."

Jamaica's bobsleigh team - made famous by the 1993 comedy film Cool Runnings - will have two other crews in Milan-Cortina, also qualifying for the four-man and two-man events.

The XXV Winter Olympic Games in northern Italy run from Friday, 6 to Sunday,  22 February.

The BBC will be broadcasting more than 450 hours of live action from the Games.

Let's dive into the details: Cieran Slicker flashed a quick smile at head coach Steve Clarke as he bounded on to the Hampden pitch six minutes and 37 seconds into Scotland's friendly with Iceland to replace stricken starter Angus Gunn.

Just 64 seconds later, the debutant took a panicked slash at a Kieran Tierney pass back and the ball eventually found its way to Andri Gudjohnsen, who arced a fine finish high over the stranded goalkeeper.

The smile was gone. The misery was just beginning. The next hour of Scotland's 3-1 defeat by Iceland might be among the worst Slicker will endure in his career.

Slicker endures horror debut - but who is Scotland's seventh-choice keeper?

Abject Scotland booed off after woeful defeat by Iceland

Scotland must get it right quickly - Robertson

Slicker didn't really have any time to acclimatise to international football.

One mistake - and a relatively small one at that - one goal. Bang.

His confidence was visibly shaken and he rushed his next couple of kicks before unconvincingly clinging on to a shot from Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson at the second attempt. It was his only save of the night.

The second Iceland goal was caused by dreadful work by the entire Scotland defence, culminating with Slicker failing to scramble the ball off his line after it ricocheted towards goal off Lewis Ferguson.

Half-time should have been an opportunity to regroup and reset, but the third concession was perhaps the most egregious. 

Victor Palsson's header was straight at Slicker, but the ball burst through his arms and into the back of the net.

Moments later, the sparse Hampden crowd cheered ironically when Slicker successfully caught the ball. It summed up a torrid night for the young man.

Eligible through his Scottish father, Slicker was signed by the then League One Ipswich Town from Manchester City for an undisclosed fee in the summer of 2023 on a three-year deal.

The 22-year-old was an unused substitute for City manager Pep Guardiola for several first-team games in the 2021-22 season. He also spent time on loan at Rochdale before moving to Ipswich, but failed to make a league appearance.

He was part of the Tractor Boys squad that recorded back-to-back promotions to the Premier League, making a few appearances in domestic cup competitions along the way and filling in as the back-up keeper on occasion too. 

But Slicker played just 10 minutes for Ipswich last season - in the FA Cup - and is still to make his senior league debut.

He has 17 caps at under-21 level for Scotland - with three clean sheets - and was first called up for the senior squad in November 2024.

"It's difficult for Cieran, I really feel for him," the Scotland head coach told BBC Sport Scotland. 

"He got thrown into a situation that he wasn't quite ready for but Craig Gordon's injured, Liam Kelly's injured, Zander Clark is injured.

"The only good thing is it came in a friendly match. I'd imagine [Angus Gunn] won't play the next game.

"I've had young Callan McKenna in the squad so he'll travel then we'll have a look and see if we can find another goalkeeper in Scotland who's not on holiday."

Clarke on Scotland's goalkeeper crisis

Not only are Gordon, Kelly and Clark out at present, Robby McCrorie went down in the warm-up. It all likelihood, he's the one who would have come on against Iceland.

With Gunn and McCrorie likely to be out of Monday's friendly against Liechtenstein, too, and Slicker's confidence through the floor, will Clarke turn to someone else?

"You have to find out what's in the player's mind as well, how he's feeling about it," former Scotland defender Willie Miller said of Slicker.

"What you're looking for is honesty from him. Does he feel like he can take on the challenge in the next game, or that he doesn't want to?

"Does the manager want to take him out of the firing line?"

McKenna, 18, has more senior experience than Slicker, but not by much. He played nine matches for Queen's Park in the Scottish Championship before signing for Bournemouth in 2024. 

He's been in their development squad since and has been with the Scotland group as a training player for the past week.

Given the lack of options, Clarke's first phone call might be to Jon McLaughlin.

The two-time Scotland cap, 37, only played one FA Cup game for Swansea City last season and is now out of contract. But he was a squad regular, is experienced, and would likely be considered one of the safest options. 

Dundee goalkeeper Jon McCracken was in Scotland squads during the season just gone, but was replaced between at Dens Park by Trevor Carson midway through the term.

Other Scotland-based options would be Scott Bain - recently released by Celtic - or Ross Doohan - recently signed by Celtic.

MK Dons keeper Craig MacGillivray has previously been called up by Clarke, too, but would appear to be a long way down the pecking order these days.

Cieran Slicker made his Scotland debut before playing a senior league match

Clarke was much more candid about Slicker's night than many thought he might be.

He spoke about this was too early for him, him not being ready for it. It's clear that the lad is suffering after being thrown in to a situation.

It also sounds like he was always going to be third choice - and therefore there for experience rather than game time - until McCrorie's injury in the warm-up. It's an unforgiving position.

One thing is clear though, Clarke's manner over the goalkeeping situation was frustration bordering on anger.

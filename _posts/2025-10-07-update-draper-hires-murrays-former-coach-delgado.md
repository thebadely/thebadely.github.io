Let's dive into the details: Jamie Delgado coached Andy Murray from 2016 until 2021

Jack Draper has hired Jamie Delgado, who worked with Andy Murray when he became world number one, as his new head coach.

The British number one will soon begin preparations in earnest for next season, having only been able to play one singles match since Wimbledon because of bone bruising in his left arm.

Delgado will cover the majority of weeks on tour, but there will still be a role for James Trotman who has been by Draper's side for the past four years.

It was a period of great success for Draper, who this year alone reached the world's top four and won his first Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells.

Last year he reached the US Open semi-finals and won his first two ATP titles.

Trotman has spent a lot of weeks away from home in that period, but will still be involved and on tour from time to time.

Delgado's three-year partnership with Grigor Dimitrov came to an end last month, but he is best known for his work with Murray.

When he became the Scot's principal coach in May 2016, after Amelie Mauresmo left the team, he could not have imagined the success that was just around the corner.

Murray reached a first French Open final in June, won a second Wimbledon title in July and ended the year as world number one by winning his last 24 matches of the season.

His hip problems became chronic the following year, but Delgado remained by Murray's side for another five years.

He will be the dominant voice in Draper's ear, with the 23-year-old previously admitting he has struggled having two coaches.

South African Wayne Ferreira briefly joined the team last summer, and helped Draper win his first ATP title in Stuttgart in June. But he was gone by August, with Draper saying he wanted to keep things simple.

"I had every intention of wanting Wayne to be in my team long-term," he said at the US Open that August.

"In my own head, I'm an over-thinker, [so] I like to keep things simple as much as possible.

"I felt like I wanted to keep it to one voice."

Delgado is not the first associate of Murray to join the team, as Draper hired physio Shane Annun and fitness coach Matt Little at the start of this year.

The world number eight is planning to make his comeback at December's three-day UTS Grand Final in London.

The arm injury forced him to withdraw from the US Open after winning his first-round match, but he has been working out regularly at the National Tennis Centre in London in recent weeks.

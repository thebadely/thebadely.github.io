US Ryder Cup crowd 'galvanised' us - McIlroy

Rory McIlroy says he received a "lovely" message from the boss of the PGA of America following the abuse he and his wife Erica suffered at the hands of some American fans at the Ryder Cup.

The Masters champion added he took it as "a compliment" that he was the target of rowdy US supporters and it "galvanised" the European team during their 15-13 victory at Bethpage.

In the aftermath of the tumultuous contest last September, PGA of America CEO Derek Sprague promised to contact McIlroy and his wife. The Masters champion has confirmed he received the message.

"I got a lovely email from Derek Sprague apologising," McIlroy told BBC Sport before competing at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship.

"Erica worked with Derek at the PGA of America back in the day so we know Derek and his wife pretty well. He couldn't have been more gracious or apologetic and he wrote us a lovely letter, which we really appreciated."

Ryder Cup fan behaviour unacceptable - McIlroy

Erica McIlroy was struck by a tossed beer can during the Saturday action in New York and her husband was the subject of sustained abuse throughout the three days of the competition.

"I take it as a compliment that they targeted me," McIlroy said. "But then at the same time, it was a tough week. That made us better as a team.

"It galvanised us and it really put our arms around each other."

The 36-year-old Northern Irishman partnered former Open champion Shane Lowry on both the Friday and Saturday afternoons when the crowds were at their most hostile.

Lowry went on to hole the putt that ensured Europe could not be beaten despite America's stirring fightback in the final day singles.

"Honestly, I was just so happy to have Shane beside me on Friday afternoon and Saturday afternoon. He was like the big brother I never had out there those two afternoons," added McIlroy.

"He played incredible golf to keep us in it. And we won one and a half points out of our two matches. Him holing that putt was just a perfect way to end the week."

McIlroy leads the Race to Dubai rankings 

McIlroy has stated he does not want the crowd scenes to overshadow Europe's brilliant performance, particularly in the foursomes and fourball sessions.

He can look back on what he calls "the season of his golfing life", which brought a long-awaited career grand slam with his Masters triumph as well as victories at the Players Championship, Pebble Beach and the Irish Open.

McIlroy is now targeting success here in Abu Dhabi as well as the season finale at next week's DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.

He is in pole position for a seventh Race to Dubai title but holds only a narrow lead in the standings over England's Marco Penge.

"I remember trying to win my first race to Dubai in 2009 and going up against Lee Westwood for those last couple of events," McIlroy said.

"I was motivated and hungry and really wanted to do it and I'm sure that's exactly how Marco feels. So it's going to be an exciting couple of weeks."

On his return to the Middle East, McIlroy is in a reflective mood after so much success in a year that began in the United Arab Emirates at the Hero Dubai Desert Classic.

"I think back to the start in January of 2025 when I was last here and everything that's happened since," he said.

"Honestly, in my wildest dreams, I didn't know. I mean, I knew a year like this was possible, but it's just been an amazing 10 months."

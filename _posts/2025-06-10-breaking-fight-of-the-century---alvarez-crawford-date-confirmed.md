Let's dive into the details: Turki Alalshikh (centre) announced last month that a super-fight had been agreed between Terence Crawford (left) and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez (right)

Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez's super-fight against Terence Crawford will take place in Las Vegas on Saturday, 13 September.

Mexican pound-for-pound great Alvarez will meet undefeated American Crawford for the undisputed super-middleweight title.

The blockbuster will be streamed globally on Netflix and has been billed the "fight of the century" by Turki Alalshikh, chairman of Saudi Arabia's general entertainment authority.

It will be the first fight to be promoted by Alalshikh in collaboration with UFC president Dana White.

"Turki wants to make the biggest fights that the fans want to see in boxing and this is right up my alley," said White.

"Are you kidding me that the first boxing fight I'm going to get to promote is Canelo versus Crawford? It's literally a once-in-a-lifetime fight."

Alvarez holds all four recognised world titles in the super-middleweight division after the 34-year-old beat William Scull last month.

That resulted in him regaining the IBF belt and the undisputed super-middleweight title, and after the fight Crawford was confirmed as his next opponent, with the pair posing for a face-off in the ring.

"I'm ready to show once again that I am the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world," the Mexican said in a statement on Tuesday.

Alvarez has 63 wins from 67 professional fights, with two draws and two defeats.

Crawford is a four-division and two-weight undisputed champion, and will be moving up from light-middleweight.

The 37-year-old possesses a flawless record, having won all 41 of his pro fights.

"My perfect record speaks for itself," said Crawford. "I am the best fighter in the world and no matter the opponent or weight class, I have always come out on top."

The fight - expected to take place at Allegiant Stadium - will be preceded by a three-city media tour, visiting Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (20 June), before heading to the United States as the fighters appear in New York (22 June) and Las Vegas (27 June).

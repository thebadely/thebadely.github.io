According to new developments, "I never thought I'd make it to this age," says 100-year-old May O'Shea. "I thought I would have died by now."

May's milestone is still one very few people achieve despite the number of centenarians in the UK doubling over the past 20 years.

The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show there were an estimated 16,650 people aged 100 or above living in the UK in 2024, a record high.

In Scotland, where May lives, there are 1,000 centenarians for the first time but it is still an age only reached by one person in every 5,000.

May, who was born in Port Glasgow in 1925, says: "I don't feel 100, I feel much younger. I look at my hands and I'm shocked."

Looking back on her long life, she remembers surviving a German blitz on Port Glasgow during World War 2, which destroyed her neighbours' homes.

"You could see all the flames in the sky, it looked like a sunset," she recalls.

May moved to London after the war and became a cleaner, at one time spending three years working for the iconic 80s band, Depeche Mode.

She had her son Jim, who is now 70 , before moving back to Scotland in later life where she became a grandmother to her three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 

The 100-year-old says she reads two newspapers everyday, which are delivered by Jim, who she credits for keeping her sharp. 

When asked if there's a secret to such a long life, she cites the fact she's "never smoked and never drank", and advises people who want to follow in her footsteps to "just take care of themselves and don't overdo it!"

Paul Shiels, a professor of geroscience at the University of Glasgow, says that the rise in people living to 100 can be explained by improved living conditions, better nutrition and a general improvement in public health.

He said : "Over the last century, we've seen advances in medicine, better detection of disease, better disease treatment, more widespread use of vaccinations and the appearance of antibiotics.

"These are really enabling people who would've died at a younger age to live longer."

The ONS stats show that women make up more than 80% of those who make it to 100.

However, the number of men living to a very old age is rising quickly.

Twenty years ago men accounted for 10.9% of people aged 100 and over but this is now 18.4%, nearly one in five.

"Women age better than men," says Prof Shiels.

"They handle psychosocial stress a lot better and tend to be more social.

"There's no clear answer as to why the rate of men reaching 100 is increasing faster than women, I think that it could be the case that the number of women has reached a plateau, and men are catching up.

"It may be that we'll see a further small increase in the number of people reaching 100 over the next few decades, but I don't think it will be dramatic."

For 104-year-old Mary Smith, good genes are the key to a long life.

Mary was born in Korea in 1921 to British parents, before travelling the world with the Navy.

She was 23 years old when WW2 ended, a day she still describes as her "favourite memory".

"I had been posted to America when it was announced that the war in Europe had ended," she recalls.

"I was in a ship, halfway across the Atlantic ocean, and we were able to turn the lights on for the first time."

During her time in Washington DC she married her husband, a British Army officer, and had two sons.

She credits her longevity to her "tough ancestors".

"My ancestors have always remained spry, both mentally and physically, and all remained very active right into their old age," she says.

Her carers at Murrayside Care Home in Edinburgh also add that she "never misses a gym class".

"They keep me fit and keep me moving, stop me stiffening up  - I'm very determined, I won't give up," she says.

Prof Shiels says that, although genes play a role in living a long life, they are not the main factor which determine whether you'll live to be 100.

He says: "We're still finding out lots more about what really causes how we age, and the big surprise is that your environment is probably more of an influence on your age and age-related health than your genetics."

Instead, he says, environmental stressors such as whether or not you have a balanced diet; whether you smoke or drink alcohol; oral health and the amount of exercise you get  play the biggest role.

"There's unique aspects of ageing, but the general picture is relatively uniform," Prof Shiels says.

"If more of us want to live to 100 we have to change our environment and we have to modify our lifestyle.

"There's a lot of scientific influencers now saying they can rejuvenate you, but I'm very sceptical of that.

"In the real world you need balance. Cutting stress, doing things in moderation and being social â€“ these are the best ways to get near 100."

Jean Aitken, an ex-teacher also from Port Glasgow, has some additional tips that she thinks has helped her reach her 100th year.

"Everybody always wants to know the secret." she says.

"I've never been sporty, but all my life I've always done a lot of Scottish country dancing," she says.

"Another thing is I don't drink milk and never have done - I've never liked it."

Jean lived with her twin sister Margaret, who passed away at 92, before moving into a nursing home at age 99.

She has taken courses on how to use an iPad, which she uses to order her shopping and to share pictures and videos with her family.

Her great-niece, Stephanie Bell, described her as a greatly positive person who is  "always living life to the full".

For Jean, the advice for living into your hundreds is simple.

She says: "You just keep going, you've just got to keep going."

It has been recently reported that Bracken (left) and Porter get their chance with four frontline scrum-halves unavailable

Scrum-halves Charlie Bracken and Will Porter have been named in an England training squad for a four-day camp, while Northampton full-back George Furbank will continue his rehabilitation from concussion as part of the get-together at Pennyhill Park.

Saracens' Bracken - the eldest son of 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Kyran - is in the senior squad for the first time after representing England Under-20s and spending part of this season on loan at Championship side Ampthill.

The 21-year-old is yet to make a Premiership start, having mainly acted as back-up to South African Ivan van Zyl.

Harlequins' Porter, 26, has been rewarded for his impressive form for England A with a chance to work with the senior squad. 

Coach Steve Borthwick is without several scrum-half options, with first-choice Alex Mitchell selected for the British and Irish Lions while Leicester's Jack van Poortvliet and Bath's Ben Spencer are preparing for Saturday's Premiership final and Bristol's Harry Randall is injured.

Northampton's 22-year-old second row Tom Lockett - who has played alongside Bracken at age-grade level and Porter during the second-string's win over Ireland in February - is included along with Bristol prop George Kloska.

With Jamie George helping the Lions prepare for the tour of Australia that Luke Cowan-Dickie has been selected for, Northampton's Curtis Langdon, Bristol's Gabriel Oghre and Saracens' Theo Dan are named as hookers.

Furbank was forced off early in Northampton's Champions Cup final defeat by Bordeaux-Begles last month after being concussed. 

He has had a season interrupted by injury after fracturing his arm in a win over South Africa's Bulls in December that meant he missed the 2025 Six Nations.

Exeter wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, who has not played since suffering a shoulder dislocation in December, will also use the camp to work his way back to match fitness.

England will play a France XV in a non-cap match at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium on Saturday, 21 June before the final touring party is named for the summer's two-Test tour of Argentina and one-off match against the United States in Washington.

excerpt: "Women from ethnic minority communities typically experience perimenopause symptoms earlier and for longer."

It has been recently reported that "When the menopause enlightenment happened, non-white women were still not part of the conversation," says Bami Adenipekun.

The 49-year old equity consultant said she considers her brain now to be "more fantastic than it's ever been" and celebrates her "most powerful season".

But she said it took her a long time to realise symptoms such as memory issues were due to the menopause, following cancer treatment in her mid-30s.

While research is limited, studies have shown women from ethnic minority backgrounds experience menopause differently to white women - and this will be explored at a "marginalised and menopausal" event in Cardiff later this month.

Dr Amara Naseem will speak at the event on World Menopause Day in Cardiff on 18 October.

In her experience as a GP in one of the most diverse parts of the Welsh capital, women from ethnic minority backgrounds are also less likely to seek help with symptoms than her white patients.

It is of particular concern to her given the prevalence of diabetes among south Asian communities, as a lack of oestrogen can cause insulin resistance, meaning those going through perimenopause increase their risk of developing diabetes.

"That's why I would say to women to get prepared because our bodies are different, and because of our ethnicity, our risks are also different," she said. 

The menopause describes the end of a woman's reproductive years, and normally happens around the age of 51.

The lead-up to this happening is known as the peri-menopause. It starts, on average, at 46.

This is when many women notice their periods becoming unpredictable - heavier, lighter, longer or shorter - and experience feelings or physical problems they haven't had before.

Project manager for the event, Sahir Ahmed-Evans, said she hopes it will spread reliable information to women from ethnic minority communities, but crucially, from women who look like them.

The 47-year-old menopause coach said she now realises her perimenopause symptoms started in her 30s, but a medical menopause two years ago was a shock to the system.

"I thought I was dying," she said. 

"But after a few months it was like a silver lining for me."

She had been living for years with undiagnosed endometriosis and adenomyosis, so injections to put her into menopause felt like "a liberation" from symptoms, and a chance to reset and focus on her wellness.

"As a Pakistani, Asian woman, I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother, I'm a wife, I'm a business owner, a content creator, and you just give, give, give," she said. 

"Then your body says 'but there's nothing left, when are you going to give to yourself?'

"So I feel like it's nature's way to say 'now it's time to step back and take something for yourself'."

She said in addition to the different physical symptoms, there can be cultural pressures and stigmas at play among some black and Asian communities, where the topic of women's health can be a taboo.

Bami agreed, saying: "If it's spoken of as just a rite of passage, then what do you do?

"The older generation will say you just have to be strong, because they've never been told there was help available."

But she believes systemic racism – a point acknowledged in the race equality action plan for Wales – only serves to further disadvantage women.

Her own experience in the workplace left her feeling "vilified and punished severely" when symptoms affected her cognition, pain levels or emotions.

Dr Naseem said creating a trusted space to discuss topics such as vaginal dryness, itching or loss of libido was also crucial.

"Women from marginalised societies might not be very open to talk about these things," she said. 

"It's so important for us to provide a safe space for those women."

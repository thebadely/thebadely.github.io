It has been recently reported that Kenworthy won Olympic silver while representing the United States in 2014

Team GB skier Gus Kenworthy will not be punished after appearing to urinate a graphic message about the United States' immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) in the snow, then posting a photograph of it online.

Kenworthy shared the image - in which 'ICE' was preceded by an expletive - on Instagram a week before he is due to compete at the Winter Olympics in Italy.

A spokesperson from the International Olympic Committee told the Press Association that Kenworthy would not be punished for the post.

"During the Olympic Games, all participants have the opportunity to express their views as per the athlete expression guidelines. The IOC does not regulate personal social media posts," they said.

In his Instagram post, Kenworthy added: "Innocent people have been murdered, and enough is enough. We can't wait around while ICE continues to operate with unchecked power in our communities."

The US said they would send ICE agents to the Games to help support American security operations, prompting anger from the Italian foreign office and citizens.

US vice-president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio are in Milan for Friday's opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium and watched Team USA's opening ice hockey match on Thursday.

Kenworthy, 34, was born in Chelmsford but has lived in the United States for most of his life.

He won silver in the ski slopestyle at the Sochi 2014 Games while representing the US, as well as five medals at the X Games.

He switched to represent Team GB in 2019, competing at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, and will feature in the men's snowboard halfpipe event, with qualifying beginning on 19 February in Livigno, Italy.

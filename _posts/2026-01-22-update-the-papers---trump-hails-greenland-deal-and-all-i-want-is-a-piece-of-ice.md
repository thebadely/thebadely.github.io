It has been recently reported that The majority of the front pages focus on Donald Trump's announcement of a framework deal for Greenland, including the Guardian which says the US president "abruptly stepped back" from threats to impose tariffs on European allies as leverage "after weeks of rhetoric that risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in decades". The Times reports a sense of "palpable relief" in European capitals at the development, while the Daily Express suggests it proves Western nations "should not panic" every time Mr Trump "tries a new gambit".

The lack of details about the framework deal prompts several papers to speculate what could be involved. Sources have told the Daily Telegraph it stops short of the sale of Greenland, but would instead allow the US to have sovereign control of its military bases on the island. According to the Daily Mail, Trump is mulling making the 57,000 residents of the territory an offer of $1m each if they vote to join the US. Nato officials have told the i Paper they fear the President could "demand Greenland as the price of support for Ukraine".

The Daily Mirror is highly critical of Trump's appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he delivered an "unhinged and rambling" speech to an audience of "aghast" world leaders. The Daily Star notes the president repeatedly confused Greenland with Iceland, while the Daily Telegraph argues it was "not so much a speech as a comedy special, with bitchy anecdotes and savage impersonations". The paper describes Trump's parody of his French counterpart as involving an accent "that many European states would prosecute as a hate crime".

The main news for the Sun is the decision by Dame Prue Leith to leave the Great British Bake Off after almost a decade as a judge on the show.  It claims she will be replaced by Nigella Lawson, with the telly cook said to be "ready to sign on the dotted line" ahead of the start of filming for the new series in April. The paper's headline plays on a well-known type of pastry, saying "Nigella's a choux-in".

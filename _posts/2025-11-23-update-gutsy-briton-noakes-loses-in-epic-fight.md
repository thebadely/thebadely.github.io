Here’s what you need to know: Sam Noakes suffered a first career defeat in his 18th pro fight 

Briton Sam Noakes put in a gutsy performance but fell short in his bid to become lightweight world champion, losing on points to Abdullah Mason for the vacant WBO title in Saudi Arabia.

In a thrilling and close contest between two unbeaten stars, Noakes, 28, was hampered by a bloodied left eye after a clash of heads in the third round but kept coming forward, landing thudding punches on the inside.

It was the eye-catching uppercuts and slick long-range boxing from 21-year-old southpaw Mason, however, that made the difference, as he upped the tempo in the second half.

Mason rocked Noakes in the 10th, but the Maidstone fighter clung on and fought back valiantly until the final bell.

With scores of 117-111, 115-113, 115-113, American Mason claims his 20th pro win and becomes the youngest reigning male world champion.

Noakes had hoped to cap his remarkable rise from supermarket jobs, roofing, and railway work to world champion.

He suffers the first defeat of his career after 17 straight wins, including 15 stoppages, but in a fight-of-the-year contender, he proved he belongs at the top level and will have earned himself a fanbase around the world.

Earlier, Devin Haney became a three-weight world champion with a points victory over Brian Norman Jr to claim the WBO welterweight belt. Haney dropped the champion in the second round and cruised to a dominant decision.

Also on the undercard of Briton Anthony Yarde's WBC light-heavyweight title challenge against David Benavidez, Jesse 'Bam' Rodriguez knocked out Fernando Martinez in the 10th round to add the WBA crown to his WBO and WBC super-flyweight titles.

Mason becomes the youngest current male world champion in boxing, extending his record to 20 wins with 17 knockouts

A grinning Noakes made a relaxed ringwalk to a surprising choice - the soaring strains of Luciano Pavarotti's 'Nessun dorma'.

Mason looked equally confident in Riyadh. The Ohio fighter, a 65-15 amateur standout, has been widely hailed as one of boxing's future stars. 

He opened with a slick southpaw jab, but the compact Noakes, keeping a high guard, closed the distance well. 

Noakes tried to bully Mason and work the body but was staggered by a well-timed left in the third. 

After the accidental head clash, a doctor cleared him to continue. Promoter Frank Warren, who called Noakes one of Britain's most exciting fighters, grew animated, urging him on.

Mason began to move freely and showed his superior hand speed, but a stubborn Noakes landed a heavy overhand right in the fourth. 

The former British, Commonwealth, and European champion had quietly built momentum over the years with little fanfare, and was well in the fight by the halfway stage.

Noakes picked up a bad cut early on

A left hook to the body slowed Mason in the seventh, though he responded with combinations as the contest ebbed and flowed. 

But Mason, who had never been past six rounds before, began to assert his control and landed a stinging uppercut in the eighth - a shot that repeatedly troubled Noakes throughout the fight.

Noakes was badly hurt in the 10th as Mason connected with a left hand to the head and then sunk an uppercut to the body of the dazed Noakes. But somehow Noakes stayed on his feet, continuing to fight and landing his own body shots in the 11th.

There were some close rounds, and both men gave it their all, but Mason deservedly edged the decision. 

Speaking to BBC Sport last September, Noakes said he wanted a world-title win to unfold "like a Rocky film": being dropped, rising from the canvas with blackened eyes, and finding a way to triumph. 

He may not have got the victory, but he played out his own Rocky-style script in the ring. 

Perhaps he will do better in the sequel; after such a terrific contest with two styles that meshed, a rematch is warranted.

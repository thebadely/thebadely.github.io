New Zealander Ryan Fox beat American Sam Burns at a fourth play-off hole to claim a dramatic victory at the Canadian Open.

Fox sank a birdie at the 18th hole of his fourth round to set up a play-off against Burns, who had produced a stunning eight-under-par round of 62 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley.

Burns hit nine birdies and a bogey to take the clubhouse lead and it seemed it would be enough for victory until Fox's heroics on the last hole in his round of 66.

The par five 18th was the sudden death play-off hole and, after Fox grazed the hole with his fourth shot and had to settle for a par, Burns failed to capitalise as he missed a makeable putt to win on the first time around.

At the next attempt, Fox nearly went into the water with his second shot before both again could not be separated as they made par.

The location of the hole was changed for their third attempt but the pair again holed in par before going for a fourth time.

This time, Fox produced a brilliant second shot and, after Burns took five, he made a birdie to win a second PGA Tour title on the back of his first triumph at last month's Myrtle Beach Classic.

"It was very hard-fought," said Fox. "I was pretty lucky to make that putt in regulation [at the 18th]. It just snuck in.

"I didn't hit a couple of great shots in play-off and Sam let me off there the first time around.

"Nice to hit a good one that fourth time - that's probably the best shot I've ever hit in my life. Nice to do it in these circumstances."   

England's David Skinns produced a strong showing as he hit a 67 to finish on 13 under at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley.

Ireland's Shane Lowry had started strongly with an eagle and three birdies to briefly move into the lead on 15 under before his challenge faded.

He bogeyed the ninth, 16th and 17th holes while hitting a birdie on the 15th to go round in 67 as he finished on 13 under.

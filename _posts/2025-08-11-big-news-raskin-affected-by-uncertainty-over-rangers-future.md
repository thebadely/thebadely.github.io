Experts revealed that Nico Raskin has started Rangers' past two matches as a substitute

Rangers midfielder Nico Raskin has been impacted by "uncertainty" over his future at the club, according to head coach Russell Martin.

The Belgium international has been linked with big money moves away from Ibrox and Martin concedes that contact from external parties has had an effect.

"There's been a bit of uncertainty about him this summer, for sure," Martin said before Tuesday's second leg of the Champions League third qualifying round tie at Viktoria Plzen.

"Not from people ringing us, but I think from people ringing him, definitely.

"I think that's affected his approach, not in terms of professionalism and stuff, but he's a young man, of course it's going to have an impact at some point."

Raskin started the first three games of Rangers' season, but was left out of the starting XI for the first leg of the tie against Viktoria Plzen, which Martin's side won 3-0 at Ibrox.

The 24-year-old was again benched for Saturday's Premiership match against Dundee, but impressed as a substitute in the 1-1 draw. 

Martin expressed his delight at how Raskin has responded to being dropped.

"He came out of the team for reasons that me and him spoke about, and his reaction has been top, like really, really brilliant," he said.

"He's a really fantastic player, and he's a young man that I'm getting to know all the time, and actually I really like his character and personality.

"It's my job to make sure, playing for this football club, whoever you are, the demands are really clear, in whatever position you play."

When asked if he expects Raskin to stay at Rangers beyond this summer, Martin said it would take a "mind-blowing" offer for the Ibrox club to consider selling one of last season's standout performers.

"I don't think we're in a position where we have to sell anyone," Martin said. "I don't think we're in a position where we want to lose some of the best performers last season, that we think can become really top performers for us moving forward.

"Unless someone comes in and blows our minds and everyone decides, the player, the club, that it's the best for everyone - and then we can make sure we're in a position to replace them with someone else. 

"It's the same for any club in world football now. I don't think there is a club that's immune to that really.

"Hopefully, we can get to the end of the window. He's played brilliantly. The window shuts, he's still here, and then we can keep improving and keep kicking on."

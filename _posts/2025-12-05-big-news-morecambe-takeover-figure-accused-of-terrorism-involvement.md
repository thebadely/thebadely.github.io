Let's dive into the details: Morecambe are in the National League relegation zone after a summer of takeover turmoil

A man who promised "discipline, trustfulness and compassion" to Morecambe fans when fronting Panjab Warriors' takeover of the club has been sanctioned by the UK government over accusations of involvement in terrorism.

Gurpreet Singh Rehal was one of the key figures behind the takeover deal, finally concluded in August after a long legal battle with previous owner Jason Whittingham lasting several months.

According to the Treasury, Rehal is alleged to have recruited, purchased weapons and provided finance for Babbar Khalsa and Babbar Akali Lehar, militant groups respectively proscribed and sanctioned under UK law which aim to create an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region of India.

His UK assets have been frozen by the Treasury and he has been banned as a company director.

"The UK has today announced an asset freeze and director disqualification against Gurpreet Singh Rehal, who is suspected of belonging to organisations involved in terrorism in India," a government statement said., external

In a statement, Morecambe and Panjab Warriors distanced themselves from Rehal.

"An individual who previously held a consultancy role in marketing and communications with our organisations is no longer affiliated with either Morecambe FC or Panjab Warriors," they said.

"This consultancy position carried no strategic, financial or operational authority, and he had no involvement in the ownership or club decision-making.

"Following recent serious concerns that have come to light, we took immediate and decisive action, and his association with both organisations has been fully removed."

The Independent Football Regulator said it was "working with relevant authorities and using our statutory information gathering powers to look into this matter urgently".

The BBC has contacted Morecambe FC for comment.

Gurpreet Singh Rehal appeared in a BBC interview on the day Panjab Warriors' takeover of the club was confirmed

Panjab Warriors' takeover of Morecambe was met with delight by fans, who were facing the prospect of their team ceasing to exist after they were suspended from the National League over unpaid debts and salaries.

The group - made up of various Sikh investors, with most of their money coming from principal shareholder Kuljeet Singh Momi - eventually purchased the club shortly before a deadline to provide proof of funds.

On their first day as owners, Rehal was at the Mazuma Mobile Stadium orchestrating their press relations. He was introduced to the BBC as Panjab Warriors' head of communications, and it was he and CEO Ropinder Singh who opted to conduct the group's first public interview.

"We'll be so transparent, you're going to be sick of us," Rehal claimed in the interview.

Rehal was not listed as a director or shareholder in the club's accounts, but referred to Panjab Warriors as "we" throughout the interview, despite the group's insistence he was an external consultant.

He also insisted the group's heritage would make them more ethical football club owners.

"Punjab, the land of five rivers, is our native land. For us, our heritage, our culture and our faith are our core principles. They make us who we are.

"All we want to say is, trust us."

In its statement announcing the sanctions, the Treasury said: "This is the first use of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Regime to disrupt funding for Pro-Khalistan militant group Babbar Khalsa."

Labour MP and economic secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby said: "We will not stand by while terrorists exploit Britain's financial system. 

"This landmark action shows we are prepared to use every tool at our disposal to choke off funding for terrorism - wherever it occurs and whoever is responsible. The UK stands firmly with peaceful communities against those who promote violence and hatred."

It is now against UK law to make funds or financial services available to Rehal, who earlier this week was pictured on social media meeting National League CEO Phil Alexander on behalf of Morecambe.

Let's dive into the details: Xiao Guodong and Zhao Xintong are ranked 14th and 10th in the world respectively

Zhao Xintong narrowly missed out on a 147 break after Xiao Guodong had earlier hit a maximum as both players progressed to the second round at the Wuhan Open.

World champion Zhao, 28, of China fluffed a straightforward final pink as he closed in on a 147 during a 5-3 victory over Ukraine's Iulian Boiko.

Zhao, who made back-to-back breaks of 132 and 134, the latter in his near-miss, rounded off the win with a visit of 122.

Defending champion Xiao, 36, had earlier made a maximum during his 5-0 thrashing of former women's world champion Mink Nutcharut of Thailand.

"To make a 147 here today - and my first ever maximum break in China - was really special. I was thrilled to achieve that," China's Xiao told World Snooker.

Elsewhere, world number one Judd Trump cruised through with an emphatic 5-1 victory over Pakistan's Farakh Ajaib.

The Englishman was already leading 3-1 when he put together a break of 130, and eventually clinched victory with a half-century in the sixth frame.

Three-time world champion Mark Williams made a century break in each of the first three frames en route to a 5-3 victory over fellow Welshman Liam Davies. 

Veteran Englishman Jimmy White was knocked out in the first round following a 5-2 defeat by Hong Kong's Marco Fu.

Mark Allen, Mark Selby, Jak Jones, Gary Wilson, Barry Hawkins and Jackson Page also all progressed to the second round.

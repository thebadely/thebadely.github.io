excerpt: "The government confronts a cluster of catastrophes, all linked to small boat crossings."

Let's dive into the details: The government confronts a cluster of catastrophes on the very topic that is arguably the most visible state failure they are trying to deal with: small boat crossings.

The numbers of migrants arriving on small boats is big and the knock-on consequences of those arrivals are bigger: the costs, the hotels, the public anguish.

The accidental release of one of the most high profile prisoners jailed this year left jaws on the floor at Westminster just as it did around the country.

Hadush Kebatu was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14 year old girl and a woman in July in Epping in Essex, where he had been living in an asylum hotel since arriving in the UK on a small boat.

His arrest led to a series of protests in the area, which spread to other hotels around the country housing asylum seekers.

In other words, he personified the scale of the issue and the depth and breadth of the anger provoked by it – and yet he was let out of prison by accident.

How on earth did that possibly happen? Have a listen to the conversation I had with His Majesty's Inspector of Prisons, Charlie Taylor, in which I asked him exactly this, on BBC Newscast.

And, on top of this, a report by MPs has concluded the Home Office has "squandered" billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation.

There is a recurring theme here. 

I have reported from Westminster for more than 20 years. Not long after I first arrived, the then Home Secretary, Labour's John Reid, repeated a line he had heard from one of his then department's senior officials – that parts of the Home Office were "not fit for purpose."

One of the solutions back then was to take some of the Home Office's responsibilities away and set up a new department – the Ministry of Justice.

The thing is, of the two issues we are talking about here, one lands at the Home Office's door (asylum accommodation arrangements) and the other is down to the Ministry of Justice (letting prisoners out by accident).

And the criticisms of the Home Office have continued.

A report compiled under the last government by a now serving Conservative MP, Nick Timothy, who used to work as a special adviser at the Home Office, paints a deeply unflattering picture.

To be fair, the nature and responsibilities of the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice are among the thorniest domestic policy issues.

But I am struck when I speak to political figures inside the Home Office that they privately acknowledge that not only was Timothy onto something, but many of his observations from a few years ago are still visible to them today.

They hope new leadership – a new Permanent Secretary, Dame Antonia Romeo and a new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, can help change that.

But there have been plenty of new lead civil servants and new home secretaries in that department over the last two decades.

Why all this matters acutely right now is all this represents an overlap of failings on that most prominent of issues – small boats.

Little wonder we had the Health Secretary Wes Streeting over the weekend publicly fretting that there is a "deep disillusionment… and a growing sense of despair about whether anyone is capable of turning this country around".

And that is an analysis coming from one of those who is responsible for doing so.

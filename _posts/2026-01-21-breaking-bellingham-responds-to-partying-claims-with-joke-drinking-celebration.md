Let's dive into the details: Jude Bellingham has six goals and four assists in 24 matches

Jude Bellingham has dismissed reports about his lifestyle off the pitch as "outside noise", adding his celebration after scoring in Real Madrid's Champions League win over Monaco was intended as "a bit of a joke back to the fans".

Bellingham scored Real Madrid's final goal - and his first of 2026 - in a comfortable 6-1 Champions League victory and marked the occasion by performing a drinking gesture.

The moment quickly drew attention online.

The celebration came after well-known Spanish YouTuber AuronPlay, who has over 29 million subscribers, made viral comments about Bellingham before Real Madrid faced Levante at the weekend. 

He claimed Belliingham "loves alcohol too much" and has visited "every nightclub in Spain", suggesting this is affecting the midfielder's form.

Bellingham was subsequently among the players singled out for boos and whistles from the stands during the 2-0 win against Levante. 

"It feels like anyone now can get a camera, say what they want and the whole world just believes them with no evidence," Bellingham told TNT Sports after Tuesday's Champions League fixture. 

"I feel there's two ways you can take it. You can cry about it and moan, or you can just roll with it and enjoy it.

"[The gesture] was a bit of a joke back to the fans and to the people who say whatever they want. 

"For me, I know the truth and I know what really goes on in my personal life.

"I know what I give to the game, what I give in the game and what I try to give to the team. 

"All the outside noise doesn't really matter but it's nice to have a little joke."

The 22-year-old added: "I've always said the fans pay their money, work all week and save up to come to Real Madrid games to support us so they're entitled to say what they want. 

"This was the kind of performance we have to deliver more for our fans."

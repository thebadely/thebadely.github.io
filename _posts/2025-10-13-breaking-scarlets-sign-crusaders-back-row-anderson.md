Experts revealed that Fletcher Anderson made three appearances in Crusaders' Super Rugby Pacific title-winning campaign

Scarlets have signed number eight Fletcher Anderson from New Zealand province Crusaders.

The 22-year-old will join Dwayne Peel's squad in November having won the Super Rugby Pacific title.

He has also three awards for his efforts with Tasman Makos in New Zealand's top domestic competition, the National Provincial Championship (NPC).

"He's a powerful, abrasive carrier with a strong work-rate in defence," said Peel.

"We are excited about what he can offer us and look forward to welcoming him to Llanelli ahead of a massive block of fixtures for us in the URC and Champions Cup."

Fletcher said: "I have heard very good things from other players in the squad about the direction the team is heading and I'm really excited to get to Llanelli and meet everyone.

"Last season for the Scarlets was a step in the right direction making the play-offs and I'm looking forward to hopefully playing a part in helping the team push on further this season."

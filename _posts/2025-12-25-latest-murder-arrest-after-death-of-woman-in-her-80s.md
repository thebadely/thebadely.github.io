It has been recently reported that A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman in her 80s died in an incident at a flat.

Police were called to the flat in Keepers Road, Devizes, at about 08:10 GMT after reports of a serious assault.

Despite efforts from the South Western Ambulance Service, the force confirmed that the victim died at the scene.

A 63-year-old woman was arrested and has since been taken to hospital for treatment of injuries which are not thought to be life-changing.

DI Alan Smith, from the Major Crime Investigation Team, said: "This is a tragic incident in which an elderly woman has lost her life on Christmas Day.

"We have arrested a woman who is known to the victim and I can confirm we are not looking for anyone else in connection with it.

"A scene has been set up at the flat and an urgent investigation is being carried out, which will involve house-to-house enquiries.

"Local residents will see an increased policing presence over the coming days. If you have any concerns, or you have any information, please don't hesitate to speak to one of our officers."

The force added that a cordon has been set up at the address and is likely to remain in place for the rest of Thursday and into Friday.

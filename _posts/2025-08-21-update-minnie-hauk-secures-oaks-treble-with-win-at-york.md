Let's dive into the details: Minnie Hauk was the 8-15 favourite to win the Group One Yorkshire Oaks showpiece

Minnie Hauk secured an Oaks treble with a comfortable victory in the Yorkshire Oaks on day two of the Ebor meeting at York.

The three-year-old filly, ridden by Ryan Moore and trained by Aidan O'Brien, beat runner-up Estrange by three and a half lengths.

She had already won the Oaks at Epsom in June and the Irish Oaks at the Curragh in July.

Minnie Hauk's stablemate, Garden of Eden, finished in third place and Qilin Queen was fourth.

David O'Meara's Estrange did try to put late pressure on Minnie Hauk but was unable to match the 8-15 favourite's pace and power.

Minnie Hauk's win gives trainer O'Brien a record-equalling ninth Yorkshire Oaks victory, while this was also jockey Moore's fifth win in the race.

O'Brien told ITV Racing: "She's beautiful. She does everything right, she cruises, she's a lovely mover and obviously the [Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe] and the Breeders' Cup Turf, all those races are there for her."

Moore, 41, added: "She is a straightforward filly and her record indicates how classy she is. She does not do a lot when she hits the front, but she does what you ask her to do."

Queen Camilla became a patron of York Racecourse in 2024

O'Brien and Moore were presented with their trophies by Queen Camilla, who also came down to the winners' enclosure to offer her congratulations.

"We are honoured Her Majesty came over and appeared in the picture," O'Brien said. 

Also on Thursday, Royal Fixation beat fellow 5-2 joint favourite America Queen in the Group Two Lowther Stakes.

Royal Fixation, trained by Ed Walker and ridden by William Buick, finished off strongly to sprint away and win the race for two-year-old fillies by a length.

"She is not very big but has a big heart. I wanted to put it right today as I felt we should have won at Newmarket [she finished second] last time," said 37-year-old Buick.

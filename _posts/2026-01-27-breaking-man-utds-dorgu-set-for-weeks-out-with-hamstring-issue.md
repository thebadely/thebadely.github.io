Here’s what you need to know: Patrick Dorgu leaves the pitch during Manchester United's win at Arsenal

Manchester United's Patrick Dorgu is likely to be out for a number of weeks after injuring his hamstring during Sunday's 3-2 win at Arsenal.

The 21-year-old, who lashed in United's second goal from the edge of the box, limped off in the closing stages of the match with what interim head coach Michael Carrick hoped was cramp.

It is more significant than that but sources say the Denmark international is still being assessed and the timescale for his absence is not clear.

The in-form Dorgu, who joined United as a wing-back from Italian club Lecce 12 months ago, has excelled in an advanced left-sided attacking role under Carrick, and also scored in the previous win over Manchester City.

United have eight Premier League games before the March international break, when Dorgu is expected to be involved for Denmark in the World Cup play-offs.

Dorgu's absence could lead to a greater role for Matheus Cunha, who has started United's past two games on the substitutes' bench but scored the winner against Arsenal.

Dorgu's absence for the next few weeks is the first cloud to appear on Carrick's bright new horizon at Manchester United.

Dorgu, who struggled to establish him at Old Trafford following a Â£25m move from Lecce in February 2025, has flourished since Carrick succeeded sacked Ruben Amorim.

The 21-year-old who was on the margins for so long, has played a key role in Carrick's opening victories in the derby against Manchester City at home and away to Premier League leaders Arsenal with goals in both games, including a spectacular 25-yard strike in the 3-2 victory at Emirates Stadium.

Dorgu has been utilised in an advanced left-sided attacking position and has been a revelation as United have been transformed since Carrick's arrival.

It is a blow to both Carrick and Dorgu, who will now be forced to watch from the sidelines just as the Denmark international was starting to show exactly why he was so highly regarded, and why former boss Amorim and current director of football Jason Wilcox were so keen to bring him to Old Trafford.

According to new developments, Five American soldiers were injured after an Army sergeant opened fire at a military base in the US state of Georgia before being tackled by other troops. 

Officials say the soldier, identified as Quornelius Radford, opened fire with his own personal handgun, and was targeting his fellow troops. 

The attack at Fort Stewart, about 240 miles (386km) south east of Atlanta, triggered a lockdown at the sprawling Army base. 

All five soldiers who were shot are being treated for their injuries and are in stable condition, according to Brigadier General John Lubas, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division.

Speaking to reporters, Gen Lubas confirmed that the alleged attacker was an active-duty solider, and that he had not previously deployed to a combat zone. 

He also thanked the "brave soldiers" who intervened and subdued the shooter, adding that they "without a doubt" prevented further harm.

They "immediately and without hesitation" tackled the suspect and subdued him, allowing police to take him into custody, he said.

Sgt Radford, who is part of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, is in pre-trial confinement, Gen Lubas said.

He is being interviewed by Army criminal investigators, and no motive has yet been disclosed. He was previously arrested by local police for driving under the influence - a fact that was not known to US military before the attack, said Gen Lubas.

Three of the soldiers who were shot have undergone surgery, he said. 

The pistol used in the attack was not military-issued, and officials are investigating how he was able to bring it onto the base.

Law enforcement was alerted to the shooting at 10:56 EST (15:56 GMT) and the gunman was apprehended 39 minutes later at 11:35 EST. 

Video shared on social media showed military personnel evacuating from the scene. 

A Burger King manager working at a restaurant on the military base described to BBC News how the staff hid in a safe room after a lockdown was announced.

Hidden in the sealed chamber designed to insulate them from the outside world, the group monitored social media for updates.

"I pulled them into the room so they didn't hear anything," the restaurant's manager said, referring to the sound of gunshots.

"They knew it was an active shooter but they didn't know exactly where."

When it was safe to emerge, their phones started to explode with calls from worried family members.

Outside, a line of customers had formed at the door. Some people sheltered in their cars in the drive-through queue during the ordeal.

"I wasn't worried about the food, I was worried about my crew," she says. "It's my job to keep them safe."

President Donald Trump, speaking at an unrelated event at the White House, said Army investigators will ensure that the attacker is properly punished. 

"The perpetrator of this atrocity - and that's exactly what it is, an atrocity, will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law," Trump said.

"We're not gonna forget what happened," he added.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp asked residents to pray for the victims.

"We are keeping the victims, their families, and all those who answer the call to serve in our hearts and prayers, and we ask that Georgians everywhere do the same," he said. 

At nearly 280,00 acres, Fort Stewart is the largest US Army base east of the Mississippi River, and is home to nearly10,000 people.

It is located in Hinesville, a seaside town about 40 miles (64 kilometres) southwest of Savannah.

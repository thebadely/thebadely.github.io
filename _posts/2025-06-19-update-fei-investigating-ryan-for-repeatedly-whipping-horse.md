It has been recently reported that Heath Ryan finished seventh with Australia in the team dressage event at the 2008 Olympics

The FEI, equestrian sport's world governing body, has launched an investigation into Australian Olympian Heath Ryan after a video emerged that appeared to show him repeatedly whipping a horse.

Ryan was suspended by Equestrian Australia last week after the video - said by Ryan to be about two years old - showed a man striking a horse about 40 times.

The FEI has now also provisionally suspended the 66-year-old, who issued a statement after the video emerged to say he was acting in "the horse's best interest".

But the FEI says it has opened an investigation "following allegations of horse abuse reported to the FEI and Equestrian Australia, as well as the posting of a video on social media showing abusive training techniques".

"The scenes depicted are profoundly disturbing and stand in stark opposition to the core values of FEI horse welfare," FEI secretary general Sabrina Ibanez said.

"The FEI has opened an investigation to thoroughly examine all the facts and determine further disciplinary action under the FEI rules and regulations. We are committed to ensuring that any behaviour which puts horse welfare at risk is dealt with firmly and fairly."

Sam Jones, the CEO of Equestrian Australia, added: "It is both appropriate and welcome that FEI leads the investigation of this matter.

"Equestrian Australia remains extremely concerned about the incident and allegations, and we will support the FEI in any way we can.

"We know our community is keen for answers, but we would ask for patience as the FEI rightly follows a thorough and fair process, in line with their policies and procedures."

Ryan represented Australia in dressage at the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 and finished seventh.

He said the horse, named Nico, came to him after an accident which resulted in a female rider needing hospital treatment.

The Australian said that Nico "had always been a problem child and would just not stop" and after the video he was able to rehome the horse.

Ryan said, external: "I am so sad this was caught on video. If I had been thinking of myself I would have immediately just gotten off and sent Nico to the knackery.

"That video was a life or death moment for Nico and I genuinely had to try my very hardest to see if Nico would consider other options.

"All of this transpired sincerely with the horse's best interests the sole consideration. Unbelievably it was so successful for everyone except me with the release of this video."

Britain's three-time Olympic champion Charlotte Dujardin missed the Paris Games last year after a video emerged of her repeatedly striking a horse around its legs with a long whip. 

She was subsequently banned for a year by the FEI.

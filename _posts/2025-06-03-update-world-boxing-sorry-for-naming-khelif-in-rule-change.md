Here’s what you need to know: Imane Khelif won welterweight gold at the Olympic Games in Paris last year

World Boxing has apologised after Olympic champion Imane Khelif was named in the governing body's announcement of mandatory sex testing.

It released its new policy last week, and singled out the Algerian, saying Khelif will not be allowed to compete in the female category of its competitions until the fighter undergoes the test.

But World Boxing has told BBC Sport its president Boris van der Vorst has since written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to apologise after acknowledging that "the athlete's privacy should have been protected".

Khelif, 26, won women's welterweight gold at the Paris Olympics last year amid a row over gender eligibility.

Khelif, along with Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting, was disqualified from the 2023 World Championships by previous world governing body the International Boxing Association (IBA) for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests.

Khelif was cleared to compete in Paris by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's amateur world governing body in June 2023 over concerns over how it was run.

The IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division in Paris if their passports said they were female.

Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't

Khelif had been set to make a competitive comeback in Eindhoven from 5-10 June.

But on Friday, World Boxing said mandatory sex testing would be introduced next month "to ensure the safety of all participants and deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women."

It added: "In light of plans to introduce this policy and the particular circumstances surrounding some boxers that competed at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing.

"This decision reflects concerns over the safety and wellbeing of all boxers, including Imane Khelif, and aims to protect the mental and physical health of all participants in light of some of the reactions that have been expressed in relation to the boxer's potential participation at the Eindhoven Box Cup."

World Boxing also published a letter it had sent to both Khelif and the Algerian Boxing Federation, claiming that the new eligibility rules were developed "with the express purpose of safeguarding athletes in combat sports" given the "physical risks associated with Olympic-style boxing".

It also said in the letter that in "the event the athlete's sex certification is challenged by the athlete's federation or by World Boxing" the athlete shall be "ineligible to compete until the dispute is resolved".

World Boxing was granted provisional recognition as the sport's international governing federation by the IOC in February 2025, and the Algerian Boxing Federation joined it in September.

Khelif has always competed in the women's division and there is no suggestion the fighter identifies as anything other than a woman.

Some reports took the IBA stating that Khelif has XY chromosomes to speculate that the fighter might have differences of sexual development (DSD), like runner Caster Semenya.

However, the BBC has not been able to confirm whether this is or is not the case.

The IOC made it clear last year this is "not a transgender case".

In a statement on Tuesday, the IOC said it "has always made it clear that eligibility criteria are the responsibility of the respective International Federation. The factors that matter to sports performance are unique to each sport, discipline, and/or event.

"We await the full details of how sex testing will be implemented in a safe, fair and legally enforceable way."

World Boxing has said that its new policy is in the final stages of development, and will mean that "all athletes over the age of 18 that want to participate in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned competition will need to undergo a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete."

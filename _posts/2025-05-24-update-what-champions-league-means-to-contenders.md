Let's dive into the details: All eyes will be on the race for the Champions League on Sunday as the Premier League season reaches its climax.

With the title already secured by Liverpool and Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester relegated, the battle is on to join Arne Slot's champions and Arsenal in qualifying for next season's Champions League.

While Tottenham have also qualified through winning the Europa League, there are still five teams competing for the remaining three Champions League slots - with just three points between them.

Manchester City, Newcastle United and Chelsea are currently in the driving seat to complete England's Champions League six, but, with Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest breathing down their necks, it promising to be a nervy finale.

With around Â£100m up for grabs for the qualifiers - compared to around Â£30m in the Europa League - success on Sunday means a lot more to certain clubs financially and more to others for emotional reasons.

BBC football finance expert Kieran Maguire, said: "From a financial perspective, Champions League qualification for most of the clubs is desirable rather than essential, but for some it is more desirable than others.

"While most Premier League clubs seem to be in a better position than in summer 2024 in terms of Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) compliance, there could be one or two having to balance the books by the financial year end, which is usually 30th June."

BBC Sport take a closer look at what qualifying for the Champions League - or not - means for each club both financially and emotionally.

What they need to qualify

Draw v Fulham

OR if Man City lose, two of their rivals to draw

The only cloud for Manchester City is over the outstanding verdict and potential punishments from the commission hearing into the Premier League's allegations of financial misconduct. If this results in a points deduction then the club may fall out of the Champions League places.

Kieran Maguire: For the two years ended 30 June 2024, before this season's accounts are published, it appears that Manchester City are in the strongest position. 

They have had the benefit of significant player sales during that period meaning that the club will be able to afford a season not in the Champions League easily from a financial perspective.

Man City fan Freddie Pye: Qualification for the premier club competition in European football is unfortunately the bare minimum for the modern day Manchester City side.

That is not of course to undermine the achievement of qualifying via a top-five finish this season. Given all the struggles through fitness and injury blows scattered across the side at crucial points of this season, making it into the Champions League would be a remarkable feat when all is considered.

How would it feel to miss out? You've only got to reminisce about that night in Istanbul, when the most memorable evening in the club's history played out at Ataturk Olympic Stadium - that is what we would be missing out on. 

Experiencing that one more time is the ultimate drive behind getting back into the competition. 

Then you consider the financial impact on the club, the effect on signings, missing out on special nights at a revamped and expanded Etihad Stadiumâ¦ you could go on."

What they need to qualify:

Win v Everton

OR hope teams below them also drop points

Maguire: Newcastle did qualify for the Champions League in 2023-24 and have several players who are coveted by other clubs. Participation in the 2025-26 competition would allow Newcastle to potentially offer lucrative contract extensions to the likes of Alexander Isaak and Bruno Guimaraes, as well as the opportunity to play against the best teams in European football.

Newcastle United fan Charlotte Reynolds: Qualifying for the Champions League is vital for several reasons. For fans, I think it has a hugely symbolic significance; it wasn't a fluke that we made it there two seasons ago. The Champions League is where we want to be and where we belong. It also means the return of huge nights for fans - the 4-1 against Paris St-Germain at St James' Park in 2023 is an historic memory for so many.

From a club side, it means money and it also means we are more likely to keep our paws on elite players like Sandro Tonali, Isak, and Bruno. It also means we might be an attractive prospect for other players. Come and live in the North-East guys! We have so many bridges! Play for us!

Whatever happens, this has been an epic season. Let's make it the very best it can be. 

What they need to qualify

Win v Forest

OR draw v Forest, and Aston Villa draw or lose

Maguire: Chelsea initially appear to be relatively safe with profits in the last two years. Care has to be taken when looking at the club's results though, as they include the sale of Chelsea's women's team at the end of 2023-24 which generated a Â£197m profit to the club. 

"If this figure is removed then Chelsea will be in a more challenging position, especially given the lack of a front of shirt sponsor for almost all of the 24/25 season. Participation in the Uefa Conference League is unlikely to have generated significant profits."

Chelsea fan Will Faulks: Chelsea fans are in a slightly strange position when it comes to Champions League qualification. They have been used to competing at the sharp end of the competition, and have won it within the last few years. 

Scrambling for the "top-four trophy" was something they laughed at Arsenal and Spurs fans for; while they were more focused on Premier League titles races.

Given that, and given the team were one result from the top of the table at the turn of the year, it's hard to feel too excited about just qualifying for the competition. It's been a rather undignified few months of stumbling rather than steaming towards the finish line.

On the other hand, the tension of the race has built steadily, and it would be hard not to be drawn into the drama of it. Stamford Bridge was rocking for the nervy win over Manchester United last Friday, and going to Nottingham Forest on the last day of the season needing to win is a thrilling climax to it all. It certainly beats the months of dead rubbers they've closed out the last couple of seasons with.

What they need to qualify

Win v Man Utd, and Chelsea or Newcastle don't win

Win v Man Utd and Man City lose

OR draw v Man Utd, and Newcastle lose

Maguire: Aston Villa appear to be the club with the biggest challenges in terms of PSR compliance. The club did satisfy the rules in 2023-24, helped to a degree by the sale of Jack Grealish in 2021, as that transaction was included in the three year assessment but drops out of the figures for 2024-25. 

Positives for Villa included participation in this season's Champions League, and the sale of players such as John Duran, Moussa Diaby and Douglas Luiz at substantial profits. Qualification would certainly ease some of the challenges ahead.

Villa spent Â£91 on wages for every Â£100 of revenue generated in 2023-24, well above Uefa's guideline of Â£70. There are potential sanctions from Uefa for clubs who go above this figure via Uefa's Squad Cost Rules, but these tend to be financial penalties rather than ones that impact things on the pitch.

Aston Villa fan David Michael: Back-to-back Champions League qualifications would be pivotal in maintaining the momentum of the Unai Emery revolution at Aston Villa. 

It would not only further cement the club's footballing status at the top table but also provide a vital financial boost - especially amid ongoing wage pressures and broader fiscal challenges.

In the bigger picture, Villa simply can't afford to fall short. Falling behind now risks more than lost prestige - it could mean losing key players and missing out on top transfer targets needed to strengthen this summer.

What they need to qualify

Win v Chelsea, and Villa or Newcastle draw

Maguire: Their finances have improved since the club had a four-point deduction imposed by the Premier League in 2023-24 and qualification is certainly not essential financially.

Nottingham Forest fan Pat Riddell: The fact that Forest are even close to qualifying for the Champions League seems like some kind of wild dream. 

Having won the European Cup two years in succession with Brian Clough in 1979 and 1980, and returned to European competition with Frank Clark 30 years ago, it would mean everything to once again welcome the likes of Bayern Munich and Barcelona to the City Ground.

Of course, a lot has changed since those days, and for a club - hopefully - on the up, it's not make-or-break for us. The team has outperformed everyone's expectations and to make the top five would be an amazing end to an amazing season. Regardless of what happens, the past nine months will live long in the memory.

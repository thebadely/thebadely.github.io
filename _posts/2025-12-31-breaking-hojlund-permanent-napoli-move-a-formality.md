It has been recently reported that Rasmus Hojlund scored twice on Sunday in Napoli's 2-0 win over Cremonese

Striker Rasmus Hojlund completing his permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is a "formality", says their sporting director Giovanni Manna.

The 22-year-old, who joined Manchester in a Â£72m deal from Atalanta in 2023, has scored nine goals since his season-long loan move to the Serie A champions.

Earlier this month, Hojlund posted a picture after winning the Italian Super Cup with the caption: "What a great decision looks like."

When asked if Hojlund's permanent Napoli transfer was just a "formality," Manna replied: "As of today, I think so."

In an interview with Italian publication Corriere dello Sport, he said: "We did everything we could to sign him.

"There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it." 

An obligation to buy clause was included in the deal for Hojlund, but the agreed Â£38m transfer fee has a condition that means the Italian giants must qualify for the Champions League.

Antonio Conte's side sit third in Serie A and would currently qualify.

Hojlund scored four league goals for United last season, but even though he expressed a strong desire to remain at the club, summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo pushed him down the pecking order.

"There's an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League," Manna added.

"The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important."

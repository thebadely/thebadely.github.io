According to new developments, Oxford United were the fifth Championship side Gary Rowett has managed

Oxford United head coach Gary Rowett has been sacked with the club in the Championship relegation zone.

The U's have won just one of their past 10 games and are two points from safety, after slipping into the bottom three 10 days ago.

The 51-year-old had been in charge for a year, almost to the day - having succeeded Des Buckingham on 20 December 2024 - and won 14 and lost 21 of his 50 games.

He led Oxford to survival and a second season in the Championship in May, having taken over the 2024 League One play-off winners when they were a point above the relegation zone.

His assistant Mark Sale has also left, with Craig Short taking interim charge alongside Chris Hackett and Lewis Price.

"Gary joined during a challenging period and deserves immense credit for the hard work and leadership that saw us retain our Championship status last season," chairman Grant Ferguson told the club website., external

"However, following a disappointing run of results, we have had to take this difficult decision in the best interests of the club.

"On behalf of the board, I would like to place on record our thanks to Gary and Mark for their contribution and to wish them all the best for the future."

Oxford's only win since the end of October came at home to Ipswich on 28 November

Having won just four Championship games in the first half of last season, Oxford were staring at an immediate return to League One.

But they appointed the experienced Rowett - who had managed Millwall, Birmingham City, Derby County and Stoke City in the second tier - with the aim of securing Championship survival.

He turned Oxford's fortunes around quickly, winning three successive matches over the Christmas period to open up a nine-point gap to the relegation zone as part of a nine-game unbeaten run in the league that ultimately secured United's survival.

Despite going on a run of five games without a win, Rowett's side rallied with four wins and two draws in the final nine games of the season to end the campaign in 17th place, four points above the drop zone.

But despite keeping a large chunk of their squad this season, Oxford have struggled - their tally of 22 goals scored is the fourth-worst in the division with on-loan 20-year-old Tottenham striker Will Lanskhear their top scorer with five goals. 

They lost their opening three league games this season and were thrashed 6-0 at home by Premier League side Brighton in the second round of the Carabao Cup during a difficult August.

It took until 21 September to get their first league win - a 3-1 victory at Bristol City - but they won just three more games under Rowett, the last a 2-1 victory over Ipswich Town on 28 November.

With Sheffield Wednesday effectively relegated - sitting 30 points from safety on minus nine points after deductions for financial infringements - Oxford's hierarchy have decided to act now in the hope they can avoid being one of the other two sides who will join them in League One come May.

After a run of just one win in 10 games, the decision from United's owners to part company with Rowett ends a spell which started with his first game on Boxing Day a year ago.

His position came under increasing pressure following a 1-0 defeat at Charlton at the weekend where a significant number of the travelling fans were calling for Rowett to leave. 

Questions were also raised about his relationship with the board over transfers, with Rowett making comments about an uncertainty over his budget.

The club say a search for a new head coach has begun and Craig Short will lead first team preparations ahead of their next game at home to Southampton on Boxing Day.

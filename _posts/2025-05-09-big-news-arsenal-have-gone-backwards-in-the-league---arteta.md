Let's dive into the details: Mikel Arteta reiterated his claims that Arsenal have been the best team in the Champions League this season

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says that his team have "gone a step backwards" in the Premier League this season.

After missing out on the title to Manchester City by two points last season, the Gunners are currently 15 points behind champions Liverpool, who they face at Anfield on Sunday (16:30 BST).

Having reached 84 points in 2022-23 and 89 points in 2023-24, Arsenal will end this campaign with a maximum of 76 points.

"In the Premier League we've gone a step backwards," Arteta said.

"With the points that we have created it is clear that we have not done as good as last season, and that's obvious.

"But with the amount of points that we have generated in the last few seasons, we could have won two Premier League titles. So you know how close we are. We are providing the numbers that win you titles."

Arteta's side will also finish trophyless for a fifth straight year following their Champions League semi-final defeat by Paris St-Germain on Wednesday.

However, the Spaniard stood by his claims after the second leg that Arsenal have been the best team in the competition this season.

"One hundred per cent," he added. "I'm watching it back, I'm watching all the statistics.

"And when you look at the important stats that normally give you the best platform to win football matches, it is crystal clear who was better.

"But it is not about the winning probability, or what you've managed, it is actually about making it happen and making it count."

It was prior to Wednesday's match that Arteta first claimed Arsenal would have had two Premier League titles with the number of points they posted in the past two seasons, as Liverpool won the league this year with fewer points.

However, Liverpool, who have 82 points with three games remaining, could yet surpass the Gunners' points totals in each of those seasons.

Arteta confirmed his side would give Arne Slot's team a guard of honour before Sunday's match.

"They deserve that," he said. "They've been the best team, and they've been the most consistent.

"What Arne and the coaching staff have done has been fascinating, and they fully deserve it.

"That is sport, and when somebody is better, you have to applaud and accept it, and try to reach that level."

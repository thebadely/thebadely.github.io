Let's dive into the details: Almost £300,000 has been awarded to two charities in the South East to support the work they do with older residents in financial hardship.

The body Independent Age has given £149,997 to Citizens Advice Swale, in Kent, and a further £150,000 to Age UK East Sussex.

The funding provided to the charities is designed to help older people improve their financial wellbeing and ensure their homes are safe and suitable.

A spokesperson for Independent Age said that this round of funding was focused on coastal communities with high numbers of older private renters, who are "a group shown to be at greater risk of financial hardship".

Hannah Lison, head of grants and partnerships at Independent Age, said: "This funding will enable Citizens Advice Swale and Age UK East Sussex to continue, strengthen, and expand the vital support they provide."

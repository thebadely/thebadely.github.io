Let's dive into the details: Smyth made six successful kicks after missing an early field goal 

Charlie Smyth converted a career-long 57-yard field goal as the New Orleans Saints extended their winning streak to four games with a 34-26 victory at the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.

The 24-year-old from County Down had been listed as "questionable" to play because illness had curtailed his practice time in the build-up, but he recovered from a early miss to convert his next six kicks as the Saints improved to 6-10 for the season.

Smyth - who tied the Saints' franchise record with five successful field goals in one game against the New York Jets last week - began his full NFL career with a 56-yarder in defeat by the Miami Dolphins in Week 13 and matched that distance at Nissan Stadium in Nashville before converting from a yard deeper in the third quarter.

"I thought Charlie did a really good job," said Saints head coach Kellen Moore.

"There was some wind with this game and different elements he had to navigate there.

"Two really big kicks, long kicks, so I thought Charlie had some really good stuff there."

The former Gaelic footballer's day got off to a slow start, missing a 43-yard field goal in the first quarter as the Saints struggled to get going.

However, he recovered to equal his career-long kick in the second to get his side on the board, but the Titans held a 20-10 lead at the half.

Smyth's second successful extra point following a Chris Olave touchdown grab from Tyler Shough brought his team to within three and after the Titans hit back with a field goal, the Mayobridge native landed from 57 to set a new personal record.

It was not the longest kick of the day as Joey Slye converted from 58 yards away to put the Titans six ahead, but Smyth would give his side the lead for the first time in the game when converting a Kevin Austin touchdown midway through the fourth quarter.

A fourth successful PAT would follow Audric Estime's 32-yard dash to the endzone which left the Titans requiring a late touchdown and two-point conversion to force overtime, but the Saints held out.

Kellen Moore's team finish their season with an NFC South divisional game away to the Atlanta Falcons next week.

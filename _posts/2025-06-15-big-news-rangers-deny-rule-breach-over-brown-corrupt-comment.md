It has been recently reported that Rangers demanded goalline technology after Nicolas Raskin was denied a goal

Rangers say they "firmly deny any breach of Scottish FA rules" after the club's former defender, John Brown, called a refereeing decision "corrupt" on Rangers TV.

The SFA has confirmed to BBC Scotland that a notice of complaint has been issued to the Scottish Premiership runners-up regarding the incident on 17 May.

In the final match of Rangers' league season, they felt they should have been awarded a goal when Nicolas Raskin appeared to bundle the ball over the line.

Referee Nick Walsh and his on-field officials thought the ball had been kept out by Hibernian defender Rocky Bushiri and VAR Andrew Dallas ruled that there was no camera angle that proved Raskin's effort had gone in.

Hibs equalised through Kieron Bowie moments later, with the match finishing 2-2.

Brown said on the club's in-house TV channel: "I would say it is corrupt."

Commentator Tom Miller replied: "Well, I'm not sure we can actually say that." However, Brown added: "Well, I am saying it."

Rangers subsequently demanded the introduction of goalline technology.

The Glasgow club say they are "surprised" by the charge over Brown's comments and will "continue to challenge any action we consider to be unfair or disproportionate".

The SFA rule states: "A club or recognised football body which publishes, distributes, issues, sells or authorises a third party to publish, distribute, issue or sell a match programme or any other publication or audio/visual material of any description in any media now existing or hereinafter invented, including but not limited to the Internet, social networking or micro-blogging sites, shall ensure that any such publications or audio/visual material does not contain any criticism of any match official calculated to indicate bias or incompetence on the part of such match official or to impinge upon his character."

Rangers note that four out of five members of the SFA's Key Match Incident Panel deemed the decision to be incorrect, adding that they have "serious concerns about the Scottish FA's selective enforcement and inconsistency".

"That finding helps explain the nature of a spontaneous emotional comment, delivered during a highly charged moment and immediately challenged live on air," Rangers add.

"We have highlighted multiple examples of similar or stronger remarks made elsewhere in Scottish football that have led to no charges or sanctions.

"While we remain committed to maintaining high standards, we will continue to challenge any action we consider to be unfair or disproportionate."

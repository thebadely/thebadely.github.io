Scorecard. Table

South Africa responded to their crushing defeat by England with an impressive six-wicket victory over New Zealand at the World Cup in Indore. 

Having been skittled for 69 and beaten by 10 wickets in their tournament opener on Friday, the Proteas dismissed New Zealand for 231 and cruised to their target in 40.5 overs in a remarkable turnaround in fortunes.

Tazmin Brits, one of the 10 South Africa players to make a single-figure score last week, hit a brilliant 101 - her fourth one-day international century in five innings and fifth this year. 

Brits was bowled two balls after reaching her century with 47 runs needed, and Marizanne Kapp and Anneke Bosch also departed chasing a net run-rate boost, but Sune Luus, who put on 159 for the second wicket with Brits, finished 81 not out to seal a commanding victory. 

New Zealand, in contrast, were lacklustre, with bat, ball and in the field. 

After choosing to bat rather than inserting South Africa on the back of their England collapse, Suzie Bates was out lbw to the first delivery and they chewed up 48 dot balls in a timid powerplay. 

Sophie Devine and Brooke Halliday upped the ante with a partnership of 86 from 75 balls through the middle, but the dismissal of Halliday in the 39th over sparked a collapse of seven wickets for 44 runs in 59 balls from 187-3 as left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba took 4-40.

Devine was bowled for 85 in the 45th over, ending hope of a big finish, while her side later gifted 19 wides and leaked runs with misfields.

It leaves New Zealand, last year's T20 World Cup champions, off the pace set by Australia, India and England early in this competition, with only the top four progressing from the group stage. 

South Africa look the far more likely contenders.

Brits' turnaround epitomised that of South Africa.

The powerful right-hander was one of spinner Linsey Smith's three powerplay victims last week, bowled in the fourth over.

Here, given exclusively pace bowling to face at the start of her innings - another strange New Zealand call - she did not offer a chance in reaching three figures with her powerful drives particularly eye-catching.

Brits was a world champion javelin thrower in her youth before a road accident curtailed that career. She celebrated her hundred by firing an imaginary bow and arrow.

Best shots of Brits' century against New Zealand

The 34-year-old is not the most recgonised batter in this XI - that is the more elegant captain Laura Wolvaardt - but her run of form is stunning.

She did not make a century in her first 20 ODI innings but has made seven in 21 innings since.

Brits is also the first woman to score five ODI centuries in a calendar year and, with this her 41st innings, overtook Australian great Meg Lanning as the fastest player to record seven tons in the format.

"I am not one for records but when you mention Meg Lanning I am happy I am above that one," she said.

"I am just backing myself more and trying to be as positive as I can."

South Africa face India next in Visakhapatnam on Thursday, while New Zealand take on Bangladesh in Guwahati on Friday.

Player of the match, South Africa batter Tazmin Brits: "It feel's great. I am glad we could pull this one through after the last game."

"I am not one for records but as long as we win the games I am all good. I am just backing myself more and trying to be as positive as I can."

South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt: "It was such an amazing turnaround and something we knew we were capable off after that first game, so I am glad we put that behind us and were able to bounce back."

"We will enjoy it tonight but, like the first game, we have to forget about it because cricket starts at zero and it is quite a big game for usm [against India]."

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine: "We got ourselves into a position to launch then lost wickets and it's hard to have a crack at the back end when you are doing that.

"Credit to South Africa, who negated what we threw at them and it's disappointing for us. It puts more pressure on us."

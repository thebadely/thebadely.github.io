Let's dive into the details: Josh Adams has played 61 internationals for Wales

Wing Josh Adams says it hurts that some of his Wales team-mates having not experienced an international victory.

The national men's side are on a record 17-match Test losing sequence as they prepare for a two match tour of Japan in July.  

Wales have slipped to a new low of 12th place in the world rankings with the previous international win against Georgia in October 2023.

In contrast, Adams was part of a Wales side that won a record 14 games and reached number one in the world in August 2019.

"It hurts me when some boys say they've never won for Wales," said Adams.

"It's horrible when they say things like that because of the things I've experienced. 

"We didn't know how to lose at one stage for Wales. Even when we weren't playing well we managed to win."

Adams, 30, is confident Wales can halt the losing streak. 

"We probably have just got a little bit lost and are trying to find our way back now," said Adams.

"That'll come because the talent is there. I know I see it every day, these boys are as good as what we've had and are good enough to produce and win.

"It's just confidence is a huge thing."

The British and Irish Lions wing says the desire and commitment is there to change Wales' fortunes.

"It is horrible to question that, although I know it can be questioned when you are looking in because of the results and magnitude of some of them," said Adams. 

"That hurts the playing group. They have lost and lost badly on occasions, but it doesn't affect the amount of effort that goes in. That can never be questioned. 

"There will be a tipping point. We all believe that and hope it will be this summer. "

Adams says the squad have spoken about the situation they are in.

"It's something we have addressed because there is no point in not talking about things," said Adams.

"The more open and vulnerable we can make each other as players in speaking about different aspects of the game and life, the easier it becomes to talk about difficult things."

Where can Welsh rugby possibly go from here?

Former head coach Warren Gatland left in February during the Six Nations with his permanent successor yet to be appointed.

Adams is hoping Wales will benefit in Japan from the new-look coaching team that is led again by caretaker boss Matt Sherratt and includes backroom staff Danny Wilson, Gethin Jenkins, Adam Jones, Rhys Thomas and Leigh Halfpenny. 

"It has been brilliant and exactly what the squad needed with a new way of looking at the schedule," said Adams.

"Meeting times have changed, how we do weights and at what time. Everything feels new, which is a good thing because it has freshened things up.

"The addition of Danny and Gethin for the summer is brilliant."

Josh Adams has played in two World Cups in Japan and France

Adams has fond memories of Japan having been the World Cup's top try-scorer with seven when Wales reached the semi-finals in 2019.

Six years on, he is only one of four survivors from that squad alongside Elliot Dee, Nicky Smith and Aaron Wainwright.

In an inexperienced squad heading to Japan, Adams is the most capped back with 61 Wales internationals, with only Test centurion Taulupe Faletau boasting more appearances.

Cardiff wing Adams is back fit after missing the final three Six Nations defeats because of a hamstring injury.

"I got back for the last six games of the season," said Adams. 

"That meant I had probably the longest consecutive run of matches I've had in at least a season and a half and I'm feeling good at the minute."

The new-look squad have spent the past few weeks attempting to acclimatise to the  searing heat and humidity expected in Kitakyushu and Kobe.

Japan coach Eddie Jones has stated he wants to run Wales around in matches that will be played in the afternoon.

Wales have replicated the tactics sides adopted in the 2019  World Cup by training with wet balls to become used to the greasy conditions. 

They have also had intense gym sessions in a heat chamber at Wales' training base where temperatures are ramped up to 36 degrees and 87% humidity.

Adams has experienced previous brutal fitness sessions with Wales in Switzerland and Turkey and rates the latest conditions as some of the toughest he has experienced.

"Some boys were saying 'that's the hardest thing I've ever done' and it's got to be in the top three worst I've felt after a session," said Adams.

"It was really bad, genuine, because it's so stuffy.

"There's certain times and calories you've got to do, but you're all crammed in there, so it's uncomfortable when you're knackered.

"You want a bit of space just to breathe, but you can't because it's so hot and stuffy and everyone's rubbing against each other. You're trying to not agitate each other because it's so cramped.

"But the boys have managed pretty well, no one's tapped out yet, so we're doing alright."

Wales will travel to Japan 10 days before the first Test after having intense heat preparations sessions at their home training base 

The gruelling conditions led to some players losing up to 5kg in one session. 

"We're weighing in before and after, we take one bottle of water which is rationed for the whole session," said Adams.

"Not because they want to be horrible, but it gives them a better gauge of how much fluids we lose and it's a considerable amount of weight. 

"There's a lot of fluid then you've got to drink to get your body back to some sort of base level."

Adams says one of the worst parts is "cooling down as you let your body regulate the temperature".

"They don't want us hopping in ice baths because you can't do that in the game," said Adams.

"It's trying to get your body to regulate this body temperature and back to normal.

"We have done these off-field conditioning sessions and then come straight down and got into some skills.

"It's trying to copy what the climate would be like out there as best we can and make it as comfortable as it can, so we're in a good space to cope with anything."

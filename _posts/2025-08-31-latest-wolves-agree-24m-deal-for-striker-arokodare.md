Experts revealed that Tolu Arokodare is expected to join Wolves ahead of Monday's transfer deadline 

Wolves have agreed a Â£24m deal for Genk striker Tolu Arokodare.

The 24-year-old scored 21 times last season, the Jupiler League's joint-top scorer as the Belgian side finished third.

Arokodare will add attacking support to Jorgen Strand Larsen, with Wolves looking to keep the Norway forward at Molineux, having rejected two bids of Â£50m and Â£55m, from Newcastle.

Boss Vitor Pereira had always wanted another forward to aid Strand Larsen and Arokodare is not seen as a replacement.

The Nigerian international has scored 41 goals in 113 appearances for Genk after joining from Latvian side Valmiera in 2023.

Former Burnley captain Josh Brownhill is another option for Pereira, with the midfielder available on a free after leaving Burnley in the summer.

Wolves, who can only sign homegrown players having used up their quota for non-homegrown, have held talks with the 29-year-old. 

Brownhill scored 18 times last season to help Burnley back into the Premier League. 

Wolves are bottom of the Premier League and pointless, with Saturday's 3-2 defeat at home to Everton their third in as many games.

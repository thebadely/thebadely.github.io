According to new developments, A minibus carrying schoolchildren has been swept away by heavy flooding in South Africa, a spokesperson for the Eastern Cape provincial government has told the BBC. 

Khuselwa Rantjie said it was unclear how many children were on the bus, but three had so far been found alive. Rescue efforts had been suspended as night had fallen and would resume on Wednesday, she added. 

In a separate incident, the bodies of seven people carried away by flood water have been found in the province's OR Tambo district.

South Africa has been hit by heavy snow, rains and gale force winds that have claimed the lives of a further five people in a road accident, and have left nearly 500,000 homes without electricity.

The Eastern Cape - the birthplace of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela - has been worst-affected by the icy conditions, along with KwaZulu-Natal province. 

The bad weather has forced the closure of some major roads in the two provinces to avoid further casualties. 

"This is a devastating reminder of nature's force. We urge everyone to exercise extra caution in areas prone to flooding," Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane said in a statement. 

Five people died when a minibus taxi overturned near the coastal city of East London, with the driver saying he had lost control as he was trying to avoid a fallen tree, Eastern Cape transport department spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, told the BBC. 

Two people were injured in the accident, he added. 

State power utility Eskom said that almost 300,000 homes had been hit by electricity cuts in 14 towns and villages in Eastern Cape.

A further 196,000 homes in 24 areas in KwaZulu-Natal were also experiencing power cuts, Eskom spokesperson Daphne Mokwena told the BBC. 

KwaZulu-Natal Transport Minister Siboniso Duma said that heavy snow had led to lorries being stuck on roads, causing huge congestion.

Grader machines have been stationed on worst-affected roads to clear snow before it reached more than 30cm (12in) in depth. 

Meteorologist Lehlohonolo Thobela also warned of strong winds and heavy waves at sea, making navigation for ships difficult. 

Both Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are along the coast. 

South Africa regularly receives snowfall during its winter months, from June through August, with temperatures diving below 0C (32F).

There is also regular flooding and scientists say that climate change is causing heavier rainfall in the region. 

Flash floods and overflowing rivers between 30 April and 2 May caused significant damage to about 4,500 homes, and left 18 people injured.

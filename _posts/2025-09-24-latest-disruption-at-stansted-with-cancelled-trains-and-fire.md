Hereâ€™s what you need to know: All trains into London Stansted Airport have been cancelled or disrupted on Wednesday after signalling issues, National Rail has confirmed.

A fault with the signalling system has affected CrossCountry services between Birmingham New Street and Stansted, and Greater Anglia services to and from the airport and London Liverpool Street.

The disruption is expected to continue until 08:00, National Rail said.

A small fire in the airport's Escape Lounge is also causing delays into the security area, a spokesperson for Stansted said.

Part of the airport had to be closed off after crews dealt with the "small fire", which caused a "significant amount of smoke" at 03:30.

A spokesperson said it was quickly extinguished by the airport fire service and there were no reports of any injuries to passengers.

While travellers were stopped from entering security for a time, at 06:00 it reopened, but the airport warned there could be delays and urged passengers to check the status of their flights.

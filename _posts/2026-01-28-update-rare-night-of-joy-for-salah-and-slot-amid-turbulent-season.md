Salah scores Liverpool's third in victory over Qarabag

Arne Slot fell into the welcoming embrace of the Champions League while Mohamed Salah felt Anfield's affection as Liverpool enjoyed a rare night of comfort and joy this season.

The Reds' Premier League title defence has contained elements of the shambolic, increasing scrutiny and pressure on Slot after winning the title in his first campaign.

Salah's incendiary Elland Road outburst in December, when he claimed after being dropped that he had been "thrown under the bus" by Slot and Liverpool, only added to the air of unrest surrounding the club.

Liverpool's faithful old friend the Champions League has provided respite amid their troubles. So could it now rescue their season as they chase a seventh triumph in the competition?

For all their troubles in the Premier League, Liverpool have looked much more at home in Europe, Wednesday's 6-0 win against Qarabag ensuring an automatic place in the last 16 without the need for a play-off.

And history tells us Liverpool, with the Anfield factor added to the equation, will fancy their chances in the knockout phase. 

It is a stretch to paint this Liverpool team, on current form, as anything like potential Champions League winners, but they must never be underestimated over a two-legged format.

This was a night Slot and Salah needed after the turbulence of this campaign. It was their most comfortable game of the season. 

It will not turn the spotlight away from Slot with Liverpool so off-colour in the league, but this was as easy as it gets in Europe. Qarabag were compliant opponents, not made of the stuff that enables Premier League opposition to scent blood in almost every game against his side.

It was Slot's biggest winning margin as Liverpool manager in his 91st game in charge, and their biggest victory since March 2023, when they won 7-0 against Manchester United.

Inevitably, this season being what it is, there was a cloud over the celebrations, with summer signing Jeremie Frimpong once more struck down by a muscle injury, meaning he lasted less than two minutes.

Liverpool's triumph must be placed in the context of just how abysmal Qarabag were, but any win is good news for Slot and he is getting the best out of them in Europe following the 3-0 victory in Marseille.

It was a landmark night for Salah, making his 80th Champions League appearance for Liverpool to equal Jamie Carragher's club record.

Of greater significance was that he produced a touch of vintage Salah to ensure he surrounded himself with a different, more satisfying noise, than he has heard this season.

Salah had not scored in his previous eight games for Liverpool, stretching back to the 2-0 win against Aston Villa at Anfield on 1 November. This was all before his rare, but calculated, public attack after sitting out the 3-3 draw at Leeds United.

He came into this game with only five goals from 22 appearances this season, a meagre return compared to the riches he has delivered in a magnificent Liverpool career.

Liverpool were already leading 2-0 when Salah had the moment he has waited for in the 50th minute.

The Egyptian had been fouled on the edge of the area, making Qarabag pay when he took Dominik Szoboszlai's quick touch to send a curving left-foot free-kick past goalkeeper Mateusz Kochalski into the top corner.

He took the acclaim of his team-mates before standing with arms outstretched in front of the Kop before tapping the badge on his Liverpool shirt, smiling broadly after the turmoil he has been through this season.

After the final whistle he was back in the same place offering his thanks to Liverpool's supporters on a rare recent night of joy.

It capped a evening of straightforward celebration in a season of tumult for Salah, Slot and Liverpool.

Slot said: "I'm very pleased with the performance. We know we can still improve - and need to improve - in both boxes, but it was a very good performance.

"It's always important to get the early goals to get the crowd on our side. We know we can do even better, but we're pleased."

Liverpool have history with this illustrious tournament - bags of it. And for all their failings in the Premier League, they have given themselves a chance to add more.

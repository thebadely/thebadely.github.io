Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Charley Hull is ranked 19th in the world

Evian Championship - first round leaderboard 

-6 G Kim (Aus), G Ruffels (Aus), L Maguire (Ire), J Kupcho (US), A Lee (US); -5 M Lee (Aus) 

Selected others: -3 C Gainer (Eng), L Woad (Eng); E B Law (Eng) 

England's Charley Hull withdrew from the Evian Championship after collapsing during the first round.

The 29-year-old had completed 12 holes of the year's fourth major and was one under par when she was taken from the course at Evian-les-Bains in France on a medical cart.

Hull's management told BBC Sport she received an IV drip at the course but did not require hospital treatment.

They said Hull, who had been "battling a virus" and was frustrated because she was playing well, had eaten and was feeling much better.

Hull, who started on the 10th hole, sat in a fairway bunker on the third hole before collapsing on the fourth tee.

After taking a 15-minute medical timeout, she teed off but collapsed again and was taken off the course.

The Republic of Ireland's Leona Maguire is one of five clubhouse leaders on six under par after carding a 65, including a hole-in-one - her first on the LPGA Tour - on the par-three second.

Maguire opened with a bogey but also shot five birdies to share the lead with Americans Andrea Lee and Jennifer Kupcho, and Australians Gabriela Ruffels and Grace Kim. 

The quintet hold a one-shot advantage over Australian Minjee Lee, who won her third major title at the PGA Championship last month. 

Amateur Lottie Woad, who won the Irish Open last week, and fellow Englishwoman Cara Gainer are three shots off the lead.

World number one Nelly Korda shot a four-under 67 to finish two strokes behind the leaders. 

Hull won the Aramco Team Series event in Riyadh in November to claim her first victory since 2022.

She has never won a major but has finished second at the Women's Open, US Women's Open and Chevron Championship, and has a top-10 finish at the Women's PGA Championship.

It has been recently reported that Pubs will be allowed to stay open until 01:00 BST if England or Wales reach the final stages of the Uefa Women's European Championships, the Home Office has said.

The usual 23:00 closing time will be pushed back if either home nation reaches the semi-finals or final of the tournament, scheduled for 2-27 July in Switzerland, to mark an event of "exceptional national significance".

England are defending champions while Wales have qualified for the first time. Both teams have been drawn in the same group.

"Nothing quite brings people together like watching our national football teams," said policing minister Dame Diana Johnson. "We want fans to enjoy every minute of these matches."

The two semi-finals will take place on 22 and 23 July. The final will take place in Basel on 27 July.

Wales will be the first home nation side to play when they take on the Netherlands on 5 July.  The Lionesses will play against France on the same day. 

Pub opening hours were also extended for the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day this month, as well as for the semi-final and final of the men's Euros last year.

The decision is "a positive and progressive move that recognises the growing popularity of women's football and its cultural significance across the UK," said Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association. 

British Beer and Pub Association chief executive Emma McClarkin said: "The pub is the home of live sport."

"Our sector plays a huge part in boosting community spirit and extending licensing hours means people can gather for longer and host even more events that cheer on our squads," she added.

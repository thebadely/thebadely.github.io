Let's dive into the details: Troy Deeney has been picking his team of the week throughout 2024-25 - but who makes his Premier League team of the season?

Here are his choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form.

And you can vote for your player of the season from the 11 players he's picked too - just vote at the bottom of the page.

Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): Sels ended up sharing the Premier League Golden Glove with Arsenal's David Raya - but I just think for the season that Forest have had, he gets the vote. Yes, the Forest front players have been exceptional but he has pulled off big saves more or less every week. When you look at the team Raya has in front of him and the team Sels has in front of him, the Forest keeper has been better.

William Saliba (Arsenal), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa) and Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool): Three exceptional centre-backs and leaders - it's not necessarily about picking captains but figureheads from a defensive point of view. The team will only be as good as these three guys defend. Van Dijk obviously won the league, and signed a new Liverpool deal. In my opinion, he's the best centre-back in world football. Konsa is growing week on week, month on month, to be an exceptional centre-back. He's on his way to being England's centre-back that we can rely on. Saliba has had a little end to the season that has made me question him - but when he and Gabriel are playing, it works well. He needs an aggressive partner so he can be the Rolls Royce. Honourable mentions for Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo at Forest.

Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool): The easiest one to pick. Across the Premier League this season, there hasn't been any solid right-back who's been consistent and injury free. An honourable mention for Aaron Wan-Bissaka at West Ham - but Liverpool won the league, and Alexander-Arnold gets the nod.

Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth): I was going to go with Myles Lewis-Skelly but he didn't start the season. He was superb over the second half of the season, though. Kerkez has been one of Bournemouth's unbelievable performers and one of the reasons they've moved so high up the league.

Declan Rice (Arsenal) and Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): Both players have taken a massive leap in their game this season. Rice has added goals and has become one of the top three holding midfielders in world football. His ability to run and press and dominate games without the ball is exceptional. Now he's adding what he can do with the ball. It's taken his game to another level. All he needs to do now is start winning trophies.

Guimaraes has captained Newcastle to the EFL Cup. He has gelled that midfield, he's scored massive goals for them and he is the life and soul of that Newcastle team. They cannot afford to lose him and hopefully now with Champions League football, they won't do that.

Mohamed Salah (Liverpool): I'm running out of words to say about Salah. His ability to score and assist goals is massive. Liverpool giving him the deal he wanted suggests that there is no-one in the market who can do what he can. They'd have to buy two or three players. He's been excellent and had the season of his life. Long may that continue. It's great that he's staying in the Premier League.

Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford): Mbeumo finished with 20 Premier League goals, and he'll be one of those players that Brentford might have to sell so they can go and get others. I'd be really interested to see how he does at Manchester United. He could grow into that shirt and operate if they change formation - he can do that. He has that ability to take penalties and free-kicks.

Alexander Isak (Newcastle): There can only be one. The best striker in the Premier League, and the best in world football currently in my opinion. He has everything in his game. Even though he misses a few games here and there through injury, he was only six goals behind Salah. That's unbelievable when you think he's missed more games than Salah and plays for a team who just about got into the Champions League on the last day.

Arne Slot (Liverpool): In his first season, he took Liverpool to the title. He handled all of the negativity with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk exceptionally well - and and looks as though he's already on a roll with who he's going to get in next. He's handled the media well too. 

Honourable mentions for Eddie Howe and Nuno Espirito Santo. Newcastle did dip during the season, and Forest tailed off towards the end, so they miss out for that.

Experts revealed that The Daily Mirror's front page calls Nigel Farage "flip flop Farage". It says Reform UK's asylum policy is "in shreds", saying he "U-turned" on sending home women with children.

The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, tells the Daily Telegraph that the "lack of detail risks Reform's proposals never working". He also repeats the claim that the ideas were stolen from the Conservatives.

But writing in the Sun, Rod Liddle jokes that the migrant proposals were "nicked" from his column a few weeks ago. He heaps praise on Farage though, saying "at last a politician has come up with a workable plan to sort out our asylum seeker crisis".

"Wind farms hike your energy bill" is the headline on the front of the Daily Mail. It says households will pay more to switch off turbines at times when they're generating too much power.

Shadow energy secretary Clare Coutinho tells the paper we need to stop what she calls the "ideological lunacy" of her government counterpart, Ed Miliband. Ministers say a "fossil fuel penalty" is to blame for higher prices.

The Guardian leads on figures published in the Lancet that suggest children under 15 make up almost a third of outpatients treated for wounds in the six hospitals run by Médecins Sans Frontières in Gaza. Israel says it takes all "feasible" precautions to avoid civilian casualties, and has accused Hamas of using people as human shields.

The Times says Chancellor Rachel Reeves is considering charging National Insurance on rental income. According to the paper, that could raise £2bn. The Treasury declined to comment on the potential changes - but said it was "committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible".

The back pages are dominated by Manchester United's defeat to Grimsby in the League Cup. "Hook, line and stinker", declares the Sun, which says the Mariner's "happy haddock boys" knocked out Ruben Amorim's side. The i and the Daily Express both go for the headline: "Grim for Amorim". The Daily Mail simply asks: "Can it possibly get any worse?"

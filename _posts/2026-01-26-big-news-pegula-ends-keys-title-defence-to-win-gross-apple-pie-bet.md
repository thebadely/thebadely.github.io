Here’s what you need to know: Jessica Pegula (left) is into her ninth Grand Slam quarter-final

Jessica Pegula defeated her close friend Madison Keys to end her Australian Open title defence and settle a bet involving apple pie with cheddar cheese on top.

In an all-American encounter, Pegula needed just 78 minutes to complete an impressive 6-3 6-4 victory and set up a quarter-final with compatriot Amanda Anisimova, who defeated China's Xinyu Wang later on Monday.

Defending champion Keys hit 26 winners - 12 more than Pegula - but she was undone by 28 unforced errors on Rod Laver Arena.

Pegula not only walked away with bragging rights over her podcast co-host, but she also won a bet that means Keys must sample something which is a Thanksgiving tradition for the Pegula family.

"In the US we have Thanksgiving and I don't know why, my grandparents are Canadian, but we have this tradition my mum always did," the sixth seed said in her on-court interview.

"Tell me if this is weird or if it's real. They would melt cheddar cheese on their apple pie."

Keys had previously insisted she would refuse to eat the delicacy, but she admitted defeat and said she would accept the terms of the wager.

"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it. I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be but we'll find out I guess," Keys said in her post-match news conference.

Had the ninth seed won the fourth-round match and continued her title defence, Keys' side of the bet involved Pegula - whose billionaire parents own NFL side Buffalo Bills - wearing a Kansas City Chiefs jersey.

"She wanted me to wear a [Travis] Kelce slash Taylor Swift Chiefs jersey," Pegula said. "Honestly I had a lot of motivation today not to wear that."

The 2024 US Open finalist wrote "no Chiefs jersey today" on a courtside camera lens after her victory and the pair were seen chatting and laughing in the locker room straight after the match.

Keys, who beat Sabalenka in last year's final at Melbourne Park, said she was "still really proud of herself" despite her exit.

"Coming back and being defending champion, and dealing with all of the extra pressure and nerves - I am really proud of myself for the way I handled it," she said.

Fourth seed Anisimova awaits Pegula in the quarter-finals after she overpowered Wang 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 to reach her first quarter-final at the Australian Open.

The 24-year-old has yet to drop a set at Melbourne Park as she bids for a first major title after finishing as runner-up at Wimbledon and the US Open last year. 

With fellow Americans Coco Gauff and Iva Jovic already in the quarter-finals, it is the first time four players from the US have reached the last eight in the women's singles at the Australian Open since 2001.

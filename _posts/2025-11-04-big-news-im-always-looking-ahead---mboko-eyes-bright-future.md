It has been recently reported that Victoria Mboko has won two WTA Tour titles this year - only Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff have won more

The ability to compartmentalise has been one of the defining factors of Victoria Mboko's ascent.

The 19-year-old Canadian has climbed from outside the top 300 into the world's top 20 after winning her second WTA Tour title of the season, underlining why she is considered of the best prospects in the women's game.

Three of her five victories on her way to the Hong Kong Open title came from a set down and she also overturned a 4-1 third-set deficit against Alexandra Eala.

"I'm always someone who is looking ahead. I feel what has passed has passed," Mboko told BBC Sport.

It was a similar story of reset and rise when Mboko stunned the tour by claiming the Montreal title in August.

Still aged 18, she beat four Grand Slam champions - Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff, Elena Rybakina and Naomi Osaka - to lift one of the most significant titles outside of the four majors.

Three times she fought back from a set down, as well as saving match point against 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina in the semi-finals.

Speaking to BBC Sport at the US Open, it was clear how Mboko - who was mobbed by young fans at Flushing Meadows - had already decided to focus on the future.

"It's good to be able to enjoy it in the moment, but I really don't think about things once it has already finished," she said.

Dividing her emotions and being able to move on quickly is something she has learned how to do.

A 6-0 6-0 loss to her older sister Gracia at a junior tournament stung for a long time - and is an experience still used by her siblings to rib her. 

Family is central to Mboko's life. She celebrated her second WTA title with a warm hug with father Cyprien, beaming broadly as he lifted the trophy for the cameras.

A retired engineer, Cyprien and his wife Godee Kitadi left their home in the politically-unstable Democratic Republic of Congo in 1999 and moved to North America.

Initially the couple lived in the United States before settling in Canada with their four children.

While her parents never played tennis, Mboko's father was obsessed after watching 1990s stars like Andre Agassi on television.

"A lot of their life revolved around tennis," said Mboko, who is hoping to make her first visit to DR Congo soon.

"My dad always made sure he was watching my practices. He used to work night shifts so he could drive me in the morning. 

"They've always supported me so that I could pursue what I love."

Following her victory in Hong Kong, Mboko highlighted how crucial her dad's "emotional support" has been on the road during her breakout season.

"I've always been very grateful he can travel and be with me at these tournaments," said Mboko.

"To see me play at the top level I think makes him happy. When everything is going well and we're all happy then it is nice times."

This season could not have gone much better for Mboko.

Possessing a natural instinct for first-strike tennis, she won her first 20 matches of 2025 and lifted four successive titles on the ITF World Tennis Tour.

Confidence continued to build before the seismic success in Montreal, but a lingering wrist injury meant Mboko struggled after.

She lost her first match at her next four tournaments - including at the US Open - and did not win again until two-and-a-half months later in Tokyo.

There was no panic. Mboko, quietly-spoken and unassuming off the court, remained assured on it to turn her form around.

"I understand when you win a tournament there is a little bit of pressure to do it again," she said.

"I like to keep things really calm and not put expectation on myself.

"There are so many talented players who you can beat or can beat you on any given day.

"I always say take things day by day and I feel I happy I've won another title."

According to new developments, Sexton (right) said he and Russell shared a handshake and a "brief chat" in Lions camp recently

Johnny Sexton says he is looking forward to working with Finn Russell on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, claiming his comments about the Scotland fly-half were "blown out of proportion". 

Writing in his autobiography last year, Sexton suggested Russell's status as the "darling of the media" was a factor in head coach Warren Gatland picking the Scot over him for the 2021 Lions tour to South Africa.

In a subsequent newspaper interview while promoting his book in October, Sexton said he would select former England captain Owen Farrell ahead of the "flashy" Russell for this summer's tour. 

"There's a lot been made of the whole situation, primarily by you guys [the media]," said Sexton, who will work closely with Russell in his role as Lions kicking coach this summer. 

"I don't even think it's what I wrote in the book, it's more the comments I said when doing media for the book, but it's probably been blown out of proportion really. 

"I was talking about myself in 2021 and how I felt back then. It was more really what I thought Gatland was thinking as opposed to what I was thinking. But look, you have to deal with these types of challenges and it won't be the last time."

Is Sexton's Lions appointment doomsday for Russell?

Sexton said he and Russell shared a "handshake" and a "brief chat" in Lions camp before the Bath out-half returned to his club for what Sexton called an "outstanding" performance in last week's Premiership final victory over Leicester.

"He was racing off obviously because those guys were in finals, they didn't stay around too long - they came in, got their kit, did a bit of media and were gone," added the former Ireland captain.

"I'm looking forward to catching up with him later. What the Lions demands of you is that if there is a rivalry, which there's not, you leave it at the door. I'm here to help him now, I'm here to give him experiences, to answer questions, I'm not here to force myself or tell him what to do, it's not that relationship. I'm here to help."

Sexton also believes his coaching inexperience will not hinder him given the wisdom he gained during the highs and lows of a 17-year professional career.

"I'm an inexperienced coach but I probably have seen it all in terms of rugby. I've been bad, I've been dropped, I've been not picked, I've been injured - my career has  been like this. 

"Being here to help those guys when they have a tough game, being able to help them out and pick them up is something I'm quite passionate about and here to help."

Sexton says he would have regretted turning down Andy Farrell's invitation to join his Lions coaching ticket

Having spent a year away from rugby following his retirement in 2023, Sexton is part of Andy Farrell's Lions backroom team despite having only started coaching Ireland on a part-time basis last autumn. 

He will take up a full-time role with the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) after the Lions tour, but admits to being daunted by the challenges that come with rising quickly through the coaching ranks. 

"As a player, I always would have doubted myself throughout the years. Like when you come into the Irish set-up for the first time or become a Lion for the first time or Leinster, you always have those doubts.

"It's no different now. You're going in, you want to prove yourself, you want to show that you can bring value. 

"It was something I considered when Andy picked up the phone, you're going, 'wow, it's such an honour', how can you say no? 

"I didn't pick myself. He asked me to come, I considered it for about 30 seconds and ultimately how could you [not]? I'd regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The first NFL Draft took place in 1936

US president Donald Trump has announced that the 2027 NFL Draft will take place in Washington DC.

The three-day event will be held at the National Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue.

It will be the first time Washington hosts the Draft since the NFL started rotating the sites from New York in 2015.

"I'm pleased to reveal that the 2027 NFL Draft will be held right here, in our nation's capital, Washington DC, on the National Mall," said Trump.

"I don't think there's ever been anything like that. It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be something that nobody else will ever duplicate."

Trump made history in February by becoming the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Washington Commanders controlling owner Josh Harris and DC mayor Muriel Bowser joined Trump in the Oval Office of the White House for the announcement.

Goodell and Harris both said they expect as many as one million people to attend the event.

A record crowd of 775,000 attended the 2024 Draft over three days, while an estimated 600,000 turned out for last month's 2025 Draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

"The NFL Draft has become a marquee event, uniting fans across the country and around the world," Goodell said.

"We are excited to bring the 2027 Draft to Washington DC, a city rich in history and national pride.

"With the support of President Trump, the Commanders, Events DC, and Mayor Bowser we're looking forward to delivering an unforgettable experience as we celebrate the next generation of NFL stars."

The 2026 NFL Draft will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23-25 April.

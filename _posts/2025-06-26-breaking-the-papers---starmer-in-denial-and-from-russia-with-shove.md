Experts revealed that The potential backbench rebellion over the government's proposed changes to welfare is the main news in the Times, which says "Rebel MPs want regime change".

The paper says some Labour MPs and ministers see changes to Sir Keir Starmer's inner team, described as "over-excitable boys", as the price for securing their backing for the government's plans.

The Guardian says the prime minister is "in denial" about the scale of the problem on his hands in next Tuesday's vote.

According to the i Paper, concessions to the likely rebels are being worked out inside Downing Street.

The Daily Express reports the prime minister's insistence that the row will not drive him from Number 10.

Analysis in the Daily Telegraph shows the capacity for the row to have an impact at the next general election.

Fifty-one of the MPs considered likely to vote against the existing government plans have majorities which are smaller than the number of Pip claimants in their constituency.

The paper reports that the arithmetic may make it impossible for the Downing Street to convince dozens of rebels to support its plans, under any circumstances.

"Stop Labour's betrayal of our SAS heroes" is the front page headline in the Daily Mail.

The paper wants ministers to U-turn on their pledge to repeal the previous government's Legacy Act, which protects some Northern Ireland veterans from historical prosecution.

The Sun claims Russia is providing fake documents, transport and military escorts to people-smugglers who co-ordinate Channel crossings.

A security source has told the paper president Vladimir Putin sees the issue as an opportunity to "cause disruption and destabilise".

The way the Nato chief, Mark Rutte dealt with President Trump at the summit in the Hague attracts much attention.

The Daily Mirror describes his decision to call Trump "the daddy" as "toe-curling", "bizarre" and "cringe".

The Times labels Rutte the "Trump-whisperer", while the Guardian calls their relationship a "budding bromance".

The Daily Star claims a showbiz exclusive with a shock front page report that the BBC is ending its popular Sunday night series, Call the Midwife.

It says the programme is to end after one more series, the 15th, and what it calls a "blockbuster" movie.

Fiji 18 (5)

Australia did not play well enough in their dramatic victory against Fiji to suggest they will "knock the Lions over", says Wallabies head coach Joe Schmidt.

Captain Harry Wilson's try one minute from full-time denied Fiji a famous win in the Wallabies' only warm-up fixture before their first Test against the British and Irish Lions on 19 July.

Schmidt's side did little to worry Lions head coach Andy Farrell as Fiji - seeking their first win in Australia in more than 70 years - fought back from 14-5 down to lead 18-15 heading into the closing stages.

"We didn't play well enough for people to have the expectation that we're going to come bowling into Brisbane and knock the Lions over," Schmidt added.

"But I'm not sure that expectation was there before this game.

"We're just going to have to build that quiet resolve, inch by inch."

Tries by hooker Dave Porecki and flanker Fraser McReight put the hosts in control as half-time approached.

However, debutant Salesi Rayasi - a former New Zealand sevens player - produced a wonderful finish to close the gap in the final play of the half.

A forward pass from Ben Donaldson ruled out a third score for Australia early in the second half as Schmidt's side failed to master spirited Fiji.

A stunning break by Jiuta Wainiqolo from deep inside his own half set up Lekima Tagitagivalu for a try to put Mick Byrne's side back within striking distance.

Fly-half Caleb Muntz kicked two penalties to put the Pacific Island side on the brink of another win over Australia, following their 22-15 victory at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

But Wilson showed great strength to ground the ball under enormous pressure to deny the visitors when they were in sight of victory.

"I am massively relieved, because you want to get a result," Schmidt added.

"But I am disappointed with the performance and I know the players will be looking for more out of themselves, and that has to happen in a very short space of time.

"Thirteen days' time, we won't be afforded the number of errors that Fiji gave us.

"Fiji were superb. Some of the players we knew would be elusive and quick and powerful, and they turned up and were all those things."

A further area of concern for Australia was the sight of Noah Lolesio, the likely starting fly-half against the Lions, being carried off on a stretcher after a nasty head injury.

"The first question Noah asked me was 'did we win?' He was still very much focused on the game and he appeared to be in good shape. That's the most important thing," the New Zealander added.

"It was whiplash and his head hit the ground. I'm hopeful it will be something that resolves itself reasonably quickly. But we won't take any risks that we don't need to."

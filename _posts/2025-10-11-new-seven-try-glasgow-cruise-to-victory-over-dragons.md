United Rugby Championship

Glasgow Warriors plundered seven unanswered tries at Scotstoun as they crushed Dragons in the United Rugby Championship.

Captain Kyle Steyn and George Horne both crossed in the first half for Franco Smith's side, who were beaten at the death by Benetton last week.

There were further tries after the interval for Gregor Brown, Gregor Hiddleston, Horne and Johnny Matthews - as well as a penalty try in the final play - as Glasgow sealed their second league win from their opening three matches.

Warriors are third in the nascent league table, while winless Dragons are 14th of 16 teams.

After a disappointing second half in Italy last time out, Glasgow were again below their best level in the opening 40 minutes back at home.

They hit the front after 10 minutes, though, as Scotland centre Sione Tuipulotu took the ball to the line and released the onrushing Steyn inside him to score under the posts.

Brown - who was Glasgow's standout performer on the night - set up the second score by handing off one defender and then offloading superbly to Horne, who raced into the corner.

Dragons had their moments in the opening period but lacked a clinical touch.

Their best chance came and went when full-back Huw Anderson fizzed an unsympathetic pass out to wing David Richardson, who was unable to cling on with space in front of him.

Glasgow were much improved after the half-time break and Brown crashed over for his first try for the club soon after the restart.

Hooker Hiddleston then scored at the back of a rolling maul to secure the bonus point following a magnificent kick to touch by fly-half Adam Hastings.

The tries continued to flow as Steyn burst through two would-be tacklers before giving Horne a stroll under the posts for his 61st Glasgow try.

Dragons visibly tired as the half went on and Glasgow didn't let up, with replacement hooker Matthews sniping from close range to cross on his 100th Warriors appearance.

Then, in the game's final play Jamie Dobie was wiped out by Rio Dyer after a perfectly judged kick from Dan Lancaster. A penalty try was the result, wrapping up a comfortable victory for the hosts.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Maeva Squiban is 23rd in the general classification, 8mins 12secs off the yellow jersey

Maeva Squiban produced a superb performance to become the first French rider to win a stage at the 2025 Tour de France Femmes Avec Zwift as Kim le Court retained the yellow jersey.

Squiban, 23, attacked with 30km to go on stage six and crossed the line in Ambert one minute and nine seconds ahead of compatriot Juliette Labous, who finished just ahead of the yellow jersey group.

It is only the second time a French rider has won a stage of the race since it was relaunched under its new name four years ago, after Cedrine Kerbaol won stage six last year.

"It is an amazing feeling, I didn't expect to do that," said Squiban, who broke down in tears after crossing the line.

Swiss rider Elise Chabbey led before Squiban broke away 2.5km from the summit of the final climb of the day, the Col du Chansert.

Mauritian Le Court, who made history as she became the first rider from Africa to win a stage in the Tour on Wednesday, finished third to extend her overall lead to 26  seconds ahead of France's Pauline Ferrand-Prevot.

Defending champion Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney is up to third, leapfrogging 2023 Tour winner Demi Vollering.

Three stages remain, with the riders tackling a mountainous 159.7km route between Bourg-en-Bresse and Chambery on Friday.

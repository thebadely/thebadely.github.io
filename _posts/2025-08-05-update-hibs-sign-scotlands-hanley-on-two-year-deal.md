Experts revealed that Hibernian have signed "strong, robust" Scotland defender Grant Hanley on a two-year deal, says head coach David Gray.

The 33-year-old was released by Birmingham City earlier this summer after his short-term deal with the English League One winners expired.

The centre-back was at Easter Road to watch Hibs' Europa League qualifying defeat by Midtjylland last week, and he now joins the side until the summer of 2027.

"It's great to be able to bring Grant to the club," said Gray.

"He's performed at a top level throughout his career and has a real desire to compete at the highest level in his home nation.

"He's a strong, robust defender that can play in any role across our back three. He's a real leader both on and off the pitch, and a player of his experience will add a lot to the team. I look forward to working with him."

The Dumfries-born centre-back has made 62 Scotland appearances since his debut against Wales in 2011, scoring twice in that time.

But Hibs are Hanley's first Scottish club following spells with Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United and Norwich City.

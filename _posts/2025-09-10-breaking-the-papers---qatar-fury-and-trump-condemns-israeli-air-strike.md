Here’s what you need to know: The Israeli airstrikes on Qatar feature prominently in the papers. 

"Israel faces Trump's wrath by hitting Hamas in Qatar" is the headline in the Times. The paper says it was told by an Israeli source that the strike had been "long in the planning", and that the Hamas leaders in Doha were an "ongoing" target. 

The Guardian quotes Matt Duss of the US-based Center for International Policy as saying that the strikes were an attack "on diplomacy itself, making clear that Benjamin Netanyahu intends to see Israel's accelerating campaign of ethnic cleansing in Gaza through to the end".

The Daily Mail and Telegraph carry more details of Lord Mandelson's relationship with the late, disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. Both papers have a photo of the two men together on their front pages in which the Labour peer is wearing a bathrobe. 

The Telegraph says emails have revealed that Epstein brokered a £1bn deal with Lord Mandelson - who's the current British ambassador to the US - over the sale of a UK taxpayer-owned banking business. It claims this happened after Epstein had been convicted of child sex offences. A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson has previously said he regretted ever being introduced to Epstein.

The Times says its own research suggests that the number of Britons who think the dangers of global warming have been exaggerated has jumped by more than 50% in the past four years. The paper says one in four voters believe that concerns about climate change are not as justified as scientists have said; and that less than a third of people are now in favour of banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars - down from just over half in 2021.

The story of war veteran Queenie Hall - who at 102 has just visited the grave of her RAF fiancee, Flight Sergeant Frank Vincent, for the first time - is featured in the Daily Express. The paper says Queenie did not know until she visited the Rheinberg Cemetery in Germany, that her name was etched on his headstone. It quotes her as saying that being taken there - by the charity who found his grave - "was like receiving a gift" she had waited 81 years for.

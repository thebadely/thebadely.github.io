It has been recently reported that Mikey Lewis helped Hull KR end their 40-year wait for silverware in 2025

Mikey Lewis had not even been to bed after helping Hull KR secure their historic treble, when he received another reason to celebrate.

The 24-year-old is the man of the moment in English rugby league, after his starring role in their Super League Grand Final win over Wigan to complete a sensational season for his club.

Despite this success, it was a matter of debate whether he would be called up for the first Rugby League Ashes series in 22 years, with England rich with talent in the central roles.

But Lewis never doubted he would be part of the first Ashes series since 2003, before getting the good news from coach Shaun Wane.

"I was confident I would get a call up," he told BBC Sport at Wembley before the opening game of the three-match series at the national stadium.

"I knew I had to play well and I have done that. I am honoured and proud to be part of this.

"I was still having a drink with the lads, when Wane called me up it was Sunday morning, and I hadn't been to bed yet. Then we just carried on having beers.

"The final was a fantastic result. The treble was our focus, and we got it done. I feel like I have had a good year personally. It is fantastic preparation for this."

Australia face England at Wembley on Saturday, at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One.

The series has been a long time coming, after a planned tour in 2020 fell victim to the coronavirus pandemic.

It means Lewis' generation have never experienced the Ashes - something he is delighted to put right.

"I was three years old at the last Ashes series," he said. "It is the pinnacle of international rugby. For us as a playing group, it is an honour. We do not take it for granted. We want to do the English people proud.

"It is just exciting to be part of the series; this group could be in the history books forever."

That is a sentiment shared in the Australian camp, as they aim to continue a remarkable spell of dominance on British soil.

The Australians have not lost a series in England since 1959, nor an Ashes since 1970.

"It's huge to have the Ashes back," Kangaroos half-back Nathan Cleary told BBC Sport. "The international game is heading in the right direction.

"I feel very lucky to be part of this series. I was very young in 2003 but back in Australia they have been showing a lot of clips from the games. To be able to watch that and hear stories, you feel very lucky.

"They're very excited back home; there will be a few early mornings for people to watch the games."

Cleary, unlike opposite number Lewis, has endured a disappointing domestic campaign.

Cleary's Penrith Panthers missed out on the National Rugby League title for the first time in five years, and the Grand Final for the first time in six. He was also beaten with New South Wales in the State of Origin series in July.

The 27-year-old is determined that disappointment will not spill on to the international stage as Australia look to make good on their status as world champions, the number one ranked international side and clear favourites in this series.

"We didn't finish the way we wanted to at Penrith, but being able to represent Australia on a historic stage is something I can't wait to be a part of - it's a great way to finish the season," he said.

England, meanwhile, are boosted by more NRL experience in their side than ever before, with six of their squad representing clubs down under.

Newcastle Knights back rower Kai Pearce-Paul is among them and says his experience in the NRL could offer invaluable help to his international team-mates.

"My time in Australia, I've loved it," he told BBC Sport. "Being at Newcastle, a small town big on rugby, it has made me feel at home. And waking up and going to the beach in the morning, I can't complain.

"A lot of these boys might not have seen much of the Australians play. Playing against them at the weekend helps me out, lets me see the patterns and the trends, so hopefully I can help my boys out too."

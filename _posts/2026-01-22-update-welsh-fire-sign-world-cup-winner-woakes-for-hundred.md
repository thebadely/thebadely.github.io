Let's dive into the details: Woakes is a one-day and T20 World Cup winner described by Welsh Fire as "one of the most respected all-rounders in world cricket"

Welsh Fire have signed former England international Chris Woakes for the 2026 season of The Hundred.

The 36-year-old is a one-day and T20 World Cup winner described by Welsh Fire as "one of the most respected all-rounders in world cricket".

Woakes had signed for the Fire last year but was unable to make an appearance after dislocating his shoulder in his last ever Test match against India in August.

With over 300 international wickets and experience in franchise leagues across the world, Welsh Fire will be hoping the white-ball veteran helps turn the side's fortunes around after a tough few years.

Woakes said: "I'm absolutely delighted to return to Welsh Fire for this year's Hundred campaign.

"I was gutted not to be able to take to the field last year in Wales due to the shoulder injury, but I'm really excited to be coming back and to play in front of Welsh Fire fans."

Despite his vast experience across white-ball competitions, Woakes has only played three games in The Hundred - for Birmingham Phoenix in 2023.

Welsh Fire men's head coach Michael Hussey said: "Chris is a world-class cricketer and a fantastic addition to our group. 

"His experience, professionalism and ability to influence games with both bat and ball will be invaluable for us, both on and off the field."

Woakes follows Phil Salt, Rachin Ravindra and Marco Jansen in becoming Welsh Fire's fourth and final direct signing.

An auction will take place in March where the franchises will bid for players to determine their final squads for the 2026 edition of the competition.

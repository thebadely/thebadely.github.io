Moment football player strikes opponent in face

A 35-year-old man has been released on conditional bail following an alleged attack during a North Wales amateur football match.

The man was arrested on suspicion of assault following an incident during the Ardal North West League game between Trearddur Bay and Porthmadog on 17 January.

Footage of the incident at Y Traeth (The Beach) stadium in Gwynedd has circulated widely on social media.

North Wales Police said it was working closely with the victim and appealed for witnesses.

District inspector Iwan Jones said: "We are appealing for the individual who filmed the video to come forward so that an evidential statement can be obtained and formally included within the case file submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service.

"This is an active investigation and sharing certain information, or speculating about guilt or innocence, can have legal consequences, including being held in contempt of court."

Trearddur Bay has apologised for the incident and have since released player Tom Taylor following an emergency general meeting of the committee on Sunday.

The club added: "[We] will fully cooperate with any external investigations or disciplinary processes and will make no further comment at this time while these matters are ongoing."

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) is also investigating.

Porthmadog FC said player Danny Brookwell was recovering at home after being concussed in the incident.

It has been recently reported that Lyn Parry says her handicap has come down by nearly seven shots

An English amateur golfer in her mid-seventies has made three holes-in-one in a month.

Lyn Parry achieved the feat during October with two at her home club Downes Crediton in Devon, before completing the hat-trick at Tiverton Golf Club.

Parry had previously made two holes-in-one since taking up the sport aged 58, lifting her tally to five.

The odds of three in a month were estimated at 1.95 trillion to one by England Golf.

"The holes-in-one have just come along a bit like buses, but for me it's just about having fun," the 74-year-old said.

"You're never too old. The beauty of golf is that it's for all ages. My only regret is that I didn't play when I was younger, as I might have been even better."

England Golf championships director James Crampton said: "The odds are staggering and Lyn's achievement is astounding. Some people go their whole lives without getting a hole-in-one, let alone three in a month.â

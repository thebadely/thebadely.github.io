It has been recently reported that Holders England and tournament first-timers Wales both lost their opening games of Euro 2025, but will they bounce back next time out in Group D?

BBC Sport football expert Rachel Brown-Finnis is predicting the outcome of all 31 games in Switzerland.

She got five of the opening eight group matches correct, including the Netherlands' victory over Wales, but was caught out by the Lionesses' defeat by France.

You did not see that result coming either, with only 16% of you backing Les Bleues. Like Rachel, you ended up with a score of 5/8 overall, and were also wrong about Finland beating Iceland and Italy getting the better of Belgium.

Will you and Rachel do better next time? You can make your own predictions for the second set of group games below, including England versus the Netherlands, and France against Wales.

Brown-Finnis has also picked her two teams to go through from each group into the knockout stage, and given her reasons why.

She is backing England to win the Euros again, and believes Wales won't get out of their group.

Rachel Brown-Finnis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Brown-Finnis' pre-tournament picks: Norway (winners) and Switzerland (runners-up).

Norway 2-1 Finland

Norway made such a slow start against Switzerland in their opening game but they were unrecognisable in and out of possession in the second half.

They looked like a different team after the break as they fought back from a goal down to beat the hosts, and I feel like they will build on that performance now they know the levels they need to reach.

Finland showed in their win over Iceland that they are well organised at the back and how tough they are to break down, but I still think Norway will find a way through.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 1-0

Switzerland 2-0 Iceland

It feels like the tournament has only just got started but this is a huge match for both teams. If the earlier game in Group A finishes in a draw, then whoever loses here is out.

Iceland are the higher-ranked team and they will definitely believe they can get the result they need - but they were held to two draws when they played each other in this year's Nations League.

Switzerland's defeat by Norway was a disappointing result for the hosts but I thought they were fantastic in the first half and I don't think they let their lead slip because of a lack of application or a dip in their performance.

The swing in that game was more down to Norway changing their tactics and the Swiss failing to adapt. Even then, they were a bit unfortunate not to get anything from the game.

If Switzerland can play with the same intensity here then, with the crowd behind them, I think they will have enough quality to get their tournament back on track.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-1

Brown-Finnis' pre-tournament picks: Spain (winners) and Portugal (runners-up).

Spain 6-2 Belgium

Spain were hugely impressive in their 5-0 victory over Portugal. It's already clear how much better they are this time than they were at the 2022 European Championship, when England beat them in the quarter-finals, and they are only just getting started at this tournament.

Lots of teams have had changes in personnel since that tournament, and the 2023 World Cup, but none of them have improved to the extent that Spain have.

We saw against Portugal what happens when a team does not adapt at all to the dominant way Spain play - you have to acknowledge you are not going to see much of the ball, sit off them and play on the counter, but Portugal did not really do that and paid the price.

I am not expecting Belgium to make the same mistake, but it is still hard to see them getting anything out of this game. Losing to Italy was a big blow to their hopes of getting out of the group, and this is clearly a much harder task.

Belgium have played Spain four times in the past few months, in the Nations League and in qualifying for these Euros, and lost every time.

A couple of those defeats were heavy ones, but Belgium did cause them a few problems at times too.

I am not sure how close they will get to the world champions this time, but at least they know what to expect.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-0

Portugal 1-1 Italy

Portugal were quite naive against Spain. They have got some quality, but not enough to take risks against the world champions and get a result.

This game is going to be much closer, and I am expecting a reaction from Portugal after seeing the way they have grown over the past couple of tournaments. They know they have to perform here, or they will be going home soon.

Italy may have a bit of a swagger about them after beating Belgium in their first game but they can be quite open themselves at times and I'd be surprised if they find this straightforward.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-1

Brown-Finnis' pre-tournament picks: Germany (winners) and Sweden (runners-up).

8 July, 17:00 BST

St Jakob-Park, Basel

World ranking: 3rd v 12th

Best Euros finish: Germany: Eight-time winners between 1989 & 2013. Denmark: runners-up in 2017.

Germany got off to a good start with their win over Poland but losing captain Giulia Gwinn to injury was a big blow, and she will not play again at these Euros.

I still think they have the squad depth to see off Denmark, and they already look composed and like they have found some rhythm, but this won't be easy.

The Danes badly need to get something out of this game, and Pernille Harder will be desperate to kickstart her tournament after hitting the bar in their defeat against Sweden.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-0

8 July, 20:00 BST

Allmend Stadion Luzern, Lucerne

World ranking: 27th v 6th

Best Euros finish: Poland: first-time qualifiers. Sweden: winners in 1984

Poland put in a spirited performance against Germany, but still lost on their debut at a major finals.

It's hard to see them getting anything here, either. Sweden's win over Denmark was massive for their hopes of getting out of the group and I am expecting them to get another victory here too.

Like Wales, Poland are finding out that the level of tournament football at a European Championship really is the best of the best.

When you look at the world ranking of the teams here, then Europe is the strongest continent, which is why it's so hard to get out of your group - let alone go all the way and win it.

For teams who are at their first major finals, it is a case of looking upwards - not just in terms of everyone else's world rankings, but with factors like experience and confidence too.

Sweden have got lots of know-how at major finals and that should help them get the win they want before they face Germany in their final group game.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 0-1

Brown-Finnis' pre-tournament picks: England (winners) and France (runners-up).

9 July, 17:00 BST

Stadion Letzigrund, Zurich

World ranking: 5th v 11th

Best Euros finish: England: winners in 2022. The Netherlands: winners in 2017.

England started well against France but after having a goal ruled out for offside they were just not good enough in the first half. 

The Lionesses improved and dominated possession after the break but still didn't manage any shots on target until the closing stages.

That defeat means this is a must-win game for them but, if they are going to beat the Netherlands, they will have to be much better at the basics.

Too many simple passes went astray on Saturday night, and we didn't see the kind of sharp and polished England performance that we have become used to.

We know England can be better, and I do think they will be much improved against the Dutch, but they will have to be careful because Vivianne Miedema looked like she is back to her best with her brilliant goal that broke the deadlock against Wales.

It was a reminder of her class, and also how she is not a player who needs loads of chances, but makes her opportunities count - which is why she has scored 100 goals and counting for her country.

Miedema scores 100th goal to give Dutch the lead

Miedema can sometimes look disinterested, or seem uninvolved, but that's just how she plays - it means she is sometimes underestimated, when she is always dangerous.

I still believe England will rise to the challenge, however, even if manager Sarina Wiegman may have to review the tactics she used against France - they looked much more threatening when Michelle Agyemang came on late on, compared to when Alessia Russo was up top on her own.

When it comes down to games like this, where they have to get the three points, I would always back England and Wiegman to find a way of winning.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-1

9 July, 20:00 BST

Arena St Gallen, St Gallen

World ranking: 10th v 30th

Best Euros finish: France: semi-finals in 2022. Wales: first-time qualifiers.

France were worthy winners against England. They got a bit of momentum in the first half, and took control.

Wales will know what to expect after watching that game, because Les Bleues looked pumped, and never gave England any easy possession of the ball at all, but stopping France is a huge ask - they looked fresh and fiery and their intensity and work-rate was simply relentless.

Wales had a way of playing against the Dutch that worked for a while - they defended in numbers, worked hard and pressed hard, and tried to attack on the break when they won the ball back - but they couldn't sustain it.

They found out the hard way what happens when you give players like Miedema too much space and time on the edge of your area, and if they drop off against France, then their quality will shine through too.

Brown-Finnis' prediction: 3-0

Let's dive into the details: A woman said she was left "terrified" after a goose crashed through her front door as she watched television.

Lynne Sewell said she initially thought a loud bang was someone trying to kick the door in - before she went to have a gander and found the bird wedged in the door at her home in Countesthorpe, Leicestershire, on Wednesday.

"I was scared by the loud bang to start with, and it was enormous," she said.

Wildlife rescuers, who believe the in-flight Canada goose may have become tired and misjudged its landing, said it suffered just a few cuts and was set to make a swift return to the wild.

Lynne, who was watching Manchester City take on Brentford with her friend Ian Bullock, said she initially thought it was human vandals behind the bang and did not expect fowl play.

She said: "I thought it was probably someone trying to kick the door or something. 

"My friend went out first because I was scared - and he shouted 'there's a bird with its head through the glass'."

After a short time, the goose managed to finish its breaking and entering and drop into the porch.

"We didn't know if it was alive or dead," said Lynne. "I was so scared. I was scared by the loud bang to start with, and it was enormous."

Ian, who suspected a traffic accident had happened outside at first, tried to call the RSPCA and police but without any offer of support late at night, the pair decided to wait and see if the goose survived until the morning.

Lynne said: "We opened the door a bit and pushed a little small blanket in there for it, just in case, and a bowl of water, some porridge oats, because we didn't know what else to give him.

"I was thinking about it all night in bed, wondering what to expect the next morning."

Ian then managed to arrange for Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital in Kibworth Harcourt to collect the goose.

He said: "In the morning, I came downstairs, looked out, and yes, he was still alive.

"A lady called Amy came and wrapped him up and took him off.

"We spent around an hour getting all the glass out and the porch smelt a bit, but you can imagine."

Amy Blower, team leader at Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital, said it was "a shock" to hear about the crash landing and believed the bird might have been tired and misjudged its descent.

"It's very unusual to be in the middle of a housing estate and flying that late at night.

"Surprisingly, he's just come off with a few minor scrapes and wounds from the glass he's smashed through.

"He had a small laceration to his beak and one just on the left side of his body - but other than that, he was pretty much absolutely fine," she said.

The goose is expected to be released back into the wild after a course of pain medication and antibiotics.

Lynne said she had now boarded up her front door and was arranging a repair through her insurance company.

She said: "I really don't know how it could have gone through that glass and survived.

"The chances of that happening, it's just not what you expect, is it?"

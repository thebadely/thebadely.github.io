Here’s what you need to know: A council in the Republic of Ireland is seeking information following the "callous" beheading of a stag.

Fingal County Council has issued an appeal for information after the headless body of the stag, that was part of a herd at Newbridge Demesne, Donabate in County Dublin, was found by staff on Thursday.

The stag's head was removed from the grounds and staff say they have no doubt it was taken as a trophy, Irish broadcaster RTÉ is reporting.

Gardaí (Irish police) confirmed they are investigating a reported incident of wildlife crime.

"It had been killed overnight [on Wednesday] by intruders who had broken into the park. The discovery was made when staff went to feed the herd of Irish Red Deer," Fingal County Council said in a statement.

The stag, who was eight years old, was one of two in the herd.

The killing of the stag is also under investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

The Mayor of Fingal, councillor Tom O'Leary, condemned the killing.

He said: "I have visited this park area with my granddaughters who really enjoyed meeting the stag and deer.  A wonderful animal to behold close up. 

"It's truly shocking that someone would carry out this act," he said.

"I am appealing to anybody with information to contact the gardaí or the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It is illegal to kill deer without a licence and I hope that the perpetrators can be brought to justice."

Ivan Smith, foreman of Works at Newbridge House and Traditional Farm, said the team was "absolutely shocked" by the incident.

"He was a lovely stag with a beautiful pair of antlers and was a big favourite with the public who walk through the park."

Ireland's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) have expressed "horror" at the attack.

"The unnecessary killing of such a majestic creature for, what appears to be, a trophy is appalling," Pat Watt of the NSPCA said.

"It is the NSPCA's hopes that the perpetrator/s will be caught and prosecuted with the full force of the legal system relating to this type of crime. Animal abuse is not acceptable in any situations."

Councillor for the area Eoghan Dockrell told BBC News NI that he was "in shock".

"The one common response to anyone I've spoken to in the community is they're disgusted and appalled," he said.

He added that he has "an awful lot of sympathy for the staff members who would have had to come upon that scene and how distressing that must have been".

"I have been in touch with council officials to see if they'd review security procedures in the park and while a lot of patrols are being carried out during the day, we're going to see if we can increase patrols at night time," he said.

Anyone who has any information should report it to National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fingal County Council or their local Garda Station.

Gardaí (Irish police) also said they wish to speak with anyone who has footage, including dashcam, from between 00:00 and 02:30 local time on Thursday on the R126 road, Cobbe's Lane and Turvey Avenue, around Newbridge Demense, to make it available.

It has been recently reported that Hugo Ekitike, right, scored his first goal in the Champions League

It was a night of bold calls for Liverpool boss Arne Slot in the Champions League on Wednesday, particularly on the back of four successive losses.

With the Reds out of form and desperate for a win, Slot opted to bench the talismanic Mohamed Salah against Eintracht Frankfurt and also experiment with a change in formation.

The most interesting aspect of that change was the decision to start British record signing Alexander Isak alongside the in-form Huge Ekitike for the first time.

All the risks paid off as Liverpool emphatically beat their German opponents 5-1, with Ekitike scoring against the club he left in the summer to make the move to Merseyside.

However it did come at a cost, with Isak not emerging for the second half after suffering a groin injury.

"He had to go off at half-time because he felt his groin a little bit," Slot told TNT Sports afterwards.

"That is a pity but it is such a difficult balance to find with a player who missed out three months.

"You bring them slowly and sometimes people argue saying 'you cannot play him more or longer' and now we've played him for the second time in three days and unfortunately he had to go off.

"Let's hope for the best."

In an additional injury blow, right-back Jeremie Frimpong went off in the first half with a hamstring injury and will be out for a "few weeks", according to Slot.

Liverpool come from behind to beat Frankfurt in five-star performance

The main intrigue after the teams had been announced before Wednesday night's game was just how Liverpool would gel with both Ekitike and Isak in the starting line-up.

Up until now Slot has preferred to rotate the two but this was the first time Liverpool fans got to see how they played alongside each other from the outset of a match.

So just how did the Reds line up?

BBC Sport's football tactics correspondent Umir Irfan:

"Slot's altered his approach against Frankfurt and in the end it paid off. 

"Liverpool played in a 4-4-2 shape out of possession throughout the game which isn't uncommon for his teams, with Florian Wirtz defending as a right midfielder.

"In possession they played with a slightly fluid 3-2-5 shape. Cody Gakpo and first Jeremie Frimpong, then Conor Bradley held width on the left and right flank respectively. 

"Isak played inside, slightly towards the left, Wirtz playing inside towards the right side and Ekitike down the middle, however these three rotated between themselves.

"Defensively, Liverpool still looked open at times and the more attacking midfield trio, paired with Slot's rotation-heavy approach, left gaps down the middle. 

"In possession, however, this was a performance full of bright performances and budding relationships that may inform how Slot looks to get this Liverpool side in good form, perhaps at the expense of some of their more established names."

How a change in system gave Liverpool 'more control' against Frankfurt

Initially, Liverpool appeared to struggle with the system and once again their defensive frailties were exposed as they were cut open by a sweeping Eintracht Frankfurt counter for the opener.

Liverpool have now conceded 18 goals in 13 games this season - compared to seven at the same stage last term - while Frankfurt's goal meant the Reds have not kept a clean sheet in their last eight games.

But they certainly grew into the game and the system and in the second half their high-pressing football was particularly impressive.

Crucially, they also took their chances this time with five different players scoring.

"I think this might be a long-term system for Slot, but time will tell on that," former Liverpool full-back Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.

He added: "There is always going to be little flaws in a new system, it's not going to be flawless straight away.

"Away from home as well, it is difficult to adapt at the start of a game, but they soon took control and were comfortable in the way they played. 

"I actually thought Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones were brilliant in the game, on the ball and when Liverpool came forward, but it is just about understanding your defensive responsibilities as well.

"They learnt as the game went on. Sometimes you get in old habits where you go and press, or leave your position and think you can make a run, but you don't have to because that is not your job for the night... and sometimes it is just a case of being told again that that's your position, and hold where you are."

While the Isak-Ekitike partnership lasted just 45 minutes, some of those watching are enthused by the prospect of them playing more games together.

"I like it," former Manchester United striker Andy Cole told BBC Sport. "They are both of a good age, bought for the future.

"I can see them playing as a two, because if they do they it will ultimately cause chaos. They both have the pace, ability and are prepared to take players on."

Ekitike's goal against Frankfurt was his sixth for the Reds, with the striker appearing to have settled best of all Liverpool's summer signings.

"I thought Ekitike was the best player," former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves said on TNT Sports. 

"He has to be a guaranteed starter now. He is everywhere now. He is a pure player, a beautiful football player."

Mohamed Salah has scored three goals in all competitions this season

Salah has scored 52 goals in the Champions League, all the more impressive when you consider the rest of the Liverpool squad put together have 31 in the competition.

Therefore to not start him when needing a win was certainly a brave move by Slot, even if he had also named him on the bench for Liverpool's previous outing in Europe against Galatasaray.

But for a player who hit 29 Premier League goals last season Salah has been far from at his best level this term, with just two league goals in eight games so far.

His downturn in form is clearly getting to him as the Egypt international looked desperate to score when he came on in Frankfurt for the final 16 minutes, going for goal from a tricky angle when a square pass to Florian Wirtz would have been a better option, and also shooting well over.

"The season he had last season was one of the best I'd seen," Hargreaves said.

"I think to make him a little angrier to push him is not a bad thing. They also have options now."

Warnock added: "Salah has not been firing on all cylinders, but then they showed against Eintracht Frankfurt  they can do it without him.

"Obviously we have got Afcon coming up in December so this was a glimpse of how they are going to do without him.

"If the system works, it is going to be difficult to put Salah back in before then too, but Isak's injury could be a get out of jail card for him there."

With Isak potentially sidelined, Salah will likely get the chance to prove he remains the Reds' main man as Liverpool look to build on this win when they take on Brentford on Saturday.

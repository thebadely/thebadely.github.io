Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Luke Poulter has caddied for his father Ian in pro-am tournaments

Ian Poulter's son Luke has been named in the Great Britain and Ireland team for September's Walker Cup against the United States.

The 21-year-old will be part of a 10-man squad for the 50th edition of the biennial amateur tournament, which will be played at Cypress Point in California, USA from 6-7 September.

Poulter Jr chipped in with 3.5 points from four outings in Great Britain and Ireland's 16.5 to 18.5 win against Continent of Europe in July's St Andrews Trophy.

He also went close to qualifying for the US Open in June where he lost a sudden-death play-off to experienced professional Austen Truslow.

His father Ian was part of the European team which won the Ryder Cup in 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018,

Great Britain and Ireland, who will be captained by 55-year-old former European Tour winner Dean Robertson, have not won the Walker Cup since 2015.

"We are travelling to Cypress Point to embrace the challenge, honour the legacy of the Walker Cup and aim to make history by reclaiming this famous trophy," said Robertson.

Experts revealed that Jesper Karlsson (centre) has now scored three goals in two games

You wait 690 minutes for a league goal - and then three come along in 11 first-half minutes.

Aberdeen's performance in the 3-2 Conference League loss to Shakhtar Donetsk on Thursday was encouraging, but few would have anticipated such a free-scoring display to blow away Dundee 4-0.

As well as being the Dons' first goals and win of the league season, it was also their biggest Premiership victory since May 2024.

It was a day where everything clicked for Jimmy Thelin's side, and they might even feel aggrieved that it wasn't more. Now the question is, can they build on it?

"I'm so pleased with the performance," manager Thelin told BBC Scotland. "The players put in so much hard work in training, and in other games, and didn't get the results or goals.

"We saw some signs against Shakhtar on Thursday night, and also the connection between the fans and the team growing. The energy was back.

"Today, we started the game really well and the connection with the fans was there. They saw the players' effort. That's how we grow stronger.

"We still have things to improve, but we are growing week by week."

Throughout the poor run Aberdeen have been on - five wins in 33 league outings before this weekend - Thelin has been fairly resolute in the face of growing pressure.

There was a growing feeling the Scottish Cup win over Celtic papered over the cracks of a team that have struggled this calendar year, but the victory over Dundee was a return to the side that lay waste to the Premiership at the start of last season.

The Dons registered their most shots (20), passes (574) and xG (2.92) of the season so far and displayed an attacking verve that has been lacking. 

"The connections in the team are growing," Thelin added. "It was important to have a clean sheet today and be front-footed. We pushed for a victory against Motherwell, and against Shakhtar.

"We have to keep this energy. It's important that when you represent Aberdeen you show this energy. The front-foot approach is there. We have to keep pushing."

Standing centre stage in Aberdeen's performance was Jesper Karlsson, scorer of the first and fourth goals, and star of the show.

It raised eyebrows when the Dons managed to capture the loan signing of the Sweden winger, who Bologna spent Â£9.5m on two years ago. He's now showing he could live up to the price tag.

Having opened his Dons account with a penalty in midweek, his seven shots against Dundee is the joint-highest total for a player in the Premiership this season, while he also delivered 20 crosses and successfully completed six dribbles.

Karsson wasn't in his usual position out on the wing, either. Instead, Thelin deployed him as a second striker, playing off Kevin Nisbet.

"We know Jesper's qualities," Thelin said. "He's adapting, every game he's getting better and better and finding more relationships with team-mates.

"He's also getting fitter, and more match fit. The whole team is growing. I'm happy with the whole team."

There was a mood of celebration and relief at Pittodrie as Aberdeen got their first win, and their first goals, of the Premiership season.

Despite the team's poor start to the campaign, there was a sense of optimism among the support, fuelled by an encouraging midweek showing Shakhtar.

Prior to Karlsson's opener, you could feel a nervousness - and a bit of deja vu -  around the old ground as the Dons created, and spurned, several good opportunities.

However, when the penalty was dispatched a weight lifted off the players' shoulders and it felt like the roof was going to lift off the Red Shed as the supporters erupted with joy.

In recent weeks Aberdeen have had to face boos at the final whistle - not this time as the players and supporters celebrated a terrific win and performance.

Both will be hoping the standard has now been set.

According to new developments, After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Robin Roefs (Sunderland): I did not think he made loads of great saves but he made some big ones. A massive performance for Sunderland away at Chelsea. These are the games where you need your key players to step up. I thought he was pivotal for them in crucial moments.

Matty Cash (Aston Villa): I could have put him in last week. He was excellent again, a wonderful finish for the winner. I thought he was solid defensively which is not what he's known for. He faced Savinho, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku but went out there and I thought he was really good. That finish gets you in.

Joe Rodon (Leeds): He was a mountain. A great header for his goal but it was more about the pressure they were under in a huge game against West Ham at Elland Road on a Friday. You have to go into those games and just dominate. He adapted himself, he's started to find his feet and show he is capable of playing to a really good level.

Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa): In my opinion he was man of the match, I thought he was excellent. Solid, some really smart plays. In the first half, he puts his leg back when Erling Haaland would be through on goal. In the second half, if he doesn't make the contact, Haaland is again through. Excellent defending, excellent in being a general. I thought he was fantastic.

Micky van de Ven (Tottenham): Any centre-half who keeps a clean sheet and gets two goals has to go in the team for me. I wanted to put Gabriel in but I just thought Van de Ven's performance was very good in a game where I thought Spurs could struggle. They've been poor the last couple of weeks and it's a huge win for them as well.

Quilindschy Hartman (Burnley): Two assists on the day in a huge game for Burnley who came away with a monstrous win at Wolves. In my opinion that all but relegates Wolves now. Two assists was fantastic in a week that has been dominated by dodgy decisions and unbelievable results. I think Burnley have got the result of the weekend. Most people won't see it as that because they're too busy looking at the top, but it's a massive result.

Brenden Aaronson (Leeds): I think that was a huge call to put him in. There has been a bit of a call for him to be dropped. He gets the opening goal, missed a few chances in weeks before, but it was a monstrous performance. He stepped up into the game and took the initiative to say "I'm going to be the difference maker today". He showed why he should be in that Leeds team.

Granit Xhaka (Sunderland): Loads of people will look at all of the new signings, look at the young players that Sunderland have. Xhaka is the general on that pitch. He organises, tackles, has people doing his running for him. He reminds me of what John Terry used to be like at Chelsea towards the end of his career. He's just a level above everyone else. The way he wraps the passes in, he gets everything right. For me, he was sensational.

Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United): I wanted to put Matheus Cunha in but Mbeumo got that second goal. You can see he's found his feet now, he's comfortable, the shirt is not a problem, playing at Manchester United is not a problem. Him and Cunha are the reason they are going to be able to fly up the league. Both of them are talented, both of them are exceptional. The two goals Mbeumo scored were magnificent. When it got a little bit ropey towards the end, that chance fell to him and I don't think anyone thought he was going to miss. Huge from him, huge for Manchester United.

Wilson Isidor (Sunderland): He's really taken to the Premier League much more than I thought he would. I thought he would struggle if I'm being 100% honest. He didn't set the world alight in the Championship, he only got 13 goals, which is pretty poor considering the team ended up getting promoted. He's also a bit gangly, a bit crude, but he's done really well in the Premier League. Maybe stepping up has forced him to raise his game.

Zian Flemming (Burnley): Two goals in a must-win game. I thought he was excellent, led the line really well. His hold-up play was good but you've got to be able to score goals. It's really good for Burnley that they've got someone who's scoring goals now.

Keith Andrews (Brentford): Unbelievable win against Liverpool. Keith is defying all the odds, playing to his strengths and getting after these teams. I thought he was really good and his tactical decisions were great as well.

Zian Flemming

Molineux was the stage for a thrilling game at the weekend, with bottom side Wolves losing in dramatic circumstances to promoted Burnley.

The visitors looked home and dry when Zian Flemming scored twice in the first 30 minutes, with the Dutchman becoming the first Burnley player to score more than once in a Premier League away game since Maxwel Cornet against Southampton in October 2021.

Both of Flemming's goals came via Quilindschy Hartman assists, the first time one Burnley player had assisted another twice or more in a Premier League game since April 2021, when Dwight McNeil twice assisted Chris Wood - also at Wolves.

Wolves fought back and levelled but the Clarets took the points as Flemming produced an impressive overall display, racking up three shots on target, six touches in the opposition box and winning 14 duels.

Bryan Mbeumo

Manchester United's resurgence gained more momentum against Brighton on Saturday, with Ruben Amorim's improving side securing an impressive 4-2 win.

Summer signing Bryan Mbeumo has been one of the shining lights for the Red Devils this season and against the Seagulls he came up with the goods once more. 

His two goals took his tally of top-flight goal involvements against Brighton to eight (five goals, three assists), his joint-best return against any side.

On Saturday, Mbeumo returned team highs for both shots on target (three) and chances created (two, the joint-most). 

Overall this season, the former Brentford man leads the way for United in the league in terms of goals (four), shots (23) and goal involvements (five), while only Bruno Fernandes has created more chances (24 to Mbeumo's 16).

Indeed, since the start of last season, only Mohamed Salah (52) and Erling Haaland (37) have registered more Premier League goal involvements than the Cameroon forward (32).

Micky van de Ven

Thomas Frank has enjoyed an impressive start to his tenure in north London and oversaw yet another good away win at the weekend.

The star of the show against Everton was Micky van de Ven, with the Spurs captain becoming the first defender to score twice in a Premier League game for the club since Jan Vertonghen in March 2013, who also did so on Merseyside against Liverpool.

Overall, the Dutchman topped the game rankings for passes (71), accurate passes (63), touches (86) and interceptions (3) on the way to a well-earned clean sheet.

This season, Van de Ven tops his club's rankings for passes (542), accurate passes (500) and headed clearances (24) while his importance to Tottenham is also highlighted by their 50% win rate when he starts in the Premier League, compared to 32% when he doesn't.

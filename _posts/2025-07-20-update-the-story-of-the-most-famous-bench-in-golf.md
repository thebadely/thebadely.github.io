Experts revealed that Rory McIlroy is one of a number of players to make use of the famous bench on the sixth tee

For almost 15 years it has been dubbed the most famous bench in golf.

Sitting proudly on the sixth tee at Royal Portrush, with views of the beach below and coast for miles either side, it has gone viral at this year's Open.

Some of the sport's biggest names - including Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm - have been pictured resting up at the back end of the course.

The inscription reads: "Jim McDowell - from just a few of his many golfing friends to mark the occasion of his 70th birthday."

But what is the story behind it? It involves camaraderie and friendship, something at the heart of golf. 

"Dad's not with us any more but he used to play every Wednesday at Royal Portrush with a group of hackers," said Jim's daughter, Zoe. 

"They had the best time and they would have a wee regroup at the halfway house and play pretty well on the back nine.

"They eventually all became friends and it was a really eclectic mix of people that Dad brought together, so they decided on his 70th they would chip in and get him a bench."

Watch: Sisters Claire and Zoe share the story behind their dad's bench on the sixth hole of Royal Portrush.

Zoe said the secretary of Royal Portrush at the time picked the location on the iconic sixth tee and it was unveiled as a surprise to Jim for his big day.

"She knew the lie of the land and we think she picked the best spot,"  Zoe added.

"It was a surprise for him and it's been a joy to enjoy it ever since. 

"Dad was really excited because he was one of the few people to get a bench while they were still alive. He would often sit on it with his friends and have the craic. 

"There have been a lot of stories and family memories from the bench, and now it's been amazing to see so many people from this Open enjoying it."

Claire, Jim's other daughter, said her father "would have absolutely loved" seeing some of the sport's biggest names enjoy his bench at the Open.

The sisters added they come and visit the bench every year to reflect on memories of their dad. In Claire's words, "most people go to a grave - we go to a bench".

"We were so excited and we know Dad would have got such a kick from it," she said while enjoying the Open with Zoe on Saturday.

"He would have loved it if he was still here. 

"It's been a bit mad, but we always thought it was the best bench in golf. There was never any dispute around that for us, it's pretty cool." 

The bench is a legacy of friendship - in a way that only a sport like golf can provide - and now others can enjoy a moment of tranquillity, reflection or craic - including some of the sport's biggest names.

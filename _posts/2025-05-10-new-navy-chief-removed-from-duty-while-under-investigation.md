Let's dive into the details: The head of the Royal Navy Adm Sir Ben Key has been removed from his duties while under investigation over allegations of misconduct, the Ministry of Defence has said.

The MoD has not given any further details on the matter he is being investigated for, saying that it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.

This statement follows reports in the Sun that Adm Key was suspected of having an affair with a female subordinate.

Earlier this week, the MoD issued a statement to say that the First Sea Lord had "stepped back due to private reasons".

Adm Key was due to retire from his position this summer, after serving as the head of the Royal Navy since 2021. This means the search for his successor was under way before an investigation into his conduct was started.

Senior officers can be removed from command and their duties if there is a reasonable suspicion that they are having a sexual relationship with someone more junior in their chain of command. 

Such relationships are frowned upon and seen as a potential abuse of power and contrary to the military service code of conduct. 

The MoD has not said long the investigation will take, with details of the allegations likely to remain private, or commented on whether he is likely to return to duty given his imminent retirement.

A defence source said the MoD would only comment further "if appropriate".

Until a new First Sea Lord is elected, the Second Sea Lord, Vice Adm Sir Martin Connell, has taken full command of the Royal Navy.

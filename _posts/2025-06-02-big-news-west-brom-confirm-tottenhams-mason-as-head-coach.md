Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Ryan Mason won one England cap as a player 

West Brom have appointed Ryan Mason as their head coach. 

The Championship side, who dismissed Tony Mowbray on 21 April, opened talks with Mason, 33, last week and he arrives at the Hawthorns on a three-year deal. 

It brings a seven-year coaching career at Tottenham to an end for Mason, who progressed through the club's academy to also play 70 times for his boyhood team.

"This is a huge club with a fantastic infrastructure and an incredible fanbase, and I am excited about what we can achieve together," said Mason.

"Having spoken at length to the board and those at the club I am convinced that Albion is the perfect place for me to be and I can't wait to get started.

"I will bring with me a huge amount of enthusiasm, dedication and ambition, and look forward to a positive future together at such a fantastic club."

The former midfielder's contract at Spurs had been set to expire at the end of June. 

Mason will now attempt to guide West Brom back into the Premier League for the first time since 2020-21, with the club finishing just outside the play-off spots last term. 

Nigel Gibbs, who joins from Reading, has been named Mason's assistant, with Sam Pooley coming in from Rangers as the club's first-team coach and head of performance.

Mason joined Tottenham's coaching team in April 2018, playing a key role in the club's academy before becoming interim first-team manager following the sacking of Jose Mourinho in 2021.

He had been part of Tottenham's senior set-up ever since, becoming acting head coach for a second time following the departure of Antonio Conte in 2023.

Mason remained a senior coach during Ange Postecoglou's reign.

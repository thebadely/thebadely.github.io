Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England beat Germany in the 2022 final

England and Wales' Women's Euro 2025 campaigns start on Saturday.

Will Sarina Wiegman's side defend the title they won in 2022? Will Wales cause an upset as they make their debut in a major tournament?

These are just two questions avid fans will have as the top European teams compete in the finals in Switzerland.

BBC Sport provides the lowdown on all the key details for Women's Euro 2025.

Held in Switzerland, the tournament began on Wednesday, 2 July.

Rather than the custom of the host country beginning the tournament, the opening fixture saw Iceland lose to Finland.

Switzerland played later that day at St Jakob-Park - the 35,689-seater home of FC Basel - where they lost to Norway.

The tournament will conclude with the final at the same stadium on Sunday, 27 July.

This will be the first time Switzerland has organised a women's sporting event of this scale.

Group A: Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Finland.

Group B: Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy.

Group C: Germany, Poland, Denmark, Sweden.

Group D: France, England, Wales, Netherlands.

Opta's 'supercomputer' has calculated that Spain are the overwhelming favourites, with the world champions given a 25% chance of winning the tournament.

England are ranked second, defending their title in 17% of simulations, while debutants Wales have been given a 0% chance of going all the way.

England's group matches: 5 July v France in Zurich (20:00 BST), 9 July v Netherlands in Zurich (17:00 BST), 13 July v Wales in St Gallen (20:00 BST).

Wales' group matches: 5 July v Netherlands in Lucerne (17:00 BST), 9 July v France in St Gallen (20:00 BST), 13 July v England in St Gallen (20:00 BST).

England's squad for Switzerland contains 13 players that were part of their triumphant Euros pool on home soil in 2022.

The Lionesses are, however, without some big names.

Goalkeeper Mary Earps announced her retirement from international football just five weeks before the start of the tournament, with Fran Kirby following suit.

Key defender Millie Bright is also missing, having made herself unavailable by saying she is unable to "give 100% mentally or physically".

Chelsea forward Lauren James has been selected despite not playing since April - but teenager Michelle Agyemang is an exciting addition.

Sophie Ingle was the surprise inclusion in Rhian Wilkinson's squad. 

The 33-year-old midfielder did not play a single game for Chelsea last season after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in September, but the Wales manager said Ingle was "in a position to contribute".

Angharad James will captain the squad, which includes her Seattle Reign midfield team-mate Jess Fishlock - Wales' record cap-holder and goalscorer.

Veteran forward Kayleigh Barton, 37, was picked despite ending her playing career at Charlton Athletic earlier in June to take on a head coach role at Saltdean United.

However, ACL injuries have deprived Wilkinson of three players, with Mayzee Davies, Megan Wynne and Laura O'Sullivan all missing.

Meet the Wales players

The top two teams from each of the four groups go through to the quarter-finals.

If England or Wales win Group D, they will play the runner-up of Group C, which contains Germany, Poland, Denmark and Sweden.

The runner-up from Group D will play the winner of Group C.

Spain and Germany were the first teams, after hosts Switzerland, to qualify for the tournament - doing so in June 2024 after losing just one game each.

Germany, France, Sweden and debutants Poland will feel confident arriving in Switzerland, boasting an unbeaten record in 2025.

England, meanwhile, have struggled for the same consistency this year. The Lionesses hit six past Portugal earlier this month, but they were beaten by both Spain and Belgium.

Wales have yet to win a game in 2025, but Wilkinson's side have been difficult to beat and have claimed two impressive draws against higher-ranked Sweden.

Real Madrid's Caroline Weir and Chelsea's Erin Cuthbert will play no part in the competition because Scotland failed to qualify.

Scotland, who played in the 2017 edition, lost to Finland in the second round of the play-offs to miss this year's championship.

Arsenal left-back Katie McCabe also misses out because the Republic of Ireland, who are yet to appear at a Women's European Championship, were beaten by Wales in the play-offs.

Germany's Lena Oberdorf, who was named young player of the tournament at Euro 2022, misses out because of an anterior cruciate ligament knee injury.

Hosts Switzerland, meanwhile, will be without star striker Ramona Bachmann after the 34-year-old suffered the same injury in training earlier this month.

It has been recently reported that Former Buffalo Bills assistant coach Phoebe Schecter is an NFL pundit and plays for Great Britain's flag football team

The Kansas City Chiefs are out of contention for this season's NFL play-offs and so too are their conference rivals Cincinnati.

I just don't see the Baltimore Ravens getting in either. They need to win their last two games to have a chance, so in terms of quarterbacks, that would be a three-headed monster missing from the AFC - Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes.

All three having injuries this season is just wild, and Jackson went off with another in Sunday's loss to New England. He's already missed three games and in each of the past six weeks has missed at least one day of practice.

I don't think he's ever fully recovered from the main hamstring injured he had. There was one game where it was like "hey, he's back. He's moving like the Lamar Jackson that we're used to".

But if you look at his other injuries -  toe, ankle, knee, and now his back - I feel like he's a bit more fragile at the moment, after all the hits he's taken. He's had injuries adding up over the years, so is his style of play sustainable?

I really hope his Super Bowl window hasn't closed because he's so wonderful to watch.

I just think there needs to be a bit of a shake-up at Baltimore because there were some odd moments in Sunday's game, with the play calling and top players making big mistakes in big moments. At the end of the season, someone's got to take responsibility.

The two main things they've struggled with is Lamar not being healthy and having zero pass rush. I just don't understand it - defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike went down early in the season, so why you wouldn't find an impact player from a pass-rush perspective?

The Ravens used to have this attitude. Teams used to be scared of that pass rush, that defensive line, and they've kind of lost that.

It's the same with the Bengals and Chiefs. Although you keep winning, and that means you don't have high draft picks, you've got to be able to build depth in those moments.

If you're investing on one side of the ball, you've got to draft on the other side. You've got to find ways to strengthen an already elite team - the team that's done it best is the Philadelphia Eagles and their general manager Howie Roseman.

NFL 2025 season: Week 17

25-29 December 2025

I worry more about Joe Burrow's window closing because since reaching that LA Super Bowl in 2022, Cincinnati have not looked the same.

I don't know if I trust their organisation to draft and bring in the depth they need. In Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, the Bengals have the NFL's most expensive offence, from a salary cap perspective. 

It's always been able to hum a little, but the offensive line still needs strengthening and the defensive line, in particular, has been anaemic.

They had this weird pre-season, not wanting to give Trey Hendrickson the contract he wanted, and they've drafted some good young players, but why did they not do this years ago?

When the Bengals had a back-up QB in there, it showed how much Burrow does for the team and how he really extends plays. He is a freak of nature.

He's the kind of guy that you want in the play-offs, in the Super Bowl, because he gets more dangerous as the season goes on. But it's sad to think all three of these quarterbacks won't be there this time.

Other teams are stepping up, because you're drafting to kind of beat the guys in your division. In the AFC North, the Pittsburgh Steelers have always been consistent, but 100% it should have been the Ravens or Bengals winning that division this season.

The Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers have been building out their rosters to beat the Chiefs in the AFC West. What happens now the tables have been flipped? What will next season look like now the Chiefs will have higher draft capital?

You hope that they're able to bring in or develop some star receivers. I know they wanted Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy to be that. But really, since Tyreek Hill left in 2022, they've not had that number one, true threat receiver.

I like that in their last two games they'll be able to get some of their young guys true NFL game experience. That's going to be crucial and will probably give them an upper hand long term.

They've been working in some of the younger tight ends, but if Travis Kelce retires, what does that look like? Who becomes that reliable player that Mahomes feels comfortable throwing to because, especially coming back from injury, he's going to need somebody he can trust.

This is a really big recovery for him. I would be amazed if he's able to recover to the point where he can start next season and be mobile. But he's always going to have an opportunity because of who he is as a quarterback and a competitor.

The Chiefs have a lot of pending free agents so how they manage that - who they're bringing back, who they're bringing in - will be a really big piece of the puzzle for them.

My concern for them getting back to the play-offs next season is that the AFC West is really competitive. Are the Chiefs going to beat the Broncos twice a year? Are they going to beat the Chargers twice a year?

I feel more confident in the Bengals and Ravens, and either of them winning the AFC North. The Ravens are probably the most whole team. They need a couple more pieces on defence.

The Bengals need an entire defence, but at least they've got an offence that can be high-powered. I feel like the Chiefs are going to have to start from ground zero.

But for now, the three-headed monster is gone from the AFC, so maybe the path is clear for my Buffalo Bills to finally get back to the Super Bowl.

Let's dive into the details: Jake Paul and Gervonta Davis fight are seperated by seven weight classes

The venue for Jake Paul and Gervonta Davis' fight has been moved to Florida after doubts were raised over whether it would gain permission to take place at the original venue in Georgia.

The bout on 14 November had been in jeopardy after Georgia officials said the fight would no longer be taking place under their governance.

But organisers MVP Promotions announced on Wednesday that the event will instead be held at the Kaseya Center in Miami.

"New city, same mission, seek and destroy the tank," Paul said in a statement. "Kaseya Center. Friday, November 14. I'm bringing the heat."

Earlier on Wednesday, the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission (GAEC) told USA Today, external that MVP Promotions had halted its efforts to get the fight sanctioned.

Rick Thompson, chairman of the GAEC, said MVP had withdrawn the event permits and rule waivers required to hold the fight in Georgia.

"I believe it's in the public's interest to know that because they've been promoting something they should not have been,'' Thompson said.

Responding to the mounting speculation, Nakisa Bidarian, who co-founded MVP with Paul, said on social media: "Fight is not in doubt. Never has been. Stay tuned."

Paul v Davis was set to be an exhibition fight but there has been no clarification about which rules will apply.

Davis is a lightweight world champion, fighting at 9st 9lb (61kg), while Paul has fought most of his career at cruiserweight, which is 14st 4lb (90.7kg).

The fight would not count on their professional records and a weight agreement would need to be reached.

The GAEC was scheduled to vote on the issue on Thursday.

"They probably evaluated a situation - knew that their weight differences were too much,'' said Thompson.

BBC Sport has asked MVP for comment.

All exhibition and professional bouts in the US are overseen by a state's individual athletic commission.

Paul and Davis hold professional boxing licences but, while Davis has been fighting at world title level, Paul has fought mostly ex-MMA fighters.

The YouTuber turned boxer secured the biggest win of his career in his last bout when he beat Julio Cesar Chavez Jr on points.

A news conference is scheduled to take place on Monday in New York before one in Miami the following day.

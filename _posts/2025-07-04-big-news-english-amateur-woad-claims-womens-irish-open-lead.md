Full leaderboard

English amateur Lottie Woad carded a second-round 67 to take a three-shot lead at the halfway point of the Women's Irish Open at Carton House. 

Woad, 21, recorded seven birdies and just one bogey in windy conditions to lead Switzerland's overnight joint-leader Chiara Tamburlini, who birdied her last hole for a two-under 71. 

World number 19 Charley Hull of England shot a bogey-free 69 and shares third place alongside Australia's Kirsten Rudgeley (68), Sweden's four-time Solheim Cup player Madelene Sagstrom (71) and New Zealand's Amelia Garvey (70). 

England's Hannah Screen (72) and Alexandra Swayne of the Virgin Islands (72) are a shot further back on six-under.

Anna Foster (74) leads the Irish challenge on one-under, but Leona Maguire is 12 shots adrift after carding three bogeys and a double in a 75. 

Woad is the world's top-ranked amateur and served notice of her potential with victory in the Augusta National Women's Amateur and a top-10 finish in the Women's Open last year.

And while she has not yet turned professional, the Florida State University player has put herself in a strong position to win her first Ladies European Tour title with 36 holes to go in County Kildare.

After a bogey-free opening 68, Woad started Friday's round on the 10th and picked up three shots on her front nine. 

Woad, from Farnham in Surrey, gained another three strokes in the first six holes of her second nine, and while a solitary blemish came on the par-four eighth, a closing birdie extended her advantage at the top of the leaderboard.

Woad led by four until 2024 Order of Merit winner Tamburlini knocked her approach at the final hole to within a foot for a closing birdie.

But while Woad shone, home favourite Maguire failed to build on her opening 72 as she dropped three shots in her first five holes. 

The three-time Solheim Cup player then mixed three birdies with a double bogey on the back nine to sit in a tie for 49th alongside England's former Open champion Georgia Hall, who shot 76.

Irish amateur Emma Fleming followed an impressive first-round 69 with a 77 to slip back to even par.

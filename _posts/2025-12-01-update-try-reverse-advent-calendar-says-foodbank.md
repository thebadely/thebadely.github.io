Here’s what you need to know: A foodbank is asking donors to consider trying a "reverse advent calendar" this year – giving 24 items to help provide Christmas hampers to families in need.

Salisbury Foodbank in Wiltshire, part of the Trussell Trust network, said it was in need of donations to make up packages for 200 local families. 

Manager Maria Stevenson said the reverse advent calendar idea in previous years has helped drive the donations for the Christmas hampers, which are sent out on 21 December.

She said festive items were required this year, such as Christmas cake, cranberry sauce, gravy, and chocolate coins for stockings, as well as essentials such as toilet roll, toothbrushes and deodorant.

The foodbank often has reverse advent calendar donations from schools, community groups and businesses as well as individuals.

"Christmas is the most giving time of the year," Ms Stevenson told BBC Radio Wiltshire.

"It's a time when people reflect - they're sitting at home, they're thinking about what they're going to buy for their family, [to] bring some joy to their family and bring joy to people less privileged than themselves as well."

She said that some Christmas donations have come in already but that more are needed, by 15 December.

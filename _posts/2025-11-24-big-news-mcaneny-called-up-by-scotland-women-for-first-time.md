Experts revealed that Maria McAneny scored in Celtic's weekend win over Partick Thistle

Celtic midfielder Maria McAneny has been called up by Scotland women for the first time for friendly matches against Ukraine and China.

The 21-year-old has been capped by Scotland Under-23s.

Melissa Andreatta's side face Ukraine in Jerez, Spain, on Friday (11:00 GMT) then meet China, also at Estadio Municipal de Chapin, on 2 December (18:00).

The Scots last month lost at home to Switzerland after an away win over Morocco, with both fixtures friendlies.

And, in 2026, Scotland will face Belgium, Israel and Luxembourg in World Cup qualifying.

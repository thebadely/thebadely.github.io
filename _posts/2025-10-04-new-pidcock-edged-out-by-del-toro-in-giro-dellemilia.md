According to new developments, Isaac del Toro finished second in this year's Giro d'Italia

Britain's Tom Pidcock finished second in the 108th Giro dell'Emilia after he was beaten in a thrilling sprint finish by Isaac del Toro.

With 1.5km of the 199.2 km road race in the Italian city of Bologna remaining Pidcock had opened up a lead of around 10 seconds.

However, the 26-year-old was unable to maintain the pace which allowed Mexican Del Toro to catch him with 700m left.

UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider Del Toro went early with his sprint for the line but Pidcock was unable to respond as he missed the chance to become the first British winner in the race's history.

Del Toro won in a time of four hours 46 minutes and 10 seconds with Pidcock second and Frenchman Lenny Martinez a further five seconds behind in third.

"Getting second place again is bittersweet," said Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team rider Pidcock, who finished third in the recent Vuelta a Espana, 

"But it's always positive to be on the podium and a good way to start the final week of the season."

Pidcock's fellow Briton Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) finished ninth while compatriot Ben Tulett (Visma-Lease a Bike) came sixth.

The Israel-Premier Tech team was excluded from taking part in the race for safety reasons following disruption at the Vuelta where it was targeted by pro-Palestinian protests opposing Israel's war in Gaza.

The 12th edition of the women's Giro dell'Emilia was won by Kimberley le Court of Mauritius with New Zealander Niamh Fisher-Black in second and Dutchwoman Yara Kastelijn third.

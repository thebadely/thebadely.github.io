It has been recently reported that Family members of an Oasis fan who died when he fell from a height at the band's concert at Wembley Stadium on Saturday have paid tribute to him as "a loving family man".

Lee Claydon, 45, from Bournemouth, was "a lovely bloke" and a "hard working family man", his father Clive said. 

The 75-year old said his family were devastated and that his son had "everything going for him".

On Sunday, police said a man in his 40s "was found with injuries consistent with a fall" and was pronounced dead at the scene at the stadium in London

Mr Claydon, a landscape gardener, reportedly fell from an upper tier of the stadium. 

His father said the father-of-three "may have had a couple of beers but had not taken any drugs".

"People have said horrible things but it was just an accident." 

He said he was concerned about safety measures at the stadium but that none of his family had seen the incident. 

"All I know is there was beer everywhere, it's slippery, he slipped apparently, we do not know the rest of it. There's questions about the barriers."

Lee's brother Aaron wrote on Facebook: "Still in shock and cannot believe I am writing this, but sadly over the weekend I lost my best mate the man I looked up to and the man I was lucky enough to call my brother Lee Claydon."

More than Â£10,000 has been donated to a GoFundMe page he set up for his brother's partner and sons. 

On Facebook, another family member, Shannon Gabrielle, wrote: "My cousin Lee tragically passed away this weekend after no doubt having the time of his life at the Oasis concert this weekend.

"Most will have seen snippets in the news I'm sure & as you can imagine it has devastated the whole family and for his closest knit family unit it's the toughest time they are going through ever right now."

She added: "You just don't fathom you will go out for a night of amazing fun & not come home at the end of it."

On Sunday, Oasis said in a statement they were "shocked and saddened" to hear of the death of a fan.

They added: "Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved."

The Metropolitan Police has asked for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who had mobile video footage, to share it with them it. 

"The stadium was busy, and we believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage." 

The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.

A spokesperson for Wembley Stadium said: "Wembley Stadium operates to a very high health and safety standard, fully meeting legal requirements for the safety of spectators and staff." 

"Despite their efforts, the fan very sadly died. Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers," the venue said.

The band began the Oasis Live '25 reunion tour in July. Saturday's concert was one of seven sold-out reunion concerts at Wembley, which has a 90,000-person capacity across three tiers.

The band will next appear at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium for three gigs over the next week and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September.

Let's dive into the details: Flu hit early this winter with a new mutated version of the virus circulating. 

The NHS sent out a "flu jab SOS" encouraging vulnerable people to get their free vaccination. 

But is it still worth paying for a jab even if you are generally fit and healthy?

The version circulating this winter is H3N2 "subclade K", a type of seasonal influenza A virus. Some are calling it "super flu".

That is not a medical term, and it does not mean the virus itself has become harder to treat.

But people have not encountered much of it in recent years, which means there is less built up immunity against it in the community. 

Flu jabs still work to protect against severe illness. 

In early December, the number of flu patients in hospital hit a record high in England for this time of year. There were an average of 2,660 patients a day in hospital with flu - a rise of 55% on the previous week.

That rise subsequently slowed and then decreased.

Christmas gatherings, however, may have caused a bit of a resurgence, with hospital cases rising again.

It's difficult to predict how long this wave of flu will last. 

The NHS national medical director Professor Meghana Pandit has warned that "the worst is far from over for the NHS".

Dr Jamie Lopez-Bernal from the UK Health Security Agency (UHSA) said that "everyone, especially those most vulnerable to these winter bugs, needs to take care to protect themselves or help not to spread these viruses to others".

The NHS offers a free flu vaccine to those who need it most, including: 

Eligible people can go online to book.

Frontline health and social care workers can get the vaccine through their employer. 

A nasal spray version is also offered to children aged 2 to 3 years as well as school-aged children (reception to year 11). 

Children can catch and spread flu easily. Vaccinating them also helps protect others who are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from flu.

Prof Pandit urged those who are entitled to a free vaccine to come forward, arguing that "it's not too late" to benefit from the protection it provides. 

This year's flu has hit many people who are generally healthy, so you might want to buy a flu vaccine even if you don't have any underlying medical conditions. 

High street chemists sell the jab for around £10-20.

Almost everybody can have it, but you should not have it if you have ever had a serious allergy to the vaccine, or any of its ingredients. 

Speak to the pharmacist if you are unsure. 

The government says there is no national shortage of the vaccine for those who need it the most - people who can get it for free from the NHS. 

At the end of December, the NHS said 18 million flu vaccines had been delivered - 306,000 more than at the same point in 2024.

However, in the run up to Christmas there were a number of reports of pharmacies turning private patients away because of a shortage of doses, so you may need to shop around.  

The vaccine works against the flu that is circulating this year, and usually takes up to 14 days to take effect.

During this period, you're still vulnerable to catching the virus. 

Some people mistakenly think the vaccine has given them flu, but the vaccine does not cause flu - instead, it gives your body the instructions it needs to fight off an infection should you catch it.  

There's still a chance you might get flu after getting vaccinated, but it's likely to be milder and not last as long.

Protection decreases over time which is why a vaccine is offered every year. 

The vaccine is frequently updated to best match the strain or version of flu that experts expect will be circulating. 

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was "not changing its guidance" on face masks.

The advice supports personal choice but says people with flu-like symptoms should "consider" wearing one to help stop the virus spreading. 

Some hospitals are asking visitors to wear them. 

There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds. So how do you know if you have flu rather than something else? Your symptoms can give a clue. 

Colds

Flu

Covid

Most people get better with one or two weeks' bed rest, but for some flu can develop into pneumonia.

The first port of call if you think you should seek medical help is to call 111 or go to your GP. 

However, if you're struggling to breathe or getting chest pain, then call 999 or go to hospital.

If you're meeting people indoors, open a window for fresh air.

Practise good hygiene:

If you are unwell but must go out, consider wearing a face mask.

After pulling off a remarkable victory against Lyon in the Women's Champions League semi-finals last month, Arsenal are 90 minutes away from European glory.

Barcelona stand between Renee Slegers' side and a second European crown, 18 years since the Gunners last appeared in the final.

In April 2007, Arsenal became the first - and so far only - English side to win the competition, then called the Uefa Women's Cup.

Vic Akers' quadruple-winning team overcame Sweden's Umea 1-0 on aggregate in a two-legged final, with Alex Scott's long-range stunner in first leg injury-time proving the difference.

That Arsenal team was packed with legendary players who went on to achieve remarkable feats both on and off the pitch.

Lining up against the Gunners was a 21-year-old Brazilian forward named Marta - we all know where she ended up, but what happened to Arsenal's history-makers?

The Arsenal starting XI for both legs of the 2007 Uefa Women's Cup final

Goalkeeper Emma Byrne played a key role in Arsenal's dominance of the 2000s and early 2010s, winning 11 top-flight league titles, nine Women's FA Cups and three League Cups.

Over 16 years she made 459 appearances for Arsenal, the most in the club's history.

The former Republic of Ireland international was capped a record 134 times for her country, and in 2018 became the first female player to be inducted into the Irish Football Association's Hall of Fame.

Byrne left Arsenal in December 2016 at the end of her contract, and after playing for second tier Brighton in the 2017 Spring Series, announced her retirement at the age of 38.

In 2019, she came out of retirement to join Terrassa FC in Spain, but an Achilles injury forced her to retire again.

Byrne has since coached in Arsenal's academy, worked as a goalkeeper coach with Ireland and provided punditry and commentary.

Alex Scott turned to broadcasting after retiring from playing

Alex Scott had three separate spells at Arsenal after graduating from the club's academy, making 313 appearances and winning 18 major trophies.

The right-back represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games and earned 140 caps for England, a total bettered only by former Gunners team-mate Karen Carney, Jill Scott and Fara Williams.

Since retiring in 2018, Scott has become one of the faces of BBC Sport, covering both women's and men's football.

She's also branched out into non-sports broadcasting as an occasional host of The One Show.

Anita Asante's 20-year career began at Arsenal after progressing through the club's youth ranks, where she made 160 appearances.

After retiring in 2022, the former defender became a first-team coach at Bristol City, who she helped win promotion to the WSL, and has coached the England Under-23 team.

Asante regularly appears as a pundit on BBC Sport's coverage of the WSL and the Women's FA Cup.

Katie Chapman played a key role in Arsenal's success both in central midfield and defence, following spells with Millwall, Charlton and Fulham.

She spent seven years with the Gunners - with a short spell with Chicago Red Stars sandwiched in the middle - before leaving in 2013 to play for London rivals Chelsea.

Chapman - who earned 94 England caps - is now an ambassador for Chelsea.

Versatile defender Mary Phillip only spent four seasons at Arsenal between 2004 and 2008, but in each one she helped the Gunners to league and FA Cup doubles.

Phillip earned 65 caps for England and became the first black captain of the Lionesses.

After retiring in 2008 aged 31, following a brief stint with Chelsea, Phillip turned to coaching.

In 2019, she became manager of men's non-league side Peckham Town - a position she still holds today - two years after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).

A year later they became the first senior men's team to win a trophy with a female manager.

Karen Carney won the FA Cup, the league title, the League Cup and the Uefa Women's Cup in 2006-07 with Arsenal

Karen Carney is perhaps better known for her time at Chelsea and Birmingham City, but she was a key part of the quadruple-winning side of 2007.

The midfielder made appearances for England and represented Great Britain at the 2012 London Olympics.

Since retiring in 2019, Carney has been a prominent pundit on both men's and women's football for various broadcasters, covering international tournaments, Champions League and domestic competitions.

In 2022, she was appointed chair of the Future of Women's Football Review for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, looking into ways the government can develop women's football.

Jayne Ludlow played 356 games over 13 years at Arsenal, putting her third on the club's all-time appearance list.

The midfielder scored 221 goals - the most in club history - and captained the side in both legs of the European final. She also won nine league titles and six FA Cups.

The former Wales international moved straight into coaching upon retiring in 2013, holding youth coaching roles with Arsenal and Wales.

Ludlow took charge of the Wales women's team in 2014 after a season managing Reading, before spending three years as technical director of Manchester City Girls' Academy until early last year.

With 403 appearances to her name, only Emma Byrne has played more games for Arsenal than Ciara Grant.

The midfielder - who earned 105 caps for the Republic of Ireland - brought her 16-year association with Arsenal to an end by joining Reading in 2014, before retiring a year later.

Grant - who won nine league titles with the Gunners while working full-time as a development officer for the club - has had two children since retiring.

Arsenal won an unprecedented quadruple in 2007

Rachel Yankey enjoyed two spells with Arsenal amounting to 15 years, during which time she won eight top-flight league titles and nine FA Women's Cups.

She won another two FA Cups and the league title during a four-year stint with Fulham, before returning to Arsenal in 2005 where she stayed until her retirement in 2016.

The midfielder's 314 appearances are the fourth most in club history, while 129 England caps puts her seventh on the all-time list.

Awarded both an OBE and MBE, Yankey is considered one of the most influential figures in women's football history.

Since retiring Yankey has coached at London Bees and Barnet, as well as providing sessions for school-age girls.

Yankey also regularly works in broadcasting, and is an occasional guest on the BBC's Women's Football Show.

Julie Fleeting scored in the Women's FA Cup final against Bristol Academy in 2011

Julie Fleeting is considered one of the pioneers of women's football, largely because she helped forge a pathway for British players to play in the United States.

In 2002, the striker joined San Diego Spirit, becoming the first Scot to play as a full-time professional in the Women's United Soccer Association.

She joined Arsenal in 2004, where she made 141 appearances and won eight league titles in eight years.

Fleeting remains Scotland's most prolific goalscorer, with 116 in 121 games.

For much of her time at Arsenal, the Scotland international continued to work as a PE teacher, flying down to London for matches.

Since retiring in 2016, Fleeting has continued to work as a PE teacher alongside broadcast work with BBC Scotland.

Forward Lianne Sanderson joined Arsenal at nine years old, before making her first-team debut at 15.

She made 184 appearances over two spells with the Gunners, and earned 50 caps for England.

After playing in Spain, Cyprus, the United States and Italy, Sanderson retired in 2019. The 37-year-old regularly covers women's football as a television pundit.

Here’s what you need to know: Former New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter, Rachel Priest, became the first head coach of Glamorgan Women ahead of their establishment in 2025

Head coach Rachel Priest and captain Lauren Parfitt say Glamorgan Women must use their progress in 2025 as a springboard towards becoming a fully professional side in 2027.

Glamorgan were beaten heavily by Yorkshire in Sunday's One Day Cup League 2 final in Worcester, but can reflect on a largely positive campaign which also included a T20 Blast semi-final.

Parfitt, 31, who balances cricket with her job as a teacher, said the squad had exceeded expectations and now had clear motivation for the seasons ahead.

"Initially, we didn't necessarily know what the season would bring," all-rounder Parfitt told BBC Sport Wales.â¨

"We're really proud to have achieved what we have this season and we'll look to improve on that next season and then into tier one for 2027.â¨

"I've absolutely loved it, every second of it."

The ECB's roadmap will see Glamorgan offer contracts from June 2026 before full professionalism begins a year later. 

Priest says that makes next season's campaigns critical for recruitment and development.

"We didn't know what to expect at the beginning of this competition â from our team, from all the other teams," said head coach Priest.

"So hopefully that's seen as success, and I'm just so proud of how the girls have gone about this season and the challenges put in front of them.

"I suppose this final has reflected where the two sides are â Yorkshire have kept a lot of their professional structures from the previous year.

"We knew coming into this game it was going to be tough. They're professional cricketers, so that's always going to be difficult when your team isn't yet."

Both coach and captain acknowledge that players will face big decisions as cricket careers come into sharper focus.

"It's not just us who have hard decisions to make, it's the girls as well," Priest explained.â¨

"You only get to be a professional cricketer for so long, so hopefully some of the girls will take that plunge."

For Parfitt, the prospect of realising a childhood dream is tantalising.

"What a fantastic place for women's cricket to be in," she said.â¨

"The 11-year-old me dreamt of being a professional cricketer and I would absolutely love to be one, so we'll see where it takes us."

Glamorgan relied on loan players from tier one teams this season and Priest is keen to repeat the strategy in 2026, while also targeting permanent recruits in time for professionalism. 

"We'll obviously be looking to do that again next season, and hopefully other teams do too," Priest said.â¨

"There's no point tier two cricketers sitting on the sidelines if they can be contributing and making our competition better. Probably even more importantly, we'll be looking to see who we can recruit permanently for the season after."

After a long campaign juggling cricket with work commitments, Glamorgan's players will now take a break before regrouping in November.

Priest, who hopes to remain in charge, says the foundations built in 2025 will prove vital over the next two years.

"The girls need a good break now â they've worked and trained so hard," she added.â¨

"I've loved every minute of it and I don't want to miss out on seeing more improvement as we move towards professionalism."

Experts revealed that Christian Burgess and Ross Sykes have won every major domestic honour in Belgium with Union Saint-Gilloise

As a history graduate who studied World War One, Union Saint-Gilloise captain Christian Burgess knows more than most about the importance of Belgian resilience in the face of a richer opponent with greater resources.

"I specialised in one of the small reasons the war happened - Belgium were basically protected by the UK and, when they were invaded, it was another reason for the UK to go to war," he told BBC Sport.

For a history buff, the region is fascinating - Burgess says just travelling around there are "monuments that you constantly drive past which remind you of the First and Second World Wars".

And, in keeping with the region's tenacity, his own career has also been a study in upsetting the odds - he admits to never truly expecting to be playing in the Champions League. When he faced PSV on 16 September he was, at the age of 33 years and 344 days, the oldest English outfield player to make his Champions League debut since Steve Bould for Arsenal in November 1998.

However, both Union Saint-Gilloise and their captain will be ready for their home debut in the competition even if they go in as underdogs when they host  Premier League heavyweights Newcastle United on 1 October.

"When I was a kid, I just remember watching the Champions League. I remember the final in Istanbul, watching Liverpool. I remember Chelsea-Barcelona with Ronaldinho's special goal. They're the sort of memories that stay with you and there is no way I ever thought I would be playing in that competition and for it to happen this late is very surreal," he said.

"I thought back to my childhood and thought I can't believe that I could possibly be leading a club out to play in that competition against these teams I used to be in awe of. You have to laugh otherwise you won't quite believe it."

Burgess made just one league appearance for Middlesbrough - against Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship in May 2013

Released by Arsenal as a youth player, Burgess went to university before he was offered a trial at Championship side Middlesbrough during his second year of study.

He earned a two-year professional contract, but was encouraged by then-manager Tony Mowbray to continue his education.

"It was something you couldn't turn down," he said of his first professional deal. "So I took it and finished my degree at Teesside University. They allowed me to transfer my first two years.

"Mowbray told me to make sure I finished it because the contract was a foot in the door, not a guaranteed career. I listened to his words and thankfully, I've been able to carve a career out with the game as well."

Burgess enjoyed spells in League One with Peterborough and Portsmouth, before taking the plunge with a move to Belgium in 2020.

And, remarkably, he is not the only English centre-back who has swapped life in the third tier for a crack at the Belgian top flight.

Defensive partner Ross Sykes was picked up from Accrington Stanley in 2022 after Union "took a chance" on him.

The pair went on to help Union win their first league title in 90 years last season after Sykes, like Burgess, overcame adversity in his formative years.

Sykes may be 6ft 5in now, but he was previously released by Burnley because he was deemed to "too small" as a kid.

It ended up proving a turning point in his career.

"I didn't want to keep going with academy football," he said after he was let go at the age of 11. "But my mum and dad persuaded me to go on trial at Accrington Stanley one or two weeks later. I didn't look back after that."

Sykes and Burgess have gone on to make 318 appearances between them for Union on a journey that has taken the Belgian league leaders to Europe's top table for the first time.

And Union's 3-1 win against PSV in their first Champions League fixture did not come as a surprise to Sykes last month because his side are "not afraid to come up against anyone".

Burgess certainly looked at home at Europe's top table. The Union captain was rated 9.39 out of 10 by BBC Sport readers, finishing the match as the top-ranking player.

An Englishman who has only played one league game in the top two tiers of English football might not seem the most obvious to lead a European campaign - but Union have always taken the road less travelled.

"It's a club built on the profile of bringing youngsters through from unknown leagues," Burgess explains. "We have players from the Estonian, Latvian, Croatian, Austrian leagues and Union will give them a chance to shine if they see potential.

"My role is to help them and keep demanding high standards and usher them through, and then they get big moves all over Europe, which is a pleasure to see."

Ross Sykes previously made 101 league appearances for Accrington Stanley

This tight-knit group of players were watching on in the canteen as Union discovered their opponents in the Champions League draw last month.

Union had already secured glamour ties against Bayern Munich, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid, but there was a particularly loud roar after the Belgian champions were paired with Newcastle.

Those present all immediately turned to Sykes, who leaped from his seat at the back of the room and punched the air. They knew how much it meant to the Englishman.

"Playing against your boyhood club in the Champions League? It doesn't get any better than that," he said.

Though Sykes is originally from Burnley, the centre-back grew up supporting Newcastle and idolised Alan Shearer and, latterly, Steven Taylor and Fabricio Coloccini, who played in his position.

Sykes even watched Newcastle's Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund from the stands at the Westfalenstadion a couple of years ago.

Now the centre-back could potentially line up against the Black and Whites in Brussels on Wednesday night.

"It would be a dream come true because it's not just any game - it's in the Champions League," he said. "It's the best competition you can play in at club level."

Defensive partner Burgess says Union are targeting a top-24 finish in the league phase, which would earn them a spot in the play-off round and a shot at a European giant in knock-out football.

Against a club like Union, and determined players like Burgess and Sykes, there should be no under-estimation.

"I've learned perseverance. Positivity as well, I've faced lots of downs throughout my career," Burgess says.

"At Portsmouth and Peterborough, I definitely took steps backwards before I was able to reach where I am today, and part of that is just to keep working hard."

Sykes will also have family watching on at Lotto Park on Wednesday night to see him potentially make his debut in the competition.

It would be the latest chapter in the 26-year-old's remarkable journey.

"Never give up," he said. "If you want something, you will always get rewarded for what you put in."

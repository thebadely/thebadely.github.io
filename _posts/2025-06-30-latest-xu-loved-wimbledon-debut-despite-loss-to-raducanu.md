Let's dive into the details: Mimi Xu has previously played at Junior Wimbledon 

Teenager Mimi Xu "loved every single moment" of her senior Wimbledon debut despite a straight sets first round defeat to Emma Raducanu.

Raducanu cruised to a comfortable 6-3 6-3 win against 17-year-old Xu, who had earned a wildcard for the Championships.

Xu, the first Welsh player to enter the Wimbledon main singles draw in 20 years, hopes the experience will inspire her to return to SW19.

"I loved every single moment out there," Xu told BBC Sport Wales.

"I wouldn't say it was my dream debut because winning would obviously have been my dream debut.

"But I'm really honoured and happy that this was my debut.

"I got to play a Grand Slam champion, a fellow Brit on a big court  â I don't think I could have asked for anything different.

"The crowd, the atmosphere, the courtâ¦ everything. I didn't want it to stop.

"When I came off court I started crying, but I wasn't upset I just felt 'oh my god I've just done that.'"

Swansea-born Xu had secured notable wins at the Birmingham, Ilkley and Nottingham Open events earlier this month.

She showed glimpses of her potential against the 2021 US Open champion, adding: "I've come so far even from last year.

"There's obviously a difference in my game to Emma but I honestly think I can get there and I really believe in myself.

"I was saying to people this is the best grass season I've ever had, even before Wimbledon.

"The past three years I've played on the women's side I've only won one match and in my first tournament I went past that so everything else was a bonus.

"I honestly think I've come a long way and I hope to keep continuing on that trajectory.

"I think my game's there â my good stuff is really good. It's just fine tuning and cleaning a few bits here and there," she added.

"But I honestly think I'm so ready, it's ignited the fire within me that I can do this."

Xu's focus now turns to the women's doubles at Wimbledon, where she will compete with fellow Briton Ella McDonald.

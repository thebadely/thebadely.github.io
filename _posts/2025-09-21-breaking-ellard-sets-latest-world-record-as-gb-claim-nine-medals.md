Experts revealed that William Ellard (centre) won two golds and one silver at Paris 2024

Paralympic champion William Ellard broke his own world record to win the men's 200m freestyle on the opening day of the World Para-swimming Championships in Singapore.

The 19-year-old, who set the mark during his first Paralympics at Paris 2024 with a time of one minute 51.30 seconds, bettered his pace in Singapore, winning the race with a time of 1:51.08.

Ellard said he was happy with the feat but still wanted to be quicker.

"I feel really good but I was expecting to go a bit faster, maybe 1:50.00 or 1:49.00," he explained. "I think I went out too quick and it got to me in my head. I was thinking about the time rather than the swim itself.

"But, it was a good race. I'm happy to get the gold."

Elsewhere, there were eight other medals for Great Britain on day one including two golds. 

Poppy Maskill won her first individual world title in the women's 200m freestyle S14, with Louise Fiddes also finishing on the podium in third place.

There was a British one-two in the Women's 400m freestyle S8 with Alice Tai edging out Brock Whiston.

Ellie Challis won the 12th world championship medal of her career with a second-placed finish in the women's 50m breaststroke SB2, while 14-year-old Iona Winnifrith claimed bronze in the women's 200m individual medley SM7.

And there was another double podium for Great Britain to round off day one, this time in the women's 100m backstroke S12.

Ela Letton-Jones and Astrid Carroll claimed silver and bronze on their respective world championship debuts, with Brazil's Carol Santiago, 40, beating them to the finish.

According to new developments, Liverpool fans paid tribute to Diogo Jota during the Community Shield meeting with Crystal Palace on Sunday

A moment of silence in memory of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva will be held at all Premier League matches this weekend.

Players will also wear black armbands, while messages and images will be shown on the big screens in stadiums.

Former Liverpool and Wolves forward Jota died at the age of 28 in a car crash in northern Spain last month alongside his brother, who was 25.

Tributes were paid to them before Liverpool's first match of the season, against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield on Sunday.

The Reds' record goalscorer Ian Rush, Palace chairman Steve Parish and Football Association chair Debbie Hewitt laid wreaths at the Liverpool end of Wembley before the game as fans sang a rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.

A minute's silence was cut short when supporters booed shouts coming from where the Palace fans were located. Reds boss Arne Slot said after the game that he believed the interruption to be accidental.

Liverpool and Wolves both have tributes planned for their Premier League openers against Bournemouth and Manchester City respectively this weekend.

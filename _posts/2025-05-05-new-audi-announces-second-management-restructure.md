According to new developments, Mattia Binotto - who joined Audi in July 2024 - becomes head of Audi F1 project

Audi has restructured the management of its Formula 1 team for the second time in less than a year before its official appearance on the grid next season.

Mattia Binotto, previously chief operating and technical officer, has been made head of Audi F1 project, while chief executive officer Adam Baker has left the company.

A spokesperson for Audi said the move made the structure of engine and chassis departments "clearer and streamlined".

Binotto joined Audi in July last year in a reorganisation that removed its former F1 chief executive officer Andreas Seidl, who had been recruited from McLaren, where he was team principal, at the end of 2022. 

The spokesperson said that, with Binotto in place, it became apparent over time that the CEO role had "become obsolete".

The Audi project is split over two sites. The power-unit base is in Neuburg an der Donau in Germany and the car design and manufacturing base - currently competing in F1 as Sauber under Audi ownership - is in Hinwil in Switzerland.

Audi will formally enter F1 in 2026, when new engine rules that attracted the company come into force. These increase the amount of power provided by the electrical component of the engine to about 50%.

The company is also looking for a base in England in which to house a small part of the design team so Audi can tap into the expertise in the so-called "motorsport valley" in south-east England. 

The responsibilities of Binotto and team principal Jonathan Wheatley will not change under the new structure.

Binotto is in overall charge of chassis and engine design and manufacture, while Wheatley runs the team once the car leaves the factory for races. Wheatley was recruited from Red Bull, where he had been sporting director, and began work at Sauber at the third race of this season, the Japanese Grand Prix last month.

Audi has also appointed a new chief operating officer, Christian Foyer, to take over the responsibilities on the engine side previously held by Baker.

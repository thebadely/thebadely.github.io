According to new developments, The public need to stop watching Netflix, "get out of their homes" and go to the pub for a drink to save struggling businesses, the Welsh first minister says.

Eluned Morgan spoke in Wales' parliament, the Senedd, after her government announced a one-year business rate discount of 15% for pubs, restaurants, cafes and live music venues.

She came under fire over how her government taxes companies, and replied that the state could not be expected to "step in" and do the work of people not using hospitality businesses.

Opposition leaders accused Morgan of blaming others instead of taking responsibility for the difficulties facing the sector.

The Welsh plans for business rate cuts are two years shorter than a similar scheme in England for pubs and live music venues.

The UK government's English scheme will see pubs get a 15% discount from April, and their business rates frozen for a further two years.

The Welsh government's business rate regime came in for criticism on Tuesday from  Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth, who told the Senedd the "hospitality sector is facing an existential crisis" and the system needed "urgent and radical change".

Morgan replied: "If people want to see those businesses succeed, they need to use them. 

"They need to stop buying things online. They need to get out of their homes and stop watching Netflix.

"They need to stop buying that bottle of wine at home and go out to the pub. That is the reality of what's happening here. 

"You can't expect the state to step in and do the work that the public should be doing."

Later, ap Iorwerth said: "This is a first minister that is completely out of touch - she has form for blaming others instead of taking responsibility for the government's own failures."

Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Darren Millar said Morgan "has tried to blame Brexit and Donald Trump for Wales' economic woes, now she's blaming Welsh citizens and Netflix".

Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said: "People are not willingly choosing Netflix over the high street. They are being forced indoors because prices keep rising and wages are not."

Reform said it was "Labour, not Netflix, that is causing pub closures".

Asked why the its scheme was for a single year, the Welsh government said decisions for 2027/28 and beyond will be for the next Senedd. Wales goes to the polls in just three months time.

Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said ministers know hospitality and music venues are "facing real pressures, from rising costs to changing consumer habits" and the cut would help 4,400 businesses.

It comes after complaints that rising property valuations have left some Welsh companies facing sharp increases in their bills.

The UK government's decision to cut rates in England also followed a backlash against its November budget which left many facing major increases, and led to more than a thousand pubs banning Labour MPs from their premises.

Business rates in Wales are controlled by the Welsh government and collected by local councils.

Trade body UKHospitality Cymru welcomed the inclusion of restaurants and cafes in the Welsh scheme, but said it was "notable" it was for one year only.

"Rates bills will still be going up year-on-year, even for those receiving relief, and hotels, which were facing the biggest increases, have been excluded completely," it added.

Chris Charters, director of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Wales, welcomed the rate discount - but said the revaluation in property values "could still lead to more of our locals in Wales being forced to close for good".

The comments by Morgan followed a clash with the Senedd's Tory leader Millar, where he accused her of not giving a "straight answer" over whether Labour would rule out income tax rises after the next Senedd election.

When asked, the first minister said it will be made clear in her manifesto.

"Your plan is simply to follow Plaid Cymru's lead, to reach your hands deeper into the pockets of those hard-working people," he said.

Morgan said: "You want to cut the basic rates of income tax? Then you have to tell people that they will have to wait longer for those waiting lists to come down."

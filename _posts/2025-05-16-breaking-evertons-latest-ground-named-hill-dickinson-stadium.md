Experts revealed that Construction began on Everton's long-awaited new stadium in August 2021

Liverpool-based legal firm Hill Dickinson is the naming rights partner for Everton's new stadium.

The new arena will be named the Hill Dickinson Stadium after the company, which has its headquarters in the city.

Everton told BBC Sport that the agreement is financially one of the largest stadium naming rights deals in Europe.

They will move to the new ground at Bramley-Moore Dock for the start of the 2025-26 season, leaving their current home of Goodison Park.

Everton men's team will play their final match at their old stadium on Sunday when they host Southampton in the Premier League.

The club's women's team will move into Goodison Park as their permanent home from the start of next campaign.

With a capacity of 52,888, the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock will officially open in August.

Test events have already been held at the ground, including the first football match there between the under-18 teams of Everton and Wigan.

Everton said the partnership with Hill Dickinson, which was founded in 1810 - 68 years before the football club - is "aâ¯ long-term agreement".

Hill Dickinson chief executive officer Craig Scott said:â¯"To put our name to Everton's new stadium is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.

"We believe deeply in what this project stands for - a bold, transformational vision for Liverpool and its future."

Phil: Love it, a proper company with a long-term commitment.  Everton moving up!

Niamh: We don't like it and we prefer Bramley-Moore. The new stadium name highlights how society has become obsessed with economic opportunity where instead football should be a social and cultural celebration rather than a liquified commodity.

Steve: Not a great name, but I think after all these years, it'll be continued to be called Bramley-Moore either way.

Geoff: Not sure about the new name. The deal might be worth big money but the name sets us up for endless mickey taking on the sponsors name. Surely it shouldn't be just about who stumps up the most cash? We have to live with this name until the deal runs out. Just ask Bolton fans.

Dan: Sounds just like a Football Manager regen name - but I quite like it.

Paul: Not a great choice. What about the Dixie Dean Stadium or something better?

Noel: I knew this new name would come as a shock to a lot of fans, however, it sounds professional and will grow on us all. Embrace the phoenix rising from the ashes. It's up to all of us fans to get on board, stick together and make this opportunity a big success story.

Sydney: Think it's a big let down from an iconic name of Goodison Park to Hill Dickinson. First big thing they had to get right and they messed it up. What a let down regardless of what money they paid for the privilege.

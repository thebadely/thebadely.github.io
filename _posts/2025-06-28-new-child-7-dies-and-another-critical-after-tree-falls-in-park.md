Let's dive into the details: A child has died and another is in critical condition after a tree fell in a park.

Essex Police were called to Chalkwell Park in Southend-on-Sea to reports that "a number of children were caught beneath the tree and suffered injuries". 

Five children were taken to hospital, but the force later confirmed that a seven-year-old girl had died and her family were being supported by officers. 

It added that another girl, six, suffered serious injuries and was in a critical condition.

Three other children sustained minor injuries and were being treated in hospital. 

Police said investigations were continuing at the park to establish the circumstances around this incident.

Ch SuptLeighton Hammett said: "Families are facing unimaginable hardship this evening and all of our thoughts are with them at this time.

"I cannot begin to put into words how difficult today's events have been, and continue to be, for them. It's also not lost on me how traumatic it must have been for the members of the public who witnessed this awful incident.

"Across a matter of moments, many of them went from enjoying the warm summer weather to rushing to the aid of strangers without a second thought."

He continued: "They showed the best of Southend today, and I'm sorry this update does not bring them more positive news.

"My officers, and our partners with the ambulance and fire service, did all they could to help the two injured children. Today's loss is one they will all take personally."

He added that support would be put in place for emergency service responders who went to the incident.

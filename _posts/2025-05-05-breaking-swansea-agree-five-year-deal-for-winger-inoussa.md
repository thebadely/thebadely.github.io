According to new developments, Zeidane Inoussa has played for Sweden at various age-grade levels

Swansea City have agreed a deal to sign winger Zeidane Inoussa from Swedish club BK Hacken.

The Championship club have not disclosed the fee for the first signing of the Alan Sheehan era, but it is understood to be 'significant'.

"It's important that we carry this season's momentum into next, and getting our first signing done this early is great," said boss Sheehan.

The 22-year-old will sign a five-year contract which will take effect on 1 July.

"I'm looking forward to working with Zeidane," added the Swans' recently upgraded permanent head coach.

"We want to be an aggressive team with and without the ball, and we believe he has all the attributes to do that and to make us better."

A Sweden Under-21 international, Inoussa left his homeland to join Caen as a teenager and got his first taste of senior football with the French club.

He had loan spells with Real Murcia and Valencia's second-string side before returning to Sweden to play for Brommapojkarna in 2023.

Inoussa moved to Gothenburg-club Hacken last year and has since scored nine goals in 23 appearances and had been linked with a number of clubs including Celtic.

Swansea director of football, Richard Montague, said: "Zeidane gives us something different to what we've had this season. We hope that he's a player who will get fans off their seats. 

"We're delighted to have completed this deal so early, and we believe it will help us to hit the ground running in August."

Inoussa will be joined in Wales this summer by fellow countryman Melker Widell, who agreed a move in the last transfer window.

Swansea are also lining up a move for Kilmarnock striker Bobby Wales.

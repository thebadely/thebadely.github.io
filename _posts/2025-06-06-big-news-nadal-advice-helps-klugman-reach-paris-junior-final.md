It has been recently reported that Britain's Hannah Klugman will compete in her first Grand Slam junior singles final

French Open 2025

Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros

Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app

Hannah Klugman became the first British player in almost 50 years to reach a French Open junior singles final - and credited a birthday chat with Rafael Nadal for inspiring her.

The 16-year-old fought back to win 1-6 6-3 6-3 against 18-year-old Bulgarian Rositsa Dencheva on the Roland Garros clay.

Klugman went to Nadal's academy earlier this year and says the advice she received from the 14-time French Open champion has contributed to her success.

"It was amazing to go there and meet him," Klugman told BBC Sport.

"He's my idol - I love Rafa. He said some amazing things to me.

"I struggled a bit last year and he said 'as soon as you've got the level, everything will come. So just trust it and work hard every day'."

Spending a couple of days at the academy in Majorca - and meeting 22-time major champion Nadal on her birthday - was part of a two-month stint getting to grips with clay-court tennis.

Klugman's preparation has led to the Roland Garros girls' final, where she will play Austria's Lilli Tagger on Saturday for the trophy.

She is aiming to emulate Britain's Michelle Tyler, who won the French Open girls' title in 1976.

"I'm just a bit shocked, to be honest," Klugman said after her semi-final win.

"I wasn't playing my best and I found it tough to get myself into the match.

"I felt like as soon as I did that I was in a good space and I thought I could do well if I got into the match."

It is a first Grand Slam girls' singles final for the highly-rated Klugman, who already has some impressive results to her name.

Born in London and raised in Wimbledon, the junior world number 13 shot to wider prominence by winning the Orange Bowl junior championships in Florida at the age of 14.

Past winners of the Orange Bowl include French Open finalist Coco Gauff, as well as Grand Slam champions Chris Evert, Caroline Wozniacki and Bianca Andreescu.

Klugman has also contested two Grand Slam girls' doubles finals, losing the 2023 Wimbledon and this year's Australian Open trophy matches.

"I think I've been mentally very good this week. I think I'm staying calm in big moments, and also just trying to take it in," Klugman added.

"These moments don't happen a lot, so trying to enjoy it is a big part.

"My coach and physio are basically saying go out there and enjoy it because you might never be in the spot again."

It has been recently reported that Is this AI's worst prediction yet?

Chris Sutton's guest this week, actor Ãanna Hardwicke, plays Roy Keane in Saipan - a new film about the former Manchester United captain's infamous fallout with Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy before the 2002 World Cup. It is in cinemas from Friday.

Naturally, we asked AI who would play Sutton if a film were ever made about him.

The best fit, apparently, is Hollywood heartthrob Tom Hardy, who is four inches shorter than BBC Sport football expert Sutton but is AI's top choice for the role because he is "known for portraying tough, brooding characters with emotional depth".

"That just shows how way off the mark AI is," said Sutton.

"But I'm happy with Tom Hardy, even though he is not tall enough. Most people would probably say I am more like Laurel and Hardy though."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

Hardwicke, who supports Aston Villa, is his guest for week 23.

Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

The disagreement between McCarthy and Keane caused huge controversy in Irish society over who was to blame, and despite the best efforts of former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern, the duo could not resolve their differences before the tournament started, leading Keane to miss the World Cup.

"I always think it was more subtle and grey than sometimes it gets portrayed," Hardwicke told BBC Sport.

"Sometimes it gets simplified as the clash between the person who wanted to win at all costs - Roy - and the person who had more of a 'we're happy to be here' approach - Mick.

"I think it is way more complex than that. Roy's commitment to excellence and absolute rigour is inspiring - he is such a symbol of the way the professionalism in football changed in the 1990s and 2000s, moving away from the pub culture that had existed.

"But Mick had a fantastic playing career too, as probably the most successful Ireland captain, and then was maybe behind Jack Charlton as the second-most successful Ireland manager.

"So, he knew how to win and he knew how to get the best out of a team. That is a really important thing to distinguish because they both wanted to win - they just had different ways of going about it.

"In a way, there is a Greek tragedy element to the situation because they are both on these different tracks, which both lead to one place. So it was always bound to end up where it did.

"I came out of the screening in Cork [where he and Keane were both born] and it was so satisfying to hear very different reactions, all very close to the skin. Some people were saying they were completely with Roy in this moment, while others were totally on Mick's side.

"It makes this more than just a sports story. We all maybe identify with one of them more than the other, depending on who you are as a person."

Chris Sutton and Ãanna Hardwicke were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.

Hardwicke studied hours of footage of interviews and action to prepare for playing Keane. "The easiest part of your job, if you like that kind of work, is taking in the voice and the physicality," he explained. "But more important is sort of creating and embodying the unseen parts of his life and trying to get under that skin. Obviously that can only ever be your interpretation."

London Stadium, 12:30 GMT

Sunderland's 3-0 win over West Ham on the opening weekend really set the tone for both teams' seasons, but it doesn't really help me much here.

The Hammers' win at Tottenham last week was extraordinary given their form going into that game, but their home record is still extremely poor.

Sunderland, meanwhile, are not the same force on the road as they are at the Stadium of Light, and they have not won away since the end of October.

Still, it has been such a strange season, with everyone beating everyone, that form, history, tables and stats are not really much help with these predictions anyway.

In the past few weeks, I have thought too much about AI and gone down the stat route to try to beat it at its own game, but that's not how I won the predictions title in previous seasons. 

I need to go with my gut instinct more, and that's what I'm doing here.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Hardwicke's prediction: I'm an Aston Villa fan but I've got a bit of affinity with Sunderland. 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-1

Turf Moor, 15:00

I am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live with Ian Dennis and it is another tricky one to call.

Tottenham boss Thomas Frank really needed Tuesday's win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League but he is still under pressure, and this is not an easy game for Spurs either.

When Liverpool went 1-0 up against Burnley last week and were creating loads of chances, I thought I was on for an exact score - I'd gone for a 2-0 Reds win.

I couldn't believe it when Burnley equalised but that result sums them up, because they are still scrapping for survival at the bottom of the table, and fighting hard in every game.

It is unlikely they are going to stay up from here, but it is not impossible. They probably need another five or six wins from their last 16 games - and they have had only three so far from their first 22.

Their home games are going to be crucial to get them to safety, so this almost feels must-win for Scott Parker's side, even at this stage.

The Clarets have been competitive against everyone so far, including at Anfield last week, but I still don't see them getting the result they need.

This is going be a very tight game and it smells of a 1-1 to me, but we have already had 17 goalless draws in the Premier League this season, so I am going on trend and picking another one here.

That should guarantee we see a few goals now. I have got Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario in my fantasy team, so I am asking for trouble really.

Sutton's prediction: 0-0

Hardwicke's prediction: Burnley have still got something to fight for so I am going to back them to get something here. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Craven Cottage, 15:00

These two sides are next to each other in the table in 11th and 12th, and drew 1-1 at the start of the season, so you know this is going to be close.

Fulham will have Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze and Calvin Bassey back from the Africa Cup of Nations, and I am not reading too much into their last-gasp defeat at Leeds last week anyhow.

Brighton will create chances - they always do - and I am expecting them to score, but Fulham won this game 3-1 last season with Iwobi scoring twice and I am going for them again this time.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Hardwicke's prediction: Fulham are doing really well. 2-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

Etihad Stadium, 15:00

Erling Haaland has not scored in open play in any of Manchester City's past eight games - only finding the net with a penalty against Brighton.

But his poor form is not City's only problem. They froze in the Arctic Circle on Tuesday - I was at that game for 5 Live and Bodo/Glimt thoroughly deserved their win.

It was a terrible result for City because now they are out of the top eight in the Champions League and, with a squad ravaged by injury, they are facing the prospect of two extra games in the play-offs.

Still, new signing Marc Guehi can play in this game to bring some stability to their backline and Antoine Semenyo will be back to add some spark to their attack too.

And, while Wolves have been rejuvenated recently and are four games unbeaten in the league, I feel like there will be some anger in City's performance after such a disappointing week.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Hardwicke's prediction: Haaland will have a good day out! 4-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Vitality Stadium, 17:30

Liverpool played really well against Marseille on Wednesday but I have a feeling they will find this game a lot more difficult.

Mind you, Bournemouth are a nightmare to predict this season so, whatever I say here, the opposite is likely to happen. 

I have changed my mind a few times about this one - I started with a 1-1 draw, then went 2-1 to Bournemouth... but then I saw Liverpool have won on their past three visits here and a repeat result is what I have talked myself into in the end.

It should be a great game, though, whatever the outcome. 

The Cherries are brilliantly strange, and I always think they have a goal in them - they will score here and have a real go at Liverpool, but I don't think they will quite get over the line.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Hardwicke's prediction: What happened with Mohamed Salah and Arne Slot before Christmas showed that players still fall out with their managers now, just like Roy did! 

Salah is back in the fold now - but however you deal with it, there is no way of knowing, as a manager, if you will get it right. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-3

Gtech Community Stadium, 14:00

It's the teams beginning with B that I am struggling most with this season - I don't seem able to predict what Brentford, Brighton or Bournemouth will do. I am not confident about getting Brentford right this time either.

On paper, this seems pretty straightforward because they are so strong at home and Igor Thiago is in brilliant form, but I can see Nottingham Forest making it difficult for them because of the way they play.

From what I've seen of Brentford this season, their gameplan is to keep it tight and look to counter quickly but Forest will do exactly the same.

With Sean Dyche's side being so deep, they won't leave any space behind and they will also be looking to score on the break.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Hardwicke's prediction: Brentford are flying at the moment. 2-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

Selhurst Park, 14:00

The wheels seem to be coming off in a big way at Palace. Marc Guehi has joined Manchester City, Oliver Glasner has hit out at the club's owners after announcing he will leave and now Jean-Philippe Mateta wants away.

It feels as if Glasner does not want to be there and although he seems to have been forgiven for his outburst about the club's hierarchy after defeat at Sunderland last weekend, I just don't think he is going to be around much longer.

Things are far from rosy for Chelsea at the moment either, and I feel a bit sorry for their manager Liam Rosenior. He is getting a kicking in certain places for some of his techniques and because he has come from Strasbourg, and I think that is unfair.

He's an innovative young manager who has done well for himself, and is hungry and ambitious.

If he was a young continental coach, we would be saying this guy is marvellous. Let's give him a chance.

I don't see everything going smoothly for Rosenior this season, but Chelsea got over the line in the Champions League in midweek and I think they will do the same at Selhurst Park. 

I just don't know where Palace go from here, and it is really sad. 

Maybe the end will come quickly for Glasner, but he cannot continue to show his frustration publicly every week or two, because that is not going to move the club forward.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Hardwicke's prediction: I can see some goals here. 3-2

AI's prediction: 0-2

St James' Park, 14:00

Aston Villa's home defeat by Everton last week showed again how difficult it is to make predictions this season.

Villa had won their past 11 home games before then, and had been pretty dominant against Everton in the league in recent seasons too. I was extremely confident they would win to keep the pressure on Arsenal... and I was wrong!

Now? Well, Unai Emery's side have a long trip to Turkey in the Europa League before this game and they have a few injuries to contend with too. John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara will be badly missed and I am slightly concerned about their options up front now Donyell Malen has left.

That's why I'm backing Newcastle here. They are so strong in midfield but they are especially good at home - I always fancy them to win at St James' Park.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Hardwicke on why he supports Villa: It was completely by chance. My brothers were at their first football match in the early 1990s, and it was Oxford United against Villa - they were with a relative who was an Oxford fan. 

Villa were a big team then with lots of Irish players like Steve Staunton and Paul McGrath, so they went 'OK, we are Villa!' And I copied them. We have no connection with Birmingham at all, but I am very happy to have inherited that - although one of my brothers is now a Liverpool fan, and the other one doesn't care.

Hardwicke's prediction: Villa are probably one of the most in-form teams in the world over the past couple of months. I am just the biggest fan of Unai Emery - he is an amazing coach and he typifies all that is great about the game. 

We hardly spent anything in the summer and a lot of fans were grumbling - I was one of them - but what we are doing just goes to show what Emery has built, and with a crop of young players. This will be a tough game for us, but we will win. 2-3

AI's prediction: 2-2

Emirates Stadium, 16:30

Manchester United were brilliant under Michael Carrick in the Manchester derby. They totally deserved their win.

Carrick has talked about finding some consistency to back up that performance and result but, even if they play well again here, it's a huge ask for them to go to the Emirates and get something.

Arsenal dropped points against Nottingham Forest last time out in the Premier League but it still turned out to be a good weekend for them.

I don't see Mikel Arteta's side slipping up this time. It will be fascinating to see if the 'Carrick effect' can last but even when Arsenal make changes I always think they will get the job done.

Carrick had a plan for playing against City and it worked. He might have an idea about stopping Arsenal in open play too, but then United will still have their set-pieces to deal with.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Hardwicke's prediction: Roy would have been at front and centre of anything that happened in this game in the past! That clip of him and Patrick Vieira in the tunnel [in 2005] is amazing. If he was playing for United, he wouldn't be happy with my prediction, either! 2-1

AI's prediction: 3-1

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 20:00

I'm definitely adding Everton to my list of teams who are impossible to predict. They've had some brilliant results this season, and some really disappointing ones too.

They will be without the injured Jack Grealish here but they were depleted against Villa last time out and they were brilliant in that game.

Thierno Barry took his goal ever so well for their winner. I know it was close in but it was still a lovely finish. 

When you watch Barry closely, he is frustrating sometimes but he is a real nuisance and he is so good in the air. I was impressed by Harrison Armstrong and Merlin Rohl as well, and having Iliman Ndiaye back after winning the Afcon with Senegal will lift Everton too.

Leeds beat Everton 1-0 at Elland Road with a late penalty at the start of the season, and this game will be just as tight.

I was going to go for an Everton win by the same scoreline but then I thought about Dominic Calvert-Lewin coming back to his old club. He is bound to score, isn't he?

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Hardwicke's prediction: 3-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Chris got four correct results from the 10 Premier League matches in week 22 with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.

He beat AI, which managed only two correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 20 points, but not his guest, WWE superstar Drew McIntyre.

Drew also managed four correct scores but that included one exact score, meaning he ended up on 70 points.

The weekly win, however, went to the BBC readers. They managed three correct scores but had two exact results, giving them 90 points.

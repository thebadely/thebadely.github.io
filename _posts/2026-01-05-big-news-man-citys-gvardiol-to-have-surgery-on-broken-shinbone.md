According to new developments, Josko Gvardiol was withdrawn after 51 minutes against Chelsea on Sunday

Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol will have surgery later this week after breaking his shinbone in Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw with Chelsea. 

Croatia international Gvardiol, 23, was withdrawn after 51 minutes against Chelsea, while his fellow central defender Ruben Dias also went off injured half an hour later. 

In a statement, City said they were still trying to "ascertain the full extent" of Gvardiol's injury and his expected recovery time.

In a post on Instagram,, external Gvardiol thanked fans for their support and wrote: "This is a hard moment, but it will never define me. I know who I am and where I come from."

He added: "I'll fight every day to return stronger. I will rise again, better than ever."

Meanwhile, City have recalled academy product Max Alleyne from his loan spell at Championship side Watford and he could be involved in the squad for Wednesday's Premier League game against Brighton.

The 20-year-old - son of former England cricketer and current Gloucestershire head coach Mark Alleyne - made 17 appearances for the Hornets after joining on a season's loan. 

But with England centre-back John Stones also currently sidelined, that deal has been cut short as Pep Guardiola's side, who are exploring a January move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, try to tackle their growing injury crisis in defence.

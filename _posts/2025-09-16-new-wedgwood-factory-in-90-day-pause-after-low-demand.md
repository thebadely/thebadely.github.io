Here’s what you need to know: Ceramics firm Wedgwood is to pause production at its Staffordshire factory for 90 days at the end of the month, with 70 employees put on temporary leave.

Owner Fiskars Group confirmed the temporary shutdown would start at Barlaston on 29 September, and was happening "to address elevated inventory levels caused by lower consumer demand in some of our key markets".

Factory tours will also be suspended until "early January", a Fiskars Group spokesperson said.

They added Barlaston and its community were of "key importance" to both Fiskars Group and Wedgwood and had an "enduring role in heritage and operations".

The site produces high-end and bespoke designs, including handcrafted fine bone china pieces and Jasperware, a type of pottery developed in the 18th Century by founder Josiah Wedgwood.

Skilled workers still use techniques pioneered by the firm's founder, the spokesperson said, adding: "This living tradition reflects our commitment to craftsmanship."

A message to prospective visitors on the World of Wedgwood site stated factory tours were suspended until 5 January, but other on-site experiences remained open.

A spokesperson for the GMB Union said workers would continue to receive full pay and be supported during the pause.

The announcement from Wedgwood came as artists and enthusiasts continued to flock to Stoke-on-Trent for the British Ceramics Biennial - the largest ceramics showcase in the UK.

Tom Hammersley, marketing manager at Staffordshire Chambers of Commerce, said he was concerned about the drop in demand, which came against a backdrop of increasing costs. 

"Wedgwood has huge global demand in areas including China and Japan. If that demand is slowing, and married with the increasing costs, it is a huge concern." 

He said it was important to remember the pause was a "temporary measure" and Wedgwood was still an important part of the local economy.  

Dr Allison Gardner, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, said she wanted to reassure people that it was "not something to worry about". 

"This is a simple response to seasonal fluctuations," she said. "I will of course keep monitoring the situation and keep in contact with the company and trade unions as I always do." 

But Gareth Snell, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, described it as "incredibly worrying" and said it further highlighted the need for support for the ceramics industry.

"The support cannot be in some distant future or the promise of help tomorrow but real help today," the Labour man said.

Pottery workers in Stoke-on-Trent have been campaigning for more government support recently after three firms - Royal Stafford, Moorcroft and Heraldic Pottery - collapsed this year, citing increased costs.

Moorcroft, based in Cobridge, has since been purchased by the founder's grandson.

A spokesperson for Stoke-on-Trent City Council said they were aware of Wedgwood's temporary shutdown as well as the concern it would cause for staff and the wider community.

"Wedgwood is not only an important local heritage brand but an important visitor destination," they said.

"The fact is global and national pressures – including high energy prices – have made life very difficult for manufacturers."

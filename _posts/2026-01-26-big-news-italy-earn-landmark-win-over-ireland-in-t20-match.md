Italy secured their first win over a full ICC member as they inflicted a four-wicket defeat on Ireland in the third of the T20 World Cup warm-up matches between the sides in Dubai on Monday.

Ireland had already tied up the three-match series 2-0 after winning the first two games the sides contested on Friday and Sunday.

Opener Paul Stirling laid the foundations for Ireland's total of 154 all out off 19.4 overs with a contribution of 45 which included three sixes and two fours. 

He was ably assisted by middle order contributions of 25 and 22 from Mark Adair and Ben Calitz respectively.

Ireland's final four wickets fell for just 16 runs in the space of two overs as their innings ended with two balls still to be bowled.

Crishan Kalugamage was the pick of the Italy bowlers with 3-28, while Grant Stewart and JJ Smuts took two wickets apiece.

Italy's response was a stuttering one, Wayne Madsen contributing best of the top order batters with 39, before his dismissal left his side on 108-5. 

Gian-Piero Meade followed soon after with the score on 111, leaving his side requiring 44 from 23 balls to win.

A seventh-wicket partnership of 46 between Stewart (33 off 19 balls) and Marcus Campopiano (8) however was enough to see the Italians over the line with three deliveries to spare.

Matthew Humphreys and Mark Adair ended with identical bowling returns of 2-23 from four overs each.

The series in the United Arab Emirates formed part of both teams' preparations for the T20 World Cup in February.

Ireland will face co-hosts Sri Lanka in their World Cup opener on 8 February and will also meet Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe in Group B.

First-time qualifiers Italy will open their campaign against Scotland on 9 February, with England, West Indies and Nepal the other teams in Group C.

Before the start of the tournament, Ireland remain in Dubai for a two-match series against the UAE, the first match taking place on Thursday and the second on Saturday.

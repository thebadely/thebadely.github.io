Experts revealed that Liam Rosenior will be taking charge of Chelsea for the first time when they visit Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup

Liam Rosenior wants to emulate "brave" Sir Alex Ferguson with a young Chelsea squad he believes has the potential to grow like Manchester United's famous Class of '92.

The 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca as head coach of the Blues after the Italian left his role on New Year's Day.

Maresca had complained of pressure to select certain players - senior figures insist he was only asked to limit minutes for those carrying injuries - and highlighted the challenge of sustained success with the Premier League's youngest squad, whose starting XIs have averaged 24 years and 198 days this season.

But Rosenior will relish the opportunity to shape successful futures for an exciting crop of talent - just like Ferguson did during his trophy-laden reign at Old Trafford.

"I was a Manchester United fan and I am now massively a Chelsea fan," said Rosenior.

"I remember Sir Alex Ferguson was brave enough to put six or seven players aged between 19 and 21 into a title-winning team because he believed in them.

"They grew and won trophy after trophy. It was an amazing period in that club's history. Without that bravery, it doesn't happen. There is potential for that here."

United legends, such as Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil and Gary Neville, famously became known as the Class of '92 as they came through the youth ranks to win multiple major honours with the club under Ferguson.

"Speak about Moises Caicedo or Enzo Fernandez or Cole Palmer or Reece James - world-class players and still very, very young," added Rosenior.

"That is the ultimate ambition for this club - to create that again."

Chelsea appointed Rosenior after 18 months at Strasbourg, who are part of the same Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital multi-club ownership group. 

The French side fielded the youngest squad in Europe's big five leagues last season, averaging 21 years and 171 days, and finished seventh - just three points off the Champions League places, but qualified for Europe for the first time in eight years.

"If you watched the Strasbourg team I coached, everyone enjoyed watching them because they played with intensity," said Rosenior. "Why? Because they were young, fit, less prone to injury. I'm going to work really hard to create that here.

"I have to train the players right, work with the medical team and look after them because they have outstanding careers ahead. But that doesn't stop you being successful now. If I thought it was impossible to win with this group, I wouldn't have come."

I've worked so hard for this opportunity - Rosenior

Rosenior watched from the stands as Chelsea suffered a 2-1 defeat at Fulham on Wednesday, leaving the Blues eighth in the table with just one win in nine Premier League matches.

There were chants against the ownership during the game and a banner reading 'BlueCo out'. Hours after Rosenior's appointment the previous day, the Chelsea Supporters' Trust published a critical survey - aimed at the club's leadership rather than the new head coach. 

More than half of those who responded said they doubted Chelsea could achieve success in the next three to five years under the current regime, while a similar proportion lacked confidence in the ownership's decision-making.

Chelsea's model, built around young players on long contracts and overseen by five sporting directors - Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Sam Jewell, Dave Fallows and Joe Shields - alongside influential owner Behdad Eghbali, has come under scrutiny. 

Maresca's willingness to leave mid-season forced a managerial change the club had not planned to make until an end-of-season review.

Rosenior, however, believes in the club's approach, having worked under the same structure at Strasbourg.

"I have a very good professional relationship with the guys," he said. "I understand what they want, where they want to get to and how they want to get there. That helps me deliver what they want. That's why I'm here. I believe we can be successful. It's not just about me - and we'll see in time if that's proven right.

"The project is about winning. It's about winning games and delivering trophies for Chelsea."

Asked whether he will have a say in transfers, Rosenior added: "I did not get one player brought in who I did not want at Strasbourg - not one. These guys have been magnificent for me. The process is how it should be at every club."

Born in west London, the former Fulham full-back wants to create a positive environment despite recent friction.

"Being a head coach, you talk about systems and tactics - that's 10% of the job,'"he said. "The job is to create spirit, energy and a culture."

Rosenior is still inexperienced, having managed Derby County and Hull City before joining Strasbourg in July 2024, and is yet to win a major trophy.

Chelsea's previous managers - Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte - all arrived with multiple honours.

Asked if he was an underwhelming appointment compared to those big names, Rosenior replied: "Everybody starts somewhere. There's a great quote from Mourinho - one of my heroes.

"He said it took him 20 years to become an overnight success. It's the same for anyone. You're not a name until you become a name."

His message to supporters was clear as he added: "Judge what you see, not what you hear. Judge what you see on the pitch. Don't judge my press conferences - I don't win any games here. Give me, my staff and my players the chance to prove we are worthy. Judge us and be fair.

"If the performances aren't good enough, I'll be the first to say it. I'm the most accountable person for our performances - but give us the chance."

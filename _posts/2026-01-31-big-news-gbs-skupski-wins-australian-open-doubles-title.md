Experts revealed that Christian Harrison (left) and Neal Skupski lost only one set in their six matches at the Australian Open

Great Britain's Neal Skupski and American partner Christian Harrison claimed the Australian Open men's doubles title in their first Grand Slam together.

Skupski, 36, and Harrison, 31, defeated Australian wildcards Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans 7-6 (7-4) 6-4.

Skupski and Harrison competed together for the first time in Adelaide just before the Australian Open, getting to the semi-finals.

Liverpudlian Skupski played with fellow Briton Joe Salisbury throughout 2025, reaching finals at the French Open and US Open, before Salisbury took a break from tennis because of anxiety.

"I'm thrilled to get over the line with Christian. He's an amazing player and we're really happy with each other and how [the partnership is] developing," Skuspki told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"You don't really know how a new partnership will work out but I knew Christian's game and I had an idea it could work.

"He keeps me going - he's a few years younger than me - so it's maybe what I needed."

It is a second Grand Slam men's doubles crown for Skupski, who won the Wimbledon title alongside Dutchman Wesley Koolhof in 2023.

It is also the third time in the past five Grand Slams that at least one British player has triumphed in the men's doubles.

Henry Patten won at last year's Australian Open alongside Finland's Harri Heliovaara, while the all-British pair of Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool were victorious at Wimbledon.

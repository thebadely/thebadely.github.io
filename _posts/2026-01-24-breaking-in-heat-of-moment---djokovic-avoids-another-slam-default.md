It has been recently reported that Novak Djokovic has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam singles titles at the Australian Open

Another reckless swipe of the racquet could have led to a horrible sense of deja vu for Novak Djokovic.

Back in 2020, Djokovic was disqualified from the US Open after accidentally hitting a line judge in the neck with a ball.

During his straight-set Australian Open win over Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp on Saturday - his 400th Grand Slam victory - Djokovic smacked another ball away from the court and risked a further ignominious default.

The 38-year-old was fortunate the fizzing forehand narrowly missed a ball girl who ducked out of the way as she crouched at the net post.

"I apologised for that. That was not necessary and in the heat of the moment. I was lucky there and I'm sorry for causing any distress to the ball kid or anybody," said Djokovic.

He was lucky. Another attempt at a record 25th major title could have been aborted by his own carelessness.

The ball girl's quick reactions may have saved Djokovic. If she had been hit, tournament referee Wayne McKewen would have had serious grounds on which to default the 24-time major champion.

While these were different circumstances to the US Open incident, the Grand Slam rulebook tells us why McKewen could have come to that conclusion.

"For the purposes of this rule, abuse of balls is defined as... hitting a ball dangerously or recklessly within the court or hitting a ball with negligent disregard of the consequences," it says.

"The referee in consultation with the Grand Slam supervisor may declare a default for either a single violation of this code or pursuant to the point penalty schedule."

The incident happened after 10-time champion Djokovic, leading 6-3 4-2 at the time, saw a pacy return from world number 75 Van de Zandschulp go long for deuce.

In a split-second, Djokovic casually hooked the ball left.

"I don't even think he knew the ball kid was there. But it was three inches from getting defaulted," said former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, who was analysing the third-round match for BBC Radio 5 Live.

"He's hit that in an area where nine times out of 10 is probably a default. He's managed somehow to sneak in between the ball kid and the spectators to the left."

In New York little over five years ago, it was a clear-cut case.

Djokovic took a ball out of his pocket and hit it behind him, striking the female line judge in her throat.

It was an infamous incident which the Serb swiftly apologised for, saying it had left him "really sad and empty".

Given he felt he needed to apologise again in Melbourne, many will question whether Djokovic has learned his lesson.

He also fell awkwardly during the third set and, shortly afterwards, received treatment for a blister on his right foot.

But ultimately Djokovic won in two hours and 44 minutes, keeping up his record of not yet dropping a set at this event, and a lighter workload could prove critical for his hopes of winning standalone record 25th Grand Slam singles title.

He will play Czech 16th seed Jakub Mensik in round four.

Stan Wawrinka has won three Grand Slam singles titles, including the Australian Open in 2014

While one veteran was extending his stay in Melbourne, another said farewell.

Stan Wawrinka, playing in his final Australian Open before he retires at the end of 2026, lost in four sets to American Taylor Fritz.

Swiss player Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, had been on court for almost eight hours across his first two matches as he became the first male player aged 40 or over to reach the third round at a Grand Slam for 48 years.

However, an upset win against the ninth seed proved beyond him.

"I had so many emotions here over the past 20 years," said 40-year-old Wawrinka, who was shown a video package of his best Australian Open moments before addressing the crowd.

"I won my first Grand Slam here and I've always had so much support. The reason I'm still playing is because of you and the love of the game.

"I'm sad to leave but it's been an amazing journey," he concluded, before retrieving two cans of beer from under his chair and toasting with tournament director Craig Tiley on court.

Fritz, who will play Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti in round four, said of Wawrinka: "It's amazing what he's out here doing. I have so much respect for the passion and drive it takes to be doing what he's done this week."

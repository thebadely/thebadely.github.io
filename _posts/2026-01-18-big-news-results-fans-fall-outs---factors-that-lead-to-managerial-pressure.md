Will Frank and Glasner see the season out with their clubs?

Pressure on the position of a football manager never tends to be far away.

That was evident in the Premier League this weekend, with Tottenham boss Thomas Frank and Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner both starting to feel the heat - for different reasons.

Frank's position is under threat after a run of poor results, while the outgoing Glasner has overseen a 10-game winless streak - but made the extraordinary claim after defeat by Sunderland that he feels "abandoned" by the club.

And to underline how quickly things can change, Arne Slot led Liverpool to the title in May, but saw his side booed off after Saturday's 1-1 draw with struggling Burnley.

The pressure has already proved too much for two top-flight managers this year, with Chelsea sacking Enzo Maresca on 1 January before Manchester United parted ways with Ruben Amorim five days into 2026.

Here, BBC Sport takes a look at the various factors that can lead to managers coming under intense scrutiny.

Spurs chiefs consider sacking Frank as fans turn

Glasner 'feels abandoned completely' at Palace

Tactics, transfers and turmoil - inside the fall of Amorim

What went wrong between Chelsea and Maresca?

Winning is the name of the game in football, so - unsurprisingly - a poor run of results is often the main factor in a manager getting the sack.

The ever-increasing finances involved in top-level football also mean owners sometimes do not feel they can take a risk of relegation or missing out on Europe.

That was a factor when Everton sacked Sean Dyche in January last year.

New owners the Friedkin Group - getting ready to move to their new Hill Dickinson Stadium - felt they could not risk losing out on Premier League money with relegation to the Championship.

With four games left in 2022-23 Leeds sacked Javi Gracia - after just 10 weeks in charge - and appointed Sam Allardyce in a bid to avoid the drop.

Relegation would have cost Leeds chairman Andrea Radrizzani Â£230m - and ultimately did.

A Â£400m deal to sell his stake in the club to co-owners 49ers Enterprises was dependent on top-flight survival... after relegation he sold it for Â£170m instead.

Ange Postecoglou lasted just 39 days at Nottingham Forest earlier this season

When managers lose the support of fans - particularly those in the ground - the writing is often on the wall for them.

Ange Postecoglou had only been in charge of Nottingham Forest for three weeks - and six games - when his own supporters started singing "sacked in the morning" to him.

The Australian lasted two more games before being fired 17 minutes after a defeat by Chelsea.

This weekend the pressure ramped up on Frank, with Spurs fans suggesting he would also be "sacked in the morning" during the 2-1 loss to West Ham.

Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney told BBC Match of the Day: "I felt for him - I have been in that position. It is a lonely position to be in. 

"The Tottenham fans have spoken and, when that happens, it looks like he will lose his job."

Ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer added:  "He knows the rules though, if you don't win games you are going to get sacked. He looked a very tired man by the end."

Former Stoke City boss Tony Pulis said in a BBC column: "In my experience, a lot of these [match-going] supporters have a great understanding and knowledge of their team and the players, and have the right to criticise. 

"Their reaction also has far more influence on the decision-makers at any club.

"So, if you hear criticism openly in your own stadium... it means you are in trouble and that results must start changing quite quickly."

Falling out with owners or other people in a club's hierarchy is always a problem too.

That played its part in Amorim's departure after the Portuguese criticised Manchester's United board in an explosive news conference after a 1-1 draw with Leeds.

He challenged club chiefs to let him do his job without interference, with earlier comments about the Red Devils' transfer strategy having hinted at possible friction behind the scenes.

The day after the Leeds match Amorim was sacked.

Maresca was dismissed after a poor run of results left Chelsea's top-four hopes in the balance - but he also paid the price for a disagreement with the hierarchy.

Nuno, meanwhile, led Forest into Europe last season but then fell out with owner Evangelos Marinakis over transfer dealings - and was axed.

Brendan Rodgers officially resigned as Celtic manager earlier this season - after a catastrophic breakdown in his relationship with the board.

And this weekend Glasner rounded on Palace's owners, saying he felt he and his players had been "abandoned completely" in a criticism of the Eagles' transfer strategy.

Glasner confirmed on Friday he will leave Palace when his contract expires at the end of the season - but whether his outburst accelerates his departure remains to be seen.

"I don't think there is a chance he can be there next weekend," Rooney said.

"Once you speak against the owners there is only one result."

How Maresca's tenure at Chelsea turned sour

While fans are often particularly vociferous in their criticism online, social media pressure is not often thought to be a factor in a managerial sacking.

Pulis said: "If fans on social media sites criticise a team, manager or club, it resonates in only a minor way compared to the effect of the same criticism from supporters who buy season tickets and spend their hard-earned cash and time watching and travelling home and away in all weathers."

However, social media often plays its part in pundits' remarks gaining traction - to the extent an under-fire manager may then feel the need to defend themselves.

Just before his exit, Amorim suggested people within Manchester United had become too sensitive to outside criticism, saying: "If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club."

There are plenty of occasions where a manager can come in for all kinds of abuse on social media - but then be supported by those who attend games. 

In 2021 there was huge pressure from Arsenal fans online to sack Mikel Arteta - and now they hope he is the man to lead them to their first league title in a generation.

Social media can also stop a manager getting a job.

Gennaro Gattuso was considered for the Tottenham job in 2021 but the club changed their mind after a social media campaign - and the trending hashtag #NoToGattuso.

So is the combination of factors outlined above having any impact on how much time managers are given?

Postecoglou's 39-day reign at Forest means he is the shortest-serving permanent boss in Premier League history, but it was only one day shorter than Les Reed's 2006 spell at Charlton.

Five of the top 10 briefest spells have been since 2020, while Colin Todd's stint at Derby dates back to 2001-02.

Of the 27 permanent Premier League managers appointed since the start of the 2023-24 season, 15 have left their clubs and 12 remain in charge.

'I'll take the stick' - Clarke on Scotland criticism

Scotland head coach Steve Clarke says Monday's friendly with Liechtenstein will not have "any bearing" on their quest to reach next summer's World Cup.

The national side face a team ranked 205th in the world in the second match of a friendly double header, after Friday's 3-1 humbling by Iceland at Hampden Park.

It was the second consecutive home game Scotland have lost and conceded three goals, and fans vented their frustration at full-time.

However, Clarke, who has guided Scotland to two European Championships, is confident his team will get it right come September, when their World Cup qualifiers get under way.

"Whatever happens tomorrow night is not going to have any bearing on the games in the autumn," Clarke said.

"As I said after the last game, it'd be nice to win and if we play well, it'd be nice to play well and win."

Neither Scott McTominay nor Kieran Tierney have travelled with Scotland due to slight injuries, with Clarke saying both carried knocks into the camp.

The Scotland head coach also revealed he has decided who will start in goal, after Cieran Slicker endured a tough debut against Iceland when he replaced Angus Gunn after just a few minutes, with Robby McCrorie also injured in the warm up.

Ross Doohan, who has just left Aberdeen, and 18-year-old Bournemouth goalkeeper Callan McKenna have been called up as replacements for Gunn and McCrorie.

"Cieran is a good goalkeeper," added Clarke, of the 22-year-old Ipswich player.

"He trains well, works well in the camp. He's had an unfortunate night and he'll bounce back from it.

"He knows he needs to play more games regularly but he's got a big future in front of him."

Clarke also added the team will be freshened up "a little bit more than I'd normally do".

This is Scotland's final game before they start World Cup qualification in September, with Denmark, Belarus, and Greece making up their group.

There are just five nations ranked below the microstate in the world rankings, including the US and British Virgin Islands and San Marino. And even the San Marinese have beaten Liechtenstein twice in the past year.

They have only won once in their last 48 matches - a 1-0 success over Hong Kong in a friendly last October - and have a squad mainly made up of home-based part-time players who perform in the lower reaches of the Swiss leagues.

In the Euro 2012 qualifiers, manager Craig Levein was made to sweat as a Stephen McManus header in the sixth minute of stoppage time at Hampden spared the Scots one of their most embarrassing ever results as they laboured to a 2-1 victory.

It was not exactly a routine win 13 months later in the return in Vaduz, with Craig Mackail-Smith's solitary Scotland goal settling it.

This one has shades of the friendly with Gibraltar 12 months ago, which was another stodgy affair and it may be similar this time round at the end of a long season. 

Regardless of the outcome, Clarke will have much to ponder before the trip to Copenhagen to face top seeds Denmark in the early autumn when the real stuff begins again.

Scotland have won both previous meetings with Liechtenstein, both in Euro 2012 qualification (2-1 home, 1-0 away).

Liechtenstein have won one of their last 76 matches against nations inside the top 100 (D7 L68), beating Luxembourg 2-1 in an October 2020 friendly.

Scotland have failed to win five of their last six against opponents ranked lower than them (D3 L2), having won 13 of their previous 15 (L2).

Liechtenstein are winless in their last 26 home games (D4 L22) since a 2-0 victory over Gibraltar in September 2018. They've scored in just one of their last 15 matches at home (a 3-1 loss to San Marino in November last year).

Scotland are looking to win three consecutive away games for the first time since November 2021.

This will be Clarke's 68th game in charge, which will see him move level with Jock Stein and behind only Craig Brown (71).

It has been recently reported that Fifa are promoting the 'Football Unites the World' campaign at the Club World Cup 

Campaigners have criticised Fifa after it appeared to drop anti-racism messaging at the Club World Cup, with some suggesting it may be connected to the policies of US President Donald Trump.

Fifa backed 'no discrimination' armbands at the Qatar 2022 World Cup and last month hailed a new disciplinary code "to fight racism more efficiently and decisively".

So far however, such sentiments seem to have been absent during matches at the revamped competition in the US, with the governing body instead promoting a 'Football Unites the World' campaign.

Fifa has not commented on a report in The Athletic, external that promotional material for a 'no racism' campaign was prepared for the Club World Cup, but then not used.

Piara Powar, executive director of campaign group body Fare, said: "It is disappointing that it appears there will be no anti-discrimination messaging throughout the Club World Cup.

"In the past such messaging has been well received by supporters, players and civil society. 

"It's more than a shame that a message of inclusion can't be broadcast to the world, and that those of us who are stakeholders in this area haven't been informed.

"We know that the US government is volatile and the need for pragmatism is a factor, but the iteration of consistent and progressive values by Fifa is so important."

Since assuming office in January, Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, and several large US companies have ended or scaled back theirs.

In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson said: "'Football Unites the World' is Fifa's main global campaign, which is displayed in all Club World Cup stadiums before and during the matches, as well as on Fifa's social platforms.

"Fifa has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism.

"This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the Fifa Council of the revised Fifa Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse - including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties.

"The three-step anti-discrimination procedure - a protocol designed to address and respond to discriminatory behaviour by empowering referees to take escalating action when such incidents occur among fans or participants â is also in effect at the Club World Cup.

"Fifa's social media protection service is also being made available to clubs, players, and officials.

"Further activities to reinforce Fifa's anti-discrimination stance will be implemented in due course."

Evan Whitfield, the chair of the Human Rights Soccer Alliance (HRSA), a US group of former players, lawyers and grassroots organisations, said: "We are disappointed that Fifa has taken a step back from the anti-discrimination messaging that was communicated at the last few global competitions.

"Soccer exists in a space where the values of non-discrimination and inclusion are clear, but they need to be consistently underlined to the world.

"A basic message of football unites the world doesn't achieve this clearly enough.

"Fifa is a global organisation that should have consistent values regardless of the country in which it organises competitions.

"If Fifa can have strong messaging in Russia, Qatar, New Zealand and Australia, then the same should apply in the United States. This is a soccer issue, regardless of the administration in power in the host country."

At the weekend, Los Angeles-based side Angel City wore shirts reading 'Immigrant City Football Club' before their National Women's Soccer League home game against North Carolina.

The players' show of support was a response to the ongoing raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the resulting protests in LA.

Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out said: "Fifa's apparent decision to drop its anti-discrimination messaging at the Club World Cup is concerning, especially after highlighting the importance of tackling the issue in its recent campaigns.

"As has been demonstrated by Angel City, football has a unique power in bringing communities together, and visibility of Fifa's anti-discrimination campaigns while the world is watching is crucial in helping this cause.

"We would urge Fifa to reverse its decision and sincerely hope this is not a sign of things to come at the World Cup next year."

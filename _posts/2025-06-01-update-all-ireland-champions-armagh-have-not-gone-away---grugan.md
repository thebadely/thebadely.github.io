Let's dive into the details: Grugan registered seven points in Armagh's victory against Dublin

Armagh forward Rory Grugan said that the All-Ireland champions "have not gone away" after their 0-24 to 0-19 victory against Dublin at Croke Park.

Their second victory in Group Four of the All-Ireland round-robin series, coupled with Galway's draw with Derry saw the Orchard County top the group and progress to the quarter-finals.

And Grugan believes their smooth passage through the so called 'group of death' will show critics they are well in the hunt to retain the Sam Maguire after losing the Ulster Championship final.

"A lot of people probably had us written off at the start of the year but we haven't gone away," he told RTE after being awarded man-of-the match against the Dubs. 

"After the disappointment of the Ulster final, coming to this group was daunting but we knew how important the first game was, and we produced a really good performance [in a win against Derry] and it meant we could really come at it here today. 

"We didn't know the other result would work that a win today would see us top the group but it's a good position to be to get that quarter final and that extra week's rest."

Armagh's efficiency in front of goal proved to be the difference and Grugan was pleased with their performance once they got over a slow start.

"I think we got to grips with the game after a shaky start. We knew Dublin were going to come at us hard, they were cutting through us, but we started to put a bit of control in the game and built a lead," he explained.

"They came fighting at us but maybe that bit of better conversion from our side won us the game."

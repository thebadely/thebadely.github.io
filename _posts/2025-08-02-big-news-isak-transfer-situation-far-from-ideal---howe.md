Isak transfer situation 'far from ideal' - Howe

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe says the transfer situation surrounding striker Alexander Isak is "complex" and "far from ideal".

Newcastle turned down a Â£110m bid from Liverpool for Isak on Friday, with the Magpies valuing him at about Â£150m.

The 25-year-old was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia with what the club described as a "minor" thigh issue.

The Sweden international subsequently trained alone at former club Real Sociedad - something Howe said he found out about through the media.

However, sources close to the situation have indicated Isak is due back in Newcastle on Saturday. He will be expected to report for training as normal.

"I think from my situation, I am very much removed from everything that is happening back home," Howe told a news conference, external on Saturday.

"I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down before I heard about it. There are people back in England dealing with the situation. 

"I really don't know what is going to happen next but, from our perspective, we still support Alex in every way and my wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again."

Isak joined Newcastle in a Â£60m move from La Liga side Sociedad in 2022.

He was the Magpies' top scorer last season as the club won the Carabao Cup and ended their 70-year wait for domestic silverware.

Howe said he is not in direct contact with the forward, adding: "I know where he is through the media, so I think from that perspective it's difficult for me to go into any detail.

"The situation is far from ideal. It is quite complex. I think that is all I have got to say."

Newcastle face Tottenham in Seoul on Sunday before returning home, with their first Premier League fixture on 16 August against Aston Villa.

Experts revealed that England will begin their Euro 2025 campaign against France on 5 July

England striker Alessia Russo says she prefers to stay off social media during major tournaments because of how "damaging" abuse can be.

The 26-year-old was speaking about the issue alongside her Lionesses team-mates as they prepare for their European Championship defence in Switzerland next month.

Their comments come after British tennis player Katie Boulter spoke to BBC Sport about abuse and death threats she has received online.

Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton, 22, says she will try to stay away from social media to avoid a "toxic environment", while Chelsea forward Lauren James said "the abuse never really stops".

"I think every player might have a different story about that side of the game but it's definitely one that can be really damaging," said Arsenal forward Russo, 26.

"I have faced it in the past and I think most players here have. When I was younger I probably got sucked into it more. 

"I read it more than I should have and listened to it more than I should have. The only opinions that matter are [those of] my team-mates, my coaches and my family.

"In my first Euros I was on social media and I would have a look, have a scroll, and I got caught in a trap sometimes.

"Going into the World Cup, I completely came off everything and I had people to run my Instagram. I just focused on the tournament.

"It's personal preference and whatever works for the team. Staying away from it and staying focused as a team is what works for me."

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast, James discussed abuse she received, saying: "Sometimes it's not even to do with my performance, even when someone loses at Fifa [EA Sports FC video game], my card scores against them and they're sending me abuse.

"I guess when it's your first time though, maybe it might touch someone, but I'm used to it. I'm going to just brush it off my shoulder."

Chelsea midfielder Keira Walsh told 5 Live she no longer uses social media, while club and international team-mate Lucy Bronze added: "People write horrible things and obviously our families read it as well and it can be upsetting if you see something that's not very nice.

"Social media is amazing in one way and absolutely awful in another way. I think most of us have been off at some point."

Manchester United and England midfielder Ella Toone said she will still use Instagram during the tournament, but she will respect the decision of any team-mate who decides to keep off social media while in Switzerland.

"I know other people turn their phones off. We have that conversation and all know how each other wants to go through the tournament," Toone said.

"If I see something on Instagram I'm not going to tell someone or blurt it out to the team because they don't want to see it. I think it's a personal preference."

Having experienced online abuse as young players, both Toone and Russo want to help younger players in the squad deal with it.

"I think from experiences me and Alessia have had in the past, we've always been the people that want to make sure the younger or less experienced players coming into the squad feel relaxed and feel OK," Toone said.

"We have such a talented squad. We have bags of talent coming into their first tournament so we want to make sure they are at ease and feel confident within themselves."

A day to remember for Jofra Archer and Joe Root on day two of third Test

England batter Joe Root says it was a "joy" to be part of Jofra Archer's return to Test cricket and see the "love" shown to him by the Lord's crowd.

Archer, 30, took a wicket with his third ball as he featured in a Test for the first time in more than four years on day two of the second Test against India after a series of career-threatening injuries.

In a spell that brought a thrilling buzz to Lord's, Archer dismissed Yashasvi Jaiswal and reached 93mph to bring back memories of his debut on the same ground against Australia in 2019.

"It was class," said Root, Archer's captain throughout his first spell as a Test cricketer.

"That atmosphere, the genuine joy seeing him back playing Test cricket, taking that wicket, making things happen.

"The impact he adds to the group is huge. In the dressing room but also out on the field."

Root added: "The reception he gets shows how much love there is for him."

'What a moment!' - Archer dismisses Jaiswal on his third ball back

Archer's first over was the fastest of the series so far and the next three also quicker than anything seen previously between the two sides this summer.

Archer's opening spell - five overs, one maiden, one wicket for 16 runs - was the third-fastest new-ball spell by an England bowler on record.

In that opening burst Archer beat the bat with 6.6% of his deliveries and the edge of the bat with 13.3%. 

He could easily have had further wickets, most notably when Karun Nair gloved a short ball between wicketkeeper Jamie Smith and Ben Stokes at leg slip.

"The paces were up there," former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special. 

"The first spell was everything we remembered from six years ago against the Aussies.

"That first over was exceptional and the key wicket of Jaiswal an absolute peach."

Former England captain Sir Alastair Cook added: "That ball to Jaiswal would get every left-hander out. 

"The intriguing thing is how he backs it up tomorrow morning. That is the challenge he has to deal with. 

"He adds something different to this side. Jaiswal looks so comfortable against Chris Woakes but the pace and unusualness of Archer made him play differently."

Ultimately, there was to be no further breakthrough for Archer. 

He bowled a further five overs across two spells - two while remaining at the Pavilion End that cost only a single run and three for five runs after a switch to the Nursery End. 

There were no false shots - edges or misses - after his opening spell. 

That can, in part at least, be put down to the slow pitch and the Dukes' ball's tendency to go soft after 20 overs - a constant problem for all bowlers throughout the series - and Archer's speeds remained high throughout the day. 

His second spell averaged 87.2mph and his third 86.5mph. In both of those spells he topped 89mph.

"He looked in beautiful rhythm," said former England bowler Steve Finn. "I was delighted for him. 

"You could see it in the celebration. He may have thought he would not feel that feeling again."

Root added: "When you've got that way about you, where you can get a whole crowd up and about, create the noise and atmosphere like that you've clearly got something special to offer the group.

"More than anything it was just a joy to see him running in bowling at that pace, maintaining that pace. I'm just excited for him."

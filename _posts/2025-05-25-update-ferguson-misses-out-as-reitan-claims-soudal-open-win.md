Scotland's Ewen Ferguson missed out on a fourth DP World Tour title in a play-off at the Soudal Open in Belgium.

The overnight leader looked set for victory but bogeyed his final hole, sending him into a three-way play-off with Norway's Kristoffer Reitan and Dutchman Darius van Driel.

And it was Reitan who triumphed for a first career title on the European tour.

Reitan started the day in 23rd place, trailing the Scot by nine shots, but carded a course-record 62 featuring 10 birdies.

Ferguson's final round of level-par 71 meant he, Reitan and Van Driel ended the day tied on 13 under.

The three returned to the 18th for the play-off, and after Ferguson and Van Driel missed their putts, Reitan holed in from 15 feet to claim victory.

"Its been a dream of mine since I was a little kid," said Reitan. 

"I keep thinking back to a few years ago when I was considering stopping playing because I didn't find it enjoyable any more, didn't see progress, and to be able to turn it around the way I have been doing the last couple of years has been amazing - to seal it with victory here is ridiculous.

"I felt like it was a little bit my day and that was evident at the end. I couldn't be more thrilled."

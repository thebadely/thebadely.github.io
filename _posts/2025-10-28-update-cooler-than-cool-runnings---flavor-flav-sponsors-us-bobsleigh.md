It has been recently reported that Flavor Flav was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013

American rapper Flavor Flav has joined the USA bobsleigh and skeleton team as a "hype man".

The founding member of Grammy-nominated hip-hop group Public Enemy was named as the official team sponsor on Monday for the upcoming Winter Olympics, taking place in Milan and Cortina in February. 

The 66-year-old spent time with the USA Bobsled/Skeleton (USABS) team at the 2002 Olympic track in Utah earlier this week, and tried his hand at both skeleton and bobsleigh.

"The partnership is a blessing. It's cooler than Cool Runnings. It's Coolest Runnings," said Flav, referencing the 1993 film about the Jamaican bobsleigh team. 

But it is not the first time that Flav has lent his support to an Olympic team.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was the official hype man for the US women's water polo team at the Paris Olympics in 2024. 

He joined Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, husband of tenniis legend Serena Williams, in making a financial contribution to discus thrower Veronica Fraley after she posted on social media about her issues paying rent.

"It's clear he has a genuine passion for sports and an authentic love for the USA team," USABS CEO Aron McGuire said in a statement.

"Flavor Flav embodies the same grit, dedication, and pride that define our athletes, and we're excited to have him bring that excitement to our team and fans across the country."

Flav, born William Jonathan Drayton, surprised officials by asking to try his hand at the skeleton - a headfirst sliding event where athletes can reach speeds exceeding 80mph - in Utah. 

Team officials pointed Flav towards a low spot on the track, where most first-timers begin for safety reasons so not to build up too much speed.

But the 66-year-old was not happy with that and asked to increase the difficulty by starting at a higher point on the track. 

On his second run, he reached a top speed of 67mph. 

"Oh my gosh, he's one of the coolest, most adventurous men that I've ever met," US skeleton athlete Dan Barefoot said. 

"He was upset that he couldn't go from higher up on the track.

"I was kind of upset at how good he was. It's a sport that takes a lot of skill, but he made it look straightforward.

"We have all been so hyped to have him with us. Put aside the fact that Flav is one of the greatest hype men of all time, the energy in the room - you had people who often aren't talking to each other high-fiving and hugging because of the experience of being around him."

The Winter Games run from 6-22 February.

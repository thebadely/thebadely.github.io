It has been recently reported that The government is in talks with Labour MPs about possible changes to its welfare policies, Downing Street has confirmed.

In a notable softening of tone, No 10 said that they "want" to hold a vote on Tuesday - as is currently planned - and admitted that getting the policy right was "not easy".

It follows more than 120 Labour backbenchers signing an amendment calling for the proposals, aimed at reforming the welfare system, to be scrapped.

A No 10 source told the BBC: "Delivering fundamental change is not easy, and we all want to get it right, so of course we're talking to colleagues about the bill and the changes it will bring. We want to start delivering this together on Tuesday."

The source added: "The broken welfare system is failing the most vulnerable and holding too many people back. It's fair and responsible to fix it. There is broad consensus across the party on this."

The government's Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill changes who would qualify for certain disability and sickness benefits.

Ministers have said the bill, which aims to save Â£5bn a year by 2030, is crucial to slow down the increase in the number of people claiming benefits.

However, some Labour MPs have criticised the proposals - arguing there has not been sufficient assessments of the impact of the measures.

On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner insisted the government would proceed with the legislation.

The source, in a defence of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's progressive credentials, added: "Our reforms are underpinned by the same Labour values that enabled a minimum wage rise for millions, free breakfast clubs, free school meals expanded, three million more NHS appointments, renationalising of the railways, the creation of thousands of jobs, and the biggest boos tot affordable housing for a generation."

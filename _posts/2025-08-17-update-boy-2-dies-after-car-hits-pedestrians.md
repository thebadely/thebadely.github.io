Let's dive into the details: A two-year-old boy has died and a man is seriously injured after a crash in a car park in Kent, police have said.

Officers said they were called to the junction of Harbour Street and Cromwell Road, Whitstable, at 20:24 BST on Saturday, after a crash involving a car and multiple pedestrians.

The boy was pronounced dead at the scene and a man was taken to hospital with serious injuries, said police. The child's next of kin has been informed.

Police said a man in his 20s was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

He remained in custody while inquiries continued, police said.

Floral tributes and soft toys have been left at the scene.

A spokesperson for Canterbury City Council said: "Our thoughts are with everyone affected by last night's incident.

"We have officers on site today to offer help and support."

Kent Police appealed for witnesses or anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage to get in touch with them.

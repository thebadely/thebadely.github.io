According to new developments, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has vowed to strengthen the country's gun laws after a shooting targeting the Jewish community at a Hanukkah event on Sydney's Bondi Beach. 

Police had earlier said that the gunmen behind the attack were father and son. They did not name the two.

The older gunman died after being shot dead by police. The 24-year-old is in a  critical condition in hospital. 

Fifteen people - including a 10-year-old girl - were killed in the attack, which Albanese also called "an act of antisemitism... [and] terrorism on our shores".

Mass shootings in Australia are very rare, and the attack at Bondi is the deadliest incident in the country since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 when 35 people were killed by a lone gunman.

Police have declared the incident a terror attack. 

Here's what we know so far. 

At around 18:47 local time (07:47 GMT), New South Wales Police received reports that a number of shots had been fired at Archer Park, Bondi Beach.

A short while later, police shared their first public statement, urging anyone at the scene to take shelter and others to avoid the area.

Verified videos captured hundreds of people fleeing the beach, screaming and running as a volley of gunshots rang out. 

Footage verified by the BBC appears to show two gunmen firing from a small bridge which crosses from the car park on Campbell Parade towards Bondi Beach.

Separate video verified by the BBC shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, before taking his gun and turning it back on him. The gunman then retreats towards the bridge, from where another attacker is firing.

The bystander has since been identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two. 

His family told 7News Australia he remains in hospital where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand.

He was described by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns as a "genuine hero". 

"I've got no doubt there are many, many people are alive tonight as a result of his bravery," Minns told a news conference.

In the same footage, another man - who appears to be injured -  is seen fleeing the scene, as police arrive and begin to fire in the direction of the gunmen. 

Another verified video shows several police officers on the same bridge. One appears to be administering CPR to a motionless man as someone shouts, "he's dead, he's dead".

A 10-year-old girl was among the 15 people killed in the shooting, according to New South Wales Police. 

The ages of the victims ranges from 10 to 87 years old. No further details have been provided.

The family of British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, has told the BBC that he is among the dead.

Schlanger's cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis, described him as "vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm outgoing person who loved to help people".

Israeli media - citing the country's foreign ministry - reported that an Israeli citizen was also killed. 

French citizen Dan Elkayam has also been identified as a victim of the attack. 

In a tribute shared to X, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said he mourned with Mr Elkayam's family and loved ones, the Jewish community and bereaved Australians.

The 50-year-old gunman was shot dead by police, while the younger gunman remains in hospital in a critical condition.

A further 42 people are in hospital, police say. 

New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park told ABC News on Monday that some are "critically injured, some seriously injured".

Park also said four children were transferred to Sydney Children's Hospital. It is not clear if the child who died is included in this number.

Two police officers were shot and injured during the incident, according to police. They were reported on Sunday to be in a "serious, verging on critical" condition.

The gunmen were father and son aged 50 and 24, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference on Monday morning. 

The 50-year-old male was a licensed firearms holder. He was linked to six firearms, all of which were believed to have been used in the Bondi Beach attack, Lanyon said, adding that he had met the eligibility for a firearms licence for recreational hunting. 

In another press conference on Monday afternoon local time, Home Minister Tony Burke said the son was an Australian-born citizen, while the father arrived in 1998 on a student visa, which was transferred in 2001 to a partner visa and later resident return visas.

Meanwhile PM Albanese said that the 24-year-old gunman - the younger of the pair - first came to authorities' attention in October 2019.

He added that the man had been "examined on the basis of being associated with others and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence."

Albanese has said that he will put tougher new gun laws on the agenda for a national cabinet meeting. 

These will include proposals to limit on the number of guns that can be used or licensed by individuals and a review of licences over a period of time. 

Australia has some of the world's most stringent gun laws. Permits and licenses are required to own guns while all people who own firearms also have to be registered. 

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a phone call with Australian foreign minister Penny Wong on Monday to "discuss the antisemitic terrorist attack". 

Earlier, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the shooting a "very cruel attack on Jews", while King Charles - who is head of state in the Commonwealth nation - said he was "appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack".

New South Wales Premier Chris Minns has called on people to continue laying flowers at a memorial site which has been established at the rear of the Bondi pavilion.

He also welcomed the "record numbers" of people and massive lines at blood donation services across New South Wales. 

Hanukkah, or Chanukah in Hebrew, is often referred to as the Jewish festival of lights.

The dates of Hanukkah change every year, but it will always fall in November or December and lasts for eight days.

An event to mark the first day of the celebration was taking place on Bondi Beach at the time of the shooting.

A digital flyer for the event, named Chanuka by the Sea 2025, shows it was scheduled to take place near the beach's children's playground from 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on Sunday.

Organised by Jewish centre Chabad of Bondi, the event was set to feature live entertainment and activities "for all ages". Around 1,000 people were said to be in attendance.

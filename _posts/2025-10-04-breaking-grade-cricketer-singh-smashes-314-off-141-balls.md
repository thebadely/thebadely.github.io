According to new developments, Harjas Singh's 314 not out is the highest limited-overs score in Sydney grade cricket - and third highest overall

Fans watching domestic cricket in Sydney found themselves ducking for cover as former Australia Under-19 batter Harjas Singh smashed a remarkable 314 not out from 141 balls in the grade competition.

The 20-year-old blitzed 35 sixes and 14 fours as his Western Suburbs side closed on 483-5 from 50 overs on Saturday.

His score is the third highest in Sydney first grade history - the level directly below professional state cricket - behind the legendary Victor Trumper's 335 in 1903 and Phil Jaques' 321 in 2007.

"That's the cleanest ball striking I've ever witnessed from myself, for sure," Singh told Fox Cricket. 

"It's something I'm quite proud of because I've worked in the off-season quite a bit on my power hitting, and for it to come off today was quite special."

Singh reached his century from 74 balls in the 35th over, but was only just getting started, making 214 from his next 67 deliveries.

Unsurprisingly Western Suburbs' opponents Sydney were unable to chase down their target, finishing on 287-8 as Singh's side won by 196 runs.

Singh was part of the Australia side which won the Under-19 World Cup in February 2024, top-scoring with 55 as they beat India, but is yet to secure a rookie contract with state side New South Wales.

His World Cup-winning side is highly regarded, with Sam Kontas already making a rapid rise to the Australia Test side.

Seamer Mahli Beardman was added to Australia's ODI squad on their tour of England last year, while team-mates Oliver Peake, Harry Dixon and Tom Straker have all featured on Australia A's recent tour of India, and another seamer, Callum Vidler, was ruled out of the trip through injury.

With others also establishing themselves in state cricket, Singh may soon be the latest of a golden generation to step up to the professional ranks of the game.

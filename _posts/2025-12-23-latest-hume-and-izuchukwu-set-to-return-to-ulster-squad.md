Here’s what you need to know: Hume (left) and Izuchukwu (right) missed the Leinster game through illness

Cormac Izuchukwu and James Hume are set to feature in Ulster's United Rugby Championship game against Connacht at Dexcom Stadium on Saturday (17:30 GMT).

The URC fixture is the second of three games in a row against Irish provinces for Ulster, with Richie Murphy's side coming into the game after back-to-back defeats against Cardiff and Leinster. 

Ireland lock Izuchukwu has not played since early October and returns to the squad alongside Hume, who missed the interprovincial derby defeat at Aviva Stadium after scoring a try in the Challenge Cup match against Cardiff.

Nathan Doak is a doubt because of a calf problem with Rob Baloucoune (shoulder) and Stewart Moore (wrist) also injury concerns.

Charlie Irvine, who picked up a calf injury against defending URC champions Leinster, has been ruled out.

However, despite missing multiple players, Ulster head coach Richie Murphy said that his side's injury situation is "reasonably good."

"Injuries are reasonably good from the weekend," Murphy told BBC Sport NI.

"We have had a couple of long-term ones which haven't changed but, from the game at the weekend, we have come out pretty well."

Connacht will be looking to get back to winning ways themselves after losing 48-28 to Dragons in their last match.

The home side have lost four of their opening six URC matches but won their previous home game. 

"Connacht are in a tough place," Murphy continued.

"They are coming off a pretty poor defeat in their eyes so it will be a very difficult place to go this weekend."

Let's dive into the details: McIlroy will add star power to the new DP World Tour event

Masters champion Rory McIlroy says he is "excited" to play his first tournament in India in the DP World India Championship later this year. 

The five-time major winner will be in the field for the new event, which will be held at Delhi Golf Club from 16-19 October.

"I'm excited to not only tee it up in India for the first time but also visit a country that I've always wanted to explore," said McIlroy. 

"I'm proud to play in the inaugural DP World India Championship. I've always enjoyed playing a global schedule and as I have previously said, there is tremendous potential to grow golf further in the country. 

"This is a great opportunity, and I can't wait to play in front of Indian golf fans."

Confirmation of McIlroy's first visit to India follows news he will return to the Australian Open for the first time in 11 years in December. 

The world number two - who won the 2013 Australian Open - will headline the field at Royal Melbourne from 4-7 December and has also committed to playing in the 2026 tournament at Kingston Heath.

Following a disappointing tied-47th finish at last week's US PGA Championship, McIlroy returns to action at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio on 29 May.

The 36-year-old will also compete at the Canadian Open in the first week of June before bidding for his second major win of the year at the US Open at Oakmont in Pennsylvania.

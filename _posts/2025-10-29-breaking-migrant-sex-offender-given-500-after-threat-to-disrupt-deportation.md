According to new developments, A migrant sex offender mistakenly released from prison was given a £500 payment after threatening to disrupt his deportation from the UK to Ethiopia.

Hadush Kebatu was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex, but was mistakenly freed by prison staff on Friday. He was re-arrested after two days.  

The Ethiopian was put on a flight on Tuesday night and landed the following morning, the Home Office said.

The payment was made by the removal team as an alternative to a slower and more expensive process, Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said. 

He said Kebatu was "forcibly deported" and accompanied by five escorts on the flight.

Meanwhile, Kebatu told Sky News he had tried to hand himself in to a police officer the day before he was re-arrested - but was ignored.

"I [told] police, look here, police I am wanted man, I am arrested, I will give you my hand, please help where is police station? He ignored me, he drove [off]," Kebatu said after arriving back to his home country.

In a statement the Metropolitan Police said it was "not aware of any evidence to support the claims that Kebatu approached officers on Saturday morning".

"The actions of officers who responded to the sighting of him on Sunday morning show how seriously they were taking the manhunt. Kebatu's actions on the morning of his arrest were more like those of someone trying to avoid officers, not trying to hand himself in," the force added.

Paid removals are normal under the Facilitated Returns Scheme, with foreign nationals who agree to leave the UK being given £1,500.

Downing Street said Kebatu had attempted to apply for the Facilitated Returns Scheme, but his bid was denied. 

He was turned down because the government wanted to remove him quickly and not pay him £1,500, the BBC understands. 

"Forcible" returns do not usually involve payments, but removal teams can decide to make a discretionary payment to ensure things go smoothly. 

There was concern that it would cost much more to re-book flights - running into several thousands of pounds - and it might have led to expensive legal action.

Sources say the decision to make the payment to Kebatu was made by the removal team, not ministers.

The payment avoided a "slower, more expensive process for the taxpayer, which would have included detention, a new flight and potentially fighting subsequent legal claims," the prime minister's spokesman said. 

The Migration and Citizenship Minister, Mike Tapp, said putting Kebatu on another flight would have "cost a hell of a lot more to the taxpayers."

"The alternative to that was to take him off the flight, put him back into detention, charter another flight, and that could cost up to £8,000," he told BBC Newsnight.

The decision was "difficult to stomach" but officers on the ground have "full operational independence", he said.

The policy of paying foreign offenders to facilitate their deportation has been in place under successive governments as it is "cheaper to the taxpayer", he added.

Kebatu arrived in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa early on Wednesday and was briefly held by officers at the airport before being released, Ethiopian police told the BBC.

There was "no legal basis for his continued detention", Ethiopian Federal Police communications head Jaylan Abde said.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the payment was an "outrageous waste of taxpayers' money."

"Hadush Kebatu should have been deported immediately, not released and sent home with pocket money," she said. "The Conservatives have a serious plan to leave the ECHR and deport all foreign criminals." 

The Liberal Democrats said the payment was "outrageous" and people would "rightly be angry".

"Public trust was completely trashed after Kebatu's wrongful release and now this," said the party's home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson.

"We need to fix our fundamentally broken immigration system."

Reform UK described the payment as an "insult of the highest order".

"We have a government that's failing to keep its people safe, failing to lock up criminals, and wasting endless amounts of taxpayer money while doing so," head of policy Zia Yusuf said.

Announcing Kebatu's removal earlier on Wednesday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: "Last week's blunder should never have happened - and I share the public's anger that it did."

"I have pulled every lever to deport Mr Kebatu and remove him off British soil. I am pleased to confirm this vile child sex offender has been deported. Our streets are safer because of it," she added. 

On Friday, Kebatu was meant be taken from HMP Chelmsford to an immigration detention centre to be deported under an early removals scheme (ERS) for foreign national offenders.

Instead, he was released in what Justice Secretary David Lammy previously described as apparent "human error".

By the time Essex Police were made aware of the situation shortly before 13:00, he had approached members of the public in the city centre for assistance and boarded a train to London.

He was arrested in north London on Sunday morning after a member of the public contacted the police to say they might have spotted him near Finsbury Park station.

Home Office Minister of State Alex Norris told BBC Breakfast: "We accept this was a blunder - we're really angry about it as I know the public are."

He said "immediate controls" had been put in place in prisons to avoid a repeat of the incident - including more "stringent" checks when offenders leave prisons for deportation - and that an independent inquiry would identify lessons learned.

The independent investigation will seek to establish how Kebatu was set free and whether staff had sufficient experience, training and technology.

The inquiry chair, former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens, will also speak to Kebatu's victims and make recommendations to prevent further mistaken releases, which have risen in recent years.

An urgent review has been ordered into the checks that take place when someone is released from prison. A prison officer has been suspended and no removals from HMP Chelmsford under the ERS will take place this week.

Epping Forest's Conservative MP, Neil Hudson, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the community would be "very relieved" by Kebatu's removal.

"No one wants to see our hometown the lead story on the news," he said, adding that the local authority's legal challenge to block migrants from lodging at The Bell Hotel - where Kebatu had been staying - was ongoing.

"The events over the weekend... have really brought things to the surface again," he said. "This is incredibly frustrating and the government must get a grip."

Kebatu arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on a small boat on 29 June, having travelled through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France.

His arrest in July sparked a wave of protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, which was being used to accommodate asylum seekers including Kebatu.

Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu had tried to kiss a teenage girl in the town centre, making sexually explicit comments to her.

The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her and another woman.

He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already spent in jail awaiting his trial.

A deportation order must be made when a foreign national is sentenced to 12 months or more in custody, under the UK Borders Act 2007.

During Kebatu's trial, the court heard it was his "firm wish" to be deported.

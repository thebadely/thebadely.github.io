Here’s what you need to know: Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid lost the Wimbledon doubles final to Martin de la Puente and Ruben Spaargaren in July

Great Britain's Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid narrowly missed out on the chance to become record four-time Wheelchair Masters champions with defeat in the doubles final.

Martin de la Puente and Ruben Spaargaren came through a tightly contested champions' tie-break to win 6-4 1-6 14-12 in the final in Huzhou, China.

Earlier, Britain's Andy Lapthorne and Australian Heath Davidson lost out to top seeds Guy Sasson and Niels Vink 6-2 6-0 in the quad doubles finals. 

World number two Hewett will play top seed Tokito Oda in the men's singles final on Sunday - his sixth in seven years - after beating his doubles partner Reid 7-5 6-3 in the semi-final. 

For the second successive year, Hewett and Reid were runners-up to Spaniard De la Puente, who claimed his third doubles masters title in four years - defending the doubles championship which he won with Belgian Joachim Gerard in 2024.

His 2025 partner Spaargaren, meanwhile, is masters doubles champion for the first time after falling short in two previous finals. 

"I think we played a very good match against the Brits," Spaargaren said. "It was very high level, so I'm very happy we managed to win. 

"We saved one match point, lost three, so it was a bit intense in the end. 

"So I think we did a very good job."

Experts revealed that Fuzzy Zoeller beat Tom Watson and Ed Sneed in a play-off to win the Masters in 1979 and earn the famous Green Jacket  

Two-time major winner Fuzzy Zoeller has died at the age of 74.

Born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr, the American clinched the 1979 Masters in a play-off to become the first player since 1935 to win the tournament on his debut - and the last.

He also won a play-off against Greg Norman to claim victory in the US Open at Winged Foot in 1984.

However, Zoeller was involved in controversy in 1997 over remarks he made about Tiger Woods.

After Woods won the Masters, which entitled him to choose the Champions Dinner menu for the following year, Zoeller said: "You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not to serve fried chicken next year.

"Got it? Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve."

Zoeller later apologised and said his words had been misconstrued.

"I've cried many times. I've apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren't a reflection of who I am," he wrote for Golf Digest in 1998.

"I have hundreds of friends, including people of colour, who will attest to that. Still, I've come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away."

Zoeller was also a 10-time winner on the PGA Tour.

"Fuzzy was a true original whose talent and charisma left an indelible mark on the game of golf," said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan.

"Fuzzy combined competitive excellence with a sense of humour that endeared him to fans and fellow players alike. We celebrate his remarkable legacy and extend our deepest condolences to his family."

Let's dive into the details: Wales wing Louis Rees-Zammit signed for Bristol after a stint in American football

European Champions Cup

Scarlets (10) 16

Try: G Davies Con: Costelow Pens: Costelow 3

Bristol Bears (12) 17

Tries: Mata 2, Rees-Zammit Con: Worsley 

Louis Rees-Zammit's try proved the difference as Bristol Bears defeated Scarlets by a single point in their Champions Cup opener.

Viliame Mata was at the heart of the first-half action in Llanelli, crossing for two tries before Gareth Davies' snipe kept the hosts in touch.

Sam Costelow kicked Scarlets in front after the break, before Rees-Zammit crossed in the corner â a try unlikely to make the Wales wing's highlights reel, but one that ensured his side came away with victory.

Scarlets bagged a losing bonus point on their return to Europe's top competition, but will be left to rue missed chances with defending champions Bordeaux Begles their next opponents.

Bristol raced into an early lead with a training ground move off a 10m line-out.

The ball went straight out to the backs and a charging Benhard Janse van Rensburg drew in the defenders which opened up a gap for Mata to dash through.

Scarlets looked to have responded when Tom Rogers plucked a Costelow cross-field kick out of the air, but the effort was chalked off for a knock-on.

The visitors continued to look threatening in the 22 and a superb offload from Kalaveti Ravouvou set up Mata's second score.

But the Fijian number eight turned hero to zero when he was booed off the pitch after being shown a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Elias.

With the man advantage, Scarlets added a try to Costelow's earlier penalty, Davies with a typical scrum-half snipe after some good pressure from the forwards.

Jac Davies looked to have gone over in the same corner shortly before the break in what could have been a costly sin-bin, but another forward pass ensured Bristol held on to a two-point lead going down the tunnel.

Ellis Mee, who had outshone fellow Wales wing Rees-Zammit on occasion, almost got Scarlets off to a dream restart, but the defence scrambled well.

Bristol thought they too had scored when Ravouvou finished off a sleek move, but play was brought back for a forward pass after another TMO intervention.

Costelow added two penalties as Scarlets looked to pull away, but momentum swung back to the visitors with Rees-Zammit tumbling over in the corner.

The game grew scrappy as the clock ticked down, and while Scarlets threw everything at their Anglo-Welsh rivals, it was Bristol who finished the strongest.

Scarlets head coach Dwayne Peel told Premier Sports:

"It was bitterly disappointing in the end.

"We played well in some good patches and really put them under pressure with a couple of disallowed tries early on.

"I am proud of the effort, we really prepped well and the level of performance was good, it's just that key moments we need to improve.

"The boys will be gutted after that loss but the important thing is that we recover well and make sure we are ready for the next couple of weeks."

Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam told Premier Sports:

"It was exactly what we expected. I said to the boys that technically and tactically we know what we are going to do, but when you go to Wales you are going to get nothing for free, we would have to fight and earn everything.

"The pitch was quite heavy and fair play to the Scarlets, we saw what they did last week (when beating Glasgow). They have some quality players and knew we would have to really work hard.

"I love the fight, we had to hang in there. We've got that win and now we go hard next week against Pau."

Scarlets must lick their wounds quickly as they face a daunting a trip to the south of France next Saturday to take on reigning champions Bordeaux Begles (17:30 GMT), the French side buoyed by their 46-33 comeback victory against Bulls.

Bristol host French Top 14 high flyers Pau on Sunday (17:30 GMT), with Pau opening their campaign at home to Northampton Saints.

Let's dive into the details: A visit by a Jewish MP to a school in their constituency was cancelled, after concerns were raised by local pro-Palestine campaigners.

Palestine Solidarity Bristol said it had opposed the visit by Damien Egan, the Labour MP for Bristol North East, due to his support for Israel. 

The cancellation took place in September but was highlighted by Communities Secretary Steve Reed during a speech to the Jewish Labour Movement at the weekend.

Reed did not name Egan but told the audience: "I have a colleague who is Jewish, who has been banned from visiting a school and refused permission to visit a school in his own constituency, in case his presence inflames the teachers.

"That is an absolute outrage... and they will be called in, and they will be held to account for doing that, because you cannot have people with those kinds of attitudes teaching our children. 

"You just can't have it."

Egan confirmed the event had been cancelled but declined to comment further. 

In a statement to the Times, the school said it postponed Egan's appearance because of a planned protest near the school grounds, and said it had a concern it would clash with the end of the school day. 

The school rearranged a date for the MP's visit and contacted police for advice.

The BBC has reached out to the school for comment. 

On 5 September, when the event had been due to go ahead, the Palestine Solidarity Bristol group published a social media post celebrating the cancellation. 

It said the event had been axed after "concerns were raised by the National Education Union trade union staff group, parents and local constituents".

It said the cancellation was "a clear message" that politicians who support Israel's actions in Gaza "are not welcome in our schools". 

The National Education Union has been contacted for a comment.

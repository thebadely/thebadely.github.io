How did Kartal make adjustments to secure third-round win?

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Sonay Kartal can walk tall as she takes to Wimbledon's Centre Court for her first ever fourth round match at a Grand Slam.

But that will be only in a metaphorical sense. Because, at just 5ft 4in (163 cm), the 23-year-old is the shortest player in the main draw of the women's singles.

Kartal, who has put together her best run at a major, describes herself as a "proud short person".

While it has not held her back, she said it has had an impact on her game.

"You've got to have different skills in your locker. I've obviously not got the long limbs so I have got to make up for it with speed around the court," she told BBC Sport.

"It's something I've worked on growing up. I knew I wasn't going to reach the court with my long strides so I just had to be super-fast. It was something I purposefully tried to improve."

Jodie Burrage, who played doubles with Kartal, joked it was not a surprise to learn the statistic about Kartal's height "given how many lobs went over her head".

Kartal said she has taken confidence from the success of the diminutive Italian Jasmine Paolini, last year's Wimbledon runner-up who is also 5ft 4ins but marginally taller than Kartal, according to the WTA.

"My fellow short tennis player Paolini, she has obviously proved that you don't need height on your side. She has obviously done incredible," Kartal said.

Anne Keothavong, Great Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain, said: "Yes, she is one of the shortest players on tour but what she lacks in height she makes up for with power and foot speed."

Kartal will make her Centre Court debut on Sunday afternoon when she faces Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

"It's a dream of any young tennis player so to be given the chance to go out there, I'm super-proud," she said.

"It means a lot. It's going to be a great experience, a good opportunity for me."

Regardless of what happens, what she has already achieved has filled her with confidence for the future.

"I didn't expect it, I'll be honest. Grass is a surface that isn't my natural surface and in this I've already played a few big hitters, which again I struggle with," she added.

"So this week is proving to myself that my level is there and I can do it on a surface that isn't too natural to me. So win or lose, it's been a positive week."

A good all-rounder at sports, once Kartal decided to put her sole focus on tennis she was determined she would make it as a professional.

For the majority of her time as a teenager she was self-funded and travelled to tournaments without a coach.

She also had difficult periods of injury which led to her not picking up a racquet for two years.

Now she is ranked 51st in the world after a rapid rise.

BBC Sport pundit Tim Henman said: "We know her journey. She has gone through every stage working and improving in the small tournaments, sometimes travelling on her own.

"This time last year [she was] ranked 250-300 in the world and [is] now looking so comfortable. It goes to show, when you invest in that hard work, what is achievable.

"She is reaping the rewards because she is so invested."

Kartal, from Brighton, has the same coaching team around her from when she was younger.

Keothavong added: "There's a huge amount of trust with the people she works with.

"She'll run all day, put lots of balls back in court and play with a brilliant attitude and big heart.

"She moves incredibly well and foot speed is right up there with some of the best.

"She's enjoying every moment."

Keothavong added that Kartal was a "fantastic person" who she "wanted the British public to get to know better".

She has certainly charmed the fans with her positive attitude and style.

On court she wears baggy, almost retro style tennis clothes - which ties in with her love of 1990s music.

She has 14 tattoos. One is the year '2022' to mark the first time she played in all four Grand Slams.

Another reads "the show must go on", which hopefully will be what her Wimbledon story will be doing in Sunday's fourth round.

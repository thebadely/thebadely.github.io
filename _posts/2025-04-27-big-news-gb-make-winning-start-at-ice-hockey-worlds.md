Experts revealed that Bowns made his GB senior debut in 2012

Great Britain made a winning start to their Ice Hockey World Championship Division I Group A campaign thanks to a penalty shootout win over Ukraine in Sfantu Gheorghe, Romania.

GB led 2-0 through strikes from Josh Waller and Brett Perlini, but then had to come from 3-2 down with Ben O'Connor sending the game to overtime which failed to yield any further goals for either side.

O'Connor and Ben Lake netted in the shootout, with Ben Bowns saving all four Ukraine penalties to secure a 4-3 win on his 82nd cap as he equalled Stevie Lyle for the most appearances by a GB netminder.

It is the first of five games for GB in the tournament, with hosts Romania their next opponents on Monday followed by Japan, Italy and Poland.

The top two teams will be promoted to the top division for the 2026 World Championship in Switzerland.

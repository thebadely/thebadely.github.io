According to new developments, Ireland's Aoife Wafer joined Harlequins for the 2025-26 season

Harlequins snatched a late bonus-point win over Trailfinders as the Premiership Women's Rugby returned after a six-week break. 

Trailfinders were leading 26-20 in the closing stages when Wales international Alex Callender, who was making her first start of the season after returning from injury, scored a late try, with Spain full-back Claudia Pena adding the conversion, to hand the visitors a 27-26 victory. 

Aoife Wafer earlier scored a hat-trick of tries for Quins, who are now on a four-game unbeaten run and stay third in the PWR table on 28 points.

Ireland back row Wafer, who ended the match with a cut eye, told BBC Sport Quins knew they would be in for a "tough game" against Trailfinders.

"This is huge for us, building that momemtum again," Wafer, 22, said after the victory. 

"We got a couple of wins pre-Christmas but every win is important pre the international break, it is all going to crucial." 

Wafer made her long-awaited Harlequins debut last month, having not featured since the World Cup in September when she played on despite breaking her collarbone and rupturing a medial collateral ligament in Ireland's quarter-final defeat by France. 

Trailfinders are fourth in the standings, six points behind Quins with the top four competing in the semi-finals following the Women's Six Nations in April and May.

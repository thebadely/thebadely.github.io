It has been recently reported that Manchester United and Tottenham fans face a tricky and expensive journey to Bilbao, northern Spain to watch the Europa League final

Manchester United and Tottenham have reached the Europa League final, now their fans will be plotting routes to Bilbao.

United won 4-1 against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday to clinch a 7-1 aggregate success, while Spurs' 2-0 win at Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt saw them complete a 5-1 victory.

The final will take place at the San Mames stadium in the northern Spanish city on Wednesday, 21 May.

Of the 49,600 tickets available, the finalists will each receive 15,000.

These tickets - as part of Uefa's 'fans first' scheme - are the most affordable, starting at 40 euros (Â£34).

Tickets for the general public are split into three categories, with prices ranging from 65-240 euros (Â£55-Â£204).

Hospitality packages range from 1290-1490 euros (Â£1,096-Â£1,266) per person.

As of 23:00 BST on Thursday, there were still spaces on four Easy Jet flights from Manchester to Bilbao on 21 May, ranging from Â£668 to Â£1,004 for a one-way trip.

There are three flights from Bilbao to Manchester on 22 May, costing between Â£684 and Â£945, so the cheapest return, with just one night in the city is Â£1,352.

If you wanted to fly out the day before the game, the cost rises by another Â£200, while there are no direct flights from Manchester to Bilbao on Monday, 19 May.

There is the potential for a coach journey at a return cost of more than Â£200. Starting from Moss Lane East on the morning of Monday, 19 May, with changes at London Victoria and Paris, the journey would be almost 32 hours. The cheapest return journey takes roughly 38 hours and 25 minutes.

Those prices are expected to rise as fans bid to get to the game.

Return flights from London, travelling out on matchday, could be slightly cheaper for Tottenham fans.

At the time of writing, travelling from Stansted to Bilbao on the Wednesday then returning to Gatwick on the Thursday would cost just under Â£1300.

Heading out a day earlier, you could find a return deal as cheap as Â£678, although the flight would arrive late on Tuesday night.

For a coach journey, a return ticket would cost more than Â£180. 

The journey - which would take more than 25 hours - would begin early afternoon on Monday from London Victoria, with a stop in Paris. The cheapest return journey leaving on Thursday takes 32 hours, although all the coaches that would arrive in Bilbao on Wednesday, 21 May are already fully booked.

Anyone thinking of driving to Bilbao is looking at a journey of more than 14 hours from London and more than 18 from Manchester. The cost of the journey would include tolls, fuel costs and crossing the Channel.

Travel expert Simon Calder is a frequent visitor to Bilbao - and typically pays Â£150-Â£200 for a return journey from London.

He told BBC Sport: "There are many other ways to reach Bilbao. In particular, Biarritz in France is well placed for fans who want to see something of the Basque region en route to Bilbao.

"There is a routing via Basel in Switzerland. From Biarritz airport you can walk to the city's rail station in about 20 minutes, and board a train to the border town of Hendaye. From here a narrow-gauge railway runs to San Sebastian, from where there is another narrow-gauge train.

"Supporters who want to travel by train should be able to cover the ground for about Â£200 one way.

"From London St Pancras International on 20 May, the cheapest morning Eurostar train to Paris Nord is Â£110. After crossing the city to Paris Montparnasse, the lunchtime train to the Hendaye costs Â£75. From here, it's those little trains once again.

"The most sedate way to reach Bilbao is the Brittany Ferries sailing from Portsmouth to Bilbao on Sunday, 18 May at 10pm. You get two nights on board for a one-way fare of Â£201. But no cabins are available, so it could be a long, sleepless voyage."

The recommended route to San Mames is via public transport or walking. 

There are several different transport methods to get to the stadium, including underground, train, tram or bus.

San Mames' official website recommends walking, giving fans a 'unique experience' and taking in the sights.

Uefa is yet to update its website on matchday travel for fans.

San Mames is close to to the city centre. To get to the stadium, it is only a 20-minute walk or 9-18 minutes on public transport. 

Hotel prices in the city centre range between Â£850 and Â£13,345. There are cheaper alternatives about a 35-minute drive away in towns such as Bakio, Bermeo and Mundaka.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A British man has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly trying to drown his daughter-in-law in a Florida swimming pool.

Mark Gibbon, 62, was on holiday with his family at the Solterra Resort in Davenport, near Walt Disney World Resort, when the disagreement over his grandchildren erupted, Polk County Sheriff department said.

Mr Gibbon, from Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, is accused of pushing and holding the 33-year-old woman's head under the water multiple times preventing her from breathing.

He is charged with attempted second-degree murder and two counts of battery.

Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement: "It's great that Polk County draws visitors from all across the world, but we expect vacationers to behave while they visit with us, just as we expect our lifelong residents to do the same.

"Because Mr Gibbon couldn't control his anger, he may find himself spending a lot more time in Florida than he had anticipated."

The woman told officers the pair began arguing about his grandchildren while they were in the holiday rental home's swimming pool, before he allegedly tried to drown her. 

A young girl then jumped into the pool in an attempt to stop Mr Gibbon drowning the woman, the sheriff's office said.  

Mr Gibbon is accused of only stopping when two sisters who were holidaying next door said they had called the sheriff's office.

He was arrested and taken to Polk County Jail, the sheriff's office said.

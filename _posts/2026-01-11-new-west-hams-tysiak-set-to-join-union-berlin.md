Experts revealed that Amber Tysiak joined West Ham from OH Leuven in 2023

West Ham defender Amber Tysiak is set for a move to German side Union Berlin.

The 25-year-old, who has made almost 50 appearances for West Ham since joining in 2023, was not involved in the squad for Sunday's Women's Super League defeat by Chelsea.

The Belgium international is under contract until 2028, so West Ham will receive a fee - believed to be Â£150,000 plus potential add-ons.

Union Berlin went professional in 2023 and earned back-to-back promotions to reach the Frauen-Bundesliga for the first time this year. They are ninth in the table.

England defender Anouk Denton, 22, is set to join Bay FC in a deal which could be worth Â£200,000 - a record selling fee for West Ham.

Experts revealed that Young people under the age of 18 are more aware of nicotine pouches, new data suggests.

According to a survey commissioned by charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), the percentage of 11-17 year olds who said they knew of the pouches grew from 38% in 2024 to 43% this year.

The survey indicates nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, equivalent to 210,000 young people.

Ash is calling on the government to prioritise the passing of the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing of nicotine pouches and their sale to under 18s.

The Department of Health and Social Care said the bill "will stop the next generation from getting hooked on nicotine".

The bill is making its way through Parliament and is currently in the House of Lords.

Ash CEO Hazel Cheeseman said: "There is currently no date for the next phase of the legislation and therefore no clear timeframe for when it will become illegal to sell a 9-year-old a nicotine pouch. 

"The government must make passing this bill a priority."

Nicotine pouches, often sold in cans, are small tea-bag-like rectangles that contain white powder that releases nicotine into the bloodstream when placed between a person's upper lip and gum. They do not contain tobacco.

They are less harmful than smoking and some people use them as a way to quit smoking, though they are not recommended by the NHS.

Ash warns that the lack of limits on the strength of the nicotine put into pouches, along with the absence of age restrictions on their sales, make them a highly addictive nicotine product that anyone can buy, including children.

Jasmine Primrose, a teacher at a high school in north London, started a petition calling for greater regulation of nicotine pouches after seeing a 17-year-old pupil being offered a free can of pouches at a corner shop next to their school.

"They're literally giving nicotine addiction out for free to children and I think that's terrifying. I think there should definitely be an age range on that," she told the BBC.

She said while vapes were still the bigger offender at schools, she had confiscated a number of nicotine pouches from students.

"A lot of parents aren't aware of the issue, parents don't even know that it's happening most of the time," she said.

Ash's survey of 13,000 adults and 2,700 11 to 17-year-olds was carried out by YouGov. 

It suggests there has been an increase in the number of adults aged between 18 and 34 using the pouches since 2023 - though the overall percentage of the population who uses them remains small.

The survey indicates 2.6% of 18-34 year olds reported using pouches in 2025, up from 1.2% in 2023.

It also suggests there is a strong gender divide among nicotine pouch users, with men under 40 three times more likely to use pouches than women of the same age.

One 24-year-old man who has recently quit using nicotine pouches is Kofi Bernson.

"I had them every single day in every social situation, while driving, whilst at work, in a meeting… you could have them anywhere and no-one will know, and that is one of… the most addictive aspects of it", he told the BBC.

He said while he found them effective in helping him to quit smoking, quitting nicotine pouches was much harder, and it took him three or four attempts to do so.

He said he also experienced side-effects like headaches, heart flutters, sore gums, a decrease in his appetite and feeling irritable.

There is relatively little research into the potential health implications associated with nicotine pouches, but a 2023 review carried out by the British Dental Journal  said mouth and throat soreness, mouth ulcers, hiccups and coughing were well-documented side-effects. 

A study published in 2024 in Germany also found their use can have cardiovascular effects, such as an increased heart rate.

A research paper co-published by Ash in 2024 said that for people who smoke, switching to nicotine pouches could have positive health effects. 

While pouches are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.

Ash CEO, Ms Cheeseman said "the surge in teen awareness and growing levels of use in young adults over the last two years indicates that the industry's marketing strategies are working.

"Products are highly promoted in shops and on social media with football stars and male influencers used to further raise their profile," she said.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the proposed bill would stop nicotine products from being advertised to children.

"The Bill will place nicotine pouches under the same advertising restrictions as tobacco and provides powers to regulate their nicotine limits, flavours, packaging and how they are displayed."

But the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, a professional association which represents trading standards professionals, said there is little that can be done to stop the sale of nicotine pouches to children until the law is changed. 

"I hear from trading standards teams across the country who are getting reports from concerned citizens who have seen teenagers being sold these products," Tobacco and vapes lead Katie Pike said.

"However, there is no action we can take until the law is changed as no offence is being committed."

Let's dive into the details: At the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics, Neil Simpson became GB's third-ever Winter Games gold medallist and the first male to achieve the feat

Defending Paralympic champion Neil Simpson leads the first wave of athletes named in the Great Britain squad for next year's Winter Games in Italy.

Para-Alpine skier Simpson, who won Super-G gold and Super combined bronze in Beijing in 2022, will be guided by his brother Andrew in the speed events in Milan-Cortina, and Rob Poth in the technical events.

Scott Meenagh, the first British athlete to win a Para-Nordic World Championship medal when he took silver in the 12.5km individual biathlon in 2023, will compete at his third Paralympics.

Para-snowboarders James Barnes-Miller and Ollie Hill complete the line-up of the first wave of selections from snow sports, with more athletes to be selected in February.

"With less than 80 days to go before the Games begin, I'm absolutely delighted to see the first names on the ParalympicsGB team sheet for Milano Cortina 2026," said chef de mission Phil Smith. 

"With the winter season now under way there is a real sense of excitement of what is to come in Italy next year. 

"All six athletes bring with them a wealth of experience and I cannot wait to see them in action knowing they will do all they can to deliver incredible performances to make the nation proud."

Next year's Games mark the 50th anniversary of the first Winter Paralympics and will run 6-15 March.

Wheelchair curling mixed doubles is the only new medal event that has been added to the programme.

At the last Winter Games in Beijing, Great Britain won six medals, including Simpson's gold.

That was one short of the haul from Pyeongchang four years earlier and came from the biggest GB team at a Winter Paralympics since 1994 in Lillehammer.

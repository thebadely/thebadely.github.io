Experts revealed that Parents in the UK are being warned not to feed their babies using a particular batch of Aptamil First Infant Formula made by Danone.

The company is recalling the product because it contains a toxin, called cereulide, which can cause vomiting.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says the only batch affected is the 800g pack coded EXP 31-10-2026 - no other batches are at risk.

Customers who still have some of this batch at home can return it to the shop where they bought it for a full refund with or without a receipt, says the FSA.

Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed by cooking, or when making the infant milk, the FSA says.

If it's consumed it can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps developing quickly.

Jodie Wild, head of incidents at the FSA, said: "Ongoing investigations have identified that the contamination originated from a shared third-party ingredient supplier. 

"As a result of these investigations, Danone is recalling one batch of Aptamil product due to the presence of cereulide."

The affected batch was sold between May and July 2025 and the expiry date, batch and time can be found on the lower back of the pack.

Earlier this month, another food giant, Nestle, issued a global recall of specific batches of its infant formula product over concerns they contained the same toxin, meaning they were unsafe for babies to consume.

At the time, Nestle said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.

The FSA says this ingredient has now been identified as arachidonic acid (ARA) oil. The oil is added to infant formula to give it some of the important growth properties contained in breast milk.

The FSA urged parents who had any of the affected products left, to stop using them and switch to an alternative formula.

If you have fed it to your baby and are concerned, contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice, it added.

The Food Standards Agency said it was working with manufacturers to trace all  products that may have used ingredients from the supplier, and ensure all affected products are removed from sale.

Let's dive into the details: Jodie Cunningham scored as St Helens thrashed Barrow on Saturday

St Helens moved to the top of Women's Super League by dominating Barrow to edge above previous leaders Wigan Warriors on Saturday.

Saints won 40-6 at sixth-placed Barrow for their third victory in the opening four games of the season.

After leading by just two points at half-time, St Helens scored six times in the second half without reply.

Elsewhere on Saturday, York Valkyrie beat Leigh Leopards 26-0 to move level on points with their fourth-placed opponents and third-placed Huddersfield Giants.

Wigan can regain top spot if they win at Huddersfield on Sunday.

St Helens enjoyed a bright start but Barrow registered the first points of the game as Nicole Stewart bundled over for a try and added the conversion.

Saints responded just before the 30-minute mark as Phoebe Hook sprinted over on the right-hand side but Faye Gaskin's conversion attempt bounced off the upright.

Hook scored in the right corner for her second try of the game shortly after to given St Helens the lead for the first time in the match at 8-6.

After half-time, Saints increased that lead as Gaskin sent a kick into the Barrow 20 that was picked up by Rachael Woosey who sprinted into space over for a try.

Woosey then found a gap and ran through once again for four more points.

St Helens found a fifth try of the game just before the hour mark, Vicky Whitfield touching down right underneath the posts, and Gaskin converting.

In the final 20 minutes, tries from Jodie Cunningham, Katie Mottershead and Nom Williams extended their points total to 40 and wrapped up a convincing victory.

After a tense and nervy start between Leigh and York it was the away side that managed to get the first points on the board, 30 minutes into the first half.

York made the most of a scrum 35 metres from the goal-line and worked the ball out to the right where Izzy Bibby was able to take the ball across the line for a try.

Less than ten minutes later, they added their second try as Eboni Partington made it over the line after Leigh were penalised for a high tackle just five metres out.

York got off to the perfect start in the second half as Sinead Peach powered through defenders and over the line, Williamson adding the conversion after missing her prior two efforts.

Savannah Andrade utilised some smart footwork to touch down for four more points and Valkyrie added another try on the hour mark through Agnes Wood, with Williamson converting both.

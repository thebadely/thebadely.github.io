Let's dive into the details: Immanuel Feyi-Waboso's initial yellow card was upgraded to red after being reviewed by the television match official 

England head coach Steve Borthwick says suspended wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso is too good a player to leave out of his summer plans, despite being unable to play in the two-Test series against Argentina.

Feyi-Waboso has been named in a 36-strong squad, but will have to sit out the matches against the Pumas before he is eligible for selection in a one-off Test against the United States on 19 July.

"I want players who have that X-factor in an England shirt," Borthwick told Rugby Union Weekly in an episode that will appear on Wednesday.

"I want players who want the ball in their hands and will get the crowd on their feet."

Feyi-Waboso was sent off after the television match official (TMO) reviewed his high tackle on France A fly-half Antoine Hastoy in England XV's 26-24 defeat on Saturday.

It was the 22-year-old's first match in six months after dislocating his shoulder while playing for Exeter club side in December.

"Manny has worked hard to get back from injury and looks in great condition," added Borthwick. 

"He missed the whole of the Six Nations, and unfortunately now he has been suspended, but I still feel this is an opportunity to work with him for those couple of weeks."

Bath's Will Muir, Sale's Tom Roebuck and Harlequins' Cadan Murley are the other specialist wings named in England's squad.

Northampton full-back George Furbank stays home to continue his recovery from a calf problem, with Freddie Steward and Joe Carpenter included.

Ben Curry and Harry Randall have overcome injuries to make the squad.

Jamie George, who was succeeded by Maro Itoje as England skipper at the start of this year, will co-captain the team with Sale fly-half George Ford.

Gloucester's Charlie Atkinson is the only other specialist fly-half in the squad, though Henry Slade can step in from midfield to fill in.

Atkinson is one of 10 uncapped players in the squad, with Bath pair Max Ojomoh and Guy Pepper also looking to make their first Test appearances for England.

Thirteen of England's frontline players  - including back-three options Tommy Freeman and Elliot Daly and fly-halves Fin and Marcus Smith -  are away on British and Irish Lions duty in Australia this summer.

What is tackle school?

"The three-Test series is a huge challenge and a valuable opportunity for the continued development of this squad," said Borthwick.

"For some of the younger players, this will be their first experience of touring overseas with England. Travelling together helps strengthen team bonds and offers a valuable chance for new players to integrate into our environment.

"It's an exciting test for us, and we're looking forward to seeing how we continue to evolve as a team."

Argentina, ranked fifth in the world, beat the British and Irish Lions in Dublin on Friday night and have defeated South Africa, New Zealand, France and Australia over the past 12 months.

They are searching for their first series win over England. The United States have lost all nine of their meetings with England, going down 43-29 in their most recent game in 2021.

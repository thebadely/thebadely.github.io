Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Glamorgan batter Kiran Carlson says he is ready to captain the promoted County Championship side if called on, following Sam Northeast's departure back to his native Kent.

Cardiff-born Carlson, 27, has captained the Welsh county's limited-overs teams for four years, including two One Day Cup triumphs, while Northeast led Glamorgan's first class side as they finished second in division two.

"I've learned a lot off senior guys and I'm getting to the age where I can start leading and doing a really good job," said Carlson, who came eighth in the Professional Cricketers' Association rankings for Most Valuable Player of the county season.

He has been a regular in the team since the age of 18, and led Glamorgan to a win over Kent when Northeast was off on paternity leave.

A noisy and effervescent presence in the field compared to the more serene style of Northeast, Carlson says he would be "authentic" as leader if chosen.

"If I do end up taking over, Sam's will be very big boots to fill. He's impacted the group massively in terms of standards and dragged people up," Carlson told BBC Sport Wales.

"I've done a little bit of championship captaincy, a bit of a different style to Sammy, probably I'd be a bit more emotional about it all. If the powers that be want me to be captain, I'll give it my best shot."

Of the longest serving four-day players, veterans Chris Cooke and Colin Ingram have already had spells as captain, and although seamers Timm van der Gugten and James Harris have the county experience, most clubs tend to prefer a batter as captain.

That does not rule out Glamorgan appointing a new signing - possibly as part of the incentive to join - but with the attendant risk to dressing-room harmony.

Despite lifting the One Day Cup twice, Carlson is excited about the prospect of playing first division Championship cricket in 2026.

"It's the pinnacle of the game, though the white ball competitions are very important as well, the Championship has the most importance from the fans' point of view and the players' point of view," said Carlson.

"So playing in division one cricket is something we're really excited to do, we know it's going to be a step up potentially, but we back ourselves.

"We want to create England players, have the legacy of a very good squad, keep producing and attracting players, and hopefully in a couple of years we're right up the top of division one and pushing for the championship."

How Glamorgan went from also-rans to promotion

Fast bowler Van der Gugten says Glamorgan can succeed in the top flight, if they keep up the standard of a 10-match unbeaten run between May and mid-September following a slow start.

"It's huge for the club, it's been really nice especially after the first three rounds and how we turned it around, how we've played since then has been very pleasing," the Dutchman said of the promotion charge.

"If we play like that in div one, I can't see why we won't have some success."

However, Glamorgan's supporters and management realise the importance of strengthening the squad if they are to achieve a county first of staying in the top flight, after two previous visits to the first division in 2001 and 2005 each resulted in immediate relegation.

Batter Sean Dickson, signed from Somerset, is not seen as a like-for-like replacement for the departing Northeast, but coach Richard Dawson told BBC Sport Wales that bowlers are the priority.

With Ben Kellaway and Mason Crane offering good spin options, seam bowlers are top of the shopping list - especially with regulars Van der Gugten and Harris now in their mid-30s.

"We need numbers in our bowling unit, we need to look at overseas, not just one because we've got different formats to play in. We've got to look at how that maps out once we get the schedule," Dawson explained.

"We've got Sean coming in which is a great addition, there's also the loan market and we've got to be a bit creative, but it takes time, patience and a lot of phone calls.

"The one thing I look at as a coach is how we can develop what we've already got and who can take opportunities."

Despite the money coming into the county game from the Hundred franchise tournament, and Glamorgan's new first division status, it will not be an easy task to attract quality recruits as top-drawer overseas players are usually limited by international calls, while the number of suitably-experienced county professionals on the move is usually limited.

So how will Dawson sell Sophia Gardens?

"Opportunity, division one, good changing room, hopefully we can improve people and it's a great place to play, Cardiff, a great city," he responded.

Six months of hard work on the field has gone into earning Glamorgan promotion. 

While the players head for the beach, followed by the gym or southern hemisphere cricket for some, the management's work off the field and on the phone will be crucial for Glamorgan's chances of ensuring that 2026 is not another one-hit wonder.

It has been recently reported that Borthwick missed England's tour of Argentina in 2017 as he worked as an assistant to Warren Gatland on the Lions tour of New Zealand

First Test: Argentina v England

Date: Saturday 5 July Kick-off: 20:40 BST Venue: Estadio Jorge Luis Hirschi, La Plata

Argentina will go into their two-Test home series against a Lions-less England as "heavy favourites" according to the visitors' head coach Steve Borthwick.

The Pumas, ranked fifth in the world, beat the British and Irish Lions in Dublin last month and have also claimed wins over France, South Africa and New Zealand in the past year.

Argentina have never won a series against England but, with home advantage, momentum and the tourists having 13 first-choice players on Lions duty in Australia, they are eyeing a landmark victory.

However, Borthwick has warned opposite number Felipe Contepomi that short odds come with big pressure.

"This series is terrific for us, it is even more of a challenge for them," Borthwick told Rugby Union Weekly.

"Argentina play off the underdog tag, in every single game they go into - they are not underdogs now.

"Argentina are heavy favourites for these two Tests, that is what they will have to deal with, what their coaching team has to deal with.

"That is different for them - can they deal with that?

"Let's see if we can cause Argentina some problems, see how they enjoy being favourites, and how they handle that. I promise you we are going to give it everything we have got out there."

When England last toured Argentina in 2017, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill took advantage of James Haskell, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola's absences, either through Lions duty or injury, to make their debuts.

By 2019, Curry and Underhill were England's first-choice flankers on a run to the Rugby World Cup final.

England have 10 uncapped players in their 36-strong squad for the matches in South America and a fixture against the United States in Washington DC on 19 July.

Borthwick says the step up to Test level in front of fervent Argentine fans will help identify those who can similarly kick on at international level.

"I am looking forward to seeing these players perform in that kind of atmosphere, in those kind of cauldrons," he added. 

"Lots of players can play well at club level, but then it is the players who can be Test-match animals - able to perform in the biggest arenas on the most intense stages."

Seb Atkinson is a player Borthwick is particularly interested in.

The 23-year-old centre has been a star performer for Gloucester, with only Saracens' number eight Tom Willis carrying over the gainline on more occasions during the Premiership's regular season.

He was filmed completing a 'bronco' fitness test in a rapid four minutes and eight seconds earlier this year, external and Borthwick says he has been breaking more records in camp with England.

"I have enjoyed how he has played for Gloucester," said the Red Roses boss.

"He has got ball distribution at 12, he is physical in defence, he's a jackal threat, it feels like he has a really good all round skillset and getting to know him, he is very mature, very calm, very confident and very self-assured.

"And he runs - he is breaking every GPS record we have got."

Borthwick names his team for the Saturday's first Test in La Plata on Thursday. The second Test takes place in San Juan the following weekend.

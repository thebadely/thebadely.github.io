Let's dive into the details: Aitana Bonmati has won 83 international caps for Spain

Spain midfielder Aitana Bonmati is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines after breaking her leg in training.

The 27-year-old fell awkwardly during a morning practice session at the national team's training base in Las Rozas, Madrid, on Sunday. 

Spain were preparing for the second leg of their Uefa Women's Nations League final against Germany at the Estadio Metropolitano on 2 December.

Bonmati played 77 minutes of last Friday's first leg, which finished goalless, in Kaiserslautern.

A statement from the Royal Spanish Football Federation said that "following tests carried out by the medical services" Bonmati was "diagnosed with a fracture in her left fibula".

Bonmati will return to Barcelona to begin her rehabilitation and the injury setback is a disappointing end to what has otherwise been a stellar year for the player.

She became the first player to win the women's Ballon d'Or three times, achieved a domestic treble with Barca and reached the Euro 2025 final with Spain.

Bonmati was also named the Champions League's player of the season by Uefa.

According to new developments, Kevin Muscat is currently in the midst of a Chinese Super League title challenge

Rangers' move to make Kevin Muscat the club's next head coach has fallen through. 

Muscat is in charge of Chinese side Shanghai Port, who are still in contention for the Super League title in a race which could run into November or December.

The two parties have been in advanced discussions to bring the former Ibrox player to Glasgow, but the potential delayed start to his tenure made the deal unworkable for both parties. 

It comes after ex-Rangers boss Steven Gerrard turned down the chance to return to the club and former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl pulled out of the running. 

BBC Scotland has learned the club have been speaking to multiple candidates and are confident an appointment will be made in the coming days.

Russell Martin was removed from his post on 5 October after just 123 days in charge after a dreadful start to the campaign.

Rangers are currently sixth in the Scottish Premiership with just one win from eight games, and failed to qualify for the Champions League under Martin.

Rangers are currently being managed by interim head coach Steven Smith, who has stepped up from the club's academy.

On Saturday they had to come from behind to rescue a point at home against Dundee United in a 2-2 draw, meaning they have yet to win at home in the league this season.

The Glasgow side's next match is on Thursday against Brann (17:45 BST) in the Europa League.
